We upgraded on arrival for an additional $15.00 a night to a deluxe room, mardi gras tower. It was awesome. Nicely upgraded furnishings, very clean and a nice view of the pool and mountains from the little balcony (that was nice, I was able to smoke out there). Service was great all around from the front desk to the waitresses on the casino floor and in KGB restaurant. Great location. The only negative I can think of is the line at the front desk was long. We kept checking back but it never was shorter. I would not hesitate to stay there again and I think it is better than a Holiday INN, I normally stay at a Wyndham, Marriott or the Ritz Carlton when I travel.

I compare all the rates and fees and Harrah's always wins. I love the location, right in the middle of everything going on on the strip, it's right on the Monorail, it's got a shuttle to the Rio (great seafood buffet!) and the rooms cover your needs. We stayed in the Carnival Tower this time and had a view overlooking part of the strip. We could see (and hear and feel) the volcano at The Mirage erupting at night, which was very cool. That being said, I always bring a small white noise machine to drown out unwanted hallway, street and Strip noises so that I can sleep peacefully. The walls are thin and normal voices in the hallway can seem quite annoying. 3 more perks to staying at Harrah's: NO mandatory resort fee! This fee can really add up at the other hotels! And usually it covers services you don't even use! Instead, if you want to use the the internet you get charged for a 24 hr period of about $11.50. The rate is discounted with multiple days. Second- If you drive to Las Vegas, parking at Harrah's is FREE! yeah! Third- you can purchase a Buffet of Buffets pass that lets you eat at about 6 different resort buffets such as Rio, Planet Hollywood, Paris, Ceasars, Harrah's etc as many times as you want in a 24 hr period. This is a great option, especially if you have \"super eaters\" in your group! You can get this without staying at Harrah's, of course...... The only down side to our stay was that the window overlooking the strip was VERY dirty and kind of ruined our view.

The pull-out couch wsn't the greatest.. after a few attempts, it was determined the best way to sleep on it was with your head at the opposite end away from the couch. The room was pretty clean, although we did find a stale pretzel on the carpet when we first got there. But not a huge deal. The location was PERFECT. Right in the middle of the strip, with easy access to the monorail, and all the other hotels, restaurants and casinos. The price was great for the location, and the rest of the girls in my party got a late checkout as they had a later flight then I did. This made it easy to hang out by the pool all day and get ready, with somewhere safe to store their luggage. On the Sunday I was the first to arrive, a few hours earlier then my friends, and since the room wasn't in my name, I was worried about checking my luggage, but it wasn't a problem. It was easy to check it in, and then go wander the strip and shop until I left for the airport to meet my friends as they arrived.

You have to go through casinos to enter or leave many hotels, but Harrah's tops the others. The whole first level is nothing but casino, and a rather loud smoky one as well. The pool isn't particularly grand or fun, and it closes around 5 or 6 PM (in March). You usually have to wait in line to check in or out. No free wi-fi. I had read reviews on trip advisor, so our room was at least quiet. It was up high and on the other side from the incredibly loud outdoor party area in front. Most frustrating was that it was impossible to adjust the temperature in our room in any meaningful way. The thermostat seemed to ignore whatever setting you gave and just blew out air endlessly at whatever fixed temperature it had. Our room was too hot initially, so we had them come up and adjust the system. At that point it blew out cold air and got the room very cold by morning. I called them back the next evening, and they said I had a choice of too hot or too cold, with the air coming out either way at a fixed temperature. He suggested too cold, because you could always just shut it off manually , which I did in the middle of the night. Still, is it too much to want a heating cooling system you can set to a particular temperature, rather than one that blows out air constantly at either too high or too low a temperature?

Harrahs is a very comfortable hotel/casino, not huge like some and easy to navigate. Close to strip, next to Venetian, Accross from Mirage, Caesars, so easy to navigate to other places.

We stayed at Harrah's for the first time based on feedback from various TA reviews. With a little effort we were able to get our rooms for about $23 per night including all taxes/fees - allowing us to spend our money on some awesome shows. There are a lot of complaints from other TA reviewers about having to pay extra if you check in early. So, DON'T check in early! We arrived at the hotel before 10am and if we had checked in it would have cost an extra $25. Instead, we simply checked in our bags (free), completed our preliminary paperwork (locking in the best available room early), then we explored part of the strip in 70 degree sunshine, ate lunch, took advantage of a timeshare presentation (separate review) to get ourselves several free show tickets, a $50 visa card, and a free 5-couse Italian dinner (salmon & pasta which was very good). We stayed out until almost midnight THEN we finished checking into the hotel when there were no long check-in lines (another common complaint by other TA reviewers). The room was in the Carnival Tower and when we did our preliminary check-in I specifically requested a refurbished non-smoking room with a king bed on a floor that was NOT pet friendly (based on other TA reviews - great advice). We were on the 17th floor and there were no barking dogs and no obvious smoking odors (unlike almost everywhere else in Vegas). The room was quite large, the bed was reasonably comfortable, we achieved decent sleep when we decided to stop for a rest, the bathroom was large and clean, and the shower head had multiple settings with plenty of water pressure. All in all, especially considering that we paid less than $23 total per night, Harrah's met our needs for this quick trip. The location on the strip was very good - a little south of the Venetian complex which has many interesting things to see, like a very nice simulated Venice setting complete with real canals and gondola boats that you can ride if you choose. The grand entry has very high hand painted ceilings that remind one of Michael Angelo's works in Italy. There are shops galore and numerous restaurants to enjoy, including the Italian (of course) \"outdoor patio\" place named Tintoretto that we enjoyed our free dinner at. One of the free shows (another gift for enduring the timeshare presentation) that we attended was at the Venetian (Blue Man Group). Just to the south of Harrah's is Caesar's Palace then the Belagio - where they put on an awesome lighted dancing water fountain display set to music several times each evening (free). Right across the street from Harrah's is the Mirage where you can watch a simulated volcano erupt (blasts of water lighted to the color of molten magma along with huge natural gas fired flames and fire balls). This too is free to observe from the street or as we did, from the elevated vantage point on the front of the Venetian entryway. My one rather significant complaint about the hotel - which is true for many Las Vegas hotels except for some of the newer places - is the extremely poor ventilation in and around the casino and the hotel lobby.

We booked two months ago so the price was amazingly low at $45/night. By the time our date arrived, the price for the same room had jumped to $100+/night. So based on the smokin' deal we got, it was everything we expected plus more. I realize that if we had paid more then my review would be MUCH different. Check-in: Our flight arrived early at 1pm, so I was worried that we wouldn't be able to check-in right away. But the Front Desk woman, Judy, was super friendly and even offered us an upgrade. We moved from a Classic room to Deluxe room located in Carnaval Towers. Room 2858 was our first room with 2 Queen Beds. I originally booked a King Room but it wasn't quite ready yet. Judy went out of her way and offered the option for us to wait for King room (ready at 4pm) or take 2 Queen beds now and then she would arrange for us to switch and take a King room the next day. Room 2852 was basically two steps away so moving our stuff was a breeze. Well worth the move. Room: Exactly as shown in pics posted. It was clean; beds were comfy and pillows had an assortment of firm and medium support. Bathroom was clean and the shower water pressure was awesome. Best shower pressure I've had for a hotel room. Room had lower windows that opened which was a nice treat that allowed fresh air inside. Carpets definitely has seen better days. The hotel should look into replacing room and hallway carpeting in the near future. We couldn't hear any outside noise and the black-out curtains provided peaceful sleeps. Smoking: We were on a non-smoking floor. We couldn't smell any smoke inside the room, but when you stepped into the hallway you could smell the lingering smoke. Casino: Was one of the busiest casinos out of all hotel casinos we visited. The low ceiling heights made it quite smoky though, so if you are sensitive to smoke then I recommend going elsewhere to gamble. Location: Nothing better on the Strip. We walked to each hotel - from MGM to Encore and we definitely agree that no other hotel has a better location. I would say Mirage is a close runner up. Restaurants: We didn't try any of the buffets or restaurants since they are open & adjacent to the casino and it can be quite smoky. I prefer not to eat in places where I can smell cigarette during my meal. Someone noted there is a Starbucks on the second floor near Toby Keith's Grill which is never as busy as the Starbucks in the lobby. Comments: The Wyndham resort sales people situated next to Front Desk area in the lobby can be pushy and annoying. They ask personal questions right away in order to gauge if you are an appropriate potential \"Sale\" for them. Overall: I would recommend this to anyone who can get a great deal and can be upgraded to Carnaval Tower higher floor.

Mcdonalds, Panda express, mexican and pizza place next door which is handy for a snack to take back to your room. Starbucks by the front desk for your morning coffee and pastry. Small liquor shop which is useful to buy wine/beer/snacks etc. Prices not too bad. Huge variety of slots to play, and drink service was good with friendly waitresses. Ate in the coffee shop for breakfast and for the Italian night. Food tasty with good service. Use your Total Rewards card for a discount. Saw the Mac King show which I would recommend. Asked the concierge for help with booking Rugby 7s tickets but she was unable to help as they were using an outside supplier, but did give me toll free number to call. Slept well, hardly any outside noise and no hallway noise. Never had to wait more than 1 minute for an elevator and felt safe in this hotel at all times. Yes Harrahs may be old but she is an excellent choice for a stay right in the middle of the Las Vegas strip. I would def stay again, but only in a deluxe room.

Got a fairly good rate on a \"Mini Suite\" so we booked 3 nights Harrah's, then 2 nights at the Golden Nugget. First - The Good: We got in around 11 pm Sunday and got checked in quickly and easily thanks to Meshan at the front desk. We've been to Vegas 15 times and she is CLEARLY the best front desk person ever. If I ran a resort, I would definitely try to steal her away - she's pleasant, efficient friendly and cheerful - an amazing person. Room was nice-sized, updated, and very nice. The bed was comfortable, and the rooms were the quietest we've stayed in, which is a big plus.The Carnival tower is fantastic, as the casino is pretty decent and the location is STELLAR! If you want to be on the Strip, you can't beat it. The rooms are not as plush as Caesar's, but they're larger AND you can get out and hit the casino or be on the strip in a couple of minutes. My other big plus for them is their valets are lightning fast. We went to no less than 10 casinos and none were nearly as quick and friendly as Harrah's. THE BAD! We got into room and it was 80 degrees - called the desk and were told it's motion activated cooling. If no one is in room, no air flow. Drank and gambled until 2 am, etc.. next moring 78 degrees. We moved to a smoking room the next evening (again, thank you Meshan) to find it at 80 degrees. We were assured it would cool down (uh huh, sure). Next morning 78 degrees. Called again - desk said she'd send someone while we were out. (NO idea if anyone tried.) Got in at 2am ... yup 78 degrees. Called desk, were told they \"took care of it\" and it would cool down. I hung up. Woke up to ... 78 degrees. Called again, they said it would be taken care of. Left for the day, got in at 2am again, 79 degrees. Wife called and BEGGED (as I laughed in the background) and to my surprise a maintenance man got there in FIVE minutes and fixed it!!!! I didn't get his his name but he was great. The temp was below 70 in about 10 minutes. Of course, we had to check out 9 hours later so I can't give a great review. If you want to stay on the strip, Harrahs or Flamingo are really the best \"nice\" option for the price, provided you get an updated room. (The older rooms are NOT great.) But frankly, our stay at the Golden Nugget was wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy better and we may stay on Fremont street instead on the nest trip, as the Strip casinos are just getting too pricey and their gambling odds are now too much in favor of the house.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Cloud, Minnesota, United States", "Title": "\u201cOverall Great Stay\u201d", "Author": "Laura F", "ReviewID": "UR124451943", "Content": "My fiance and I stayed at Harrah's in Las Vegas for 4 days.

Our room faced the strip so we had a good view of TI and the Mirage where we could catch a glimpse of the volcano show. As we booked via expedia we had the free continental breakfast. We were very happy to learn that this would be $9 a day each which was enough for a large coffee and danish every day! The only reason I wouldn't give Harrah's 5* is because one of my biggest bug bears in Vegas is paper thin walls and Harrah's had thin walls. Luckily our neighbours weren't too loud but still I don't want to hear other peoples conversations - that being said it wasn't too bad.

Although we didn't get the suite we had last time (no big deal!), the room was acceptable for us, with the exception of one or two small problems (keep reading!). The rooms were clean, though ours was a small size. There was some noise from the clubs in one room, but not the other down the hall. Not that we were in Vegas to sleep, but just an FYI if you are on a low floor in the Carnival tower, this might be a possiblity. There was also a problem with the level of service in the restaurants, which left much to be desired. And FYI, they are working on the Carnival Court, transitioning it to the LINQ. Although we didn't hear the construction or have any major issues with construction, if this type of thing bothers you, go to a different property. We missed the Ghiradelli's ice cream store which used to be at this location. Having stayed at many other properties in Vegas, and in other casino towns, I was overall very happy with the stay. Just note, this is not a high end property-- don't go in with expectations it's the Bellagio/Wynn/Aria. It is a (mostly) high quality mid-range hotel, and it met the expectations I had with this type or property. The main reason I give it three stars, however, stem from some service issues, which had the other two members of my group a bit unhappy. They have asked that I write something on here, in hopes that Harrah's might take some notice. The property in Las Vegas some serious issues with staffing, particularly in their cafe-type place and other resturants. Before a show, we wanted to have a quick bite- and this seemed like the appropriate place, since the show was next door at the Imperial Palace. When we got to the cafe's entrance, there was a line-- this was at 6 pm. We waited a good 5-10 minutes before anyone came to seat any of the customers. The hostess then told all of us that it would be another 5-10 minutes-- maybe longer-- before anyone could be seated, despite the fact the place was practically deserted inside. The hostess proceeded to tell us that there were staffing issues. This employee seemed to indicate it was a somewhat persistant problem at this cafe's location. All four of the potential tables in line walked away and found dinner elsewhere. When I walked by later in the evening, after the show, I also witnessed the same thing happen to two more groups who had gathered. Harrah's needs to think about hiring, as I witnessed at least 15-20 people get turned away, thus costing them money. I also noticed not too many slot attendants around. The lack of staffing bothered me far more than the security incident/ customer fight in the lobby as we were at checking in (which the staff handled well)--and which would freak out most other guests. Major negative on Harrah's part here. Hire people! Be a positive economic driver! Have quick service! Make more money! Now for the bathrooms/the other small negative: In the two rooms we booked, both had leaky or defective showers. This was a suprise to me, having stayed at other Harrah's properties that have pristine, perfect bathrooms (not that this is something I look for, but it's a great plus). We called maintence for one of the rooms leaky and dripping faucet, but the problem was never fixed-- again, here's where service could be improved. It took two calls and two days for anyone to even look at the problem. Again, here's where Harrah's could hire someone, even part time, to improve on such services. Otherwise you will alienate guests who will not return to your properties. Service outweighs a lot of negatives. Additionally, you'd think in a drought ridden desert they'd be pretty good about water conservation. In the other room, the leak was less persistent. The bigger problem there was the handicaped shower. The bathroom slanted downwards and since it was a handicapped bathroom, there was no bathtub in the room or lip in the shower area to keep in water. Although this wasn't really a big deal/problem, for us be aware if you get such a room, there is a strong possibility when you shower, water will run into the other part of the bathroom, flooding it or partially flooded it (which happened to us a few times). Not the best thing in a handicapped room-- a way to make someone who is already mobilty impaired worse, should they slip and fall (I'm thinking along the lines of someone elderly who might need a cane/walker). However, the shower did have a hand held head, which we liked. Just be aware this might happen. I was also a bit stymied by the small size of the handicapped room. Since it was handicapped, I expected there to be more room between the furniture so that a wheelchair or walker could pass. This was not the case. The room was smaller than the standard, non-handicapped room our friend had down the hall.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kolding, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location, excellent value\u201d", "Author": "Camtin", "ReviewID": "UR123953238", "Content": "We just came back from our first visit to Las Vegas where we stayed at Harrah's.

Chose Harrah's because it is a true bargain (great room rates and no resort fees!), it's incredibly convenient to the Sands Convention Center and it's smack dab in the middle of The Strip. Stayed in Deluxe rooms in the Carnaval Tower. Very quiet on the back side near the parking garage. The side on The Strip can be noisy, especially if you're on the lower floors because of the Carnaval Court bands. The great room rates and lack of resort fees make Harrah's stand out. The other hotels nearby charge A LOT MORE and they really stick it to you with the infamous resort fees. Harrah's is also very convenient for getting out to other locations on the strip. Saves a ton on taxi fares. Plenty of free parking if you have a vehicle. We didn't dine here much....and the little dining we (attempted) turned out to be a pretty bad experience. Tried to have breakfast 2 days in a row at Harrah's Cafe. I say tried because it never happened! We got down there in plenty of time to make it to the trade show but on both days, we gave up after not being served in 30 minutes!! Not good. Ended up grabbing McDonalds next door in a rush to get to the show. This same experience happened to us a couple years ago.......should've known better but we hoped things had changed. We even prompted the server when we finally flagged her down that we needed to order quickly and be served in a timely manner. This is very frustrating......especially when the place wasn't even busy (maybe 15-20 people in the cafe, tops). Saw others leaving without their food, too. We mostly ate at Toby Keith's Bar & Grill in Harrah's and California Pizza Kitchen right across the street in Mirage and other restaurants within a few minute walk. Tons of places to eat within 10 minutes. The Range Steakhouse at Harrah's is great but a little pricey (but most steak houses in Vegas are really pricey). Room service comes late in the day but if you're out working a show or enjoying the city, that's not a big deal. Rooms are nice and big as are the bathrooms. For some reason these older hotels have very dark rooms....even with all the lights on. Bathroom lighting could really use a boost. Beds are very comfortable and our rooms were really clean.

Steps away to any needed amenities, it was nice to not have to jump on the Deuce all the time to get to where you wanted to go. Customer Service at check-in was great, they took care of all our requests. On the negative side of things - this could be a side effect of the bad economy, but it seems the prices of any 'in-casino' store or vendor have gone way up. Go to the Walgreens or if possible, get off the strip and into regular suburbia to pick up any supplies you might need. Also, check your receipts. The Starbucks on site overcharged regularly, for example, the price on the board would say '4.50' and then it would get rung up at '5.00'. Upon bringing it to the clerk's attention, they would just go 'Oh whoops' and give you your money back. Really, though, how many tourists are going to be checking their receipts? This was not the only place that this happened at in Vegas, it's really disconcerting when you see this happening not just at the 'lowly clerk making minimum wage' level, but across the board at reputable franchises 'manager on down' level (of course, the manager probably isn't making a ton of cash either).

Toby Keith Bar smelled good but we did not go in because it was SO LOUD & with country music which I can't stand.

The Wynn...not Harrah's. So started off at the check-in which aestetically appeared to rival the counter at a local gas station. It only took from start to finish about 15 minutes to check in. The good news was they had our room available. Entering the elevator, I was amazed to see the condition of the surrounding areas including the elevator itself. Not sure when the last time they cleaned it, including the buttons that were so pitifully tarnished...sad to see something so visable upon first entering, look so bad. Well we made it to our floor and I do have to say, I wasn't too surprised to find the hall conditions were just as bad if not worse. Jiminy Crickets, seriously like you can't invest a couple of dollars in new carpet. Ones that don't wrinkle all over from the years of wear and tear. The halls were dark and I ended up tripping on one of the wrinkle patches. To be honest at this point I wasn't expecting much of our room, and was I right. Holly schnikes...honestly one of the worst rooms I have ever seen in my life. I first vetured to the window to check out the view. It was a view of a brick wall and that of the parking garage. Nice! Right below valet so I was able to listen to the whistles of the valet parkers all night long. Everything looked well used, must be the last room they will be renevating (hopefully the other rooms did not look like this...especially at the rates I now see online). The bathroom had no cabinets or places of any kind to keep your toiletries. I discovered this when I tried to open one and the door fell off onto my foot. The lighting was so poor in all the rooms, even with the shades open for all that light to come in (yeah, right!). The internet cable was broken, so had to get a new one...which never ended up working anyway. The television was an early 1990 model that barely could get a picture in. We tried to change rooms to see if it was just that room, but they told us the place was booked. I was so shocked, how could that be. I thought to myself, maybe none of them had ever stayed here before either. Then I thought,maybe we are getting punked, but realized a) we weren't and b) we needed to be celebrities to get punked to begin with. The casino was one of the worst. Smokey, old, worn...looked like it should be visted by a wrecking ball soon because with such a great location, I'd imagine someone would buy it soon and build a nice resort/casino.

As for as the location is concerned, you really can't find a better value for the location. It's central strip and its located next to some very nice hotels (Venetian, Bellagio, etc.). Also, when you walk outside Harrahs, you are next to the small food court that's located on the strip with the McDonalds, Chipotle, and Panda Express (and maybe one or two more places...). This is especially good if you're traveling with a family and want to eat quick and cheap. Also, in terms of location, I will say that the Harrahs is very close to the booth where you can purchase show tickets at 50% off. This booth (forgetting the name) opens around 10 AM, so its a quick walk from your hotel and you can purchase tickets the shows the same day for significantly less than the box office. We used the valet service at Harrahs, which was very quick and courteous. They had heat-lamps outside, which made it okay to stand outisde in the cold while you waited for your vehicle. In the hotel, they have a Starbucks, which definitely comes in handy when you're up late or you wake up early. I would avoid Harrah's buffet - it's not a very good buffet. However, if you have to go, I think that same booth that sells tickets at 50% off sells coupons for discounted Harrah's buffet.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nanaimo", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "CGVancouverIsland", "ReviewID": "UR123326887", "Content": "Rooms a little tired but clean.

The room was pretty bare bones, no fridge, no coffee maker but there was an ironing board and iron. The tv could use some updating and they had a mini bar fridge but they had a huge STOP sign warning you not to use the fridge to cool your own drinks. We weren't tempted to use it because it wasn't cold anyways. They nickle and dime you to death at this place. No free wifi, you have to pay for all internet useage. No free phone calls either, $1.50 a shot. No free coffee in the lobby either. You can line up to pay $5 for a Starbucks coffee. I discovered a McDonalds next door with free wifi (had a lot of trouble using it) and decently priced coffee. We didn't eat at Harrahs so I can't comment on the food. They have servers walking around to bring you free drinks. Make sure you tip really well or you will have a hard time getting them to come back. Check in was easy and quick and the lady at the front desk was really nice and helpful. The cleaning staff were super and pleasant. In fact most of the staff that we dealt with were great.

It's like taking a budget airline vs a standard carrier, giving you the basics and nothing more (really). I can see why the reviews differ. Good and bad, depending on which of the following are important to you. The good: 1) Location is perfect and centralized 2) Room is spacious and the beds are big too (for small sized Asians like myself) 3) Free shuttle to Rio (off the strip) 4) Short walk to bus stops (Deuce/SDX) 5) Walgreens 24/7 at the Palazzo nearby 6) McD next doors with free wifi 7) Hair dryer, iron, ironing board, safe and tv provided The bad: 1) Poor lighting and cleanliness. You can all it ambience though. And the glasses in the bathroom had residue in and on them 2) See point #7 above? That's pretty much all that was provided. No slippers, no electric water kettle/coffee maker. There were 2 small pcs of soap, one shampoo, one lotion. That's it. 3) Shower head is not removable, and there is no shower cap. Maybe a small thing for some people. But the water flow is strong and good. 4) They seem to want to charge for everything in the room. There was a pack of toothbrush+toothpaste beside the fridge, and it said \"for sale\". BTW, it wasn't really a fridge. There was a warning on the door that said it was a mini-bar and we're not allowed to place anything inside. And the drinks inside were \"booby-trapped\" so once you take something out to see, $$$... 5) I can't really say much about the housekeeping. My toilet roll was finishing, but it wasn't replaced nor was an extra roll supplied. FYI, yes I did tip them. 6) Poor sound insulation. We could hear all the conversations in the hall, which were unfortunately not interesting material. 7) Poor air. Everytime we pass the casino to go out to the strip, my eyes sting just from the residual cigarette smoke. Though smoking isn't allowed in the lobby and on some floors, they still smell of smoke. Non-existent air filtering 8) Old and overused bed. The bed was too soft only in the center. And it's so overused that even if I lie on the side, I will roll and sink into the center Tips: 1) Go get your water from Walgreens, and bring a water kettle along if you want your own coffee or just some hot drinks. Nothing is provided, though room service will bring you a flask of hot water for more than 8 bucks. 2) Bring your own toiletries. There is close to nothing there. The shampoo and lotion is very little and again, they aren't replaced till you finish them completely. 3) If you don't need housekeeping, save it. There's not much difference and you save on tipping too. Just bring out your own trash. Towels and bedsheets aren't changed unless you explicitly request. 4) If you don't need the LAN connection, don't use the hotel's. It's freakin expensive. Go buy a coffee at McD next doors and enjoy the coffee and the free wifi. 5) Skip the restaurants and eateries at the hotel itself if not necessary. Bad air, long queue, mediocre food. If you're starving, there's a Big Hurt's Snack Shack kiosk right outside the hotel (not the McD exit) which is not bad and much cheaper. 6) For overseas travelers without a local number, note that even local outgoing calls from your room are $$.

We chose Harrah's because it's in the middle of the strip and it has a direct connection to the monorail (which saved us a ton of money over taxis). It also wasn't as expensive as some of the other hotels in the same vicinity. We chose a deluxe room which included a king sized bed, a tv in the bathroom, and a flat-screen tv in the living area. There were clear signs for how to get to the Mardi Gras tower, which is where our room was located. Everything was up-to-date and well maintained. The floors were clean. Our linens were changed on a regular basis during our week long stay. The casino buffet (Flavors) was on par but not exceptional. You can get a $5 off coupon to use for the meal in one of the free magazines. For lunch it cost the two of us $29 (with coupon); for dinner the price was $52 (with no discounts). Overall, the little bit of disappointment (and this is really just nitpicking) came with the view. When we got up to our room and drew the curtains, we had a view of the ventilation system. Really? Needless to say we didn't have a need for the balcony. Upon complaint, we were offered a room with a view of the Mirage Volcano but were warned that the band downstairs plays until 3am so unless we planned to be night owls, it probably wasn't the room for us. So, we stuck with the ventilation view so we could have a better night sleep. Unfortunately, the walls were thin enough that we could hear our neighbor's alarm clock going off for 2 hours straight for two mornings in a row!

After researching rates everywhere, Harrahs had the lowest rates on a mid-strip hotel for that time. We arrived at approx 5 p.m. on a Saturday, with no wait line to check in. We had booked the lowest rated \"Classic\" room, and were offered at upgrade to a remodeled room for $15/night, so we took it. It was still the best deal on the strip. The room was small, but very nice. There was a flat screen TV in the bedroom and bathroom. Everything was modern and the bed was incredibly comfortable. We stayed in the Mardi Gras tower with a horrible view, but that was fine. I had specifically requested a room away from Carnival Court....so no view, but quiet for sleeping. Housekeeping was perfect our entire stay. It was a non-smoking room and smelled great, no problems there. Food was expensive in the cafe, so hubby headed to McDonalds every morning right next door to grab us coffee, juice and food. It was much cheaper and very convenient. The location was perfect!! For SEMA, Harrahs being on the monorail made it easy and convenient to get back and forth to the convention center. For activities on the strip, Harrahs location was perfect as well! It was an easy walk to upscale shows and restaurants at Caesers, the Venetian/Palazzo, Bellagio, Cosmo and Aria. When we wanted some $5 Craps or Blackjack tables on the strip, Casino Royale was next door and Shea's was a very short walk away. Carnival Court always had music and fun at all hours when we just wanted to sit down, have a drink and people watch. Sure, the casino was a bit on the smoky side, but most of them are. Overall, the value was amazing. A great room, a great location and a very low rate for the week we were there. We had an amazing time! We would def choose Harrahs again. It definitely helps us stretch our budget in Vegas while staying in the middle of the action, in a clean, comfortable, modern room.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Appleton, WI", "Title": "\u201cNO resort fees\u201d", "Author": "tim2tyler", "ReviewID": "UR120963889", "Content": "This is the second vacation we spent at Harrah's.

Upon booking our trip like 7 months ago, I read lots of reviews on TA as I always do before planning a trip and like all places I read good and bad and decided to go with Harrah's for price and convenience. We had never stayed there, and hadn't been to Vegas in 11 years. Last visit we stayed at NYNY. Upon checkin we were offered to take the upgrade for add'l $15/night. I said let's check the room first, you never know. So we did. The room appeared fine, the bed was very comfy and since we didn't plan to spend time in the room we decided to stay with original booking. It was very mediocre. There wasn't even a comfy chair to sit in, just a small table with 2 dinette type chairs and the tv was old, but the room appeared clean and did not smell, it was o.k. Then the shower head was awful! There was not much pressure and the water leaked onto the floor and made a huge puddle. Hubby wanted to leave and go to upgrade and prob. could/should have, but didn't want to lug my stuff to another room, because the bed was very comfortable and that's really number one on our list. So, overall, I guess you get what you pay for, right? The location is prime, I mean it is right in the middle of the strip and the restaurants we ate in were good. Toby Keith's I Love This Bar is upstairs and was alot of fun. The piano bar is great, the bands out in the carnival court were usually really good and they had heaters out there and it was very comfortable at night. Overall I have to say average because the leaky shower would bring it way down, and lack of a comfy chair to lounge in too, but then the comfy bed and convenient location and other amenities that are right there, bring it back to average. We would not stay here again just because there are so many other options and we'd try another place, but it might not be until another 10 years or so. Overall Vegas is too damn smokey!

The location is fabulous, situated beside the Venetian and across the street from Caesars and Mirage. We stayed in the Mardi Gras Tower on the 10th floor in a room that has been upgraded. Nice flat screen TV's in room and the bathroom (not that we watched them). Bed was really comfortable pillow top mattress, nice linens and overall great comfortable space. We had a room with sliding glass doors to a very small balcony. This overlooked Carnaval Court. Other reviewers had mentioned that it is really loud and I was concerned when we checked in. However, when the glass doors are closed you can barely hear the music. I liked feeling a part of the party, from our room and it kept the lively Vegas feel still going, while sitting in your room or getting ready for a night on the town. We also had a small view of the Bellagio fountains and a bit of the strip. I have also read a lot of reviews on the air conditioner sensor. The system will only come on if it detects movement in the room. During our stay the temperature outside was in the 90's. When we would first come back to the room it was quite warm, but as soon as the air conditioner turned on, it cooled off very quickly. No complaints with this system. Check in was a breeze and we arrived on a Saturday at 3:30pm. The front desk was more than accomodating in looking to see what rooms were available to ensure we got just what we wanted. Check out was just as easy. No line-ups! There is a good choice of restaurants. We went to the breakfast buffet and there was a great assortment to choose from and everything was very tasty. We also tried KGB Burger and the burgers were really good. The portion sizes are really big too. There was no way we could each eat a burger and fries, so we split it. There is a $2 charge to split meals, but in the long run cheaper than buying two meals that we wouldn't have finished. I signed up for the Total Rewards program. The bonus was the coupon book. We were able to use the buffet coupon and paying $10/person for breakfast to each as much of what you want was reasonable. Unfortunately, this was a quick trip and we didn't get a chance to use any others at the Harrah's group of hotels (Flamingo, Caesars, Imperial Palace, Planet Hollywood, Bally's). The casino is small, but makes it easy to find your way out to the strip and enjoy the sunshine! I did notice a huge abundance of penny slots....this is a big change from my last visit many years ago, when it was hard to locate a nickel machine. Times have changed with the economy!

We all agreed that cleanliness and convenience were key so we decided on Harrahs for those reasons. we had read other reviews and weren't worried. We got just that. We arrived before check in time and could have checked in but our rooms would have been on different floors so we decided to wait so that we could get three rooms next to each other. The hotel was very accomodating. we had to wait, but so what we we did arrive early and, there were nine of us. They were not adjoining but we were fine with that. We had three rooms on the 15th floor., #s: 1533, 1535 & 1537. The beds were comfortable enough with comfy down comforters. The water was nice and hot but the water pressure was lacking. This was only my second trip to Vegas and I was told that that is a common thing in Vegas. With the water issue it wasn't a big deal. The drainage in the tub was terrible though, The air in my room, 1537, was clearly not working properly but the other two rooms were perfect. Housekeeping did a great job and were super friendly ladies. Tips were well deserved. The casino in Harrah's is, in my opinion, not so hot, it's dark and feels very confined, but I didn't spend much time in it anyway. TIP - for cheap and fun gambling hop on over the O'Shea's just next door. If your not familiar with tables games, as some of my girlfriends weren't, the dealers are GREAT. yes, it's old and a bit divey but good times. I didn't visit the pool - we were pretty unlucky with weather, but a couple of he girls did and said it was pretty cool and would've been fun to hang out at for at least a day if the weather was right. The Spa-one of the girls said it was really nice. Not the top of the line but she had a facial and a massage and loved them both. She told me the facilities were clean and welcoming. If I had had the time I so would have had a body treatment. Room service-tasty and a bit pricey but not really that pricey for what you get and, it's room service so it's always a bit more expensive. Restaurants- Starbucks. imited selection of food but the salads, muffins and breads are top notch and with no coffee pots in the rooms we had it was nice to have it in the buidling. There is also a McD's next door for cheaper, tastieer coffee anyway. I'm a Dunkin girl so Starbucks is just.. Starbucks, Friends went to the cafe for breakfast and it was good. Nothing extraordinary. Toby Keiths and KGB-both AWESOME!!!! Toby Keith's is down home fun. We went there a couple of times and all the food was delicious, especially the BBQ sandwich. KGB's burgers are OUT OF THIS WORLD!! All in all we had a great stay. No problems except for the minor ones but we went in knowing we weren't staying at Bellagio.

There were stains on the edge of the sheets on the queen bed we didn't use. The area around the hotel (Especially the Carnival Court area) was nasty. The place just looked like it was getting run down and unkept. The perimeter of the property seemed to attract lots of vagrants, beggars and people trying to shove \"sex trade\" cards on you. The buffet has been steadily going downhill for a couple of years too. Their buffet used to be one of our favorites. Not any more. The breakfast is still good, but lunch & dinner have definitly suffered the effects of the economic downturn. We tried the 24 hr. buffet pass, and checked out a few other places. Planet Hollywood was okay. Not as good as I was expecting. Ceasers had one of the smallest buffets I have been to in Vegas, but the food quality was pretty good. The carved meats were excellent. The Flamingo was the cleanest, with lots of choices and good quality food. They were my favorite of the four we checked out. I know it sounds like we ate way too much, but since we had the 24 hr. pass, we didn't feel we had to stuff ourselves to get our money's worth. It's a good buffet offer that allows you to check out several places, while eating smaller ammounts. Last, but definitly not least. The gambling. Slots in particular. I know things are tough in this economy, but give me a break! We used to be able to put a hundred in a dollar machine and hit at least a couple of twenty or forty dollar payouts, if not more. We used to be able to play a hundred in a machine, and still be there long enough to have a waitress come by and take a drink order and return with your cocktail. Not so much, the last couple of years (Especially this year). I'm not saying I expect to win every time I sit at a machine, but at least let me play for a while. And those nice ladies that serve the drinks. Their numbers seem to have gotten significantly lower. When they do make it around, they are as nice as can be, but at times, you might sit around for 15 or 20 minutes before you see one in the area. Harrah's never was the nicest place on the strip, but it was pretty darn good, with a decent location and price. The buffet used to be our favorite and the gaming paid off better.

Only thing I will be leary of is the 24 hour buffet package that they sell....if you plan on staying close to those locations, watching the time closely (if eating is what you want to do), then this is for you....if you are, on the go type, this may not be your thing....they are STICKLERS when they say 24 hours....as we were standing in line for buffet when our's expired.....didn't honor it....spoke to managers and they all had same reply...\"no exceptions, it's 24 hours!\". So, stear clear of that...unless gambling and eating is the ONLY thing you do. (There are several buffets, at several hotels included...you just have to PLAN where you'll be for 'feeding time'.) Didn't work for us, but may work well for others. Over all, we would stay there again.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greensburg, PA", "Title": "\u201cGood price - good location.\u201d", "Author": "Watchdog328", "ReviewID": "UR118909349", "Content": "We've been to Vegas many, many times and try to stay at at different hotel casino each visit.

Especially for the price. I liked where they have the check-in area. Although it's located at the back of the hotel, it makes it much easier to get in and out of the hotel. This is important when your trying to avoid a extremely crowded strip on most any night. Rooms are okay. Try to stay away from the pool side if you want a quiet evening. I understand the bands are very loud and go on late into the night. I heard them when we were out.........and they are loud. Because of it's location, you can walk to most of the other major hotel casinos and you're pretty much in the middle of all the action.

Every year we stay somewhere different just to see what each hotel is like. This year Harrahs and Imperial Palace were our choices, we had 6 comped nights. I will write a seperate reviw for each of the two hotels we stayed at. This one for Harrah's only. I had read several reviews about how the AC units could not be set to a comfortable temperature because they are on an echo friendly system and that was a real concern for me because there is nothing worse than coming in for the night to a hot room and no way to set the temperature. We asked upon check in if that could be fixed and the girl at the reception desk said she would send someone up to fix it. As soon as we got in our room someone was knocking at the door to overide the system.... it worked perfectly.We had a nice $16.00 cab ride from the airport...told the driver we wanted the cheapest route and that is what we got. $16.00 + tip divided three ways was not bad at all. Arrived at the hotel at around 11:00 a.m. and only had to waite in line about 10 minutes before we got our room. We were not asked which tower we wanted so we just took our chances. We got a room in the back of Carnival Court... nice and quite. short walk from the elevator and no noise at all. Beds were comfortable and no little creatures sleeping with us. There was not much of a view but we were not in Vegas for the view. We went down to play some slots and get something to eat. We ate at Flavors and were surprised at how many choices the buffett had. It was pretty good. Again we had a coupon for buy one get one free, spit three ways stilll not bad ...about $11.00 each. Slots were very tight and no one won any money there. We decided after the first night that this was a very large casino and all of us being in our late 50's were not up to all of the walking around and we needed something smaller next time. All of the staff were very friendly and we were close to many of the other casinos on the strip and easy to walk to Imperial Place, Casino Royal, O'Sheas, Flamingo. Caesars. and Bills. We had a great time and enjoyed our stay at Harrah's. The only thing that was a little bit of a dissipointment to us was to see the half naked girls dancing on a small stage up in the air around the table games which were right by the entrance to the caino. All of the small children going by the doors could watch this. I am not a prude but ths was a little bit too much for smaller children to see. They need to have them sort of in the middle of the casino but of course it is all about the marketing and what will draw people in. The bus ride up and down the strip was miserable. They pack you in like cattle and keep telling you to move back when there is no room to back up to. Quite a few homeless people on the streets begging for money or cigarettes so be careful of being alone on the streets anywhere. There are also alot of drunks stubling around. All in all this was a good trip and we enjoyed our stay at Harrah's.

I obtained a fabulous deal for flights and accommodation through Travel bag but it did involve 3 flights there and back! Not for the faint hearted. Having gotten such a good deal I was a little worried about the hotel standard. I have been to Las Vegas before so I knew Harrahs was in a good location and furthermore I checked previous comments on Tripadvisor about the hotel but quite frankly they did not do it justice. If you want five star do not even consider Harrahs but for a no frills four star this is your place! I booked a smoking room and when I arrived the Receptionist said she had none. I was about to complain when she offered a room with a balcony which you could smoke on - first tick for the hotel. The room was close to the lift ( without asking ) thus near the ice machine and soft drinks machine. Some might think this would be a noisy locale but we were not disturbed. Room had two large double beds, 37 inch LCD LG TV and a smaller one in the bathroom!!! The room was immaculately cleaned every day and extra towels left without having to ask. - big tick here! We were not overlooking the swimming pool nor the night club so no noise disturbance but in fact could see the Mirage hotel opposite and a great view of the mountains in the distance ( fantastic sunsets!) Looking down wasn't the best view - but who's looking down! Staff were friendly in all areas- quite frankly can't say enough about them especially as it was so busy and they still kept smiling! Loved the Oyster Bar, loved drinks in the pool - watch out for the cocktails in the Harrah cups - $17.00 a pop but you only need one; but beyond a doubt the best thing about Harrah's is the dueling piano bar. It is rocking from Thursday to Saturdays; still good on the other nights but not quite as busy. it closes at 2am so we would get there from 12 on wards. There are many places to go to in Las Vegas but loved coming back to the piano bar. When that is closed if you have any energy go to the night club outside the entrance to the hotel - another rocking place! Las Vegas has become more expensive over the time I have been going there but of course the free drinks at the slots and gambling tables can make a difference there and you can still eat cheap if you look around.

She made sure to have our room clean before it was time for us to get ready for the ceremony.

The front desk clerk was unable to accomodate us for the first night but put a room with a better view on hold for us for the rest of the week. The next day, when we entered our new room we discovered that not only did we get an awesome view but we were also upgraded to an awesome room. The cocktail waitresses in the casino provided the best service on the strip in my opinion. I asked about some lessons on table games becasue I noticed that the hotel's website advertised that free instruction was available daily. However, I asked three different people and all told me that they did not give any instruction on any of their games. So many other casinos do though so we just went to a different casino to learn craps. The quality and price of food was average for Las Vegas, good but nothing special. The Carnival Court bar was our favorite just because it was the most lively on the strip the week we were there. All of the other bars were dead for some reason.

Harrah's is starting to show its age compared to many of the newer, swankier hotels on the strip, but it's always been a solid brand and we have stayed at their Kansas City location several times with no problems. The hotel is centrally located which was nice because I was attending a conference at the Venetian about 2 blocks away (walking is essential in Vegas... too much, in fact.) Plus, Harrah's has a monorail stop which can easily take you up and down the strip as needed. My problems with the hotel are the following: --They installed some \"green\" thermostats that don't kick the A/C on until there is movement in the room. Good idea, right? Well, they've got them cranked down so hard that they turn off after 5 minutes - until there is more movement. The room was EXTREMELY hot (it was a hot week) so you'd lay down in bed, the A/C would kick on then you'd be still and the A/C would kick off. We literally had to keep kicking our legs up in the air to attract the motion sensor to kick the air back on. --The noise. Now, we're not crazy people, we know all about the 24/7 nature of Vegas. But we ended up with a flock of children(not teens, not tweens, but babies and kids) in our room next door that were up until 4 am one night. When the A/C was on, it kind of drowned them out, but see note above - IT KEPT TURNING OFF!!! --We did complain twice to the front desk staff, who historically have been very reasonable and accomodating about such things, but they shrugged both complaints off. (Once about the AC and once about the noise.) Maybe that's not enough to rate the hotel so poorly, but it is enough for my wife and I to decide not to stay there anymore.

Another upside was the restaurants, there are multiple ones inside the hotel all very reasonably priced and everyone we tried was outstanding! We had a breakfast and the italian night at the Cafe good prices, outstanding services, huge amount of food and all very very tasty. We also tried the KGB burger joint, that was out of this world.. by far best burgers either of us have ever had!! And the cocktails were very yummy standard booze prices for Vegas.

No apologies, no help in getting our stuff back, no compensation - lost suitcase with all clothes and toiletries as well as our airport carry on bag with a Nook and mini-computer. When asked if we should call the LVPD we were told we didn't need to worry about it, their security would handle it. We stupidly believed that they were looking out for us. When we finally went to LVPD four days later after Harrah's could not give us a straight answer - the cop told us that we should have called immediately when it happened. Harrah's is liable but since we waited there was little they could do other than take a report. It amazes me that this hotel would care so little about trying to help out their guests in a situation like this. I will never stay at Harrah's or any other property owned by Caesar's Entertainment Corporation. It really makes me sick that a big hotel chain such as this can care so little about guest satisfaction but it will not make a difference in their turnout.

I just need to keep my butt in the pool all day long and be happy and I was. Was able to put my purse and clothes on a table right near the pool and was able to keep an eye on it the entire time.

Drinks were a great value ( Im a beer girl, so $6 for a beer or $20 for a bucket of $5 ) was quite the deal!!! I got used to the pool right away. The check in was suprisingly quick and efficient. We actually stayed at MGM mid week, then switched to Harrahs for the more affordable weekend rate. They were able to check us in early, which was a plus. We were in the Carnival tower and it was very close to the front desk/pool/Toby Keith Bar/casino. It was extremly convienient and easy to navigate. Drink service was great as well. Whether I sat at a penny slot or a table, the service remained the same. Stopping to gamble in some of the nicer hotel and casinos we noticed the drinks service was very poor compared to Harrahs. Our room was very nice and a good size, clean and had the basic amenities one would need. My husband always has to go to Toby Keiths, other than the giant Coors Light in mason jars, I dont enjoy it very much. Not a country girl and I think the service was slow just like the last time we were there. Great location on the strip. Cant beat it!

The view in the queen room was of the volcano on the strip, which we enjoyed watching, the \" view\" in the king room was of all the room windows of the Imperial Palace.

All of these items were in the queen room. We were being picked up for brunch by family that live in Las Vegas, so there was no time to go down & request our original room back.

The atmosphere at Harrah's is lively inside and out, and getting out of the hotel/casino itself doesn't take an hour like it does at many of the newer, larger properties in Vegas.

Aside from that, the rooms are clean and easily accessed. My room was quite small but very well updated--but a couple of friends had rooms that were bigger however in great need of updating. In any event, the room is a safe, comfortable, fine place to sleep. If you want a room with ambience, a fancy pool (they have one, but it's nothing special), or glitz and glamour in your hotel's casino, stay somewhere else.

The room was closest to elevators, but far enough that I never heard any noise from there. It was overlooking the pool, and had view was that of Imperial Palace, and Caesars Palace.

The furnishings were older, tube TV, but again everything was well maintained. The bed and pillows were super comfortable. The bathroom was above average size and also very clean, and had a coffee maker - useful for me.

The room had one burned out light, but I didn't care nor did I report it to maintenance to get it fixed. The few times I dealt with the hotel staff they were all very friendly and helpful.

The location of this property is very central, so you can walk anywhere, you have a Mcdonald's right next door, which has free wifi.

Our room was in The Mardi Gras Tower. It was a good size and clean, albeit a little 'tired' looking. I feel some upgrading is necessary. Check in was a positive experience for us but, as far as I'm concerned, that's where the customer service ended. We just became faceless guests, who received no benefits from staying at Harrah's. Beware the 'compilmentary' Mac King ticket. If you use it you have to buy two drinks @ $9.95 each. Therefore, the show is not free. Also, if you go to see Mac King you can claim a 2 for 1 buffet voucher. . . but to do this you need to pay $5 each to upgrade to VIP seats, so at Harrah's it's true that nothhing in Vegas is free! The last time we were in Vegas we saw Mac King (who is excellent!) so we asked at Total Rewards if it would be possible to have some kind of concession if we went to the Improv. The answer was no. Then there's the gym! I have never stayed in a hotel where I have been expected to pay to use the fitness suite. It is open from 7am - 7 pm and will cost you $20 if you visit before 4pm. After that it's $10. This seems quite steep when all you want to do is run 5 miles on the treadmill. A couple of years ago we stayed at The Orleans and every time we used the lifts to the rooms we had to show our room card. No such system was in place at Harrah's, so I can only surmise that anyone could go up to the guest rooms. Our room had an adjoining door, so if you are unlucky enough to get a thoughtless neighbour, this could prove to be an issue. We had to put up with some loud television noise on one night. Finally - a security fixed iron! I've never come across that before. It has never crossed my mind to steal an iron from a hotel. Maybe this little touch is a reflection of the view Harrah's has of its clientele! (And the time -share Wyndham Resort touts were an irritation!)

I presented my Rewards Card as well as a $20 bill at the counter hoping to get an upgrade. The clerk was pleasant but did not accept my tip. We got there Sunday evening at 5:00 pm and they said our room wasn't ready yet, but for an extra $15 a night, they have a room ready. Really? I need to mention that we had two rooms (one for my son and his girlfriend) and they had theirs ready but not ours. We weren't even on the same floor which we expected because one was smoking and ours was not. We made our reservations many months ago, our flight was an hour delayed anyway, so I was not happy with this news. The manager came over, tried to sell us the $15 upgrade again, told me we would have to keep calling the front desk to see if our room was ready yet, then finally told me he had a room ready. Again...really? This is how you treat repeat customers. I was not loud or unruly and there was no line waiting. I won't stay there again only because of the way we were treated at check-in. There was no call for this. And on top of that, he gave us a beautiful room with a view of the Mirage volcano. Why did it take so long? Granted the room was much smaller than the room my son got but we didn't mind. The room was very comfortable and clean. We did have trouble with the noise in the middle of the night even though we were in the Carnival Tower. There was an adjoining room to us and they came in loudly each night at 3 am. We put blankets on the threshhold of the doorway because you could see their lights shining through and hear every word they said. And I realize that it probably works both ways. We will go back to Flamingo next time or maybe try out Bally's. The pool at Harrah's has very little sitting but I went out there early each morning and was able to get a chair. If you got there after 9:30 a.m., you had trouble finding one near the water. I like the pool at Flamingo much better. It's a shame they treated us like they did at check-in because I like many things about Harrah's. Toby Keith's is awesome, the location is fantastic, and the beds are great!

ARRIVING Took a cab from the airport. My husband told me prior that since the lobby / parking area is around back for Harrah's it would be more cost-effective and faster if we just told the driver to drop us off at Imperial Palace. Which we did, and just walked through the casino to the lobby. Short walk and we had only carry-on. CHECK-IN Arrived early (around 1030am) when check-in is usually 4pm, but luckily our room was ready. ROOM Your basic no-frills kinda room. 2 beds, non-flat/non-HD TV, small table and 2 chairs near the window. Good size washroom (for 3 of us to get ready in). **Our other friends arrived the next day, was asked for a room close to ours and was lucky enough to get the room next to ours which so happened to be adjoining. We used the safe to put our passports, keys and cash, worked out fine. however it's very tall and shallow. (Ex. if you have a laptop you have to stand it up vertical in there). The safe in our friends' room didn't work but we had to be in the room for them to come up and fix it (but the wait was an hour), so they just used ours the whole trip, which was fine. BED Sheets & pillow cased aren't anything to rave about. Feels like your average polyester cotton blend type, but clean and crisp nonetheless. Pillows were to mushy and soft for my liking. BUT getting into bed around 4am every night means that none of this really matters. LOCATION Excellent! Harrah's is the self proclaimed 50-yard line of the Strip, and it's right! It's within walking distance of the other hotels going North or South. The only place we took a cab to was The Hard Rock since it was off the strip. We walked every where else, from Fashion Show Mall to the Coca Cola store. FOOD We ate at the Mitzie's Cafe (i think that's what the name was) the day we left, and the portions are huge! (which we noticed was the standard in vegas). Nothing gourmet but sandwiches and soups were great! Service was good, was seated fairly quickly. CHECK-OUT We received a late check out of noon, flight was at 5pm, so we left our luggage in the room, was given a tag and came back for it. Was all accounted for when we did come back.

They're all old, fat, and worthless. Trust me, they have people scoping the hallways to see when you leave. The way it looked, is seems to be an inside job. This isn't only my opinion, see the other opinions on the other sites. PLEASE BEWARE!!!

We picked Harrah's because it's pretty central. So, first of all to that lost point....we arrived after an 11 hour flight.....not a huge queue for check-in but only 2 people checking guests in. Waited over an hour - really annoyed me, there is no need. I could feel my life ebbing away...Apparently they were short staffed....I don't care, not my problem.!! So anyway, when we finally got our rooms they were pretty nice. 3 standard rooms, all in the Carnival Tower, floors 16, 17 & 18. 2 rooms over looked the pool, the other the back of the hotel. Clean, good size, comfy bed. No complaints at all about the room. Housekeeping was great, lovely lady, she noticed the birthday cards in my room and when she saw me in the hallway she asked me if it was my birthday (it was) and she wished me a happy birthday. I saw her the next day and she asked how my day had been. How nice that she took the time out to ask. Drinks service is good in Harrah's! We gambled in the casino most mornings before breakfast & late evening. Good selection of slots, didn't play the tables here, but did play next door at Imperial Palace which is also a Harrah's property - see my other review. The guy out back at the taxi line was a nice chap too - hooked us up with a 6 seater & driver to take us out to brunch one morning - the driver - Michael - was also a cool guy and entertained us on our short journey. So, if it hadn't been for the stupid check-in queue Harrah's would have got 5 stars. All the staff we spoke to were really helpful, the rooms were nice, bed was comfy, room was quiet, place was clean. Yeah, Harrah's isn't one of those fancy hotels, but we had a blast.

So went to get something to eat, came back and the room smelled better.. enough to go to sleep. The bed was wonderful! It was more comfortable than my bed at home. I thought that I would be cold because ther are no comforters on the bed, but I was was wrong. They have down comforters. I ended up not changing room, but had to get them to ionize it again. There were clean towels and washcloths everyday. The location is perfect. They claim to have a shuttle that takes you to Ballys, and Rio. But the shuttle takes you to the Rio and then you have to get on the shuttle to take you to Ballys. Doesn't make sense because Ballys is closer. Strange.

The room was clean, included a safe and extra pillows, ironing board, iron and toiletries. We had a view of the strip and the roof of the casino area. The colors in the room were neutral, mostly browns and tan colors. There are two chairs and a small round table. Lighting could be better, but it was adequate. My husband and I were looking forward to actually putting to good use the mini bar that is supplied in the room. We were surprised to find that it wasn't a mini bar that we were used to. The mini bar contained 4 large bottles of water and shaving cream, razors, tampons, etc. It wasn't what we thought. It also included a sign that stated that we could not place any of our personal drinks in it even though there was plenty of room. All in all, however, the bed was very comfortable---just right after a long day and night at the casino and strip.

Due to our intinerary we actually booked in 3 times. The staff on reception were always really helpful from Elaine who helped show us the 'ropes' of Vegas to Taj who gave us a fabulous upgrade and chatted to us about Hot Springs where we had just spent time with friends. The rooms were all (3 of them) well set out, clean and cool. The best of which was the last room which turned out to be a suite, with spa bath and even the TV built into the mirror. It was difficult to know what to do................go visit the sights of Vegas or sit in the spa and watch tv! The food and service in the buffet was excellent value but allow plenty of time and room to make sure you experience it properly. The hotel is located in the middle of the strip and is very American - think cowboys and country music rather than the city themed places like Paris etc. The other hotels we visited were pretty much the same although some on a bigger scale. I am not sure if bigger makes for better though in a cty that is full of glitz and pertains to have glamour. I would recommend everyone visits Vegas at least once in their life and a must see trip is the Grand Canyon (the longer you can stay there the better and being at 6000 elevation it is cooler!) However be careful with your choice of timing as the heat in the summer months can be too much unless you really do like to be hot and sticky or are going to be inside gambling, which brings me to the biggest drawback.

Housekeeping was prompt and experienced no problems at all with our stay. I would also recommend the buffet at Harrah's, Flavors. It was actually really good. I ate here for breakfast once, and lunch twice. The 24 hour \"buffet of buffets\" pass is the way to go. It's like $44.00 and you can eat at any Harrah's/Caesar's owned property's buffet for a 24 hour period. We bought ours at 7:00pm on Thursday night, ate at the Spice market buffet at Planet Hollywood (it was great) for dinner, then we had breakfast at Harrah's on Friday, Lunch at Harrah's on Friday, and Dinner at the buffet at Paris (damn good) on Friday night all for a total of $44.00. I was eating so good that I was sick of prime rib and crab legs! Also lounged out at the pool on Friday and Saturday... It is pretty hard finding a place to lay down, but once you do, it's great! Good music, and a bucket of five 16oz. beers was only $20.00. Not bad for a Vegas Pool experience. Bottom line is this...

We chose to stay at Harrah's because my husband & I, as well as my in-laws, were able to comp our rooms. My husband & I were given the choice to upgrade our room for $10 a night & we jumped at the chance. We had a great room on the 14th floor in the Mardi Gras tower overlooking the pool with Caesar's Palace to the right of us & the mountains to the left. I had read other reviews of people complaining of the noise from the Carnaval Court below ..... we heard absolutely nothing. We loved the convenience of the location of Harrah's to EVERYTHING from other hotels/casinos & the monorail to McDonalds & other cheaper places to eat. We found that the slot machines in Harrah's brought us luck although the table games just took our money. We greatly enjoyed breakfast in both the cafe & Flavors buffet. We also greatly enjoyed drinks & entertainment in the Carnaval Court at night. My husband & I took advantage of a couples massage on my birthday & were VERY impressed by the couples suite complete with mimosas, fresh fruit, & one of the best massages we have ever had. We never actually went to the swimming pool, but could easily see it from our room. The pool area was VERY small with limited lounge chairs. It was extremely crowded during daytime hours & it was not something we wanted to deal with when we could be exploring the strip. Overall, we enjoyed staying at Harrah's. The rooms aren't as nice as the rooms in other Harrah's hotels (such as the Harrah's in New Orleans), but they are certainly adequate, clean, & comfortable. We stayed at the Vdara in March of 2010 & knew that the two hotels were in totally different classes. However, having that said, Harrah's did not disappoint us, especially since we (voluntarily) paid $40 for 4 nights. We could've paid nothing at all. The only reason why I rated Harrah's a 4 as opposed to a 5 is because of what they did to my in-laws (which honestly, if I based my review on the following, I would've rated it a 1). My in-laws changed the dates that they would be staying at Harrah's a few months before our stay. My mother-in-law changed the reservation online & was given a confirmation number which was the same number as their original reservation. Two days before we planned to leave Vegas, my in-laws were alerted to the fact that they should be checking out the following day. When they went to the front desk to straighten things out, the receptionist insisted that a change in reservation had not been made & that there was \"no way\" the same confirmation number would be given for a changed reservation. Attempting to avoid any further inconvenience, my in-laws requested a room for one night & were willing to pay for it even though it should've been a comp room. The response of the receptionist was that \"according to their point play, there are no rooms available for the night\". That one comment lost the business of my in-laws, who have been loyal to Harrah's for many, MANY years & also lost the business of my husband & I. We checked my in-laws into the Excaliber with no problems the following evening & upon our return to Vegas in January 2012, we will be choosing a MGM/Mirage hotel.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Henderson, nv", "Title": "\u201cNice rooms but noisy neighbors\u201d", "Author": "NevadaDale", "ReviewID": "UR115287511", "Content": "The check in line seemed to take forever but in reality it didn't take longer than most.

We stayed on the 27th floor with a view of the parking lot and Imperial Palace. Our room was spacious and clean. The people across the hall and a few other rooms on the floor had people who seemed like they were staying in a hotel for the first time. They talked loudly (yelled), played loud music, and put their McDonald's trash in the hallway. I can't blame this on the hotel though. We didn't do much while there because we had specifically stayed at Harrah's to see a band we liked at Toby Keith's I Love This Bar and Grill. We had dinner there where we got a small discount with our Total Rewards card and had also received a coupon for 2 for 1 entree from a text from Harrah's. Food was pretty good and service was very good as well. The drinks are expensive but large. The place is very adult and male oriented. The waitresses wore outfits that looked like one piece swimsuits with chaps or holsters and HOTTIE was printed across their behinds. I do have to say there were older couples and kids in the place that seemed to be enjoying themselves as well. After our nice dinner we left for awhile and came back when it was time for the band. Stayed all night and had a great time. Whistle blows and free shots are poured directly into patrons mouths from the bartenders at the bar. Fun place. When we got back to our room after 3AM our noisy neighbors were still yelling down the hallway. Good nights sleep and easy checkout on the TV.

At Harrah's their standard beds are decent. The rooms are generic with no real flare. A little narrower than usual but this didn't matter. The crowd at Harrah's is a budget crowd. Meaning the folks there are less likely to be interested in what they look like and more interested in playing games. The Casino in my opinion is perfect.

Also, DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT go to the cafe/restaurant for anything that resembles food. You will be eating grease laden facsimiles of food and the staff wasn't very polite.

We arrived late and the hotel was full so we were assigned a room on the 3rd floor which is a pet friendly floor and our view was of air conditioning and kitchen vents and a catwalk. Not the best, so we kept our curtains closed. The room did have a nice bathroom with a flatscreen TV and the room also had a flatscreen TV. The bed and the pillows were amazingly comfortable. Unfortunately, after going to bed very late we were woken up at around 6:30 am by screaming kids and an angry mom along with barking dogs. We requested a room change and got it without problem. Our second room was in the carnival tower which had similar rooms but had older tube style TVs and the rooms were not as pretty as they were in the mardi gras tower, but they were bigger and the view was of the pool and strip. We had no problems at all with the room and the beds were just as comfortable. We did have a sight problem with the AC shutting off at night as the AC worked on a motion sensor but was not too big of a deal. The location of Harrah's was amazing as it is mid strip, across from Caesars Palace and within walking distance of most of the main attractions. In terms of location, Harrah's is hard to beat. We did go to the pool on two occasions and I will say that I would not stay here for the pool, it is small and there is not a whole lot of room. We did not have a hard time getting a lounger, but we did have to go to the 2nd level and the 3rd level the second day to get a lounger. The pool is on the first level. The casino is very smoky so for me, it was not the place I want to be, especially when a smoker decides to sit next to you but there are many other casinos that have better ventilation systems that you can play in. I recommend the Wynn or the venetian they are super nice. We did got to two shows, Mystere and Le Reve for which we purchased tickets for at tickets4tonight and got our tickets for less then $100 each for really good seats. Definitely recommend these shows, they were fantastic. We only ate at one restaurant in the Hotel, KGB burger which was great. Best burger I ever had and we were able to use 2 for 1 coupons that we got on check-in. (Be sure to ask for coupons when you check in). They let us use two coupons at our table of 4 for the burgers were less than $10 each with fries. Great deal! They also have these really great sweet potato tots there which are really good.

Harrahs is a good average hotel/casino in a great location. We upgraded to a suite this trip but have stayed in a regular room in the past. We were in the Carnival Tower suite 3106 facing east...in my opinion the only good view at Harrahs is a high floor facing east. It is surrounded by so many tall buildings that any other view is not worth it. Suite was cleaned early every day and no complaints about housekeeping. Arrived at noon on a Monday with no line at checkin. Between my poor hearing and the desk clerks accent there was a bit of communicaion problem. When we arrived in our room the internet wasn't working, hubby talked to their internet people on the phone and when we returned a few hours later it was working fine (they had to reboot something). All the games you want to play in a casino are here with many dining options. We also like the neighboring properties Casino Royale, TI, Venetian, IP. The past 2 years that I have played here their slots have gotten so tight they squeak. We rent a car and head away from the strip everyday where our gambling money lasts a lot longer. If you have a car, gamble downtown, out on Boulder Hwy or way south down at South Point, Silverton, M. The strip casinos have been offering great prices and have the nice shows but will suck your gambling budget dry. We use to be Platinum players with CET properties and the past few years we felt like playing their slots was like throwing our money straight into the trash. FYI- harrahs regular rooms are on the small side, the ONLY difference between Classic, Deluxe and Luxury are....view, lack of view, remodeled (those have the tv in bathroom and coffee makers). The size of these rooms are the same. You do NOT want to face Carnival Court unless you don't go to bed until 3 am. ALL CASINOS in Vegas allow smoking , Harrahs being an older property may seem smokey to some, I personally didn't notice a smoke factor difference than any other casino. There is NO RESORT Fee at this hotel therefore you will pay for internet and fitness center...ALL casino hotels in Las Vegas charge for these OR they charge a resort fee which can include these. So do not be surprised. Anyone complaining about this has never been to Vegas and didn't do their homework. No matter what hotel you stay at in Las Vegas you pay extra for higher floors, views, suites. Smoking/non smoking and King/ 2 doubles are NOT guarranteed at most properties. They will try to accomodate you. When they tell you they do not have a King bed available and try to upsell you a different room...they are NOT trying to rip you off, the other room DOES cost more. I read many reports up here complaining that they paid for an upgrade and think they were ripped off. Strip view? yup, that costs more. Refurbished room? yes, that costs more...put them together and it costs even more. DO your homework before you go. Ate at the buffet was average wouldn't be afraid to eat there again. Like many properties in Vegas when you are in the lobby area and a stranger asks you how long are you in town? or Where are you from? ....these are timeshare hawkers and will entice you with free show tickets in exchange for sitting through hours of a sales pitch to buy a timeshare. It is up to you if you want to do this or think (like myself ) that it is a waste of time. Just giving you a heads up. Piano Bar in the front of the property was great to watch and listen to.

The room overlooked the pool which was ok. The big thing here was just how tiny the room was. I was very disappointed in that.

This was my first time staying at Harrah's and my 4th trip to Vegas with my 18.5 month old. Things that were great about Harrah's: -Location, location, location! It was very central to the places I wanted to visit (Forum Shops at Caesar's and Canal Shoppes at Venetian were both nice places to go with my toddler; both were within close walking distance) -The breakfast buffet was more expensive than I expected, but had food that was of much better quality that I expected---I would recommend it even for the price! -The KGB (Kerry's Gourmet Burger's) was amazing! They had these sweet potato tots that were yummy!! My hubby and I went for lunch while my mom watched my daughter. -We got upgraded to minisuites, which was a pleasant surprise. We got 2 rooms (1 for me, my hubby, and my daughter and 1 for my mom). We may have gotten this because both me and my hubby are Total Rewards members (players club). Although neither or us are huge gamblers, I guess the frequency of out visits helped us out in this case. Oddly, they gave my mom the bigger room of the 2 even though she was alone. -Check in was easy and quick (not always the case in my experience with other Vegas hotels) -Staff was very nice -We got to do a free spin on a slot machine in the Carnival Court because we are Total Rewards members; my hubby won $20 in dining credit while me and my mom got free T-shirts (the minimum prize) -The room rates were very good considering the location. Things I did not like abotu Harrah's: -There is NO WIFI in the rooms! There is a cable to connect to the high speed internet (for a fee), but it's next to the bed, not next to the table! -The casino was very smokey, likely due to the low ceilings. -The rooms are very basic, even our \"mini-suite\" didn't feel luxurious, but clean. -There was no light over the shower, so it was pretty dark when we pulled the curtain to use the shower. -The pool area was too small for the size of the hotel -There was no kiddie pool Just an FYI---some Vegas hotels DO NOT allow you to push STROLLERS in their lobby; I have seen signs outside of some of the fancier hotels stating that they do not allow stroller use because they are concerned for the enjoyment of their guests (i.e., guests without kids).

The check-in process took quite awhile due to a reservation mistake - they did not have us as coming in on the 20th. After several phone calls the issue was resolved, and it did not help matters that I did not remember to take our confirmation number. We were assigned Room CC1817 and the accommodations are adequate for an older facility. I had taken several pieces of jewelry and had my items in a holder with several compartments located in the bathroom on top of the counter. While my jewelry is not precious stones, it is relatively new high fashion jewels, and I liked what I had. I left the pouch in the bathroom while we were gone, and it was zippered shut. The towels were changed daily while we were away. When I got home I realized I had left my computer cord in the room, and after unpacking my jewelry sets, I realized several pieces were missing. I called Harrah's and left a voice mail with the Security Lost and Found about the articles that were missing. They called back a day later to inform me that no items had been turned into their office and that they were sorry to hear I had a loss. Be sure and put all of your valuables in the safe! My jewelry did not walk out of that room on its own. I hand carried my jewelry on and off the airplane, therefore, it had to have been taken from our hotel room. I suspect it was a person from housekeeping or other staff member with a key card that helped themseleves to some nice pieces of jewelry. I would stay at Harrah's again, but I would make sure to utilize the safe!

I booked at Harrah's in Las Vegas because I had stayed there in the past, but it had been at least 10 years. The location is the selling point. Being centrally located on the strip is great. It's easily within walking distance of Ceasar's Palace, The Venetian, Mirage, Treasure Island, Bally's, Flaminingo and The Bellagio. The Carnaval Court Bar outside of Harrah's is always a party with live music which what seems to be around the clock. Here is the problem: We stayed in the Mardi Gra Tower. Upon entering our room, I noticed a not-so-normal looking thermostat for the air conditioner with a sign below it. The sign stated basically that in order to conserve the earth's resources, the air conditioner is set to go off when no one is in the room, and then return to normal operations when someone returns to the room. WRONG!!! All it is is a motion sensor on a thermostat. When you leave your room for more than 5 minutes, the air conditioner shuts off until it detects movement inside the room. Then the air conditioner comes back on until it again detects no movement. It all sounds great, right? Well, when you go to bed, if you don't move for more than 5 minutes, the air conditioner shuts off. It doesn't take long in the Vegas heat for the room to heat up. So, you must wave your arm, kick your leg up, or actually get up and move around for the air conditioner to come back on.. We got very little sleep in the 3 nights that we spent here, which made for a really long trip to Vegas. We had friends/family that stayed right next door to us at Imperial Palace that said their room was great AND the A/C stayed on all night. Imperial Palace is always cheaper than Harrah's.

This was our second time staying in this hotel after a successful stay in 2007 - liking the location, the value, and the security. This stay, however, proved in so many ways that Harrah's has cut back on their security (and openly admitted it). You need to be aware of this before you make a decision to stay there. After arriving Tuesday afternoon, we were gone all day on Wednesday out sight-seeing and shopping. We left our \"do not disturb\" tag out because we didn't need any fresh linens or our room cleaned. When we returned, my husband immediately went to charge his phone but the charger was missing. After looking around for a couple of seconds he then started looking for money he hid in his suitcase. Our safe was closed upon arrival and he didn't want to carry around extra cash so he hid it between business papers in his suitcase. It was gone. I then noticed that my suitcase had been gone through - nothing missing though. So we were missing a phone charger and money. The first thing we did was call hotel security and they were in our room within 15 minutes. We had to fill out an incident report. We were then told several disturbing things during our conversation with security. We asked how fast it would be before getting footage from the hallway cameras and we were told that Harrahs has NO HALLWAY CAMERAS. We then asked why there wasn't a security officer down by the elevators checking hotel keys/IDs like there was the last time we stayed there. We were told that because of the economy/cuts in staff, they eliminated those positions and security officers walk up and down the hallways every couple of hours or so. Great! So all criminals in Las Vegas know this! We asked about a key entry because housekeeping was right across the hall when we left and our \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign was hanging from our door. He said that he would run our door and see if there was an extra key entry. We haven\u2019t heard anything yet. The security guard checked our door and discovered it didn\u2019t quite close all the way on its own. Well, we had been tugging at it when we left, but there could have been that \u201cone time\u201d that we didn\u2019t. Either way \u2013 doors should be properly maintenanced so this doesn\u2019t happen because apparently there are \u201cdoor pushers\u201d who walk up and down the hallways \u201cpushing\u201d on doors to see if they will open. I expressed my concern about not feeling safe in the room so the security guard talked to the manager on duty and we were moved to a suite (which wasn\u2019t a suite at all, just a little bit bigger regular room). When we went down to switch out our keys we talked to the manager about the lack of security and he told us that it was ILLEGAL to have video cameras in the hallway. What? Then why do the Mirage, Caesars, Bellagio\u2026 all have security cameras in their hallways? I will no longer stay in a hotel without security cameras in the hallways. Sounds to me like the criminals (or housekeeping) have caught on since the last few posts on here are about theft. Seems like a bunch of us should get together and file a class action suit against Harrahs for their lack of security and knowledge that it is a problem.", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guelph, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel in Las Vegas!!\u201d", "Author": "chickieboo", "ReviewID": "UR106369685", "Content": "We have stayed at Harrah's Casino in Las Vegas since 1985 and love that place!!

I told him the story and he said \"that's unacceptable, what do you want me to do\"? I said you can start by giving me new sheets! That is all that was said. I figured at the least they would send me a apology message or give me a free dinner or something. I went to check out the next day. The check-out lady was so rude to me for no reason and told me there was no shuttle service going to airport (I found out later there was and took it). After that I brought up the incident of my dirty bedding. The manager came over and I explained to him what happened and how disgusting it was. He asked me why I never saw it the 3 days before.

The last time was in July 2010 having an upgraded room free to the Carnaval Towers with a strip view (Mirage Volcano can be seen). Most recently got a $50 upgrade to an Executive Suite to the Carnaval Tower. Although some people may say Harrah's is worn down, needs update, etc., the value is exceptional with good service, great location, and comfortable rooms. The suite was amazing with the view of the airport and canyons of Vegas. Bathroom was large with a whirlpool tub, shower, and two sinks. Bedroom was large, which could have fit a walk in closet rather than a small closet for clothes. Bed was comfortable with this pillow I wanted to take home cause it rested my next wonderfully. Living room had a bar with sink and fridge, but wished it had a microwave. The living room also had a sofa bed, which could hold a few more people in the room. The only issue with having a room facing the airport is that you can hear the planes take off up to 2 am in the morning. However, it was not an issue since most of your time spent in Vegas is being up all night. The casino floor had two new slots, Wheel of Fortune and American Idol, which was loose in bonus rounds, but better winnings in Imperial Palace next door. As always, Flavors buffet is a good deal, but wished they didn't use powdered eggs, but real eggs for breakfast. Service is flawless with smiles and hello's from all the employees. Although Vegas can take all your money, in the end you take home an amazing time that will always want you to come back and visit the monies you left behind.

When I asked the operator if she could put a note on my reservation, I was told \"no, only the front desk can do that, and they never answer the phone\". Wow... At check-in, the front desk agent was very pleasant and efficient, however only my friend's name was on the reservation, my name was not requested. If there were any sort of incident in the hotel, I shudder to think of how difficult it would be for the front office team to determine which guests were registered in their guest rooms. On arrival, I called housekeeping to request foam pillows, my name and room number was not confirmed, and I received a grunt in response to the request, which made me wonder if it had been acknowledged. However, when I returned, the foam pillows were on the bed. Staff cutbacks are obvious, especially in housekeeping; The corridors were not vacuumed regularly, the elevator was not well-maintained or vacuumed, and the guestroom bathrooms were adequate at best, with the corners of the sink \"gunky\", the showerhead dirty, and the glasses dirty. The positives of this hotel are comfortable beds, price and location, however this is my second poor experience with a Harrah's property and I will not be booking with the chain again.

The beds were clean and comfortable, the bathroom stocked but simple. The tv was a holdover from days of bell-bottoms and shag carpet but it worked. I didn't even know they still made giant 27\" Zenith tvs. My only real room complaint was the air conditioning. If I understand correctly, in order to conserve energy, the a/c goes into a standby mode when it doesn't detect motion in the room. I didn't notice any problem with this while sleeping, but when I would return to my room after being out for the day it was very stuffy. It didn't take long to cool off and lose the stale odor but my first whiff of the room after being on the casino floor wasn't a good one. My lower service rating is based on the lack of modern wireless internet in the rooms. $13/day for a (slow) wired connection is unacceptable in a modern hotel. The housekeeping staff were all very friendly as I passed them in the hallway and never disturbed me as long as my \"do not disturb\" sign was out. If they saw me leaving the room they would typically greet me and politely ask if I needed anything - towels, sheets, soap - which I found very inviting. Desk staff and cashiers were equally as polite even when delivering the canned \"Welcome\" responses. I would recommend the Spa to anyone interested. It's not the cheapest and most likely not the most luxurious, but it was well worth the visit.

It was smaller than the rooms I had stayed in before, but were clean and perfectly functional. 2 recomendations I have for anyone staying at this property or visiting Vegas. On our first night we purchased at Tix 4 Tonite reduced priced tickets for the American Superstars show at Harrahs, and 50% off entree coupon for the steakhouse at Harrahs called The Range. This was an absolute steal on both ends. The show is a impersonator/tribute show that included Liberace, Rod Stewart, Marilyn Monroe, and Michael Jackson. It was very entertaining and was only $35/person. I would much rather see this for $35 than a Cirque Show for $100. After the show, we had dinner at the Range. This was the 3rd time I have eaten there and it didn't disappoint. My wife and I both had the Filet and 4 oz lobster tail. Both were very good. We split the Onion Soup and Ceasar Salad. Soup was great, but was not a fan of the anchovies on the salad. Overall, I feel the property is a value, and has a perfect location. If you are one of those on here who expects your room to be like Bellagio, Wynn, or Venetian, but pay $100 or less/night for your room, then Harrahs is not for you.

I've had a view room before and I don't need to see the strip anymore. I just need a comfortable bed in a safe space and Harrah's had both of these.

I've even met rats that have moved out mumbling something about \"It's gone downhill lately......\" Harrah's has pretty much everything you want from a Vegas hotel. The casino is a good size with a wide enough variety of machines. The cocktails come fast, come strong and come often. The Buffet is a little on the pricey side but still worth a trip....... only the once though. It has the fitness centre and business centre that you'll walk by and never use (it's Vegas...... i mean who wants to be sending a fax??) The Monorail is out the back should you wish to use it and generally the check in speed is up there with the best and the lifts work well (take note Imperial Palace. Waiting 20 minutes for an lift might put your paying guests in a bit of a bad mood....... except if it was a lift like the one in Willy Wonka's factory... i'd wait an hour for that one). All in all then, a good hotel for your first trip to Vegas, easy to get around for the physically challenged and good value for money..... however... A hotel is only as good as the quality of sleep you can have there, and on this score i'm afraid to say Harrah's is terrible! If it's not the bar downstairs blasting away until the early hours it's the group of 30 students who've decided to have a party in the room next door (seriously, this happened every night for a week.... with different people too..... you're in Vegas and you decide to have a party in your room?

Harrah\u2019s also has a shuttle to its' sister hotel Rio, which was helpful (and free) for taking in Penn and Teller. The hotel also has 2 Starbucks on both the first and second level, and numerous restaurants, including KGB, which served up some of the best burgers in Vegas! Once staying there, do sign up for their Total Rewards program, which can be used at the any of the hotel casinos in the chain, including Harrah\u2019s, Rio, Caesar\u2019s Palace, Paris, Bally\u2019s, Flamingo, Bill\u2019s Gamblin\u2019 Hall, Imperial Palace, O\u2019Sheas and Planet Hollywood, to earn points and redeem for various comps. The room itself was average but clean. We had booked a King bedroom but when we arrived, we were told that the hotel was fully booked and as a result, would have to sleep in a room with two queen beds, with the promise that the next day we would be switched to another room with the King sized bed. As it turned out, we were comfortable in our room, and decided not to switch rooms again (even though we the hotel delivered on their promise). Also, we ended up ordering a mini fridge, as one was not provided in the room. It came at an additional cost of $15 per night. Overall, our interactions with the staff were pleasant and I would say that we had an enjoyable stay at the hotel. Harrah\u2019s is definitely somewhere I would recommend for anyone wishing to visit Las Vegas, due to its location, great prices and convenience for getting around.", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auburn", "Title": "\u201cUsed to be the best - Tahoe - can not believe it was the same place in Vegas!\u201d", "Author": "MtShasta40", "ReviewID": "UR93412137", "Content": "From the time we checked in - all went wrong.

But we called, they came and picked up the left over food from previous \"guests\" - then later we found even more left over food in the Not really refrigerator. Then, I purchased some wine from your gift shop - but of course had to purchase a wine opener. Well it broke off in the cork - I took it back to the gift shop - they said there was nothing they could do - so I asked for a manager - they (yes two ladies came) said sorry they could not open it as the gift shop did not have a license - so they game me another bottle of wine - and another opener - and yes it broke also. So back I went, this time asked them to have someone from Plant Operations bring something to open - still could not do it. I asked for a refund, they said ok but only for one bottle of wine and one opener - REALLY? Of course I only wanted one, but it was very insulting and demeaning that they wanted to make that very clear to me. The staff gave me the feeling that I was bothering them. I am an HR Director of a large hospital system in California, I know customer service - and I am sure none of the owners or executives of Harrahs would stand to be treated as we were. To be fair, the lady in the cashier cage was LOVELY, she was very helpful to tell me how to play - etc. She was the only one. Although we are not \"high rollers\", this is not the way to get anyone to become one. Our friends do play a lot and they have said they will never come back to Harrahs. They will go to another \"nice hotel\". Due to my customer service background, I don't feel that is fair without letting those who can do something about this - know what is going on. I feel somewhat responsible for suggesting Harrah's - so that is why I am writing to you. I see from your other comments - I am not alone.

I had reserved a Standard Room, and that's what I got. Room was very nice, plenty large, clean, everything I needed. Beds were very comfortable and there must be some pillow management because I didnt have any pillows with the thickness of a dime. TV picture quality was only so so, but I wasn't there to watch tv. Heat and A.C. seemed a bit tricky to control with their \"go-green\" programs, there were times I would get up to see if I had set it right because it wouldn't do anything and then all of a sudden it would click on. And I do have to agree, the marble floors in the bathroom are a death trap. I about fell twice, caught myself both times on the counter. What's really nice about this place, that they don't seem to promote is the monorail. It's a great way to get up and down the strip without dealing with the guys flicking those cards at you. It's also the same route to the monorail to get you over to Imperial Palace so you can avoid their little mall between the two. Common areas very clean, they make internet very accessible even if you don't have a laptop, and of course - because you have to walk through it I'll mention it - not smoky on the casino floor at all.

Went to the buffet on Christmas, stood in a long line, paid $54 for what was INDEED the WORST meal I have ever eaten. No steak, just rare prime rib, and I had to request that my almost RAW prime rib be thrown on the grill because I despise anything that isn't cooked well. One guy refused to put the prime rib on the grill but thanks to Teodoro, I was at least able to consume something worth the half hour wait Salvatore, you can go kick rocks, your attitude was HORRID! Most of the wait staff were friendly, but serving school cafeteria spaghetti at a buffet that costs $24.99 per person plus tax is a DEALBREAKER. Oh, and you guessed it, I couldn't use the crappy coupon that they gave me. I'd say to anyone planning a trip, do your research, a lot of the low budget hotels have better amenities than the hotels on the strip, and of course they're (strip hotels) collecting so much money that they could care less, but guess what, little things count when it comes to service, and charging people for refrigerators when the other hotels offer them for free is just bad business. Businesses aren't going out of business because of the recession, they're going out of business because most human beings are tired of paying money and being treated like garbage. Did I forget to mention the ancient televisions. I had to go to the sports bar down the street to watch the game because the tv is terrible.

Almost everything was open for Christmas with the exception of the Carnival Court. You would never even know it was Christmas day there. Nothing shuts down. Diamond check in was a breeze and we were upgraded to a jr. suite on 27th of Carnival Tower. Huge room but bathroom was small and not one of the upgraded granite counter tops you may read about in the room descriptions. Room was very quiet and comfortable. It had a coffee pot, but I have read other reviews that they don't have them in most rooms. I had packed a little coffee pot that I got at a walgreens for $10 and brought my own coffee and condiments. The valet parking was as fast and smooth as it could be. For being Christmas, the streets were absolutely jam packed with people of all kinds. If this is your first time to vegas, BEWARE THE SLAPPERS! There are these peddler type people on the street trying to force hand bills into your hands. These people should be arrested. They block the flow of the already congested sidewalks and cause little bottle necks of chaos. IGNORE THEM, do not accept their junk and just keep walking. We took the Deuce down to Freemont Street and arrived with no problem, getting back to Harrahs was a joke. It is too far to walk but the bus was crawling in the really log jammed traffic. It was total gridlock. We finally gave up and got out and walked. Harrah's Flavors buffet is good, but their sister property Planet Hollywood has the Spice Market Buffet and it beats Flavors, but not by too much. Christmas day Dinner, oh my god, the lines (being a Total Rewards Diamond Player has its rewards). I felt so bad for all those people standing on line for hours! Literally. Diamond has its own private entrance and no wait (yes, I felt guilty, but not too guilty to eat-lol). Casino floor service was very good. Always had a cocktail waitress around when we wanted one and they never forget to come back as long as you tip them. The room was not the reason we came to Vegas, but I have to agree with some of the other reviews that the rooms that don't have the flat screen tvs are a little dated in many ways. The elevators are quite fast and the other guests did seem to respect the other guests. We hardly heard a sound from the hallway. A couple of tips I have learned from traveling a lot, take a safety pin to close the drapes better. Bring a small plug in night light for the bathroom to find your way in the dark, and bring a small extension cord to plug your phone chargers into so you don't have to fight to get to the plug behind the bed. Also, we used Tickets 4 Today located at the far end of the Casino Royale (next door to Harrahs\") The show tix are way discounted and a real bargain.

Took a cab from the airport which only cost $15 for the two of us. Arrived at 4 p.m. expecting a long check-in but took less than 5 minutes. Got nabbed by Wyndam Resorts before we even got to the elevators. Very nice people offered us 4 two for one buffet coupons and $125 in eating vouchers at any of the Harrah's properties or a 3 day cruise if we would listen to 2 hour presentation. We chose the eating and scheduled our presentation for 9 a.m. the next morning. Our room in the Carnival Tower was very clean, quiet, and comfortable. Couldn't believe how fast the elevators were. That evening we used the $5 we each got signing up for Total Rewards at the poker machine and turned it into $39--can't believe how lucky we were. After that we just walked the strip and checked things out. Free breakfast before our presentation the next day. The Wyndam property was beautiful but we said NO. Got our money vouchers and coupons. Went to the Mac King afternoon show which was very good--had free coupon from check-in but had to buy a $10 drink which was a nice perk. Went to the Improv that night which was pretty good but I liked Mac King better. The next day we took the express shuttle to the outlet mall so my wife could shop. For $7 you can get an unlimited 24 hour pass on the duece or express busses that travel the strip. That night we went to Ka at MGM. That was an extravagant show and I'm glad we saw it. The next morning we checked out the Cosmopolitan in the morning which had just opened the night before and then checked out of our room (less than 5 minutes) and still had time on our bus pass so took the bus to the south transfer station and then took the 109 bus to the airport. We thought Flavors Buffet was great. We had a good time eating--it was really a challenge to use up the coupons and eating vouchers that we had.

We had 3 nights, Saturday to Tuesday, in what was supposed to be a Luxury room with a view of the Strip - according to the Expedia site I booked with, but our view was of the car park and the other wing, so I suspect the hotel put us in a Classic room. I didn't pick this up until I started to write this review, so it's my fault for not querying it with the hotel at the time. And to be honest, it's very true what everyone says - your room is definitely only a place to catch up on some sleep in between being amazed at all there is to see and do in Vegas, so the view doesn't really matter! Our room was clean and comfortable. One of the net curtains had started to come off it's track, which I though might have been noticed by housekeeping but that is a minor point. Not having tea or coffee making facilities in the room was inconvenient. Coming from New Zealand, this is the norm in hotels 'down-under' and we found it strange that we couldn't even request an electric jug from housekeeping - they simply don't have them. I guess it's all part of getting you to pay for as much as possible and may be standard in all Las Vegas hotels - don't know about that. The hotel is definitely one of the older properties, and can't match the glitz and glam of the newer hotels, but what it lacks in 'bells and whistle's', it makes up for with its location - right smack bang in the middle of all the action - across the road from Caesars and the Mirage. We loved Vegas - but 3 nts is definitely not long enough. Granted I had to slow my pace to match Mum's, but even if I had been able to race around at my usual pace, I think 5 nts is the minimum required, and a week would be great - especially if also wanting to visit the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam. We didn't have time for this.

The only bad thing about this hotel was the Check in (45 min of run around). It was the worst experience of any hotel I have ever gone to. After 11 hours of planes, automobiles and time changes all we wanted to do was get in our room and relax. We stood in the check in line for about 5min, our room with a king bed was not ready so we opted for any avail room and took 2 queen, got our key card and dragged our luggage toward the elevator and were immediately harassed by hotel staff trying to get us to go to one of their time share properties. After another 10min of saying NO we got up to the 25th floor - found our room, put the card in the door...NOTHING..tried again..NOTHING, door would not open. Got all our bags went back down to the lobby, stood IN LINE again, got a different girl. We explained the problem with the card. She took the card \"fixed\" it and we made our way back to the elevator again harassed by the time share agent, back up to the 25th floor. Put the card in the door...NOTHING. Got all our gear and suitcases and now visibly irritated STOOD IN LINE again. Got yet a different agent. We refused to take the card back and just asked for a different room. She moved us down the hall..no apology. Once we got in our new room we only had a couple hiccups...the toilet handle kept sticking - causing the toilet to run constantly, flipping the handle fixed it. We also found there to be no sound barrier with adjoining rooms(door particularly). We could hear the couple next door as clear as a bell with a regular conversation. i would hate to get stuck beside a room with partiers you would be up all night. The Hotel was in a perfect location right in the heart of the strip, rooms were nice. The beds were supper comfy and it had a perfect view of the mountains. The pictures of the rooms on their website must be from years ago...they are much nicer then the picture. We did come back up to our room at 12:30 in the morning to find a poor guy trying to get into the old room we had accompanied by a security guard breaking into the room because his card wouldn't work either. The casino waitresses don't make you wait long for a drink either. We had a great time. We only paid $96us for 3 nights. If you search their website you will usually find a promo code 15%-25% off your stay our original price was $117. Great value,great beds, great location. Even with the hiccups it's still the top of my list and I will be going back. Get a rewards card, and use it. You will more then likely get a free hotel room on your next visit.

Check-in: We arrived in the early evening - there were 4 folks in front of us and the line-up moved quickly. The interaction was pleasant and we were soon headed upstairs. 2. Room: We received the room I had requested when booking \u2013 two queen beds, non-smoking room, and a quiet location. Room 2943 overlooks part of the strip and we had a perfect view of the Mirage and their volcano which my daughter enjoyed watching each night. The room itself was clean, a nice size with a small table and two chairs by the window, and the beds were comfy with lots of pillows and puffy white comforters. We could hear folks around us once in a while (in the hallway or adjoining room) but overall the room was very quiet which was perfect for my teen who likes to sleep in whenever possible. I had booked a Luxury room through Expedia for $62.73 a night CAN (no resort fee) and it was well worth the minimal extra cost. There was also a coffee maker in the room which was a lovely to have in the mornings so I could have some caffeine while waiting for the teen to roll out. The A/C was hit and miss but when the room warmed up too much, we\u2019d just open the window and let in some fresh, cool air from outside. 3. Harrah\u2019s restaurants: We tried the Flavors buffet on our first morning in Vegas. The service was great \u2013 I was given a carafe of coffee and lots of creamers and my daughter\u2019s chocolate milk was good. The food itself was basic buffet breakfast fare and was tasty. There are two Starbucks in the hotel\u2013 the one on the main level was always open and I grabbed a few latte\u2019s from there during the week. On our last evening we treated ourselves to the from-scratch homemade ice cream at IcePan on the second level and it was delicious. We both tried the non-fat ice cream and it was excellent. 4. Room attendants: The ladies who worked on our floor were very nice \u2013 every time we saw them in the morning, they were smiling and pleasant and we exchanged a \u201cgood morning\u201d. Our room was kept clean and restocked as required. 5. Location: Excellent! So many great hotels are within walking distance \u2013 the Mirage, TI, Venetian, Caesar\u2019s Palace, Flamingo, Paris, Bally\u2019s, Bellagio, etc. The shows we\u2019d booked were all within walking distance \u2013 the only time we needed transportation was for shopping and the attractions that are farther down the strip. 6. Getting around: We were in Vegas to shop (and go to shows) so on Day 1 we each bought a $20 3-Day All Access bus Pass (Premium Service) that included the Deuce bus (goes up and down the strip) and the Gold Line bus (which goes to both outlet malls and Freemont). Excellent purchase for getting us to the locations that were outside of walking distance. We checked out the RTC website in advance and knew which bus stops were closest to Harrah\u2019s for each bus. We also ended up using the monorail twice because it was the quickest route to get us from Harrah\u2019s to MGM. It\u2019s nice to use but you have to walk all the way to the back of each hotel in order to use the monorail where the buses stop right out on the strip. The Deuce is the double-decker and it\u2019s a lot of fun to sit up top and check out the sites as you\u2019re traveling. And you will definitely use the bus pass if you\u2019re there for a few days and the Bellagio seems a lot further than it did on Day 1 because your feet are giving out on you. One warning though \u2013 the Deuce fills right up to capacity when Vegas is hopping and sometimes it can be hard to get on and it seems like forever (ie. 20 \u2013 30 minutes) until the next bus comes along. And the evenings can be cooooold - especially if it's windy. 7. Shows: We saw Mystere, Blue Man Group, and Terry Faytor and loved them all. We\u2019d go back to each one. Mystere wasn\u2019t full and one of the ushers asked us if we\u2019d like to sit in the front row \u2013 which of course we accepted. The show has lots of \u201cwow\u201d moments and is quite funny. Blue Man Group was also funny and we were in the 2nd row. The first 4 or 5 rows are poncho rows and we were happy to be sitting off to the side a bit as we didn\u2019t really need the poncho (although it was nice to have just in case as folks in the middle did need theirs). Terry Faytor has an excellent voice and we enjoyed the selection of music he used in his act. 8. Attractions: There is currently a deal where you can pay one price ($54 each) and you can pick three attractions to go and see. We chose the Titanic exhibit (Luxor), the Bodies exhibit (Luxor right beside the Titanic exhibit), and the CSI experience (MGM). The Titanic exhibit was amazing \u2013 it was goose-bump-raising to see items from the ship and the presentation was more than I expected with a walk through third class, the higher classes, the winding staircase, and information about the passengers. We thought the Bodies exhibit was very interesting but it\u2019s probably not for everyone as it is genuine cadavers that have been peeled and posed to show different parts of the body (ie. nervous system, muscle structure, bones, etc). The CSI Experience at MGM was a lot of fun \u2013 you get to choose 1 of 3 mysteries and have to search for the facts to solve your case. We used the monorail to get from Harrah\u2019s to MGM as the monorail stop at MGM is right next to the CSI Experience. We also went to Madame Tussaud\u2019s wax museum at the Venetian which was excellent as usual. We were going back and forth about whether we wanted to see it but then a gentleman out front gave us a coupon for $8 off of each of our tickets so we decided to go in. We didn\u2019t regret it as they\u2019ve added quite a few new wax figures since my last visit in 2008. 9. Other restaurants/buffets: Our favourite restaurant this trip was definitely the Rainforest Caf\u00e9 in MGM. This place is great for children and adults \u2013 great food/value plus there are animatronic animals that move around, lots of big fish, and a thunderstorm each hour. I had a burger and my daughter had a salad and both were excellent. Least favourite meal of the trip was the lunch buffet at the Luxor \u2013 the service was excellent but the food was cafeteria-style at best and wasn\u2019t very good. Favourite buffet that we tried was definitely the lunch buffet at Treasure Island.

My conference was at the Venetian Hotel, priced at $259 per night. Since I was staying for the whole week I decided to stay somewhere less expensive. I got a 'luxury room' for an average price of $80 per night. Check in was fine, there was a long line but I got in my room within 20 minutes, the person doing the checkin was very helpful and tried to accomodate a couple of things I requested, no luck on the requests but she did try. The luxury room (strip view) apparently hadn't been upgraded so they moved me into a room in the Mardis Gras tower which had a pool view but no strip view. The room was fine, clean and comfortable. I had an air conditioner issue the first night but it was immediately addressed. Later in the week I had a need for a roll away bed and extra towels, these were provided very quickly by a very pleasant gentleman. Very easy to get to the Venetian conference area from there, took me 10 minutes to walk it from my room to the conference center. I had breakfast in the restaurant, food and service was fine. Dinner one night in the gourmet hamburger place was not so good, I do not recommend the Captain Crunch milkshake, alright, I know I probably should have known better but the kid in me spoke loudly. The hamburger was overdone, all in all not a good meal. Gambling at the Casino... didn't really try it there as the smoke was really bad. Other casinos have done a much better job at removing the smoke and creating a pleasant gaming experience. Harrahs needs to do that. Most of the blackjack tables (all that I saw except single deck) were 6:5 payouts which I won't play, you have to work too hard to win (if it is possible to win). So outside a few slots that my wife played there we took our gambling somewhere else. Best places to gamble: Mandalay Bay and MGM, found $5 blackjack tables and played all day. Both places comp'd meals. Dealers were great. As a homebase to wander the strip, at an affordable price, Harrahs is a good value. I would stay there again. All in all great trip to Vegas, food comp'd where we gambled, great show, saw Beatles Love... hint, look for discount ticket codes on line and choose the cheap seats, best seats in the house, 2nd time I have seen the show and I will see it as often as I can.

We were able to watch the erupting volcano at the Mirage from our window every night!!

On our last night however, our neighbors must have had one too many and woke us up when they were trying to get into our room at 3:00 am. We ate breakfast at the Flavours buffet at Harrah's and, although the food was not bad, it was very pricey, (about $33.00 for the two of us). Most days, we ate breakfast at the McDonalds nearby. The birthday celebration dinner was held at Harrah's in the Range Restaurant. Beautiful ambiance and all of our meals were tasty. The service was very good. The pool wasn't the nicest that we've enjoyed but it certainly did the job. It was nice that we were allowed to \"discreetly\" bring our own beverages to the pool. That saved us a lot of $$ as both the drinks and dinners were quite pricey. The choice of music played by the young DJ's failed to target the average age of the crowd.

Customer service is great compared to other casino hotels that I have stayed at. Check in was good - only one slight problem (room requested was not available) but after speaking to the manager, our request was granted (which was great considering it was Labor Day weekend). We received a room on a low floor (as requested) - 6th floor since they are currently renovating the rooms on the 4th and 5th floors. Please note that if you are staying on the 6th floor of the Mardi Gras Tower, please be prepared to hear construction work going on and there is a possibility that your electric will be shut off momentarily. They will not tell you this at check in (slight disappointment). However, before I even got a chance to call the front desk, our electric came back on. This only happened once that I am aware of. Drink service is #1. Server is quick to ask you what you want once you sit at the machine and will constantly come around and ask if you would like another drink. She remembers what you had and will only ask if you would like another drink - does not ask what you will be drinking as she already knows! The only annoying part of casino service is the girl who walks around asking \"cigarettes, cigars\". Her voice reaches a pitch that would make my dog run and hide! But I guess she is good at what she does since she has been there for at least the 3 years that I have visited the hotel! On this trip we decided to visit the Grand Canyon / Hoover Dam and Boneyard (sign museum). I highly recommend taking these tours. The Grand Canyon was awesome - a once in a lifetime experience. Went through Grand Canyon Tour Company - an excellent, knowledgeable and reliable company that picks you up from your hotel and drops you off at the door - no hassles!! The Boneyard was excellent as well - very knowledgeable tour guide as well! Must reserve through email only. If anyone has any questions about these tours, please feel free to contact me! If you are looking to purchase the all day buffet pass, make sure you have a total rewards card. The all day buffet pass costs $39.99 - however if you do not have a total rewards card, it will cost $45.99 and you will have to wear the bracelet for 24 hours. I also think there is a fee should the bracelet get ruined / lost. Again, although this may not be the fanciest of hotels - what it lacks in luster is sure made up in customer service!

Bathroom was kept in good working order (i.e. no slow drains or drips) and no deferred maintenance (unlike some so-called 4 star hotels on the Strip...do you hear me Monte Carlo??).

Also, you can't beat the Monorail station located right at the back of the hotel and the connection to the Imperial Place just steps away.

The night before we left, we were in bed around 1:30am and I was not so happily awoken by our VERY loud neighbors around 4:30am which lasted for about an hour. It sounded like they were literally sitting on the bed with us they were so loud. The casino was comparable with all the others..lots of slots, gaming tables, and SMOKE! The service was fine. This is an older hotel, so keep in mind the casino is not as glamorous as many others. There is a beer/liquor store very close which is nice. If you are planning on drinking at the pool, definitely bring your own (even though they tell you not to, it seemed that as long as you were discrete, this was not a problem).

They came through with the bed, however for the view, not so much. If you turned your head to the left and put it on a 45 degree angle with your left eye closed..... you catch my meaning! The rooms are dated, and ours was clean upon check-in with one exception - we found a towel in one of the dresser draws. Our rooms were cleaned daily with restocked towels and toiletries. The housekeeping staff don't remove anything from the room that is not in the garbage cans - so if you have an empty water bottle on your bedside table, it will still be there after the room is cleaned. Our room had a very easy to use safe, which gave us some peace of mind with regards to passports etc. Our A/C temperature did not move, despite trying to change it several times. In the end we gave up as it was acceptable at 69 degrees. The rooms do have a faint smell of tobacco, despite being in a non-smoking room, on a non-smoking floor! We had a TV in our room which was a very, very old CRT style and the picture was so bad, you could not have any lights on in the room if you wanted to watch it. We also had an iron and ironing board - which came in very handy. The power outlets are old and you need to watch it if you are charging items. The plugs sometimes partially fall out of the outlets and the batteries don't get charged! The remainder of the hotel was reasonably clean, even if a little dated. One thing about Harrahs is it's owned by Wyndham so be prepared if you stay here or any other hotel owned by Wyndham, you will be pestered by timeshare sales men. The first night we were there we were approached 7 times!!! There is a monorail stop at the back of the hotel which is perfect if you want to see other places on the strip - don't think you can walk from one end of the strip to another, you will never do it, there are too many people and disjointed walkways - it will take forever. Check in was fast - under 20 minutes and upon check in we were given books upon books of coupons - these do come in very handy so don't discard them. Check out was also quick and easy. There are no in-room coffee or tea facilities, as there are 2 Starbucks in the hotel which can make things very spendy. There are several restaurants in the hotel. We ate at Flavors buffet which was pretty average as well as KGB Burgers, which was reasonably priced and a little better than average. If you want a big meal at a very, very reasonable price, check out the Hash House A Go Go at the Imperial Palace. It's incredible. All in all, for what we paid, we were happy. It does not have the flash of other hotels in Vegas, but as I say, you don't go on holiday to stay in your room!", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "LOUISIANA", "Title": "\u201cHAD GREAT TIME!\u201d", "Author": "JEWELL10", "ReviewID": "UR73495460", "Content": "THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME FOR MY Fmily and i to vacation in las vegas i was a lot hesitant to book AT THE HARRAHS after reading all the negative reviews we booked three rooms there and all of them were really nice i was pleasantly surprise . all the staff was nice and the rooms were cleaned each day ,check in was not long at all but i have to admit at check in they offered me an upgrade and i ask why should i get an upgrade i paid for nice rooms and thats what i expect, we were on the main strip it was busy all the time with a lot of people but i think its the best location if you dont have a car the walk is a beast!", "Date": "August 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "Title": "\u201cBETTER THAN EXPECTED\u201d", "Author": "BLACKS_BEACH_FAN", "ReviewID": "UR73446964", "Content": "I arrived at Harrah's on July 15th at 5:10 pm. There was an eternal line of other guests waiting to check in but to my surprise the line actually moved more quickly than I thought it would. It still took me 30 minutes to check into the hotel and the gentleman who assisted me wasn't overly friendly or welcoming, but he was competent and fast. The only reason for my stay at Harrah's was a road trip I had planned from Salt Lake City to San Diego. I'd received an email advertisement from the property for slashed room rates and I decided that staying at Harrah's would be less expensive than any area budget motel and serve as a better location to do some quick sight seeing of the Strip Area Attractions. Upon making my reservation I'd chosen the upgraded and more expensive DELUXE room over the more basic CLASSIC room. Both seemed fairly similar from the website photos but the DELUXE room also included a TV in the bathroom. (I never even turned it on though, so I'm not certain the upgrade was really worth the price.) Since Harrah's is an older property and based on some reviews I'd read I didn't have great expectations for my stay. I was pleasantly surprised. I found the room to be very clean and comfortable, and much nicer than any basic hotel room. The furnishings were upgraded, there was a nice flat screen TV and spacious wardrobe, and the bathroom was also nicer than I'd expected. The bed was very comfortable and the bedding itself was quite nice. Since I was traveling alone on this occasion I didn't plan to venture into any of the more upscale restaurants in the area. I did grab a quick dinner at the nearby Chipolte restaurant and purchased some breakfast items at the Walgreen's just up the street in the lower level of the Venetian. I was able to catch the volcano show across the street at the Mirage, do some shopping at the Forum Shops, and view 3 of the Fountain shows at the Bellagio. Staying at Harrah's made it very convenient to access these other attractions with ease. In my travels from my room through the hotel and casino property it was noticeable that the other guests were younger and more lively than some of the other Las Vegas Casino Hotels that I'd previously stayed in. That was nice though, it seemed that everyone around me was having fun. There was a little noise in the hallway outside my room that was noticeable, but once I went to sleep I was never awakened or disturbed. I was also impressed by the quality of the amenities in the room. Gilcrest & Soames Shampoo, Lotion and soap. These are Standard at The Mirage and Treasure Island but I really didn't expect them at Harrah's. The soap was some of the best I've ever seen in a hotel property. When I stay at any Las Vegas Strip Hotel, I always Google Map the parking area rear entrance so I can avoid driving on the Strip at all cost. I found it very easy to get to the parking terrace through Koval Lane, and it made my departure out much easier the next morning. A future stay at Harrah's is something I would definitely consider. I didn't have high expectations or demands going in and I found the property to be better than expected.", "Date": "August 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cBoring, Old, Crowded, Outdated Games, Dark, Poor Service\u201d", "Author": "driftnup", "ReviewID": "UR72909387", "Content": "Harrah's Las Vegas use to be a very nice place to visit.

This is probably one of the best reasons to stay here. Rooms are basic. Somehow we got \"upgraded\" to the room with the coffee pot and tv in the bathroom in the mardi gras tower while the friends we were traveling with had the bare basic rooms in the carnival tower. I really don't know how much of a difference this made to us as we did not use either feature, but still it was fun to brag- hey we have a tv in the bathroom. The room was clean and maid service did a good job each day. They do leave a little envelop for tips and at the end of our stay we did put a little money in there. Staff was friendly and check in and out went quickly. Staff was able to answer questions we had and quickly fix the one problem we had- one of the redemption machines ate a voucher without giving my boyfriend the money on it. We really didn't win money while playing slots here - maybe a few odd dollars, but wait staff did circle the machines and offer drinks even when we were playing on the penny slots. We ate at the buffet here twice (dinner and breakfast) and both times it was good. I highly recommend getting the buffet of buffet deal . you pay about 40 bucks and get unlimited access to several buffets for 24 hours. I know this may seem gluttonous but if you eat 4 meals (you do not have to overindulge) it is about 10 bucks a meal and in vegas that is a good deal. If you are a beer drinker and do not care about what kind of beer you drink - the place next door had dollar beers and also dollar margaritas if that is more your style. Not a far walk at all for cheap drinks. We did go to the pool one day for an hour or so. The pool is not much to look at and really pretty plain, so if you are wanting a place with a great pool you may want to go elsewhere, but this was no big deal for us. Over all I was pleased with this hotel as a place to stay. I would also venture to say that the friends we traveled with (8 of us) enjoyed their stay here.

I had read the TA reviews and initially had reserved at Caesar's Palace for the same promotion, but for a higher overall rate. After reading the reviews I decided it was worth saving the $100+ by staying at Harrah's. The hotel was pretty standard - the casino was not overly smoky, the staff was very friendly, our room was spotless, very comfortabale mattress, fresh clean bedding,, with two flat-screen tvs, one in bathroom! Bathroom was spotless as well, with \"upscale\" toiletries. The center-strip location was Harrah's best feature; although, every day and nite there were extremely seedy men and women handing out flyers \"girl for you in your room in 20 minutes\"! I didn't see these people in front of any other center Strip hotel, and wondered why Harrah's allows them there. All I could think of was first amendment right - tt was a public sidewalk. I considered complaining to the management, but blew it off. We spent our days hiking in Red Rock Canyon, Mt. Charleston, and even drove 2.5 hours to Zion National Park in Utah!

We upgraded to a \"luxury\" room; which was far from luxury. It was standard at best. The walls were so thin you could hear the neighbor on each side talking, showering and flushing the comode. Our room was cleaned each day but we had to ask for for fresh towels and to refresh the coffee each day. Additionally, the mini bar, if you could call it that, was not even furnished and a note placed in the mini fridge not to use for personal items and that housekeeping would remove any personal items left daily. Although we did have a view of the pool and side view of the strip, the nightlife from the court between properties wasopen till 2 or 3 am making getting any quality rest impossible. The food in was average at best, prices high, and gaming action limited. Most of the Blackjack action was the 6/5 payoff which favors the house even more. I found the slots to be very tight and did not win there, although we did have some luck at other Harrahs properties.

As so many of the previous reviewers have noted, the room we booked was not available and we were offered an upgrade......perhaps THAT's the reason they keep you in line for so long, to get you to the point that you'd pay anything to get to a room?

Handy tip for us British people, when asking for a cup of tea, ask for hot tea, as otherwise some places will serve you iced tea! Go to the piano bar one night at harrah's it was a good laugh.

We got there Thursday night and waited about 30 mins to check in. I had requested one king size bed and they said they were out of nonsmoking rooms with king size beds that night so they offered to upgrade us that night but then we would have to switch rooms the next day. I chose the room with 2 queen size beds because it would have been an inconvenience and a queen isn't that big of a deal versus king. I also requested a 'quiet' room, aka a room not facing the Carnival outside bar. The room was surprisingly nice. Nothing fancy but it was clean and had the basic essentials (bed, ironing board, hair dryer, etc.) Viewing some of these reviews I thought it would be a dirt pit but it was actually really clean, thank goodness! Our view was of the side of the Venetian but also we had a crystal clear view of the Mirage volcano which was pretty cool. The Carnival bar outside was super crowded and there was a very long line to get in, so we just got yard drinks (I think that's what they're called) for $27 each. Quite expensive but they put at least 1/3 - 1/2 bottle of Morgan in each one! It seemed like most of the drinks in Vegas were around $10 and that was just a regular drink, nothing special, so I thought the yard drinks were a much better deal for the amt of alcohol put in. I had one drink for the whole night basically. Unfortunately you could hear other people's toilets flushing/showers running or people in the hallway but half the time we were in the room we were sleeping and the fan would be on to drown it out.

Our upgraded and remodeled room had stains on the carpet, a big crack in the tub and what looked like tread marks on the walls - maybe somebody was bored and trying to run up the walls? Who knows! Another fun part was that we were told we were in the Mardi Gras Tower BUT if you are in that tower on floors 5 or 6 they have a sign posted that you have to use the elevators for the other tower to get to your room.

Then went back to sleep. When they woke up at 7 am the next morning, their wallets, and cell phones were GONE. Sometime between the alarm going off and 7 am when they woke up someone had entered their room. All 3 wallets and 2 of their cell phones had been stolen...one cell phone was on the floor and not visible. All their credit cards, cash and photo id's were gone. We notified hotel security, who came up to take the report....who told us this was rare. Dont believe you!!!! As the process moved along it became clear that they were not going to accept any liability in this matter and that they were blaming the boys for not using the deadbolt latch. They even went as far as to accuse them of leaving the door ajar. Which by the way is impossible even if you let the door shut from one inch away it closes securely and locks. They were asked why they didnt use the safe.....DUH Because they were IN THE ROOM!! About an hour and 1/2 later a security guard found 2 of the 3 wallets in a trash can on the first floor...of course emptied of the important stuff. Proof that someone had taken and disposed of them. We needed to file an official police report so that the boys could have proof that their id's had been stolen in order to get back on the plane to come home. We were then sent on a wild goose chase to a Las Vegas Police substation. It cost us $60 to get there and when we did IT WAS CLOSED!! Then we had to go to the airport to file the police report. Finally we found the police to make the report. The police there told us that this happened all the time. Hmmm I thought it was rare, according to Harrah's Another hour and half of our vacation wasted. By the time they were through with the reports we were all starving...soooo we ended up eating lunch in the airport of all places...just what I've always dreamed of. WOW what a great vacation. The hotel did not offer to comp the boys room or offer us a free meal or anything. We insisted that they move them out of that room and they did do that much. We were given phone numbers to call when we got home and led to believe that there was going to be an investigation and a detailed report. We have tried to call several times and Security tells us to cal Risk Management and vice versa. The hotel manager was no help either. Every one is passing the buck, That is what is most disturbing!! This was Felony Theft not to mention an unauthorized person in our childrens room. What if they had been hurt? Wow it all just gives me the creeps!!! Bottom line--I will NEVER stay at that or any other property owned by Harrahs and you shouldn't either. Their disposition and excuses and blaming totally ruined our first family vacation experience...", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prairie Grove, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cAverage, Nothing Special\u201d", "Author": "XNAGirl", "ReviewID": "UR60464375", "Content": "We stayed at Harrah's since it was the official hotel of Monster Jam World Finals.

They travel to Las Vegas at least once a year and our rooms were comped on their Total Rewards accounts so I can't really comment on the price of the rooms as we didn't pay for them. We had the basic room level in the Carnival tower which was perfect. Our view was of the Mardi Gras Tower and The Mirage. You could also see Treasure Island and the Venetian off to the side. It was clean and the beds were comfortable. We weren't fans of the pillows so if that's important to you you might want to consider bringing your own. They were feather pillows and got very flat when you put your head on them I prefer more support than that but my brother in law loves them and that's part of why they keep going back to Harrah's. It's sort of a personal preference thing but thought I would mention it. The only other thing I'll mention and by no means did this ruin our trip but while we rarely heard anything coming from the hallway or other rooms the noise coming from the windows was surprisingly loud. It's almost like they spent a lot of money on soundproofing the rooms but put in windows that aren't soundproofed at all. For example we were on the 12th floor but could hear people talking down below and one morning woke up to a semi backing up...beep beep beep at about 5 a.m. My brother in law's room however looked over the pool and Carnival Court and they could hear music bumping until about 4 a.m. so I am not complaining about the street noise at all. If you are a very light sleeper or this will bother you you might want to take ear plugs or do some research on a room that would be the quietest and request it. Otherwise the hotel was great with a perfect location right in the middle of the strip across the street from Caesar's Palace. We ate in the Cafe in Harrahs once and the food was good - not amazing but good. We also ate dinner at The Range one night and that was amazing. Very good food - great steaks. I had the wedge salad and the Peking Duck Confit from the appetizer menu and it was delicious and the perfect amount of food. My husband had the filet and it was cooked to perfection and so tender you could cut it with a butter knife. It is a little pricey but still worth it in my opinion. We also ordered room service for breakfast one morning and that was very good as well but pretty expensive but that's to be expected for room service. We aren't big gamblers but I played some slots and my husband played a little blackjack. We both won a little money but neither of us played enough to get anything comped. We ended up in the dueling piano bar one night. I'm not sure if it was late enough that they stopped charging a cover (we got there about midnight) or if they didn't charge that particular night but we paid no cover to get in. It was very entertaining but if you are sensitive about dirty or \"adult\" jokes you might not find it entertaining. We really wanted to make it to Toby Keith's bar and the buffet, but didn't make it. Maybe next time!

The safe was left shut by the previous guest, but someone came up about a half hour later to open it. We could see most of the Mirage and some of the parking deck and adjacent tower. The room was very clean on arrival and kept that way throughout the stay. The bed was very comfortable as well. The Midstrip location can't be beat.

I consider myself a regular guy, and felt very comfortable here, unlike high end places such as The Venetian and Wynn. The only thing I didn't like was the noise level within the hotel. When a toilet flushed in the next room, it sounded like a 747 taking off. There's a lot of airport noise as well as street traffic. This being Vegas, some guests can be noisy when returning to their room late at night. After one night I used earplugs, and it helped make sleep easier.

Everytime I was ready for a drink ,it seemed they knew it and was there to take order (some even knew when we wanted drinks and just brought them). Our last trip to Vegas we stayed at PH. We were so much happier with everything at Harrahs. Thanks Harrahs for showing that the old Vegas charm is still alive somewhere. PS if you eat breakfast at the coffe shop only order one. My wife ordered blueberry pancakes, they were huge, enough to feed 3 or 4 people. I ordered ham and eggs and the piece of ham covered the whole plate with 3 eggs, hashbrowns and toast. no wonder there was always a line to get in there.", "Date": "March 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, Texas", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location\u201d", "Author": "MichaelG18", "ReviewID": "UR57830012", "Content": "Right in the middle of the strip, next to the fast food places, and across from the nightlife!", "Date": "March 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, location\u201d", "Author": "littlefinnie", "ReviewID": "UR57583129", "Content": "Hotel was comfortable, clean and basic with a great location.

Harrah's casino is just okay--we spent more time at the Flamingo where the drinks were steady and our luck was better! (Harrah's could definitely have better floor service for beverages.) Toby's bar was expensive and the bartender was rude/arrogant, but the cover band was pretty good. The outdoor bar (not owned by Harrah's I don't think) was happening, the bartenders were entertaining, it was pricey, and the band we thought was so very awesome turned out to be piping in the \"real\" band and lip syncing!

Our Deluxe room met our expectations, was very clean & quiet. The majority of our days booked were comped and we love its locations so this wasn't too hard to accept. The room was equipped with a coffee machine which was nice but the fridge is nothing but a pain and a ripoff. Do not open and try to put anything you bought inside it as you will be charged. I just wish they'd leave the thing empty for your use like they do at the Flamingo. Personally we can't comment too much on the casino as we like to play elsewhere for the most part. I do find that they have too many dollar slot machines as I prefer the quarter games (when I'm willing to throw away a couple bucks!) We played in their poker room but find the atmosphere dry & stale. The dealers seem to be rather unhappy for some reason, they don't talk nor smile - not even when you tip them! We never found any table games under 10 dollars so again we took our money elsewhere to try our luck. They have this litttle spot tucked in between the poker room and the sports book where you can get some grub. The sandwiches there are amazing, made to order and mmm mmm good. Another night we tried Toby Keiths bar & grill and enjoyed our selections - again no complaints. We opted one morning to have breakfast in the cafe, personally I found this a little overpriced as there are many other places we could have gone but stayed there due to its convenience. The buffet was pretty good but if we didn't have comps to use I'm not sure we would have dined there. Being that they had tons of food out and that they weren't overly busy made me wonder what they did with the food at the end of the night......things that make you go hmmmmm. How many different dishes can you make with leftover pasta night after night?? We made use of the gym and spa which was a nice break. It was nothing fancy but had all the ammenities we required. We went from 4 - 7 and it only cost us $5.00 being we hold Platinum players cards - sweet! The staff in the spa are extremely friendly and constantly asked if we needed anything - thank you.

I barely even took into consideration the quality of rooms when booking. I must say that Harrah's really surprised me with their outstanding quality of reasonably priced rooms. The beds were super soft (maybe too soft even), the bathroom was spacious, and there were more mirrors than anyone could possibly need. The TV was fairly old and the toilet sometimes didn't stop running, but other than that no complaints. The Flavors buffet was great for breakfast, though I can honestly say I've never seen a breakfast buffet with cotton candy before. The Harrah's Cafe was only average. Their late-night $5.99 steak & eggs combo was a good deal but the steak was pretty gristly. And of course, I can't say enough about the Toby Keith bar on the second floor.

Was already paying $118/night. Weird that 4 co-workers standing behind me and 7 co-workers in front of me got their rooms without having to upgrade. It would be understandable if I were last in line. Did not get to check in until 5:45pm. No apology or offer of anything to compensate me. Set the clock radio to a specific radio station. 24 hours later when I verified the station, it had been changed to the opposite end of the dial. Assume the housekeeping staff changed it while they cleaned the room. Should not do that during my stay--after check out and between guests is OK. First night, I had to spend 20 minutes with tech support to get in-room Internet connection ($11.95/day) to work. Nothing wrong with my laptop, they were just \"working on the server\". Third night, same issue and had to waste another 15 minutes even with my service ticket from first call. On third night at about 10pm, I heard what I thought was somebody running up and down the hall. Thought it was odd that the sound was stationary, then I realized it was the room next to mine. The headboard was banging against the shared wall. The woman moaning leads me to believe my neighbors were not \"running\". Water pik shower head with 6 settings was stuck on 1 setting. The refrigerator had so many disclaimers and warnings about automatic charges for any mini bar items, I did not even open it. It looked really tacky. The iron was connected to the ironing board by a wire cord for security which made ironig difficult. 27\" tube TV speakers are worn out, and entire TV shold be replaced. The elevators were extremely shop worn. Push button for a floor and it would not light up. One of largest trade shows of the year was being held at Las Vegas Convention Center, yet at time of check-in, front desk had no details about shuttle bus pick-ups.

This was a combination \"delayed 10th anniversary/sons 17th birthday/need to get away fr a few days\" trip to Vegas, timed to coincide with the National Finals Rodeo. I had originally booked us at The Orleans (based upon reviews on TA), but switched over to Harrah's because of friends who were meeting us who had booked through one of the gambling packages which required them to stay at Harrah's. I booked online, and decided to \"splurge\" a little for one of the newer, upgraded rooms in the Mardi gras tower. When we checked in (about 6:00 in the evening) and got to the room, we immediately knew that the room they had given us wasn't gonna work. The music coming up from the street (the Strip) was so loud in rattled the walls. Called the front desk, was told the music quit at about 2 a.m., but they moved us across the hall with no problems and it was fine----couldn't hear a thing. The rooms are nice, clean, expansive as regular hotel rooms go, and the beds were really comfortable. So, all in all, I'm pleased at this point. Now, the few negative points. First, our nice, luxurious 40 something inch flat screen TV quit after the first night. When I discovered this (Friday evening) I called down, and a maintenance man came right up. After poking and prodding, he decided he couldn't fix it, so he told me to \"take it up with the front desk\". Upon calling down, we were told the only thing they could do was move us to another room. Now, I don't know how everybody else does it, but my wife is one of those who has to unpack her entire suitcase and put everything in drawers as soon as she get into a room, especially if were going to be there for a few days. When I relayed that the only way we could get a TV was to pack everything up and move to another room, she reached for her book, so I had the answer to that question. In that it was late on Friday afternoon/evening, decided to just live without it and maybe something could be done the next day (Saturday). After being out of the room most of the day Saturday, we came back to the room and found that someone had been in messing with the TV again, but still no working TV. Message lights blinking, call down and get told \"We cant fix your TV, if you want we can move you to another room\". We're tired, kinda cranky, and just want to relax, so moving to another room wasn't going to work for any of us. Here's my question. If they can move us to another empty room which (apparently) has a working TV, why couldn't they simply bring a TV from one of those rooms and replace the one in our room? While it meant a little more work for the hotel, it wold have been a greta thing for us. I suggested this ot the desk, they said they would look into it and get back to us, never heard from them again. SO, consequently, 3 of the 4 nights we were there, \"sans TV\". As I said, no big deal, but they do advertise and sell these new, upgraded rooms with having these new, big, flat screen TV's (which I assume means they think they can charge more for them), so it would have been nice if they could have gotten us one. Or at least adjusted our bill to reflect the lack of this amenity, which didn't happen either. On to the next complaint. Remember I said I had booked my room online, and paid more to get the \"upgraded\" Mardi gras tower room? and remember I said that the reason we were at Harrahs at all was because our friends had booked one off those cheap, \"fly and stay\" Vegas deals which (usually) means you stay in one of the less expensive, lower quality rooms, right? Guess who was 2 doors down from our \"Upgraded, pay us more but you get more (like big screen TV's) \" room? Yep, our \"going to Vegas on the cheap because were not gonna be in the room long anyhow\" friends!! WTF!!!! I asked him if he upgraded, answer back, \"Nope, this is the room they gave us\". Only difference between theirs and ours was that they paid $40.00 a night less, and had a working, 40 something inch flat screen TV! Final complaint. Gawd I hate these \"charge extra for internet\" hotels. Even when I am gone for vacation, I have to stay connected to the office back at home, and at Harrahs the only way you do that is pay $12 a day. Come on, that ought to be part of standard service now, it is (almost) 2010. Welcome to 21st, age of the internet, century, Harrah's!! Anyhow, we did have a good time, the hotel staff are friendly and really accommodating, the rooms are more than adequate, and it is well located. Not saying I wouldn't stay there again, or that I wouldn't recommend this to someone, but I'd have to think about it real hard before I did. I'm giving it a thumbs up because the positives slightly outweighed the negatives, but its a real slim margin-----", "Date": "December 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Havasu City, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, excellent price, excellent value!\u201d", "Author": "mrsstewart09", "ReviewID": "UR51351060", "Content": "First off, I need to say the location of Harrah's is one of the best things about the place. RIGHT in the center of the Strip, with easy access to everything. I had read reviews about Harrah's and wasn't too confident going in, but my husband and I were pleasantlly suprised. The hotel lobby/casino part itself is really nothing to write home about, but the room was very comfortable and spacious, and had little amenities it's sister hotel next door (The Flamingo) doesn't, like a mini-fridge! Parking, check-in, and the walk to the hotel room were easy and uneventful. We did not get the King room we requested, but on well, that has happened to us in Vegas more than one time (and we're always there within an hour of check-in time everywhere, so I can't understand why that always happens to us). When we got to our room we were planning on just throwing our stuff in and running back out, but we spent a little extra time checking out the room because we were impressed at how comfortable it was. The bed was GREAT, very comfortable. Eventhough it was a Queen it felt bigger, seriously. When you exit the casino you enter a little courtyard area with shopping kiosks and little places to eat, so that's neat. It's situated right between the Imperial Palace and Harrah's and is crowded because pretty much everyone has to walk through it on their way down/up the Strip. There is also an area set up to eat/drink and watch some live entertainment, which was cool. We stood around for a bit and watched a 70's cover band sing and have some fun with an audience member on stage. They have a pool, but it's nothing to write home about either. It was November when we went, so using the pool was not an option for us, so I cannot attest for the pool \"ambiance\" or anything like that. If you want to see an awesome pool, go next door to it's sister property, the Flamingo! Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for your average 3-star hotel experience.

Trying to save my company a little money, so booked at Harrah's (meeting was at the Ventian, which is essentially next door, but much more expensive). Stayed in the Carnaval tower (their spelling, not mine!). Check-in: Went quickly, clerk was pleasant and helpful. Didn't ask for an upgrade, and wasn't offered one. No problem. Room: Clean, comfortable, had obviously been remodeled/upgraded fairly recently. Was very clean, beds very comfortable, TV was plain, but worked fine. Bathroom was very clean. Elevators to room (21st floor) were commendably quick and reliable. Room was on the 'backside\" of the strip, so view was of parking garage 15 stories below, and out over the expanse of Vegas and of towards the mountains. Strip view would have been nice, but the view we had was actually quite fine. As a bonus, I rented a car, parked it on the garage roof, could keep an eye on it very easily, just in case. Casino: There are nicer casinos nearby, but, really, it was OK. Drink service prompt and friendly, easy to find your way around the casino, and to your room elevator. (most Vegas casino floors are very confusing, and easy to get lost/disoriented in, at least for me) Other amenities: Well, except for the Mac King comedy/magic show (which was Great!), didn't really take advantage of any of the casino food/health club ,etc, as most meals were provided as part of my business meeting. But, if you want to save money or are in a hurry, there is a McDonalds and a Denny's right to the North of the building, as well as a Subway in the Casino Royal Next door. Other thoughts: Right on the center strip, convenient to just about everything the strip has to offer. Maid service was some of the nicest and most responsive of any I have ever had in Vegas. Stayed at the Flamingo last time in Vegas, and that was OK, too. But, Harrah's is better. Rooms are nicer and newer, service is better, and Casino floor is less confusing.

My friend's parent provided us with a free stay, which was one of the best gift ever! Harrah's owns hotel/casino across the U.S., and many in Las Vegas such as Ceasar's Palace, Flamingo, and Paris Las Vegas. The Harrah's hotel is in a fabolous location on the strip next to the Venetian and across the street from the Forum Shops at Ceasars. Harrah's offers two towers and the one we stayed was nearer to the Strip. However, the room we stayed in had a view of the back of the strip overlooking the parking garage for the Venetian. Our room was comfortable and clean, which is all you need in Las Vegas, a place to sleep. We were able to fit up to five people in the room with two double beds. The bathroom and linens were clean. There were now rowdy people in the hallways so the sleeping quarters were very quiet. I didn't personally try the buffet, but my friends ate the breakfast buffet and said it was amazing. However, if you come into Las Vegas late at night do not take the $5.99 steak and eggs offer. My friends and I was not too happy after eating it at the small restaurant downstairs at Harrah's. The monorail stops in the back of the hotel near a bridge the connects both Harrah's and Imperial Palace next door. This monorail can take as far north as the Sahara hotel and down to the last stop at the MGM Grand hotel. My take in the monorail is that a day pass was a waste since we walked on the strip most of the time. If you are in a group, I would suggest riding the cab instead of paying for the monorail. We literally only used the day pass for one ride to the MGM and walked to strip back to Harrah's. I had fun gambling, but lost most of it at Harrah's. The issue I had with the casino in this hotel was that it felt stuffy and enjoyed to more open space the Venetian and New York New York offered to gamblers. I have checked the Mirage and Treasurer Island and remembered it being kind of dark in the casino floor. However, there is this hole in the wall casino next to Harrah's that my friend won big and the minimum bets are smaller than the hotel casinos. I would reccomend Harrah to other travelers because you can't beat the location where it is walkable up and down the strip and nearby major shopping at the Venetian, Forum, Wynn, and Fashion Show Mall. There is a monorail stop in the back of the hotel to take you up and down the hotels on the strip. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and comfortable.

There is a monorail station right above the lobby, which was wonderful (the stations at MGM and Bally's were LONG walks from the road). All rooms we saw were very clean and tidy, and housekeeping did a good job. The front desk was quick and efficient, getting through long check in lines faster than other hotels we have stayed at. The Carnival Court bar was loads of fun, with bartenders doing bottle tricks and live music (also outdoor blackjack tables), and the Poker Room was nice. The Bad: We were booked into a regular room, so we paid a $35 a night upgrade to a \"minisuite\". Apparently \"minisuite\" means that the room has 2 phones and a coffee maker in the bathroom, but is otherwise EXACTLY like a regular room! Don't bother paying to upgrade!\u00a0 We found all of the food choices lacking, even the \"newly remodeled buffet\", however that was easily remedied with the short walk across the street to the Mirage, which had great food. The Harrah's Sunday breakfast buffet changed over to lunch at 9:45 am, since when is that lunch time?? The pool in a word: Terrible. The actual pool is tiny and freezing, so don't bother trying to swim. How could a pool in the desert be cold? Because its completely in the shade ALL DAY. If you want to catch sun you have to walk up stairs from the pool and sit on the \"sun deck\", or as normal people refer to it as: the roof. The most annoying thing by far was the room temperature. They use energy efficient motion detectors on the thermostat, so the AC doesn't kick on if you're not in the room. Unfortunately the wall the unit was mounted on is angled away from the bed, so when you are sleeping the AC never kicks on! Two nights we had to get up in the middle of the night and dance around the other side of the room to get the temperature to a reasonable level. For young people that have never been to Vegas, think twice about Harrah's, or anywhere on the North Strip for that matter. Our group of just under 30's was easily the minority, and the same looked true for all of the surrounding properties besides The Mirage. As an example, we sat down for drinks at the piano bar during karaoke hour, just as \"High Ho Silver, Away\" started being sung. No thanks.

Having been to Vegas before I knew Harrahs is at the bottom end of the food chain so my expectations were dismal prior to arrival but it was not as dire an experience as I had braced myself for. There are 2 towers of rooms at Harrahs. The Mardis Gras and the Carnaval. On arrival at 5PM we were informed our room was not ready - this seems to be a common theme for this hotel based on other reviews. After dinner and some lounging around we finally got our room at 7.30PM - not a good start and the front desk staff were rather indifferent to their customers first impressions. The room was in the Mardis Gras Tower and was small, dark, depressing and had a connecting door to the room next door that was occupied. The bathroom was also small and dark. After 3 nights in this room we moved to the Carnaval tower after being peristant in our complints of noise. I would equate the Mardi Gras tower room to a Motel 6 style room. The Carnaval tower has beeen somewhat refurbished and the room was slightly larger. Bathroom, lighting etc was similar to the previous room. TV's are from the 1980's with poor channel choice and picture quality. The room was only marginally quieter. You can hear your neighbours activities quite easily, toilets flush with an immense \"woosh\", doors slam easily and if it is a room within 20 yards of yours it is akin to a gun shot if the person is inconsiderate (and let's face it most people are). So in the 10 nights we did not get one uninterrupted nights sleep. I would equate these rooms to an older Hampton Inn. Internet is charged and is not exactly lighning fast. We ate dinner in the oyster bar (mediocre food) once and had breakfast in the cafe. Breakfast quality was reasonable but not cheap - average $20/head (including tax and tip) for a fairly basic offering. There is ALWAYS a wait for a table for breakfast yet the restaurant was always half empty - strange. Valet parking is fairly efficient but you naviagte ridiculous speed bumps to get in and enter through a smelly back part of the hotel. The other guests in this hotel were mainly elderly and obviously on a strict budget. Walkers, riding carts etc were common and the vast majority of them smoked. The smell of cigarette smoke permeates this building and everything in it - nasty. The casino has low ceilings, feels cramped and slots/tables are almost shoe horned in next to one another. If you don't smoke you soon will be in this casino - again nasty. Our room service was reasonabley prompt and the room was fairly clean, carpets did feel a little nasty though. Shower water escapes the tub easily and volume is low. There is a safe in the room and we used it or anything valuable. Basically this is a bottom feeder hotel and casino and is only saved by it's location and an apparantly loyal but aging clientel. If you are over 50, on a budget, smoke 40 a day and have the dress sense of Archie Bunker - this is the place for you.

I had a 5 night stay from the 26th Sept until the 1st October. Check in was for the 1st time ever dismal. 3 agents working on a Saturday afternoon, is almost inexcusable.....however, after a 45min wait, I was served by one of Harrah's friendly staff....and all was forgiven. I was given a room in the Mardi Gras tower. Standard un renovated room.....and it was fine. This is a 3 star hotel and I know what to expect, so no disappointments or surprises. The rooms are around 350sq/ft.....which to me as a solo traveller is ample. The furnishings are of sound quality and the bed was very comfortable. The linens were not scratchy and the towels were fluffy and clean. The bathroom though small was spotlessly clean. The television was the old crt type and the stations were limited. The thing I love about staying at Harrah's....and the reason I chose it over Caesars or Paris, even on a comped stay, are the staff! Just fantastic. I love how the staff are willing to help and are friendly. The poker room staff are brilliant and run a top quality show. The tournaments are fun, and the new deep stack tourneys are incredible value for money. The cocktail waitresses at Harrah's are honestly apreciative of a tip, remember your drink and it's always service with a smile. Harrah's location is pretty hard to beat, slap bang in the middle of all the action. Carnival Court is a blast that slowly kicks off after lunch and parties until the weeeee hours of the morning. The restaurants are reasonably priced, the atmosphere is fun, the staff are friendly, the customers all seem to be repeat stayers, the buffet is yummy, the rooms are comfortable, there is Starbucks, the location is unbeatable....there are just so many things to like about Harrah's.... if they were ever having a bad day....it's pretty easy for them to be forgiven....like when I checked in. Would I stay at Harrah's again?...You bet! Would I recommend it to friends, family and fellow travellers?...Yes, if they were looking for a brilliant location at a reasonable price with friendly staff. Is it a luxury hotel...No, but it doesn't pretend to be. Harrah's is a middle of the road place, for middle of the road type of people who like good value for money and a nice comfortable, not flashy place to rest their head. cheers shirl'", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dearborn Heights, MI", "Title": "\u201cVery Pleased!\u201d", "Author": "Sadiegirl6", "ReviewID": "UR46127921", "Content": "Stayed 10/3/09-10/6/09. This hotel is all about conveniences. It is in a great location on the strip. There is plenty of food options in the hotel and in its surrounding outside that are affordable. It is easy to walk to other properties from the hotel; that are also Total Rewards points. I was traveling with seven others who all felt very much the same and no one had any bad experiences. Our group stayed in both Mardi Gras and Carvanal Towers. The rooms were very clean, the beds were comfortable, but our alarm clock did not work. We stayed in a standard room and the decor was slightly modernized but needed TV upgrades, etc. The housekeeping staff was friendly, they did not knock on your door at 9:00 am wanting to clean them and did a nice job when they were through. The bartenders were cool and talkactive and the drinks were reasonable. Carnival Court is constant action, the bartenders put on a show. There are different bands playing throughout the day, dancefloor, $3-$5 drink specials. If you wanted to drink in your room, the hotel had two mini convenience stores that you could get alchohol, mixers, beer, cigarettes and gifts. If what you are a looking for is a good, solid hotel that can basically accomodate most types of Las Vegas travelers and wallets, then stay at Harrah's. It is not a value motel, but it is also not a posh resort. If you you are looking for a more standout, upscale experience, then you would not like Harrah's. My only real complaints were that I had to pay $10 to use the gym, no free wi fi and I did not like talking to their Reservation agents (not at the hotel - over the phone). They weren't very friendly, they sounded annoyed with me for only asking simple questions. I booked the reservation through Expedia and needed to make special requests for the room and they really wouldn't work with me. The reservations they had on file, weren't what was stated on my Expedia reservation. Expedia had to call them and get things corrected, twice. The booking part of the trip was a pain.

As we have stayed at Harrahs we chose the deluxe room, because of the slightly upgraded room with comfy beds, the room is very small and the pool virtually useless, but the location is good, that is about all Harrahs has going for it. Next time I would actually rather stay at the Imperial, we have stayed here in the past for a cheap room, and hey they at least treat you with respect.

Was told guests ocuppying had not checked out. So we left our luggage with luggage services and check out the areas. At about 1:30pm, we checked back in to see if our room was ready - it wasn't. They had another room in the Carnival Tower that was 2 queen beds that were available so we took it since we wanted to check-in and put our stuff away; besides, the King bed wasn't important (this is what we had reserved). Ours was a non-smoking room on the 7th floor. I thought the room was decent given the price we paid. Everything worked - we had no problem with it. We spent most of our time out and about so the only time we were in the room was to sleep. As most say - you get what you pay for. There was some noise (like a woodpecker pecking) but when we called the front desk we were told that it was due to construction and that we shouldn't hear it during bedtime. True to their words. Our room was a reasonale walk to the casino floor. We thought the location was a good place on the strip. We checked out all of the hotels on the strip during our stay. Looking back, I didn't think the Harrahs was smokier (meaning a lot of smoke floating around) than most. I think what it was is that it has a heavy smoke smell due to poor ventilation, perhaps? Outside of that it is the same as most other hotels. We thought their buffet was OK - we had coupons so that helped with cost. We at their Cafe' restaurtant and I thought for the price we had paid for 2 breakfast entrees - we would've found more value at the buffet but couldn't go there because it was after breakfast hours and we wanted breakfast. We also ate at Ming's Table - didn't like it so much. They have express check-out service via using menu on the TV. Based on others' reviews of the long lines, we took advantage of this feature and used the Express check-out. We didn't use any services while we stayed there nor touch the bar fridge so our account was '0' which made the Express check-out much easier.

The check-in clerk was unable to give me the \"Deluxe\" room type because the smoking rooms in this category are only on the 3rd floor, with no view--and I always like a high-floor with a view! So I accepted a regular room on the 25th floor of the Carnival tower with a nice view of the Mirage and the exploding volcano! I got my view! The room was decently furnished and had everything I needed for my stay. The weird thing (that I had previously heard from other reviewers) is that the HVAC system is motion-activated. When you are not in the room, it doesn't cool down. It begins when you enter the room, but because of this setup, it never seemed to get as cool as I wanted it. The location is perfect! Right on the strip, with easy access to Imperial Palace, Flamingo, Caesars, Mirage, Treasure Island and the Venetian. The monorail is steps from the back of the property. Also, shuttles to various off-strip properties are in back by the valet/shuttle area. Very convenient! I used the spa 2 different days, and went after 4:00 pm when the price drops from $25 per day to only $10. I also sat out at the pool 2 days, although the pool deck is very small and doesn't accommodate a lot of chairs, so I had to sit up at the \"over-flow\" area. This wasn't too bad, although I would have rather have sat with a view of the pool. Very frequent drink service, though! I only ate at one restaurant, which was the Flavors buffet for breakfast one morning. Good food, and I was able to use a $5 off coupon that they hand out in the Carnival Court area. I also got coffee each morning at one of the 2 Starbucks coffee locations right outside the Carnival elevators, or at the 24-hour McDonalds right next door to Harrahs on the strip. Gambling was not real kind to me until just before I left when I hit for $450 on a .25 cent machine. But I still enjoyed the selection of slot machines and video poker machines (I do not play table games). I didn't put a lot of points on my Total Rewards account during my stay, but I was glad that my room was free and didn't need to play for the comps (well, I guess I previously had done that!!!).

I think it's good for one person. You cannot share the bathroom because the mirror is made for a single person. Also, the TV in the bathroom is good if you are sitting on the toilet. I didn't use it. I thought when people mentioned the TV in the bathroom, it was the kind that is IN the mirror but I was wrong. The tub was dirty so we asked housekeeping to clean it again. The tub and sink would not drain properly so we asked maintenance to fix it three days in a roll before it finally worked properly.

Housekeeping should have noticed when she was cleaning which gives you an idea of how well they clean...This room had a view of the Mirage Volcano and you can hear the music even with the balcony door was closed.

There's a place on the right side with misters so you can stay cool. There's also a sundeck upstairs on the left hand side. However, Caesars pool was much nicer even though there was construction around, the noise wasn't that bothersome. Casino is small and there wasn't a lot of choices. I lost several thousand and I felt like they didn't care or pay that much attention to rate me. I only had $26 in comps. I felt Caesars was much nicer and took care of me. Ballys was okay. Even though my room was comped based on my previous play, I don't think I would stay there again. My boyfriend said he would stay again but he wasn't in the room that much. I think if you have never stayed in Vegas and don't need a high class place, this is a good place for you. Next time, I think I'll try Caesars.", "Date": "August 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cI had a great time at Harrah's!\u201d", "Author": "Nautee", "ReviewID": "UR36728461", "Content": "I was very pleased with Harrah's service.

As many have noted, the casino is very smoky and the decor looks old and washed out. It is listed as a 4 star hotel but I would say more like 3 at best. There were two things that I really noticed about this trip to Vegas. The first was that no one was winning anything, except at the craps table where the odds are best. No noisy, squealing slots, no excited Black jack players, no nothing. The bottom line, casinos are hurting and they need to make up for their lost revenue somehow. Gone are the days of inexpensive food as well. The second things I noticed was how trashy everything was, the streets, the hotels, the kiosks and even the people. Again, keep in mind the cheap prices and I think you can understand what I mean. Men standing outside of casinos giving out very graphic escort cards didn\u2019t help much. I felt sorry for the people with young children.

Whatever happened to, \"we just need a credit card for incidentals.\" This draws my ire and a considerably lower rating. The best part of my stay had to be the location, parking, and housekeeping. Harrah's is on the central strip, offers decent parking, and housekeeping was very kind and consistent. If it weren't for the housekeeping, I probably would've checked out early and stayed elsewhere. The worst part of my stay involved check-in (second worst ever) and the old television in my room. I think I was in one of the rooms that still needed a TV upgrade. Some things remain a constant. Range Steakhouse was fantastic, the gift shops I find very friendly, and it remains a terrific base location for the strip (as if it were gonna move anytime soon.) ;) I've stayed at Harrah's before so I know what it's like to have things nice and not as nice.

I had not been there for about 3 or 4 years. This time we stayed at Harrahs on the strip. Harrahs is in a great location. Right in the center of all of the action. If you don't want to rent a car, it is a perfect location since it is within walking distance to the Flamingo, Ballys, Cesars, Imperial Palace, MGM Grand and Paris. We got an upgraded room at check-in. We asked for a fridge for my friends medication, which they said was no problem and would deliver it to the room promptly. Check in time ( line) took about 50 minutes. The room was nice and clean. Very comfortable beds! However, the fridge did not arrive after waiting approx. an hour so my friend took her meds and put them in the \"mini bar fridge\" and we went on downstairs to gamble. When we got back that evening, the fridge still had not been delivered. We called the front desk and she told us it would be delivered in a few minutes. Again after waiting an hour we decided to go to bed. At noon the next day, stilll no fridge. We called again and finally after about 30 minutes the fridge was delivered. My friend changed her medications from the mini bar to the regular fridge. Harrah's machines need to be upgraded. They still have the same old machines from 10 years ago. They had very few new machines. The machines did not pay off for us. The machines at our local Indian casinos are so much better and newer and they actually pay off! Be prepared to pay for every convience at Harrahs. They charge 4.99 at their ATM's for money or balance inquiries. They charge 3.85 for a glass of tea. An 8 ounce bottle of water is 3.95. 12.00 for a sandwich. An extra 2.00 to get anything to go from their resturants. It cost 5.00 to use their internet to try an access our boarding passes. The internet never did work for us after putting in 10.00. Some drunk on the second floor came out of the Toby Keith's bar and decided to hit me HARD on my butt while I was trying to get the internet access to work. He thought it was halarious. It has been 3 days and I still have a hand sized bruise on my butt. If I had not been so stunned by his actions, I would have immediately called security. Instead, I waited for about 5 minutes and called them when I got back into my room. I asked the front desk to put the 10.00 back on our tab since the internet never would work. They said they had nothing to do with that and I had to call the internet provider to get a refund. I told them about the man hitting me, they connected me with security, who told me I should have called them from the location it happened. Silly me, I thought they had security cameras everywhere. Oh well, live and learn. We had a nice dinner for four at the Outback Steakhouse. Steak and lobster tail for each of us , 3 teas and a water with tip was 176.00 We paid 60.00 per person at the Rio for the seafood dinner and I would not recommend it for the price. Over the course of 4 days, using our Harrahs cards and playing at their sister casino's we only recieved 41.00 in comps. But the biggest surprise of all was at check out. They charged us 50.00 for using the mini bar for my friends medications. Apparently, if you use their in room fridge for anything personal they charge 50.00. NO EXCEPTIONS!! I am guessing that is why it took 2 days to get the fridge delivered to our room. I guess when the economy is bad and people are not spending as much money gambling they feel they have to rob them any way they can to make up the bottom line. Anyway, that was my last trip to Vegas. I will drive the 30 miles to the Indian casinos where they have great comps, all of the newest machines that actually pay off and treat me with respect. Over the years I have been to Vegas probably 20 times. I have stayed in the some of the least expensive to the most expensive hotels. I have found the best way to do Vegas is to rent a condo, and rent a car. That way you have all of the comforts of home and a car to go anywhere you want to go, anytime you want to go. The condos are usually about 150 to 250 for a week and the car is about the same. The condo will usually sleeps at least 4 and has washer and dryers, dishes, cooking utensils, outdoor grills, complete kitchens, a jaccuzi in the condo and a pool outdoors.", "Date": "July 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "north carolina", "Title": "\u201cBest location,Best Deal,Best buffet,Love the outdoor carnival theme !!!\u201d", "Author": "scenicrentals", "ReviewID": "UR34306630", "Content": "We had the best time ever , great deal and room was very nice good size and away from noise .Great selection of economical food and stores One minor complaint staff at other harrah's have been much more attentive but for price don't mind if they don't look up when they talk to you .

After reading the reviews I was scared to death because a lot of them were negative. Harrah's was totally awesome. I was stunned. The room was neat and tidy, roomservice was excellent, and my husband upgraded our room to a \"view\", because it was my first Vegas trip. It was a perfect view. I could see the full volcano erupt at the Mirage. It was perfect. I did learn a few things as a first time Vegas visitor and expecting the worst. I feel obligated to share. 1. There were lots of negative reviews about the \"smokey\" smell of the hotel/casino. HELLO! The hotel was built in 1972, people were smoking EVERYWHERE (you couldn't escape it). Have some freaking sense people! Smokers are going to smoke hence a \"smokey\" smell. I think a lot of the reviews were dramatized. My husband is allergic to tobacco smoke, he did not have one allergy attack. It wasn't that bad at all. 2. There were lots of negative reviews about \"upgrades with a view\". OK, I personally think that when people hear \"a view\" they think of the movies where you can see the whole strip. That ain't gonna happen at Harrah's, youre in the middle of the strip. The views are great but don't set yourself up for disapointment. 3. There were lots of complaints about the rooms, plugs, and things of that nature. What I don't understand is, why would you go on vacation to Vegas and sit in your hotel room and play on your laptop, text on your phone, and watch TV. That is a waste. The rooms are totally efficient to those who go to Vegas to play. If you have other intentions this is not the hotel for you. Only bad side of the room, no in house coffee pot. That sucked. There where a few other things that I wish I had a warning about. Here's the tips for first time Vegas vacationers. 1. Plan extra cash for food, we sooooo underbudgeted meals. It's not cheap to eat in Vegas no matter what people tell you. 2. There are people handing out \"dirty\" business cards everywhere. A teenage boys dream! These cards end up scattered all over the ground and can be easy to slip on. 3. Don't get obliterated drunk in Vegas. C'mon people, it's ok to drink but know when to say when. I thank God I have a big heart, I helped quite a few girls find their hotel rooms when they could barely walk. One girl was in the wrong hotel. Not good people. I personally think Vegas is not for families, but who am I to judge? I did have a personal problem with people with babies in their strollers, walking around at 1 AM. I do think that's way inappropiate. Please people, Vegas is great and I wish I would of had my little boy with me to see LOVE, the Volcano, and the Bellagio fountains. But as a parent, I know he can wait a while to see that stuff, plus I video taped it for him. Overall Vegas is an adult town, not recommended for small children. MY OPINION ONLY!

It is across the street from Mirage & Caesar's Palace. We upgraded to a room in the Mardi Gras Tower from the Carnival Tower after finding our original room smelled like smoke even though it was a non-smoking room. We were told all the rooms in the Mardi Gras Tower have been recently refurbished/updated. If the view from your window is important to you, stay away from Room #506 and other even #'s rooms around it and the floors below it as it faces the heating/air conditioning units. The room was well appointed & spacious. We could not hear hallway noise but we could hear our neighbors very well through the connecting suite door. If you like your room kept cool, keep the air conditioning set at the lowest temperature. We think the a/c might be motion activated since we found it became cooler the longer we were back in the room as if it wasn't on all day long. We pulled the curtains closed to try to keep the room cool but the maid service pulled them wide open every day after cleaning the room. The ammenities bar is set up with some kind of monitoring system that will charge you for just removing the item from its spot so if you do not want what you see, don't even move it! Bathroom was spacious and clean. Towels very clean. Shower pressure not so good but adequate. Flat panel television in the bathroom was a nice touch. Bed was very comfortable and sheets & blanket were very clean. Onto the casino. Unfortunately, NOTHING influenced me to gamble here. The casino is very dingy & outdated. I was surprised that Harrah's has let it go so much since it also owns so many upscale casinos on the strip. The slots are boring & the tables mundane. I'm not sure what the theme of this hotel is as it's trying to be many things for many people at the same time. I would suggest they hire someone to clean the glass doors of the main entrance every 30 minutes as they are full of greasy handprints all the time. Nothing is inviting to the outside passerby to stop by & gamble. Skip the restaurants especially the cheap steak & eggs late night dinner. Go to Denny's for breakfast a few steps down the street. You'll save a ton of $$. I'm predicting that this casino will be the next one to be imploded because the cost to update & refurbish it will be more than to just start over.

At Harrah's you get pretty much what you pay for an average hotel at a very good price 40 US a night. There are some pretty good things about staying at Harrah\u2019s for one the location is amazing, Harrah\u2019s is pretty much center strip so if you want to go on the gondolas in the venetian or see the fountains of the Bellagio it\u2019s all a short walk or a monorail stop away. Secondly contrarily to what people say I felt the prices at the restaurants were pretty reasonable. We ate at Toby\u2019s on two occasions and our meals as well as our drinks came out to 35 dollars or less on both occasions, \u201c12 dollars for two pitchers of beers is a great deal for all you drinkers out there\u201d Check in was a breeze we arrived at 10am and our room was ready for us and we got free coupons to see Mac king \u201cwith purchase of drink at show\u201d. The rooms are pretty small true but you\u2019re in Vegas there is no need to stay in the room for long periods of time. Now for the bad, the pool is terrible. They are definitely going to have to close the pool soon and change the lining on the floor it\u2019s lumpy and falling apart and to top it off the pool area is extremely dirty. We stayed there for four nights and went to the pool every day to tan and there was a bloody bandage right next to the steps of the pool from the day we checked in till the day we left. Also we went to use the Jacuzzi at nine thirty am one day only to find that there were cups and beer bottles still laying around it from the night before pretty gross. The room we were staying in seemed to lack any plugs so if you wanted to charge your cell phone you would have to either unplug something or charge it in the bathroom. For all those who have already booked a room at Harrah\u2019s beware check your credit card statements while you are there. Harrah\u2019s ask for a deposit when checking for room service and incidentals the receptionist will say you can either give her two hundred dollars in cash for this or your credit card will be charged one hundred dollars a day on incidentals, which the hotel will hold until you check out. Needless to say we gave them cash only to find out two days later that they were taking money out of my card anyway, I had to go downstairs and speak to a supervisor twice before they fixed this needless to say it was a big headache.

This past weekend (May 30-June 2) my boyfriend and I flew out to Las Vegas with a couple of friends for a long weekend vacation. When arriving in Las Vegas we came right to Harrah\u2019s and were able to check right in. I mentioned to the lady that checked us in that we had a Premium room booked, and showed her my reservation confirmation page. She then told us that were in a Luxury room, and we thought, all the better. She told us we were going to have a view of the strip and would be able to see the Mirage Volcano erupt at night out of our ceiling to floor window. Who wouldn\u2019t want that, right? So after we finish checking in we head up to our room, located in the Mardi gras tower on the 16th floor, and come to find out that our room isn\u2019t so luxurious to say the least. First, the television would not work, so we had to call maintenance to come and fix the television. It was unplugged. Second, our air conditioner would not run for longer than 5 minutes, and then in order to turn it back on, we had to keep on getting up and walking past the sensor on the thermostat. Again we had to call maintenance to come to our room to fix the thermostat, so the air would constantly stay on. Our room still did not remain cold. Third, whenever my boyfriend or I would shower, the water from the shower would leak out all over the bathroom floor. So we ended up having to leave both the shower curtain and the curtain liner in the tub to reduce the water that was on the floor. Regardless, there would still be water on the floor. Also, I was not happy with the pool. It was impossible to get chairs to lie out on, or even a table to have lunch at. Once we were able to get a high top table, close to the bar, it was even harder to get a waitress to be waited on. Once we were able to track down a waitress to order drinks and food, the service time wasn\u2019t too bad, although the food wasn\u2019t all that appealing. I ordered a grilled chicken caesar wrap, and the lettuce was green with brown edges, and came out soggy. My friend ordered a cheeseburger with no tomato or onion, and both tomato and onion came out on the burger. Once lunch was over, we decided to go into the pool, next thing we know, they are setting up a volleyball net, that takes up the entire width of the pool, and is placed right in the center. So once in the pool, the volleyball game starts and my friend ends up getting hit in the head by the ball. So because of that we decided to get out of the pool, since there really wasn\u2019t anywhere you could go in the pool that was safe from the volleyball game. I was not too pleased with the pool, and spent the rest of my pool time at Caesar\u2019s for the duration of the vacation. I am rather disappointed in the room that we ended up in and the pool, and because of that would probably not stay at Harrah\u2019s again when I come out to Last Vegas. Regardless of the room that we did stay in, the casino, the restaurants and the bars were fun and good places to hang out.", "Date": "June 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "anchorage", "Title": "\u201ccomfortable and clean, good value\u201d", "Author": "wiscjudy2001", "ReviewID": "UR31246534", "Content": "I was very happy with maid service and food options offered.

We were told OUR room was available, but our second room for my son and his wife was not. We were told to come back in an hour and check the status. Still not available. We asked to give the kids our room and we would take another room as an upgrade. This room was ready for checkin, but was not what I would term a \"mini suite\". We asked the front desk to make sure that the credit cards on each room were correct. We were assured that our card was on our room and my sons card was on their room. Upon our return, my son got his credit card bill and had been charged for BOTH rooms. We also had issues with poor/rude service from the box office staff. When I registered my complaints via email upon our return, I received a \"polite\" response basically telling us, \"Gee, thats too bad\", I asked to be refunded our upgrade charge, to no avail. They DID fix the credit card snafu, but that was after several phone calls and eventually speaking to a customer service supervisor. These people just don't seem to care anymore. I also ate breakfast at the cafe, which was mediocre at best and after I paid, I found out from another customer that if I'd showed my players card I would have received a discount on my meal. NO ONE offered to tell me this when I paid that morning. On one of my calls regarding the credit card mixup, I'd asked to speak to \"Mary\" whom I'd spoken to the previous day.

I didnt have a view (just the top another building and part of the Imperial Palace hotel) but for free, I cant complain. The mardi gras tower brings you right down to the casino floor. I didnt have much luck at the casino and they didnt seem to have many newer games, but the buffet was really good. Harrahs is in an amazing location, right in the middle of all the major casinos.

We were given coupons at the front desk when we checked in and did not even use the others since we are not drinkers. The clerk read us our bill and stated we owed for a phone call and the two beers. She paused and we told her we had the Stay and Play package and we would like them to look it up. They insisted we owed and we asked to speak to a manager. They left us standing at the check out counter for more than 15 minutes. The manager did not come out but the clerk again came and told us that they would comp us for the beers, but that we had also had dinner there. This was not read to us the first time around and we did no such thing!! We requested to see the signature on the dinner bill but they could not produce it since they were closed in the accounting dept. When she read us the bill the first time through, there was no dinner listed. They threatened to call security because we still wanted to speak to a manager. After a good 1/2 hour of arguing, the clerk said they would not charge us unless the signatures matched, and we would have to wait to see if it was on our Visa bill. We left before they could add more false charges. I have received my Visa bill for the Package and it was 160.00 and change. I guess I will have to wait for the next bill to see if I was charged anything else above the phone call that I made. I have confirmation of the package I purchased and all paperwork.

To me it was just an average hotel. I'm not saying it was bad or had a bad experience but there was nothing exciting about it or anything that I can describe as excellent or well worth our while. I did get irritated with the fact that they took out a $50 deposit from my account for the mini-bar in our room. I told the desk person that we NEVER use the mini-bar in our hotel rooms no matter where we are. However, she pointed out that it's hotel policy to take a $50 deposit from each customer. I asked her when it would be returned back to my account. She said it can take up to two weeks. Two weeks ?? Luckily and all fairness to the hotel, I received my deposit back within two days after we checked out. However, the check-in line wasn't that long but we had to wait forever since there were only two people working the counter. The rooms were okay but no coffee pot, no micro (in short no frills). For being just an average run of the mill Vegas hotel in my opinion they charge too much. For a good point however, I had lost my credit card somewhere on the casino floor and I was extremely nervous. When I came back down from my room a policeman happened to be standing chatting to someone and I asked him where is the hotel Lost and Found. He was an extremely nice and calm man and asked me what I lost, where and when and told me to come with him. We went through a maze of doors down into the basement where there were all sorts of offices and locker rooms for hotel employees. When we got to the Lost and Found he looked and within a few seconds was able to locate my lost credit card. I was shocked and pleasantly surprised. There are still nice and honest people left in this world. I had to sign some papers, show ID and then I got my credit card back.

Another budget cut = no more free bungee cords for your players cards...you have to buy them in the gift shop! Luckily I had my own. Our room was very nice and we were offered a choice of view: Caesar's Palace or the Volcano at Mirage. We chose the Mirage view. Our 2 queen room was very nice and newly updated with marble floors in the entry and bath. We encountered a problem with 1st night with our room. It was directly above the loading dock which is used by Harrah's and McDonald's. Even with foam ear plugs we could hear the non-stop back up beepers on the hundreds of trucks. It went on all night and we slept very, very little. We asked to move to a quieter room and happily took a view of the top of the parking garage and mountains = no beeping trucks! We dined at the buffet and the cafe twice and all meals were excellent!! We also ate at the buffet at one of their other properties, The Flamingo and it was outstanding, especially if you love seafood! They had some of the best crab I have ever eaten and crepes station that was heavenly! My mom and I both enjoy the slot machines. We found the ventilation to be excellent in the casino and the beverage girls were some of the best I have ever seen. We never had to wait for a drink.

Live bands during the day turns night club at night. The pool is mediocre but the volleyball net they put up is really fun!!! Just bring your own alcohol.

Some tips: Check out the free volcano show at the mirage, siren show at treasure island, fountains at bellagio, tigers at mirage, sky inside of caesars, lions AT MGM, circus acts at circus circus, show in the sky at RIO.... ALL FREE!!!!!!!! Get deuce tickets!! MUCH cheaper than taxi and goes up and down the strip plus downtown where all the CHEAP gambling is. By the way make sure you check out downtown even if you don't like gambling. They have the free light show on Fremont with drag queens performing live music.... def the \"vegas vibe\" downtown.

Good service in the cafe. Starbucks was great and so was the sundry store. I used my $30.00 credit at Starbucks and at the sundry store. The casino was fairly busy but VERY VERY smoky. Lots of the people there were older than us and were smokers. It was unbearable at times. Harrah's needs to invest some $$ and upgrade their ventilation system if they want the non-smoking crowd to stay/play there! This is why we've almost always stayed at the Paris or Westin Causarina when in Vegas. The Westin is a non-smoking property and the Paris has great ventilation! The slots were very tight and I did not see many winners and myself was not a winner of anything. Usually I manage to break even at the least. Not this time. The hotel was ok for the value and the highpoints of our stay was the $30 resort credit and the good 'rewards' card program that is used at Harrah's and her sister properties. I racked up enough points for a $10 to spend in resort credits! I used a the buffet at the Paris and Starbucks in Harrah's.

Our room was large but unfortunately overlooked the employees parking lot and a garbage can down below, but who cares, we weren't there to hang out in our room. It was quiet except in the morning when we heard the garbage truck, but that was fine because we wanted to wake up anyways. We never heard any of our neighbours. The maids cleaned it very well every day. My only complaint about the room was that the bathroom fan didn't work and the hotel doesn't offer a service where they will save water by not washing your towels as long as you hang them up. It felt like a waste to have new towels every single day, but then again, the whole of Las Vegas seems like an environmental nightmare! So rooms were nice, check-in was fine. Check out took longer as everyone was lining up to check out at the same time. The clerks were very friendly and helpful. They booked us a trip to see the Grand Canyon. The casino has a lower ceiling that most casinos but also seemed brighter then most casinos. We didn't do much gambling anyways. We heard that if we gambled we could get a free drink, so we tried the penny slots for a few minutes but no free drinks! The only place we ate inside the hotel was the Chinese restaurant called Mings Table, which was very good. There is a Starbucks just below the elevator where we had coffee in the morning, but of course Starbucks are everywhere in Las Vegas, expensive and long lineups. Compared to other hotels that we looked in, Harrahs had less cheap restaurants (no fastfood or Subway) and not as many stores, which I liked because it got us out of the hotel. The best thing is the location. We are right across from the Mirage, which we ate in two nights(great restaurants), 5 minute from Treasure Island, The Wynn and some shopping on one side, and then 2 minutes from the Caesers Palace Forum shops and then less than a 15 minute (great) walk to Paris Las Vegas on the other side, passing the Flamingo and other places. Some people say that it needs to be updated, and one of my party thought that as well. The theme seems to be New Orleans Carnivale (which is creepy anyways if you ask me with all those masks) but I barely noticed that. It is newer than most hotels you will see on a typical road trip through North America, it's just that in Las Vegas everything has to always be so new to keep up with the Jones (ie-the other hotels) Also the Monorail is attached to Harrahs. All in all I really liked this place and would definately stay again.", "Date": "May 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lugoff, SC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value, Great Location, Fav Poker Room\u201d", "Author": "KeltonSC", "ReviewID": "UR29092077", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at Harrah's from April 5-10 for our anniversary trip.

We booked a deluxe room for only $39/night which is a steal. I think we might have been upgraded because we had a safe in the room; I was told the deluxe does not. No strip view but it was fine. The room was very clean, no complaints. We loved the casino and poker room. Our main reason for coming to Vegas was for poker and Harrah's did not dissapoint. We spent the majority of our poker time at Harrah's. They have a great deep stack tournament with an awesome structure. The staff and dealers were great; very friendly. The CWs were great in the whole casino but especially in the poker room. The casino itself is very big and we had a great time there. As food goes we ate at Toby Keiths (A- very good but the restaurant was kind of chilly. Good sweet tea, medium priced about $35 pre-tip for 2) Room service (C+ it was ok nothing special kind of overpriced for the quality. Same food as in the cafe.) The Range was excellent (A+, beautiful view overlooking the forum shops, excellent service. The meal was great, the steaks very tender, cooked perfectly and the sides were awesome. Also tried the spa for a nice massage. They were doing some remodeling in the lobby area but you couldn't hear any noise so it wasn't bad. They had some good specials going and the price was well worth it. Nothing very fancy but it did the job. The pool was a nice area to lay out and have some drinks. The bartenders were very good and quick. The pool isn't very lush or tropical; it is on the small side. I had a good time by the pool but it would have been better if it was bigger.

This hotel is connected to the monorail so if you want to go down to the south strip (MGM, NY NY, LUXOR) or the North Strip (Circus, Stratoshphere, Riviera) it is a very quick and inexpensive ride. In my opinion this is the best Casino is Las Vegas! They have different games than most of the other casinos. This casino is always lively and in the front their are some open doors so you can actually see outside. Right outside the door there is a big open bar and concert area that fun and always has a good band playing. And in the casino there is a lounge bar that has nightly piano acts that are fun to watch and free. The only thing that I can possibly think of that might be considered a draw back is the pool.

While this pool would be fine anywhere else it is not up to par with most of the other pools on the strip. The only restaurant we have ate at was the Cafe at Harrahs.

COUPONS COUPONS COUPONS - magazines in hotel lobby have tons of coupons. use them - you will save lots of money. 6. check out the Neon Musuem - http://www.neonmuseum.org/ 7. go to a CVS or other small store to get your alcohol. 12 oz bottle of miller light cost $3.50 at hotels and bars.

Best: beds Worst: Mini bar/Fridges. ** These fridges have about 4 bottles of water in them yet YOU CAN\"T USE THEM. I threw some pop in there when we arrived and i would have been charged for using the mini bar based on 'weight' - be careful - it looks like a fridge but it is a 'phony money-making fridge'. Don't use it! Harrah's -'You make a lot of money - let us use the fridges - you are paying for the hydro anyways!' Food: We ate one breakfast and one dinner at Flavors. It is buffet only. The food was good and there were lots of choices. it was convenient to just get in there and eat without having to wait - especially with the large group we had. We also had one lunch at the other restaurant - can't remember the name (not Ming's). The food was plentiful and good - but there is usually a line-up to get in. Also they advertised a lunch special - but once we were seated we were told it was not available on the weekend. The sign advertising the special made NO mention of this - a bit of false advertising? Gaming tables: Minimum bet required a bit too high for newcomers like us. Piano Bar and Toby Keith's bar - both fun. Pool: Nothing fancy -had lots of chairs, outdoor bar and towels. We enjoyed it. Checkout: LONG lineups. Internet charges to our rooms even though no one brought a laptop - watch your charges closely. Took us 40 minutes. Location: Great - centrally located - easy to use the bus or the rail system that comes through the back of the hotel. Price: Very good - Came in a package deal.

Free, through my Total Rewards players card. But I would stay here again even if I had to pay for it. We were in a remodled deluxe room with 2 queen beds and it was very nice, clean and modern with a limited view of the strip.

Price is inline with about every other hotel on strip. Not cheap anymore like old days! The only other place in Harrahs we ate was the 24 hr. cafe. They have good food anytime and the pizza pie is great after a night of drinking some beers! For entertainment we went to Toby Keith's bar. Even though I hate hillbilly music it was a good time with a good crowd and not bad drink prices. Also went to the dueling piano bar and watched the twin girls. Very entertaining! We also hit a country bar called Stoney's Rock N Country down by the Southpointe hotel. Again, not a country fan but wanted to go to a club for people of any age group and are not many of those left.

The whole place is in desperate need of updating, modernization, and a thorough scrubbing. It just feels like an old hotel. Saving graces of this place are the Piano Bar and the Mac King comedy show. Both were a lot of fun and great diversions. I understand the priority is keeping us in the casino but they can make more of an effort to make the rooms friendlier to modern travelers and a little more comfortable", "Date": "March 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wake Forest, NC", "Title": "\u201cTop 10 Reasons Not to Stay at Harrahs\u201d", "Author": "GBPackers-Lover", "ReviewID": "UR26168755", "Content": "10. Long Check-in Lines - We arrived at the hotel around 9:00 pm. There were five people in front of us and it took 35 minutes to check in. We were astonished that only two people were behind the counter. 9. Dated - Outside of \"Toby Keith's I Love This Bar and Grill,\" everything in the hotel is outdated: the rooms, casino, restaurants, etc. 8. Timeshare Salesmen - Harrah's places these salesmen right beside the elevators. This means every time you go to and from your room, you get heckled by them. They are rude, obnoxious, and treat you with sarcasm as if they are doing us the favor by heckling us. 7. Old People - It feels as if 80% of the people at the hotel are over the age of 60. Everywhere you look there are old people, many of whom smell. 6. Cheap Slots - I realize the economy has not been friendly to Vegas, but that doesn't mean you must make all the slots stingy. Don't bother playing at Harrah's, I would go over to Wynn or MGM Grand. You'll get more bang for your buck. 5. Slow elevators - It took longer to get to the sixth floor of Harrah's than it does the 20th floor at The Mirage. Let's speed it up Harrahs! 4. Pool - Where did they get this pool setup, Motel 6? 3. The Room - Tube TV, rock hard mattress, small shower, no view. 2. Fashion - Ladies, black shorts with black tennis shoes with white socks with a baseball cap does not look good. It's Vegas, not West Virginia! 1. Price, Price, Price - For the same price, you can stay at Treasure Island, Flamingo, Bally's, MGM Grand, Excalibur, and Luxor: all of which are far better. We paid $39.99 for this room, and if I had to do it over again, I would have stayed somewhere else.

We were on the side were the carnival club plays. It was not all that loud. You could hear it with the door closed, but is very muffled. Before going out, my party meet in my room, we opened the door and had a mini party in the room. Harrah's has the best comps in vegas. If you don't have a total rewards card, you need to get one. Our room stay was comped for three nights. During our stay we ordered room service twice, about $30 aa pop and that was comped on check out. The room service is from the Cafe downstairs, so the room was not that bad. My husband won $350 on the penny slots, that was a plus! The weather was great, it was about 70 during the day. At night you need a thin jacket. But, aynthing is better than the 300 degrees in the summer. Will never go to Vegas again in the summer, February was great. There wasn't a big crowd and you weren't pissed if you had to go outside for longer than 5 minutes. In September of 08' I stayed at Imperial Palace, so the upgrade to Harrah's was really nice. The stay at IP was wasn't that bad, I had an upgraded suite, but Harah's is much nicer. The bar tender in the Piano Bar at about 5pm on Saturday was not all that friendly and I paid for my drinks!!

Rooms were nondescript, average hotel rooms with a small self-programable safe. The casino was a bit aged and average with a theater featuring Rita Rudner upstairs. Harrah's had comp'ed our rooms due to our play in Shreveport/Bossier City so when we came to Vegas to watch our daughter play in a volleyball tournament, we stayed at their Harrah's location. Never spending the night in one of their facilities, we did not know what to expect. We were not dissappointed but were not wow'ed,either. The staff was very friendly and the dealers all had wonderful personalities. We only had breakfast in The Cafe, which was good and was also comp'ed at check-out, and service was excellent. The hotel/casino is located across the street from the Mirage, next to the Flamingo, attached by walkway to the Imperial and within walking distance to many other places on the strip. The traffic is a mess most of the time. One negative that I'm going to mention because I've never experienced anything like this in my entire life....There is a card in the bathroom that states \"Throw your dirty towels on the floor and we'll leave you clean ones.\" We've all seen the sign before...no problem. We left our dirty towels hanging over the shower. Just 2 of us, but I used a 3rd towel when I washed my hair. When we came in that night, our towels were gone and new towels were folded and back on the rack. After my shower, I pulled down a towel to dry off. And, surprise*surprise, there was my makeup (I hope it was my makeup!) on the towel I was drying off with! O-k, interesting. I looked at the rack and there were 4 towels. How were we (or anyone else) to know which one was my towel, my husbands, the towel for my hair...or the clean towel?...how would they know when we checked out? Would they wash them all? How would that save water? Were we using someone elses dirty towels? If we left our 2 dirty towels on the floor, would my dirty hair towel remain on the shelf folded for the next people since I didn't know which one it was to take down and throw on the floor??? Maybe I'm obsessing but I don't like thinking I (or anyone else) is using dirty towels..... Just FYI.... :( I honestly don't know what the price of rooms here are so I can't tell you if this is a good deal or not. It is not flashy or new but it is not old and run down either. The room is decent, the water was always hot, the food and service is good, the casino dealers are personable (which is a big plus... if they're going to take your money, you might as well have fun!!!!) and it's close to other places if you're the type to wander to other casinos.

Young partiers next door were really really really loud but finally left at 11:30 PM probably to go to the clubs. When I checked in, I was told by the clerk/reservationist who checked me in that I was entitled to a a \"freebie or coupon or a voucher\" something like that , where I can use any service within the hotel gift shops, restaurants, etc for up to $30 and I would be credited for it. I asked the clerk if he could give me a coupon or card to use for this. He assured me - all I would have to do is charge the service to the room, and when I checked out, they would deduct up to $30 of the charge from my final bill for the room. So the next morning, I went to the coffee shop and had a breakfast that totaled $17.50. Actually I really did not have much for breakfast, the coffee shop is not cheap. But I was getting this free, right? Well after the meal which I charged to my room, I quickly went back to my room and as I travel light, I was checking out within 5 minutes of leaving the coffee shop. When I dropped off my room key, the clerk told me I did not have any charges. Since I had pretty much just left the coffee shop, I told the clerk that I just had a meal that he probably would not see on his display, but it was charged to the room and was less than the $30 credit. I said that I wanted to double check with you that I would not be charged this amount on my credit card. He said that I wouldn't. Believe me, I would not have eaten breakfast at this hotel if I knew it wasn't free. I just got my credit card statement and they did charge me for it. I called the hotel and talked to the billing clerk and she said her manager told her to tell me that they can't refund my card, and that I would have to call Last Minute Travel to take care of this. This made no sense, but I did call Last Minute Travel, and they said that there is nothing they can do since they did not offer this comp/credit. Bottom line here, if you are offered this kind of extra or freebie, get it in writing or get a coupon, and if they won't do that, go up the ladder to hotel management if necessary.

Talked to the Manager, but was only able to get an 11th floor Premium non-smoking room for a smoker. It was better than looking at rooftop air handlers, but had to listen to jackhammers during the day at the pool and loud music until 2am from the outdoor bar at night. The 2 Jr. Suites were nice and clean. If you like cold showers these rooms are for you. Bath water was hot, but when you turn on the shower the water turns cold.

Very well located on the middle of the strip, easy access to the Monorail. I've been going to Vegas yearly and this was my 1st time at Harrah's, and would definitely recommend it.

Harrahs offered me two free nights in a deluxe room from using my Total Rewards card on the first trip (do sign up, they really do give you comps!). We stayed the first two nights at Imperial Palace and then moved next door to Harrahs. Changing hotels was no problem at all, just walked with our luggage next door around 11am. There was a pretty long line due to everyone checking out at that time but that was to be expected. Staff was not too friendly but not overly rude either. We were just happy to be able to check-in right away and not have to check our luggage at the bell desk(which is outside if you are looking for it). Asked for a strip view but staff said we would have to wait longer to get that so settled for a room on the 15th floor in the Mardi Gras tower. We had no view what so ever but the window was huge, it went from floor to ceiling and if you had something good to look at then it would have been nice. The room was on the small side but clean. We had two queen beds, a small table and chairs, the huge wooden cabinet that held a small tv and on one side had the ironing board and the other a small closet. The room also had a mini bar but don't touch anything unless you want to pay because its motion sensored. The bathroom was also small. The shower would not turn off each day and housekeeping had to come fix it. The sink wouldn't drain after washing your hands. The room layout was just very cramped. It was tight for two people, there is no way that I would suggest trying this room with 3 or 4 people. There are metal srips every few feet in the hallway and the housekeepers are constantly running over them with their cleaning carts and its very annoying when you are trying to sleep. They do not try and come in your room when you have the do not disturb sign up but you know they are out there! The elevators run fast and smoothly. They have seperate ones for the lower number and the higher number floors. The casino is fun, easy to find your way around. Did not see the pool since it was January. Did eat at the Flavors Buffet, thought it was pretty good. You will definitely find enough to eat, they even have sushi on the lunch buffet. Also ate at Harrahs Cafe, I think it was called. It was okay, good place to stop when you are in a hurry to move on to gambling. Did not have very much luck in the casino, mostly played in other ones. Warning on the Mac King Comdey Show...when you check in they will give you a complementary two free tickets coupon. It says that you only have to buy one drink per person for $9.99. Well the day we went Mac King wasn't there, they told us Dave Williamson would be taking his place and the total per ticket comes to about $14 a person once you add in the entertainment and beverage tax. So you get one drink during the show for that price. The show itself was okay. It was about 45 mins long. But you're in Vegas....have fun and enjoy yourself. I would have to say that my stay at IP was better than Harrahs, believe it or not! But I can't complain my nights here were free! Harrahs is a nice clean hotel which is in an excellant location so just use the room for catching some Zzzzz's!

The Cafe and Toby's restaurant's food and service was above average. The negative review is the casino itself. It is runned down. The slots are old, the chairs are stained which makes it uncomfortable to sit on. We chose to stand many times. There are not enough restrooms on the casino floor. We used the concierge service in Harrah's to book two tours. That service was below average. We left a message on the answering machine to have the person call us to book our tours and never recieved a return call. I recalled left a message , waited two hours and then recalled and got a live person on the phone. When I tried to put the charge on my room bill , the person said I could not because they are not connected to the hotel service. I could definelty tell, since this service was below average. The tour to Hoover dam was average but the tour guide for the Red Rock canyon was not very articulate and not able to give a well presented guided tour. Both tour guides were pleasant.

The room ended up being a 2 Queen bed room on the 12th floor facing the strip (view of TI/Mirage and its volcano). The room was wonderful. A 32\" LCD TV in the bedroom and another 15\" LCD in the bathroom. The beds were confortable and had crisp white linens. There was a minibar in the room and ample storage in the closet (inside the built-in cabinet). AC was quiet, but I ended up turning it OFF as it was cool anyhow and I prefer to open the window (to a small balcony) for fresh air. I had an issue with the TV (Stations were not programmed) and within 45 mins of calling housekeeping, a technician came up and fixed right away and showed me how to reset in case it did it again (it did). A bit later, the very nice maid knocked on the door to ensure everything was alright. Daily housekeeping was perfect. Lots of towels, soaps and other toileteries changed as used. The room was quiet, but I could barely hear my next door neighbour through the connecting door. Luckily, most people around that time were single professionals going to CES, so it was not an issue at all. There was no smell of any smoke at all in the room or hallways. Ate 3 times at the buffet and it was alright. Good choice for breakfast with all the usuals (including made to order eggs). Keep an eye in the Carnival court for a girl handing out $5 off coupons valid anytime. Casino itself was OK, but I mostly played at Bally's or Paris as the table minimums were $5 there, compared to $10 at Harrah's.

On arrival we were offered an upgrade to a Junior suite for $50 a night or $75 for a top floor Exec Suite with Jacuzzi and view of the Mirage volcano. As it was Xmas and we were there for 6 nights we opted for the Exec suite. Check in was fairly quick and the staff were friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is very central and within walking distance of pretty much everything on the strip. If you have tired feet there is also a monorail station at the back of the hotel. Some think the immediate area is a little \"off\" but apart from the McDonalds next door which does attract some undesirables (both prostitutes and lots of the flicky flicky men when we went) it's absolutely fine at any time of day. In the room we had a living room with a small coffee making/drinks station, a large bedroom with a king bed and a bathroom with jacuzzi, two sinks and a seperate shower. The living room had a sofa and a TV and a dining table and chairs. There was also a small bar type thing in the corner for coffee and with a min bar. The window had view over the strip looking towards the Mirage and the mountains. The bedroom had a large king bed with a big wardrobe, a safe and an iron. There was also a double corner window with views over the Mirage and up the strip towards the Venetian. We could watch the Volcano from our room. The bathroom had a jacuzzi bath big enough for two, a sink each with their own Gilchrist and Soames tolietries and a seperate toilet and shower. Overall I was very impressed with Harrah's. I was a little sceptical of Harrahs as it's less well known but i had nothing to fear. I'm not sure what the standard room is like but in my opinion I think I would prefer to pay for an Exec Suite here for roughly the same price as a standard room in some of the 4 star hotels. Aside from the room the hotel is just like many of the other casinos. The breakfast buffet is fairly average, but we only had it once as there were big queues and it's not really my thing anyway. We also went to the \"Toby Keiths - I love this bar and Grill\" in the hotel which was good, but a bit too TGI's for my liking. They bring your drink in a big jar which just seems wrong.

If a hotel is fab I rave about it. if it isn't that great, I still try to find some positives and prefer not to slate the property. Harrah's is a good strip hotel in a great location I stayed here as it was comped to me for my play in July of this year. I love the gaming facility here. It is one of the few casinos that has a $5 stud table. I stayed in the Mardi Gras tower in one of the newly done up rooms. Pleasant and comfortable with 2 plasmas (one in the bathroom - wish it was stuck on the opposite wall so I could watch more comfortably from the bath!). Big king bed with lovely linen ( huge fan of crisp white linen). My room was in the \"quieter\" section of the hotel but faced over the massive air conditioning system ( not noisy to me)- but also had a bit of a strip view ( not really but could see treasure island and the bell tower from the venetian and also the Mirage). I think this was better than being above the live music. And I was given the option at check in. Room service was good. With prompt and friendly service. Check in excellent with the room ready early. One always has to be prepared for the fact that in Vegas rooms may not be ready until late afternoon and that there are often long check in lines (these move fast).

We attended the 2 hour overview presentation with the strangest time share salesperson we have ever met - very low key and personal. After the tour of the Grand Desert property it came down to \"do you see yourselves doing this or not?\" and when we said no it was a very simple okay, let me show you to my manager and we'll get you on your way with your gifts - that amounted to $100 cash (supposedly gaming chips but they gave us cash) and 2 Rio buffets, valued at $51 when we redeemed them. We felt that we made out like bandits. Nothing wrong with time share, but can be an ordeal to talk to a salesperson - not this time! As far as Harrah's - I was very disappointed by how smoky and unpleasant the casino, especially in comparison to some of the other casinos. Even the older ones, like the Mirage, were easier to take. Obviously, people like to smoke when they gamble but not all facilities are set up to clear this out as well as others. However, we loved how convenient this hotel was to the rest of the strip - whether it was the other Harrah's owned properties like the Imperial Palace, Flamingo, Paris, Bally's or the Rio (shuttle runs between the properties) or the others like the Mirage, TI, Wynn, Venetian, Cesears Palace and the Planet Hollywood - a lot has changed since we were last in Vegas and we loved the central location. Plus, having the monorail at the back of the hotel (not too long a hike, like it is some other resorts) made it easy to get to Hooters & MGM on the south end of the Strip and the Hilton and even up to the Sahara on the north end. Be sure to check out the Deuce for transportation up & down the strip and to Fremont street/downtown - for $5 a 24-hour pass was an even better deal than the monorail with a further reach for explorers. Our room was very comfortable, even though it was only on the 5th floor of the Carnival tower - which meant NO view and some thumping and other sounds from the music on Sunday night late into the night, but not so noticeable Monday & Tuesday night of our stay. We were surprised to find it so clean and pleasant after reading some of the other reviews - this was a room that the desk clerk informed us had not yet been renovated so we had low expectations. But all turned out well and we were quite happy, the room was quite spacious and met our needs. I strongly recommend this hotel to anyone considering a lower priced option right on the strip - you will find the time share folk everywhere up & down the strip, just get comfortable with saying no, really, no - unless you want the freebies they are offering and are willing to play the game.

The overall stay was good. Check-in on Sunday afternoon was pretty quick. The staff was very polite. The room was fine, large although the armoire (which includes the TV) takes up significant space. I was in the Carnival Tower, and while the room was on the Strip side, it was only on the 5th floor so there wasn't a real view. A friend was in the Mardi Gras Tower on the 11th floor - he had a better view, but still not that great . As long as you don't expect much of a view there won't be a problem. I found the room comfortable - there isn't much to say. It was quiet - I didn't hear much activity from the adjoining rooms. Bathroom was large and the shower/water pressure and temperature were good; plenty of hot water in the morning when many people are showering. I had breakfast at the buffet one morning, and it was good. I had two problems here. First is that at night I could hear the rock band playing at the hotel bar that adjoins the strip. It wasn't loud, but could be heard - it might annoy sensitive people. It stopped about 12:30 to 1 am. This will only affect some rooms, and if you are on the other side of the Carnival tower or in the Mardi Gras I don't think you will hear it. Second was that the housekeeping did not replace the washcloths as they took them to be laundered. On the last day this left me with none, which I consider atrocious. When I called in the evening to get some (when I noticed) they didn't bring them up. But a second call the next morning was quickly taken care of. At checkout I was told that the laundry company that serves all the hotels didn't deliver to anyone. Even if that were true, the staff should know not to take the old ones if they have no fresh washcloths to leave. This was probably a one time issue and wouldn't stop me from returning. But it was an area that needs improvement. (I left a smaller gratuity, and a note, so the housekeeper will hopefully know better if it happens again.)

We asked to change our seat to a more interior one away from the machines. Also the ceilings are rather low...maybe this makes the smell worse. My eyes burned after a few hours in the casino and I developed a cough the following day. Why can't Vegas follow Atlantic City and ban smoking??

We checked in quickly and professionally, stay on the the 23rd floor of the carnival tower. Ordinary room, we where not offered an upgrade to the Mardi Gras tower, we would probably have taken it, but no matter. The room was average, somewhat dated and probably due to a remodel in the next few years to keep the hotel competitive. The only really thing I notice is the cabinet the TV sits in is rather obtrusive when the doors are open, if you get up in the middle of the night , be warned. The common areas where similar to the room, nothing that set them off either positive or negitive but dated and need of minor repairs. We ate at the 'The Cafe\" for breakfast one day, not really all that great, watery eggs, way too large of portions of mediocre food and a touch over priced for breakast fare. The casino is nice, but I think they all look the same, the wife is the gambler of the family, she didn't get rich but broke even for 4 days, I guess that would be winning. The best part of this hotel is the location, close to everything from the airport, monorail and other strip features. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, like I said nothing to really exceptional or negitive, your average strip hotel in this price range. One thing of note for new Vegas travelers, I have been going to Las Vegas for the past 15 years and I noticed this time in particular that the price of things is starting to climb more then usual, I bought a beer at one of the Luxor casino bars, $8, at Harrah's $6 was about the average and most meals seemed 30 to 50% higher then other vacation spots. Not being much of gambler this may be my last trip, other places in the country aren't quite this expensive, old vegas seems to be dying. That's all I know, I hope it helps.

Three years ago I came and consistenly fared well at Binions, Harrahs, Flamingo, MGM, Ballys. Most all of these casinos now deal 6 decks. You can get a 1 or 2 deck but with payout and rule changes. Blackjack now only pays 6/5 on the low decks(1-2) and you CANNOT double down after splitting( some casinos have exceptions-for now). At first, I thought I was just having bad luck but as the days followed and I watched other people, I noticed noone I saw winning at either slots or tables( and I looked at alot of tables). I was actually impressed by this- alot of people losing so consistenly...everywhere, not just Harrahs.

Never ever have luck gambling at Harrah's so we do tend to gamble our majority of time elsewhere but still gamble at Harrah's to earn some comps. The comp system at Harrah's is not good as other player clubs. Of all the hotels I've stayed at on the strip over the years, Harrah's is not my favorite in terms of nicest room I've stayed in.

There was no in between, you either had one after another, or you had to wait a half hour. All blackjack pays 6 to 5 instead of 3 to 2.

They had no $5 dollar crap games even during the week i.e Monday at 1pm. The buffet was average at best, all the standard food, but nothing too special. The crab legs are already cut in half so the meat is really dry and unedible unless drenched in artery clogging butter. For 20 bucks you can find something better. On to the room. Booked luxury room with a strip view, instead got a mini suite overlooking the pool. The room was very loud from the music at carnival court, earplugs did the trick and it wasnt an issue.

Check-in was great, but that was because we didn't arrive until late at night. As soon as we walked into the room my first thought was that we had been given a room that someone else was staying in! This was due to the fact that a room service tray full of half-eaten food was sitting next to the bed. In addition, there was water bottles, a lei, and other miscellaneous items from a previous guest left on the nightstands, armoire, and work table. The bed was made and the bathroom was clean however. Called the front desk and was told there was not another room to move us to, so they told us to contact housekeeping. Once we got over the shock of walking into a room full of someone else's food and trash, I was able to survey the room itself. The view wasn't too bad -- could see Treasure Island pretty clear, and the room had an itsy bitsy balcony you could go out on. When I mean itsy I mean it is barely big enough for you to stand on, but it was nice to get some outside air. The room was pretty small compared to other Strip hotels I have been in, but nothing below average. Nice plasma TV in the bedroom and bathroom, typical bathroom amenities, water pressure was terrible though! Bed was super comfortable. No real complaints with the room other than housekeeping which based on our initial problem and the fact that we left the room one day and came back to find our room partially cleaned -- we assume housekeeping cleans rooms in stages, as the maid tried to return later on to finish the job (which apparently they forgot to do earlier.) As far as the hotel itself, there is truth to others saying that Wyndham reps are everywhere -- I wish hotels would ban this it is so irritating, so expect to be pushed by sales reps often when walking around. The 24-hour cafe was not that great -- they serve breakfast 24/7 except oatmeal which we tried to order and were told 'because it is so late we don't have oatmeal' -- go figure...food was just so/so. Pool is definitely not much to write home about, plain pool (maybe olympic-sized couldn't tell), with a small bar/cafe. I wasn't lucky at all in the casino but it is fairly good sized. Ate at Toby Keith's I Love This Bar and Grill for the second time...food there is good, but you should expect the wait-staff to be nothing more than eye-candy and you won't be dissapointed. Prices are pretty steep. There are several shops in the hotel, and I was glad to see more than 1 stayed open late. I guess the problem with Harrah's is that their hotel is rather boring compared to others. Everything (casino, shops, restaurants) are just kind of standard....nothing great about the pool etc...basically I would stay there again if it was free, but would not dish out any money for the trip....have a much better time at Rio for sure!", "Date": "August 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel & location\u201d", "Author": "phillynathan", "ReviewID": "UR18320249", "Content": "Booked for a get-away last minute.

I was not expecting too much in the way of luxury or service, but I was wonderfully mistaken. We checked in late on a Wednesday night (about 10pm), and the desk clerk told us they were down to the last non-smoking room, so she asked if we wanted that room or to upgrade to either A) a full-blown suite for 1 night with guaranteed downgrade back to the basic room the last 2 days of our trip, or B) a mini-suite for 2 nights with the possibility of the 3rd night also. We chose to go with the mini-suite and ended up getting to stay the 3rd night after all! I couldn't believe it- our first Vegas trip and we got complimentary upgrades to a wonderful mini-suite. The room itself was very nice. It was on a low floor in the Carnival tower and was very quiet and easily accessible. It looked like it was fairly recently renovated as compared to other parts of the hotel. It had marble bathroom counters, floors, and shower features. There was also a lovely floor-to-ceiling closet feature with pull out TV. Also a desk and small table near the window. The space was lovely and had lots of room to walk around in. The bed itself- wonderful! It was a down bed with down pillows. By far the MOST comfortable bed I have ever slept on, and perfect for crashing after a long day on the strip. I honestly almost regret not spending MORE time in the room as opposed to out seeing the sites and gambling. Could never hear the neighbors and the cleaning service was great and the room always looked lovely. it also had a wall-safe, which made it much easier to feel safe leaving things in the room instead of lugging them around the strip. As for the rest of Harrah's- the Cafe was alright. Nothing to special, but hit the spot at nearly midnight. Starbucks was typical- exactly what it should be. The piano bar was loads of fun, and we never even went in- just gambled right outside so we could double up on fun and sing-along while playing the slots. Customer service was AMAZING. Everyone at the desk was wonderful to us. Room staff was great. The cab service was good. No complaints all around.

The rooms are all suite & very spacious. Went to Kokomo Restaurant at the Mirage- or attempted too. Sat down but were totally ignored by waiter so just had wine & left. With prices like that they should be treating you better or atleast acknowledge you. So ended up at the Italian Rest there which was very good esp their bread with olive oil/balsamic/garlic dipping. Went to PF Changs off strip & had the best service ever. Also ate at PARIS at the Burger Place which was yummy & great service too. I would like to stay next time at Paris- good size & nice casino area & shops. Went to the top of the Eiffel Tower which was kinda scary going up on the elevator but great views of the strip. We had to come right down due to lightening storm approaching but they gave us vouchers. Saw Cirque du Soleil MYSTERE at Mirage which was better than I expected.

Harrah's was recommended to us by friends who live in Los Angeles, and who visit Las Vegas on a regular basis. It's perfect location in the centre of the Strip should in theory mean you'll be paying considerably more for a room per night, but unlike the majority of hotel casinos nearby like Bellagio, Caesar's Palace and The Venetian, you're not. A lot is made of star ratings for hotels in Vegas. Caesar's Palace is rated as 5+ star, and personally I'd say it was higher. Harrah's thought is accurately rated as 4 star. The hotel is clean and tidy. The rooms are ample in size and we heard no noise from any adjacent rooms throughout our stay. We had a king size bed, large CRT TV, adequate bathroom with hair dryer but the air con was set so you couldn't adjust it. Maid service was once a day. Our bed was made with fresh sheets, bins emptied, bathroom cleaned and towels replaced. Also included was a mini bar - WARNING : Don't under any circumstances be tempted to open it. The stuff inside costs a fortune and if removed (even if not used and subsequently replaced) is automatically billed to your room. The guys manning the check in and out desks were prompt and curteous. The interior decor of the casino was perfectly fine. Not as lavish as the other bigger casinos, but when in Vegas you'll probably find you'll move from one casino to another. During our stay we tried the hotel buffey. Fair price, good selection, the quality of the food was great and free refills of soft drinks - can't fault it.

The junior suites are really nice, clean, and spacious.

It is perfectly located in the middle of the strip, and the Mirage is literally less than a 2 minute walk once you get outside of the hotel (and remember the Mirage is connected to Treasure Island, which is a really good hotel too). Caesars Palace and the Paris are only a 5-7 minute walk, and I would say the Bellagio is only about a 10, maybe 15 minute walk at longest. All of these hotels have great casinos, which is the only downside of Harrah's (their casino isn't that big and is confusing to navigate). If you're into nightclubs, the surrounding hotels have good ones, and if you're into fine dining, Caesars and the Mirage have excellent restaurants. Furthermore, Harrah's also has a great buffet-it was only about 25 dollars for dinner, and the food and the selection was excellent. The best spot at Harrahs, without a doubt, is Carnival Court. It is a huge outside bar that features live music starting around noon or 1 each day that goes all night. The atmosphere is relaxed and laid back, the people are fun and friendly (which is not the case everywhere in Vegas), and the live music was awesome (even the performers in the afternoon were good).

Great little casino next door Casino royale had a good few wins in their, cocktail waitress came round every 15/20 mins you only tip a $1 and for 2 g&t's and 1 brandy/coke (for 50p) i'm not complaining!! also saw phantom at the venetian WOW go if you can you will never forget it!! and also saw Legends in concert at the Imperial Palace great show for $30/40 at the moment they have Dusty springfield winner of the UK one and only get out quick at end of performance as all the stars will have their pic took with you . Check out was quick and easy (didnt get charged $5 for a toby keith bottle) and the luggage store was great as we had an afternoon flight back to the uk (Think virgin going down hill this was our 4 th visit to vegas and i can't remember service being that poor) but as they are the only direct flight people we dont have a choice. have stayed at sahara,excalibur and luxor and harrah's hotel for the location is def the best would stay here again on my next visit might sign up for comps next time may be they will give me a free room !! just for this review if you go here dont be put of by any bad reviews (you always get 1) have a great time in VEGAS enjoy", "Date": "June 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dundalk, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel ,wonderful location\u201d", "Author": "Irishairyfairy", "ReviewID": "UR17247549", "Content": "We had a wonderful 6 night stay in Harrah's.

I arrived early and found out that I had been placed in a newly renovated room. Unfortunately, the room wasn't ready yet - not their fault as I arrived 3 hours prior to check-in time. I was, however, offered a different room that was ready right away but the desk clerk advised me that the newly renovated rooms were very nice and she recommended I wait. I checked a couple of times over the next few hours and my room was finally ready exactly at check-in time. The room in the Mardi Gras tower was very nicely appointed but one of the smallest rooms I've ever had in Las Vegas. Nice big screen LCD TV, but no HD signal so the image was stretched. This is the second hotel I have stayed in recently where recent renovations included a large screen LCD TV but for some reason at the expense of drawer space. Nice granite top in the bathroom, great water pressure, and a smaller LCD TV mounted in the bathroom as well. Nice touch. The new bedding was very comfortable and the room was spotless each day. No working desk - just a cafe table with 2 chairs, but that's pretty much the norm in Vegas. Only problem with the room was that the internet jack was dead when I got to the room and I needed to get on-line quickly. First call to guest services resulted in being told that someone would be right up. Fifteen minutes later I called again and told them that I either needed someone immediately or they would have to switch my room as I needed to get on-line. Engineering was there in 5 minutes and corrected the problem on the spot. I was not facing Carnival Court but a colleague was. I stopped by his room and didn't even realize the band was playing until he opened the sliding door onto his mini-balcony and that's when I heard the music. He was on the 8th floor so either those who complained about hearing the music are either more sensitive to the noise than I, or the renovations addressed this issue as well. The thermostats do turn off during the day when you're not in the room, but then cool down pretty quickly once you enter. Obviously this has been an issue for some guests as there is a card in the room explaining that this does happen, and that the system somehow knows not to turn off at night when you're sleeping. I found this to be true - room temp while asleep was constant and comfortable. Flavors Buffet is great for breakfast, but as other reviews have pointed out go downhill for lunch and dinner in terms of selection and value for $$ paid. Range Steakhouse is a great space with a great atmosphere and service, but the food was only so-so. There are better steakhouses in town at the same price point. Carnival Court was a lot of fun, with two bands alternating and a great bar scene. The Piano Bar is also a lot of fun with Karaoke hosted by a Sinatra wanna-be from 6-9 and then dueling pianos the rest of the night. Great location center-strip and friendly, helpful staff.

I was at the hotel for 5 days. The hotel was just fine, nothing too exciting room wise. The check in people were hit or miss. The woman I got checked me right in and upgraded my room for no reason which was nice, but my co-worker got the shaft. He was told his room wasnt ready yet and he would have to wait. Luckily he wondered over to where I was checking in, about two stations away and when he told me he had to wait, my check in person asked for his info. She ended up checking him in right then. I dont know what the issue was with the first person. Other than that, we had no issues with the hotel, everything was just fine. The casino is just ok too. Really expensive drinks if you are not gambling, but its hard to want to sit at an empty table with $20 min for a \"free\" drink. I spent most of my gambling time at the casino's next door. I tried to watch a Red Sox game at the Sports Book, but the chairs are so uncomfortable you don't want to hang around. Of course the most comfortable seats are at the bar but you have to be playing video poker to sit....meh... I ate at the buffet the first day. Good selection and fine food. Nothing outstanding. It was Sunday when I arrived so the price was pushed up to $20 each opposed to the normal $16 because it was \"Brunch\". The deli (hidden between the Sports Book and the Poker Room) was the best food I had in the hotel and it was cheap too. One thing to note, the hotel as a deal with Pepsi, so if you need a Coke product you need to go to McDonald's next door. Overall nothing bad, nothing great.

I stayed there 2 nights last week during CTIA, and was very disappointed. I arrived at 3:00 a.m. local time on a Tuesday morning after flight delays from the East Coast. Check-in was stressful because the front desk person was reluctant to give me a non-smoking room, which had been reserved and guaranteed for me. The front desk person spoke to the manager, who did give me the non-smoking room. That was a relief but it took about 20 minutes when I was really tired out. One bright note about the hotel: the room itself was actually nice, clean and spacious. But Harrah's isn't an appropriate hotel for business travelers. You have to walk through a very smoky casino to get to the restaurants and to some of the elevators. Garish neon lights are everywhere. It was like staying in a bar with hotel rooms attached. The biggest bummer was that the pool was only open from 9:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m. Again, the hotel's just not for people who are traveling on business. You can smoke and gamble 24 hours a day at Harrah's-- but you can't get in the pool! Go figure! On a brighter note, one morning, we had breakfast at the Renaissance Hotel near the convention center-- and it was wonderful. The service was fantastic, food was great, and ambiance was truly relaxing. It was like an oasis in the insanity that is Las Vegas.

However, for paying guests, Harrah's is one of the most reasonable of the strip casino hotels in Vegas. The casino is loaded with popular games, the buffet is good, and the staff is friendly. Never had to wait for my drink to get empty with the cocktail waitresses. Most rooms overlook the eastern part of the city, or the service road, but who comes to the room to stare out the window? You can request a strip view, but might not be worth the price. The beds are comfortable and clean. Mini bar is a traditional rip off, and prohibits you from storing your own stuff. Good news is you can request a mini-fridge for free to be brought to your room. I was comped a king bed, strip view room for free, but when I checked in (early) I got 2 double beds, city view. It takes a lot for me to complain, so I just took the room and was happy. Bathroom was clean and functional, and the carpets and sheets were also clean. TV had many channels, and offered video check out. My largest complaint with this property is the AC system. It is on a sensor, which shuts off when you are NOT in the room, or sleeping. Thus, you often wake up in the night sweating, or return from a day of being in the DESERT SUN hot, only to find your room even hotter. I understand the need to save energy, but find somewhere else to cut back. Guests want their rooms comfortable. I think you can call the front desk, and if you get someone smart they can have an engineer put the thermostat on bypass, which gives total control back to you. I didn't try it, the weather was in the 50's at night this time, so I left the window open for cool, fresh air.

The location of Harrah's is one of the best on the strip. If you go out the front door of the casino there is a crosswalk that leads directly to Caesar's. Harrah's is right in the middle of a large complex of hotels and is on the monorail for easy access to other properties. Another good thing is that when you arrive (we came in a taxi) check in is right inside the door and the room elevators are just off the lobby, you don't have to drag your luggage through the casino. Check in was fast and easy for us and the room was ready when we arrived. We didn't get bothered by the time share people but if you are a male / female couple they will confront you which is pretty annoying.

We were there for a week. We thought that other hotels in the area owned by Harrah's were nice also. Ceasars Palace was the most impressive looking. We stayed in the C tower on 27th floor at Harrahs. Very nice view of the Mirage and the fountain and volcano in front. We even got to see the volcano erupting one night. It was impressive. The room was satisfactory. Nothing wrong with it. Maybe it could have used a few more electrical outlets. The bathroom was good, the mattress and bedding were good. Maidservice was good. We were satisfied with Harrah's all in all. A few hints and suggestions we have are: If you can't walk long distances, don't try to go to other hotels, it looks close but it isn't. Just getting from Harrah's to Ceasars Palace across the street is a long walk. You can rent a mobility cart at Harrah's. (Just like the kind you see at the grocery store only much nicer, smaller and faster) The carts are rented outside the front desk, see the bell captain. If you keep it for like 6 days its $125.00. One day is $40.00, two is like $75.00. So the longer you keep it the price goes down per day. It goes about 20 MPH at top speed and also can be adjusted for whatever speed you want to go. You take it to your room at night and park it and plug it in. It holds a charge all day long. I took mine to 5 different casinos with no problem. (My hip was giving me a problem) There is a shuttle you can catch outside of Harrahs that will take you to the Rio Hotel. From the Rio you can get a shuttle to Ballys, Ceasars Palace, Paris, and maybe one other Harrah's owned hotel, I can't remember. They run every 15 min on Weekends and every 1/2 hour on weekdays. These shuttles are all free and you can take your mobility cart with you. They have a lift and they put it right in the back of the shuttle and they put you on the shuttle first while everyone else has to wait to board. (Makes you feel cared for ya know) The gambling was not good at any of the casinos for us. We played slots ($1.00, 50, 25, nickel and penny. The most we won was $400.00.) We found that all the casinos slots were tight. We gambled at Harrahs, Ballys, Ceasars Palace, Rio, Imperial Palace, and the Venetian. By the way the Venetian is the most impressive hotel we saw. (Of course we didn't see the rooms) When you get to Vegas, take your GPS with you. The cab drivers will take you the long way to your hotel. Whatever you do don't tell them its your first time to Vegas. If you are going to Harrahs tell them you want to go via Paradise Blvd. That is the most direct route. We paid $7.00 more to get to the hotel than we paid to go back to the airport, after we were advised to tell them to take Paradise. Our GPS was packed in a suitcase. At the hotel, if you tell them you need a refrigerator it will cost you $30.00 a day. If you tell them its medically necessary, it will be free. We took a cab a mile and a half away to Von's grocery store and got beer and bottled water and snacks and stuff. Bottled water is $2.25 at the hotels and beer is anywhere from $6.50 to 9.00 a bottle. Except if you are in the casino. We had a great time at the piano bar at Harrahs, they have Karoke also if you are into that. The Mac King I think that was his last name.comedy magic show was hilarious, we rec\\ommend it. Harrah's gave us free tickets to the show, but you had to buy two drinks at a cost of $23.00. It was the cheapest show we saw, but the best. We also went to the Price is Right show at Bally's, it was a lot of fun. We saw the Blue Man Group show at the Venetian. Save your money unless you are in your 20's and love loud banging and strobe lights and toilet paper showered over your head. At $138.00 a ticket, we wanted a refund. The legends show with people imitating Elvis, Bette Midler, Ray Charles, etc. was also nice. You can get a discount equal to the sales tax in the shops owned by Harrahs if you are staying at Harrahs and you ask. I got a suede jacket at 10% off instead of the 8% tax because it was on a display. The plane ride was nice. The airport was not bad, security wasn't bad to get through. All in all except for losing thousands of dollars in the slots, we had a great time. By the way, the buffet at the Rio is a 1/4 mile long and is the best buffet we went to. The Oyster bar at Harrahs was the best also. Try the Broiled crab legs and the fried oysters. We were in heaven. the buffet at Harrahs was also nice.", "Date": "January 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "north carolina", "Title": "\u201cnothing to complain about\u201d", "Author": "pharmy1010", "ReviewID": "UR12967582", "Content": "We stayed here for three days over the Christmas holiday.

Well situated in the middle of the strip it\u2019s convenient for just about everywhere. Check-in was problematic, our room was not ready at the time of arrival and we had to make two additional trips to the front desk and wait several hours before it was. The Staff were apologetic and friendly but the inconvenience spoiled our day and was an unimpressive introduction to the hotel. When we finally got it, our room was large, adequately furnished and unremarkable in almost every other way. The larger than average bathroom, well supplied with extra towels, soaps and bottles was the only real positive. Unfortunately, this is a hotel with a serious identity problem. If Harrah\u2019s were a colour it would be beige. Surrounded by bigger and better hotels with well-defined themes and better facilities, Harrah\u2019s just feels dated and out of place. We got a ridiculously good rate on our stay so were not particularly disappointed at the overall mediocrity of the hotel. Had we paid the additional $200 that others who\u2019d booked later were charged we might not have been quite so forgiving. If you\u2019re lucky enough to get a promotional rate and don\u2019t consider your hotel to be a crucial part of your Vegas experience then Harrah\u2019s is an acceptable place to stay. If you\u2019re looking for style and creature comforts there are much better alternatives at a similar price. One final thought.

Supposed \"upgrade\" to premium room as a compromise was a complete farce. We were given an unacceptable remodelled \"closet-sized\" room (\"premium\" simply meaning a plasma tv vs. analog) with absolutely nothing to look at but another wing of hotel. Complaint results in complete attitude change of \"cheery\" check-in gal.... as well as a 3+ hour wait for decent sized room with limited view, but at least acceptable. #2. Casino needs a much-improved air ventilation for cigarette smoking. REALLY SMOKEY! If it bothers you, too...try Caesar's or the Rio! #3. Tried to dine at casino cafe for breakfast around 7AM on last day. No one in line; cafe less than 1/3 full ...and we are told we must wait until they clean a table. We left after 10 minutes..... CONCLUSION: Granted...our rooms were comped and we could have stayed for free at several other Harrah properties in Vegas, but we chose Harrah's Casino and Hotel due to the location. However, we feel that since we were INVITED to stay and promised a certain type of room, we should have at least received what we were promised. BUT...the biggest issue of all is the obvious sham they tried to pull on us regarding the supposed \"upgrade\". As a \"seasoned\" couple of players to other Vegas hotels, as well as Harrah's wonderful Grand Biloxi in Mississippi, this was a complete slap-in-the-face.

Check-in took a while even though there were not that many people and they had well over 10 counters opened. Got a room that looked out to the Imperial Place, so not much of a view to talk about either. Room size was adequate, but the lighting was terrible. Even with all available lights switched on, the room was so dim you should not attempt to read anything at all! The water pressure in the shower was also quite low and it will take you a while to get your shower done. We also found the bed to be too soft for our comfort, and it certainly does nothing to help stretch out your tired bones after a long day out walking The Strip. You should also beware the refrigerator, which clearly states that everything inside is monitored electronically and the second you remove any item, it will be charged to your account. Sadly, not the entire flooring of the room was carpeted, and even more unfortunate was the fact that Harrah's does not supply any in-room slippers. As such, in the middle of winter, should you wake up in the middle of the night and wish to visit the bathroom, be prepared for a freezing shock once your feet touches the floor. Location-wise, Harrah's offer a relatively good deal, though Imperial Place, The Venetian, Mirage, TI, Bally's, Paris, etc could all probably offer that. Moreover, the layout of Harrah's makes it rather difficult to get to the elevators to get to your room if you enter from The Strip as they make you walk through pretty much the entire casino floor and there are little directional signs to point you in the correct direction. However, if you are one of those who prefer to travel by the Monorail, the station is very conviniently located behind the hotel and you could easily exit the hotel on the 2nd floor and stroll under the covered walkway to the station. All-in-all, not much to rave about for an establishment whose reputation may be bigger than what it can deliver. Might return again if the deal is as good as the one I had.

Room - Very nice. Excellent condition. Had a good view of the Strip. Restaurants - Harrah's Cafe is very nice, and the food was excellent. Ming's Table is a chinese restaurant with very good food. The Range Steakhouse was also excellent, but it was way too expensive for me. Casino - Huge and adequate. Employees - Friendly. Noteworthy - Toby Keith's I Love This Bar and Grill. Best things about this hotel: Location. Monorail station. I was very happy with Harrah's, especially since I had the $45.00 per night rate.

Our room was located in the Carnival Tower rather than the newly renovated Mardi Gras Tower. The room was clean and without any problems. There were no stains on the carpet and the bathroom was very clean. The room had no odors, but the lighting was a bit dim. The beds are not the greatest. They are standard beds and in looking at the mattresses appeared to be either well kept or fairly new, neither had stains. These beds are not resort quality, but they will do after a long day walking and standing. The water spray on the shower was not the greatest and the pressure fluctuated quite a bit from toilet flushing or other users turning water on and off. The hotel provided the standard face soap, bath soap, combined shampoo and conditioner, body lotion and a shower cap. The room did have a free safe, a mini-bar with very over priced items, and a decent TV. Iron and ironing board included in the closet. The lower portion of the window does open for fresh air. The A/C-furnace does have a motion sensor that will shut off the power to the A/C-furnace when there is no movement detected in the room after a period of time. Our reservation was for a premium non-smoking room with a king sized bed. However, when we arrived at 4pm, the earliest you are supposed to be able to check-in, we were told that there were no non-smoking king rooms available in the premium section. We were given a choice of going to the Mardi Gras Tower to a king bed in a smoking room. We opted for 2 queen bed, non-smoking room in the Carnival Tower. The check-in clerk was very friendly and did say we could move the next day if we liked. She also said we would be getting a strip room view in the Carnival Tower. We were on the fifth floor. Our view was toward the strip looking out at a concrete wall with a very slight view of the very top of the Harrah's sign located out front of the hotel on the strip. So I guess you could say we had a \"Strip\" view. However, since our stay was not to hang out in the room, it really didn't matter. We did not eat at the hotel, but did gamble there. Understanding that you will always encounter smoke in a casino, I usually like to play were the hotel casinos have a good air exchange to minimize the smoke. In my opinion there was either little or no air exchange being maintained in the casino as it always seemed smoky. The staff in this hotel was very friendly and seemed to want to go out of their way to assist you. The parking garage is somewhat cramped, but we never failed to find a parking space up close to the hotel entrance. All in all we found this hotel to be adequate and the location can't be beat. You are so close to the Mirage, Venetian, Treasure Island, Flamingo and Caesars Palace. The Strip Tram is just a short walk to the back of the hotel and will take you to the MGM Grand or to the Sahara and all places in between. Just check for tram coupons in the magazines provided in the room for discounts on the tram rides. We did overhear other people checking in at rates of $250 for a Saturday and $200 for a Sunday night. That would be way too much to pay for these types of rooms. If you are going to pay those kinds of prices, stay at the Venetian or the Mirage.", "Date": "December 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cGreat mid-week deal\u201d", "Author": "4-ever-NY", "ReviewID": "UR11698740", "Content": "Mon - Friday midweek stay at rock-bottom rates of $45 most of those nights.

It was nice that we didnt have to wait till 3pm to check in. The location is wonderful. I sayed at Flamingo in September and thought that location was good, well Harrahs is even better, short walk from many popular spots.

Harrah's was the best priced, centrally located hotel on the Strip. We arrived at Harrah's at 12:30am after a long flight to find out that there was no room for us in the basic room we booked. We got a free upgrade for the first night to a full-size suite. However, we had to get up at 10am the next morning in order to \"check out\" and check back in again to the room we originally booked. This was annoying since we just wanted to get some sleep! So, we stood in a ridiculously long check out line and got our new room. Well, after staying in a suite you just cannot go back to a regular room! The room just didn't have the same amenities and luxury that the suite did so we went back downstairs and upgraded and paid the difference. They probably upgrade in the hopes that other people will do this! The suite had 1.5 bathrooms, a king size bed, a living and dining room as well as a minibar. The bed was very comfortable with high quality linens. The bathrooms were well stocked with towels, shampoo, soaps, etc; Housekeeping was great and came everyday. The view was great, we faced the Mirage. The food at Harrah's was okay. We got room service late at night one night and it was a bit overpriced and of average quality. We frequented the McDonalds next door and the Starbucks in the lobby for breakfast! We didn't play too much in Harrah's because we found the slots to be very tight. Instead, we opted to use the free shuttle to the Rio and we also played at other casinos on the Strip. I didn't find their comps to be as good as some of the other casinos either. The pool area was average. We really had to wait around to get the chairs with the misters. They need more of those! The pool was very basic... it served it's purpose well in the heat!

It was like being in a cave! We slept there 1 night and I asked to be moved. (We had no idea that they were renovating to the extent that they are) Since they had no junior suites available, they just gave us a standard room on the 29th floor. I must say it was wonderful to be able to see outside, and to actually be able to tell where we were! So, getting past that, the beds at Harrah's are WONDERFUL! I'd love to have one that comfortable at home! The housekeeping staff did a GREAT job! The staff in the restaurant where we had our breakfast every morning was very nice. The location is perfect. You can easily walk to many other places. I'm sorry to say that we didn't get to eat at Toby Keith's restaurant, but it looked great! Two things that may be worth passing on are (1) the check-in desk that they say is at the airport by baggage claim is no longer in existance, and (2) Harrah's has a complimentary shuttle that will take you to any of the other Harrah properties (we didn't find this out until the day before we went home)........plus you can get a complimentary bus to Sam's Town (a great place to go). You just go out of the lobby doors and walk past valet and cross the driveway. We went over to Rio on the shuttle to check out their pool (since Harrah's was closed) . Las Vegas has changed so much since we were last there. It's much more crowded......just walking down the street was a challange at times. All in all, it was a pretty good time. I'm sure, when Harrah's gets all renovated, it will be a REALLY great place to stay.", "Date": "November 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cThey had to move us, but customer service was wonderful\u201d", "Author": "ChicagoChris", "ReviewID": "UR10671203", "Content": "We knew about the problems that Harrah's had been having before we went there, but were ensured we would have a room.

There's even a TV in the bathroom!! Room had a safe and an iron, which are both plusses in my opinion. The sports book at Harrah's was probably my favorite on the strip. They have table games (blackjack, etc.) right inside the book, so you can gamble while watching the games. We only ate at the buffet, so I cannot account for the other restaurants. The buffet was really good for the price. A wide variety, and everything was good. I like how the casino was on the smaller side, so it was very easy to find your way around.

This hotel clearly has fallen way, way behind the standards of modern Las Vegas and I just don't see any reason to stay here unless you are getting an incredible price and/or really need to be in this physical location (though there are better options nearby). It is on the Las Vegas monorail system, which is handy, and the hotel staff seems nice enough. For starters, this hotel has a tired physical plant that appears to date from the late 70's or early 80's. You're getting none of the excitement of modern Las Vegas, but you are getting the noise, smoke and jumble of a crowded, kitschy, inefficient casino and public spaces. I can't comment on the food because after checking in I spent as little time as possible in the hotel itself. I stayed in this hotel for a trade show. My room was unavailable due to construction (though I made the reservations 6 months in advance I wasn't notified until 48 hours before I left home to arrive here). I was put in another hotel for a night, then when I moved into Harrah's I had to wait in line for an hour to check in because they were still sending people away. They put me in a very grim room when I checked back in; and when I complained they finally moved me into a better room. The \"better\" room I got was a typical Vegas hotel room -- nice enough -- but suffered from extremely poor soundproofing. My first nite in the hotel I was awakened by the guests next door talking and watching tv (at normal volumes) until 3 in the morning...the next night I was awakened a 5:15 in the morning when a different set of guests rose early to catch a flight (which I knew since I could overhear every word they said).

I told her it was a very limited view, and she offered to change our room for us, but we declined as we loved the room too much to move. The room was very quiet, never heard anything. It was cleaned very well each day as well. We did not order room service (however usually we do) so I do not know it that is still up to par. It always had been in the past. Check out was very quick as well. We always stay at Harrahs and it was quite a decision this time as now Harrahs owns so many prime properties in Vegas.

(August 11 through August 18). Since we were staying for a week, I knew we had to be fairly budget conscious and I was thrilled when I happened upon a banner ad offering room rates for $59 a night for weeknights. It took me directly to Harrah's website where I quickly found a great deal for their center Strip location. Their site was easy to use, showed photos of the rooms, available dates, etc. They accepted a deposit and have a decent cancellation policy, so I figured if I found a better deal elsewhere, we had up until 72 hours prior to arrival to cancel the reservation and get a full refund. When we arrived at the airport, we headed straight over the the Harrah's check-in counter, which is awesome. You can check in right there and avoid lines at the hotels for any of Harrah's properties, except maybe Imperial Palace. It's generally quick and easy. We hit a little snag when trying to pay for the remainder of the week. I completely forgot about the security deposit required at check-in and, unfortunately, the credit card I had planned on using did not have enough credit limit left so, after some help from a patient employee, and a couple calls to American Express, we moved on with the process. It ended up being about a $1200 charge between the remainder of the balance due and the deposit, which we thought may be a little high. It turned out that the deposit was more than the cost of the room, but we were sort of over a barrel there. Anyway, we've always wanted to try that \"tip the guy at the front desk for a better room\" thing. And we did. And he gladly accepted and gave us a room that he said has a great Strip view. Let me start out by saying, I didn't have very high expectations of our room. Honestly, for $59 a night, I was only looking for a clean, comfortable place to sleep a few hours and shower and plan our day. Well, we got to the hotel, got up to our room and planned on waiting for the bellman to bring our luggage and then head out to find some poker. To my dismay, we walked into a room with a great view that was also a smoking room. Ick. When I originally booked, I specified non-smoking, but forgot to mention it to the guy at check-in, so that was my mistake. The bellman got there very quickly and we explained that we needed a non-smoking room and he called down to the front desk and then told us he was moving us to a room on a different floor with the same view. He was very helpful, speedy and friendly. The room we ended up in was pretty much what I expected, it was clean and not very large, but comfortable enough for the time we'd be spending in it. The only thing wrong was the bathtub had a slow drain, which later in the week turned out to be a clog that was cleared by housekeeping. We never even mentioned it as it wasn't that bad, just a bit slow. The view was great; we looked out at Mirage and got to watch the volcano from it. While at Harrah's we dined in their cafe restaurant where the food was pretty good. They had a decent selection, but we stuck mostly with sandwiches, etc. We ate lunch at Toby Keith's I Love This Bar once on a whim on the way to the monorail station at the back of Harrah's, and were truly impressed with the food. We'll probably eat there again. Generous portions and it was very tasty. We ordered room service and they sent up the wrong sandwich the first time and the second sandwich was still prepared incorrectly, so we called and they took it off the bill, but they came back up and demanded the first sandwich back. I guess they thought we were trying to pull a fast one or something. That person was really the only unpleasant one we encountered. I visited the pool almost everyday while my husband slept in, and while it was nothing special, it was cool and clean. It's located on the second floor, so you don't have to go traipsing through the casino to get to it. The drink service was pretty quick and they have a little shop (which I'm sure is common at pools in Vegas) for people like me who forgot the sunscreen. Most days there seemed to be plenty of chairs available, but I found it's best to get there early or you might have to wait a few minutes. Overall, I'd say Harrah's was a pretty good value. Their rooms are adequate for someone just looking for a place to keep their luggage, sleep, shower and make plans. Another plus for their location is the monorail station. You can get up and down the entire Strip using it and it's emissions-free!

We have stayed at the Monte Carlo, Mandalay Bay, Flamingo and Ballys in the past. I have to say that overall, for the price paid, this was our favorite hotel. What impressed us the most about Harrah's was how friendly and helpful the staff was throughout the hotel. From the moment we checked in to the time we left we never experienced a grumpy or indifferent employee. We stayed in an average room, and we certainly aren't high-rollers, but I felt like one all of the time. The room was cleaned promptly every morning and it even had a coffee pot! (I won't even go into how I dragged mine all the way from Wisconsin). We were in a room on the 19th floor, Carnival Tower, with a limited view of the strip. The room did a have a small bar/fridge that we purchased beer/pop from a couple of times. A bottle of beer was $5.00, which I feel is pretty reasonable when you are beat and don't feel like going out to get one. We did ask for a fridge for meds that I like to keep cold, which they brought and set up very quickly. We walked to a small store, right next to Battista's Hole in the Wall restaurant, a couple of times to buy beer, pop, and snacks. The elevators were quick and they had someone checking room keys at night. The pool was nothing fancy, as reported previously, but it was adequate for my needs. The thing I really liked about it was that I could be there quickly from the room, no wandering all over the the hotel to access it. There was a small bar and shop there which I never used. There are a number of restaurants to choose from, but other than going to the buffet for lunch one time we never used them. We had considered trying the Range Steakhouse, but ended up going to Morton's Steakhouse on Flamingo Road instead. (A great choice for a truly wonderful dinner). There were two Starbucks, one on the main level which was always very busy ,and one just up the escalators on the second floor which nobody seemed to notice so it was never busy. The casino was always active and the drink service was very good, especially early morning, which is my favorite time. We didn't win any money there but had a lot of fun playing the Goldfish and Quick Hit machines. We aren't table players so I can't comment on those. Actually, we lost money everywhere this time but even that didn't deter from a great trip. The only thing we would do different next time is to walk over to the Mirage to watch the football games, which my husband really likes to do. The sportsbook was very small and not too comfortable, so when we walked over to the Secret Garden we noticed the Mirage's was huge and very nice, but easy to get to from Harrah's. We didn't rent a car, we rarely do, and had an easy time using the Duece bus a lot. Maybe it was the time of year, September, but this was the first trip that using the Duece wasn't a huge pain in the you-know-what. The drivers were even friendly, maybe they are cleaning up their act?. In closing, we really liked Harrah's and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.

We stayed at Harrah's and I had made the reservation through the Allegiant airline as a package. Next time I would call the hotel directly, so I could make requests. The only requests I could make through the airline website when I booked was smoking or non, and 1 or 2 beds. We were able to check in about 9:00, and I asked about a newly renovated room but she said they would be noisy as the band below plays until 3:00 a.m. so we decided against that. I asked for a strip view but she had none available so that was disappointing. We had room #2854 in the Carnaval Tower with 2 queen beds and non-smoking. Nice room and the beds were extremely comfortable. We did have somewhat of a view, although not of the strip, but at least it wasn't the roofs of some other buildings. Nice to see the mountains in the distance. Unfortunately we had a connecting room. TRY TO AVOID THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR NEIGHBORS!! We never heard a sound from the opposite room, but the one with the connecting door you could hear every word they said and every sound they made. I use ear plugs at night so wasn't bothered, but my husband heard them. Also, the first night he heard what he thought to be a pimp and a \"working girl\" outside our room. He was \"explaining\" some things to her in great detail. Again, I had ear plugs in so heard nothing, thankfully. We didn't win anything in the casino. My husband thought the slots were pretty tight as usually you will win a few credits now and then, but these machines just took your money and didn't even say thank you.

I asked for a renovated room and they accommodated. The clerk said the ONLY renovated rooms are in the Mardi Gras tower. So apparently Carnaval Tower is not renovated yet. Clerk asked if we wanted to be near the noise (Carnaval Court which is a fun bar between Harrah's and Imperial Palace) or away from the noise with a partial Strip View. We chose the strip view and had a view of Mirage and the Volcano, TI and part of the Venetian. The renovated room was great. Not overly large but all we needed was a bed and table. All new furniture and wall and floor coverings. Bathroom was big enough with a large enough counter for her stuff and mine. New flat screen TV in the room and a flat screen wall mounted TV in the bathroom. (ESPN while shaving every morning) Room had a new wall mounted safe and mini-bar. Didn\u2019t use the mini-bar but the $5.00 per beer was no worse than what you would pay elsewhere in LV. Our room on our side of the hotel also had a little balcony. Doors opened and you could step outside. It was only about 18 inches or so deep but enough room to stand on and enjoy the view. Harrah's is mid-strip, across from Caeser's Palace, so very convenient to walk in either direction. Casino is very active and cocktail service was excellent during our stay. We ate one night at Toby Keith's I Love This Bar & Grill and enjoyed the food. BBQ chicken wings were great and a huge portion. There is a Starbucks across from TKs where we got coffee each morning and it is only a few steps from the pool. If you are contemplating Harrah\u2019s be aware that the pool area is small.

We had received offers through the Total Rewards program in the mail since using our player's card there May 2006, but those offers had expired by December 2006. So, my husband contacted Harrah's this past February and asked what kind of deal we could get, even if we couldn't get two mid-week nights free. They offered us the unbelieveable deal of $40 a night and we scooped it up! So the moral of the story is, it doesn't hurt to call the hotel for any unadvertised hot deals. Be sure to have your Total Rewards card number available if you have one. So, considering what we paid per night, understand that our expectations were quite simple. Upon check-in at 4 PM, we asked about getting a renovated room and were told none were left. The woman wasn't rude, just matter-of-fact about it. We didn't complain, but instead decided to check out the room to see if it was acceptable for what we'd paid. We were pleasantly surprised with our room. We stayed at 752 Carnaval Tower. It was a bit of a walk from the elevator and there wasn't a view (see photos) but we are healthy and don't much care about a view when we spend so little time in the room anyway. The hallways on our way to our room were pleasantly appointed, well-lit and the carpets very clean. And it was so quiet--surprising as the casino was hopping at all times we were there and we understood the hotel to be quite booked. No smoking allowed on this floor either, so the hallway was very fresh smelling. Our room was slightly smaller than a room we'd stayed in at the Aladdin a few years back but decently appointed. It appeared that the furniture was new (although older television with so-so reception and limited channels). The drapes and bedding appeared to be recently updated as well. The carpet was a bit older-looking but very clean. My feet were clean despite walking around on the carpet in my socks one morning. The entryway had a full-length mirror which I appreciated and the flooring there and in the smallish bathroom was marble. Appeared to be new. The bathroom had only one sink but was very clean and shower flowed well with good pressure that you can adjust (waterpik-type nozzle). No tv in this room--but again, I didn't expect to get the best room in the place at the rate we paid. And according to other reviews I've read, we could have gotten much worse. Nothing super-fancy, but pleasantly clean and comfortable. We couldn't hear any noises outside the room, despite our room overlooking the valet/parking garage area which was very busy at times. Speaking of comfortable, the bed was heavenly. I always rave about the Sheraton beds and that nothing can compare, but this room's king-size bed was absolutely wonderful!! Comforter and sheets were immaculate. Our only suggestion about this bed would be to provide larger pillows. These were the tiniest bed pillows I've ever seen. There were three, but I would suggest bringing your own comfy pillow if you are a pillow connoisseur as my husband is. (It didn't bother me after the first night.) Since I prefer to hang most of our clothing-- I ran out of hangers in our room's armoire. We contacted housekeeping and they promptly (within 15 minutes) arrived with an assortment of additional hangers. I was very happy with housekeeping service throughout our stay (we tipped $20 at beginning of vacation and another $10 at end of vacation). As for the rest of Harrah's...we mostly played the slots. We had fun on the Wheel of Fortune quarter slots but didn't win anything. A lady celebrating her 70th birthday there with her extended family did win big two slot machines away from me after only about 5 minutes of play. She won 10,000 credits or $2,500 on the Tabasco quarter slot machine--it's largest payout. It was very exciting to watch someone win and be so surprised/thrilled. I did get the feeling that there wouldn't be any other big winners that week in that section of Harrah's there--but who knows?? I am very nervous about the gaming tables, but since it was our third time in Vegas I felt compelled to at least make the attempt to learn how to play one of the card games. We visited the Party Pit section at Harrah's and sat down at an empty blackjack table with a friendly-looking dealer. My husband and I each purchased $100 in chips and got started. She was very helpful, explaining the basics of the game and I believe that it would have been a pleasant experience had she stayed. However, a few minutes into playing she left and was replaced by a fast-talking smooth kind of dealer who intimidated me. In hindsight, I realize I should have stood up and taken my chips elsewhere but I knew my husband was having fun learning how to play and I didn't want to wimp out. However, minutes later I was feeling overwhelmed and miserable. Every time I wanted to hit or stay he'd intimate that \"the book\" says to do otherwise and get me to go against my gut feeling (again, this was my fault I know), quickly ridding my of most of the chips. I ended up giving the last $20 chips to my husband which he lost as well a bit later. (He seemed pretty easy-going about it, not upset like me.) Did I have fun? Not really. Would I do it again?? Maybe. Next time I would be more confident to go with my gut feeling and to leave when I don't feel comfortable with the dealer or the table. So it was a good lesson, although a bit expensive. (I did win at penny slots twice during the week which made up for the loss--that helps a bit too!!) We purchased coffee at the Starbucks in Harrah's a few times. The cheese danish and croissants were fresh and tasty. Expect a line in the AM and expect to pay through the nose for your java. Not a big deal to us, as we'd saved so much on our room (and airfare). As for the Flavors buffet, we used our comp points that last morning for $8 of our meal and used a buy one/get one free coupon for the rest (received the coupon while out strolling one day). I believe we were at the lunch buffet ($16.99). Good selection of food. Nice carving section especially. I didn't feel poorly a few hours later as some other buffets in Vegas have done to me in the past. Show at Harrah's that we have enjoyed each of our three trips to Las Vegas is The Improv. A reasonably priced evening for sure. I believe it was about $70 for the two of us. All the comedians we've seen there have been very good, some outright side-splitting funny. We didn't take advantage of the Mac King show in the PM, which are the tickets we were offered free (except you'll each have to purchase a drink for $9.95). Heard that it's a family friendly funny show that's at 1 pM and 3PM. We were always busy at those times and didn't get a chance to go. Well, I hope that my review is helpful. I would stay at Harrah's again (especially for the rate we paid!) for it's lexcellent mid-strip location, \"looser \" slots and decent accommodations. We also saw Mystere, Danny Gans and Vinnie Favorito during our stay, all within a few minutes walking distance from our hotel. We also really enjoyed the Margaritaville just south of Harrah's and Flamingo's penny slots. (Another Total Rewards member casino). We dined at The Treasure Island Steakhouse restaurant the evening we saw Mystere, incredible food (at an incredibly high price) but our one splurge meal of our trip--very worth it. Only two minor complaints--a bit smoky in casino at slot machines at times (Flamingo's is an excellent alternative if you are very sensitive to that) and pillows very small.", "Date": "August 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gaylord, mich", "Title": "\u201cWe Loved Harrah's!!!!\u201d", "Author": "vacationdreamer11", "ReviewID": "UR8408187", "Content": "We arrived at Harrah's about 3 in the morning.

We picked Harrah's because they offered $25 food/beverage certificate, 2-for-1 entry to their comedy show, and free admission to the spa. We also chose this hotel because of its center-strip location, and easy access to the monorail. Check-in was super smooth and easy. We were able to choose between two rooms in the Carnival tower, so I said \"whichever is nicer\". We ended up in room 644. It didn't have a view of the strip, but it was very clean (no mold or other funk) with plenty of towels. The only thing it was lacking was a fridge, but that wasn't a major problem for us. After 9PM you can only use one set of elevators, and you must show your key card to the security guard. The first night it was a little annoying because I didn't know where the proper elevators were, but after that it was OK. I appreciated this extra security feature. We didn't get to use the pool because our days were completely packed. By the time we got back to the hotel the pool was closed. Later we found out that it closed at 7PM every day. I thought it was a little weird that it closed so early, but since I didn't have time to use it, it ended up not being an issue. Checkout was a breeze as well. All room charges were fully explained and all of the people I talked to were extremely polite.

I called the room maintenance. But guy showed up after almost 45 mintues. By the time, I already took my shower with almost cold water. When we checked out, lady asked me about my stay experience and I told her, it was not that great just ok. And she asked my why just ok? I told her my shower experience.

For the price we paid it was indeed a good deal. Room was clean, bed was extremely comfortable, room safe, fridge stocked with stuff (but don't dare buy any....too expensive). As mentioned our only complaint was the lighting in the bathroom, it was minimal and made getting ready a challenge. Thank god I don't really wear makeup since I couldn't see to apply it if I did! Staff were courteous and offered us the possible opportunity to switch rooms should we feel necessary (our room was intended for handicapped patrons). Casino offers a variety of table games & slot machines. Daily poker tournaments if that's your game but bring a sweater since the room is cold!! We cannot comment on the restaurants available within Harrah's since we chose to eat elsewhere so we'll leave that risk up to you to find out. Pool is very basic and plain but serves the purpose of getting refreshed and taking a break from the Vegas heat! Overall we were quite happy and indeed would return if the price is right. One thing we would also like to pass along, if you are planning to take in a show or two look into buying tickets at 'Tix4tonight' as they offer a variety of shows at a discounted price.

The view was of the rear of the property facing IP. Not very pretty during the day but the night-time view was nice. My only complaint would be that it felt very, very far from the elevator and ice/snack/soda machine room. It was down a very long hallway and around a corner. After a long day of walking the Strip it feels like walking another city block to get to the room. I will make it a point to ask for a room closer to the elevator next time. Casino was fun but a little confusing to navigate at times.

We usually travel to Vegas about once a year and like to stay on \"The Strip\". This hotel caught our eye do to the price and location. It's right in the heart of the action and it's an easy walk to the Mirage, Caesars, Flamingo and many others. It's also very close to Jimmy Buffets, which is one of our favorite hangouts. We aren't bigtime gamblers. Our time is spent drinking a few beers, hanging by the pool and enjoying our friends company. This doesn't mean we don't gamble but it's just not our #1 priority. This is a little info regarding the hotel: We arrived @ the hotel @ 9:00 a.m. on a Friday and was pleasantly surprised that our room was ready along with rooms for the other two couples that came with us. No extra charge for arriving early and our bedding requests were met. Our room was on the 11th floor in the Mardi Gras Tower. Quick elevator service and the hotel hallways and rooms all seemed very clean. Carpets appeared updated and plush. Our room was adequate. Nothing special but it seemed rather dark. Open the blinds and what a view (NOT!). Hello rooftop AC ducts and some other building that I have no idea what it was. Oh Well! who the heck cares about the view? We don't use our room for picture taking. This is a place to lay our heads and feel safe in doing so. This was never an issue. We took advantage of the free safe but didn't use the mini bar. If you don't want to be charged for it don't even look at it. Bed was comfy. Showers were hot and TV worked. Channel selection was weak but again...who comes to Vegas to watch tv? Head down to the pool and just realize this isn't the Hard Rock or Caesars Palace. It's just an average pool with a few cabanas and 2 sun decks. The pool bar was expensive but I'll tell you a little secret......there is a liquor store right next door to the hotel. Just head outside towards the strip to where the bands perform and take the walk around the shops and there it sits. You can buy beer, liquor and snacks and it will save you a ton of money. When you walk outside towards the strip you want to head left towards Imperial Palace. If you go right towards The Wynn you will not find a store for atleast a mile. If you like to hang out and hear some decent entertainment head over to the pavilion bar. This is a cool little spot with awesome bartenders and local acts that are aware that they aren't ever going to be on Billboard's Hot 100. You can get within touching distance of them. They are very crowd friendly and often speak to the patrons asking for suggestions or requests. Get there early on Friday or Saturday nights and you'll avoid the cover charge that comes later in the evening. The casino floor is very large and a bit Old School. Harrah's looks to cater towards a slightly older crowd but does have a cool gaming area called the \"Party Pit\". This is where we played and it isn't because we think we are cool. The dealers on these tables are there to have a good time and help you succeed. In my experience, losing money to a friendly dealer is always more pleasurable than losing it to some stiff. If you fall within this line try the Party Pit. We didn't win much but we had a great time. Overall, we thought Harrah's was a great value. You have a lot of choices in Vegas but if you just want a nice place to chill out and relax then Harrah's will be perfect. If you want pampered and need a young hip scene then this place probably isn't for you. We'd certainly stay here again.

We were in the Carnival tower. The room was average but comfortable. The bathroom was a good size. The room was clean and maid service was efficient. I was disappointed in the casino, there were very few video poker machines. The health club was somewhat limited but the steam room and whirlpool were excellent. The breakfast buffet stood out as well above average in selection and quality of food. While I would not go out of my way to stay there again, I know it would be a safe bet if I return. One last thing. We saw Rita Rudner. Her show was perfect. She is a funny and classy lady. It was well worth the price of admission. When I inquired at the box office I was told they only had a few seats left. Not wanting to miss out I bought them right away: $57 each. We were seated in the back of the room and there were well over a hundred empty seats. The folks we sat with told us $99 VIP tickets were available at the half price ticket place. I felt a bit taken. Then five minutes before show time the Maitre-d asked all of us in the back rows to move up forward because the VIP seats were empty. We sat in the third row.

After arriving after 8pm it was hard to find 2 rooms with a view of the stip close to each other. The front desk staff went above and beyond. The first night we were on the 3 rd floor in the MG tower with plans to move the following day. Take note, the water pressure is excellent down there. Our room had a patio adjacent to the sun deck. You can hear some music from the pool but it wasn't enough to bother us. Our friends room was way down and accross the hall had no view much less a deck. The window was totally blocked by AC equipment. When I return I will ask for a patio room. We moved to the 12th floor in MG tower. It was basically the same room (not the renovated rooms but still nice). We had a view of the strip and the volcano and were much closer to our friends. The down side was the lack of water pressure. We really enjoyed the Carnival Bar during the day. It was a little too hip for us in the evening. The dueling piano bar was great and we loved the bands at Toby Keiths place. We also enjoyed a band at Margaritaville. The only place we ate at Harrahs was Toby Keiths, it's a little pricey but we the food was good. We had a breakfast at Ellis Island. The price was right but had to wait. It's a little dark and the service wasn't great. Afterward we walked to 7-11 and bought bottles of water for .79 to last the duration of our trip. If you cut through Ballys it's not a bad walk. Harrahs was just our speed. The price was great, we booked on the hot deals on their website, averaging to $80.00 per night. The rooms are nothing special but clean and the location cannot be beat. We liked the size of the casino, it wasn't hard to find eachother. Early in the day we walked to Casino Royal (low limits) so I could TRY to play craps but did most our gambling at Harrahs. We won enough at VP to pay for our trip so we left smiling.

The marble & granite in the bath were nice touches, but I would've preferred more room, a tub that drained, more water pressure, and a lighted makeup/shaving mirror, instead of a 2nd (small) flat screen TV.

I think a couple slots and that was it. People told me the outdoor area with the bartenders was really cool, but we never got to check it out.

My plane from Detroit was delayed for two hour so I did not arrive to the hotel until 1:00am Tuesday. Since I had little time in Las Vegas, after checking in which went very smoothly, I went to my room and unpacked. The room was clean and I especially like the armorie that was centered between the two beds. My original request was for a king bed, but arriving at the time I did I expected I wouldn't get a king bed. The clerk who was friendly advised me to check later in the day to see if a king bed room would be available. I had a great view of the Mirage Casino and the volcano so I decided I would just keep the room I had. I went walking down to the Fashion Mall and back to Harrahs. There was hardly anyone out at about 2:00am. However, when I went to the Carnival Court there was a DJ playing and the crowd were in there 20's. I hadn't eaten and was very hungry so I went back into Harrahs and at that time the Oyster Bar was open for food. It did take approximately 40 minutes for me to get a turkey club and fries. However, I watched the cooks/chefs prepare varioius subs and burgers, breakfast items while fresh so I didn't mind the wait and the other patrons didn't seem to mind either. During my stay I didn't spend a lot of time gambling at Harrahs so I didn't have much interaction with the employees. I did appear to me that the employees were assisting others well.

I know many people hate having the long walk from their room to/from the elevator, but it\u2019s never bothered me as I find it to be a bit quieter due to the limited amount of foot traffic passing by my door. My room was located on the seventh floor and I found it to be clean, but rather small. The view was primarily of another rooftop, but had I been a bit higher I may have had more of a promising view. Again, not a big deal for a two night stay. As I mentioned, the room was rather small \u2013 for me it was fine, but for two people it may be an issue. The furniture wasn\u2019t in bad shape and the bed was rather comfy. The bathroom was clean, but someone did a crummy grout job in the tub and it looked worse than it really was.

Entertainment here has nothing exciting except for the 2 twins who does their Piano act. I always noticed a full house here. My personal recommendation is to request for Carnival towers because that was where i first stayed.Maybe it was the 6 nights, maybe it was the tower I am not sure. I stayed there again in Dec 06 and was given the Mardi Gras Tower. This time i was given the corner units. AVOID this at all cost because they are smaller then the other units (as seen on the fire escape plan). However I noticed that the basic rooms are smaller then the one I stayed in (Carnival towers). The furniture in this hotel is old but the location is second to none being in the middle of the strip.

Got an offer in the mail for 2 free nights and a free leather jacket at check in---couldn't pass that one up! Already had 4 nights free at the Nugget starting on Saturday so we booked Harrah's for Sunday and Monday and hopped back and forth. Check in at Harrah's was great, were offered an upgrade to a suite for $50 but passed seeing as we're seldom in our room anyway. Got our jacket just as they promised and it's a pretty nice one. Thought there'd be a catch but there wasn't. Our room was in the Carnival tower and yes it is a long walk to the rooms but all of the staff is so friendly and helpful that we didn't really mind. Anybody who's been to the strip knows it's a long walk to anything, which is why we usually stay downtown at the Nugget (won't anymore--see review at Nugget site). Our room was very quiet, tho other reviews have said the opposite. Room had a special heating/cooling system that you can set when you're in the room. It ahs a sensor that detects when you've left the room and lowers or raises the room temperature automatically according to the season to conserve energy. Pretty slick---no noisy fans blowing. The rooms in our towere all have minibars and ours hummed constantly but I kind of liked the \"white noise\". Our room had 2 queen beds that were very comfy as well as a table and chairs, bath was nice size and all was clean. We ate at the buffet twice, once for supper and once for breakfast---food was excellent both times---huge selection and great staff--both times there was a players club rep at the buffet line offering coupons and gifts for signing up for a player's card. Hubbie already had one so I signed up and got $15.00 in coupons for the buffet that night. I play penny slots and the service in the slot areas is fantastic---spoke with one of the managers and complimented him on the speed and friendliness of slot staff and beverage servers---they not only show up at your machine promptly (2 minutes) but they also introduce themselves and offer to help if you need anything else. Once when I hit the service light (for change) the slot manager came and was on his headset asking if the light on my machine had registered with the staff. They all wear headsets and get a signal when a service light is activated on a machine and they literally come running. The manager told me they don't have fountains, they have people. Their customer service training shows---great staff throughout the facility. The only problem we had with Harrah's was the comp system. Doesn't matter if you play tables or slots---you use the same card and accrue points towards comps. Gone are the days when you could play blackjack for a few hours and ask for a buffet or dinner comp. It all goes on the card and the credits are meager. Hubbie played blackjack off and on for 2 days while I played penny slots. He plays $100 per hand, sometimes more, and at the end of our stay I had more comps than he did---$24 for me and $9.52 for him. We used the credit to pay for the meal we charged to our room. I think we'd stay there again if the rooms were comped but we'd probably gamble where the table players are more appreciated. The casinos all seem to hand out comp rooms like candy, as long as you've used a player's card so there's really nothing special about getting those offers in the mail. How we're treated when we get there is what matters to us. Golden Nugget has gotten very tight with their comps as well. After both of us playing there for 3 days we had NO comp credits built up---not even enough for one meal. Hubbie played blackjack for one hour at the Las Vegas Club and they gave him a $20 meal comp (and they have good cafe food at the Upper Deck, with great staff). The smaller casinos seem more generous with the comps, more interested in keeping you there. The free shuttle to the Rio is nice, of course they're owned by the same company, as well as Caesar's, Bally's, Horseshoe, Flamingo and some others. So if you have a card and play at any of them it all adds up. Use your card! Charge your meals to your room and when you check out ask them to swipe your player's card and whatever credits you've earned can be credited towards your room bill. The credits are only good from the first of the year thru the end of the year so if you only go to Vegas once a year you'll lose them if you don't use them.

We go every year for the long MLK weekend. This year we stayed from Jan 11-15. My husband gambles a lot, so after paying for our first stay, we have stayed free (on comps) for the past two years. Harrah's just has a great atmosphere. You can not beat the location. Room wise, last year we stayed in the Carnival tower and had an awesome view. This year, we were in the Mardi Gras tower on the 8th floor. Like someone else said, the walls are paper thin and you hear everything. There is live music down in the little courtyard area and they are loud til the wee hours of the morning - so if you are in the Mardi Gras tower and you go to bed early, you'll definitely hear the music. Our room was nice...king sized bed that was super comfy, two flat screen TV's, one of which was in the bathroom. The casino at Harrah's gets so packed on the weekends - it's hard to find a blackjack table at night. But again, the atmosphere is so fun, and for the location I just think it attracts a lot of folks.

We used our players card points to get a discount that worked out to an average of $60/night. Had read several reviews about dirty rooms and outside noise issues. We were pleasantly surprised that we had neither problem. Our first room was in the Marti Gras tower. Despite our request for rollaway bed, the room was far too small for that. Plus the A/C unit was running like a diesel on its last leg. We went back to the front desk and were placed in the Carnival tower 16th floor. Room was updated and well appointed. Only issue was a lack of soap, shampoo or lotion in the room, which one call to housekeeping rectified. Two queen beds were comfortable, as was the rollaway (which was a little short for my 6\u20191 brother, but otherwise OK). We had a handicap room (supposedly because of the extra space) which was fine except the shower was very low on water pressure. The casino was clean, if a little smokey. This may have been caused in part by the 10,000 rodeo fans that had swarmed to Vegas this particular week. Dealers were personable and helpful. Pit bosses were particularly good, making a point to dole out charm and helpful advice. The winner for the weekend was Pricilla who dealt Casino Texas Holdem (play against the house, not each other). Finding a cocktail waitress was sometimes a chore and the waits for drinks could be long, so when the first one arrives, order another on the spot just to be safe. Call liquors were no problem, but remember to name your brand or you get the house rotgut. The restaurants were less impressive. We ate at the Range Steakhouse and were unimpressed. The $42 ribeye steak was up to its billing as prime beef well cooked, but the service was only fair. The vegetables were particularly disappointing. We ordered creamed spinach for the table (usually a steak house staple) and received a bowl of gooey cream sauce with a pitiful amount of spinach (my brother returned from the restroom to see it and asked who ordered soup). It was also salted to the point on inedibility. We returned it for the saut\u00e9ed red potatoes and were only marginally happier with the bitter oily flavor they sported. The Oyster bar served better fare. The crab cakes and Louisiana chicken nugget salad were winners. The Italian place next to it was also above average. Excellent bruchetta with pesto, good crusty bread, good service were all there. All three entrees (two beef and one chicken) were well done. The Spa at Harrah\u2019s was a little disappointing. After staying at Rio, Luxor and Monte Carlo on prior visits, this was a small and unimpressive cousin. The masseuse was acceptable if a little older than I would have liked. The upside was the shower. The spa was right by the Carnival elevators on the 4th floor, so I used the shower in the spa instead of suffering in the no pressure room shower. Fairly convenient to reach and excellent water and space. On a side note, if you forget toiletries, DON\u2019T buy the junk in the minibar. The Spa has toothbrushes, razors, shaving cream, and hair gel available. Locker space was tight, so be prepared just to camp out on a bench. Bottled water on the house at The Spa, so a good place to grab a few for the room since the Vegas tap water is awful. For a Spa with no access fee, it was not a bad deal. The location on the strip is perhaps the best feature of Harrah's. Easy access to Mirage, Bally's and Paris. Plus two of the lower level casino's are right next door, so if you want to go upscale to Paris or play $3 craps at the blue collar casino, all three are an easy walk. There is also in house access to the monorail which runs up and down the strip. Other notes from the visit: The buffet at Wynn was a treat. We had Friday lunch there and were extremely impressed. Great quality for around $25/head. Asian restaurant at MGM was also a winner, but pricey.

Arrived Sunday May 1st about 9:30 am and went directly to front desk to register. Very short line only waited about 5 minutes. Lady at check-in desk was extremely friendly. She originally said our room was located in Madri Gra tower. I asked for the Carnvial tower and she said no problem. I did not realize there was a difference in towers until I read reviews. Understand Carnival tower has been recently remodeled. We did get our room immediately , did not have to wait for check-in time which was 4 pm. Room was very large and everything was clean. The only problem was no coffee maker and for me this is a very big problem. Have to have my caffeine as soon as feet hit floor or my day is ruined. Had to walk to Walgreen's down the strip by MGM. Very hot day and was extremely tired. On the way back stopped at Alladin to rest for a while. Of course left there lighter in pocket book. My husband plays Keno and some slots, I only play slots. No luck except little pay offs the entire trip. One day going hit the big one. Had a wonderful trip. There are no frills at Harrahs just the basics which is okay since we only go to room to sleep for a few hours anyway. The only problem was the mattress was very uncomfortable, very hard. Remember to ask for a room not facing the band or you will be listening to loud music all night. This happened one year when we asked for a strip view. Never again, even with pillow over my head could still hear the very, very loud music. Keep us awake most of night. We should have asked to be moved to another room but didn't get around to it. We saw the new Wynn which is very impressive. Also took bus to Orleans. It was okay but wouldn't want to stay there because of location. Ate at buffet there, it was very good. Try to see new casino's ever year. Next year want to try Palace Station and Hard Rock. Have no desire to go to Hooters. By the way we did stay at Harrah's for 5 nights for $250, gamblers rate. Ate at Harrahs buffet a few times and the coffee shop first night. Food was very good at both restaurants. Comps are really down from what we use to receive. Only ate at buffet twice free. We use to eat the entire week free and couple nights the room were comped. Vegas is getting to be very high class. Wonder what is going to happen to middle class casino's. Have heard Imperial Palace and Harrah will be imploded to put up another Mega casino. This seems to be going on all over Vegas.

We got a great price on a package through US Airways and couldn't have asked for much more for the price. We arrived in Vegas after midnight and we had to wait in the check in line at Harrahs for about 30 minutes before getting our room keys. Unfortunately, we couldn't use the hotel check in at the airport because it was too late and they had closed. Had no problems checking in and was given a room in the Carnival Tower like we requested. The room itself was good, considering what we had paid for it. I had stayed at the Flammingo a few months earlier and I would say that room was better than the one at Harrah's. The beds were a little uncomfortable (firm) and the pillows seemed to be pretty old. The bathroom was decent sized and clean, no mildew smell. The ring around the shower head was loose and needed to be reattached to the tile but other than that the shower was fine. Not much water pressure in the sink and the water smelled like sulfer so drinking it was an act of desperation. No safe in the room, which I've seen some people complain about before, but it didn't bother us. Use common sense and if you have anything that needs to be in a safe there are safety deposit boxes in the lobby of the hotel. Coffee make worked great, as did the TV. The best part about starying at Harrah's was the location. Most of my trips to Vegas, I've stayed furhter south on the strip and it was nice to get a change. I've done all the sight seeing in Vegas, so walking up and down the strip doesn't appeal too much anymore. I liked that I had some casino's around me that I hadn't spent a lot of time at in the past. Like, I said the location is definatly the highlight of this resort. We didn't make it to the pool, but we could see it from our room. It got pretty busy during the day and it didn't look too big from where we were at. I've seen better pools in Vegas, but I've also seen worse. We ate breakfast one morning at the Flavors buffett and it was great! I would recommend it to anyone and it wasn't terrribly expensive either. The food was high quality and the selection was huge. The only issue I had was we requested a late check out because our flight didn't leave until midnight and the best they could do was noon. Not a big deal, but it would have been nice to have access to our room for the afternoon so we could have used the pool and had a place to shower and change before we left. I would recommend Harrah's to the budget traveler who isn't looking for high class ammenities. If you want that pay a little extra and you'll find it.

I called orbitz and after few minutes hold time i connected to the customer assistance. She was extremely helpful and called hotel and within few minutes my reservation was put in system. I recommend as does Harrahs if you book thru outside agency call a few days ahead to make sure your reservation has been put in system.

I asked for an upgrade and she stated she had a few Suites available for $75 /nt ,But being on a Saturday, she would have to check with mgr.

If I were traveling with my wife, I would spend the extra $ and stay at the Wynn, Bellagio or the 4 Seasons. The location was good, the service was good (especially being able to check in at the airport) and the dealers were friendly. The food however, was definitely lacking. The buffet had long lines for \"cafeteria\" food. The new Italian restaurant seemed to have recently opened and was decorated nicely. However, the food and the service were compairable to a really bad chain restaurant with inflated pricing (4 beers, 2 apps, 2 entrees = 125.00 + tip). If you want a \"decent\" bottle of wine and don't want to drop a C note bring your own. If $ doesn't matter, they have a few nice reds on the list like current vintage Solaia for 400. The best dinning value I found was the breakfast buffet at the Bellagio for $15 (be there by 10:00 or wait in line). Bottom line!!

A regular Hotel room. Basic furnishings, wet bar, armoire w/ironing board, and Bathroom. I checked and sheets were clean and linens were clean too. TV channels are scarce, but do you really watch alot of TV in Vegas. I only needed room to sleep and shower. Did here a little noise in halls but overall not too bad. My room overloooked the Air conditioning unit as you will see in my photos. On my last night, new people checked in next door and they were very loud thru connecting door. no much noise proofing. The casino is Just like all the ohers. Smokey, loud, but thats is fun. Th drink service was Very good. The cocktailers were around every few minutes so I did not have to wait at all, every day i played. IMHO I thought the buffet was excellent for the money. I started with Sushi and Sweet and sour chicken, Then i had Crab legs w/fried shrimp and scallops. after that course I had Prime rib with Horeradish sauce and corn on the cob, and finally for dessert i had Creme Brulee and bread pudding. Excellent value at 19.99. I also ate at the cafe around 10pm one night and Marble rye patty melt was excellent. Finally slots were very tight. I saw 1 winner, Laady playing .25 slots. she was playing .75 a pull and won $225 1 pull then 5pulls later won $932. I just laughed as I was losing pull after pull. The Dualing Pianos and carnaval Bar are very nice. The Twins were Great and The outside bar was Hopping every night.

Our first night was spent listening to the drone of some very loud music coming from the pool area. This lasted until 3:00 am. Of course the next day we changed to a different room in a different tower that was much quieter. Remember that there are 2 towers, The Mardi Gras, which is older, and The Carnival, which has larger rooms. A big problem at Harrah's is lack of affordable food options having no food courts. To have even a simple breakfast costs you dearly, especially at the coffee shop. Aside for the high prices, the service was horrible. We had to wait in a long line and even after we were seated it took forever to be served our food. This happened more than once so we ended up eating most of our meals outside the hotel. This was not so much a problem for us having rented a car but I could see this being a hassle if one were to stay strictly at the hotel. Now for the positive. Our dinner at \"The Range Steak House\" was superb and the service outstanding. One of the best steakhouses in Vegas...and we've been to a lot.

Hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly. I became ill in the casino and help was there within minutes, providing professional attention, advising me of my options and not leaving my side until they were sure I had recovered. Management followed up the next day by telephone, and the security chief himself located me in the casino later that night and asked me how I was doing. I was very impressed and made to feel more like a person than just a guest/player. Our room on the 16th floor of the Carnaval Tower was immaculate and comfortable, with plenty of room to move around, a decent supply of towels and a partial strip view. (Unless you're traveling over the strip by airplane, standing on top of the statue at the Venetian, or are an extremely high roller, a partial strip view is the best you can hope for; besides, a clean, comfortable and safe place to sleep is far more important than the view.) Amenities included an in-room safe, hair dryer, iron and ironing board, clock radio, desk, table and chairs, mini-refreshment bar and fridge, low-end lotion, soap and shampoo, full-length mirror, television and telephone with voice mail, nice plumpy pillows (extras in the closet) and a comfortable bed. Temperatures were comfortable. The bathroom was roomy. Security is visible in the casino and in the hotel, \"privacy please\" signs are respected, and the room was very quiet. Even when other rooms were being cleaned, I never heard any noise. Corridors are wide and well-lit, and the elevator arrived right away. Harrah's is right smack in the middle of the strip, and the cool March weather made walking long distances a pleasure, although it was a bit windy. A jacket, hoodie or sweater is a must in the early morning and after sundown at this time of year. Buy decent souvenir tee shirts and fleeces at Casino Royale next door ($5 for the tees, $10 for the fleeces). There are plenty of fair-priced restaurants nearby, including a Denny's where you can carbo-load for next to nothing and not feel hungry until dinner time. We ate twice at The Cafe at the hotel (one dinner, one breakfast) and found the food plentiful, good and decently-priced - $11.99 for a respectable prime rib, potato and vegetable, served with warm rolls. Service was a tad slow at dinner, but the waiter apologized for the delay. There was a line at breakfast time, but once seated, service was quick and the food was hot and good. I'm mainly a slot player and found plenty of machines of all denominations and types to play on. Harrah's Carnaval Court is a fun place to visit; although it's mainly a shopping plaza, there is live music and entertaining bartenders at night, and the crowd always seems to be having a good time. Harrah's free shuttle to its sister property, the Rio, comes every twenty minutes or so. Plan on taking it for the free show, which includes clowns and mimes who engage the audience and toss mardi gras beads, a short stage revue, and the magnificent overhead floats. We had dinner at the Twisted Kilt there, more a pub/bar than a restaurant and a bit noisy, but with interesting food and very affordable. At the moment, it seems that Vegas is \"under construction.\" There are hotels, vacation properties and condos going up all over the place. Because of that, you will sometimes find your walking areas are narrow, but foot traffic flows smoothly. Road traffic is a different story; Las Vegas Boulevard ALWAYS seems congested, and you can make better time on foot if you're touring the strip than you can in a car. Make sure to observe walk/don't walk signs, though, because vehicles proceed as soon as their signal turns green. There are a number of pedestrian walkways which will take you over the roadways; in some cases, they are the only way to get across the street, and you can use them to get great views of the strip and orient yourself. In spite of the construction and the traffic, though, Vegas is noticeably clean. Be aware that everything is further away than it looks. Ditch the heels and thongs in favor of comfortable walking shoes. The public bus comes quickly and for $2 and about twenty minutes of your time, you can ride all the way downtown to Fremont Street for a taste of old Vegas refined. Make sure to visit some of the smaller casinos there, as well as the flashier establishments like the Golden Nugget; the little places have a charm all their own. The double-decker buses can get crowded and you may have to stand, but they're clean and pleasant to ride in, and a bus ride is a great way to see the whole strip and the area that lies between it and downtown. The bus makes stops at all the hotels from the Stratosphere to New York New York. Harrah's has a monorail stop, as well, as do several hotels; all are clearly marked. Time share sellers are all over Vegas, but all you need to say is no, thanks (or nothing at all); they don't hound you if you make it clear you're not interested. You'll also encounter a large number of people hawking girls for sale; these folks stand in groups on the sidewalk and snap their literature to get the attention of every guy who passes, even if they have to reach across his spouse or girlfriend to do it. Once again, you need only walk past them. It's true they can be annoying, but it's all a part of the cachet of the town. During the day at MGM Grand, you can catch a glimpse of lions descended from Leo the Lion (of MGM movie logo fame) as they play with their trainers in a specially-designed habitat before being returned to the ranch where they live. At night, be sure to take in the free entertainment. Cross the street to the Mirage to see the volcano, which goes off every hour, or walk down to the Bellagio to see the dancing waters; they \"perform\" every fifteen minutes or so. Stay to watch more than one show, since they are synched to a different song every time. Ooohs and Aaaahs are guaranteed. You can secure half-price tickets for same-day shows at the nearby outlets; you may not get the best seats, or even the best shows, but you'll certainly be entertained. Jimmy Buffet's Margheritaville also has a short live show which you can enjoy while you sip their signature drinks or dive into an astounding-sized plate of Volcano Nachos so immense you won't be able to finish it before your entree arrives.

The Carnival Court is a real fun time. We ordered drinks & appetizers & charged everything to our room. We tried the buffet called Flavors for lunch and would highly recommend it. There is such a wide variety of foods you couldn't go away hungry. The dessert selection is very good too. They even have several flavors of ice cream and you can build your own sundae or have a waffle cone. We also charged this lunch to our room. The reason to charge things to your room can be very benefical because as you use your Total Rewards cards in the slots (or at the table games) you can build up comps. We ended up getting our 3 nights for free and also our meals free. Oh - also charged a breakfast in the newly remodeled cafe one morning. When we checked out, our bill was only $3. It pays to use your card. The only drawback I can say is that several of the slot machines need to be replaced. It bothered me that many had cracked glass and the reels were so faded - I love to see all the vibrant colors, sometimes that's what draws me to a machine. They really needed an overhaul or just get new machines. Several of the stools by the machines were very dirty and had cigarette holes in them - not very appealing to sit down. Check out was very easy - no line at 1pm on Friday afternoon. Overall, Harrahs is a great place to stay, if they could just get some new slot machines! Oh, one more thing - pay the price $9 (but can get $2 off discount) to go up to the observation area of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The view is spectacular at night! Lights as far as you can see.

Check-in seemed to go fine, we parked our car in their garage, hauled all our luggage up to our room and... the key card wouldn't work! Very annoyed we kept trying but had no luck. I walked down the hall towards the elevator and was getting ready to call the front desk when a bell boy came down the hall. I told him we had just checked in and our card wasn't working. He said 'aw man, I hope it's not the battery' checked our paperwork that showed the room we were in, used his card to let us in and told us to just let the front desk know our cards weren't working, they must not of been activated properly. So we proceded to get ourselves all settled in, unpacked some of our toiletries, used the restroom, and hung out for awhile looking at brochures and relaxing. We were in there probably 30 mins and decided it was time to 'hit the strip'. But first we need to stop by the desk and get our cards activated, no big deal right? WRONG!!! We told the man at the desk the situation and that our key wouldn't work and he asked to see my paperwork and ID which I gave to him, and he asked if the room was in my name and I said yes. He then took out this little purple strip of paper that was in the folder with the room key and asked if we knew the womans name that was on it. We said no and we had no idea what that paper was even for and I thought the womans name on it was the lady that checked me in. He explained that no it should of been my name on it and it was very strange but somehow when I checked in I was handed the wrong paper. That was why our key wouldn't work is because we were going to the wrong room. We explained that we went to the room we were told to go to and how were we to know any different! After asking us if we had been in the room long and if we had touched much and we said yes we had laid on the beds and used the restroom, he still made us move to a different room! He said he was sorry but the room we went to was registered to the lady who's name was on the paperwork and we were supposed to be in room xxx so we were going to have to move! Not only that but because it was a 'security issue' security would have to open the room for us and we had to identify our luggage before we could get it.

By now our patience was extremely thin and I found it inexcuseable to have to wait for security, I picked up the house phone in the hall and angrily explained the situation and was put on hold, then security finally decided to saunter on up so I hung up. Security proceeded to watch our every move while we gathered our belongings making us feel practically like criminals. The one guy thought it was very weird we had to move to another room and told us to talk to the manager cause it wasn't right how we were treated. We agreed so we did stop by the managers desk where he apologized and comped our first night's stay. Now all that would of been good and fine if the rest of our stay had gone well, the one night free did go a long way towards making up for all our aggravation although it still stunk to start our night off with such a bad start. However we continued to have a bad experience at this hotel! The first morning there we had just got up and my sister was taking a shower when suddenly this very loud, obnoxious alarm goes off. I called the front desk and told them there was this hideous alarm going off and she asked if we were smoking and I said no and she said she'd look into it. Then we opened the door and there was a maid in the room across from us and she said everything is fine it's nothing to worry about. Ok well that's good to know, however it still took them a good 10 minutes to turn the blasted thing off, it was horrible! Later that day we came back to our room in the afternoon to relax for a little while and I went to get some ice to drink ice water and their ice machine was broken! It may seem like a minor thing but it was just one more irritation. Then to top it all off you would expect after such a bad stay to at least get good cutoomer service while checking out, but oh no not at Harrah's! I was all prepared to compain about everything that went wrong but when the woman checking us out asked how our stay was and I replied 'not very good' she just said 'oh, not very good huh'. I couldn't believe it! A normal response would of been oh I'm so sorry what was the problem? not 'oh not very good'! Then when I got my receipt I couldn't tell what had been charged to my card so I said 'can I get a total on here' and she snapped at me 'it's right there plain as day!' Well no, it was not! It had a charge with a minus sign, a room charge, the buffet we ate at Rio and then another charge with a minus sign. At the bottom where it said total it said zero. There was no total on the bill! I wanted to make darn sure the bill was correct and our one night had been comped so I went over to the manager again but he was busy with another customer. So finally another guy asked if he could help us and he explained our bill but when I said the lady checking us out had been rude he didn't respond so we just got the heck out of there! I honestly have never had such a bad experience at a hotel in my life and even if I was offered a free stay there I would hesitate to return!", "Date": "February 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "OKC", "Title": "\u201cGood!\u201d", "Author": "Oklatraveler", "ReviewID": "UR4498653", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at Harrahs from Feb 12-14th, 2 nights. We used a promo code that offered 2 nights free. When making the reservation we looked into the rate for the 1st night, Feb 11th a Saturday, however it was $139 which was more than we were wanting to spend, so we booked at the MGM for a promo rate of $59 for just one night. When we checked in I asked for the Mardi Gras tower as I had heard that it was a little nicer than the Carnival tower. The lady said no that the Carnival tower was better, so we went with the Carnival tower. We actually liked Harrahs better than MGM. We liked the smaller hotel/casino. The rooms at Harrahs were just as nice as MGM, but maybe a little smaller but not a problem for us. When we checked in we ask for a room with a view, however they didn't really have one. Perhaps it was because we were getting the room for free, not sure. But it was OK. Unfortunately, I got sick the first night at Harrahs. The next day, Monday, I spent all day in bed with the flu and bronchitis. Lets just say this is the most I have stayed in bed in Vegas! But the bed was comfortable and the shower felt great. We had made reservations at Battista's for Monday night to celebrate Valentines Day, however, we had to cancel since I was sick. This was very disappointing as I was looking forward to it. Sunday night, before I got sick, we ate at Toby Keith's Bar & Grill. I had Nacho's and my husband had chicken fried steak. His was good but I didn't care for my nacho's. Meat tasted like it had taco seasoning sprinkled on it. But we did enjoy the live house band. The dancing is what brought on the bronchitis. :( The only problem that I can say that was only a minor problem was that the lighting in the bathroom was a low yellowish light. Not bright enough. Other than that, I have no complaints. We ordered room service one night, I was not hungry but my husband ordered a hamburger. He said it was very good. I just had a bowl of fresh fruit. I think the cost of the hamburger was $7.99 including fries. There is a refreshment center cabinet in the room and the stuff inside is expensive. M & M's, peanuts, crackers, coke's, etc. My husband took one item out, a bag of peanuts in the shell, just to look at them and then put them back. When we got ready to check out, we noticed there was a $7 charge on the bill. We called to the front desk and told them we took the item out but then put it back in. So they took it off the bill without a problem. So it is touch sensitive. Not everything in it is $7 though. Some less, not sure how much though because the brochure that is suppose to be posted was not, I had just ask about the prices at the front desk. The parking garage was easy to get to and of course it was free. Check-in and out was easy and no lines to speak of. Friendly service too! The slots weren't paying out too well, but then who's are? We didn't enjoy our stay at Harrahs only because I was sick. But we will go back and stay at Harrahs again. Even if it's not free. But I wouldn't pay more than like $79-89 a night. Location is great!

I also wish to say that there is a very nice reservation clerk Paul, who the previous year gave us outstanding service. I should have sent a letter to his supervisor and made mention of how very nicely we were treated by Paul. Here we were, two senior citizens at 1 o'clock in the am walking into Harrah's on a Sunday nite looking for a room just for one nite, as we had reservations at the Rio for the four following nites. He was friendly, funny and said he would check and see what he could do. (Now again I wish to mention we are not high rollers, we are the couple you see at the quarter machines, having a ball.) He came back and said \"I have a surprise for you. We have a lovely suite available and you can have it for $ 79.00.\" Well we were give a beautiful two room suite with a jacuzzi and giant bathroom with a shower that you could put several people in. A gold phone was on the wall next to the toilet. This was some thing that I'm sure was for a high roller. But you can see how Harrah's goes above and beyond to make the tourist happy, be it the working class Joe, like Chuck and myself, or the high rollers. Harrah's and the Rio will always have us as repeat customers. As I write this, Chuck and I are planning our next trip and you can guess which casino will be seeing us.

The location on the strip cannot be beat and the staff were very friendly and helpful despite the busy time of the holidays. We checked in and got two non-smoking rooms in the newly remodeled Carnival Tower. I was a bit lost at first, and a staff member personally escorted me to the correct elevators. The rooms did not adjoin, but as someone said earlier, the walls are paper thin so you can really hear what\u2019s going on next door. Since we were family it was ok, but I can imagine the inconvenience if you have rowdy neighbors. Also, the TV was a Zenith from the Ice Age. It barely worked and made a buzzing noise the whole time. I didn't bother calling the front desk, but it made me wonder about their recent \"renovation\". The room didn\u2019t have the bells and whistles of other hotels on the strip, but the central location makes it worth staying there. I highly recommend The Caf\u00e9 at Harrah\u2019s. It has reasonably priced, tasty comfort food 24 hrs. a day like pizza, burgers, soups & salads. The newly renovated buffet called Flavors had its grand opening when we were there, but the prices were quite high. Breakfast starts at $12.99 and dinner is a whopping $18.99. There were no coupons or discounts floating around. In fact, upon check in, the only buffet coupons we got were for Rio and the Flamingo. Another plus about Harrah\u2019s is that the Monorail stops there. For about $20, an all day pass gives you unlimited trips up and down the strip. Also, the Carnival Court outside has a small marketplace and is home to the Ghiradelli Ice Cream Parlour which is our favorite. We also had comped tickets to Clint Holmes. The theater was seedier than I expected, and initially we weren\u2019t seated together since the show was \u201csold out\u201d. Luckily, there were lots of open seats and we managed to get a table together. The casino was very tight and I didn\u2019t win much on the slots 25c and $1 slots, but I saw at least two people hit on the Blazing 777 slots and win $1500. The casino is always packed and touted as \u201cBest Slots in Vegas\u201d although my experience was very different. At the Venetian next door I won $450 on the Blazing 777\u2019s and also won $100 at Wynn. So all in all, Harrah\u2019s was a nice place to stay, but not gamble. One final annoyance is the Fairfield Resort desk and showroom on the 2nd floor. You pass by it to go to the garage and Monorail. Pesky salespeople flaunt show-tickets and other free stuff to entice you to take tour of the Grand Desert Timeshare. It\u2019s not worth the 2 hours of torture to get a free dinner, because the sales people are so pushy and grill you for information.

Not only was the room without a micro/fridge, there was neither in-room coffee nor daily newspaper. Second, Harrah's food services were disappointing. The continental breakfast in the business center was attractive, but limited. Two meals (one breakfast, one lunch) were offered at The Range, both of which were far below expectations. The menu, presentation, and service were on par with typical cafeteria fare. The Chinese restaurant offered tasty dishes, however service was inexplicably slow, and the food chilled quickly after it was served. Third, the common areas of Harrah's were less than accommodating. There was no place to sit unless one was gambling, eating or drinking. There was no complementary coffee or paper, even at the front desk. Most disappointing was the lack of pool/spa facilities.

The hotel is located accross from the Forum Shops of Caesar's Palace. You have a great selection of restaurants. You have casinos like the Casino Royale or Imperial Palace for cheap tables on either side of you. The tables at Harrah's were always empty because they are over priced.

Harrahs also has the best comps for players cards. For the last three years everytime I come to vegas I stay at Harrahs, and I have never been disapointed. I have always had a great time.

First off, we booked through Harrah's travel company, they not only comped our flight but our four night stay. On our last day we asked for a late check out and they ended up comping us a whole other night so we could have our room until our flight left at midnight.

We immediately called the host and were reassigned to a \"diamond\" wing of the hotel in the Carnaval tower which was much much better. Maid service was good, so was room service, and security was actually friendly. We saw a little craziness at the hotel (it is Vegas after all) but it was handled quickly. The hotel had a nice balance of people not too young, not too old. There was always something fun going on and if you ever need to be entertained just step outside to Carnaval Court. As far as the casino, well we did really well. REALLY WELL. Believe it or not we won several thousand on the penny slots. It bacame the trip motto to \"go down stairs and win a grand\".

The rooms are not exceptionally large, and may seem smaller to claustrophobic people because of the massive wardrobe hiding a huge TV.

For an overall rating, I give the property an 'adequate' rating.....nothing horrible, but nothing outstanding either. Cons: 1. This Harrah's is one of the older strip hotels, and it has that appearance in the casino/lobby/etc. 2. As mentioned in many reviews, here and elsewhere....the rooms tend to be somewhat noisy. My room was in the Carnival Towers, and I was originally assigned a room on the 10th floor, facing the pool/bar area (but well above it). The music from the bar was enough of a nusiance that I requested to be moved the next day (and was) I then went to the 28th floor, oppisite wing, facing the airport side. This room was much quieter for the most part. However, as the crowd increased towards the weekend.....it got worse. If there is ANY noise in the halls, it goes directly into the rooms. Even casual conversation is heard loud and clear in the rooms. In my case, there was a 'party' taking place in the hall which obviously was unbearable. After calling the front desk, 'security' came after about 20 mins and quieted things down. However, you could still 'hear' when other guests return to their rooms, turn on the TV's, etc. I guess this is a result of the age of property, but the lack of soundproofing is definitely an issue if you're a light sleeper, as I am. I would return for a mid-week stay, but the 'noise factor' would deter me from staying at Harrah's for a weekend. 3. Slots seemed to be 'tight' and there was a obvious lack of many of the newer games. Table games were always available, but limits go up at night of course. 4. The matteress in the first room was awful....the springs felt like they were going to come through the padding at any time. However, in the second room, the bed was quite comfortable. Pros: 1. Location. Obviously convenient to many of the other strip attractions. Walking distance to Venetian, Wynn, Ceasars, etc....even in 110 degree heat. The monorail station is right at the back of the hotel....an easy walk from the rooms. 2. Rooms were clean, and requests for extra towels/pillows were filled promptly. Housekeeping was always available, but not a 'nusiance'. 3. I ate at the 'Cafe' and the buffets. Both were good. 4. Rooms are convenient to the casino/rest......even if you're at the end of the hall, it's only a couple of minutes from the room to the casino. Not the case in some Vegas locations Bottom Line: If you know what to 'expect', Harrah's can be a 'good deal'.

The property is in need of an update to compete with the other strip hotels. It has the feel of a downtown Vegas hotel rather than the mega resorts now dominating the strip. The casino was very claustrophobic. A lot of machines and tables crammed into a small space. The walkways were confusing, some seemed to lead to nowhere. The ceiling throughout much of the casino seems very low. It is pretty dark in many areas. I was not comfortable there. The gambling was also horrible for me... The room I was in--in the older tower was okay. It was small but clean and pretty well appointed. I don't like shower curtains but other than that the bathroom was fine. The hotel staff was polite, efficient and helpful for the most part and the hotel's location is good. If you must stay on the strip, but you refuse to pay megaresort prices, this is an okay choice.

We arrived at the airport and our friends had arranged several days before for a limo to pick us up, but none ever showed. Check in was slow (and this was at the Diamond counter) and we got a really irritating lady with a high voice who needed some Prozac badly. The $20 trick got us nowhere and so we went to our room. Basic as basic can get. Clean and a nice size bathroom, with a view of the parking garage down below. No safe. We called to see if we could get a room with a safe but all of them were booked. Our friends had a junior suite, which they said was nothing impressive, and no safe in there either. No coffee maker. Which really ticked me off because every morning I swear they pumped coffee smell down the hallway, there was a Starbucks on the first floor and it must have come up with the elevators. The casino itself is fine, compared to some others we saw at the north end of the strip, and even next store to us.

That covered our breakfast and lunch buffets and that's about it. If you like to play slots, the best times I found were before 11 a.m., I won a few hundred here and there, always in the morning. Then would pump it back into the slots and lose it later in the evening. The buffets were fine, I had read some bad reviews on them but did not have any problems, we ate at the dinner buffet one night and I thought it was very good. Did not go to any other buffets though so have nothing to compare to. The breakfast buffet Sunday morning seemed a little stale, but that was the second time we had eaten there.

We had two rooms in the Mardi Gras tower, one smoking on the 11th floor for the parents, and the 10th floor room 1048 (end unit) nonsmoking room for my fiance and I. From our room we could barely see over the Casino Royale facade for a view of Mirage's volcano, but I wasn't there to see volcanos, or for a wonderful stay in a room. For $35 a night on the strip, the hotel could not be beat. The beds aren't great, but they're not travelodge foam pads either. I personally didn't have a problem with them, and neither did my fiance who does extensive travel for work (usually staying at the Westin). The room reminded me of a trailer, the central air was loud when running and was activated by motion sensors that didn't sense anything when you were sleeping so I imagine it could get uncomfortable in the summer. We experienced a maid coming in on us in the morning, but that's what we get for not putting the privacy sign out. They did a good job, even folded the toilet paper into a triangle. The hotel had the Gilchrist Soames variety of toiletries with the godawful shampoo/conditioner combo goop, I recommend bringing your own travel variety. My hair was matted for five days. The shower curtain was another godawful component of the bathroom, there was so much???? caked on it that the curtain was stuck together at the bottom and would not allow for adequate protection around the tub. I could not bring myself to bend over to inspect or correct, I have poor eyes and enjoyed my ignorance. As for the common complaint of noise... This is my opinion, may not be a fair representation... We had an end unit (room number 1048 for your convenience) and was quiet, until Monday (20th). Then we had neighbors who liked to play Keno from their room on the TV. How did we know? Because we could hear them repeat the numbers on the TV and exclaim voluminous epithets to describe their losses. Again, for $35 a night, I could tolerate it and it reminded me that I wasn't here to sleep so I went down to play. My opinion is the larger hotels book every other room in a hallway to avoid this noise problem, there are tradeoffs though, it was a very short walk to anywhere within and out of the casino. I traveled with someone I met there to his room in the nearby Venetian and went through two separate elevators and wings to get to his room, in addition to two guards. It was a hike, and they pump some kind of funny smell in that place, my fiance liked it, I didn't care for it. I have stayed at the MGM and had a similar hike but no smell, still didn't care for it. Anyways, I was not intending to enjoy the room... While in Vegas I played craps at the Venetian, Casino Royale, Flamingo, and of course Harrah's. I found myself returning to Harrah's every time because of the people playing there and the quality service from the hotel staff. Drinks were fast (everywhere else was slow or fair), I drank Cointreau on the rocks so that they couldn't fool with it. After a couple of tips in Harrah's the drinks went from a shot of rocks and a dab of honey to a full glass of the good stuff. I was impressed. You can find $10 mins here from the hours of 10pm-2am, $5 and up otherwise. I played until 6am for three nights and managed to catch a cold in the process, so in those three nights I managed to get something like 477 credits for my play on mostly $5 min craps. 18+ hours of play for 477 credits, what did I do wrong? I think that could get me a breakfast comped. Some posts have complimented their comps but I can't agree. In addition, I think the points expire in 6 months so there isn't much use unless you are close to a Harrah's establishment. Someone else can confirm that. The food was fine, service within the restaurants was fine, nothing exceptional but these restaurants are designed to feed you and move you, I personally like the efficiency because there wasn't ever a wait (given 12/18-12/23). Time is money, no? We went to Cirque's \"Ka\" for $100 a head, it was good. I'm not a big fan of theatre altogether (we went to Chicago and saw Blue Man Group which was another godawful event) but I felt my money was well spent. They did a very good performance. My fiance is a Cirque fan and she said she loved it. It took 20 minutes for the valet to get our car at the MGM, another reason I would not return to the \"city\". The four of us decided to make one more night out of something so my dear mother, bless her heart, decided to go to a dinner theatre west of the 15 at a restaurant called the \"Egg and I\" for $50 a head. We thought that would include wine but we were mistaken to the tune of another $60. The food was prepared like one of those all inclusive resorts, you know what I mean, it was hard to swallow, and I had the cold then too. It was terrible, everything. I do not recommend it, especially for $260. For $35 a night this place can't be beat, I think when it reaches up into about the $80 mark I would begin to seriously consider weighing other choices. Big plusses for this place is the size (no hiking), the staff, the efficiency (no waiting anywhere from the elevators to the check in desk), and just plain fun. My fiance will not return because she does not gamble, so if fun=gambling, this is your place. I would go back. My budget for travel would scream at me for blowing $150+ a night when I could stay across the street for $35 and have a bigger bank roll for play. Casino Royale next door claims it gives you $50 in free slot play, I thought 'hey what the heck', it was $50 on a $1 slot machine sectioned off as 'promotional' and the only way to win was to hit jackpot. Time is money, I wasn't wasting my time... If you have read all of this thank you, and thank you all who have posted before, it was a major help in deciding where to visit in Vegas. If you have read this and you are the groom getting married in Vegas, make sure you get a limo, it is very tasteless for you to be dragging your wife across the street everywhere to get silly pictures of \"landmarks\" that will eventually implode in another decade or two.

Check in was fast, hotel clerk very informative. Rooms not as large as the Bellagio, but for one fifth the price, they were more than adequate. The only gripe I have is there's no safe in the room. One thing I DID like is that you can get from the parking garage to the hotel lobby and your room without trudging all through the casino like at some other hotels. Every employee I met at Harrah's was friendly and helpful. The cocktail waitresses came around often in the casino, I never waited for a free drink at the bar, and the floor people were great. The only meal we had at Harrah's was the breakfast buffet, which was decent but nothing to write home about (LOVE the Paris breakfast buffet...so we took the short walk over there!). Great thing about Harrah's is the central location so you can get just about anywhere else on the strip you want to be.

This was my first stay. The location was great (in the center of everything), the price was awesome ($29), the room was large (a truly non-smoking room smell), and the service was GREAT. After returning home, I realized that I accidently left a pair of pajamas under the bed sheets. I called their lost and found (almost midnight) and they immediately identified my pajamas and promised to mail it back. Just got my pajamas safe and sound by Priority Mail delivery. Not sure if this is general policy in all Vegas hotels, but I was truly impressed and thankful. The only complaint I had about my room is that the shower was weak.", "Date": "January 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington,D.C", "Title": "\u201cH-O-R-R-I-B-L-E experience, POOR customer service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1618279", "Content": "Found a great deal and reserved 3 rooms (3 separate reservations) for christmas night through travelocity.

They managed to check us in at 10am and we got the room we asked for. It was very clean and spacious. We didn't gamble at the hotel much since the layout and loudness of it (not to mention not being offered any drinks at any point) sent us in search of other casinos. We ate at the buffet on two occasions and it seemed ok, a tad pricey for what you got, though. Overall, the experience was good, you couldn't beat the location. My sister had moved something in the minibar at one point and we were charged $4.25 even though we didn't consume anything. The woman at the checkout explained they have sensors in the fridges that will charge anything removed to the room even if it is put back. She took the charge off our bill which I thought was very nice of her since we made the mistake. However, I just checked my credit card bill and they just added the $4.25 back onto it as a separate charge. All in all, Harrah's had everything we needed, nothin fancy, just the basics.", "Date": "January 10, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cHarrah's Is Our Favorite\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1544049", "Content": "I go to Las Vegas 2 or 3 times a year for fun.

Our experience was excellent. Check in was easy and quick. Room was adequate with a view of the parking lot but we were not in the room that much anyway. The slots were very generous to me. The first machine I sat down at paid $300. Won many more comparable pots in the Harrah's casino. Gambled at a few other places and won small pots but nothing compared to Harrah's. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. When we left we had run up a $160 room bill (room service and mini-bar) and they comped all of it. Complimentary tickets to Mac King comedy show were given upon check-in but we did not use the tickets. We instead chose to go to the Improv and the show was excellent and we asked for the tickets to be comped and they were happy to do it. Checkout was very fast. We never ate at any of the restaurants in Harrah's so can't comment on that. The line at the Garden Buffet was very long most of the time. A good place to eat if you visit the Hard Rock is Mr. Lucky's. They have a Steak and Shrimp that is worth the $7.77 you pay for it. Another excellent place to eat is Bellasarios at Caesar's. The food was excellent and medium priced. Overall our trip was great and we would gladly stay at Harrah's again for the location alone.", "Date": "January 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, OH", "Title": "\u201cGood location - nothing fancy\u201d", "Author": "travel23", "ReviewID": "UR1543176", "Content": "EXCELLENT LOCATION and then it's an average hotel. Room was clean, view was bad (rooftop A/C and misc pipes) but at $59/nite I wasn't going to complain. They have quite a few things to do there, they have a outside stage / bar area that has live music and vendors (food and merchandise). We saw a great disco cover band there and they played for 2 hours with only 2 quick breaks. The bartenders put on a nice show while making the drinks. The casino got a little smokey at night time and the dealers were not very energetic when I was there.
