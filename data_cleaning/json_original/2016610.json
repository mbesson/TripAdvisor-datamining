Checking in took about five minutes for my five-night stay. Views from the guestrooms are spectacular whichever direction one looks; on a clear day, one can literally see forever. At night, the Hong Kong and Kowloon skylines are impressively beautiful. However, the expansive glass walls designed to capture natural light and facilitate breath-taking views may preclude acrophobics from staying. My guest room is very comfortably appointed with a king-sized bed flanked by twin night tables, a good-sized writing desk with an executive chair on one side and a guest chair on the other, LG 42\" flat panel TV and DVD player, Nespresso machine, minibar fridge, wingchair and ottoman, low credenza with large drawers and full-sized wardrobes with integrated smaller-than-ideal electronic safe. Comfortable bedroom slippers are free, as are the Nespresso capsules, various tea bags, abundant bottled water and fresh fruit (which were never replenished after the first day). Free internet access is available both via WiFi and a cable with RJ45 male jack. The well-designed bathroom features Kohler sanitaryware and Asprey bath products. There is a full-sized bathtub with a small TV recesssed into the wall, adjoining glass cubicles for shower and toilet (the latter with frosted glass), twin undercounter washbasins with drawers beneath (one of which contains the hairdryer and a vanity box with dentalkit, sewing kit, comb, nail file, etc). The generous use of mirrors makes the well-lit bathroom appear larger. Electrically operated day and night curtains work very well, as do the thoughtfully-positioned lights and switches located discreetly in panels that swivel out from the sides of both night tables.. So what's not to like? WiFi speeds are slow-to-barely-tolerable and the mobile signal for SingTel's Bridge Dataroam Unlimited partner, CSL, varies from atrocious to non-existent. The Michelin-starred Tin Lung Heen served surprisingly bland dishes - but the service staff are good. However, service staff at the buffet breakfast are friendly but not very competent (for example, after waiting 45 minutes for his scrambled eggs, my colleague was finally offered two eggs sunny side up) and Ozone is understaffed, especially when it gets busy past 2200hrs. The hotel's location is great if one wants only to spend time in the Elements mall or International Commerce Centre but is out of the way for activities that require a trek to Tsim Sha Tsui or Hong Kong island.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bali", "Title": "\u201cExceeded expectations\u201d", "Author": "svaroq", "ReviewID": "UR139036734", "Content": "Was there for a few days break.

Swimming pool and jacuzzis on top floor amazing. I was so nicely surprised about the outdoor jacuzzi. Imagine an outdoor jacuzzi on the 118th floor of a building! Service was great. Not pretentious but very down to earth classy. Always here to notice and help without being overwhelming. Breakfast by the windows was just unreal.

Arrival was great with the commissionaire helping with our bags and advising to go up to level 103 to check in. The check in clerk was friendly and took us to our room to check in. Very nice. She noticed it was my mother's birthday when she checked her passport. 5 minutes after she left room service arrived with a cake from the hotel for her birthday!! The room is spacious enough with a nice bathroom. The bathroom amenities are nothing overly special though. The room comes with an iPod preloaded with songs which is a lovely touch. Ofcourse the views are superb, but don't expect too much - Hong Kong is renowned for its thick, blanketting smog. The hotel is above elements shopping centre which offers a lot of labels, a lot of restaurants, a supermarket and mannings and connects to the Kowloon MTR, convenient for the airport express. However it is quite difficult to get to Tsim Sha Tsui, needing a taxi or MTR to Hong Kong, walk to Central station and MTR back to TST. We had a club room, with access to the lounge. The food offerings are extensive but quite average given the brand. Breakfast was small, and although the pastries were all hand made they were burned. The service was good though and always with a smile. The Ozone bar is very impressive with indoor and outdoor areas and a huge selection of cocktails and gin, spent 2 of my 3 nights there. Nice music and again, impressive service. Steve was exceptional, finding us a table and remembering my drinks order on the second night.

I've had the pleasure of staying there twice in the span of 6 months and in 2 different types of rooms. The location is very convenient, right above the Kowloon MTR station and the very high end ELEMENTS mall, although it does take a few escalators to get to the mall itself. Thanks to its location at Kowloon MTR, i was able to take the Airport Express straight from the airport to the hotel, pretty much. As the Ritz is from the 102nd floor of the ICC, it above all other hotels in the city. The views are spectacular and going up to your room feels like you're entering the clouds, which was very much the case on some days when the cloud cover was lower. Every room is well laid out and their famous attention to detail and service is evident here. High speed internet is easily accessible and each room has a blu-ray disc player, something I've yet to see in the other luxury properties I've stayed in, while the television had a wide range of news and entertainment options. The room is big by Hong Kong standards and it feels very well spaced out. The bed is extremely comfortable and the room controls at the side table, made it so much easier for a person to laze in bed. The bathroom is very spacious and the quality of the toiletries are excellent. The soaps/shampoos from Asprey, very plesant and soothing, the towels, so plush and comfortable. I actually tried to purchase them but were told that they weren't for sale, bummer. I absolutely enjoyed using their swimming pool, located on the 118th floor. The view is magnificent and the LED screens on the ceiling and walls, made it even more unique. The changing room provided a full range of amenities as well as a machine that helped spin your swimwear to a fairly dry state, again something I've never seen in other luxury hotels. The staff placed bottled water next to your towels at the pool and endeavour to remember your name. The pool temperature was just perfect and the music was very relaxing. In terms of F&B, I didn't really dine at their restaurants during both visits, though I did enjoy their breakfast buffet. The selection was outstanding and the harbour views even greater. I did try the tea at the Chocolate Library but it was a little too rich for my liking. The pastry shop at the entrance lobby had a nice selection of cakes and I had some delivered to my room, they were really good overall. The staff spoke good english and were able to assist me in my search for a small local bakery as well as recommendations for local pastries. They printed out maps and wrote out the locations in english as well as chinese for my to provide the taxi driver. Overall, I absolutely enjoyed my stay at the Ritz Carlton HK and I'm sure to look forward to the next time I might get to stay at this excellent hotel.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cExpensive, but very pleasant\u201d", "Author": "SHLaw", "ReviewID": "UR137139585", "Content": "Stayed together with family which includes a 10 month old baby.

From the bellboys at the lobby till the reception desk staff, everybody was very friendly and helpful. I had no problems with check-in and my room was already available since I checked-in early. My Deluxe harbour room was very well equipped (42 inch flat screen, blu-ray DVD player, 160GB Ipod and Ipod docking station) with of course and impressive view on the Hong Kong harbour skyline. The bathroom had a separate bath and rain shower with enough amenities and towels for multiple persons. The room was also equipped with a Nespresso coffee maker with 3x2 coffee varieties to choose from. Furthermore the internet was working well, both wired and wireless access was available. In the late afternoon I first decided to take a swim and their swimming pool was very impressive, I never had been so impressed with a pool before. There was also a hot-tub and Jacuzzi to relax in. After my swim I went for dinner. I went for dinner at the lounge and bar restaurant and found my only bad experience of my stay. The staff of this outlet was in my experience very cold and un-personal. They seemed much too busy with themselves, rather than talking or paying attention to guests. When seated I asked if there was a seat available by the window, but unfortunately at that time there wasn\u2019t any. A few minutes later, just besides me a window seat got available and asked the waiter if I could move. He did not seemed to be very happy with my question and seemed to be annoyed by my question. Since I did not care his personal attitude I moved to the seat anyway but again got a very cold and annoyed reaction. Once seated I ordered a burger and a small bottle of water, but got a large bottle of Evian instead. It was maybe a \u201cpay-back\u201d from this waiter to me, for asking too many questions. I found this very weird being a guest at a five star hotel. In total I had to pay HKD 325;- for this experience which was way too much. After dinner I went out for a drink, since I had a bad experience at this F&B outlet. Overall a great experience from all the services of the hotel except the F&B part.

The decor in this hotel is incredible as is the service. I booked a package that included breakfast which was an excellent decision, the breakfast every morning was fantastic, and eating at the window in the mornings overlooking Victoria Harbor is truly an amazing experience. Perhaps the two best parts of the hotel are the bar on the roof (Ozone), which is the highest in the world, and the pool on the level below. Going for a morning swim overlooking Victoria Harbor was absolutely unreal. My only complaint however is that the pool was far too cold to really enjoy, so my friend and I ended up spending most of the time in the hot tub outside, which was also too cold actually. The pool should be kept much more warm so that its comfortable to relax in and enjoy the view. Other than that, you will remember your trip for the rest of your life if you stay at this hotel.

The food and service were absolutely sublime. The Club manager was the epitome of the kind of service expected in a first class hotel. The staff catered to our every need. As for the public areas, the hotel is all glitz. For some, this may be off-putting. I liked the glitz as a nice change from the usual feel of a more traditional Ritz-Carlton. All areas were immaculately clean and brimming in excess. Again, the finishes were opulent and well done. After a very late night arrival into Hong Kong and being quite jet lagged, we partied the night and morning away in the oh-so-swanky Ozone nightclub at the top of the building. It was quite exhilarating to have a cocktail outside at 116 floors. The spa, fitness area and pool were mesmerizing in their level of detail. It was obvious that the designer intended to wow the guests. Again, this hotel is EXPENSIVE and I would have loved to be able to stay there and spend less.

That is certainly a major marketing factor. But as hotel chains are constantly battling for that title, particularly in Asia, that will likely be a short lived distinction. Once that title is taken away, what then? The best thing I can say about this new hotel is that from its lofty perch atop the International Commerce Centre in Kowloon, the views are stellar--providing they aren't obscured by cloudy skies or smog. The service I received, while top notch, wasn't particularly outstanding as one would expect from this hotel chain--or any five star property for that matter. The hotel clearly is relying on its WOW! factor, with lots of splash and glam, but is sorely misses the mark of its predecessor, the former Ritz Carlton in Central, in that it lacks the sudued elegance and refined sophistication and personal luxury that I had come to rely upon. Also, for me personally, a major distractor was the inconvenient layout which required taking an elevator up to the lobby, then taking a different elevator in order to access your room. The same inconvenient choreography.was required to reach the hotel restaurants (substandard for five star hotel),bars and swimming pool or fitness facilities. Give it a miss for your choice of hotel in Hong Kong, as better choices abound, both in Kowloon and Central.

Full stop. I've been fortunate enough to travel the globe and stay in some top hotels. This hotel really is the best I've stayed in to date! You might ask why, so let me explain and offer a few tips to make your stay that little bit more enjoyable. Firstly, at the time of writing and the time I visited, this was the highest hotel in the world. It's also got the highest bar in the world. That makes it a special place. Spend some time up there when it's not cloudy (it does get cloudy quite a bit) and you get some of the most fantastic views of Hong Kong. The hotel is beautifully designed and finished. I'm no writer, but it's an elegant blend of tradition with all the modern comforts you could need. The smallest room is 50+ square metres. Big by any standard. The rooms are beautiful. Lots of room, comfy beds and fantastic bathrooms. I have stayed here multiple times and the staff are superb; very polite and friendly. Breakfast in the Lounge and Bar is a buffet. Fantastic food. Not the largest selection you'll find, but excellent food in opulent but comfortable surroundings, with those amazing views. I haven't had a chance yet to try any of the other restaurants in the hotel. I'm sure they'll be up to the same standard. Now for a few practical notes: The Airport Express train does indeed terminate in the bottom of the building (Kowloon station), but with luggage it's a fair trek through the shopping mall to the hotel reception. Get a cab from the airport. Better still, ask the hotel to pick you up from the airport (and if you want something special, ask for a Rolls Royce Phantom). The Ozone bar at the top of the hotel gets busy with non hotel guests. They can cause queues at the lifts, although I've not yet experienced any major disruption from them. Location - the hotel is not in the middle of the action, so taxis don't seem to frequent the reception as much as other hotels (just allow plenty of time if it's raining/busy), but stand outside at the taxi pick up point, look at the view of Hong Kong and you'll remember why you chose to stay there! The MTR in the base of the building connects you directly to Hong Kong island. I probably haven't convinced you that this is the best hotel in the world. Let me finish by saying that I travel to Hong Kong regularly and think that it's full of world class hotels. There were great. This is better.

The idea of staying in the world's highest hotel was quite appealing. To make it extra special we thought we'd upgrade to a club rate to enjoy the facilities available on the club floor. On arrival at the street level lobby you're met with a seating area, a counter selling sweets of some kind and some staff members who do a combination of welcoming and herding you. It all feels a little stark and I, for one, felt a little uneasy. There isn't an intuitive flow to the whole experience. To make matters worse one must now travel up to the 103rd floor where, if you're a club guest, you have to pass what is clearly a check in reception area and find another set of lifts which takes you to the 116th floor. Here, on exiting the lift, you're met with a desk staffed by two people. No, it's still not the check in area. It's the spa. For check in you need to pass the lifts again and go around the corner and through a set of double doors into a little lobby with two desks. Soon enough someone emerges to check you in. While waiting for my room I thought I'd sit at the pool. It's on the 118th floor. With the use of someone else's key card I could operate the lift's buttons and up I went. One exits the lift to find another lobby (deserted) with a desk. Above the desk is a sign saying \"Fitness centre\" and \"Swimming pool\". Following the arrows leads you down a stark corridor which ends at a locked door. Through it you can see exercise bikes. Not a soul. I turned back to see if I'd reads the sign correctly. I had but thought I'd continue past the desk and search the other side of the corridor. At the end one encounters the men's lockers. Deserted. Back I went in the original direction as I was sure I saw another door along the way. Yep. Found the door. Opened it to see if that's where the pool was. No. This was the service entrance to the bar area which was closed until 5pm. More desolation. I just gave up at this point and went back downstairs to 116. On arrival back in the check in area I was met with strange looks from those who'd directed me to the pool. I wasn't going to explain. I asked if I could sit and wait there. I could. After about 30mins I was offered a coffee. I accepted. After that I just had to get out of there because I had the overwhelming feeling that I was imposing on these people. So I navigated my way through the maze of lifts and lobbies and left the hotel completely. I returned an hour later as I was now expecting to get a room. Nope. It took another hour and a half. I spent the time sitting in the check in area again, reading. After a while I asked if I could help myself to another coffee. Yes, I could. The I sat feeling as if I was in the way for an hour and a half. At no point did anyone explain to me that this was the club lounge and that I was free to enjoy the fare on offer. I'm not a presumptuous kind of person so I'd never just assume something like that. Finally the room was ready. What a treat. As a reward for my patience they very kindly upgraded us to a suite. It was quite unexpected and we were completely grateful for the gesture. However, the lost feeling continued every time one left the room. Nothing is sign posted or clearly marked and the hotel doesn't have a natural or intuitive flow to it. In fact, later that evening when we thought we'd check out the Ozone bar on 118 we ended up going through the service entrance again as that was the only door we could find. The looks we got from the cleaning lady, you can just imagine. So, in a nutshell, the place is spectacular but a little aloof and offish and it definitely left us feeling a bit \"unwanted\".

With business hotels, I have learnt even brand names don't guarantee great service or a great experience- sometimes over-crowding leads to delayed/ poor housekeeping, rude staff, lousy room service and so on. The Ritz Carlton Hong Kong (at Kowloon), however, was superb. The Management was strong and solved any issues promptly. We had been given 2 adjoining rooms as we travelled with our children and nanny, and the adjoining room was not a Twin Room as expected. We were told to wait 2 hours for the next available pair of King and Twin rooms to be available...which we were OK with, since we had not made our reservation requests clear from the start and could not fault the hotel for the oversight. After the 2 hours, the Management came up and personally over-saw our move to a complementary upgrade suite and adjoining twin room. It was a kind gesture we truly appreciated. Thereafter, we had no issues at all during our very pleasant stay. Room service was prompt, housekeeping was like clockwork and responded within 5 minutes for any requests, the children's room was specially set up with details like children's bath toys and soaps, robes/ slippers and so on. The pool was an incredible experience, with a wall panel of beach front images and ceiling of lighted \"sky\", and outdoor hot tub. We literally sat in a cloud and dipped in the warm water. The view was not great because of the cloudy weather, but this cleared up the following day and we enjoyed vast views of the city before us. The only negative experience I can recall would be of a local mother bringing her child with her to the steam room (which was really a 2-seater room), and the child obviously was unable to sit still in the heat for more than 30 seconds at a go- she kept getting up to open the door, go out, return etc and the room remained un-steamy to say the least...there seemed to be no governance over who or what age group was let into the facilities. The only other few points I would raise perhaps would be that the Ozone Bar was mainly patronized by middle aged tourists, and we had our more fun and hip drinking time at the W Hotel next door. The door greeters could not remember us as guests even thought we trooped in and out for 4 days (we would occasionally get \"Good Afternoon welcome back!\" and more often \"welcome to the Ritz Carlton\"...which was disconcerting...at other hotels such as the Four Seasons, greeters would always remember who was a room guest and not, and even call us by name).

Was a bit disappointed because my previous stayed in Conrad and Shangri-la had that little touch so expected Ritz to offer the same kind of little touches as well. The staffs were friendly and helpful. Response time was quick when I requested for extra bottled water. Would I stay in this hotel again?

I did try their pastries from the shop at the Lobby. They are very nice to look at and very pricey but have a very ordinary taste. Taxis are needed for transportation although there are buses and subway which may be a little confusing for a visitor in Hong Kong.

Unfortunately, due to its location to the main actions in HK and its set-up (details below) the hotel seriously lacks atmosphere. The Check-In Process: Depending on whether you are coming by car or by train (Kowloon Station), you first need to get to the hotel's entrance lobby on Level 9. The check-in desk is on Level 103 however. Depending on what time of year and day you happen to check in, it may take a while. I had to wait about 20 mins when I checked in at around 12:30pm as there were only 2 check-in staff behind the counter and a long queue of tourists wanting to exchange money, checking out, asking directions, etc. Once checked in, you need to take another elevator to get to your room. The Room: I was fortunate to be upgraded to the Grand Deluxe room facing out to the harbour on Level 113. The room was very nice and the view was very impressive as expected. The room was as described in the hotel's web site but it took me a bit of time to find out where everything was. The separate shower with the rain shower head was very nice. One thing that was missing surprisingly was the shoe tree given that there were several amenities for the shoes. When I travel on business, the only few amenities that I need are fast wireless internet access, free local phone and shoe tree. I did not need the extra TV in the bath tub, the iPod, the iPod/iPhone dock/spreaker or the double bathroom sinks. The hotel seems to have spent money on making the room luxury for tourists and less functional for business travellers. Being HK, it was cloudy on most of the days so I could hardly see anything outside from the room. The Pool: The pool was on Level 118 but it was disappointing. The view was not visible at night and the pool's set-up was a bit cramped by the fancy long chairs. It is an indoor pool so I wonder why anyone would need long chairs. The Breakfast: This was the most disappointing part of the hotel. Given its class, the breakfast was very average and nothing to write home about. You eat there for the view and not for the quality of food. The Location: The hotel is situated in the tallest office building linked to a mall. You spend a lot of time going up and down elevators and escalators. The restaurants in the building are limited and expensive and the shops are really for the wealthy tourists. In terms of quality of decor, amenities/facilities and staff helpfulness, this hotel ranked high (but not the best compared to other hotels). If my company was not located in this building and I was not on a business trip then I don't think I would stay here. When I stayed here, it felt a bit like a tourist attraction with herds of Chinese or Russian tourists with their expensive shopping.

We were than directed to the 103 floor. When we got to the 103 floor we were redirected to the 116 floor club lounge for check in. Surely they could have asked us at the hotel entrance whether or not we had a club reservation.

Service after that improved greatly; with the Club staff especially pleasant The view from the room was fantastic but it was a shame the windows are very dirty. The room itself was nice but no better than most other 5 star hotels in Hong Kong. You are definitely only paying for the view at the Ritz which is outstanding from the room, the Club Lounge and bar.

The room itself was well appointed with a great bathroom with a huge shower head and bath. laundry and room service was impeccable. Great pool and restaurants. The only two issues were that we tried to watch a movie on one of the 3 TV's in the room but found the system was down. When i called reception they said it was currently under repair and would be fixed soon. We never did get to see a movie. I guess one of the teething problems for such new hotel. The other issue is that you cannot walk from the hotel to where the action is. Even to get to Nathan road you need to take a taxi - which even though they are cheap- we found slightly annoying.

The bedding was great \u2013 very comfortable down and high thread counts. The bathroom was entirely set in stone with an enormous Jacuzzi tub and a shower with 2 shower heads (one above, one on pole). Good thing they have lots of hot water there because I didn\u2019t want to get out of the shower! We are Marriott Platinum Elite members and were recognized as such by the Ritz (a partner hotel).

When we came off the flight, 3 Ritz employees were waiting for us; ushering us through the airport and taking care of all our baggage, coats, etc. The drive was about 25 minutes and quite smooth.

When we got to the hotel, there were about 8 people outside waiting for us, including the front desk manager, concierge lounge manager, and several others. It was a whirlwind as they rushed us to the 1st set of elevators to go up to the lobby level. A single representative then escorted us to our room and showed us all the buttons and how-to\u2019s, as well as explaining all the hotel services, etc. while finishing our check-in. The buttons are really cool in these rooms \u2013 can push a single button to request service, to make \u201cdo not disturb\u201d, to turn off or on all lights, to open or close the drapes. I was thinking I could get used to that kind of thing. The concierge lounge is fantastic, and open 24 hours. It is very large and there is an extensive selection of food and drink. The foods are presented on a long island with Eastern foods on the left, and Western foods on the right. They make great omelets to order in the morning, and their pastries are perfect. I bake a lot, so I\u2019m a tough person to impress when it comes to pastries. I think I ate 5-6 different selections each morning, along with my omelet and a ton of fresh squeezed orange juice. They also have excellent tea service there. Hevre, the manager, and the attendants there in the lounge were a special part of our visit. They were incredibly attentive to us \u2013 refilling OJ, making pots of tea, etc. plus asking about our visit with a genuine interest that couldn\u2019t be faked. They helped us make many choices of sights to see, places to eat, and things to avoid. They made printouts and maps to help our days run more smoothly. I am truly grateful for their input and kindness. It felt like we had some friends in a foreign land and that was very comforting. FYI the lounge has breakfast in the morning, then appetizers in the evening and desserts at night. I think they take the bulk of it away around 11pm and then it\u2019s just drinks and cookies (in the cookie jars by the couches). I ate a lot of cookies too. MMMmmm. One other thing to mention\u2026 at this hotel, people run to help you. And I do mean it when I say run. It was like our maid was doing cartwheels down the hall to press our elevator button for us, or if we needed more tea in our tea pot the attendant ran to the kitchen. I\u2019d never seen anything like it \u2013 it was quite an experience. The odd thing is the people all seemed happy to do it. A few last notes: Room service was great \u2013 food quality and presentation excellent. We didn\u2019t eat at any of the restaurants because of the dress code. We\u2019re pretty casual people and it\u2019s just not our thing to get dressed up for dinner. The fitness area was spectacular and like nothing else we\u2019ve seen or even heard of. The pool had huge round lounges and the ceiling projected the sky for the time of day (blue sky and clouds during daytime). Bottom line: If you\u2019re on the fence about staying at the Ritz, go for it.

Although quite isolated for first timers and a bit of a schlep to get to the MTR through a shopping mall, we were glad we stayed here for 2 nights. Top of the attractions is Ozone, the world's highest bar - the cocktails were good and the views were incredible. I did wonder though when we were there, whether it was worth shelling out for a room when it is easy to access this bar for non-hotel guests. In fact there is a steady stream of visitors to this hotel and no separate lift for guests - it does seem a bit overcrowded at times. The superb levels of service make up for this. And while there may be some gloating at how visitors can get the views without paying thousands of dollars for the room - they miss out on the views at breakfast from the superb lounge area. There is also something said for being able to relax in one's own room and enjoy the views in privacy. We have travelled all around the world, but we commented that this was one of the first times we just sat and stared out of our hotel window. Unfortunately due to the thickness of the glass and the fact that the hotel is so high up - visibility can be poor and is nowhere near as impressive as the Intercontinental. The decor of the rooms though is exquisite - it was our first time at a Ritz Carlton hotel and it will be very hard to get accustomed to anything else. The bathroom was so luxurious - the size of the shower head the biggest we have ever seen - all part of the Ritz Carlton experience. THere is also a TV in the bathroom if you like that kind of thing. A very high tech hotel, you feel as if you are on the set of a James Bond movie at times. Incidentally, the lounge area is an excellent spot for some pre or post dinner cocktails. Service is at all times fast and efficient - the staff have been trained to the highest standards - as expected for the price you will be paying for this hotel. My only criticism is that at times, the Ritz seemed a bit too corporate and clinical.

The room size is fantastic! There is a working desk, a small living room, a bedroom and a huge bathroom. The amenities in the room are quite good. Mini fridge, ipod loaded with musics on docking speakers (one in bedroom + one in working desk), two large Lcds TV (one in living room + one in bedroom), magazines etc.. The bed is from Sealy and it is really heavenly!! The curtains are controlled electronically so you can draw them up with a topuch of your finger tips. The pillows are very good too. Complementary bottle waters are there with complementary newspaper and wifi in the room. There is also complementary fruits. Bathroom: The bathroom is simply gorgeous. It is of a very good size. It has two entrances. The first entrance is just next to the main door which leads you to the toilet. The next entrance is connected to the bedroom which is separated by sliding door. It has a nice bathtub with a head rest for you. So that you can soak comfortably and watched TV at the same time as there is a nice little in built TV facing the tub. However, I feel that the viewing height and angle of the TV is not good. I try soaking in the tub and I find at this angle, the TV show appears dark from my angle. Showering area is next to the bathtub with very generous rain forest shower. The bathing amenities are from Asprey. The towels are of good size and feel. There are two basins for you and partners. Services: When I arrive at the entrance lobby, someone helps me with my baggage and a lady escorts me to the hotel lobby at 103. Then, I was ushered to level 116 for personalized check in which is their club level. The staffs speaks good English, very attentive and friendly. The check in is pretty fast. Check out is equally quick at the same place. There is turn down services and they leaves some little chocolate which is housed in Ritz box. Amenities and breakfast Level 118 houses the swimming pool and the jacuzzi. There are 3 jacuzzi. Two indoor (hot + cold) and one outdoor (hot). I was there at night and there are not many people which is good. The swimming pool bathroom is spacious and the design is nice too. The toilet cubicles are all circular in shape. I have accessed to the 24 hours club and so far it has the most food presentation ever. Total 6 meals presentation daily! You basically can eat every second! Though no lunch and dinner, the snacks and drinks spread are quite good and you can easily filled up your stomach and forgo lunch and dinner. Breakfast selection is ok as expected due to lesser people on club floor. Hotel: The location of the hotel is quite good. A shopping mall - Elements is linked to this hotel. It is a pretty upscale mall where you can get all your favourite branded stuffs here with no queues. A cinema and ice skating rink can also be found here. There are also many eateries and cafes. If you decide to venture out, Kowloon MTR station is just underneath. Going to Airport is also extremely easy as the Airport express is just below and you can do city check in too at there!!! Very convenient. Verdict: Staffs are very friendly, helpful and attentive. A huge room with harhour views that are amazing. A shopping mall and MTR station connected.

Though I live in Hong Kong, with the re-opening of the Ritz Carlton at the top of the glitzy International Commerce Center of Kowloon, I was extremely curious as to the quality of the view (and of the hotel). There was, and to some extent remains, a tremendous amount of hype to the hotel and its restaurants, and it remains difficult to secure a reservation at its two restaurants. The rooms were very nice \u2013 modern, well-equipped and luxurious. The bed was great, and the bathrooms were spacious and comfortable. However, aside from Nespresso coffee machine at the minibar (with free capsules), I cannot say that anything in the room particular captivated my senses\u2026 aside from the magnificent view outside my window. Fate was smiling as we were blessed with sunny and clear days (as well as nights), which meant that we could enjoy the lovely view of Hong Kong island unimpeded by any unwanted elements. I also visited the popular bar/club Ozone, located at one of top floors. The only big negative I can offer is that since there was no elevator that goes directly to guestrooms \u2013 all guests for the restaurants, rooms, and Ozone had to pass through the lobby located on the 103 floor \u2013 it may be a little daunting, or downright embarrassing, for a hotel guest to saunter through the lobby in casual attire. I tried, and my shorts and slippers felt extremely out of place surrounded by dolled up individuals and groups looking to have a grand night out. +++: View: I\u2019ve been to the peak in Hong Kong more than once to show visiting friends around, but I have never seen Hong Kong Island like I saw it in this hotel room. The view from the room was a spectacle, and we were fortunate enough to be able to enjoy it without the presence of smog. One of the special moments included drinking a chilled bottle of champagne whilst admiring the night show and scenery. Absolutely magical (and romantic!). Bonus tip: to enjoy the same-ish scenery at a more earthly level, I would definitely recommend the lounge in Intercontinental Hotel (Salisbury Road) at Tsim Sha Tsui Rooms: Comfortable and luxurious rooms, while nothing out of this world, are more than worthy of the Ritz name. While I myself am more taken by the modern utility and convenience of rooms, this room also impressed my travel partner, whose tastes are a little more traditional and cozy. The Nespresso machine and a powerful ceiling shower were my favorite touches. ---: Location: Don\u2019t get me wrong, the Ritz is located atop Elements, a bustling mall with tons of restaurants and shopping choices, a cinema, and is even connected to a railway line that goes directly to the airport. But Hong Kong is much more than one mall, and in that sense the location may seem a little distant from the usual touristy haunts of Causeway Bay, Wan Chai, and Central (Lan Kwai Fong / Soho). And even if you\u2019re thinking of staying in Kowloon, hotels in Tsim Sha Tsui and Mongkok would definitely provide more cost-effective and convenient lodging. Identity crisis: The Ritz has established itself as a high-end food and drink destination (although I am not sure whether this status is deserved or not as I did not dine-in), and is a victim of its own success. Due to a high volume of fashionable people coming to the Ritz for the club and restaurants, guests might feel a little marginalized. Firstly, while the staff was always courteous, the high influx of non-hotel guests made the service feel forced and sterile. Secondly, being constantly surrounded by well-heeled individual made it difficult to relax in the lobby, or even feel comfortable wearing ultra-casual attire. Lack of free Wifi: One would think paying close to US$800 for a room would include free internet\u2026", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAmazing\u201d", "Author": "Daniela L", "ReviewID": "UR119670281", "Content": "Room, service, food, view, and location were nothing short of amazing.

Well let's look at the location. Occupying the 103-118th floors of Hong Kong's ICC building can have many benefits. It sits atop the Kowloon train station (MTR and airport express) so transportation is good... That is, unless you have luggage and a 4yr old in tow. I suspect your typical Ritz Carlton guest doesn't generally take public transport, so the hike from train to hotel can be quite arduous. (Think 6-8 flights of escalators + 2-3 elevator trips). Also, in terms of location, the shopaholic within cannot have any complains. With the elements mall within the complex, all mid-market to top notch name brands are accounted for. H&M to Ferragamo, you're covered. And then, there's the view. Did I mention 118 floors? We were assigned rooms on the 106th and if there's one thing that blows you away, (other than the bill at the end of the stay) it's the gorgeous views of all of Hong Kong on a clear day.\u00a0 On a typical day however, I fear the view may be limited by smog. At this juncture, assuming vertigo is not a concern, another great thing the hotel has going for it is the amenities. Anything you want ala the Ritz Carlton is available here... Nespresso machine check, Tv in bath check (double check if you're a 4 yr old), free wi-fi, remote curtains and proximity sensor key cards, check, check, check. Swimming pool on the 118th floor, heated till perfection with a view like no other, check mate. So, sounds great so far, and it was. The only reason I'm not giving this hotel a 5 star rating are twofold. 1) They already have an official 5 star rating so they probably don't need one from me and 2) I thought the service left a little to be desired. Check-in. Mechanical and not particularly welcoming. Here's your key, turn left, tap your key card, press 106, go to room, sleep. Don't call us, we'll call you. Check-out, efficient. Here's the bill. Where I didn't feel particularly welcomed was at the arrival lobby on the 9th floor. (that's where you get on these jet-propelled elevators which send you to #103). Here, they're all smiles when you leave, but of course they need to check your credentials when you arrive. \u00a0After all, not everyone should be entitled to ride in a jet-propelled elevator. My problem was that the same lady who greeted us so warmly coming down also seemed to want to stop us from going back up 2hrs later. Do I really need to explain that I stay there? It seems that the reason may be due to a throng of locals for high tea every weekend. They're meant to queue for hours on end at the arrival lobby and not use our rocket ships willy nilly. Also, I was half expecting that the Ritz would do something special for a 4yr old. Granted that this wasn't the Disneyland hotel, but these things matter to a parent! Tv in the bath notwithstanding, I got the impression that the Ritz didn't know what to do with a 4yr old... Is she gonna bite us? Will she know what to do with the chocolate we leave on her pillow? Oh lord she's got a stuffed toy. Erm what's that? The thing that took the star away: On our first night (15 Oct 2011), a fire alarm went off at 2.30 in the morning. (Did I mention I had a 4 year old in tow?) which is all well and good because fire alarms saves lives. I wasn't looking forward to a 106 floor climb down to safety, but i guess i would have if necessary... What REALLY annoyed me, was a string of announcements that followed saying that it was a false alarm. Repeatedly. In every language known to man. Repeatedly.\u00a0(Did I mention I had a 4 year old in tow?) of course, nobody took my calls, nobody heard my pleading for them to shut up and nobody could help me with my irate 4 year old. Of course in a hotel with the clinical efficiency of the Ritz, there was no further mention of the rude awakening. Any mention was met with a salute-like apology. Stoic, uniformed and reserved.

The Suite Dreams Package is described as \u201cDreams come true at The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong. Indulge in a romantic getaway with your beloved and create a memory that will last a lifetime.\u201d HUGE MISTAKE. I cannot emphasise enough how misleading this description is. Do NOT fall for this package. The description should in fact read, \u201cNightmares come true at The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong. Unromantic getaway with your beloved. Scar yourself with memories that will haunt you for a lifetime.\u201d The Suite Dreams Package is described as including an \u201carrival limousine transfer (any destination in Hong Kong)\u201d and an \u201c80-minute aromatherapy massage for two\u201d among other things. However, the service I received for both of these items was severely inadequate. Firstly, regarding the arrival limousine transfer, I was surprised to receive an email from the concierge a day before the actual transfer, informing me that the local transfer would be HK $450. Confused, I wrote back to enquire if the transfer was not already included in the price of the Suite Dreams Package. The concierge replied that it was indeed part of the package and apologised for the confusion. This was a teeny tiny blunder compared to what was to come. The limousine was to pick up me and my boyfriend at 1 PM the next day. To cut a long story short, the driver went to the wrong building, 5 minutes away from our place. When we realised that the driver had made a mistake, I informed him that our building was 300 metres down the street. He asked me to \u201cwait 5 minutes\u201d, which seemed a reasonable amount of time to cover that distance in a Mercedes-Benz. By the time the limousine arrived, it was 1:45 PM. We arrived at the hotel a minute or two past 2 PM. Upon arrival, the hotel staff came up with all kinds of excuses to explain the blunder and avoid blame. These excuses ranged from the management of my building not allowing the driver to wait there to the driver being held up by protesters en route to picking us up. None of their excuses were plausible. There has never been a problem with vehicles waiting before and our building even has a designated parking area for taxis and other pick-ups. Furthermore, the rather low frequency at which protest marches at lunch time on National Day occur in our residential neighbourhood makes the excuse of the driver being slowed down by protesters unlikely. Most importantly, given the fact that the driver himself had told me he was at a building just 300 metres down the street from ours, it should not have taken him more than 5 minutes maximum to drive to the correct pick-up location. By the time we were shown to our hotel suite, it was 2:10 PM and I had to cancel our 1:45 PM lunch reservation at Inakaya, a restaurant I had really looked forward to dining at and had reserved more than a month in advance. The restaurant had kindly been holding our table, but their kitchen was closing at 2:30 PM. The hotel compensated by arranging a table for us at The Lounge & Bar, one of its own outlets, where we ate a club sandwich and a pad thai on the house. This in no way made up for our disappointment at missing the chance to dine at Inakaya. What made matters even worse was the 80-minute aromatherapy massage \u201cfor two\u201d included in the Suite Dreams Package. After arriving at the spa, my boyfriend was led to the men\u2019s changing room and I to the ladies\u2019 to get changed for the massage. Imagine my shock when the therapist escorted me to a massage room for one person. I asked the therapist where my boyfriend was, and was told that we would be having our massages in separate rooms. This surprised me as the Suite Dreams Package is described as a \u201cromantic getaway with your beloved\u201d and separate massages in separate rooms is the exact opposite of romantic. I asked the therapist if there had been an error. The therapist informed me that to get a couple\u2019s room, I had to upgrade at a price of HK $900 or so. Since money was not an issue, I asked her to upgrade us to a couple\u2019s room right away. The therapist told me that the two couple\u2019s rooms were full and had to be booked in advance. My boyfriend and I ended up having the 80-minute aromatherapy massage \u201cfor two\u201d in separate rooms. Right after the massage, I postponed the romantic dinner \u201cfor two\u201d at Tosca by 30 minutes as I urgently needed to express my frustration with the massage as well as my growing fear that the dinner would be just as disastrous as the massage experience. By phone, I told the duty manager that any reasonable person would assume that the aromatherapy massage \u201cfor two\u201d included in the Suite Dreams Package would be in a couple\u2019s room since the package is described as a \u201cromantic getaway with your beloved\u201d. He apologised and told me that he would check what the Suite Dreams Package should include. I also informed him that after the separate and unromantic massages that my boyfriend and I had, I was extremely distressed that we would be seated at separate tables for the romantic dinner \u201cfor two\u201d at Tosca. He assured me that he would personally see to it that the dinner arrangements would be up to standard. Fortunately, it turned out that my boyfriend and I were indeed seated at the same table for dinner. However, the damage had already been done by the unromantic and separate massages, which was now the second part of our package that had not been properly executed, causing distress and anxiety for me on what else would go wrong, and I could hardly enjoy dinner that night. As we sat down for dinner, we asked for the wine list. We never got it and were served ros\u00e9 champagne on the house instead, in addition to an extra dessert near the end of our meal. I appreciate the gesture, but knowing that my boyfriend does not like ros\u00e9 wine and I generally don\u2019t drink alcohol at all, I would much rather have chosen a wine to my boyfriend\u2019s liking from the wine list. As for the extra dessert, it was delicious but unnecessary as we already had dessert included as part of our meal. After careful consideration more than a month in advance, I chose The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong to celebrate my boyfriend\u2019s birthday weekend over other five-star hotels such as The Peninsula and The Mandarin Oriental. Being a newly opened and much talked-about hotel with a world-class reputation, I was confident that this was where we would experience, according to the hotel slogan, an \u201celevated luxury lifestyle\u201d. However, this was not the case. My biggest complaint is, of course, the 80-minute aromatherapy massage \u201cfor two\u201d in separate rooms. I can honestly say that I did not enjoy a single second of the 80-minute massage as I was simply too much in shock wondering how the hotel could market the Suite Dreams Package as romantic. Any guest will assume that a spa treatment that is part of a \u201cromantic package\u201d is to be enjoyed by a couple, together in the same room without the need to book an additional upgrade to a couple\u2019s room in advance \u2013 and for HK $900. However, since this is not the case, the hotel is seriously misrepresenting the Suite Dreams Package and misleading its guests. As for the gestures made by the hotel staff to apologise for the blunders, all I can say is too little too late. The lunch on the house to make up for the lunch my boyfriend and I missed at Inakaya and the additional items that were given to us at Tosca after the bungled separate and unromantic massages do not make up for the fact that I was severely distressed during the 45-minute wait for the limousine, disappointed at missing our lunch at Inakaya and, worst of all, spent an agonising 80 minutes during the massage, separated from my boyfriend, wondering how things could have gone so wrong and terrified of what the next blunder was going to be. I started planning my boyfriend\u2019s surprise weekend getaway more than a month in advance, but it turned out to be nothing like I had envisioned it to be. The only member of staff I felt was naturally hospitable and welcoming was Mr Nils Bergh\u00e4user at The Lounge & Bar. On the actual day of my boyfriend\u2019s birthday, he kindly escorted us to a table with the best view in the entire restaurant where we had complimentary champagne and a mini birthday cake with our breakfast. I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank him for making us feel welcome during our last meal before checking out. However, one hospitable member of staff is not enough to ever make me want to return to The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong. I had one chance to make my boyfriend\u2019s birthday weekend special and to \u201ccreate a memory that will last a lifetime\u201d, as the Suite Dreams Package is advertised. I will definitely remember my weekend at The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong, but not in the way I had hoped. The front office manager gave me his name card as I was checking out, asking me to call him to arrange a romantic dinner the following weekend to make up for all the blunders. His gesture, no matter how well intended, simply cannot make up for the fact that my boyfriend\u2019s romantic birthday getaway was an absolute catastrophe. The hotel staff had their chance to make this past weekend spectacular for me and my boyfriend and failed us miserably. Not only did they ruin the entire weekend, but they also ruined the actual day of my boyfriend\u2019s birthday as I remained in a miserable mood instead of the celebratory mood I had hoped to be in. I do not see why I should give the staff the chance to ease their conscience. Guests who choose to stay at The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong, choose to do so because they expect top-notch service. I no longer have such expectations from The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong. I warn any couple looking for a romantic getaway NOT to choose The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong\u2019s Suite Dreams Package. Doing so will cause you grief as I learnt the hard way.

There isn\u2019t a proper supper but you can help yourself to cookies, chocs and beverages. They have a selection of 4 reds and 4 white wines, international beers, champagne, soft drinks and juices.

Complimentary use of computer, internet and phone for local calls. There is a decent library with a TV.

There was one occasion after 11pm when I couldn\u2019t access the Club Lounge with my electronic card key as it was not working. I was subsequently let in by Phoebe who had already finished her shift for the night at 11pm. The next day when she saw me, she approached me, offered to change my card key and apologized for the inconvenience of the night before. I had thought she wouldn\u2019t have remembered. Ditzy Suite design was ditzy and doesn\u2019t look spacious. As you step into your suite, there is a side door which opens into the water closet (WC) area and a wash basin. This is linked to your main bathroom area as well as to your bedroom. The suite proper leads you to the minibar, nespresso area before the work desk area which is obstrusively situated in the middle of your living room. The bedroom is located near the end of the living room and with sliding door partitions from the living room and bathroom. Disappointed that a cupboard was provided and not a walk in wardrobe. As pointed out by one contributor, if the cupboard door is open, it blocks your way to the bathroom area. Also, if you open the door to the WC area, it blocks access to one of the wash basins in the bathroom. Instead of a wash basin in the WC area, I think a bidet would have been better. Although, I had indicated to Reservations that I had a child accompanying me, no child amenities were provided. It was only on the 2nd day that they provided a child bathrobe (too small) and a bath towel. Altho, i was shown to my room by a Reservations Lady, i thought she could have taken the trouble to give me a quick orientation of the room and its amenities as some top hotels do. As I was meeting friends in HongKong, I didn\u2019t get a chance to try the F&B outlets at the Ritz. Had no problems with the key card (the trick is to hold the key card long enough and in the correct zone of the scanner) and waiting time for lift was OK. Altho, i booked a club room, i didnt check in at the club lounge. In any case, there wasnt any queue and check in was fast and hassle free. Luggage wass promptly delivered Practical Information Conveniently located above the Kowloon MTR station with direct access from the Airport. Walking time to the Ritz is between 10-12 minutes. Just follow the directional signs once you are in Elements Mall (mall with premium outlets like Louis Vuitton). There are plenty of shops and restaurants, even Starbucks, a cinema, ice skating rink in the Mall. You can access certain other parts of Kowloon and HongKong island taking the free airport express buses located near the MTR station.

But after staying at another the newly opened Ritz Carlton (this time in Hong Kong in April 2011), I have decided that I should stop being a glutton for punishment and be a little bit more patient. The Arrival. Firstly, finding the entrance to the hotels was an adventure in itself. I am very familiar with HK and it's landmarks, but finding the entrance was a trip. The main entrance from the mall / MTR was closed and still under construction. The only way in was from another level through countless escalators. There were no signs ... only a piece of paper taped to the wall. After finally reaching the lobby, you were stopped by young ladies holding an iPad. I understand the feeling the hotel is trying to create with technology, but it was a little unnecessary as each name had to be checked off on the \"list\" before allowed entry. As we stayed on the Club Level, we were escorted to the Club Level check in where it was pretty cut and dry. It took about 5 minutes and we were taken to our room. I read some reviews where check in was a mess, but I think I lucked out because I stayed there during the first few weeks of its opening and the hotel was only about 30% full. The Room. When you step into the room, the name Ritz Carlton does not come to mind. It seems more like a modern boutique hotel or a Mandarin Oriental. I've stayed at countless Ritz Carltons around the world and you come to expect a certain decor and style. The HK Ritz is quite different with straight lines, minimalist furniture and a very transparent bathroom. It wasn't my cup of tea, but hey, I just needed a place to sleep...I wasn't going to live there permanently. But what bugged me the most was the fact that the toilet didn't really flush. You would actually have to flush at least 4-5 times before the toilet paper disappeared. The Service. The service was definitely lacking and I attributed it to the fact that it was a new hotel and everyone was still scrambling around...for what you ask? I don't know. You were either greeted in Mandarin (which is wild, because you're in HK where people speak Cantonese and not Mandarin) or greeted by a person who was so unhappy to work there that you wanted to tell them that they should just quit their job already. There are a few other reviews where guests encountered the same thing. It's just very odd. What was even funnier was an incident where I was in the elevator when it opened on one of the levels and the GM had quickly peeked in and saw some people and then quickly retreated trying not to be noticed. He actually tried to hide and not come in...there were only 2 people in the elevator at that time. I can only guess he didn't want to hear all the negative comments guest had. Oh, and how did I know her was the GM? I saw the same guy in the lobby minutes later with his name tag on. I guess he took the next elevator. The Dining. Extremely lack luster and disappointing. Even the food at the Club Level was dry and aged. We had breakfast there and the choice was small and very minimal. We dined at the Cafe Lounge downstairs and the food was extremely overpriced for the quality and quantity you received. I think that the kitchen was still tweaking everything because the people next to us had complained about their food so much that they were given complimentary meals. The Departure. We checked out at the Club Level and everything seem to be painless until they overcharged for our stay by HK$1000 (US$150). Of course they denied that we were overcharged. In return, we showed them our reservation confirmation. The gentleman insisted that our reservation was incorrect, but out of courtesy, he would check. We had timed our check out to give ourselves about 20 minutes just in case something happened. We had given him a copy of the Ritz reservation for him to research the issue, but it still took him about 25 minutes to tell us he still didn't know. He would need to wait for the Reservation Desk and would email us any information he got. And of course, we were late, so we had to leave. At the airport, we received an email from the gentleman stating that they had indeed made a mistake and would reverse the charges on the invoice. Ironically, on that same revised invoice, there was a new charge of HK$25 (US$3.00) from the dining room that was billed to our room AFTER our check-out and departure. You're all probably thinking I'm petty to gripe about US$3, but it wasn't mine! I wasn't even on the premises at that time. To make a long story short (too late), it took me 2 months to sort the invoice out. Again, they had no clue as to how the new charges showed up, but it was another error. So...in conclusion, I would not recommend staying at new hotels. Even companies like the Ritz need time to work out the kinks in their system.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dhaka City, Bangladesh", "Title": "\u201cThe views make it.

We usually stay at the W Hotel but this time we wanted to try something new, so we chose the RC because it also has direct access to the Elements mall and the airport train at Kowloon station. We stayed in a Club Room with island / harbor view, and although the room was a bit small it was enough for one night. Next time we might choose the Junior Suite. The view from the room is stunning and it is well worth paying a bit more to get the Hong Kong island view!! The Club Lounge is located on the 116th floor with stunning views. They serve breakfast, snacks and drinks all day, afternoon tea, evening canapes, late night dessert and all night snacks. The lounge is open 24h/day. There could be more staff at the lounge though, as now they were almost nonexistent and service quite slow. But the breakfast and evening canapes were both very good. We arrived early in the evening and had dinner at the hotel's Italian restaurant located on the 101st floor (also with stunning Hong Kong skyline views). The food and service was very good! The hotel interior design and public spaces are among the most beautiful, sophisticated and modern we have seen ever. The amount of details and decorations is amazing. Nothing has been left for chance, and every small detail has been thought through and has been put there for a reason. It is really a state-of-the-art design hotel, not at all like the usual Ritz Carlton hotels. The innovative style, impeccable taste and in-depth understanding of art, fashion, trends are impressive.

You wait and wait and wait and I sometimes i thought that perhaps there should be a dedicated lift for the hotel guests. The lift cards were a constant problem in not scanning to the requested floor.

Not good when there are people in the corridor at midnight. It's a problem that the hotel might want to solve.

I had also arrived just in time for afternoon tea, and sat in the lounge for sometime to enjoy the incredible views and wide variety of teas, sandwiches, biscuits, and fruit. Breakfast the next morning was delicous while seated at a window-side table with a wonderful view of Hong Kong below. The guest room was modern, clean, and felt more like walking into someone's home due to the spaciousness and a configuration of the corner room, which overlooked Central, Lantau Island, and the New Territories. While the view was spectacular, the bathroom was pure luxury with a deep soak tub and shower stall with a rain showerhead of incredible size and water pressure. I liked the TV monitor hidden behind the bathtub mirror. The sink area had a long light that illuminates right through the lower edge of the sink counter serving as a nice subtle night light/mood lighting. The bath products were by Asprey. The bedroom and the bed was incredible and very comfortable. The drapes system was electric operated. There was a nice small sofa for gazing out the window and a telescope to view distant places. There was a nice desk, art work, Nespresso machine, and minibar. Even the artwork in the room was special. Besides the club I really loved the pool and hot tubs on Floor 118. The pool had projecdtion screens on the far wall and on the ceiling that was interesting to look at and add an added dimension to what is usually boring indoor pools.

We have stayed in a number of Ritz Carlton hotels around the world and this is certainly a stand out. As with all Ritz Carltons, everything is luxurious and modern and with this hotel, they've not spared any expense. Upon arrival you are met with very friendly bell staff who take your luggage immediately, whilst someone else escorts you up to the reception level. Our booking included the Club Lounge, so check in was done on Level 116, with exceptional service greeting us straight away. We arrived earlier than expected so our room wasn't quite ready so we waited in the lounge, enjoying the drinks, snacks - and the view! Our room was ready very quickly and when we entered we were completely awestruck. The view of the harbour from our room (level 115) was absolutely spectacular. The floor to ceiling windows (with window seats) allow a completely unobstructed view of Hong Kong, which is obviously second to none. The room itself was great, with everything you would expect from a Ritz - huge rain shower and lovely large bathroom, comfy bed with loads of pillows and even an Ipod pre-loaded with about 2500 songs. There's also a nice armchair where you can take in the night skyline and enjoy the nightly lightshow. We had cocktails at Ozone bar, which is just amazing. The atmosphere is very young and trendy, which isn't necessarily what people expect of a Ritz, however if this isn't your kind of bar, there is a more sedate lounge/cocktail bar on level 102 you can enjoy. Cocktails are actually very reasonably priced and served by very attentive staff. If your room doesn't have a harbour view, head to Ozone, which is on the rooftop (level 118). Again, the view is fantastic! We also had dinner at Tosca, the Italian restaurant on level 102, and although there have been mixed reviews about the meals, decor and surrounds, we thought it was wonderful. We had a window seat and enjoyed great wine and wonderful food, again served by wonderful staff. The comments about being watched by customers at the Chocolate Library above Tosca are unfounded - they're not watching you, they're appreciating the view outside!! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Ritz Hong Kong and will definitely stay again. We really also need to highlight how good the Club Lounge is. Although it costs a little more, it is worth every cent. It's open almost 24 hours a day (closed for only about 30 mins), where you can enjoy food, drinks and privacy from the crowds. The attentive staff make you feel welcome 100% of the time and go out of their way to help you. Herve Yen absolutely deserves a special mention, he is extremely friendly and helped with a number of things - least of all securing our booking at Tosca at short notice, when bookings are taken 2 months in advance! When compared to other Hong Kong hotels, the Ritz Carlton is expensive. However, you simply can't compare this hotel to any other - it's in a class of its' own and you can see exactly what you're spending that extra money on.

In fact, the hotel is just minutes away by car from Nathan Road or Canton Road where the major activities are. Or, you can take the MTR, which is accessible through the lower level of the shopping mall, and travel one stop will take you to the IFC Mall in Central, Hong Kong island.

The moment we got inside our room, which was the Premier Island Suite, we were drawn immediately to the panoramic view of the Victoria Harbor. It was a cloudy day but what in front of our eyes was still the most spectacular view we have even seen of our city. We were very impressed. On the other hand, the room itself was a disappointment. Our room could be connected with the one next door and there is a very odd and useless space at the entrance. A short corridor leading to a long and narrow living room. Half of the living room is occupied by a large working desk. The remaining space is just too small for a sofa and they put a lounge chair in front of the TV instead. Watching TV lying sideway on the lounge chair was very uncomfortable. There is no walk-in closet. The floor to ceiling wardrobe with 2 big leaf doors inside the bedroom is a design failure. Every time we opened the door, the road to the bathroom was blocked. Fortunately, the bathroom is nice. However, at this room rate, we expected more comfort. We had access to the club lounge which is opened 24hrs. There is a dress code for the lounge which is smart casual, but no one cares to enforce it. We saw guest from Mainland China wearing pajamas like t-shirt with short and slipper from the room (yes, the white terry-cloth one with the RC logo) using the lounge. We don't understand why they bother with a dress code when the staff didn't even turn away guests in the hotel slipper. Be prepared to meet quite a number of those when you stay in this hotel.

Judging from the facilities as well as the treatment quality, we definitely recommend the Espa at the Peninsula over the one here.

I rated this hotel average because the suite did not meet our expectation and the spa is far below the standard of a luxurious hotel.

F&B outlet - Friendly and Fun Poolside - Helpful and friendly! Misc: Decor - The decoration is Okay. Looks a bit like the ones in Macau actually... Pool - Great Pool at 118/F with an interesting LED Screen, showing a beach image and sometimes an undersea image. Jacuzzi - at the top of the highest building in Hong Kong! Awesome!

My husband made the reservation and had informed them ahead of time that it was an anniversary celebration. At the reception desk my husband was asked for his Hong Kong ID and I presented mine as well, the receptionist's response was, \"Oh are you staying here too?\" Ummm, why else was I standing there with an overnight bag?! Our room had a greeting card from the GM addressed only to my husband congratulating him on his wedding anniversary and thanking him for choosing the Ritz! The room was nice, the view was fabulous from the 113th floor. We had the full Hong Kong Central view as well as TST harbour. Amenities from Asprey Purple Water, comfortable bed, sufficient towels and very clean rooms. We did notice however our clothes were damp in the closet so perhaps the air conditioning isn't enough to act as a dehumidifier. The hotel is decorated to the hilt! It's an over the top, over done, over glitzed show piece. Someone was given free reign in a decorator's showroom and rather than make a few key choices they went crazy and cleared the floor and shelves of every design element! There's glass, chrome, marble, lazer cut metal, Swarovski crystals, Swarovski crytals, Swarovski crystals, water features, lit up flooring, glass curtains, sand blasted sculpted walls.... just too, too much. It's a hotel more fitting for Macau than Hong Kong. It's 70's decor reincarnated in a horrible way. The mainland Chinese love it though because they are EVERYWHERE! Service was good, the staff are friendly and helpful. We went up to Ozone for a pre- dinner drink, very young hip crowd again the view up there was beautiful and it was an experience. However sitting down at one of the sofas meant you have to spend a minimum of $15,000 HKD. We had dinner at Tosca. Fantastic food, fantastic service the only let down was the constant assault of flashes from cameras overhead due to the restaurants location. Tosca sits one floor below the check-in reception area which is open to the restaurant below. There is a constant flow of people overhead posing for photos and taking photos of the restaurant, this becomes very disconcerting as one is dining. At one point a group of 6 European tourists were lead into the dining room and they promptly stood around our table (we had a window side table) taking photographs of the harbour view as we were trying to enjoy our dinner!!! My husband saw them being lead in by the restaurant receptionist and had assumed they were there for dinner but they only wanted to take photos. I'm glad I experienced it but I would not chose to return to the Ritz. It's a mistake to design a hotel that fights against the beautiful harbour view rather than compliment it.

We just left the hotel last night after a romantic weekend and I immediately made another reservation for the next weekend! I have never been in such a spectacular hospitality environment and so far this is the best Ritz Carlton we've ever stayed at (we have about 15 major trips per year in 4-5* hotels)! After reading all the reviews about this hotel I believe more than ever that some people love to be unhappy and complain about everything. Whatever, their loss. This hotel is an amazing demonstration of perfect service chain, from check-in to check-out and follow ups. We arrived by express train from the airport (most convenient) and it was a short walk to the Ritz. When I entered the hotel I was immediately surrounded by a sea of smiles and genuine welcome greetings! The concierge himself accompanied us to the front desk office on the 103rd floor and was extremely pleasant and informative. At the front desk, the very lovely and mostly efficient Dorothy gave us the room key, walked us to the elevator, all smiles and impeccable posture. Our room was spectacular! The most impressive interior design, state of the art bathroom, TV in the tub (a dream come true), technology for every single need, perfect coffee and tea maker, superb linen and the VIEW!!! OMG!!! WHAT A VIEW! We also received a delicious chocolate cake as a welcome gift from the GM since this was a special anniversary for us. Ten minutes later, while I was still in awe with the beauty of the room, we got a call from Miss Dorothy from front desk who took the liberty to send me some hot tea with lemon and water since she noticed that I'm fighting with a really laryngitis! How about that? We went in the evening to the Ozone club. Great venue, very classy, young crowd and good cocktails. And the service just as perfect as everywhere else. The club lounge is a MUST! Delicious food all day and again, the service! I teach service for a living and so far I have never seen such an impressive team! They also acknowledge that I don't have a voice due to my laryngitis and they started to fuss around me with hot water and lemon and advices! I have never been happier to be sick! Really! oh, and i should mention, late in the evening, I was sent up in the room again hot tea, lemon and honey and a special advice from the room service manager on how to take care of my health! The next day, we had a beautiful breakfast in the club level. I have noticed that the guests also seemed to be very happy and smiling. Everybody seemed to be very friendly and a lot of spontaneous conversations started among the guests. We met a few very nice people and one of the guests noticed that I cannot speak and she went to the chef and asked him to prepare me a special chinese porridge that works miracles! again, i felt like my laryngitis was a blessing in disguise! Everybody in the staff was constantly checking up on all the guests (without being too invasive). Everybody that we spoke with was very, very impressed with the hotel. For lunch I went by myself to the Lounge and I had a superb table by the window. Jason, my waiter was one of the most respectful and pleasant gentleman that I had the pleasure to meet. The food was amazing and I chose from the Asian menu whatever he recommended since I was not familiar with all the food items. Let me say, I had the best soy sauce in the world! The apple tart desert was divine! The pool and the gym are beyond imagination! It feels like you are somewhere on a different planet! I tried the pool, the steam bath and the hot tub outside and I almost cried when I had to leave :)) We made a reservation in the evening in the Chinese restaurant and since they knew we are celebrating, we received a special table by the window and a special menu designed for us!!!! We didn't even have to order anything! The champagne, offered by the management was ready for us when we arrived and minutes later, Mr.Cristiano Rinaldi, the hotel manager came to greet us in person. Useless to say, that was the best Chinese food we ever had and I will never be able to eat chinese food in USA without a sad face! If at this point you reader are still unimpressed, how about this? Later, when we returned to our spectacular room, I noticed a gift on the table. Jason, the waiter from the lounge sent me a complimentary bottle of the soy sauce that I liked so much! The check-out was just as pleasant! Miss Dorothy was there, asking about my health. Even the hotel manager, who just walked by came over to ask if I'm feeling better since he has heard that I was under the weather (it was really just a laryngitis!). Miss Tracey Oliver personally walked us out and waited for our car to arrive. When she waived good buy along with the concierge gentleman, I felt like I'm leaving family! So, enough to say that I am crazy about this place. The property is really amazing but would be just a cold, empty, superb place without the extraordinary staff of the Ritz Carlton! We were supposed to go to Singapore for the weekend and try the Raffles Hotel but honestly, last night I canceled the plans and I just emailed Miss Tracey asking her to make us a reservation for this following weekend!

However, as I entered the hotel, the hotel staffs gave me a long face, stopped me and did not allow me to go on to the lift lobby. The staffs told me that they must check on their iPad if I \"really\" held a room reservation. It was odd since I had a carry-on luggage with me so obviously I was checking-in to the hotel. 5-10 minutes wasted here. Once they confirmed that I \"REALLY\" had a reservation, they allowed me to go up to the 103rd floor main lobby. As I got off the lift, I was approached by a female staff, and she pointed me to go to the reception desk on the left hand side. Since I was booked on the club floor, I told her that I wanted to go up to the club lounge to check-in. The request was denied (or may be she did not understand English), and she forced me to go to the reception, Communist Chinese Beijing Friendship Store style if you get the picture. At the reception, the receptionist asked for my passport which I presented. After a few minutes, he goes \"Oh, you have a reservation on the club floor, go up to the club lounge to check-in!!!!!\". That staff at the lift lobby! Another 5-10 minutes wasted here. Finally, I was allowed to go up to the club lounge to check-in. The check-in process at the club lounge was uneventful since that lady who took care of me was very competent and had no problem communicating in English. However, it took standard 5-10 minutes here again, so at the end of the day, it took me half an hour to get to my assigned room from the entrance of the hotel. Why not just have the reception on the ground floor?! After 15.5 hours flight direct from New York, it was very unpleasant to go through this unnecessary experience. It was a loooooong way from the ground floor to the room. Anybody who plans to stay here MUST be prepared for it since it is really a pain. The decor of the hotel is very Dubai, Main Land China kitsch. I do not particularly fancy this \"in your face\" decor but one might appreciate it. The room I stayed in was small, definitely not 50 square metres as advertised. It felt much smaller. It had 40 square metres at best. The marble top of the sink in the bathroom was cracked in a very obvious area, poorly amended. They stayed cheap. The toilet was running the whole time but didn't bother me that much since I wore ear plugs to go to sleep. No ice bucket placed at turn down. Asprey bathroom amenties were nice. Nice couple of chocholates placed at turndown. The food presentation during the cocktail hour was shamefully shabby. There was very little choice. There were some cheeses but no bread or crackers. Some strange tartare of something with salmon roe on it and hot and sour soup! Very down to earth western Chinese takeaway choice!!! Breakfast presentation was decent. Coffee was do it yourself Nespresso, kind of a cheap machine for a Ritz-Carlton Club lounge to be honest. It made a decent cup of espresso nonetheless. I wrote all of above on a comment card but nobody replied to me. I wrote 2 emails to the Guest Recognition Manager, but I was not recognised and ignored. I sorted to email the General Manager, but again, casually ignored until I sorted to contact the headquarters in the US. Like the other traveller mentioned, the GM is not a great responder. And it seems that it is the case top down. Don't get me wrong, though, 60% of the staffs I dealt with seemed genuinely trying to make you happy. The location of the hotel is remote, and you cannot walk to anywhere except to the Element Mall downstairs. If you plan to have a chauffeur driven car all the time, the location is a none issue, but for someone who need to go outside of ICC/Elements complex, it is unbelievably inconvenient. I suppose there is an Airport Express or Tung Chung line that goes to Central but I did not try since I was extremely tired and lazy. Bottom line: Unless you are to sightsee the \"highest hotel in the world\", staying one night only, it is BEST TO AVOID this new Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong and stick to the Peninsula, the Mandarin Oriental (old and new) or the Four Seasons as it is seriously inconvenient (unless you are doing business with Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley or Credit Suisse whose offices are in the building) and the service is mediocre at best. It is also a HUGE hassle to get to the room from the ground floor taking two different lifts changing on the 103rd floor. Half of the building is facing the wrong side and has an ugly view. The rooms are much smaller than advertised.

I have been watching the tower go up, during my many visits to the region over the past five years, so I decided that I would make it a point of staying there as soon as possible, booking my room the day they opened the website to reservations. Upon arrival on the 22nd April the hotel was a little over three weeks old, but in fairness to the team all was well and besides dirty windows, none of the normal opening blues I expected was experienced. I was met at the airport by three members of staff who were waiting for me at the Customs exit into the arrival hall, my baggage was immediately taken from me and I was led to the hotel car area, a minutes walk away. Waiting for me was the hotels Silver Rolls Royce Phantom registration number PJ 1113. The driver introduced himself, and upon driving off asked if I was in a hurry to get to the hotel, or if I preferred the scenic 'taking it easy' route, I chose the latter relaxed option. He also apologised for the incorrect pronunciation of my name \u2013 I have one of those horrible last names, and quickly called the hotel to say he had Mr xxxx safely onboard. The drivers English was excellent and his ability to converse on topics relevant to my country in an informed manner was impressive. The drive was over all to soon and we had arrived on level 9 at the ICC tower. The door was opened for me by Kit from the club lounge, who welcomed me to the hotel and further introduced me to the manager on duty who was also waiting for me. I wanted to take some arrival pictures, he immediately offered to do the honors, reassuring me he was camera friendly, correctly identifying my camera model and subtly letting me know he had a model one up on that. Photo's done I was escorted into the lobby and all the doormen and the elevator police greeted me by name pronounced correctly \u2013 no doubt thanks to the drivers earlier call. We travelled 52 seconds up to level 103 where he pointed out the check in area, concierge, restaurants and the led me to the guest lifts and we immediately went up to floor 115 where I was given the option to choose between room 115-19 facing to the South East or 115-25 facing South West, I ended settling on 115-19. Check in was effectively a case of giving me the key cards to my room (proximity type not magnetic stripe), asking for one signature and to see my passport, it cannot get any easier than that. In your room at your own desk without queues or forms I cannot see an easier option. Facilities in the room and hotel were clearly explained and for breakfast I was offered 3 options, option 1 in the Lounge and Bar on floor 102, option 2 in the club lounge or, Option 3 BOTH! The room itself is fairly ordinary, king bed, work desk, comfy lounge chair, large screen LED HD television, blu ray player, large cupboards and a bathroom with double vanity, separate shower, and deep bath with television. The difference is in the quality, having slept in far too many hotel beds I can safely say that this hotel has the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. The internet connectivity (complimentary of course) is incredibly fast. And then of course the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is the view, simply unbeatable, even when compared to the view at the peak. The view itself is reason enough to stay at the hotel, I ended up staying in a harbour view room, but could safely recommend a view to any direction, they are all amazing! For some reason I preferred the view slightly lower down on 102, compared to that of my room on 115 or at the pool at 118. Personal choice I guess, but no need to demand a high up room. The Ritz Carlton club lounge on 116 has amazing views with snacks and drinks on offer 24/7. The lounge also features complimentary usage of their computers, concierge and express checkout. Meals are as follows: Breakfast 06h30 \u2013 10h30, light snacks 11h30 \u2013 14h00, high tea 15h00 \u2013 17h00, hors d'oeuvres 17h30 \u2013 19h30, desserts 20h30 \u2013 22h30 and late night snacks 23h00 \u2013 06h00. Great service was received from Phoebe and Kit in the lounge at all times, again always addressed by name, with just enough interaction to be friendly yet not intrusive. Special mention has to be made of Mr Herve Yen the manager at the lounge, unlike most managers he is hands on, and not above rudimentary jobs like clearing tables, yet he is always willing to chat, assist and is genuinely welcoming and friendly. He even specially ordered to the lounge a meal not on the menu without blinking an eye. The quality of all foods was of an extremely high standard. My only concern is that the additional cost for lounge access is simply not justifiable, the lounges at other hotels have far more on offer. Simple things like a wider selection for non drinkers, and more plain snacks, even as basic as crisps comes to mind. Breakfast at the Lounge and Bar was incredible, the selection both Western and Asian vast, matched with friendly, prompt and professional service. The view at breakfast was by far the biggest highlight, you sit on a bench side by side and look out over the harbour to Hong Kong island, incredible! On one morning I took my camera to breakfast and as was each morning met by Winky, who of her own offered to take me around the entire 102 floor for photo's after breakfast. A small detail that really makes you feel welcome. I also ate at Tin Lung Heen the chinese restaurant. Food and service was good, although pricey and in a city like Hong Kong difficult to recommend with so many other great and in my opinion much better options. Next time I will try Tosca. The swimming pool on the roof deserves special mention, a regular pool is located indoors with a digital LED roof and wall, simulating blue skies and whisper clouds for the perfect tropical island atmosphere irrespective of the weather outside. A hot pool and a near freezing plunge pool are also on offer, the later impossible to enjoy for more than a few minutes unless your name is Vladimir, Yuri or Alexi. The hot tub outside is awesome. Changing rooms, with sauna, showers, bottled water, large towels and slippers are provided. One small complaint here is that the slippers are not suitable for western feet, and are probably a size 7 or 8, they should have some size 10 or even 11 available. The gym is also on level 118, ample modern equipment is available with the cardio equipment having TV, Internet, Facebook, and twitter access. At all times I was recognised and greeted by name on level 9, 103 and in the lounge, despite shift changes, a feat worth mentioning. Further a colleague who joined me; a South African born Chinese was always greeted in English, something he appreciated as he is usually addressed in Cantonese in Hong Kong. Overall the experience at the hotel was very good, but unfortunately not without flaws. Sadly for a hotel which has pitched itself at such a high level, in both price and hype I have to be more critical than what I would be of other hotels in Hong Kong. For first time visitors the location at Kowloon station is far from convenient, with the exception journeys to central station, Disney or the outlet shopping, and big Buddha at Tung Chung. Journeys to TST, Jordan, YMT and Mongkok require the use of a taxi, and destinations along the island line other than central require a longish walk between the lines. The station at Kowloon although in the basement is also a fair walk requiring travel on two elevators and seven escalators. Unless you have carry on luggage I would not advocate using the Airport express either as you are on your own to the hotel lobby. For late flights home, like mine at midnight, I do however recommended checking in at Kowloon station, you can simply drop off your luggage, get your boarding card and spend the rest of the day enjoying the city heading to the airport at only 9:30pm. A major gripe however is day visitors visiting the hotel, this is the source of untold annoyance as they clog up the lobby, and crowd the elevators. I would recommended the hotel starts a queue on level 8 at the entrance to the hotel from elements and reserves one elevator for them, the other three can be used exclusively by actual guests. Currently the elevator police only call the elevator once a sufficient group have gathered, this happens on level 9 and 103. As a guest I do not want to wait, I also got the impression at times that not all elevators where in service. Personally I believe non guests should go to the observatory in the building, if they want to enjoy the view, and not pretend to be interested in a drink at the bar. I had wanted to bring this up with Mark DeCocinis as he invited contact in my welcome letter, but didn't want to be petty. However after trying to make reservations for Tin Lung Heen unsuccessfully as they were sold out, I decided to raise my concerns with him. Besides the elevator issue I believe that a table should always be available to hotel guests and not sold out in advance to visitors staying elsewhere. After complaining in the Club Lounge a \u201clast table\u201d was found, to add insult to injury though the restaurant never exceeded 50% capacity in the three hours we dined there. Very Weird. Sadly despite me asking two people in the Club Lounge on three separate occasions \u2013 I trust that at least one of them gave my message to him, he never had the decency to find the time in the three days thereafter to contact me to discuss my concerns. Hotel management who believe they are bigger than their title have a lot to learn and it is truly disappointing that the manger of a hotel like the Ritz Carlton receives my biggest criticism. Shame on you Mark, especially in lieu of the genuine effort your staff are putting in to making this a great hotel. Despite this I would recommend staying at the Ritz Carlton, especially for guests looking for good service on special occasions in a truly spectacular location (height of building not area of building). The people and the service are what make this place special, in fairness had the room rate been HK$3500 or less the hotel would be perfect and my best in world. However I would not recommend the hotel for first time visitors looking for a central location wanting to explore the city.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing Experience at the Spa\u201d", "Author": "Bluelagoon771", "ReviewID": "UR106429875", "Content": "The newly established Ritz Carlton in Kowloon is located right next to the Kowloon station.

Most disappointingly, the spa.. all the therapists speaks good English which was impressive but overall the treatment was very basic. The experience and technique of the therapists were below average and my sore back felt even more sore after the therapy. I paid over 400 USD for a 100minute massage, and the therapy was very disappointing. At the same time, there seems to be no 'relaxation room' post therapy_ where many spas in Hong Kong and Kowloon such as Mandarin Oriental, Langham Hotel, Intercontinental, W Hotel, and Peninsula has. It's nice to be able to enjoy the sauna, jacuzzi, and relaxation room with a bit of tea after the treatment... Overall the experience was very disappointing.", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cSpectacular!\u201d", "Author": "AZJetSet", "ReviewID": "UR106293593", "Content": "My husband and I are no strangers to the luxury hotel market having stayed at some of the world's most iconic, luxury properties including the Four Seasons Firenze, Four Seasons Budapest, Park Hyatt Paris, Four Seasons Buenos Aires etc... Combine the greatness from all of our favorites and we still don't come close to the level of service that we experienced at the Ritz Carlton Hong Kong. What's more, the hotel had only been open for a week upon our arrival! We were celebrating our 14th Wedding Anniversary and received a complimentary upgrade to a Harbor View Room. I don't think from 109 floors up it is possible to have a bad view, but the harbor view was incredible - especially during the evening light show. The room was very large by city standards and everything was gleaming. The bathroom was gorgeous, decked in beautiful marble. It was spa-like with an enormous rain shower-head and separate, large soaking tub. We especially enjoyed the relaxing bath salts. However, we were a little let down by the bath products which seemed a bit generic (Whatever happened to the Bulgari products or some sort of signature scented soap? I know the hotel has wonderful signature scent flowing throughout the lobby - it would make for a nice bath amenity). We paid for an upgrade to the Club Level which gave us access to a magnificent lounge staffed by the most professional and personable concierges imaginable. We were consistently amazed by Kit and Judy. Nothing was too much to ask and honestly, they anticipated our needs before we knew what we wanted. From recommendations for restaurants and shopping to always remembering our drink preferences. We were astounded by their genuine hospitality every time we visited. We also have to mention Phoebe and Elisa who were also exceptional. I should also mention that the Club Level offers 24-7 food and beverages. There was a full breakfast offered each morning (eggs cooked to order) and other traditional offerings. Additionally, the lounge serves lunch, afternoon tea, evening hors d'oeuvres, desserts and late night snacks. Did I mention that the lounge is on the 116th floor with incredible views? We made good use of the swimming pool located on the 118th Floor as well as the jacuzzi. The views from the pool were extraordinary - but if you're not easily impressed there is always the LCD images above the pool to captivate you. The location of the hotel is also magnificent. It is located within the new ICC Tower which, at 118 Floors, is the tallest building in Hong Kong. The building sits atop of the Elements shopping mall which is filled with luxury shops and restaurants. More importantly, Kowloon Station is located at the mall with access to the Airport Express Train. We were able to check in for our flight right at the station - no baggage to haul on the train - we checked the bags and they arrived at our destination - couldn't have been easier! Hats off to the bellman who carted our luggage all the way down to the station for us! I cannot imagine that he was expected to do that - but he did so enthusiastically! Finally, every staff member went out of there way to make us feel welcome. From the simplest gesture of saying hello to offering to take our photos or remembering our preferences in the hotel restaurant. We couldn't have been happier with our stay and highly recommend.

Part of the reason we stayed there was to try the new \u201ctallest hotel in the world\u201d place, and let\u2019s be honest, as big as Hong Kong is, there are not a whole lot of choices. Let me start by saying that I\u2019m not a fan of hotels that are sandwiched inside tall office towers, I like a hotel where the lobby is on the first floor, and where you feel that you are in a hotel at all times. This hotel is in the HK\u2019s tallest building, at 118 floors, the hotel lobby is on the 103 floor, with guest rooms all the way up to the 118 (where the lounge is). You can enter the hotel from the 9th floor lobby, which isn\u2019t easy to find by car or taxi, or from inside the Elements mall, a few escalators, a lift or two, and you are on the 9th floor, then a turbo jet lift to the 103rd floor to check in. There\u2019s a miniscule lobby like space on the 9th floor, and virtually no lobby on the 103rd floor. The views as expected are amazing, but surprisingly the noise even at 110th floor where my room was, is still loud. The hotel has only been open for a few weeks, and the teething problems are there, but that\u2019s to be expected. As another reviewer said, there\u2019s either too many staff milling about, or none. But the congregation of staff at the lifts got on my nerves very quickly. Not sure why they need 3 or even more people directing traffic. The Ozone bar on the 118th floor seems to be a great draw, and the lines in the 9th floor lobby are very long, the bar itself is quite ordinary, and the sushi bar menu was very mediocre. And getting asked to show your room key every time you go in and out of the hotel by the security staff was a pain, and also annoying, I understand that they are trying to control the traffic in and out of the hotel, especially to the 118th floor, but I\u2019m sure there are better ways than what they are currently doing. The rooms are very standard, oddly shaped, in a long narrow corridor like design for a waiting/sitting area to separate it from the bedroom. The baths are out of this world, so are the beds (of course they are also very new). The lounge on the 116th is one of the best, well stocked, and great staff. Our biggest complaint in this hotel were the lifts, the card reader didn\u2019t work most of the times, and I had to have the keys exchanged multiple times daily. Not sure what the deal was, it was a running joke with other guests, on whose key might work. For the value, I would stay at the Peninsula or Mandarin (even though a bit older), there you feel like you are in a hotel, and all the kinks have been ironed out. Not a place I would go back to anytime soon.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood but needs a lot of work\u201d", "Author": "EllisdadLondon", "ReviewID": "UR105386406", "Content": "As a brand new hotel the RC HK is still finding its feet. On the plus side it has a great location, fantastic views and excellent facilities (the swimming pool, gym etc are second to none). However there clearly are staffing issues. On check in I was told i had been upgraded only to find i was given the room i had booked. There was a noise coming from the window so I had to wait an hour whilst two workmen came to try and fix it. Eventually i was given another room, at the same standard. Generally there either appear to be too many or too few staff depending on your needs. Coming out of the elevator at lobby level there were times when there would be up to six staff waiting to push you in the direction they wanted you to go in. It was hard to explore the hotel on your own without staff coming up to you and asking what you were doing. Several times the phone would go unanswered when calling 'service experience'. There is often an impersonal and generic feel the the experience. In the course of a four night stay I never saw the same staff twice and nobody ever knew my name. This meant that every time I entered the lobby I was challenged by a member of staff when I went to use the lift. I understand that for security they need to be aware of visitors but it became tiresome having to explain that I was a guest every time I entered. Breakfast finishes at 10.30 each day. Usually that means you have some leeway after to linger but not here - the cleaners start hoovering around the tables at 10.30 precisely. The bedrooms are very comfortable - faultless beds and bathrooms. But again there is a generic feel, and no indication that you are even in Asia let along Hong Kong. And soundproofing is a big issue - i could hear everything from the next door bedroom - voices, phones - everything. I would suggest that for a couple of nights on business this hotel would be fine, for leisure I would not recommend it.

I was very fortunate to enjoy the very first days of the NEW Ritz Carlton with my family. And what a place they picked to open their doors again. They relocated to a truly spectacular spot in Hong Kong; on the top floors of the new ICC building at Kowloon side. It is officially the highest Hotel in the word. Upon arrival we were welcomed in a stylish, luxurious lobby. If desired, we could have even gotten a nice cup of tea. We were guided to the elevators and 'lifted' by means of a single elevator-trip of 52 seconds to the 103rd floor. The lobby on the 103rd. floor is spacious and very nice. Check-in is on this floor. There are several restaurants. The famous Italian restaurant located in the old Ritz Carlton is re-situated next to the lobby. There is an open kitchen so one can see all the action. The food was (again) very pleasant. Besides this Italian restaurant Tosca, there is the Chinese restaurant Tin Lung Heen and a dining area specialised in dishes made off and with chocolate; The Chocolate Library. In the Lounge & Bar area an international menu is served all day long as well as breakfast. I loved the huge MEGA lamps! What a design. Materials used throughout the Hotel; lots of marble, leather and plush fabrics. Pleasant, relaxing, stylish and 'luxurious' colour schemes. The overall interior design & lighting is breathtaking. Very well done. The Ozone Rooftop Bar at the top floor is just spectacular when it\u2019s dark; Incredible decoration. It will be one of THE places to be in Hong Kong. Rooms: Well appointed and spacious. Bathroom (with TV) in cream coloured marble, flat screen TV (wall mounted) etc.etc. Colour scheme used: brownish, leather wall fabrics. The swimming pool on the 118th floor is just stunning; the view is superb but also the clever use of flat screen panels next to and above the whole pool is fabulous; blue skies, moving white clouds and the likes. Very well designed. It\u2019s the highest swimming pool in the world. But the best part of the Old Ritz has been moved to the NEW Ritz; the people and their genuine warmth and level of service. I always loved to stay in the Old Ritz Carlton and I was pleased to hear that a lot of the former employees have returned to the new Hotel. I will be a fan of this new place just as I was of the old one. Of course there were some small hiccups these first days but I am truly impressed. The Ozone Bar is from now on my most favourite spot in the world. And my kids felt themselves very welcomed as well. Thank you and congratulations with this new place. Just one question remains: will they place again this giant bouquet of Lilies back in the lobby\u2026..? I always LOVED the smell of it; it was iconic.", "Date": "April 3, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d2016610-Reviews-The_Ritz_Carlton_Hong_Kong-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "$575 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">International Commerce Centre, 1 Austin Road West</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">1 Austin Road West, Kowloon</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2016610", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/84/99/3a/the-ritz-carlton-hong.jpg"}}
