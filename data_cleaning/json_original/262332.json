The room itself was fairly good in size suitable for 2 people only, it had a King size bed that could be split into 2 king singles, only gripe i had is that the bed had no downer/duvet on the bed and just the sheets, but as it was very hot in January it didnt bother me. Room had tea and coffee,fridge,microwave,toaster no oven. Fully air conditioned highly recommended. There is a restaurant onsite that serve breakfast hot/cold or just cold express breakfast, room service is also available.Location: located 2 minute walk from the train station, 5 min walk to Chatswood Westfield shopping Mall (huge)", "Date": "Aug 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR130559337", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "samiez"}, {"Content": "Close to Transport I stayed in a one bedroom Apartment at this hotel for over a week and never had a problem with any of the facilities.

The staff were friendly  the location is excellent: a stone's throw from bus and train station. The only minor niggles were that the bathroom basin had no plug, there was no shelf for toiletries and 2 out of 4 bed-side light bulbs needed replacing.", "Date": "Dec 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR790178598", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "R0bert95"}, {"Content": "A convenient apartment hotel in Northern Sydney We were in Sydney for a combination business/leisure trip and selected the Saville Park for its location and features. The standard hotel room is somewhat small so it is worth the extra money for a 1-bedroom apartment -- well equipped with fridge, washer/dryer, etc. The front desk staff were quite helpful and friendly. The hotel is right across the street from the Chatswood train station and hence the easy access to rail and coach transport. (The station is a stop for the Wine Rover coach service to Hunter Valley.) Beyond the station on Victoria St. is a shopping/restaurant area -- we were told it is the second largest chinatown in the Sydney area. (We had a great meal at the BBQ King restaurant!) In a year or so there will be direct rail service from Chatswood to Macquarie University so Chatswood will be a very good place to stay for visitors to the university and/or the Macquarie business park.", "Date": "Apr 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR456115954", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "2TxTrvlrs"}, {"Content": "A great Aparthotel, Highly Recommended This was our 2nd time in 2 years at the 2 Bond Street, Crn George St. Saville Park Suites and yet again it truely delivered.We arrived on the Sunday 6th Feb 2005 and stayed for 6 nightsFrom the moment you arrive, you are greeted by enthusiastic, pleasant and helpful staff.There was 7 in our party and we had 2 - 1 bedroom apartments and one studio apartment.The apartments were all spacious, modern, well maintained and comfortable. All with the added bonus of washing machine, tumble dryer, dish washer, microwave and stove.The rooms are air conditioned and quiet, despite being in the centre of all the Sydney action.The pool area, although small is clean and considering your location (in the centre of the city) a great place to sun bath in the afternoons.You are located right in the heart of the city, surrounded by the office buildings. But don't let this put you off if you are holidaying as you are a 2 minute walk to the shops, bars, restaurants and cafes of the city centre and 4 minutes to Circular Quay, the opera house, the botanical gardens and most of the major tourist locations.There was absolutely no -ve points during our 6 days and we will definately use Saville Park Suites again.", "Date": "Feb 25, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR311908278", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d262332-r13278027-Mantra_Chatswood-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "262332", "Price": "$255"}}
