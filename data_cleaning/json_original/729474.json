They couldnt find my Expedia reservation and couldnt tell me whether they had taken a deposit. Breakfast is poor. The location is very good on Reforma. It was fairly cheap at 485 but I would have preferred to pay a bit more.

The Zocalo is nearby as well as Bellas Artes. The hotel is not fancy, but it will do. You have to ask for your towels (huh?). Breakfast is included. The room is reasonably clean.

The location is perfect, it is near to the market at Balderas near to the large sat. art fair and near enough to the belles Artes and the Zocalo. It is always nice to start the day off with a good breakfast and you do get one there.Continental is free and for a few dollars you can get a full Mexican breakfast.Yum!
