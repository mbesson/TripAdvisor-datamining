It was very clean and quite. It was close to bus stop and subway. We were a little bit confuse on which button to push to open the gate after a long day going around the city. Before checking in, you need to ask the receptionist which button to push to open the gate so you can come in. There is no curfew. And you can ask the receptionist a night before for a transportation to the airport. It's not free. Overall the place is very clean. I would stay again if I visit Rome.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cNice budget stay in western Rome\u201d", "Author": "Kristina H", "ReviewID": "UR119976583", "Content": "We looked for a hotel in western Rome and found Casa La Salle through other positive reviews on Trip Advisor. We found the catholic guest home near metro Cornelia (line A) to be a pleasant hotel with nice and efficient staff, situated in a lovely park. There was no noise from the busy traffic. Our room was basic, very clean and beds comfortable. Lift to second floor, easy access for wheelchairs to and inside the hotel but a small hill upwards from the park gate. Ample breakfast was served in the restaurant, a large room, somewhat noisy. There was Internet access in day room for e-mail but ban on Facebook and chat sites.

And they were right. It is an oasis of calm in a city where tourism is wall-to-wall, noisy and generally ill mannered. It is some distance from the centre, but there is a good metro service (station about 500m away, use the lift on the left as you walk up Circumvalazione Cornelia) and bus number 916 which gets you to Corso Vitorio Emanuele (passing St Peter's on the way). From Corso, the Fori, Colosseo and Laterano are easily reached, also Nabona and Pantheon (good restaurant Ponte e Parione in Via Santa Marina dell'Anima, just off Nabona). Casa La Salle is spotlessly clean. Reception staff all speak English and are very helpful. Breakfast is OK, much better than in many hotels in Rome. Evening meals are typical home cooking and good value for money. Parking is free. You also have access to the grounds, which are extensive and peaceful. The house also has safes, which at 1 Euro for the stay, is cheap. Parking is free. Debit, single beds, no TV, fixed shower which fails to maintain a constant flow of hot, so you sometimes get cold water. Internet access ia free and fast (unless the place is full and everyone else has the same idea). Nice to hear birds in the gardens, which are very well kept. Be careful with taxis. Those in St Peter's wanted 30 Euros. From Piazza del Risorgimento, about 400 m, 10 Euros. Also be careful with drivers from Termini. They wanted to do us for 5 Euros, which he \"thought\" he had given us in change. Yes, I would stay here again.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winona, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cSimple, great location, great breakfast, comfortable\u201d", "Author": "junebug619", "ReviewID": "UR100767899", "Content": "Because this hotel is run by the Christian Brothers, Casa La Salle is not the place to stay if you're looking for amazing luxury or incredible amenities. However, if all you want is a comfortable bed, a clean bathroom and a great location, Casa La Salle is a great choice for your trip. The nearest subway stop is less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel, the nearest grocery store is less than 2, and great food just around the corner. Be advised that there are no queen sized beds, or even double beds. Double rooms mean two single beds, so if you're looking to share a bed with someone, you'll be pretty cramped for space. That said, the beds are comfortable, and the staff keeps the (small) bathrooms clean. The complimentary breakfast is absolutely delicious-- fresh croissants and hot Italian espresso are just one part of it. I was there for a week and never got sick of eating the same thing every morning. If you'd like a little more variety in your breakfast food, I would recommend the Pasticceria (spelling?) just down the street on the corner-- I could have spent all of my money there. I highly recommend the hot cocoa! One thing that some members of our group liked was the mass offered in the attached chapel. Even if you aren't interested in the services, it's worth a look at the chapel for its beauty. All in all, Casa La Salle was perfect for the purpose of our trip-- simple, clean, and in a great location.", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "SURREY", "Title": "\u201cCOMFY BUT....\u201d", "Author": "CERI00335", "ReviewID": "UR64384860", "Content": "rooms are clean and tidy, with all amenities - the only drawback was the distance to the centre of rome - bus or metro ride needed really unless you like walking - which limited night time activities/restaurants", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cGood price, great room.\u201d", "Author": "Eubbie", "ReviewID": "UR59446024", "Content": "I travel to Rome twice yearly for business and always stay at Casa LaSalle. The hotel is owned located on the grounds of the Generalate of the Brothers of the Christian Schools. Better known as the Lasallian Brothers, it is a teaching order of men. The hotel was originally housing for members of the order. The rooms, while simple, are incredibly clean with private bathrooms. Each room has one or two single beds, a desk, a wardrobe and a bedside table. The rooms are air-conditioned, but I prefer to open the 6\u2019 windows and let the evening breeze cool the room. The beds are comfortable. Free internet service is available in the rooms and computer terminals are provided on the first floor for those who need them. Breakfast is included in the price of the room. It is the basic Italian offerings: meats, cheeses, fresh fruit (much of it grown on the grounds), juice, yogurt, breads, cereal, etc. While there is a coffee machine that makes cappuccino, espresso, caf\u00e9 Americano, etc., you can request freshly made cappuccino or espresso from the wait staff. The hotel restaurant serves lunch and dinner daily at a cost of 15 euros and is added to your hotel bill. You need to inform the hotel desk a couple of hours prior to service if you plan to eat at the restaurant. The meals are Chef\u2019s choice and typically three courses: an antipasto course, a pasta course and a meat and vegetable course. It\u2019s kind of hit or miss. Sometimes it\u2019s fabulous, sometimes it\u2019s so-so. The menu is posted at the front desk. The park around the facility is beautiful. The walking paths are newly resurfaced. There is a small museum that contains artifacts of the founder of the order. The Chapel is home to the relics of the Order\u2019s founder and several other Saints who were members of the order. Mass is held daily at 7:00 a.m. Casa La Salle is located in less a touristy part of the city. It\u2019s less than a block to a grocery store, a market is located across the street, and there are several inexpensive excellent restaurants within a couple of blocks. It\u2019s a quick two block walk to the metro and a seven minute ride to Vatican City. A cab stand is located about 2 \u00bd blocks away. They will pick you up at the hotel, but you will pay the cost of the trip from the cab stand to the front door. The hotel has a car service to Fumicino. The cost is a very reasonable 30 euros.", "Date": "March 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida", "Title": "\u201cA very nice place to stay in Rome\u201d", "Author": "LGS26", "ReviewID": "UR17289161", "Content": "We stayed at Casa La Salle on May 2008 for 4 nights. 2 at the beginning of our trip and 2 at the end.

It is in a gated facility (to my understanding it used to only be open to priests, etc.) and is across from a police training center. It was also in a good neighborhood and thus felt VERY safe. Rooms are spartan--two beds, a nightstand, desk, private bathroom with toilet, shower, and bidet, towels and soap included--but very clean. Breakfast is very basic but definitely enough to get you started. The staff was also great--we had a student get ill and they offered to contact a doctor and gave us an extra room for him to stay in alone without any additional charge. Students do stay here, so it was sometimes noisy but the staff does respond to complaints (we know because they thought the noise came from our kids!).
