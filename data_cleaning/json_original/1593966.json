Each unit is ocean front and has full floor to ceiling windows. There appeared to be mostly adults staying here. We felt very safe here, even walking through the grounds at night. The Mahana grounds are quiet, well maintained, clean and there is ample free parking space. They are re-doing the entry doors to each unit which will include windows to let more light in to the studio and one bedroom units (the two bedrooms are already bright). There is a grocery store right across the street. This particular unit is privately owned and offered for rent on two by-owner rental sites. We were three adults who stayed here for two wonderful weeks in September 2011. Jennifer, the owner, was very good to work with and alleviated my fears of renting via VRBO (especially because we booked nearly a year in advance). She always answered emails and addressed any problems or questions quickly and pleasantly. The condo was clean, well organized and had everything we could have asked for and more. I am very particular about cleanliness and this condo was VERY clean compared to some five star hotels we have visited. The kitchen was fully stocked with every utensil and cooking item we could have needed (not that I cooked on vacation). The quality of the finishes were top notch. The counter area has two chairs for a quick morning breakfast. The dining table between the counter seating area and living room has four chairs, so six can sit and eat comfortably. The rear bedroom (island view) was quiet and comfortable. It has a large walk-in shower and dressing area with sink and storage for personal items. Storage under the bench in the rear bedroom held extra sheets and blankets. The master bedroom held a comfy, CLEAN king sized bed and still left plenty of room for two large Asian inspired bedside tables. The built-ins had more than enough room for our clothes and personal items. The stacked washer/dryer unit is in the master bedroom behind full sized mirror doors. It doesn\u2019t hold much at once, but that is common for a stacked unit. The large walk-in shower is built for two. The separate shower and toilet area also has a cabinet for storage. Floor to ceiling windows provide breath taking views. The side window between the kitchen and dining area provides a full view of the pool area - from the grill area and main entry (on the left) to the ocean (on the right). The walls are a dark green but there is no lack of light in this condo. Well placed track/recessed lighting and natural light from the floor to ceiling windows give this condo a bright airy feel. On a side note . . . We did view a few other units (that were for sale) while we were there. The 301 unit was very clean, bright and updated in comparison to some others. The studio units seemed adequate for two people if you are only staying for a few days. To me it seems that after a few days I would feel cramped. The one bedroom units would be perfect for two people, but didn\u2019t have the views that the two bedroom units have. The separate bedroom made for a more home-like environment and afforded more closet room. Be sure to ask to see pictures of the bathrooms, some had shower/tub units that were not updated as nicely as unit 301. The only thing I would change about the Mahana would be to make the condo and grounds non-smoking (the actual unit was non-smoking). We would not hesitate to stay at the Mahana 301 again. Thank you to Jennifer for being a joy to rent from!", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cExellent Mahana unit 1104\u201d", "Author": "kittyboo2011", "ReviewID": "UR119648228", "Content": "After 3 month of research in TA, I decided Mahana unit #1104. I booked through Chase \u2018n Rainbows which customer service was very efficient and everything was done in 20 min. An advantage to book directly through owners is you get a room exactly what you want, and a disadvantage is when you arrive, even if you don\u2019t like the room with some reasons, you are stuck with it. I liked the fact that the owners had 3 other units in Mahana and if emergency, I could contact Chase \u2018n Rainbows which had a local office in Maui. The unit 1104 was exactly what shown in the pictures. It was very clean, high quality, tasty decoration and very comfortable. I am picky about a bed. The still new king size bed was not too hard and not too soft, very comfy bed. The kitchen had all the basic stuff you need, not for a heavy duty cooking but who wants to do in vacation in hot weather. I recommend checking in the room first and see what the unit has in the kitchen such as salt, paper, coffee, sugar, BBQ spices,\u2026 then go to a store. There were 6 beach chairs, 2 of which were high quality ones and we borrowed them every day to beaches. There were also 2 cooler boxes. The refrigerator had an ice maker, so we didn\u2019t\u2019 need to buy ice. When we went to Hana, we took both cooler boxes packed with a salad, bread, lunch ham and drinks we bought from Times and we had a nice lunch at Hana Beach Park. Someone posted about the building repair construction recently, but I didn\u2019t see any construction guys or didn\u2019t hear any noise even in daytime. Also many people posted that Internet connection was not so good in rooms, but I was surprised we didn\u2019t have any problem in our room. I think we had a modem in the room. The dual sinks in bathroom were large enough for two of us and were convenient to get ready in early morning. There was a plenty of bath towels and kitchen towels but not a hair dryer there. There were 2 elevators in each building, which were fast and never crowded. We used a pool and a hot tub, which were never crowded either. Tip: You can rent a beach towel through Chase \u2018n Rainbows $2/each. It is an oversized blue color and quality is good. We rented 4 and didn\u2019t need to pack our own in our luggage.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cReally nice.

For starts, this is the only one I've seen where the living room and bedroom both have a view of the water; normally the bedroom is tucked in the back, with poor ventilation and no view. The entire west side of the living room and most of the bedroom was floor-to-ceiling windows. The deck/patio was entirely private, with no views of other decks (or views into ours). Kitchen was very nicely stocked. Beds were comfortable, if soft. Great A/C for when it got muggy. The pool was quite pretty and big enough for general family waterplay, although perhaps not suitable for swimming laps; we saw quite a few people swimming off the beach. Beyond these things, there was a grocery store and a couple casual restaurants across the street, and Lahaina is only about 5 miles south, making the location much more convenient than Napili, for example. Great snorkeling is just a few miles north at Honolua Bay. We booked through Pleasant Hawaiian and were assigned a room by the front desk.

The condo complex is absolutely outstanding, I wish I could give it more than 5 stars. The staff is supurb, Karen at the front desk, Mark the manager and Susan the Expedia Guest Services representative. All went the extra mile to help us during our stay. The view is breathtaking and the grounds are very convenient to all activities on the island. The best new thing is the beach walk opened in 2010. You can go through the condo parking lot and walk 5 miles all the way to the Hyatt. Dukes a great restaurant is right next door. There are many beach facilities along the walkway if you want to stop and swim, walk, whatever. Great jog in the AM. There is no much to do on the island or you can do nothing. The units are updated yearly and my fav unit, 915, had many upgrades next year. I always rent from the condo itself, NOT VRBO, because of the personal assistance. The deposit is small and balance is not due until you check out. If you need anything, call the front desk and they are right there for you. Parking is free, there is a great grocery store across the street and a great pizza place in the same complex. You are about 15 minutes from Lahaina, a great place to shop on Front Street, restaurants, etc. If you go, you must try Kemo's and Ruth Chriss Steakhouse. They are wonderful. Had a great lunch at Cheeseburger in Paradise. This town reminds me a lot of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands. Overall, you will not go wrong with this location.
