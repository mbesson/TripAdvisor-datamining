{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good basic hotel This hotel was booked for a visit to the Christmas Market for a group of 10 people. The accommodation was basic but clean, the beds were rock hard. The breakfast was excellent and incredible value. The hotel was a 20 minute walk from the centre of Frankfurt so may not suit all. The S-bahn stop is about 10 minutes walk away and is a very effective and cheap way of getting around.What we did not know when booking the hotel was that there is a brothel next door. Cab drivers told us it was not a very nice area though none of our group were troubled in any way and the hotel was fully booked.", "Date": "Dec 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR678335905", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "CarolePC"}, {"Content": "Good basic hotel - good breakfast! My first impressions were not too good but perhaps it was a mistake on my part DO not assume that:-you will have a phone in your room-that it won't be next to the lift-have coffee/tee ketle-somebody reads your notes on booking from a websitePlease do call them and let them know about your particular requirements - I wanted a non-smoking double bed roomwhat did I get a stinking from smoke twin bed room.no phone,etcafter talking to the owner of the hotel he did his best to meet my requests although it was the busiest time of the season for them.I was very impressed with the breakfast choice - different 4types of cerials, yogurts, scrambled eggs or boiled eggs, fried bacon and german sosages, nice cucumber and tomato, and 4 types of break and some cheese and other type of ham...Location is central, with the view of the river ( again ask for this )the neighbourhood was quite strange - a bordel from one side of the street (no noise or disturbance at all) and The Frankfurter Management School and the building of SaatchiSaatchi...just 5 min walk to the tube/train station about 7 min walk to a supermarket...", "Date": "Nov 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR772368019", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "beachmadam"}, {"Content": "Disappointing! I had booked this hotel for 4 nights through hostelworld.com on 4th April 2008 ... I booked 3 months early since most hotels were already full or expensive to my budget, due to the Tendance Fair in July. I had found Hotel Central Frankfurt through Hostelworld.com which was quite affordable. A week after, when all I thought all was ok and settled, I sent an email to the hotel asking if all was booked and ok....just to make sure that they have received the booking. A certain Ko replied that they CANNOT ACCEPT the price!!! I was disappointed as nobody had contacted me about this first of all!! I could have ended up stranded in Frankfurt! The hotel asked me for TRIPLE the price I had booked it which was not affordable to me since I am a student. I replied back and I never heard from them again since then! I sent a dozen emails but nobody still is replying back!! They have not even given me half the deposit that they owe me after such a disappointment!! I contacted hostelworld, who were quite fast in reply, but they said all they could do was give me the other half of the deposit and an extra 10 euros as compensation if I book with them again! (which I will never ever do again!) . I expected them to arrange the situation with the hotel!! I thought hostelworld was a much more reliable booking engine as well! Though, I was explained that the incorrect price was the fault of the hotel since they upload the price! I have lost 2 hotel offers due to this as I thought all was ok! The Hotel Central Frankfurt service is absolutely a disgrace!!! No sense of customer care!! Beware when you book this hotel through a website (especially hostelworld) ! The price is still incorrect on hostelworld website at time of writing this review...two weeks after this incident (the double bed shared bathroom) ... Not a reliable hotel!!!", "Date": "Apr 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR308409935", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Gugu_85"}, {"Content": "A little on the skethcy side... Check-in: Run by an Asian family who spoke very little English, but they did try to be accommodating. No problems. Everything went fairly smooth.Lobby/Hallway: The Lobby was teeny. The hallways had their lights set on 10 second timers or something rediculous like that so 10 seconds after you hit the switch it would shut off. My wife and I had a room very near the door into the hallway, otherwise it could have been very frustrating. It was dark and dirty and we both thought it was pretty sketchy.Rooms: We not bad. Bed was very low to the ground and the room size was small, but whatever. Decor was ugly. Not dirty, just ugly. I don't think the room was made the whole three days we were there. The bathrooms looked good, though. So yeah. Also the river-side view was very nice, as long as you don't look to the left and see the half-nude woman made of neon.Area: Right next to us was an Eros Centre or, as we liked to call it, brothel. It is reasonable, from where we were located, to walk to most of the big spots, like the Romer, the Cathedral of St. Batholomew, and the Opera house, or even right into downtown. There is also a train station very nearby. But as far as food goes... there is an over-priced petrol station about 5 minutes away, but any real food is at least a 10 minute walk. The hotel is also on the river and fairly close to a couple Main River dinner cruise companies.Amenities: They had a continental breakfast which was plentiful and delicious. Something my wife and I enjoyed every morning we were there. Other than that there was really none to speak of.", "Date": "Mar 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR708884925", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Pastor_of_Muppets"}, {"Content": "A terrible hotel This hotel is a disaster. Dirty, noisy, right next to an adult bookstore.I checked out after one night even though I had reserved it for 3 nights. They charged me for all three and lied to me that Expedia would be the only one to reverse any charges. The rooms may have been remodled but it reeks of being an hourly hotel. The bathroom was not slimy, the few of the lights worked and is next to an abandoned manufacturing plant.Don't stay at this hotel, keep looking.", "Date": "Oct 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR551383740", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "ubzw"}, {"Content": "ATTENZIONE! non \u732b disponibile...   showReview(22794521, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR611907705", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "L' albergo \u732b molto...   showReview(20715126, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR478667108", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Hotel im Erotik Zentrum   showReview(20088240, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR451710831", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Barbaraella300"}, {"Content": "Sehr gutes Preis/Leistungverh\u76f2ltnis,gerne wieder   showReview(17440864, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR889545614", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Naja   showReview(17440863, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR476322701", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "eine sehr sch\u679ane Nacht   showReview(15072489, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR398130184", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Ice-Angel"}, {"Content": "Preis/Leistungsm\u76f2\u813dig nicht zu schlagen   showReview(14736862, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR475313884", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Hotel Central   showReview(13201263, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR630909770", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "g\u7709nstiges Preis-/Leistungsverh\u76f2ltnis   showReview(11662112, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR978523428", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Sehr gutes Preis-Leistungsverh\u76f2ltnis inkl.
