We were not expecting a great hotel based on the hotel rating and reviews we read on Trip Advisor, however, we were still disappointed with what we got. Our biggest issue was that the hotel advertised as having air-conditioning, and although it may have an air-conditioning system installed, it had not yet been turned on for the year when we arrived. The temperatures were mid-twenties in Venice during our stay, and being on the 4th floor of a small, poorly ventilated hotel, with very very tiny rooms, it was well above thirty degrees in our rooms, which made sleepy impossible. We complained to the front desk about this and the only response we got was \"the boss hasn't turned it on yet\". We advised the staff that the hotel advertised as having air-conditioning, with no mention of it being operational only seasonally, however, the staff did not seem at all concerned with our complaints. The \"boss\" was not contacted about the complaint. The breakfast at the hotel was also quite disappointing. It consisted of canned pears and prunes, yogurt, bread rolls, and one cereal option. This would not have been so bad if they kept replenishing the supply of those items, however, often the yogurt tray was empty and the canned fruit was all gone and it would take a very long time for them to get refilled, if they did at all. The only good thing about this hotel is the location near the Rialto Bridge (but still quite difficult to find).

But that wasn't so bad. The worst part was the bed: the matresses were hard, as in broken, there were loose springs in different places and it hurt all over our bodies. Very uncomfortable beds, so we didn't sleep very well. They offered us to change rooms but said the matresses were the same in all rooms. We also had a problem with the heating, which made a horrible, loud noise, and it was fixed by the third night. The bathroom was fine, recently renovated and big. The only problem was the lack of shower curtain (there was a tub), but it was ok because the shower didn't wet too much the floor. - Internet: free wifi on the room - Breakfast: the breakfast room is small, but going early we managed to find a table. The breakfast itself was fine. - Staffl: the best part of this hotel is the staff: very helpful and nice men, always with a smile, willing to solve any problem or to help with city questions.

We had arrived by train and then took the vaporetto to the Rialto stop. It was a fairly short walk to the hotel through the campo San Bartolomeo. There were signs posted to help find the hotel. It is located down an alley off the campo. This was a wonderful location to set out from on our exploration of Venice. The front desk staff was wonderful. The front desk clerks were very helpful and friendly. There is no elevator. The hotel was very quiet and well kept. I had brought a north american extension cord for my CPAP machine in case, the electrical outlet was far from the bed, but found that I did not need it. I had a converter for the plug already. I then gave the cord to the front desk staff advising them that they might have a north american guest sometime in the future who many need it. They accepted it graciously. The room on the 3rd floor, ( north american fourth floor)was small but clean and tidy. We had reqeusted two single beds and they provided them. The bathroom was equipped with a bidet and a hairdryer along with a sink, toilet and corner shower stall. I am not a large person but found the shower stall very small. If you dropped the soap and bent over to pick it up, your back would lean against the handle of the water supply and shut off the water. However I found this to be the case in the hotel in Florence we had just come from. The wardrope was large enough for two people and it had a wall safe. There was no refrigerator. There was a wall mounted television with many channels but none in English. The windows opened on to a small court where the residents of the surrounding buildings hung their laundry. You felt you were really living in the neighbourhood. Breakfast was included and consisted of cereal, fruit cocktail, various breads with cheese, butter and jam. Also baked sweet rools and yogurt were provided. To drink there was tea, coffee and two types of fruit juice. The breakfast was enough to keep you going until lunch. As Venice can be quite expensive we found this hotel to be fairly priced and comfortable. The neighbourhood was full of shopping opportunities, wine and cheese shops as well as the many choices of stalls on the Rialto bridge and over to the far side of the grand canal. There were many restaurants as well and many had a tourist menu offering 3 courses for a set price. Although we had bought a 3 day unlimited pass for the vaporetti and used it all the time, Venice I found was quite small and you could walk to almost anywhere you wanted. The pass was a very good value. We also took the vaporetto to the Lido and to the island of Murano. The vaporetti are quick, efficient and comfortable.

We stayed on the second floor, and the only noise was from people coming down the stairs to breakfast in the morning.

The reviewer that found the \"calle\" or alley the hotel is down to be a bit frightening is not exaggerating! However, once you go down it, you realise there are lots of people around, and at night there is a bar and a restaurant open, so it is not at all dangerous at all. It is just the way Venice is designed, and once you are used to the narrow calles, it is so charming and delightful to go down them and see what lies ahead. A note to people driving to Venice: When you park in the covered lot and get out of your car, there may be men directing you to the boats to Venice. Ask them what the fare is, and if it is 10 Euros, start looking for the signs for the water buses! These guys are directing you to water taxis, which do not give you a choice as to where you get off! Furthermore, the places they stop at are diificult to disembark, we had to jump across a yawning gap and they threw our luggage after us! The water bus on the other hand, is cheap and they have a tourist pass that can be used as many times as you want. The water bus goes right from the parking lot to San Marco square, or the Rialto bridge, or anywhere else. It also gives you a lovely tour of the Grand Canal along the way.
