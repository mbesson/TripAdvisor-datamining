View was half of the Holiday Inn next door and partial of the harbor and bay. It was rather noisy from street traffic and the airport just down the road (although very convenient to the airport). We like to stay near the airport when we have early morning departures so we had to excuse the jet noise. The coffeemaker was single cup and not good for a couple of people..so we had to split the first cup...and morning java is important to us while dressing. The WIFI which is advertised free is non-existant on the 6th floor and is a weak WIFI system overall. They do have a computer in the lobby and we had to go downstairs to use our laptop. Balcony had no chairs. BRIGHT lights on either side so that you had no privacy. We had room darkening drapes but the bright light came around the edges making the room quite light at night. The breakfast is typical economy hotel --no juice, coffee, cereals, waffles, better quality pastries, yogurt, bananas and apples. Negative was the small windowless, no atmosphere breakfast room. They really should do something about that. Room price was about $80 + tax. We had 2 queens but the room was smaller so not a lot of extra space. Also, room amenities were a fridge and microwave. Parking was free and there seemed to be plenty of it. I would not stay there again because there are so many other choices of equal value.

In our case on the sixth floor, the slats could not be closed properly, resulting in a chimney-like draft in the hallways. All rooms have a small balcony, and the seal on the door in our room was as as airtight as a burst balloon. While examining it, the upper third of the rubber seal fell down, the rest of it being very porous and just plain old (everything looked to be original from the day it was built). The amount of air passing through the door caused the curtains to move and would have sufficed to put out a candle. We had requested a non-smoking room, and when checking in I asked for a quiet room. This was on the sixth floor and I was puzzled that a non-smoking room would have an ash tray (another person in TripAdvisor commented this is the smoking floor, which then should not have been offered to us). We soon found out that smokers can use the balcony to smoke. The road in front of the hotel has expansion joints every twenty feet or so, and cars driving by give off a tuc-tuc-tuc sound all night (reminiscent of cobblestone roads in Germany). So we have a room that has a door that has effectively no seal, meaning we could hear each car going by all night long. The chimney effect in the hallways sucked air in through the balcony door, causing the heater to go on and off all night (we found no way of turning it off), plus the smoke from the room next door came in, turning our non-smoking room into a smoking room. We complained about the seal and maintenance was sent up. In keeping with everything else - they simply confirmed the door opened and closed properly. Nothing about the seal. We were offered a different room on the same floor, but standing in front of the balcony door we experienced the same draft as in our room, so we simply stayed put. I even considered buying some foam window seal at Wal-Mart to fix it, but decided the room wasn\u2019t worth the 5 bucks. As others have pointed out, breakfast is a disaster. Seating for 36 people. I counted 59 cars in the parking garage. You do the math, especially since many vehicles will have 2 or more passengers. Going into the breakfast room and hoping to find a seat requires a real optimist (or a fool). We drove around the corner to Dennys one day, and then grabbed some doughnuts at Winchell\u2019s (also just around the corner) the next day. The beds were OK and the room was clean, so no minus points there. The rooms have apparently been renovated in part (wallpaper, carpet), but the balcony doors look to be original equipment from when the hotel was built. The faucet handle on the vanity also looked to be original equipment (one of these handles you pull and pretty well limits you to all on or all off). The TV was an old Zenith picture-tube type. No telling how old it was. We checked out Saturday morning and Sunday morning we discovered my wife hat forgotten her keys. We called the hotel and somebody went up and retrieved the keys. Since we were planning to be in another BW hotel until Wednesday, I asked if they could be mailed using the post office guaranteed overnight service. I was given a number of reasons for not even trying something like that, rather than trying to find a constructive solution. Our confidence in the staff competence was somewhere down around the level of whale excrement in the ocean, and had no confidence whatsoever that the staff would be able to mail the keys to us anywhere, so we drove from Las Vegas to LAX via to San Diego to get the keys. Given that maybe only 2-3 people handled the key ring, it was pretty cheeky that one of them stole a small xenon flashlight from it. For a simple overnight, the hotel serves its purpose. We were not paying Hilton prices, so we did not expect Hilton service. On the other hand, I do expect a bit more than Motel 6. During our 10-day vacation we stayed in five BW hotels, and this was the absolute loser. We will never return - there are plenty of other hotels in the area for the same price that I would consider first.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cTerrible (non) sound proofed patio door!\u201d", "Author": "GabbaGabba", "ReviewID": "UR123781341", "Content": "Our family stayed here in January of 2012. We chose to stay here on the last night of our holiday so that we'd be close to the airport, car rental drop off and be able to use their laundry room facilities. Our check in went smoothly. We unloaded our suitcases and unfortunately on the way into the hotel from the parking area, there are about 8 stairs to climb before you enter the hotel lobby. Argh... We went to our room and got settled. It was clean, the bathroom was nice and bright and the sink area was separate and also well lit. The room was a fair size. Not big but not small either. The fridge and microwave were a good size and were spotless. One wall of our room was glass and had sliding doors out to the patio that looked out over some houses behind the hotel (run down dumps with garbage all over their property and one with a barking dog), it also looked out over the parking lot next door, Harbor Drive, the harbor and some restaurants across the street. Once we were settled in our room, I thought I'd get the laundry done and then we'd all head across the street to grab dinner before going to sleep. Problem 1:The laundry room was hard to find. It isn't shown on the hotel's map located in the \"welcome binder\" that you find in the room. All is said was that there was a laundry on the 2nd floor. I got off the elevator and sure enough I turned the wrong way. No biggie. When I finally did get to the room, I discovered, after putting coins in the washers, that the machine that sells soap was out. I went to the front desk and asked if they had some or if maintenance could refill the machine so I could get my laundry done. Nope. I was told that they had only one box (I needed two) and that the machines were not the hotel's. They belonged to some other company. The woman on the front desk then told me that I'd have to walk two blocks to buy laundry soap at a store if I wanted to do my laundry. Needless to say, I went back to my room, grabbed the car keys and headed off to find a grocery store. Not a very happy camper at this point. Once I got back and completed our laundry, I gave the jug of laundry soap to the woman at the front desk to offer to anyone else needing soap. She just looked at me and said \"oh\". It was at this point that my husband had a brain storm: why wouldn't the woman have offered you some of the hotel's soap? They have a laundry room where they wash the linens so they'd have soap to share since the laundry is supposed to be a hotel \"amenity\". Argh! Once the laundry was done, we got some food from a restaurant (Italian. Can't remember the name but it was awesome) and then settled in for sleep. Problem number 2: The restaurants across the street are handy so you don't have to drive to grab a meal but at night. Once you're parked you can just walk. But, here's the issue, there was all kinds of noise from patrons leaving them throughout the evening. I thought I had left the sliding glass doors open but had not. There was no sound proofing at all. It was terrible. We had an early morning flight and I was woken up at least once an hour, up until about 3 am. Not happy. Problem 3: The thermostat was out of order too. It was so hot in our room that the only way we could cool the room down was to turn on the air conditioner. We tried to turn off the unit but it wouldn't let us. Argh. Didn't stop for complimentary breakfast. It looked good but we wanted to get to the airport. I did use the computer to catch up on some emails. That was nice to have. Our check out was smooth. And our bill was what we were quoted. The location is great, the pool area looked nice (didn't use) If I didn't have to do laundry and the rooms were sound proofed from the outside noise (no inside hotel noise!), then we'd consider staying here again.

This wasn't a big deal for us, though, as we were rarely in our room except for at night. I also requested a room on the side of the hotel due to previous travelers comments about the road noise from North Harbor Drive. This statement I found to be very true. I consider myself a pretty heavy sleeper and the noise even woke me up! It is rather shocking how loud that road is being that we weren't even facing the street. That said, the hotel is very small and it apears that almost every room is within earshot of North Harbor so I don't think that can be helped. I also found that the walls in this hotel were extremely thin because we heard our neighbor's alarm clock, as well as their crying baby almost every morning. We could also hear people's conversations in the hallway, no matter what time of day it was.

I am also not a lazy, dirty slob. I am above average in neatness, an admitted exercise & health nut and feel I have reasonable expectations. Hopefully that helps you understand where I am coming from as you read this review. First of all - the customer service and friendliness of staff at this hotel is outstanding. Adriana, at the front desk was pleasant, helpful and happy to see us. She got us two rooms together even though it wasn't easy and she did it quickly. The rooms are small (a king bed dominates the room) but the clean and comfortable. The room has a desk, chair, fridge, microwave, tv - the usual things you'd expect. The bed had LOTS of pillows and the mattress was the most comfortable I have ever slept on in a hotel. The room looked out over a parking lot (as most do - your other view option is the street near the harbor) but I could care less. I had no intention of sitting on my deck in SAN DIEGO anyway - who stays in their room in SD!? The shower actually has heavy flow (unlike most hotels where you have to dance around in the shower to get wet) and a tub deep enough to soak in if you want to. My only drawback to the room would be somewhat small, no view, and need another outlet near the computer desk, but those are minor things. The pool is small but clean and a spa is available too. The workout room has a treadmill, bike, eliptical machine, towels, and inflated rubber ball and a weight machine. A bit warm in there, so if you like to sweat, you'll love it. And get there early - your card opens the door anytime and hotel staff do not enforce the hours. Breakfast is GREAT. Waffles, pastries, toast, fruit, yogurt, peanut butter, jam, hard boiled eggs, coffee, juices, tea...etc. You gotta love American style continental! Everything tastes good, but it gets crowded so go before 8 if you can. There are apples and sometimes even home baked chocolate chip cookies in the lobby during the day. Yes, there is traffic noise in the rooms since you are on a main street. If you need a \"sound soother\" (a small machine that emits \"white noise\") at night just ask. I called from my room for one and had it in less than 15 minutes. They're free and work great to drown out the traffic noise for those of you who find that a drawback to being at a centrally located hotel. Parking is free and this hotel is near EVERYTHING - literally less than 15 minutes away are the following - downtown SD, Old Town SD, the Zoo, Point Loma, all the military bases, the Midway Battleship, etc. Airport is 5 minutes away and there is a free shuttle. Carlsbad is 30 minutes away and Mission Bay is 20 minutes away and both are worth the drive. I had only one issue at the hotel - my shower knob fell off for some reason and it was replaced and fixed in less than 10 minutes. The maintenance guy apologized and was very pleasant. So, to sum it up - super friendly staff & great customer service, free parking, good breakfast, centrally located, clean & comfy.

We had room 211. The location of the hotel is across the street from the harbor which is delightful. The amenities are OK. Great pizza & other food items across the street. Actually it was the ABSOLUTELY BEST PIZZA I have every had! Another cozy harbor restaurant farther south which had decent food for a reasonable price and then another strictly fish restaurant even farther south on the harbor which had some fantastic fish dishes. More expensive though. There are another couple of restaurants nearby as well. There is a convenience store within 2 blocks, bus within 2 blocks and fast food within 2 blocks. Liquor store too! Area is safe and generally quiet except for the main streets which are busy. Breakfast is served from 6-9 or 10? It includes toast, bagels, pastries, fruit, yoghurt, waffles, boiled eggs, coffe, tea, juice, milk, cereals. I liked the architecture of the hotel best plus it was spotless. The least thing I liked was the elevator noise. It doesn't keep you awake at night, but if you are in the room it is always present. It is really too far from Tijuana if you have to go many times, as we did for dental work. It takes about 1.5 - 2 hours each way which is just too long for us. Didn't swim in the pool, but the hot tub was really appreciated as San Diego was not that warm. All in all we had a very pleasant stay and all the staff we had any dealings with were competant, courteous, and helpful. I'd definitely stay again if I had business in that area.

Some of the rooms are pretty small, and with two queen beds there isn't much in the way of spaciousness. We knew this going in, and sure enough, we found ourselves in one of the smaller rooms.

Two bikes would have been a little tough. I picked up the phone and asked the front desk if they had a larger room available. The answer was a simple YES. I immediately went down and exchanged our keys, and we moved to a larger room even though it had the same two queen beds. Painless. We would have survived comfortably in the smaller room, but this was definitely better. It didn't cost us anything to get the larger room. In addition, the staff was very friendly and helpful.

You can't beat the location-about 5 minutes from the airport, 5 minutes from Ocean Beach and Sunset Cliffs and 2 minutes from the Harbor. No airplane noise, which was great! Plenty of conveniences nearby just a few streets over: Post office, grocery, starbucks, fast food of all sorts, shops, gas stations, great restaurants and cheap eats too! The beds felt brand new as did the bedding. Clean bathroom and carpeting, comfortable chairs and spacious. We liked that the toilet and shower were closed from the vanity area so we could both get ready and not have to stand in a sauna if one was showering. We'd stayed at the Sheraton on Harbor Island once before and the rooms were extremely small so this was nice to have room to move about in. We used the chairs as our suitcase stands and never bumped into anything. The room had a large closet nook with a good iron and ironing board as well as a very good sized fridge (even had a freezer drawer) and microwave. We visited the heated (but not too hot) pool which was nice with a good number of chaises and chairs, as well as umbrella tables for 4. The parking was also very convenient and the best part--free! There is a parking garage that hoops around the back of the hotel that you can get in/out of from either driveway. There is a small front driveway for check-in marked Fire Lane, but we saw people dropping off/picking up so it's ok to park there for a few minutes. The front was the only ramp accessible entrance to the lobby we saw. Though not an issue for us, but could be for some--from the parking garage there is about a 10 step staircase to get to the lobby. We paid about $10 extra per night to have the Harbor view and it was beautiful. There is one little problem with being on the harbor side--the street noise from Harbor Drive. I think because of the curvature of the building, the noise is captured from the street, so if you have a harbor view, you may awake to sounds of cars. It's not that there's a lot of traffic--the Point Loma area is great because it's not really traffick-y but even one car going about 45 is oddly loud. Could be the material used for the road, but just a warning. The negatives for our stay were minor. The towels were in good shape but weren't really thick like some other hotels, the vanity lighting was not as bright as I'd like but there was also lighting near the full length mirror as well. We would have liked suitcase stands (I'm not one for unpacking into the drawers) and an in-room safe, but we had no trouble with the staff, so I guess we didn't need it--we're just used to having them. The hotel breakfast room seemed about the size of a hotel room so it was Definitely not large enough for more than about 12 guests to sit. We had cereal and juice once, but decided to walk one block up on Harbor Drive to eat at Winchell's donuts most mornings (fabulous donuts by the way!).

The only complaint I have is for some of the guests who were greedy pigs, stuffing their bags with 4 or 5 bananas and taking ridiculous amounts of food to their rooms. There's always going to be some of those wherever you go. Very convenient location next to the marina where I enjoyed an early morning stroll and watched the fishermen coming in with their catch.

I like to check out hotels for my clients and I figured this one might be good because they shuttle to and from the airport and the cruise ship terminal in San Diego. After staying here for 2 nights, I don't think I would recommend it. First off... when we drove up to the hotel, there is no front drop off parking. It looks like there is an area for it, but there is a sign that says No parking / Fire lane. So we had to drive around to the side of the building and bring our luggage to the lobby. As you drive up you kinda look at the place and wonder why it looks like an apartment. We were apprehensive right from the start. Second... when we checked in the guys didn't seem very organized and couldn't handle more than 1 person checking in. Someone butt in front of me and nobody said anything. Then when we got our room, we took our luggage and wandered to our room. As we were walking there I mentioned to my husband about being on the first floor and that it would seem they are putting us in the bad room because we got such a good rate... boy was I right. Our room was just barely bigger than a Manhatten hotel room. We couldn't even fit the luggage cart into the room. They also gave us a room facing the construction. We figured that is where we had to stay because we got a good rate. Once I turned on my laptop and found out the internet wasn't working there, we went back to the desk and told them to get that fixed. At this point a lady was at the desk and she seemed much more effecient. She found us another room, that was way bigger and the internet worked. So we took it. Third issue... I think truly this is an old apartment because the sound travels everywhere. The patio door to the outside seems to be very thing and you can whisper outside at the street and you can hear it in the room. It was horrible. I don't think the door closed properly, but even so, the sound was horrible. We got woken up one morning at 1am and had to phone down to customer service to inform them that a bunch of guys where in the pool smoking pot and partying. Since the pool is just around the corner from the lobby, I don't understand why they didn't hear it. The ladies who were at the front desk where great and always helpful. The cleaning staff was good and the continental breakfast was better than I had expected (considering the hotel). I don't even think for the price (travel agent rate), I would stay there again. It was way to noisy and the fact that they gave us that horrible room in the first place, was a bad first impression. I won't be recommending it to my clients. If you are forewarned about this place, then it is ok. Everything was clean and it was so nice and close to everything. Maybe if they did some updates to the rooms and made it look a little more like a hotel and not an apartment, it would be ok.", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Rafael, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, fantastic value\u201d", "Author": "runbkswm", "ReviewID": "UR53492022", "Content": "I don't get some of the other reviews on this site.

First the good: the place looks nice. The reviewer who said the decor looks dated must have stayed in a different hotel because all of the decor in the rooms and public spaces was contemporary and new. It is obvious that the hotel was recently renovated. Rooms have microwaves and fridges. The location is good if you're going to the airport or harbor. There are many seafood restaurants in the area, and we ate at Pomodoro twice, which is an Italian restaurant staffed by actual Italians. Now the bad: -When I checked in the rate they tried to give me was higher than the confirmed AAA rate that I got from bestwestern.com. When I showed them my printed confirmation they fixed it. In looking at other reviews it appears I'm not the only person they tried to overcharge. -The wireless Internet didn't work for the entire weekend. I talked to the front desk a few times and called BW's Internet tech support twice. I'm an IT guy and, according to tech support, the access points needed to be restarted but the front desk said no one in the hotel knew how to do it. All they knew how to do was reset the router, which wasn't the problem. I offered to help and they said no. So the only Internet access was a sole PC near the lobby. -The hot and cold in the shower were switched and one of my friends said hers was also switched. Either the pipes are backwards or, more likely, the handle was put on upside down. One morning I took a shower at 8:00 and the hot water was almost gone. (The previous night when I washed my hands the water was almost scaling so there is hot water sometimes.) -Another friend traveling with me said she came back to her room at 10:00 pm and it hadn't been made up. -The rooms are indeed small. My king room had about 2 feet clearance on one side and 3 feet on the other, and bout 3 feet at the foot of the bed. --Each room has a balcony and a nice view but there's no furniture out there. -There is a lot of outside traffic noise at this hotel--not the hotel's fault, it's just in a noisy location. I heard no noise from the neighbors; it was all from the outside. So if you are sensitive to noise bring earplugs.

We booked this hotel based on the price (as my retired grandmother and mother-in-law are on tight budgets) and it's proximity to all the attractions we wanted to see. I was amazed at just how close it was to the airport without feeling like we were on the runway as well as just how close it was to all amenities (10 minutes to Sea World, 5 minutes to the Zoo, many restaurants and a grocery store within minutes). The rooms are basic but clean, the bathrooms look like they've recently been renovated, and quite sound-proof (my parents were in the room beside us and couldn't hear the kids at all). The rooms do seem like they are a touch on the small side, we felt a little cramped with 3 suitcases in there but not to the point of being annoying. There was a mini-fridge and a microwave in the room which was fantastic for us with small children. My only minor complaints was that the \"continental breakfast\" was quite minimal and by our 5th day the breads/muffins/etc were stale and there was only a couple of bruised apples and under ripe oranges for fruit. The other was when we checked in there was a discrepency over the price - I had booked via the 1-800 number and was quoted an AAA rate of $89/night. However when I checked in they told me I was wrong and the rate they had was $99/night. Fortunately for me I had my printed e-mail confirmation and once I showed this to the front desk agent she immediately corrected it, but I wonder what would have happened had I not had that.
