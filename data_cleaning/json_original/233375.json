The reception staff don\u00b4t roll out the red carpet for you, but neither are they rude. They happily gave us all the informatin we needed, and this was the only hotel on our trip that allowed us to check in and access the room before the usual 2 or 3pm for which we were very grateful. We parked with no problem in the parking under the hotel which was free of charge. Our room on the 5th floor had wonderful views over the local countryside, was extremely quiet and, OK, it had no shower curtain but it\u00b4s quite easy to shower without getting everything wet and the room had everything we needed and was spotlessly clean. To get into the centre of Rome you need to walk to the bus stop (3 mins) then take a bus to Laurentine metro stop (10 mins) then take the metro which can take you directly to the colosseum for example (15 mins). OK, you don\u00b4t have ancient Rome on your doorstep, but at the same time, you have a wonderful quiet night\u00b4s sleep, peaceful views over local countryside, a 15 min car/taxi ride to Ciampino airport (for which I was grateful when catching a 6:30am flight) and a price which reflects this. These days we all pay different prices for a hotel room, depending who we booked it through etc etc. so I can\u00b4t comment on what others paid, but for the price we paid for our room, excluding breakfast, we could have stayed at the Aran Pak for 4 nights for the the same price as one night in a city centre average hotel. It\u00a8s all down to personal priorities and I really don\u00b4t mind half an hour of public transport and a quiet hotel if it means I still get to enjoy all the sights of Rome as anyone else.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jeddah, Saudi Arabia", "Title": "\u201cSo Far to Be Good\u201d", "Author": "Mohammed_Reda", "ReviewID": "UR126509562", "Content": "Aran Park Hotel is located in a quiet suburb of Rome away from the city centre and the main attractions.

On our first night, we had car service take us from FCO airport to the hotel. It took the driver some time to find it as it really is in a secluded, but nice area. Nice lobby and dining area. Staff pretty indifferent, maybe even rude, took some time to find our reservation even if we were under Trafalgar. I think it's because our last name was misspelled. I asked for two keys and the one guy kinda shouted, \"One key!\" Ok, I guess my husband and I can survive with one key for two nights. Got to our room, and despite the negative reviews.. the room was actually nice and clean BUT it smelled terrible, like an old man who smoked was just there. We opened the sliding door and let the room air out. Nice cool breeze accompanied with what sounded like a karoake bar or club singing nearby... complete with a dog howling! We actually enjoyed the entertainment. Otherwise, it's a very quiet neighborhood and very private with trees surrounding the hotel and balconies that are separated by glass dividers. We went down for dinner and we just assumed it was buffet only. Looked delicious, but was terrible. 25euros. The hostess wanted us to pay cash and didn't seem to understand the concept of charging to our room. After dinner, we had to walk with her to the front desk to clear that up, and it seemed like the guy had to explain the concept to her. Hmmm.. kinda weird for a place that is FULL of tour groups, with this kind of lack of knowledge and zero English (which is forgiveable). But it seems like this is how it is at this hotel. Walk up to the front desk and everyone seems to avoid you and no one really acknowledges you and then they all have to look at each other if you make a simple request. Did I say the food was terrible AND overpriced? Our stay was pleasant enough, with breakfast being pretty good, the room/bath clean even if stinky and the a/c worked during a couple of really hot days in Rome. The tour director admitted that even they often don't get the help they need to run the tour smoothly at this hotel compared to others on our itinerary, and attributed it to the fact that this hotel has LOTS of tour groups come through it. But you would think they should be appreciative of the business and at the very least pretend to be in the SERVICE industry. C'mon, 5-6 people behind the front desk and no one knows anything or wants to check on what you need? Okay, fine. We're tourists and we're crowding your beautiful city while wandering around with our cameras around our necks. Anyhow, that first stay would have earned a 3 out of 5 on the rating scale.. but my stay included one more night, which was our last night of our tour. Fine, we understand that the elevators are slow and that the luggage doesn't get delivered as fast here as the other hotels so we are willing to carry our own bags off the bus so we can change for dinner. Yay, that our hotel keys are ready for our rooms and it's okay that our TD was the one who had to yell out our names so we can retrieve them quickly (unlike our hotel in Venice whose front desk guy passed them out cordially) and it's okay that I was assigned the very last room in the longest hall.. but what was NOT okay was.. that this room seemed to be UNDER construction still, will plaster chips here and there, the carpet barely vaccuumed of the dust created by the repair done to the air ducts, which had no use since the a/c DID NOT work at all during this hot day. Unlike our first stay, the bathroom was filthy and moldy, and the room was seriously dusty, as if it had been abandoned for a while. I wonder if I could've breathed in some asbestos. It's like these rooms were opened up last minute to fit us in, evident by the hallway dust that only seemed to start at the last few doors. It's like these rooms were roped off or covered with plastic, only to be torn down when they found themselves short of rooms. I might have been correct because we later learned that the Roman police had booked up the hotel to full capacity because of the pending protests that evening. The only reason I didn't change my room was because I knew it would probably be like a root canal and that I had to get ready for dinner and i had an early morning flight and figured we'd be there for only a few hours. Plus, it would've taken me at least 15 minutes to get to the front desk. It was so filthy. I couldn't wait to leave. Oh, and the tv was unplugged which was more evidence that this room was closed off for repairs. Plugged it in and it finally worked when we fiddled with it. Btw, you can never ring the front desk from the rooms.. I guess when you're part of a tour and your room is prepaid, you can't ask for anything unless you take the trek downstairs ,only to find no one really wants to help you. I'm not the type to complain about trivial things (like only 3 channels on tv or no mints on my pillow), esp. when they are part of the culture but these are basics that a customer should be entitled to when checking into a hotel: cleanliness and service (even if cold.) Tour companies really should be diligent about checking the hotels that they use for their paying customers. I didn't give this hotel the lowest score because the first stay I had was good. BTW, the second room was at the end of the hotel where they demolished what used to be a parking structure. I'm not sure how much more dust that would have kicked into the room while the sliding door was open. I agree with a previous review that the staff seems DISorganized and is in dire need of training, especially if they will be dealing with many tour groups at once.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burnie, Australia", "Title": "\u201cHotel nice, staff disorganised and disinterested\u201d", "Author": "Archer_011", "ReviewID": "UR119341672", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel on a Trafalgar tour.

(American visitors should note that Italy is in Europe, where it is not customary to have things like coffe machines and microwave ovens in hotel rooms - that's what apparthotels are for...) .

This is the only reason I haven't recommended this hotel for mature couples and families with children, amd only provided they don't have a car available. On the other hand a hotel in the centre with the same level of comfort would cost so much more that the price difference would cover the costs of a rental car for the stay, even if one travels alone.

The only good thing about the hotel is they have a big balcony in the room, that's all.

The building obviously is in need of a bit of sprucing up to make it what it could be--- a comfortable place to stay away from Rome's hustle & bustle.

There was absoultely nowhere to leave toiletries in the bathroom as there was just a sink , no countertop nor shelf, & the mirror was about to fall off the wall. In the room itself, there was no cabinet, therefore nowhere to rest one's bags except on the floor. There was 1 chair in what should've been a double room.

The room was like a room should be, with a cabinet & counter top, plus there was a place in the bathroom for toiletries. Unfortunately there was no shower curtain therefore the floor got wet.

Fortunately in the true double room there were 2 chairs, so we enjoyed late evenings or nights sitting on the balcony enjoying the cool, fresh air.
