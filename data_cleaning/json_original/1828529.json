A good 3 stars with a nice breakfast buffet and a wonderful terrace for the smokers (the rooms are non-smoking). Great bathroom, very clean and in perfect functioning conditions. We were lucky to have a room with the window giving to the inner court so we had natural light but not the noise of the street. The hotel is located at 5 min from the crossing of Avenida Diagonal and Avenue Balmes and at 15 min from Paseing de Gracia, where Casa Mila and Casa Battlo are located. We choose the hotel because the theme of our visit was Gaudi, and wanted to be as near as possible to his many creations around the city. We thought we would be able to walk arround to each of them, but we did not foresee that Barcelona is such a big city and walking would take too much of our restricted time. So, with the much appreciated help from the hotel staff (Gloria, we thank you so much for all your good advices!) we start using the marvellous public transportation. The buses 17 and 24 are running on Balmeo down to Paseig de Gracia to the core of Barcelona: Plaza Catalunya. Bus 19 is running from Plaza Catalunya to Sagrada Familia. Metro (subway) line L5 links Diagonal station (15 min from the hotel on Av. Diagonal to the east) to Sagrada Familia and from the same station you can take L3 down to Plaza Catalunya. The bus 24 is also going from the cross-roads Gran de Gracia/ Traverserra de Gracia directely to Park Guell. Aside the Gaudi sites, we went to visit Barri Gothic section (nice cathedral and good shopping) and the port and the beach side, where one can have good seafood restaurants and pleasant atmosphere. Gloria instructed us to get the City Bus Tour and we did, and we recommend that anybody take this tour first thing on arrival: not only it helps to orientation but you get discounts to different museums and visiting sites. Around the hotel area there are many restaurants and coffee shops. Gloria sent us to Moncho's, a buffet style restaurant opened from 10am to 11pm and serving Spanish tapas. We also went (and what a pleasant surprise) to La Flauta II (on Balmes south of Av. Diagonal); take care to go there either before 1pm or after 6pm because there is a long waiting line for table seats. Coffees are great everywhere and ice creams and sweets divine. Only one restaurant we will avoid: the Trobador on Eric Granados south of Av. Diagonal: in spite of the wonderful terrace, the staff chited us blind on both the order and the bill. What we would recommend to improve the quality of the hotel? If the management would consider covering the corridors with wall to wall carpet this would increase the quietness of the place by blocking high-heals, children feet and language rollers noises to get into the rooms during the wee hours in the morning!", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfax, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cits ok but hallways are so loud ... you can hear everyone..\u201d", "Author": "maritez", "ReviewID": "UR96429295", "Content": "Every space counts, golf course in the rooftop.. its ok..

Room we stayed in was of medium size, included desk, TV, minibar, chair, wardrobe and shelving and two large beds pushed together to make a double.

Breakfast was very good continental style buffet - eat as much as you like, regularly topped up - same food available at 7.30 as at 11.00. Definitely recommended. Back to location - it looks a bit out of the way but is only 800m from Diagonal metro and, much better, lots of bus links close by, e.g. 14 and 17 to get down to the Ramblas, Barri Gotic, harbour etc. (and back), 16 to Montjuic, 32 to the Estacio Sants plus others to Parc Guell etc. only about 1000m to the Passeig de Gracia and the Modenist buildings.

The street and area is pleasant and safe with pavement cafes, bars and restaurants in the immediate vicinity . It is next door to a very good supermarket for basics, toiletries, alcohol, food, snacks or anything you may have forgotten. Avenue Diagonal runs parallel a stone's throw away for a taste of sophisticated retail therapy and a pleasant tree lined walk; and buses are very close by for a short ride across town or into the centre for La Rambla and Placa de Catalunya. For a short break - buy a T10 pass for 10 rides for both bus and metro with a 3month expiry date. Cost is about 7 Euros. Much cheaper than taxis! Hotel reception staff are very helpful if you need to know how to get around and are on duty 24/7. The hotel is clean, modern and has an intimate feel to it.

The friendly English speaking reception staff were helpful and the hotel is well maintained. Our adequately sized room faced the road but this was quiet at night and the walls seemed to be well sound-proofed so we were not disturbed by noise from adjoining rooms. The cold buffet breakfast was good with the opporunity to eat on the terrace in fine weather. We often used the Diagonal Metro station at the top end of the Passieg de Gracia which is 10 minutes walk from the hotel. This gave us cheap & quick access to anywhere in the city. The Gaudi sites of La Padrera & Casa Batllo are near this statiion and there are fine shops, restaurants & bars along the Passieg de Gracia . We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who would like to stay in the quieter, more upmarket Gracia area.", "Date": "September 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, England", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Palmier", "ReviewID": "UR5528024", "Content": "I thought this hotel was lovely.
