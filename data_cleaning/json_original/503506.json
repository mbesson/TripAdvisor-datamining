It's a good place to stay if you don't want to be in the middle of the \"tourist\" areas but still close enough that you can get easily about. Two tram lines intersect here - #26 which goes straight to the central train station (3 stops) and #10 which follows a semi-circle around the downtown area hitting most of the major attractions. Several restaurants and pubs in the immediate vicinity with good menus. These aren't tourist places (but they still spoke fluent english) - just good old normal local hangouts. Jamie Oliver's Fifteen is just a 10 minute walk along the water (towards the train station) if you want to try out something a little more upscale. As others have noted there is a medium sized grocery store right across the street which is perfect for buying snacks and drinks. There is a liquor store just down the street as well. I stayed in a 3 star room which was rougly half the cost of a standard room from the hotel chains located more centrally in Amsterdam. And while there was some obvious differences in standard differences (a small, old TV, some of the furniture was a bit worn, etc.) this hotel more than makes up for it in charm. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom was well stocked and clean and the room I had was extremely large. I had a room facing the water and had windows on two sides, which I can recommend. A friend who was staying at the hotel at the same time was on the other side of the hotel (facing the tram) and while the room was just as nice it didn't have much of a view. He was also disturbed a bit by the trams at night (which I didn't hear on my side of the hotel). I was there on a weekend and there is a disco across the street which can be heard well into the evening. I'm not particularly bothered by noises so I had no problem sleeping, but I imagine that if you are sensitive to exterior noise it might be a problem. The hotel itself is an interesting building with an equally interesting history - so don't be afraid to walk around and explore! The staff is great, very helpful. If you are going to the museums (van gogh or rijks) buy your ticket at the hotel and skip the lines (which even in the off-season are long!).", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlottesville, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cAdjust Expectations and You'll Enjoy\u201d", "Author": "Unwilted", "ReviewID": "UR128002260", "Content": "We had a great time at the Lloyd Hotel. The key here is to know what you're getting into. If it is not for you, you'll be unhappy. If you know what to expect, you'll be very satisfied. Others have explained the concept. Different stars all in the same hotel. You'll see people who look like they belong in a hostel checking in right next to people wearing business suits. Those who pay for the lower-star rooms will probably be satisfied -- as long as they are essentially expecting a hostel or a low-end hotel (even though creative and clean). Those who pay a lot for a five star room (we did) could be unsatisfied because this is not some fancy place with full service. It is an experience -- you'll get a crazy room. Great for somebody who has seen it all and needs something new. All that said, I'd stay at the Lloyd again but I wouldn't spring for one of the four or five star rooms. We paid for a five star room. It was crazy, it was cool. But if I were to pay that money again, I'd probably rather have the comforts and service that comes from a more typical hotel. However, I'd jump at the chance to stay here in a two or three-star room. The location is great -- away from the craziness but easy to the center of town and there is a grocery store and a few other things right there (tip: tram can get expensive quickly -- either commit to a multi-day pass or rent a bike).

Depends on what you call romantic of course.

Design, \"archi\" freaks en trendspotters might like it the way it is. People looking for something completely different as well. The 0 to 5 star principle is rather limited to your choice of room, not of service or food quality (teh same for all guests). As such I picked right in the middle with a 3 star room. The bed was great, the room large and the bathroom cold and very basic with towels that you would rather expect in chinese bunk hotels. But altogether I felt like paying the correct price, no surprise in either sense of the word. I wouldn't hesitate to ask the reception to see multiple rooms as they all differ even within the same price category. The restaurant area is nice with high ceilings, but again, it misses some charm to feel comfy and at home (if that is the experience you are looking for). Breakfast buffet is overpriced, better grab a coffee and croissant and go into town for a real brunch. During weekdays the (new red and rather small) bar is mainly visited by business people staying overnight with their colleagues after some meetings/brainstorms in the building. Staff at the 'reception' was welcoming and charming, the lady at the restaurant rather rude in her answer on a simple and polite request for scrambled eggs: 'absolutely not possible and that it is not her responsibility to take care of some, talk to the management if you don't like it'... Finally the hotel is not centrally located but with tram 60 just in front you are within 10 minutes at the central station so it shouldn't stop you from picking out the Lloyd as your exploring base.

You have to read about the Lloyd (I'm sure they have a website) to get the full picture -- in short, it has been both a hotel and a prison in the past! It was brilliantly redone a few years ago. The center of the building is lots of open space with a beautiful restaurant at the ground level and various places to hang out (kind of like lofts, floating above the restaurant) on higher levels. The hotel rooms vary greatly in decor and price (they try to provide options for all budgets) and the building is also a cultural center. You can enjoy free internet/computer use and there are games for kids and books and newspapers to read... There is a great vibe. The hotel was buzzing with activity when we were there but very quiet for sleeping. It's an unusual (special) place and we are very glad that we had the chance to stay there. It's probably an easy bike or tram ride into central Amsterdam but I don't know that I would want to base myself there if I had a whole week, say. There are two supermarkets, a couple of banks, and two bakeries across the street from the hotel but not much in the way of restaurants, it seemed.

I'd certainly not recommend it if you are bringing your loved one for a romantic break. I would recommend it, if you are into modern art and design and love \"interesting\" history of buildings etc. I'd also recommend it if you love to be offended, insulted, ignored and mistreated by hotel staff. You will be then pleasantly surprised by the range of bodylanguage, face pulling and tones of voice, rolling eyes, tutting, or staff raising your voice at you. Sadly, customer service is where this hotel badly let us down. Pretty much all staff need a good intensive course in customer service. Be careful as on arrival you might miss the smallest reception area in the world - something resembling a shower cubicle, painted yellow from the outside, paint peeling off in places. But I guess you won't really miss it, there will be a good few clients stood queueing and being insulted by the reception staff already, not knowing where to stand or sit as the reception area is in a narrow corridor, exactly at the spot where you should also be accessing the hotel's restaurant. The girl who checked us in rolled her eyes, and scowled in a really abrupt and bold way at the other customers while I was waiting. It just made me wish I never came to Amsterdam. First finding my, and other customers' names' on the reservation list... is my name spelled with a K? \"yes K for cat\"? Erm well not quite... \"NO IT IS NOT YOUR FIRST NAME I WANT. LAST ONE!!\" and \"Jeeesus, I am doing it NOW!!\". I was shocked. Really shocked. I understand this is probably the world's first hotel to offer a range of 1 to 5 star rooms. Good on you, interesting! Sadly, the service you will get will be the same regardless of which room or how much money you pay, or how you therefore expect to be treated. We were a \"right pain in the a*ss\" cos we asked other questions.. as I politely explained I was writing about the hotel for a newspaper so I expected a press pack to be waiting for me. After a search and being told there wasn't one, this repeated 3 times, but I insisted, as I really needed this, so in the end the stressed girl walked off and came back with a press pack about the hotel (in Dutch!?), which needed exchanging later, underdstably for one in English. The girl was trying to sort out request of another two customers as well as a group cheking out... My patience and understanding wasnt however appreciated, when I asked if I should wait, or perhaps come back later, she snapped at me. I am serious, snapped. Sadly, I also wanted to ask about an iron and ironing board, as we were due to go out shortly to a restaurant where we had a meal booked. She snapped at me again, because I asked if she knew how long it might take. It is such a shame that I was simply left feeling like every single thing was trouble, anything I asked, or perhaps would like to ask. Nobody tells you anything about the hotel, its service, Cultural Embassy, which the hotel is known for, or even where to get your breakfast. So off I went into our room. Apparently a \"4 star exceptional room\", this must refer to the design I guess in some strange waym, or perhaps just the size of the room. Despite being a couple, we had two single beds, so soft I did my neck in while sleeping two out of the three nights. Luckily, our bathroom wasn't in a middle of the room unlike some of other customers, but slightly separate, in a kind of half circle alcove without a door. Pretty spacious, and so was rest of the room. So those were the good points. The funkiest green-red-white flower deisgn carpet I've ever seen and the white whooden blind shutters on inside must have been the main feature. It also had the smallest TV I have ever seen (not sure if this is also somehow part of the 4 star design), but we weren't interested in TV, so whatever, really. It just made we wish the TV simply just wasn't there. I guess something must have happened to the original bigger one, which explains the spare TV remote control I found under my bed. Interesting lamps, beside tables and one white painted wooden chair - this must be some of the design specimens that are scattered throughout the hotel, its rooms and corridors. We weren't that keen on those funky wooden window shutters by the time the light came through them come early morning - there were no curtains to block out the light. Our ironing board and iron turned up soon, that must be the 1 star one, as the cover was detached and slid up and down, and iron churned out strange dry white crystals. Better than nothing, I guess. Getting ready was difficult as the only mirror was the small one in the bathroom above the sink. So we took turns to jump up and down in front of it to check out our outfits. (At least we had a laugh, I guess) Breakfast area is a huge tall ceiling bright room with a range of seating from comfy sofas to a communal bar style canteen type. Food offered was far from a good range, but enough to set you up for the day. (just because there is yoghurt one day, doesn't mean you should expect it the next day). You were also \"stalked\" by an \"Ann Robinson lookalike\" who kept frowning over her glasses, checking out and following customers and slipping them little pieces of paper to fill out, to establish who they were and if they were indeed entitled to their morning food. No good morning, no smile, no welcome. One gentleman stood over the empty tray of cheese and dared to ask, so \"Ms Robinson\" brought out another, but surely, she really didn't have to comment this by loudly calling over his shoulder \"More cheese! just in case you haven't got enough!\". So despite originally planning to speak to the manager about a possible tour of the hotel (to help me when writing the article), I resorted to avoiding any unnecessary contact with staff, after the rudeness experienced on the first night. I guess it shouldn't have been a surprise when returning to the hotel at night we walked into the bar/restaurant area for a drink and asked the waiter if it was open, only to be given a bold, blank faced, answer: \"FOR??\". \"A drink, please?\"... Yes we can? Phew.... thank you... Room service .... A lady walked in on us one morning without as much as a knock on the door. Nevermind. Next morning she must have decided we didn't need our soap and shampoo topping up because we still had some pieces of the tiny soap left over from yesterday. We still managed to use some of it before it melted into non-existence. The toilet could clearly wait to be cleaned til the week after. Nevermind. Enough of that though, I feel really tight now for stating the negatives. But I do feel the service was terrible. So on to the good points - the hotel has a fascinating history, it used to ba a way station for migrants leaving Europe, as well as young offenders instute, a prison etc.... with all of this incorporating into this design, and interior. Many of the original elements, parts or layout have been therefore preserved and reused, despite sometimes lacking in functionality. This hotel is to be marvelled at almost like at a design museum, so we did make sure to go for a walk around its corridors and staircase with photographic exhibition of the ongoing work. It is unique, apparently no one of the 117 rooms (or so) is the same, each different. One has a grand piano, and a bed that sleeps eight... It is fascinating to look at, but a little harder to enjoy as a guest. I wish the management would reconsidered the tiny reception area, and some staff training. The treatment of the customers I witnesses, just is not acceptable. Since we have been back, the management have apologised to us and sounded pretty shocked and surprised to hear what the experience we have had. They said they take the issue seriously and will be looking into it. I am glad, because the unusual and unique place this hotel is, if only a few people made us feel a little welcome, smiled and controlled themselves from snapping and raising their voice at customers, we could have had an unforgettable experience - in a positive way...", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAn awful hotel\u201d", "Author": "Looker097", "ReviewID": "UR110473254", "Content": "NEVER STAY HERE over priced!!

The hotel has a truly unusual character and it grows on you, especially if, like me, you prefer chain hotels like the Radisson etc. This hotel is nothing like it, yet has a charm all of its own. In-house dinner can be expensive but worth the cost.

I had mentioned to the woman booking the room for us that I would prefer space or a view - both of which we ended up having. Quirky layout but manageable, a peg to hang a coat or a flat surface or drawer to put things besides the desk would have made things easier but for 3 nights no big issue, then again this was the room we were in.

Grocery store & organic shop just down the street, not even 3 minutes walk. GREAT restaurant across the bridge - de Wereldbol - went for a walk and saw it, read the menu & a woman outside having a smoke told us it was \"the best\" and she was right.

Because finding hotel rooms let alone reasonably priced ones, is almost impossible in Amsterdam, so prices are painfully sky high and standards shabbily low. The pictures on the booking site (we used hotels.com) were deceptive. The price was 150 euros for a room, and the place was advertised as 3 star. However on arrival we were directed to a gloomy destroyed former hospital room, with broken tiles, hospital beds and dirt everywhere. it was depressing, and after being moved to a room without broken tiles near a noisy corridor, we decided that this must be a Dutch sort of joke,; to see how we would react or something. The reception was staffed by dis-interested student part timer types, who really didn't get it that people were paying good money for this hole, On further investigation we discovered that the hotel provides 1 to 5 star rooms in the hotel, thus giving itself an average 3 star status. This is misleading, and in any case does not work, as the reception area was like entering the front of a run down school; 1 star. Apparently the spooky building was a former reform institution, and they had taken great steps to try to preserve this character. It just isn't comfortable when you pay good money, and it certainly isn't a hotel. The shower in the room was in the room, and was a shower head and the floor with a drain hole and a flimsy shower curtain; like you get in hospitals. The place proclaims itself as a \"cultural embassy\" as well as a hotel. So what you get is a place full of posing and intense \"artists\" with the emphasis on scruffy and loud. In the morning, the new room to which we were sent, was filled with the noise of this \"work\" with people running in and out, having coffee at the table just outside the room door. It seems that the Dutch will try to sell anything by giving it a mis-leading title, When complaints are made, they give you that Dutch charm, which on further investigation is a grimace that hides the fact they cannot be bothered with you. After all, it's money for old rope in Amsterdam, where you could open a cardboard box as a hotel and make money in your sleep from tourists who need a place to stay. What was most bizarre about this place was the freaky notices left on walls like \"Go up the lift to the 3rd floor and you will see a door going up a stairs. What is behind the door?\". This plus a corridor full of empty baby cots and dirt, dirt, dirt everywhere was I suppose to give the impression of artists at work or the avant-garde. If you just need somewhere to rest as a hotel, then this place is the worst place imaginable. If you want to lap up the artistic atmosphere and not book in, then you can use their library or restaurant, but the trip from the centre will take you a good 45 minutes on foot, or you could try one of Amsterdam's expensive taxis.", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cQuite A Different Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Jnjtiger", "ReviewID": "UR95659076", "Content": "Novel hotel built into a former hotel from Lloyd Steamship Line.

We were allocated room 608 on the top floor and were taken aback on opening the door to see grafittied on the wall ahead of us \"contaminated\"! Must be \"art\" thought us and proceeded into the room. It was long and narrow with the functional space arranged along the higher part of the room in boxed off areas under the beamed roof. The bed was an organic upholstered shape that extended out of its boxed area into the main part of the room. This was definitely quirky and would have been appealing were it not upholstered in green nylon fabric. There was more graffiti on the far wall (behind a hammock) stating \"bed monsters\" and by now we thought the grafitti was less art and more a warning from a prior guest. What little freestanding furniture there was, was mismatched, old and rickety, of the sort you might expect to find in a junk shop. No desk, chair, wardrobe, it was a space more akin to an artists studio than a hotel bedroom. Reception were surprised at our request to move but moved us to room 124. This room could have been in a completely different hotel. It was huge, light and bright with a conventional bed and attractive furniture. The quirkiness of this room we were able to cope with - statement lighting and a view onto the lounge and restaurant below. The bathroom, was a prefabricated fibreglass unit that wasn't attractive to look at but was entirely functional. We had snacks and drinks in the restaurant which we enjoyed, especially the locally brewed \"end of year\" beer, and the staff were helpful and friendly. We also ate in the Cantine restaurant just round the corner from the hotel and would heartily recommend the chicken sate in this establishment. In short, the Lloyd appears to be a bit hit or miss depending on your room allocation.

Unfortunately, the prison atmosphere is still maintained in the quality of both the rooms and the staff. We have never come across such an insulting attitude of an impertinent, non-intelligent staff, as we experienced in this hotel. We were given a \"five star room\". The room was on the third floor, facing a noisy street. It contained a bed and a huge (for at least 10 prisoners) unnecessary cupboard. It's only use was to serve as a shield to the water coming from the wall-free, \"surprising shower\" (from the web..). We had to mop the floor each time we took a shower. There were no dark curtains. In fact, no certains at all, just \"stuck\" shutters which did not block the sun light at 5 a.m. In fact, it was impossible to sleep also before sunrise, due to the unbearable heat in the room. The temperature that day (3-4 July) was around 35 degrees. Not only the \"5 star room\" was not airconditioned, it was impossible to open the windows for providing the guests an opprtunity to get some fresh air. To my surprise, in the morning, when we told the man in charge about the terrible night we had, he did not express any sympathy. Moreover, he told the spoiled guests that he himself does not have aircondition at home. He explained that it's impossible to open the window for safety reasons \"Do you want us to be responsible for the life of guests who smoke and jump?....It is the same in Hilton!\". He just ignored the fact that Hilton is fully airconditioned.... The \"pleasant\" conversation, , with additional two staff members, continued. At the moment when they accused me of lying concerning a promise I was given on my arrival, I decided to leave. I took our luggage (my husband was already \"sleeping\" in the conference) and left. In this \"5 star hotel\" there is no one to help with the luggage. I was angry and tired and the result was that I fell of the stairs in front the hotel.

If you are not on your own or with a very close and loving partner ask for a room where the bathroom an toilet are sectioned off (in many rooms the toilet and shower a simply smack bang in the room just like any other stick of furniture). 2. Try to avoid the rooms where you walk in straight to the bathroom (we had to make up codes for 'don't come in I'm on the toilet, showering etc.' and the floor was always wet and messy...). 3. The rooms on the 6th floor are the funkiest but if you are tall you may want to avoid them because they are in the rafters. 4. It is worth paying the extra fee for reserving exactly the room you want because some of the rooms can be a surprise you would rather avoid. 5. If the hotel isn't fully booked we have always been able to shop around for a room that suited us best. 6. It is located on the outskirts but this new area is very cool and there are many nice places to hang out (check out the Odessa boat restaurant just on the bank in front of the main entrance, they are not always open and reservations are needed phone: +31204193010).

On at least one occasion when my daughter asked for coffee she was told, \"I'm really busy right now. You'll have to come back later.\" And it doesn't seem to be the fault of too few waiters, just incompetence and indifference.

No shower curtain, just a low curb around the shower with the shower head pointed straight down very close to the faucets with no ability to move it. They provided a squeegee for stray shower water, but no drain to push it into! And you couldn't get the water back into the shower for the low curb! When we check in they had folded a hand towel over the sink and lowered the stopper and left the faucet dripping. The towel was sopping wet. Only a curtain between the bathroom and the bedroom which consisted of two beds and one table and two chairs (and the tiniest TV we'd seen in Europe - although we don't go to Europe to watch TV). We had to put one of the chairs in between the beds for a make-shift nightstand. There were four lights with magnetic bases stuck on a magnetic strip that went around the wall about five feet high.

Many of the original details are still there. It has a great breakfast, a nice restaurant and an outdoor terrace. There are several restaurants and bars nearby. The area around the hotel is a mix of old and new, but mostly new and a little non-descript.. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a few metres away from a long dock on the Ij river (not just a canal) that gives a nautical feel to the place. And of course the building itself has a nautical history. Across the road there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shopping complex with a supermarket and ATM. You can take a tram to get into town. There is an underground car park right behind the building. The exit is metres away from the hotel. I was personally intrigued by the history of the building: I mean it was built by a shipping company as an emigrant hotel. It became a Nazi prison for resistance fighters. And then a regular prison. And then it became an artists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 colony. And now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a design hotel. Go figure. I think I was in one of the two-star or three-star rooms. My bathroom was hidden behind a wall, which I could swing open to divide the suite into two rooms. There was no shower stall per se. The shower floor was wood. Yes, wood, with grates. I had tiny plastic chairs. The lamps were hanging on heavy pendulums hanging from the ceiling. At one point in the hall there were chairs tucked into an alcove one metre high! I mean, it WAS interesting. Different. Having stayed at Lloyd Hotel, I now know there are hotels that, well, defy a TripAdvisor-style rating system. The rating system on TA is already not that simple. A one-star hotel can get a 5/5, and a five-star hotel can get a 1/5. But how do you rate a hotel with one-star rooms and five-star rooms? How do you rate a hotel in which every room is apparently different? I mean, this is not the Ramada. How do you rate a hotel where you often find yourself thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153now why did they do it that way?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153how does that work?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The LH reminded me a little of the scene in Absolutely Fabulous where Edina and Patsy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c3\u00bcber-trendy friends had an all-white d\u00c3\u00a9cor. Chic, but not always the most practical or comfortable arrangement. The LH is a very, very European hotel with the message \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we are cooler than you are\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and where the designers apparently felt they had a mission to challenge hotel guests. Design magazines and design books are strewn around the hotel, as if this were something that everyone did. If you're a traditional sort of person, you may not like this hotel. I can see why this hotel might have confused some guests and resulted in them giving it low ratings. To many of us, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153design hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd means \u00e2\u20ac\u0153expensive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153modern comfort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153luxury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Well, think again. I thought a few aspects of the hotel were distinctly hostel-like. The communal same-sex washrooms, for example (just for some of the guests). The tatty psychidelic throws. I sort of liked this aspect. It's a distinctly Dutch thing to do. My reaction to this hotel is based partly on the fact that I was here only one night on business. If I had stayed here for a longer period and paid for the room myself, perhaps I wouldn't see it the same way. The conference room was uncomfortable in hot weather (a rarety in Amsterdam). No air conditioning. The room however was comfortable, mostly because I had a great breeze. It was fun and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad I stayed there.

This time I was in a \"1 star\" room with a shared bathroom, and I have to say I did not enjoy the hotel this time. A few things: a) the room itself was extremely bland, to the point of being ugly - there comes a point where minimalism and the \"cool\" just turn into unattractive and shabby; b) the shared bathroom concept is just poorly executed here. OK I accept not all rooms can have private bathrooms - fine. But if we are forced to share, at least make the experience as comfortable as possible. This isn't a hostel (or is it?) so guests should be entitled to some degree of privacy, even in a shared setting. First of all there are no male/female washrooms - just one for everybody. Secondly there is no separation between the showers and the sink area. It would be easy to put a locking door on each shower cubicle so you have an area to get dressed, towel off, etc without trying to do so in a wet shower stall or a public room. Finally the condition of the showers were absolutely deplorable. They just appear dirty and run down, and the shower nozzle itself looks like it is from the 60's. Generally the staff/management of this hotel seem to have decided on their own version of what is \"cool\", even when in another setting it could be described as cheap and lazy. I also had to comment on the TV channels in the rooms. I know you don't come to Amsterdam to watch TV, but after a long day I like to pop it on to fall asleep to. There is one channel on the TV that plays a video over and over again which is all about airport disasters, hijackings, plane crashes, etc. There is graphic footage of planes crashing to the tune of \"Do the Hustle\". Personally I am blown away by how idiotic and insensitive it is to play this video in a tourist hotel. Why the hell would you play a plane crash video in a place where you know that 95% of people go straight to Schiphol Airport when leaving?

Because this place was a former prison, I somehow felt totally creeped out by it. Further, my room was horrible. I booked the 4star (or whatever the rating is) room expecting something better. The room had linoleum flooring which was beaten up, the toilet was standing out in the open in the middle of the three small separate rooms (I presume three separate cells). The two sofas were completely ragged. The shower had mildew. The windows were beaten up. The only thing somewhat OK was the bed but not even that was anything more than standard. I also found the reception extremely unhelpful. The people were fairly rude and seemed bothered when I asked for them to call a taxi for example.

Our room looked a little like the set of an Eli Roth film. Walls and floors were covered with institutional tile, chipped and broken in places with discolored grout between. About 6 feet up, the wall was plaster as was the ceiling. Tile and plaster were separated by a wide metal strip with numerous electrical outlets. Light was provided by a series of individual work lamps clamped on to the metal strip. Beds were small twins with comfortable mattresses. The entire wing we were on seemed to follow the same plan with the institutional origins of the building clearly showing through. The 5th floor seemed a little better with rooms based on what appeared to be a series of administrative offices, smaller than ours but a little more attractive (not a difficult feat). The primary remodeling seemed to have been done on the large public areas in the center of the hotel starting with a very good restaurant and extending up by stairway through a series of lounge areas including one with an enormous set of art books. Decoration was spare and minimalist but quite attractive. The best aspect was a pair of working elevators quite sturdy with some rather eccentric elevator music. There are a flight of stone steps to the main entrance but signs indicated some other access for the handicapped. Shared bathrooms were coed which may concern the more awkwark or prudish. The hotel staff were variable but seemed anxious to help. A wakeup call came on time and the taxi we requested also arrived on time. When we asked to change rooms because of cigarette smoke, they responded quickly. They provided any information we requested and looked up online what they did not know. The tramline stops for trams 26 and 10 (adjacent but at different levels) were just in back of the hotel about half a block distant. Tram tickets were available for sale at the desk. It is possible to walk into downtown Amsterdam but takes about an hour depending on how quickly you move. The area is primarily residential with a small strip mall across the street including a grocery store, liquor store, and bank. The area seemed quite safe to walk around at night and the residential blocks seemed upscale. Hotel clientele seemed to vary but many were from overseas and many were young. The hotel restaurant was popular and crowded when we were there and deservedly so. Overall, I liked many aspects of the hotel but found the rooms exceedingly ugly and the walls though not the floor quite cold at night.

Not really any discernable difference between the 3* and 4* rooms that we booked - if anything the 3* one was slightly nicer (4* room had very tatty rug in it which impacted on the overall look of the room). The bathrooms have been mentioned a lot on previous reviews - the system of opening the cupboard doors to create an enclosed bathroom is quite innovative and different and we worked out how to use it pretty quickly. I can understand why some people didn't though and think it would make sense for people checking into those rooms to be told how the bathroom works when they check in to avoid confusion. We arrived to find that we couldn't check in until 3.00pm at the weekend, which hadn't been made clear when the reservation was made and was a bit of a hassle as we'd intended to get changed before heading out for the afternoon. Again - would make sense to just let people know that the check in time is fairly late on in the afternoon so there are no surprises. Overall the website gives a much better impression of the hotel than the reality. I like quirky hotels, but they can be done a lot better than this. A comparable example would be the Malmaison hotel in Oxford which was an old prison and has retained it's quirkiness and character, but has significantly higher quality decor, facilities and service for the same price as a 3* star room in this hotel. The main issue however was the check out process. The reception area is ridiculously small and the queue for checkout was huge which meant that the narrow corridor beside the reception was very crowded and it was hard to be clear who should go next. The checkout process also seemed to be ridiculously slow with numerous phone calls needing to be made and details needing to be checked - this should not have been a complex process. It was as if they weren't used to lots of people checking out at the same time - this was 12.00 on a Sunday - surely they should be used to handling relatively high volumes of people at this time and manage to handle it with a modicum of efficiency. There was an extra room service charge on my bill that I hadn't ordered or signed for, but when I told the receptionist that was the case he said that it could be rectified but it would take a while - it was as if he was expecting me to say 'OK then don't worry I'll just go ahead and pay it to save you time'. When he finally did agree to take the incorrect charge off my bill he wasn't at all apologetic. I then received an e-mail the next day from the night porter who had served me the room service that I actually had ordered (and been more than happy to pay for) saying that I had declined to pay for it and implying that I was lying about having placed the order. This should not have been a major issue - incorrect charges get applied to bills all the time - but when that does happen and it's quite clear that a mistake has been made, hotel staff should deal with it quickly and efficiently and with good grace - not make the guest feel that they are being out of order for refusing to pay for goods that they have not received.

Obvioulsy this hotel is not for everybody. The 'dixi bathroom' is a creation by the Dutch design group Atelier Van Lieshout. Some people find their design unuasal and unpractical, but I guess the Lloyd hotel aims to be an alternative to cookie-cutter chain hotels. I booked the 5* room and when I arrived asked to be shown the available ones as I had heard they were all different. The friendly receptionist accompanied me to 5 different rooms and gave me some explanations. In the end I picked a attic room with a huge pointed room of wooden beams and a large tub in the middle of the room. the bed was large and very comfy. Perhaps 200 EUR is a bit much- but it certainly was vey different from most hotel rooms I stay in. The whole bulding is a gem and very Dutch- and in a way, so are the rooms. They have kept many of the old touches and some furniture- some people would complain about old stuff, others will apprecaiate teh bit of history and authenticity. My only comment would be that the hotel would do well to touch up the paint in the hall ways- many scratchmarks that leave a bit of a worn out first impression. The free wireless internet worked a charm- you also get a free 'adult entertainment' channel at night (confiming one Amsterdam stereotype...) The restaurant/ bar looked nice, there was pleasant live music and an art performance the night I stayed. The surroundings give you the opportunity to explore a different side of Amsterdam, although I think many visitors will still prefer to spend most of their time in the historic center. But there are some bars and shops around and it is all very authetically Dutch- just not as old as the center. My only gripe would be that the tram could run a little more often (currently only once every 15mins at night) So if you are looking for an interetsing alternative in amsterdam, and have an interest in design and art the Lloyd might be for you.

The best thing about the hotel is that it is clean and open - and somewhat secluded. The pricing is not bad for low season. However, the thing to watch out for (and this is demonstrated in some of the other guest complaints) is the unique way in which the hotel categorizes the rooms. I booked for 3 nights and was happy with my room. But, being a category 4 room I expected something a bit more than what I got - it was basic and not interesting- certainly not exceptional. There is much said about the interiors and furniture, etc... but I found that much of it is hyperbole. There is much difference between a 1 and a 5 perhaps - but I suggest you pay close attention to anything in between. Many of the rooms are not much of an improvement on category 1 - except space. But, there are some gems to be found. Just make sure you get one! The public space is well designed and interesting. I visited in the low season, of course, and as such the atmosphere was slower - but I can imagine the Lloyd holds its own when it comes to the high season festivities. I was just pleased to be in Amsterdam and the hotel room sufficed. I suggest, if you are travelling soon, checking out the old Postal building housing the Stedelijk - either in the day or night..... the view is great... especially while dancing!

The whole menu is a la carte and has everything from hummus sandwiches to baked potatoes to scrambled eggs--all served 24 hrs. Prices, however, are on the steep side and there's a whopping 7-euro fee for room service. The building itself is a converted school and prison.
