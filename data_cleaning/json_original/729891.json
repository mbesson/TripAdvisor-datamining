Another reviewer wrote about a bait and switch about 1 month ago, and I read it, and still booked because of all the other positive reviews. However, when I arrived to check in, the couple ahead of me was having trouble. They had booked at APEX, but there was no room for them, so they would have to stay 100 meters away at the \"sister\" hotel. Off they went. So now I go to check in, same situation!! how many rooms are they going to overbook? and I was staying more than one night! So i'm laid back, I go with the flow, go to check out this other hotel. It's called the Moonlight, and it's not the same quality. As the other reviewer said, that hotel is ranked about 100 below this one. The rooms they showed me were 2 star hotel rooms. Don't get me wrong, I'll stay in a 1 star hotel if I want, but I will pay one star prices for it. And the service at Moonlight was very good, they were friendly and helpful. The room was basic, clean, etc. The low rating I am giving here is not for the Moonlight hotel, it's for the trickery of the Apex hotel.

Bad: stingy beyond belief. It became a joke between my wife and me saying: \"sure we have \"x\" ....- but you can't use it!\". There are fan/AC units but they removed the remotes because \"it is not hot enough for ac yet\". There are shower jet panels but the valve handles have been removed. There is a glass cabinet proudly displaying the yogurt, milk, etc that you would like to enjoy for breakfast at the rooftop but it is locked. The server hardly ever gets around to setting these things out and if you ask you can be sure to never have them. Maintenance was lacking also. The shower hose and nozzle were broken so that you could not secure it anywhere and the curtains would not cover the window because of missing hangers or whatever. Overall I got the impression that they would not and have not spent a dime on this place for years. There were other significant problems including losing my reservation but I only have so much time. Also annoying and indicative of level of class here: the manager was outside in the street from 1 to 2 am pacing up and down and talking loudly on his cell phone and disturbing his guests.

Just a few little FYIs for future travelers looking up this hotel on Tripadvisor that are no means criticism of the hotel and absolutely have not been considered in my review : The rooftop terrace, where breakfast is served, can be a bit chilly in the winter as the plastic sheeting that serves to help keep out the elements does not keep out the cold. You may want to bring your coat the first day you are there if traveling in the winter until you determine whether or not it's an issue. If you are looking to book the budget double room, do be aware that at least one of them is on the ground floor near the stairs/computer where you get noise from people coming in/out and using the computer.

Luckily our room was odor free and looked generally clean. The decor was nice, if a bit kitschy. Our triple room had three single beds set in a row and felt a bit cramped at times. The bathroom was small but not tiny and had a modern looking shower. Unfortunately the fancy shower didn't work properly and the water trickled out of the shower head rather than exploded. The hotel has a free wireless internet connection, however the connection on our floor was not working. We reported it to the manager who promised to ask his 'friend' to come have a look at it. It was never fixed and the manager never followed up to see if we still had problems. We worked around the problem by connecting to the hotel's other very weak connection which worked most of the time but was slow and unstable. The hotel has a free breakfast served on the roof top every day from 7:30 to 10:30 but we were turned off trying it by the smell in the lobby. Despite all this, the hotel has some definite pluses. It was the cheapest hotel I found at the time in the Sultanahmet area. The beds were comfortable. The towels and sheets were clean and our room came with 3 nice bath robes in addition to the towels.

My email inquiries were always answered in a timely fashion, and were always polite. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Lokman Yunushan, the person whom I had been emailing with. He could not have been any more hospitable or polite. We were treated like family, and offered our choice of a double room or a triple. Although there were just the two of us, we chose the triple room. It is about the size of a standard US room, but there are three twin beds. The double was very small with only one double bed, so we opted for the extra space. The room was clean and comfortable, with a modern shower and clean bathroom. In the morning, you can go up to the terrace to experience what a breakfast in Istanbul consists of. Keep in mind that you are in Turkey, and do not expect a typical American breakfast. Hard boiled eggs, toast, small sausages, meats, olives, cerial, and other items make up the spread. It is all served with pride by one of the staff members - in our case a very polite young man that wears a bow tie and takes his job very seriously.

The hotel was located within walking distance to all the main sites that we wanted to visit, 5-10 minutes by foot to Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia, Topkapi Palace, the Basilica Cistern, with other sites/locations such as Grand Bazaar, Spice Market and Galata Bridge just a bit further, but still most enjoyable walks (once you learn to ignore the persistent street peddlers/restaurant hawkers). The hotel manager, Mr. Ibrahim Billik, and the front desk managers were genuinely friendly and helpful. They provided directions, sightseeing advice, and a nice welcome whenever we entered the hotel. We had the feeling that the staff would go well out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. There are a few things, in my opinion, of which potential visitors should be aware: first, the rooms are not very large (especially the single room we had on our first night's stay); second, there was no seating in either of the two rooms we had during on our visit, although the second room (a double/triple) would have been large enough to accommodate a small table with a couple of small chairs; and third, we found the breakfasts, buffets on the roof veranda, to be just passable, with small selection of items and eggs that were not quickly refilled when they had already been consumed by other guests. That said, these quibbles were far outweighed by the ways in which this hotel did excel. As mentioned, the location couldn't be better and the courtesy of the staff was superb (also, the neighborhood felt very safe, for anyone concerned with this aspect of travel). The rooms were clean, the beds comfortable, and the air conditioner worked well. While we couldn't sit comfortably in our rooms with no chairs, this was more than compensated for by having available a roof veranda that had wonderful views of the Bosporus in one direction and the Blue Mosque in the other. When my wife and I returned in the evening to the hotel after dinner and/or sightseeing, we would go up to the veranda with some tea or ice cream (not too much wine/alcohol in Istanbul) where we could watch the sun setting on the Bosporus, see the Blue Mosque minarets illuminated by spotlights, and listen to the nightly calls to prayer from both the Blue Mosque and a smaller mosque across the street from the hotel, each muezzin seeming to respond to the others' call with an answering call. It really made Istanbul come alive. All in hotel, we enjoyed our stay at the Apex Hotel and found it to be great value for the money.

When I originally arrived at the hotel I was very distraught, first by the nightmare of a flight from Casablanca to Istanbul, and that topped off with lost luggage. By time I got to the hotel I was in tears, it was 7 in the morning and I hadn't slept for over 24 hours. The first thing I was told to do was get some sleep and we would take care of everything after I rested. When I did wake up I felt a lot better. Ibrahim contacted AMEX for me to discuss my luggage protection plan. He then offered me food, but what was really amazing was that he sent one of his staff to take me shopping for some replacement clothes etc. I was taken from store to store, my bags were carried for me and also my receipts. He also arranged a trip on the Bosphorus for me and a private guide for a tour of the city. Upon returning from these tours he made sure that there were not problems, that the guides were good etc. He also had a friend who helped me plan my trips to Cappadoccia, Pamukkale, and cruise on the Meditterean, from Feythia to Olympos. Now my missing bag arrived 3 days later but was no longer usable. I was leaving early the next morning for the rest of my trip so he lent me his suitcase till I returned to Istanbul. That night I asked where I could get a bottle of wine and he didn't want me to get ripped off so he went to the liquor store and brought back 4 bottles for me to choose from and then took the 3 bottles back to the store. When I returned to Istanbul he again took me shopping for a suitcase after telling me I didn't need one but could keep his. I was even invited to break fast (it was during Ramadan) with him and his friends. I travel extensively around the world and I have never come across service like this from the personel at a hotel. Ibrahim is a hands on owner/manager who goes out of his way to make you feel comfortable and happy. The hotel is very good value, clean, and close to most tourist attractions.

There is an assortment of breads, jams, cheeses, etc. The coffee was great. The AC worked great, and everything was very clean. For the price, the hotel is a fantastic deal, and the staff is the nicest that I have ever come across. I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone that cannot afford ot stay in the swanky four seasons hotel a few blocks away.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "CT", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Hotel with Accomodating Staff\u201d", "Author": "dxzium", "ReviewID": "UR34176336", "Content": "I booked my stay at the Apex Hotel to spend my last night in Turkey and I could wholeheartedly recommend this hotel for the service alone. I arrived in Istanbul from my excursion in Bodrum early in the morning and on my way to the hotel I ran into the service staff who served breakfast who kindly assisted me with my luggage in one hand as he carried fresh groceries in the other. While they did not have an extra room available for me to do an early check-in, they invited me to their breakfast buffet consisting of various juices, coffee, cheeses, sausages, fruits, etc. and some fresh produce / bread from the local market. A modest breakfast overall and a bit different from the Western breakfasts I am accustomed to, but pleasant nonetheless atop the rooftop terrace. The room I had at the Apex seemed rather small compared to most other hotels I've stayed at, but for a single traveler it was more than spacious enough and had a very nice touch of \"home\". The bathroom was also very clean and all the facilities were in good condition. Having been given a tour by the hotel owner and seen the different rooms available at the Apex, it is fair to say this hotel is improving still with flooring and furniture replacements. However, I do have two reservations about the rooms: first, the lighting was inadequate--do not expect to read after sundown in the room without eyestrain; and second, the air conditioner in my particular room did not seem to do much cooling (although the windows were enough for the mild early-June weather). The location of the hotel is great, located in convenient walking distance from all the great attractions including the bazaar. Public transportation (the tram) is a fair ten minutes from the hotel and will take you to the airport (with one transfer-- very cheap and convenient). Note, however, that there are hills near the hotel (meaning sidewalks are littered with steps) and the pavement is close to a brick-like texture of stone. If you have a heavier, rolling, suitcase, it may be difficult to navigate comfortably on foot. Also note that taxis are not allowed to travel through the Sultanahmet area (that separates the tram and the hotel). However, the helpful staff actually assisted me in bringing my bags to the tram (!!), a true example of Turkish hospitality. My overall experience at the Apex was excellent and I encourage anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay at the Apex.", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "vancouver", "Title": "\u201cAPEX Hotel\u201d", "Author": "aussieadanac", "ReviewID": "UR33755122", "Content": "Spent five wonderful days in Istanbul at APEX Hotel.

The best thing about Apex Hotel is its location - in Sultanahmet, so everything that is worth seeing in Istanbul is within a short walking distance. For example it takes just approximatelly 3 (!!) minutes to walk to Blue Mosque, isn't it amazing? :)This hotel is situated quite close to Topkapi Palace, Grand Bazaar and Hagia Sophia as well. Rooms are decorated in a classical Turkish style, they are clean and beds are veeery comfortable ;p ..bathroom is ok too..so no problem at all. Breakfast is served on roof terrace which has a view of the area (Blue Mosque on one side and Sea of Marmara on another side) ..simply amazing!

It was one of 2 on the ground floor. The lighting was really very deficient within the room. The floor was extremely uneven to walk on. The toilet seat, in the bathroom was broken. The sink leaked over the floor, from its base, perpetually. The bathroom, like the room was extremely small. Realising that this situation may have been confined to our particular room, when ascending the stairs to the breakfast room, where there were open doors, we did peer inside to see if there was imprved accommodation on upper floors. To us, there was not really much improvement witnessed, regarding spaciousness. The manager was apologetic and let us know that he was aware of the standard of the room, but stated he had no other to offer. I had booked our accommodation last year. Mainly due to reading reviews on this web site. Booking that far ahead, and being in direct contact with the hotel, several times, prior to arrival, I wrongly assumed that we would be given a better room than we supplied with. The turkish people are very kind and generous and this etablishment is no exception.

I can see elements of everything that has been described, yet overall I feel that the Apex Historic is a favourable venue for a stay. Although staying as part of a business trip, I was relaxed, the weather was hot and the sights & smells of Istanbul were intriguing. In other words I was pleasantly disposed towards my surroundings. Viewed in this light the hotel was small, attractive & had an air of cosiness and intimacy. But fact \u00e2\u20ac\u201c many of the rooms are small, the shower /toilet in my room was very small, as indeed was my room with the double bed filling most of it. The dark colours of the decoration were, let us say different, but did that add to the mystery of Istanbul?

The hotel was a nice place to return to at night but sights & experiences of Istanbul crowded out the memory so the accommodation took a little of a backstage in my thoughts. Its location is close to all the major historic sites, down a quiet backstreet where you are not pestered by people wanting you to dine at their restaurant. Nearby are one or two bars where you can sit outside drinking into the small hours. All in all very convivial surroundings. So I would venture that if you are honeymooning, taking a romantic break with a partner or conducting a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcliaison discreet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 you will find the hotel quite charming, if you are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpassing though\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a pleasant place to stay but if you are more used to the comforts and arrangements of the modern hotel then it could seem to you a little shabby and run down.

It is not a 5-Star hotel, but it's certainly a great place to stay.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antwerp, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cPerfect stay!\u201d", "Author": "Raf-Freya", "ReviewID": "UR16287361", "Content": "Our stay in the Apex Hotel was just perfect. We appreciated a lot the warm welcome and nice explanation about the hotel and Istanbul in general. The rooms are lovely decorated and very clean. We stayed in a room in the back which was very quiet but I think the front rooms are also nice because the hotel is located in a very quiet street. Just around the corner there are some very nice restaurants and shops and the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia and Topkapi palace are only a 5 minutes walk! A pity that they were working on the roof terrace but the breakfast downstairs was also nice (French bread, cheese, salami, marmelades, honey, tea, coffee, olives, eggs,...). A special plus for this hotel is the friendliness of the staff. All of them were always very helpfull and friendly.", "Date": "May 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cFour wonderful days in Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "WoodsIreland", "ReviewID": "UR16165940", "Content": "We have just returned home after four wonderful days in Istanbul. Our stay there was truly memorable due mainly to the hospitaly shown to us by Harun and his staff at Apex Hotel Historical. All the staff were friendly and courteous at all times. We were a group of four people, a German couple and ourselves, an Irish couple. The staff were able to converse in both english and german. Apex Hotel is ideally located -- a few minutes walk from Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosque, Aya Sophia and Basilica Cistern. We had no need for public transport or taxis. Bedrooms were very comfortable, by day 4 we actually slept through the early morning call to prayer from the Blue Mosque !!!

It's amazing the way we have been welcomed in Turkey by Hotel staff: a transfer from Ataturk airport to Apex hotel on a new Mercedes offered by Mr Harun Cadirci (Hotel General Manager), a welcome drink with a taste of typical Turkish sweets at our arrival, little briefing on Istanbul best attractions with informations about distances and means of transport given by desk clerk (all guys are very good, always smiling and helpful). The rooms are well equipped, with much space between bed and bath, kept tidy.... towels changed everyday, minibar, TV... The first reason why everybody should choose Apex Hotel? Because it is 5 minutes walking from the most important beauties.... and it's situated in a very safe quarter where you can find also little restaurants and pub or handicrafts shops.
