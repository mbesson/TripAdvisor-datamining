In the end, we got evicted and the security guard said, I own this hotel. We got evicted, fully charged for both nights even after being told at the front desk we were being charged our security deposit. Long story short, they evicted us under false grounds, took our money, only to rent out the room the following night. This place's security is outsourced by Bell Atlantic, whose employee acted in sheer dislike and disdain to us for NO reason. Management irresponsibly took our money and challenged us in court.

Myself and two friends (all aged 25) booked a 2 bedroom suite that cost $496.32 for the 2 nights. We checked in at about 9pm, dropped off our stuff in the rooms and went out for the night. We returned to the hotel at 2am to go to sleep and this is where the problems began. To enter the hotel you must swipe a key card to get into the main lobby. Two of us entered the lobby, and my other friend was walking about a minute behind us and knocked on the door to let him in as he did not have a card key. We opened the doors to let him in and a security guard standing in the lobby told us we were not allowed to do this. We calmly explained to the security guard that he was a guest of the hotel as well. The security guard proceeded to harass us as we attempted to go to our room. He followed us all the way to our rooms, and as we went into our rooms he told us we were evicted from the hotel for being unruly and noisy. We laughed because this was clearly not the case, closed the door to our room, and went to sleep. At 4am, we awoke to knocking on our door. We opened it and 2 cops were there telling us that we were evicted from the hotel and had to gather our stuff and leave immediately. We asked why we were evicted and were given no explanation, and had no choice but to leave immediately and buy a hotel room elsewhere. The next day we went to the main office of the hotel in an attempt to talk to the manager, just to ensure we weren't charged $500 for a room that we never got a chance to stay in due to the eviction. The people working would not get a manager for us, but assured us that we would only be charged a $220 deposit we put down. The next week we checked if we were charged and found we were charged the full $500. We also checked sites reviewing Casablanca and found that other guests had been scammed the exact same way.

Frankly, it's old, like most properties are. I go into each stay at a new place with that in mind, and don't expect the Ritz Carlton. With that said, Casablanca was definitely one of the better experiences that I have had. We arrived a couple of hours before the 3 PM check-in, but the front desk agents already had our paperwork ready to fill out. Even though we couldn't check in yet, we were allowed to fill it out early so as to make it easier when 3PM came. We also received a parking pass early, which allowed us to hit the beach for a few hours. At about 2:30, the skies darkened and it became clear that a storm was coming quickly. As we packed up our things to head to the car, the front desk staff actually called us to let us know we could check in early. Seriously, great service. Once inside, yes, the building was old. However, the room was plenty for us, and most importantly, was clean. The location is also great. It is on 25th, right off the boardwalk. I've stayed a number of times by the inlet, which seems to be where the crowds go in the evenings. With Casablanca being further down, we could walk to the inlet and enjoy the scene, but go back to the relative quiet of our hotel. I really preferred it.

There were only 2 drawbacks that I have to let other people know about. The first was the elevator. The elevator is so slow it's ridiculous. It also smelled really bad. The second drawback is the ice machine. There is only one ice machine and its located on the ground floor. By the time we were ready to go to the beach, around 10am, the ice machine was totally empty from everyone else filling up their coolers. Most hotels/motels have more than one ice machine. It wasn't a problem because we went next door to the Howard Johnson and used their ice machine!

Last summer, a few of my friends and I went up to OC for a mini vacation before heading back to college. My friend booked this place online....BIG MISTAKE. Guests are not permitted into the hotel after 9 pm...which was not that big of a deal but it would have been great had they told us this before we brought friends back with us. We were also visited several times by a security guard who issued us a pre-eviction notice because of the noise complaints that another room had called in. Now either the walls in this place are paper thin or someone had hyper sensitive hearing because we had a visit from the security guard that night (which was a \"warning\" issued to us at 9:15 pm.... because I'm sure so many of our neighbors were trying to catch some beauty sleep at that hour). The pre-eviction notice came about an hour later due to our refusal to quiet down. We were unaware that sitting around a table and talking at a normal tone was a violation of the contract that we signed. Our drivers licenses (half of us were over 21) were taken to the front desk for some inexplicable reason, and my friend who was paying to stay at this hotel was excorted off of the property where he had to find another place to stay because we exceeded the number of allowed guests per room. Who knew? Luckily a friend was staying at a much friendlier establishment further up the boardwalk and he was able to stay in their room for a night. We thought about leaving Ocean City that night considering we were clearly not welcome by the staff at Casablanca (whom we were paying- don't forget), but decided to stay another night since that was what we paid for...in full...at check in. Rather than staying in, we headed to a few places on the boardwalk and visited various friends' houses. Luckily we avoided getting evicted on night 2...surprise! I would not go to the Casablanca Hotel if I was PAID to stay there another night. Apart from the unfriendly staff and the unreasonable \"contract\" that we apparently violated several times, the place was filthy. The rooms and halls smelled, the furniture on the balcony was broken, and the carpet and sheets were stained.

These guys roam the premise making sure the guests at this \"inn\" are not doing anything inappropriate. And they threaten to kick you out if they do not like what they see. Besides the close location to the boardwalk and beach, this inn has nothing more to offer.

Even tho the place wasn't very clean (& still isn't) and the elevator was scarey (it looks better this year) we decided to come back again this year...BIG MISTAKE!!! We returned to our room one day & realized someone had been in our room.The Do Not Disturb sign was on the door. We had left the radio on & it was off when we returned. We figured they came in to clean anyway. After looking around nothing had been cleaned. Two days later it happened again, this time the trash was pulled & towels left. (the Do not Disturb sign was on the door again) The next morning we were preparing to leave, we packed up most of our belongings and went down to load those items in the car. We knew it would only take us a couple of minutes to run back up to the room to get the last couple of items (a boogie board & a 3ft. piece of painted slate that weighted 40lbs. I bought at sunfest & the extra key card I left on the table.) We were parked on the side of the building so we decided to load the car out the back door. Then my husband parked the car in the back & I took the cart back to the entrance. When I returned to the lobby I saw my husband very upset yelling at the housekeeping guy. When I approached to see what was wrong I saw my slate painting ( that cost over $200.00) & the boogie board in his laundry cart. My husband came in the back door & caught him just before entering the employees only room.( I know we weren't even out of the room for 5 minutes) When my husband ask him what he was doing with our stuff he said he was taking it to the trash.( there was no trash in his laundry cart just our items & a couple of towels) When my husband got louder he said he was helping us. We took our things from him put them in the car & headed back to the room to get the key card I left on the table to find a housekeeper stripping the beds, the key card was gone. We didn't even check out yet! It was 10:20. I proceeded to the office to be met by a smug girl who was trying to act professional. (she was far from it) When I told her what had happened she said \"well if it was in a trash bag he thought it was trash.\" ( I never told her it was in a trash bag) At this point I knew he already told her what had happened & she was covering for him. Then she said \" some people aren't as intelligent as others\" ...Well I don't care how stupid you are you don't pick up a 40lb. piece of painted slate with the price tag on it and think its trash! His only stupidity was he got caught! She said she was making a notation in the file & would inform the owner. She would take care of reprimanding him because that was her job. We should have called the police right then. We decided it wasn't worth the extra hassle we would have to deal with. Being so upset we just left. I could understand them being in the room if it was after 11:00 or we had checked out...but we didn't and that doesn't excuse the fact they had been in the room several times when the DO NOT DISTURB sign was on the door. After returning home we have found we are still very upset that this happened. I wanted to warn anyone concidering staying here what happened to us. I have also decided to contact the owners since I'm sure little Miss Attitude didn't inform them of what occurred.

So I came prepared with a gallon of bleach, a huge bottle of spray disinfectant, and a huge tub of disinfectant wipes. Immediately upon entering the room, I noticed that the bathroom hadn't been cleaned in who knows how long. That isn't to say that grandma housekeeper for that floor didn't take a damp dirty rag and wipe off the surfaces. But the toilet was nasty, the bathtub was nasty, the floor was nasty. All of the dishes in the kitchen cabinets had food on them, including a can opener with caked on tomato sauce. The balcony had trash and a pop can on it, the AC unit had abount one hundred beer bottle tops. So I used 3/4 gallon of bleach in the tub and filled it with hot water, cleaned the toilet and sink with disinfectant and then used the remaining 1/4 gallon bleach on the dirty dishes after I washed them. The sofa bed had a huge spot of blood on the mattress. Since I noticed this at night, I went down and requested 2 sheets and an extra blanket with the idea that I would use the blanket in the closet first, then 2 sheets to cover the mattress and the extra blanket to cover up. I removed the blanket from the closet and discovered that it had blood also, as well as dried cheese all over it. So I had to request actually 2 sheets and 2 blankets. The next morning, my husband went down to the office and addressed our concerns with a dark-skinned female who became so loud and verbally abusive that my husband had to leave the office, as she was not allowing him to talk anyway. We were denied a refund. We were later asked to change rooms, but since I had already spent the first day of my vacation cleaning and sanitizing this room, there was no way in hell I would agree to do that. I asked them to just bring us another mattress for the sofa bed from a vacant room, clean the trash off the balcony and mop the bathroom. None of those things happened. The maid with blue hair came and wiped a few things and left. The same bloody mattress and probably the same trash on the balcony (I REFUSED to pick it up) can probably be found today. Then we were denied houskeeping services for the remainder of our vacation because the old grandma maid was insulted by our complaint. We went down twice and demanded someone come and take our dirty towels and we had to go down nightly and get new ones from the office. The pans were so scratched and rusted that I could not cook a meal. I requested a pot from them to cook pasta and they brought me a skillet (another very scratched one). Oh, back to the dishes...we were told that it is not their job to wash dishes, it is ours. We clarified this with them (we knew we had to wash our own) and they said that included someone else's dirty dishes that we found when we arrived. Because I spent the first day doing nothing but cleaning up from the previous tenants, we stayed an extra day.

I was nervous. We are travelers, and we stay in hotels at least once a month, usually not less than 3 stars. We were looking for a place for our annual girls weekend (we are all in our 20s and 30s), and for the price and location, this seemed great. We had an efficiency room that was clean and more than adequate. The full sized refridgerator was quite an asset. The sheets were clean, the beds and pillows were comfy. Towels were scratchy and thin, but hey, this was a budget hotel. It was crowded with college aged kids, which we expected. The pool was not entirely in the sun and pretty small, so we avoided it. We were only one hotel behind being directly on the sand, and it was very convenient. None of us ever felt put out by running back to the room for snacks or the restroom. We never experienced the hot water problem other people talked about here. We did find that the flushing capacity of the toilet was low, so be sure to use less toilet paper than you're used to. I would totally recommend this hotel for your stay. The price was great, the location was great, and the staff was willing to do whatever you needed.", "Date": "May 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cInsane Reviewers\u201d", "Author": "TheFest", "ReviewID": "UR7714230", "Content": "The people who rated this hotel with 1 or 2 stars must never have traveled to Ocean City, or any other shore town for that matter. My fiancee and I booked one night for Memorial Day weekend. Having traveled during Memorial Day weekend to various East Coast beaches, I knew that the previous occupants on Friday and Saturday would have been a bit rough on the room. Fortunately, if they were, all traces were removed by the hotel staff. Listen, the rooms weren't the nicest in the world. I wouldn't eat off the carpet or choose those comforters for my house. I'm sure rooms like that exist somewhere in someone's imagination at these prices. In my many years of shore travel, it doesn't happen that way. You want luxury, spend twice as much. I had an ocean view balcony for less than she and I spent on lunch and dinner. What more could you ask for? The TA reviewers need to change their diapers and get a grip. Additionally, I found the staff to be pretty nice in all my dealings (reservation, check-in, check-out, housekeeping). I automatically give hotels a +1 star when reading the reviews on this site simply because people are such whiners.", "Date": "May 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "scranton,pa", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Vacation!\u201d", "Author": "katie21488", "ReviewID": "UR7701024", "Content": "We stayed from May23-25 2007.

Stay At The Tidelands Caribean Same Moneis !!! We booked this hotel for Sun July 16-19, 2006 a double effy. with a sofa bed for 5 people. $185.00 pr-night discounted rate through Hotels.com regular rate $209.00. TOTAL $628.83 We paid for it on our credit card and was confirmed with an email from Hotels.com-with confirmation of 3 adults --2 children for Sun-Wed. I called the Casablanca Oceanside Inn on Friday 7/14/06 and talked with a woman at the front desk and confirmed our room 2 double beds--stove-ref-sofa bed and # of people in our party-smoking- ocean view--pool--confirmed late check in between 8-9PM-- We left on Sunday late afternoon heading for Ocean City for a family vacation. I called the hotel at 8:30Pm talked with a gentleman and told him we were going to be there around 9:30PM--He said Okay your room is secured and paid with a credit card.... Well were we SHOCKED we found the hotel on 24th St. we had to park next door at the Howard Johnson\u2019s Hotel just to check-in we went in the office it was run-down and I asked to see the room before we checked-in. The guy gave us the key to our room and we went to look at it--the elevator floor had water all over it-- a hazard waiting with cermic tile when it is wet--but we overlooked it we were TIRED after driving 5.5 hours.. We got off the elevator to bright Mint Green walls painted-hallway had a musty smell and dirty floors--We proceeded to our room and opened it up and thought $185. Pr-night for this--the web site shows NICE rooms they were okay at best a little run down ..We could not see the ocean from our room we could see a concrete bldg behind us. The balcony overlooked the pool BUT I was leery of letting my kids swim in...But I figured they could swim in the ocean. We went to check-in and make do with what we had--IT WAS LATE -I asked about parking they told us across the street in a parking lot--( I thought we would have fun unloading and then trying to crossing 2 lanes of traffic...) Then they tried to charge us $120.00 extra plus tax of 9% because there was 5 of us. I questioned them pretty hard and showed them our email from Hotels.com showing 5 total people in our party and said we paid for it on a credit card you accepted payment and I called etc . to verifty just 1 hr. ago--they would not let us check-in they said Hotels.com did not tell us everything etc...after 15 mins of getting NO WHERE but them half laughing at us---I requested to talk with the Manager of the site they called her and she was RUDE and told us if we did not pay the monies we did not have a room. It is listed on their own web-site the extra charges etc... if we did not stay we would be subject to a cancellation policy of 1 night stay of $185.00 plus $25.00 fee Charged to our credit card----I told her no way were we paying this extra money and we already paid for this room with Hotels.com at a discounted rate--she hung up on me. ---- I asked the front desk to use their phone and I called our credit card company and put the charges into dispute right there on the spot--the one guy was half laughing and said they still would still charge it it was their policy.. We left the hotel and sat in a parking lot on a cell phone with Hotels.com they WERE GREAT and understanding !!!!!!!! They refund all of our monies after calling the hotel itself and verifying the events that took place and then the Casablanca said we could come back and they would not charge us the extra money- I told Hotels.com no way they were laughing at us and were VERY RUDE and the hotel is not worth the money--Hotels.com said that is not their policy once you pay for a room their are no future monies due at check-in.. We tried to use Hotels.com to find us another hotel nothing was available for Sun. night at this point it is now 11:40PM. We drove around checked 3 hotels and FINALLY found a hotel at the Tidelands Caribbean Hotels and Suites on 4th St. we stayed there and had a WONDERFUL ROOM--A king size suite with kitchen for the same monies if we would of paid the extra monies that the Casablanca wanted.
