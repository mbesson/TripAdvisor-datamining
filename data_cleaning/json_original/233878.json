The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was perfectly adequate, and we only paid something like 33 euro for one night, so it was a bargain. It was very near the train station, so was very convenient after a long train trip to access.

The staff were the most unhelpful I have ever met and although the receptionist had a badge saying that she spoke English, she could not understand the simplest of questions.

And we (or sometimes just myself) always stay at the Ibis Spandau where you're only steps away from the S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations (and a big mall, too). Walk a couple of blocks beyond and you're in Spandau's pleasant Altstadt (Oldtown) where there are restraunts and bakeries. Although Spandau is in the far-west of the Berlin municipality, the S-Bahn trains run frequent and will get you to the center in less than 30 minutes. Access to Tegel (TXL) Airport requires a transfer from the U7 to a bus but can also be done in less than 30 minutes. Regional DB trains run hourly direct to Sch\u00f6nefeld (SXF) Airport but that takes an hour. The hotel itself is the usual clean/modern Ibis with slightly larger bathrooms.
