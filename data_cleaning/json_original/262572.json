Rooms ar quite spacious, well appointed [small tele though] and clean for the price. Desk service was efficient although some questions of surrounding services and amenities were unable to be answered, clearly their world opens and closes at the front door. Easy walk to local rail services into city centre and very suprisingly quiet for a motel so close to major roadway and the airport flight path. Will stay there again in the future.

However, since we've left we have realised a very expensive torch we had is missing. The only reason we took it out of our car was so that it would not get stolen. We contacted the hotel the afternoon we left and asked them to search the room. They have told us that it is not there. We don't have it, they claim it hasn't been found so the only explanation is that it was taken at some stage during our stay.

Only 5 minute walk to Metro station....into town 10 minutes. Room Wi-Fi the best quality (5 bar) I have ever had in years. Fox Sports channels for free. Staff extremely pleasant and helpful. Seen a couple of bland reviews online. Probably from rich idiots obviously used to staying in huge luxury Hotels which would cost twice to three times this cost. Good quality rooms, not hugely luxurious but with the earlier mentioned great positives this Hotel is an 8-9 out of 10. If I came back to Sydney yes I would stay here again.

We paid $119 for the night and was definitely value for money. Staff were very good, rooms basic but clean and comfortable. My husband was impressed with information and services provided such as the hotel room guide giving details on getting around or finding the closest restaurant . One tip from the hotel guide was how not to be taken advantage $$ buy taxi drivers, if the taxi driver doesn't now how to get to your designation quickly insist they use the GPS. Well done to the staff and Management .

The rooms were spacious and clean. They were service daily. The only annoyance was the shower did not have doors. This meant that whenever you have a shower, the entire bathroom would get wet. The hotel has one washing machine and dryer free of use for guests. We were impressed with the friendliness of the staff. I probably won't recommend this for tourists wishing to see the main sites of Sydney, eg. Opera House, Harbour bridge, etc. unless you have a car. There is a nearby train station which is around a 10 minute walk.

I would recommend this place if: If your young and need a cheap place to sleep, If you just broke up with your wife and are living out of your car, If you are living on the streets and have gathered enough coins from singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' on the pavement on George Street, and want to lay your head on something slightly more hygenic than a dead rat.

But this is really basic with no trimmings at all. I arrived after driving straight through from Melbourne, and the air conditioner, jug and television were all not working. And the bathroom had no plug. I complained (mildly) at the front desk but the woman made it clear nothing would be done that evening. The rooms have no windows- just a small balcony overlooking the incredibly noisy street- and the room got quite stuffy until the a/c was fixed the next day. A railway station is only a 10 minute walk away which is handy, but when driving out of the motel you only have a left turn and it's quite a performance to get the car pointed towards Liverpool and beyond.
