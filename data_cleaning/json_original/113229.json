This hotel missed all the main advancements. It's too bad, for the location and the size of the rooms are very nice. But here are a few of the things this hotel DOES NOT have or is a problem: 1. Ice and Ice buckets--none in sight. 2. An Alarm clock--This is the first hotel I have been in without a clock radio. 3. Pens and Memo pads. 4. A flatscreen TV. It had a 19 inch tube TV. (with Bad cable picture) 5. A shower an adult can fit in....there's was 24\" x 24\" 6. Mircowave cord could not reach a socket...we had to put it on the floor! 7. Shower head at neck level--try to wash your hair in a 4\" sq ahower! 8. As cheap of furniture as possible.....tops lifting due to a coke bottles sweating. 9. Rusted out shower door hinges. 10. Wobbly, misfit shower water valves and handles. 11. Rusted out shower drain. 12. Standard toilet...not elongated like most hotel toilets. Brand new btw, and an elongated would have plenty of room, but there were too cheap to spend another 30 dollars. 13. Smallest bar (?) of soap from China that I have ever seen. No lotions, mouth wash, etc 14. 8\" thick mattress. (most are 12,14, or 16\") 15. No desk, no chairs...only two Kitchen chairs (sans kitchen). 16. Outlets without covers. 17. The hallway to the room was dim, dank and dark. Picture a 30's NYC tenement. 18. Very thin towels. 19. No FREE internet. 20. Water in pool unheated and unusable. 21. No place in bath to place cosmetics. No shelves. Everything had to be placed in a medicine cabinet (retail value $22.00) 22. Disk clerk on phone with BF for extended periods of time. This place has NO decor, and is so dirty as to wonder why they clean at all. When we booked, at had been 5 years since I last stayed here, and I thought they may have made some improvements. No dice.

As a member of the Magic Castle, I have stayed here many times to be walking distance to the Castle. I was delighted to see the lobby and many of the rooms have been renovated. I stayed in a 1 bedroom suite and really enjoyed the room (ask for the ones that face West. They are sunnier, often have private balconies and vaulted ceilings). I especially like rooms 217 - 221. We had a beautiful kitchen, full living room, table for 4 inside and out, renovated white bathroom with pedestal sink, and the bedroom was roomy with a large walk-in closet (and a nice view of the pool and mountains). Each day when we would come in, the room was freshly cleaned and smelled good. Breakfast is just continental, expect coffee, some type of bread to toast, jelly / cream cheese. Hot cocoa was available too and some juice boxes if you have kids. We almost stayed on Sunset Blvd and I'm so glad we didn't - because we would have had a MUCH higher bill. Here we didn't pay for parking, we could get a soda or water for a dollar, Wifi is just $10 day and free in the lobby, the room was twice as big as average. I have found if you need something, just ask - they'll give you extra towels, loan you a hair dryer, and Marie can likely arrange for you to get a pass to the Magic Castle (try Sunday Brunch). Also a bonus is what is nearby. It's just a block to the Kodak Theatre and the mall over there - lots of food and shopping (Sephora, Mac, Victoria's Secret, CVS, California Pizza Kitchen, Cirque du Soliel, Walk of Fame, etc). And behind the hotel you go up to Yamashiro and have the best view in LA. (The hotel is on the Hollywood tour because it is where Janis Joplin died - so you might be able to catch the tour at the hotel, I'm not sure). Also nearby is a big, mountainous public park where you can hike and enjoy the day. I'll stay again and continue to stay. The hotel is dated on the exterior, but I like that old Hollywood 60's look. Just remember the rooms can vary a lot in size and how they feel inside.

When we came to check in the front desk guy reminded us that we would be getting the \"not yet remodeled room\", and claimed we already had been notified about that. No where did we see this mentioned when we booked the hotel room or was told about that. We went up to look at the room, and it was disgusting and looked like a room that hadn't seen maintenance or updating in 50 years. It smelled like the doors and windows had been closed for just as long. We complained about this room, because it was in a completely unacceptable unliveable state. I've never in my life seen as bad a room as this (and I've been to some shady places in my life). We got moved to a remodeled room. While this was better, the state of this room is what I would have been expecting from a room that's \"not yet remodeled\". There were several items that were more or less broken. Not so broken that it didn't work, but so broken that I would never rent out a room in that state. Generally it felt like nothing is repaired until it's completely broken. Electrical outlets was missing cover plates, wires were coming out of the walls, the aircondition cover was knocked half-way off and had a power cable across the floor to an uncovered outlet. Holes in the ceiling, termite infested walls. Several of these things are as far as I know illegal! The iron was missing, and I requested one. One was fairly quickly delivered, but it had burnmarks on the bottom (would have left ugly stains on your clothes). I filled it with water and plugged it in, and minutes later noticed that the water was pouring out and down the wire. I got this replaced with a completely new one, but it's a good example of the hotel only replacing stuff when it gets completely broken, and not fixing stuff that's dangerous or unpresentable. Some things had been fixed, but done in a way where there was lots of original (old) interior, combined with new replaced cheap stuff which wasn't true to the original interior (which is a shame because this could have made it a really cool 70s style hotel).

Small breakfast items are included (bagels, bread, muffins, coffee, etc.) in the little breakfast nook off the front desk. Nothing too special about it, but nice to have as no coffee maker was in our room. You can easily walk to Hollywood Boulevard, Kodak Theatre, Grauman's Chinese Theatre, and the Hollywood/Western subway station, but Franklin Avenue is essentially a four-lane river of fast-moving cars.

This being said, the Highland Garden hotel is only a block away from Hollywood Blvd., and a 5 minute walk from Mann's Chinese Theater. The rooms were clean and simple. The decor probably hasn't been updated from the late 70's. I thought that this was all pretty cool, but others may not.

The rooms had very large, nearly 'walk-in' closets, tons of dressers, etc. I was very satisfied with the size of the room and the cleanliness of the room. It's true, it could probably need a fresh coat of paint, new drapery, etc., but for the money you can't beat it. Each room has a sliding glass door with a little porch or balcony overlooking the central courtyard, which is fully enclosed by gates. The only way to get to this courtyard is by either passing by the front desk, or from one of the rooms. Their is no outside access. As for the parking garage, I thought it was excellent! It is dark, but the only way to get in is by buzzing the front desk from your car. There are video camera's all over the place, and they verify that you're a guest and automatically 'open the gate.' It is a little creapy down there, but when you realize that theres no way for anyone else to get in, and that there are camera's everywhere, you get over it.

Ok, I was also a little miffed as to why the disinterested receptionist wanted my card for a $100 deposit, but I asked the right questions and got the right answers. I would suggest that anyone who stays here & is faced with this predicament, do asks for a valid receipt; it would save hassle later. The rooms themselves were very large, with two double beds. Our room was on the 2nd floor and overlooked the pool; a perfectly nice retreat. However, it was a srtuggle getting upstairs & the receptionist wasn't fazed by the image of the two staggering with many bags and suitcases. But i suppose 'porter' wasn't in his job title. We didn't let this bother us. The only problems we had with the room was 1. the lack of lighting and even then the owner was keen to oblige in putting in a new bulb. He was very accommodating. And 2. The so-called 'continental breakfast' wasn't worth mentioning in the hotels description (a danish to me isn't a breakfast!) The location however, couldn't be better. It's within walking distance to all the great landmarks; Beverly Hills, Hollywood Blvd, Manns Chinese theatre & even the Hollywood/Highland metro station is just minutes away.

It was nice the chill out for an afternoon; after the hectic daytrips and long evenings. This was the only time we really stayed at the hotel. The rest of the time it was solely used as a base. Here's a few pointers to those who plan to stay here; * Don't judge on appearance; the outside decor is not particularly attractive or interesting, but inside there's far more character. Be warned this isn't to everyones taste! * Remember what you paid - and I believe you do get what you pay for * Ask for a receipt for that deposit *And make use of the free internet access in the lobby & the pool.

I suppose someone could leave a message at the front desk. - the hotel is showing its age. Even in the renovated rooms, you ccan tell you're in an older building. It didn't really matter to me, but it might be important to some people. Incidentally, on expedia.com it says that continental breakfast is included in their rate. The hotel does not have any dining facilities at all, so I can't imagine how they could offer continental breakfast. There is a pot of foul-looking coffee in the lobby at all times, though. For the money, this is a convenient, comfortable place to stay. It is not geared toward businesspeople at all (no alarm clock, no voice mail, no business center), but would be good for tourists.", "Date": "August 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "gardner, ma", "Title": "\u201cHollywood hits a highspot with Highland gardens hotel\u201d", "Author": "dinghydame", "ReviewID": "UR5699896", "Content": "Recently I brought a group of Special Olympic swimmers to California for a vacation and stayed at the Higland Gardens.

All of the staff were very friendly, helpful and charming. The hotel built in 1957 had all the charm of classic mid-century California architecture with a courtyard pool. Our suites were newly remodeled, large and clean. The large three bedroom had a bath and a half, full kitchen, dining area, pull out sofa and a balcony overlooking the pool. The grounds were lush with flowering trees and vegatation, very pretty. Highland Gardens is located on Franlin Ave. one block north on Hollywood Blvd. (Hollywood walk of Fame) and one block east of LaBrea, making it central to all the Hollywood sights and major roadways.

The owners are Hollywood natives, they have relationships with all the services someone staying from out of town needs, black car, cab, area club and restarant reservations etc. This is a family owned and operated hotel. It was definately \"old\" at one point and needed a remodel. Well it is getting it. When I reserve a room I always ask if it one of the remodelled ones. Fresh paint, tile floors, new furniture, TV's in everyroom, and better lighting. Everything is fine here for the money. I'm tired of listenting to people trash this hotel. I've never seen any of the horrific things people post on this site. Cigarette butts in beds?!? Ridiculous! As for the post about rude staff, I think most everywhere staff in hotels are considered rude if they don't respond to you immediately. If you want to experience rude staff then stay at a haute hotel for $390.00+ per night and get attitude from a hotel employee who decided since you don't drive a Rolls Royce you're not alive. So if you want a night or a week, remember it's not the Ritz, it is what it is.
