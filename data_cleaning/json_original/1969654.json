Many buses from central go to pok fu lum. When u are in the bus there is a indicator to show u the next stop. When u reach pok fu lum reservoir , ring the bell, the next stop is pok fu Lum village. Cross the main road in front and the sign lead u to cuisine training school, VTC pokfuklum complex, guards are all there to guide u. Bus no. 40, 40M, 46x, 970,97o, 973 all go to pokfuklum. I travel mostly by 40m to LAN Kwai Fong, central and return the hotel late at night. No problem, very safe. Check in is smooth and room is spacious and the view is spectacular. When u r up the peak, u see the same view of the pokfulum side on the peak. I got a gigantic king size bed, soft linen. Fast wifi nice cookies. No tv paid channels , you got to watch live telecast at LAN Kwai fong which is a very short walk by bus. Octopus card is very useful and travel by bus is the cheapest, no doubt very often u got stuck in the jam. MTR is the fastest but lots of walking to the trains.

I've traveled extensively but can never ever say I've been given the royal treatment -until now. From the moment I arrived I felt special! Even though I was traveling solo I was given spacious accommodations (bath suite with separate tub and shower, king size bed, turn down service with cookies and chocolates every evening). The view was incredible,the best of both worlds, mountain and ocean views. The breakfast was very good, the staff friendly, reliable and very welcoming. The omelet station chef remembered exactly what I liked and would offer it every morning without my having to ask. When I decided the coffee was too strong the manager came to inquire if anything was wrong and offered me a latte which took care of the rest of the trip's caffeine requirements nicely : ) I went down to the lobby one morning to request a taxi and felt like a rock star, with staff falling over themselves to accommodate me, make me comfortable, keep me updated with the taxi arrival status. I almost had to pinch myself to ensure I was not dreaming! Some things to note: The hotel is in a quiet location, a little out of the way but makes for a restful, quiet evening. You will have to carry a card with the address for the taxi drivers to ensure you get back, and keep an eye out yourself sometimes for the Chinese Cuisine Cooking School sign so you do not pass the hotel. There is no pool either, which I know is important to some but did not bother me. They have a small gym but it is ample enough, and they also have yoga mats and free weights. Regrets: That I never had the time to eat there, except for breakfast. I understand the food is quite good. And my only other regret is that the spa was closed.

We were visiting our daughter who lives and works in Hong Kong. The hotel comprises the 6th floor of an anonymous office building that is not well known to taxi drivers, so we suggest you print off the address and directions to get you there by cab. Once in the building the standard of decoration, fixtures, fittings and cleanliness are what you would expect from a high end hotel and the standard of service from everyone you meet surpasses any I have come across anywhere. Every staff member and trainee treats all guests like royalty, you will be greeted, doors opened, lifts called and your every request will be dealt with in a genuine desire to help in a kind and friendly manner. The rooms are large, well equipped and furnished. We had an ocean view room, with a glorious view that is shared by the deck alongside the dining room. The mini bar is well stocked and priced like a supermarket. You will have tea and coffee making facilities, an iron and ironing board, bath robes, a good room safe, free quality Wifi, international standard recharging facilities, LCD TV, including a small TV and waterproof remote in the bathroom and the best shower I have ever had in a hotel. Every evening the turn down service will leave slippers, cookies and chocolates, an ice bucket and a bath toy. All for a very reasonable and affordable price - believe me I did my research. The room price includes breakfast, unusual in itself. The breakfast buffet is extensive to suit both European/ American and Asian tastes and the service is impeccable. We ate there on several evenings at a reasonable price and while the menu was limited what we had was very good. If you stay over a Friday evening see if you can secure a table for their speciality banquet. This was held in the beautiful, traditional surroundings on the 8th floor and was a real treat, a set banquet of specialities from a region of China, Szechuan, in our case. Immaculate. Don't be concerned that the hotel is staffed by trainees, they are very well supervised and their willingness to learn and anxiety to help more than makes up for any nervousness. Also don't be concerned by the hotel's location. There is a bus stop just on the road outside the hotel. Buy an octopus card and experience Hong Kong's cheap and effective public transport system.

T-Hotel is a training hotel which operates as a legitimate functioning hotel but is training staff through this process [always under supervision of experienced workers or managers]. I have TripAdvisor to thank for finding it & am very grateful that I did. Godwin Ho was the manager who was there on our arrival night & helped us throughout our stay. It is a very nicely appointed hotel which is around 10-15 minutes maximum from central Hong Kong island [and cabs are very affordable, mostly the cab trips cost us around $8-10 Australian dollars maximum at whatever time of day/night]. The hotel is not always easy to find initially, it may help you to state to cabbies that it is located next to the Chinese Culinary Training institute, you can also speak to their dispatch English speaking counterparts via 2way radios in the cabs]. As some have indicated perhaps it feels overly deferential at times with all the staff at hand to take care of needs but not suffocatingly so. The views of South China sea are very beautiful so if possible try to secure an ocean view room. There is a restaurant on the 6th floor whose breakfast is very good & they will also provide lunch & dinner from a set menu at very good prices. Also room service items were incredibly affordable compared to other mainstream commercial hotels. Overall I feel we were in for all intents & purposes in a very nice \u2018normal\u2019 hotel for a much reduced rate. By the way at one point we considered a suite [for approx $400 Australian a night] which is amazing, with amazing views. Do it for us, as we felt we couldn\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t afford it. PROS: Very good service. Free Wi-Fi. Only hotel including Harbour Grand, to offer ipod compatible speakers. Not fantastic sound though. Good location to be out of town yet accessible to it, & particularly the amazing views of South China Sea [if having ocean view room, or being in the restaurant]. There is a shopping centre with Western food choices inc Maccas/Pizza Hut not 1 kilometre behind the hotel. Very good food particularly buffet breakfast, with a decent range of Western options & a chef onhand to make eggs in whichever form you would prefer, scrambled, omelette etc]. Great views to enjoy any meal of the day with the option to sit outside on a parallel balcony. Good \u2018Aqua\u2019 toiletries. They also provided cute little rubber toys every day upon cleaning. Bathrooms also have a tv over bath which is nice, including a film window to reveal, or not, views to the room & outside if preferred. CONS: Connected to the good, & earnest, service, is the issue of language barriers, for instance my room service pasta one evening was an altogether wrong order. Although this could happen anywhere. Not great English tv options, although you can get by on Asian \u2018pearl\u2019 network which provided us some Hollywood options at night including Spiderman etc. A female manager tried to move us to another room [\u2018mountain view room which was more of a balcony than some low mountain behind] & was fairly brusque about it. The reason was due to a shower door which was getting stuck & leaking. She was more friendly & explanatory to my husband than myself; this is likely related to cultural reasons also where is it a more male dominated culture.

We let 2 of them stay one day and play video games in the room while the rest of us toured Hong Kong. They said it was their best day of the vacation. The hotel and staff are peaceful and you feel well cared for. They really focus on making sure you are happy. The rooms are fabulous and spotless. They have considered every detail for your comfort. There were lots of ooohs and ahhhs from the kids when we were showed our rooms. The taxi driver from the seaport seemed put out that we were going off the beaten path and kept telling us he had never heard of this hotel. He found it with no problem and the many times we went back and forth to Hong Kong, there were no problems either. The location is quite convenient and we were glad to stay here. It seemed just a 15 min ride to wherever we needed to go. The view at breakfast is fabulous. It is so nice that it makes you want to linger all day. Our rooms had a view of the other side which was also very nice. We came to Hong Kong thinking we were going to buy custom made suits. We did not feel these were a great deal and the quality we saw was not great either. My son had a fabulous silk and wool suit and 2 shirts made in Vietnam a month before for $80. Here the suits were $300 and up and not so nice. We decided not to waste our time. We found no great deals on shopping either. You can buy the same things in the US cheaper. The food is a good deal in Hong Kong and we loved that. My daughters had their long hair cut and styled at a salon for $12 each. They did a fantastic job so it was a great deal. We pay $50 each in the US for the same thing. We went up the long escalator to the mid cities and that is a trip not to miss. It was beautiful, scenic, and lush. We also visited the zoo and the children's museum and highly recommend them. I would skip having high tea at the Peninsula as many recommend. It is severely overpriced and the people who work there are pretentious. I was told I was not dressed appropriately as I had on a dressy pair of sandals (I knew not to wear flip flops). People in Hong Kong think feet are dirty and do not want to see them. Maybe this is why the Chinese used to bind feet...they don't like them. If I had on a pair of sneakers, I could have gotten in. We didn't want to after we saw the prices. We went instead for dim sum which was fabulous at a fraction of the cost. After a long day on our feet one of my daughters and I decided to get a foot massage. We found a nice little place in the main shopping area. During our massage the other girls working there started bringing nervous looking business men to the back rooms. We realized too late that the girls here were prostitutes. It is so unfortunate for the women (and children and families) of Hong Kong that this practice is so prevalent. It seems everyone here speaks English and they are very good to Americans. My girls became facebook friends with a young waiter who was excited to take photos with them to show his friends.

When we had a family event on, and a few of us were in hong kong, I offered to try this place out. The family friend was so positive about this place and before we checked in I thought that it can't be that good - but it really is... The deal is that you stay in a stunning 5 star standard room for a very reasonable price. Its based on the 6th floor of a Chinese cookery school. The down sides are that it's about a 15 min drive into central hong kong and the staff are all in training. However, I would say the downsides are not that bad - there is a bus stop right outside and we never waited more than 3 mins for a bus to central. A bus to central is about 50 pence (gbp). The hotel are willing to order cabs but we did wait a while so it's just as quick to get the bus. Most of the time, we got a taxi back to the hotel - cost around 70 hkd (about \u00a36 gbp) but its a good idea to have one of the hotel cards with you as a few taxi drivers were not aware of this facility. You have to be a bit patient with the staff as they are all in training, but what they lack in experience and confidence they make up for in eagerness, also I should say that there is always an experienced supervisor around so they step in when things may be taking a bit to long or they lay the cutlery out incorrectly for example. Other plus points are that the drinks in the mini bar, and at the bar, plus dinner are all very very reasonably priced. We had a bottle of wine for 88hkd (\u00a37 gbp) - bet you wont find that in any other hotel, and there are some lovely sea views from the rooms and bar terrace. Another tip from someone who has been to hong kong a few times - the hotel is very near pokfulam country park, and there is a great walk up to the peak. Go to the park and at the gate, turn left up a big flight of stairs. At the top of the stairs bear right and you'll join a path. Follow the path round to you get to a road.

First tip when arriving, get the airport express train to Hong Kong Station, then a taxi. We bought tourist Octopus cards that included 2 single airport transfers plus all trains for any 3 consecutive days and you can add money to use on buses, ferries and lots of other stuff (dead simple, we are both over 60 and we managed it!!). Any money you add is refunded if not used. Tip2 print off the hotel info sheet, keep it with you as its invaluable to know which buses drop at the hotel. We arrived early and we got into the room no problem. We had an ocean view room, really nice, spotless, just as the pictures indicate. Mini bar is very cheap. We don't usually use it but we did here. The room was very quiet. Staff very helpful, obviously a little nervous and sometimes slower when carrying out tasks, but that doesn't detract from the experience. Tip 3 - book early for Friday dinner special, we didn't and it was fully booked. Breakfast was OK. Because they are dealing with relatively small numbers the buffet is not particularly well stocked and could be hotter but it is more than adequate. We tried to tip the person who brought our cases, but we're politely told that as it was a training hotel, they could not accept tips. The location might be an issue for some, but be advised the transport system is very efficient. We used mainly buses from the hotel to the centre (15 mins) and dont think we ever waited more than 3 or 4 minutes because there's a lot of options. When coming back on the bus, just remember to watch for a couple of blue Chinese Institute signs followed by a blue road sign with an exit signed to Pok Fu Lam and hit the bell. Central bus terminus is a good place to get the bus back because one stop is used for all the buses that pass the hotel (not M74). When leaving, book the complimentary hotel shuttle to HK station and check in there, including dropping cases. You can then carry on looking round HK if your flight isn't till later in the day. This was our first trip to HK, but if we ever return, we would definitely consider staying here. It was a real find. Tourist tips, big bus gives a good insight into the place. We found the weather clearer in the afternoon, so bear this in mind when doing the peak, which is a must. Sha Tin races was excellent, even on Derby day it was comfortable, but take your passport to get a tourist members badge (\u00a315) , then you can sit (Yes sit!) in line with the finish line if you want to!

It is indeed amazing value for money, specially in HK. I have initially booked our whole family (7 adults + 3 children) in Ibis Hotel in Northpoint \u2013 but after looking at Trip Advisor reviews, decided to switch hotels. We spent 2 of our 4 night stay in HK in T Hotel (Dec 2011). The first 2 nights were spent in Disneyland Hotel \u2013 which is a beautiful hotel in itself (see my review for Disneyland Hotel), but quite expensive for A$320/room only/night. T hotel on the other hand, is only around HK$905 (A$ 120) for 2 adults/room/night and this rate includes buffet breakfast. We didn\u2019t have any problems with checking in \u2013 it probably took around 20min to do that, but this is almost the same with other hotels, specially when you have to wait in a long line of guests checking in. Our hotel rooms were all surprisingly big, even better than what I\u2019ve seen in the photos. The view from the room was just beautiful \u2013 even if we were just on the 6th floor (or 7th floor \u2013 I can\u2019t remember), it seemed like we were on a higher floor with beautiful views of the sky and the sea. The bed was king sized and very comfortable. There was a sofa by the huge window, and a work desk which had everything a business traveller will need. The bathroom was also well appointed, with a separate bath tub and shower cubicle. I cannot tell you how much I detest having a shower over a bath tub \u2013which is the normal practice for a lot of hotels to save on space and still be able to give you the option to use a tub. What I really loved was the TV inside the bathroom! The complimentary toiletries were also of good quality. And the minibar was more than reasonably priced \u2013 even cheaper than 7-11. As we arrived at the T Hotel past lunch time, we decided to have lunch in one of their two training restaurants. Was pleasantly surprised at how inexpensive the meals were \u2013 a bowl of beef noodle soup was only HK$40 (A$5.25), and their beef massaman curry (which was very good!) was only HK$60 (A$8). All other meals were priced similarly. All meals also come with a complimentary bread basket \u2013 which was baked fresh every day. I would have been happy just eating the bread. Getting to Central or the Kowloon area was easy enough, by catching a bus right in front of the complex. The hotel will give you a printed out guide for which bus to ride depending on your destination. Getting back however, has always been a problem for all of us \u2013 with either the bus not being in service at the time we try to get back to the hotel (if past 11pm, quite difficult). It is recommended to take a taxi from Central back to the hotel \u2013 it\u2019s very convenient, and is only around HK$60-80 (A$8-10). On getting back to the hotel, we were all pleasantly surprised that we had a plate of chocolates, a bucket of ice and the bed has been turned down. It was a nice touch to their service. The breakfast, though limited in selection, was good. They have continental, asian and a hot selection of food to choose from. The pastries were quite good, similar to their bread. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to HK. The hotel is excellent value for money, and the staff, though still in training, are all very eager to please and would go out of their way to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable.

We've stayed at the 6/F for 3D/2N, & would go out from time to time to appreciate the rest of HK, but the minimal stay we had in the hotel gave a great lasting impression. If ever I would go back to HK, this is the ONLY option in my list. Best experienced yourself.

The taxi ride costs approximately HK$60 one way and buses are aplently just outside the hotel. Apart from the slight downside on the location, the hotel is awesome. The room and toilet are spacious, clean and with lots of toiletries. The best part is that you are paying a small price for great sea view!

I will be coming back next year, for work, and i only want to stay in this place... A taxi ride to Wanchai or Central is about 15/20 minutes ( depending on traffic) and cost 60/70 HK ..

First of all, the website of the hotel, so you can check it out or even book through it (which is recommended) is http://www.vtc.edu.hk/thotel/index.html. The reason that this hotel is much cheaper than similar others is that the hotel is run/operated by trainees of the Vocational Training College of Hong Kong (always under the supervision of experienced managers) as the whole organization is an educational institution for tourism! Before i'll give you the hotel facts so you can deside for yourself i'll have to inform you that by saying Hong Kong someone usually means, the whole area, which is the (rather small) island of Hong Kong and the bigger area which is called Kowloon. As you can easily imagine, the properties on the island of Hong Kong are way more expensive than the other ones. So, you have to deside where you want to stay as the hotels in Hong Kong island are expensive (as all of the properties over the island, for example the rent of a 2bedroom appartment costs about 3,500US$ per month) except this one, the T hotel, which has an average cost of 90euros or 120USD per night, including breakfast and an ocean view room ! Absolutely worth it ! The good news about the T hotel are, * Everything looks (and is) brand new. *Beatiful reception / entrance. Don't get fooled by the first look, the entrance area is inside the complex and it is very beatiful! *You will feel very welcome! Always! As the trainees are trying hard to do their best, you'll benefit from that - though sometimes it takes a bit more time (like 5-10mins more) for some standard proccedures like check in etc. *Safety, as there is 24hours guard for the whole complex and moreover the elevators are working only with card rooms - by the way i felt very safe in hong kong, there wasn't even the need to keep an eye for scams or something.. *Fantastic rooms - exactly as they look in their official site's photos! Big and VERY clean. Workstation with all the types of plugs (!), high speed internet (included / free). Big closets with enough space. Safety Box. Light control for the whole room near the bed. *VERY good sleep quality as the big bed, the matresses and the linens are high quality! These plus the variety of pillows means the you'll sleep great - which for me is the most important in a hotel. *Big bathroom with both options (!) a big modern shower and a bathtub. Very good quality and \"fluffy\" towels. *Every day room cleaning (sometimes twice a day). Small chocolates that you'll find nearby your bed after that plus two (or sometimes even 3 or 4 ) bottles of water - remember they are trying to do their best. *Whatever you ask for, after 2 mins there is a smiley trainee in front of your door ready to bring it to you! * Breakfast with great variety and quality. The view is awesome in the breakfast area! * Well equiped gym with treadmils and machines.It has towels and it's spacy and new! The not so good news: * It's location requires the use of a taxi for the Hong Kong center (10-15mins ride - about 5-7euros / 7-10US$) or a bus (30 mins total for waiting and transportation 1,1euro or 1,5$). All in all i totally recommend this hotel, you can save much money while enjoying the welcome feeling that you get all the time. Don't forget to get the bus A10 from the airport which will cost you only 4euros/6US$, 45mins ride. I forgot to take the bus (every 30') though it was very easy to go to the bus station and i took a taxi so i paid 430HKD, which is about 40euros or 55US$. Wasn't worth it for this one. Good luck in whatever you'll choose to do and have a great time in Hong Kong ! :o) Thanks for reading my review.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "brisbane", "Title": "\u201cA special place\u201d", "Author": "BrisbaneBonnie", "ReviewID": "UR119217878", "Content": "We are at the T Hotel now and we are enjoying it throughly.

There is a bus stop in front of the hotel and It only take 20-30mins to reach Central or Mongkok. A cab ride to Peak tram will cost around HK$70. Don't be put off by the outside appearance of the hotel, T-Hotel is actually a very chic and modern hotel run by Vocational Training College of Hong Kong. The hotel rooms, restaurant, gym and business centre are all located on the 6th floor of VTC. As T-hotel is run by trainees in the college, check-in/ check-out might take around 15-20 mins but the trainees show very good effort and enthusiasm to help you with the luggage and show you around the room - which is very rare. The size of the room is big if you compare it with a 4/5-star hotel in Hong Kong. Room is chic and modern, bed super comfortable and bed sheets are very clean - not even a single stain! There is a walk in shower and a bath with TV in the bathroom and the hotel provides you with loads of toiletries - there is even a bath scrub provided. The mini-bar is very well stock and a can of coke cost only HK$6! Complimentary wifi is provided by the hotel. What I like most is the attentiveness provided by T-hotel.

My friend said that the hotel was actually trainee operated so with this in mind, my partner and I decided to take a tour of the property (in case it wasn't for us). Tours of the property are readily available and after one lunch at the Chinese restaurant on the premises, we decided to participate in the tour. It was fairly quick and brief but it was enough to see the main facilities in the property which were the executive lounge, two room types, gym and business centre. We were told on the tour that the property is a training facility and that it is operated mainly by students with little supervision. Why I have to state this is because if you plan on staying, I think it's best you know (and I will explain later the repercussions of having students organize and prepare everything). My partner and I decided to take the plunge and give it a try and since the room rates were more than reasonable (HKD $550 for a Saturday night in an Ocean View Room including buffet breakfast for two!) we thought we had nothing to lose. We arrived on the following Saturday and was delighted to be greeted by the trainees in a loud and clear manner. We were rather impressed at the professionalism however it may be deemed slightly intimidating as there were 5 student porters on each side of the front door and as you walk in, they all greet you in unison. The room was absolutely stunning! Complete views of South China Sea, television in the bathroom, large soft king size bed; I was truly impressed. I guess you could say that I was slightly iffy about the place because of the fact it is a \u2018training\u2019 hotel but the room itself was really good. It was also good because it was around 4PM so the sun was still up and we were able to see the sunset. I guess the main issues with it being a \u2018training\u2019 facility is that there tends to be an abundance of students, very willingly of course to assist you but it tends to be overwhelming from time to time. For example, during my buffet breakfast we were served by 4 students which is nice but for me was a tad too much because I am not much of a morning person. Another issue is that the security to the building is rather tight. I decided to venture out at night and came back to be questioned by the security twice if I was a guest at the hotel and one of the guards even followed me until he saw me walk through the lobby. Not saying that there was anything wrong with the safety but I felt a little bit of pressure. Overall, I would say to give it a try. I understand that they are in a soft opening period at the moment so there are still many things that need to be tweaked but it was a lovely experience and it was fantastic to enjoy a decently made coffee in Hong Kong whilst looking over the ocean. It\u2019s worth trying out because at the end of the day, it was definitely value for money, the service is pleasant, the room is gorgeous (I must reiterate this!) and the coffee is fantastic! (In comparison to all the other coffee places I\u2019ve tried in HK!) I hope this helps!
