It is not near much of anything within walking distance. There are two restaurants on location, one is open for breakfast and dinner, the other is open for lunch. The Green Igauana Bar and Grill has a very limited lunch menu of non-Puerto Rican (though Mexican) selections. We had burritios, a chicken salad, and tacos. The burritos were good in quantity and flavor, the tacos and chicken salad were adequate. Plan plenty of time if you eat breakfast at the Starfish restaurant, it is very slow, though nice staff. It was so slow the last morning I timed it. After being seated it took almost 9 minutes to get menus, then almost 34 minutes after ordering to receive food. We ended up renting a car from Avis which will pick you up and drop you off here at the Fajardo Inn. The Avis office experience was superior. Although the Fajardo Inn website lists \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Concierge Services\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it is not what you might expect. There is no specific \u00e2\u20ac\u0153desk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it is just the hotel front desk handling you along with all the other guest needs. The brochures offered are limited. Their primary recommendation is to rent a car and do the reservations for any tours on your own. Not all the recommendations we received from the front desk were good advice, so make a lot of phone calls to assure any and all reservations for any type of tours. The staff is certainly friendly and helpful, it is just the structure and procedures of the hotel management that seem difficult. For instance, if you want a hair dryer, you must go to the front desk, sign for it and then take it to your room. If you want a pool towel, then you must sign a liability waiver and get a pool towel card. To get a pool towel you do not go to the pool, nor to the front desk, you get pool towels from the Juice Bar at the gym, located quite some distance from the pool. There is a microwave, minifrig and coffee pot in the rooms. For coffee you must go to the front desk and purchase it, or drive to a local grocery store to get coffee and genuine milk or cream. Room maid service did not occur the first day, nor the second day. We were at the hotel for five nights. The first day, in late afternoon, we asked for maid service and just received a couple new towels. The second day for maid service, we called at 3:30pm and received nothing after half an hour. We called again and received maid service a half hour later. This was full maid service except for the coffee pot not being cleaned. The next two days we did receive good maid service. The rooms are spacious, quite spacious, and bathrooms are large with two sinks in the vanity area, along with plenty of shelf space at the sinks and in the bathroom. Hot water and water pressure was great. For charging up electronics there were plenty of outlets as this is a fairly new hotel, there is plenty of parking, two nice swimming pools, a mini-golf course, and the rooms have balconies with nice views. You are a long ways from the water and beaches so, again, you will want to have a car. They do arrange at-cost transportation for you to and from the hotel from the San Juan area. This worked out well for us and was good transportation. However, we now realize the correct way to stay at this hotel is to arrive and depart with your own transportation. For the price this is a very reasonable place to stay.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for a good price\u201d", "Author": "Houndlab", "ReviewID": "UR127217758", "Content": "The Fajardo Inn was a pleasant surprise in this neighborhood of Fajardo.

They have two pools, one by the hotel, the other by the fun park. The only down to the fun park is that it closes to early in the night.

The kids went into the smaller pool while we waited for lunch at the blue iguana. We were close to El Yungue (a good 1/2 day hike, the snorkeling on the Traveler and the Bio Bay Tour. Excellent gym.

You get passes for the pool and have to exchange for towels. Shouldn't be a big deal but OF you lose one it cost $25.00. Restaurants on site were $$ for what you got. We ended up driving every day to the Golden Sweet Bakery, about 1.5 miles downhill for breakfast. Cheap food but no fresh fruit or yogurt so eggs and pastries but great hot coffee.

Check-in with \"Nancy\" was great. We didn't understand the late 4PM check-in as the place seemed rather empty. But they \"just happened to have a room that we could have earlier...\" Yes a room with an awful view (we'd emailed ahead stating that we were on our 10yr anniversary...which went unanswered and obviously ignored). We looked onto a building roof and a cement yard with 5 broken down and rusty army jeeps (!). If you get a room number from 310-319 or 320-327 (above ours) or 300-309 (UNDER ours) on the cement yard (we felt for those guests!), don't accept it. Nancy mentioned our \"Expedia\" booking a few times (we booked through Hotels.com) and we wondered later if that downgraded our guest status?? I reported all of this to Hotels.com too and told them all about our experience(s) here. This hotel needs to update its TV's, and get wireless internet for entire complex. (It was only available near Reception and only with a code they had to give you...) The room was OK. The TV was an old tube TV with 1-2 channels. Remote did not work and when I called reception who said they'd send a new one: it never arrived...The bed was realllllllly great and comfortable and BIG. And although there was daily housekeeping, the floor of our room turned our feet black (seen by our footprints after showering on white bathmat). The first night, I hardly slept as the fridge sounded like a jet engine. When I fell asleep finally, although I had deliberately put out a \"Do Not Disturb\" thing on our door, we were CALLED on the room telephone at 8AM (!) to see if we wanted housekeeping???!!!!!! I was so annoyed. When we went to reception to complain about the room and enclosed \"jet engine\" and to request a new room, \"Nancy\" suddenly was not so pleasant anymore. Ignoring our room change request, she merely stated (dismissively) that she would have the fridge changed. I mean, the fridge changed out???? It was not like the Inn was full.. Needless to say there was no fridge change... On the third afternoon, after being poolside, we were in the room and then heard a struggle to get our door open. Reception had given new guests our room# when they should actually be checking into the room next to ours. By now we were just like, seriously? On a positive note, the pool areas were great. The grounds themselves are pretty nice (aside from the incarcerated tropical birds near the bigger pool area).. The bad rooms are clearly reserved for Expedia/Hotels.com) i.e budget travellers. The drinks at the Blue Iguana were huge and cheap. The poolside bar was never open except \"Family Day\" on Saturday, March 26th which had been advertised to the public so all could come in upon paying an admission fee!! YUCK - strangers with the guests! We made sure we were out all day & only went to get a glimpse of this fiasco at the end of our day. Fiasco is one way of putting what we saw. It was also clear on weekends that they were additionally upping their revenue by doing weddings. The area was great though in terms of travelling etc. el Yunque was close. Luquillo too....at Monserrate Beach, where all the kioskos lline the roadside, we ate at #49 and met Saul. Great guy who said he actually lived in Fajardo ...Beach was completely covered in litter and trash cans full and covered by small white egrets rummaging through the garbage. We'd definitely return to PR. The people were so friendly and nice and we felt safe, most importantly. We've been attacked 3 years ago in St. Maarten (near our accomodation at La Caravelle on the French side) so SAFETY is quite important to us. That island was awful incidently. Anyway... We went over to the el Conquistador one evening to see what all the hype was about. It was awful. Huge. Tacky. And after we spent $10 in the casino, we decided to NOT have drinks and leave. You also have to pay parking while there!!!! L'Estacion Restaurant nearby was very good. But L'ole ola a little further down the road was FANTASTIC. Jose behind the small bar made our night. Pason Restaurant/Bistro (also on the same road) was not worth it at all. Overpriced and overrated. Best afternoon Beach/Eat spot: \"Costa Mia\" in Los Croabas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The best part about this hotel is the price when compared to the resorts nearby. The hotel is a good value and a decent place to stay but has the potential to be great with some attention to detail and a few upgrades. We stayed in a room with a comfortable king-size bed and a kitchenette. The room was very clean, and housekeeping came daily. The view was horrible -- we looked out at a parking lot, roof of another building, and unfinished construction. The kitchenette appliances were worn & old but seemed clean. Like other reviews, our pillows were flat & lumpy but we didn't ask for new ones, so I don't know how management would have responded. The pool area is beautiful, but the swim-up bar was closed and we learned that it rarely opens - very disappointing! We ate a few times at the Blue Iguana bar & grill and the food/drinks/service were all good. They have a new chef or chef manager who seems to be working hard to improve the food, etc. We had no problems with speed of service at the Blue Iguana - everyone was very responsive. The neighborhood looks rough, but seemed perfectly safe - it's true, non-touristy Puerto Rico. Close to the ferry, which is nice if you're heading to Culebra or Vieques for the day. Just be sure to get to the ferry early to get in line for tickets! Also close to El Yunque and Luquillo, which is a nice perk.

If you come to this side of the Island don't plan on walking, (there's not much for sidewalks) Cabs will take you where you need to go, but its spendy.

(a cab is 180.00) its about an hour away from San Juan. When you and if you decide to book it, expect GREAT customer service at the front desk, everyone went out of their way to book us our catamaran and snorkeling tour, they called pizza places for specials for us (I'm not fluent in Spanish at all!) They seriously go out of their way to make sure you have a good time or at least understand whats going on. The beds are very comfortable, (ask for a couple more pillows tho) TV is a bit small BUT it has cartoon network, nick, usa, tbs, fox (spanish) and about 20 other channels. No refrigerator or microwave, there are washer and dryers tho, 1.50 each. Quiet neighborhood, for as bad as it looks around the Fajardo Inn, its a quiet neighborhood. Keep in mind PR has a 16.5% un employment rate and with such nice weather (82 during the day and 76 at night) I don't think I'd move much either, however...you can't be that lazy not to pick up trash and maybe make the town look nicer, A LOT nicer. A lot of factories have pulled steaks and moved on and left behind a LOT of trash! If you've ever been to Tijuana you're on the right track. The Fajardo Inn IS NICE, and about one of the nicest in town that I COULD AFFORD. Two good size pools, the smaller one is closer to the hotel. The larger one you'll see in the pics. They're NOT heated, but don't really need to be either. The larger one does have a swim up to bar but its not manned. (can't blame them though, after all they're not that busy during the week) Very clean hotel, Very friendly, GET A C A R!! No stores around, NO restaurants except the two with the hotel. The Mexican one down stairs is ok, GOOD customer service. Don't know about the upstairs restaurant... its open at limited times. GET A CAR!! Check out the bird Avery down by the 2nd pool. VERY NICE weight and cardio room. Miniature golf is there too and its FREE! Did I mention to get a car? If it wasn't for the customer service and good up keep of the Fajardo Inn I'd never go back to PR. BUT I'd go back to Fajardo Inn with NO reservations.

Internet access was limited to a room that remained locked all day. Surprisingly, the grounds were well maintained with nice gardens and pools. The restaurants served a variety of good foods at reasonable prices, but the service was unbelievably slow (45 min or more to be served breakfast). Finally, We had read that there were *some*ocean views and that the ferry was an easy walk.

Our first mistake was ordering Mexican food in PR. It was by far the most disgusting food we have attempted to eat, however that complaint was kept to ourselves. The bed was the most uncomfortable bed imaginable. We did not sleep our entire stay. The mattress was like an abyss, lumpy and saggy, but again we did not complain. We did not venture out for food our third and final night and decided to eat at the Starfish (the hotels second restuarant). We waited for an hour for our appetizer. We even cracked a joke to each other, that the chef must have left to take a break, after making the handful of other patrons food. A minute later we watched the chef walk in from outside somewhere. We decide to leave. Other diners told us on their way out that it took them 45 minutes for there food. I call the waitress over for our check for the two glasses of wine we ordered... 15 minutes later, we GOT UP to see what we owe for the wine so we can go elsewhere to eat, and the waitress cannot tell us the cost of the wine, that her manager was elsewhere and would be up shortly to cancel the transaction. Finally we told her that we were in room 208 and we could be found there for the cost of the wine. On our way out of the hotel, we decided that we had enough of the poor service we recieved and stopped by the front desk. The manager finally strolled in to tell us that our wine was taken care of.

I am sure the sheets were clean, but as I said, they could use a bit of practice. Lastly, there were some tiny ants running on the hard floor in the room. They did not bite and they weren't really a bother, and I do realize that it's the tropics...but we had bought some pastries at a local bakery, and the ants truly seemed to enjoy them. The moral here is just to put food into zippie bags. If you can, bring your own pillow. The mattress wasn't good, but wasn't too bad. But the pillows were terrible. There was free wi-fi service, but the connection out to the internet was down when we were there. Not a big deal - I only wanted it to check in for our flight, which I ended up doing on my phone. But if internet is a big deal, keep this in mind. There are two restaurants on site. The grill was pretty good, and the prices were great! The more formal restaurant was not so good, and was quite expensive. Hours here for the restaurants can be quite flexible (\"closes at 10\" can mean anything from 8 - 11).

So, I go to the front desk to get a new key, go to my new room and get into the room, if you like Motel 6, or older Best Westerns, this is the hotel for you....tiny TV, A/C that I had to call down to ask someone how to use, hard tile floors, clock which had the wrong time, very old looking room and furniture. However, the bed was comfortable for me....I did ask for a wake-up call, it did not happen, lucky for me I keep my own alarm for travel... Note, I did try to purchase water when I came in but there was none left in their machine and the front desk suggested I take a 5 minute walk (at midnight) to the other machine, there may be water there, hah, hah. I read a review that someone else wrote that their food in the restaurant was expensive, I would not mind paying the outrageous rates if they had such things as skim milk or even low fat milk, but the choices that they carry is not what a business traveler is used to.

It was kind of hard to find because their address did not come up on the GPS, and they did not have directions on their website. We stayed in room 214. It was fine, although the first day we noticed ants on the floor. We stayed three nights. On the first day we were gone all day and came back and our room had not been cleaned. Just after 4pm when we arrived back, a housekeeper came by and asked if we wanted the room cleaned. we had been hiking all day and just wanted to nap, so I sent her away, but it was pretty annoying that the room was not cleaned before 4pm when we returned. The room was cleaned on the 2nd day. They gym is great! We tried to get towels to use to pool but they were out, so we had to go spend $30 at Walgreens on beach towels. Neither the pool nor the front desk had clean towels for us to use. The Mexican restaurant on site was ok. The guidebooks say it's great and that locals come from nearby to eat there, but it was kind of bland and definitely not authentic Mexican. The margaritas were very sugary. We also attempted to try the seafood restaurant on site. We were seated around 8pm and wait for about 20 minutes for someone to take our order. In addition, our order was taken AFTER a couple that arrived AFTER us. We both wanted the sancocho, but they were out of that. My husband wanted one of their pork entrees, but they were also out of that. At that point we decided to leave. We did drive two minutes down the road to Rosa's Seafood, which was AWESOME. We had a great waitress and the food was great and we were taken care of right away. If you stay at Fajardo Inn, you should definitely venture our and go to Rosa's, and NOT eat at the onsite restaurants. There is also a chain restaurant in Fajardo called Pollo Tropical which is very good. Fajardo also has lots of grocery stores which we found to be helpful for cutting costs. We bought breakfast food and ate in our rooms instead of eating out and bought wine/alcohol there to further cut costs. The beach at Luquillo is a must. We spent the day and rented two lounge chairs and an umbrella for $20. There are seafood kiosks and drinks nearby and they are inexpensive. The parking was $3 and a bracelet to use the bathroom all day was $1 per person.

We had no complaints--this more than met our needs for a lazy late afternoon after a long day and before an early morning--but I probably wouldn't plan an extended stay here. Our room was pleasant, and the balcony offered a nice view, but as other reviewers have noted, it's small (maybe 3'x5'?) with no furniture--the kind of place you can stand with one or at most two other people, check out the weather or enjoy the view for 3 or 4 minutes, and return inside. Our king-sized bed was like those in all the other Puerto Rican hotels we stayed at that weren't part of major chains--it wasn't uncomfortable, but it was too soft by most US standards, so while I slept well, I woke up with a stiff back. The room was cheerful, not huge but larger than I expected, with a nice bathroom and spacious shower with adequate water pressure. If you don't usually travel with shampoo, be forewarned that the toiletries included within our room were just soap, bodywash, and body lotion. The staff at the main office was very friendly and helpful. Check-in is at 4pm, but we arrived in town around 2pm and stopped by, hoping we'd be able to at least drop off our luggage before driving around town or heading to the beach. Not only did they allow us to drop off our luggage and do all the check-in except actually get the room key, but we were welcomed to use the facilities: two pools (a smallish one, frequented by adults; and a very large one with a large slide, water games, an area that looked like a 25m-or-close-to-it pool, suitable for laps, as well as what looked like a pool restaurant-bar, though it was unstaffed and unstocked when we were there); a minigolf course; tennis and basketball courts; a large gym with quite a bit of nautilus/weight/exercise equipment; a juice bar; a hair salon; and 2 restaurants (though neither were open in the middle of the day, I don't think). We could stop in and give our names even before we had a room number to give and pick up pool/beach towels, and the pools and gym were free; minigolf was $2/person; I'm not sure about the tennis and basketball. Overall, the room, the grounds and the facilities were much nicer than I had anticipated. We ate dinner and breakfast at Starfish. The dinner menu included several Caribbean options as well as some salmon and other non-local dishes; the breakfast menu was very American. Both meals were pretty good. There's also a Mexican restaurant at the hotel. Hotel negatives: our AC worked, but just barely. It wasn't so hot that we felt like calling maintenance, but if it had been just 5 degrees warmer, this would have been an annoyance. No breakfast included with stay, though the Starfish restaurant on site serves breakfast (eggs or pancakes or french toast plus coffee, juice, bacon or sausage, was about $9; there were cheaper options available). No internet access in the rooms; there's a \"business center\" with one computer and a sign instructing you to contact the front desk for internet access--we didn't bother, but I'm assuming it's not free or cheap. Location negatives: This place sort of has the feeling of an aspiring all-inclusive resort, except it most obviously doesn't include the beach. The view if you look out toward the ocean is nice, but if you look straight down at the neighborhood you've passed through on your way to the hotel that sits atop a little hill a few miles inland, there are some industrial buildings and working class neighborhoods and a not particularly picturesque commercial district. The beach is at least a 5-minute drive away, maybe a bit more (we didn't drive directly). Perhaps families with young children would find this resort largely adequate to entertain them for a short vacation, and it would definitely be more affordable than most resorts, but most visitors would probably want to leave and head out elsewhere--the beaches, parks, biobays, etc., which means you'd probably want to rent a car, and you'd need to make arrangements for biobay tours and do other stuff that would be taken care of for you at the larger resorts this place mimics. I'd recommend this place for people spending one or two nights in Fajardo before or after taking the ferry or flight to Vieques or Culebra or for others stopping briefly in the area. I think it would be an easy place to entertain young children, too. But if you're looking for a home base for a week at the beaches in the region, you'd probably prefer a hotel that's actually nearer the beach.", "Date": "December 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "gatesnyc", "Title": "\u201cExceeded expectations\u201d", "Author": "gatesnyc", "ReviewID": "UR22927376", "Content": "My husband and I stayed for 4 nights.

As we where a bit tired the first night we went to the more expensive restaurant in the hotel grounds, it was ok, but you can find better food for the same price or less outside (Pasion por el Fogon, Calizo, and a restaurant by the Bioluminescent Bay, etc) I also stayed in Passion Fruit bed and breakfast. Passion Fruit was great as well and the service and attention was better and more intimate than Fajardo Inn. Breakfast was very good and the place was very clean. Passion Fruit was a bit nosier in terms of people coming in/out of rooms and all the AC units running created a lot of noise. These are two distinct logging options so comparing them is a bit unfair and it depends if you like a Bed and Breakfast vs. Hotel/Resort accommodations. I will probably not go back to Passion Fruit, depends on the price, etc. I only saved a few dollars in Fajardo Inn vs Passion Fruit, so I think Fajardo Inn is a better bang for the buck. On Fajardo Inn - Negative - 1. We stayed in the 1st floor room and the window overlooks a large common terrace, so not much privacy unless you close the curtains. 2. The AC drip caused noise on night #1, as it was hitting the exterior of our room AC. We complained and told them to put a towel out to absorb the noise and the problem was resolved. Positive - 1.

We had some problems with the door key, but someone came by to fix this issue. The floors are tile and the bathroom is dark with a large tub. It's not hugely luxurious, but clean and sufficient. The kitchen area was a huge plus, since we didn't want to eat out in Fajardo (options were limited) and we certainly didn't want to rely on eating at the on-site restaurants 3x a day. The living area was also decent, however don't expect luxury linens. The grounds were kept up, but there is a lot of construction going on. Also, note that the pool area with mini-golf and tennis courts is open to the public. I did have a good time there for a few days, but as I was on my babymoon, it simply wasn't romantic enough. We checked out a day early when a full bus of local teenagers showed up at the open pool and they started blasting reggaeton. We went to the reception area and booked a room at el convento in old san juan and handed in our keys. All in all, this is a wonderful place in a not-so-amazing area IF you have kids with you. I really wouldn't recommend staying here for romance. After years of trips to mexico, the local beaches just don't compare. I'm sure the surrounding islands are great, but we stood in line for an hour in the morning to get on a ferry. A half hour before departure, they said the tickets had been all sold... and the line had never even moved.

Good-sized room, well-kept property. Convenient to Seven Seas beach and highway 3 to get to El Yunque/any points south. Cons: I'm generally not a picky hotel customer, but for the price, there were several small problems that I might have ignored had the hotel been cheaper. Doors to the outside were left open at all hours of the day, and cleaning staff left the room doors open while cleaning -- this resulted in an army of mosquitos in the room each night, and fresh bites each morning. Bathroom had a slight smell, maybe mold. The door/lock was smaller than the frame, which led to a banging sound all night long as the door rattled with the breeze -- to accompany the knocking sound in the a/c. Two days into the trip our cards randomly did not work for the room, although the desk was quick to replace them. In an effort to tidy up the room, the housekeeping staff occasionally stuck things in random drawers/out of sight, which meant some hunting around to find things. All in all, as a bargain traveler, I might look for a cheaper hotel next time instead of paying for the nice facilities, which we rarely used (there's too much else to do!). If you're looking for a more relaxed vacation where you plan to spend a bulk of your time at the hotel, or for an extended business stay, this is probably a suitable place.", "Date": "June 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa,FL", "Title": "\u201cBeware!!\u201d", "Author": "TampaJay", "ReviewID": "UR16825162", "Content": "Nice looking hotel, the front desk staff were very nice, I did encounter a real problem with the Mexican restaurant/Bar downstairs, I had to wait 20 min to have someone get me a table..even though the place was empty...another 20 to get the waitress to get my order.

Beds were very comfortable, our room had satellite t.v, air conditioning, and full shower/bathroom. Second, the newly rennovated pool/bar was perfect for lounging and sun bathing.

Also, Protein Smoothies/Drinks are available at the Juice Bar : Highly Recommended! Finally, the staff was amazing, everyone from maids to servers were very nice and very friendly. The staff was extremely helpful in showing us nearby tourist attractions.

If it is from a recent visit, (first weekend in April) I might have been there at the same time. Doesn't even seem like the same place! First of all, the staff was amazing. Everyone did everything possible to make this a great stay. From providing maps, directions, food tips, etc. I found each and every staff member to be top of the line. The manager...I think her name was MarieLynn or something like that-- was particularly kind to my family. I was with my elderly mother and sister and she came and sat and talked with us all about Fajardo and gave us some interesting details of life in Puerto Rico. Cleanliness: top notch. We had a triple room-three double beds-which is a first for us. The room was immaculate. The floor was stone tiles and and the housekeeper mopped the floors every day. The hallways were also mopped daily. I was particularly surprised one night to leave the room around 9 PM and a housekeeper was quietly polishing all of the furniture in the parlor. Sheets were changed daily which has not been the case in many hotels I have visited recently. Food: okay, the Starfish restaurant on the premises was not that great. My mother had fried shrimp which was entirely overcooked. BUT....when we told the waiter he not only brought her a new order, he did not charge for the wine my sister and I were enjoying. The Mexican restaurant on site was really good. And once again, I must disagree with a previous reviewer. We found the prices to be extremely reasonable. Large chicken nacho platter WITH two sodas came to about $7.00. I have paid double that for the platter alone. There are several small places on the road to the Inn which are quite good. The pools are beautiful. Very quiet. If you want the cabana guys and pina coladas delivered poolside, this is not the place. It's the place to read a book. We didn't even see \"Coco's park\" until the second day. What a place for kids! Miniature golf, basketball, and incredible pools. We swam and sunbathed in the quiet pool right outside our room. (use lots of sunscreen..that sun is pretty intense). Anyway, our visit to the Fajardo Inn was a huge success. Again, I must issue one caveat. If you want action, noise, music, etc. this is not the place. It is a place to relax in a beautiful environment.

We were very pleasantly rewarded! We found the hotel very easy to find - followed the directions on the hotel website and got there on the first try! It was a great drive from the San Juan airport - very scenic. Our check in went smoothly and we were in our room in no time. The room was beautiful - tile floors, a wooden sleigh bed, beautiful tv console... The balcony was a little small, but easy for two to stand outside and gaze at the ocean in the distance. We had the door open alot in the daytime to let fresh air in. There were screens in the windows, so we had them open all the time, too. We wanted to get as much warm air as possible, coming from winter in PA! The in room safe was big enough for my husband's laptop (and still had more room). The bedding was comfy, and there was a coffeemaker and a refrigerator, so we bought our own water bottles and drinks... The bathroom was fantastic. There was no mold or mildew and everything was very updated and modern. The soaps even smelled awesome! The tiled shower was HUGE - no bathtub, though. Housekeeping kept the room very clean. The pool was amazing - all tile and looked like it was recently remodeled. Never anyone there during our stay. There was a section for laps, a section with a basketball hoop, a slide, and the zero entry point. A GREAT pool for all ages - lots of shallow water yet lots for adults too. Didn't do the mini golf but it looked nice - $2 extra to try it. Pool was open 8am to 9pm, and a smaller pool was open from 9am to 10pm. This smaller pool was closer to the hotel rooms and was also very beautiful. lots of changing rooms - we checked out then hung out by the pool because of our later flight. Staff was extremely nice and accomodating. Requests for extra towels were taken care of immediately. Hotel grounds were beautiful and very clean and well taken care of. Playground looked nice and aviary was cool, too. The only bad was the restaurants. We only ate at the mexican one and it was nothing special... beef was very chewy...overpriced... Don't waste your time eating there... breakfast and lunch? go the the Golden Bakery right down the street - less than half a mile before the hotel - great food!!! and cheap! and for a beach - go to seven seas beach about 10 minutes drive from the hotel. we went there three times and were always the only ones there. The water was clear and calm - nicer than the other beaches we went to like Luquillo. Go to Culebra and rent a jeep for $130 for the day and beach hop there!!! We went to Zoni - nice, but Flamenco was gorgeous! This hotel was great because of it's location - we always stay on the beach previously so it was a gamble for me, but i loved being close to the ferry - we were late one morning and drove there and parked and got on the ferry in 5 minutes! We were there for 5 nights and it was quiet the whole time - we seldom saw any other guests!

I like that location was situated right in the middle of town. It never felt unsafe and it was easy to get around (via taxi). Staff service was good. They were quick to jump on whatever we needed. It did feel a little dead which I thought was strange for March but then again, we stayed Sunday to Monday and Sunday is typically a very slow night in Puerto Rico. THINGS WE LOVED: *Great location *Very spacious, never crowded *Rooms were spotless *Several pools *The \"inn\" had a really nice humble and sincere vibe to it *Prompt service by the staff. Example: We asked for a cab, they called him immediately, he knew most of the staff on site so we felt comfortable with him taking us wherever, he took us to the restaurant and then returned to pick us up and bring us back (and didn't charge us until the cab back home), and gave us a small tour of the town on the way back. *A lot to do on the grounds *State of the art gym with top quality equipment *Great place to order smoothies by the gym *Good quality samples in the bathroom (shampoo, conditioner, lotion) *Coffee maker in room; good coffee to go with it *Great views from the balcony THINGS THAT COULD'VE BEEN BETTER: *The on site food restaurants. They were average at best. Venture out - much better in the area. NOTE: if you ask the staff, make sure you ask specifically for what you want in your dining experience. For example, we said we wanted great authentic quality food and we were sent to a restaurant in a sketchier part of town (Rosa's which was EXCELLENT) where you had to be buzzed in. Don't get me wrong - the food was great and we would go there again since we can adjust to anything and we didn't mind at all about the location, however, what we had in mind was more of a place for good scenery where we could lounge outdoors by the ocean, etc. *The pool bar was abandoned. What a waste of revenue opportunity! This place has so much potential. The pool bar was built in with a grill and NO ONE was working it. It was just abandoned and run down. How can the owner let something like that go to waste on a such gorgeous piece of land?! Alcohol & food are a huge source of revenue -and you'd think this would be OPEN and upkept. My first thought was, maybe their fridge or something is open - but then I thought, they should bring down a cooler and make some money or at least have a waiter/waitress from the bar nearby take drink/food orders.

I want to begin this review with the major issues we had, however. Our priorities were safety and ease of getting around since the Inn is tucked away from other tourist-type destinations. Please read on, though, to the positives of the Inn, if my stated concerns are not high on your personal priority list. I agree with previous reviews that state it is not in a good location. It sits near industrial sites and a run-down community. Traffic problems and poverty abound in the vicinity. Of course, this is not the inn's fault, but travelers should beware if these are the issues that concern them: First-Although we experienced no direct threats to our security, the grounds of Fajardo Inn are not gated and we saw no evidence of on-site security....? Secondary entrance doors were left standing open during the day. Second-Driving to and from the Inn was treacherous! Streets near the Inn were very rough, with large potholes and traffic was very congested at times. If you plan to drive around Fajardo and Puerto Rico at all, note that the driving of locals is very unpredictable and wreckless by U.S. standards. Rules at stop lights are disregarded (stopping seems to be more of a suggestion), drivers cut others off on the thoroughfares and at corners. They are impatient, regularly laying on the horn and waving their hands in the air at other drivers! On Sunday of our visit, there were many people riding horseback on the streets (during the day and in the dark), blocking traffic, darting across in front of automobiles (at one location, with the horses tied up, the people sat in the roadways in the dark. This made even the safest driving hazardous). At the major intersection nearest the Inn, a local was approaching the car and panhandling daily. The Inn itself is not a bad place, however. The facility itself was beautiful, with breath-taking views. The rooms were very clean and supplied daily (complimentary coffee,soaps, shampoo, conditioner, and lotion). The staff was friendly and accommodating. The pools were clean and inviting. The food at the Blue Iguana was good, while the Star Fish was fair. Service in both restaurants was average. *Beware, however, that we were consistently overcharged on meals, drinks, etc. When we pointed this out, the response was that the menu prices need updating. (This seemed to be a trend, as the same thing happened at the highly recommended Rosa's). We found that the local restaurants in general were overrated, lacking high quality service and/or pleasant \"fine\" dining atmosphere as ratings suggest. We came to believe that ratings were likely based on comparisions with other local establishments. We did not utilize the fitness facility, due to the fact there was an $5 fee for each session. On a final note, I read another reviewer's comment that plumbing was not functioning properly.

The hotel is in the coastal city of Fajardo. The best way to summarize this hotel is that it is nice, but needs to work on some details. The directions I was given were not that great and it was hard to find. The hotel is just off Route 195. Once you get off of Route 3 at the 195 exit, Route 195 breaks up after a short distance and the signage is not great in terms of helping you find where it picks up again. The hotel does look quite attractive from the outside. The parking at the hotel is a bit of a challenge since the road is narrow and part of it is on gravel. The hotel staff members at the registration desk were pleasant and gave me an electronic card key for my room. The elevator was out of service so I carried my bags upstairs. I later noticed a sign saying that baggage assistance was available, but the sign had been partially blocked by a plant. I left the hotel the next day at 8am. When I returned at 4:30pm, my room had not been made up. Ten minutes later, I heard a knock at the door and the maid wanted to make up my room. I asked why she hadn't serviced the room earlier and she said she had 30 rooms to cover. I declined the service since I didn't want to leave my room again. By the way, there is no peep hole in the door which is a security risk. In terms of the room, the bed was quite comfortable and the furnishings were nice. The lamps in the room had 3-way switches but the bulbs were the newer energy-efficient bulbs that didn't work well with the 3-way switches. The bathroom had some oddities. There is no hair dryer. Ordinarily I wouldn't care, but hair dryers were an advertised feature. Also, there is strangely no place to put your soap or shampoo when you are in the shower. I kept looking for a soap dish but could not find one. There were two bath towels, but only one washcloth. In terms of the hotel features, I wanted to use the pool but for some reason it closes at 7pm. This is way too early for a pool to close.

I read a review here that stated the Fajardo Inn is a 2 star hotel with a 5 star pool and that is just about right, only the 5 star pool has some major defects. Let's start with the pool. First, the whole property is very hilly and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone handicapped or who can't walk up steep inclines. The main pool is at the bottom of the hill, so a good walk from most rooms. Most of the pool is only 2 feet deep so you have to walk around 50 feet into the pool before you can actually swim. The swim up bar was not in service while we were there except to feed the 75-100 screaming camp kids that were there using the pool. There was also extrememly loud music blaring the whole time we were there. We had a so-called honeymoon suite, which was a slightly bigger room with a bigger bath with a jaquzzi, only, (major sin), the jaquzzi only holds 1 person-come on, in a honeymoon suite!!!??? Rooms are recently remodeled, but the workmanship is lousy. You could pass an envelope between the seems of the window in our bathroom out to the stairway- no caulk, no wonder so many complain about ants, although we didn't have any. Service throughout was poor, especially for a small hotel and workers simply went through the motions and weren't very friendly. The landscaping is lovely and the property could be a very good one, but the aforementioned \"sins\" of a small inn make dropping the big bucks on the Westin the best option in this area for a relaxing luxury stay. The Fajardo Inn is also a good 20 minute drive to the rain forest. In summary these are the cardinal sins- the best feature, the pool has glaring design defects and they have sold out to summer camps to make money, totally ruining the atmosphere for guests, service is poor and unfriendly, which is the chief sin for a small inn in my book. Landscaping is nice but it is very hilly and not for people who can't walk well. Rooms are remoldeled with poor craftsmanship and decor is well, let's say 4 dogs playing poker class of art, etc. Inn is too far from Rain forest and best beach (Loquillo) and in a dumpy neighborhood.

I will start with the bad. During this year I have stayed at this hotel twice and both of the times I have had a very unpleasent experience due to the hotel Manager and new hotel policies. The first time I stayed there were no double rooms available so we book a single for me and my family. When we went to use the pool only 2 people were allowed to use the pool and the additoinal person my 3 year would have to pay 21 dollars per day in order to use the facilities (mini golf, pool, ect) or I would have to book an additonal room and spend the night away from my family. So if you arrive let say at 6:00PM and the pool closes at 8:00PM you still have to pay 21 dollars for the use of the pool... $21 dollars for 2 hours is quite expensive plus $21 for every additonal day. As a consumer these rules are ridiculous. When talking to the hotel Manager the first words out of her mouth were NO you may not use the pool unless you pay the aditional fee weather its 2 hours or the full day you still have to pay for the 3rd person. In my opinion no minor child should have to pay an additonal $21 fee to use the pool especially a daily fee - one of the reasons for choosing this hotel was becaus our son loves the pool. On our second stay we stayed from Sat thru Mon. Sat and Sunday we went out on our boat so we did no use the ameneties. On monday we planed to spend the afternoon at the pool. Check out was at 11:00AM... so we Had breakfest at there restaurant and check out and planed to use the pool for the remaining of the afternoon because well we promised our 3 year old that we would take him to the pool. When we went to pool again we were told we could use the pool not because of the $21 fee but becuase you are no longer alowed to use the pool or any of the hotel amenities once you have check out or before you have checked in. Again we talked with the hotel Manager (VERY RUDE and UNPROFESIONAL LADY)... Her very first words were NO - NO you may not use the pool if you have check out of the hotel. My son bursted in tears... so did my wife becuase she would have to brake her promise to my son . We asked the hotel manager if she would make an exception for that day since we had promised our son we would take him to the pool. She saw him in tears and said absoultly not check out is at 11:00 AM and the use of our amenities after that time are stickly prohibited. Bare in mind, if you stay for one night and you plan to use the pool and lets say you arrive and 4:00PM (Check in Time) you may use the pool and hotel amenities from 4:00PM to 8:00AM on the arrival day and from 8:00AM to 11:00Am on the following day. Dont plan to stay the full day because they will literally kick you out of the hotel / pool and any other amenities they offer. It was very disapointing experience for me and my familiy and i will never use this hotel again unless these new policies are revised. Also, the hotel manager needs some people skills. The word NO should be in there vocabulary. Instead they should always try to find a way to please the customer. It's a shame becuase the hotel is quite cozy and has an execellent pool but the hotel management and new policies and rules can make your stay a very regretfull experience.

Because our flight got into San Juan too late to make the last ferry of the day, we decided to spend Friday night at The Fajardo Inn and head to Vieques the next morning. What a mistake. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re considering this, might I suggest you fly from either SJU, the smaller airport in San Juan (Isla Grande maybe?), or the airport in Fajardo and get to Vieques early! Between the hotel cost for the night and the taxi fare to Fajardo, you will end up spending about the same amount. The taxi cost us $60 to Fajardo and the flight to Vieques from Fajardo is $23 a person. Flights leave all the time. Regarding the hotel, I was really surprised after reading the reviews that it was as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153low-budget\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as it was. This hotel is not nice. I have stayed in hotel rooms for $50 that were nicer. The room was clean, however, the sheets and blankets were incredibly scratchy and thin and the bed was uncomfortable. They had placed a tiny television in a huge armoire. There were plastic slotted bars on the windows and they did not open. The air conditioner cover fell off. The bathroom reminded me very much of a hospital room bath, although not as nice. There was a metal door that led to a small balcony with no chairs. Our view, the only plus, was very nice. Please note, as other reviewers have said, there are no elevators in this hotel and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomplex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is built up a steep hill, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no easy access for handicapped or seniors. The facilities at the hotel are horrible. The putt-putt course was completely torn up and unusable. We played the first two holes and quit, even though we had paid to play. The holes were not marked with numbers or pars and they did not even have score cards. There were kids running everywhere playing on all the holes. The bugs were the worst part. They were absolutely awful, despite bug spray. After golf we made our way to the pool, which could be very nice if it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the bugs (we did not have this problem anywhere else in Puerto Rico-San Juan or Vieques). We stopped at the pool bar on our way to the pool and were surprised to see four employees talking at the bar, which we (rudely) found had no drinks or food. I wondered why they needed four people to staff it. When asked where we could get drinks, we were told to go up the hill to the other bar. When we arrived, it was also closed. An employee told us they only open it during the summer. At this point we were tired, hungry, and thirsty. We decided to head back to our room to change and go to the restaurant. They have an average Mexican restaurant on site that opens at 6:00, along with the other restaurant, which I believe is Creole (we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t visit). Our food was okay at the Mexican restaurant, although service was a bit more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclaid back\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 than we were used to. From what we could tell this hotel caters to mostly locals and is not anywhere nearly as average as it looks online. This is a wonderful example of a hotel with great potential that just does not measure up. Regarding the area around the hotel, I remember reading reviews that said there were restaurants close to the hotel. We saw nothing other than those on-site and would not have felt overly safe walking to anything outside the hotel anyway. In my opinion both Fajardo and the Fajardo Inn could have easily been skipped and our vacation would have been much better.

Culebra is beautiful. The water was crystal clear & the beach has white sand. The ferry ride there is a pain. Make sure you get tickets in advance & sit inside. The diesel fuel really smells. We ate at roadside vendors in Culebra & the main island which was cheap for us & good. We also went to a beach in Vega Baja which was really nice for little ones. It has a shallow area & several hut's where you can buy food & drinks. El Yunque is very nice. Although we only drove through it was beautiful. Old San Juan is very nice too. I love the shops & cobblestone streets. Overall the hotel was great for the price.

The ceilings in the room were acoustical tile ceilings which never allowed the room to cool down enough to remove the odor or the dampness which filled the room. The shower was dirty and there was no counter room in the bathroom to set any of our toiletries. The Hotel offered no ammenities at all. No inn room coffee makers, no coffee in the lobby in the AM etc.. the ice maker was broke, the business center that had access to internet was also out of working order. Which by the way is not free. It cost $ 5.35 to use the computer for 1/2 hr - when it is in service. The restaurant charged 9.00 for scrambled eggs, hardly a bargin for such a lowly rated resort. The room furnishings were okay, however they had a large resort vanity, but when we opened it there was a small 19\" TV inside it. We all thought this was quite odd looking. But at least they had a TV. The bedding, although damp, appeared clean. The comforter on one of the beds had what appeared to be a large burn hole in it, but they still used it. On a positive note, the pools were beautiful. However you had to climb a number of steep hills when you walked the grounds. I would not recommend the resort to older clients.

We had come from a week on the island of Vieques, which is quite rustic and rural. Staying at the Fajardo Inn was a nice change from the island. This hotel is not fancy, but absolutely adequate and comfortable. It is mostly a full-service hotel in that it has restaurants, two pools, putt-putt, playground, tennis courts and gym, etc. The rooms are actually nicer than the website photos depict. They have newer furniture and linens. There's a nice table and chairs in each room also. We stayed in a room with two queen sized beds and a fridge. Apparently not all the rooms have fridges, but if you request one, they can generally accomodate at no extra charge. The rooms were plenty spacious. We ate all our breakfasts in the room since we had bought cereal and milk and various other breakfast staples to store in our fridge. There are two restaurants: a mexican bar/grill and a fancier seafood-type restaurant that also serves breakfasts. We ate once in the hotel at the mexican bar/grill. The food was really not good. I had read previous reviews indicating this was the case but thought we would give it a try ourselves. The reviews were right. We never gave the fancier restaurant a try. There are plenty of places near the hotel to eat that are cheaper and tastier, from regular American fast food to locally owned restaurants. The bathrooms seemed to be the most basic part of the accomodations. There was no tub, only a full-size tiled shower. They did not provide any of the typical toiletries you normally get at a full-service hotel. You got a cheap little bar of soap each day and a shower gel dispenser in the shower. Bath towels were provided but no wash cloths...that was strange! Our room was in the original building, so the sink, shower, and fixtures seemed a bit dated. But there are two newer buildings with rooms I did not see that I bet have more updated facilities. There are two pools: the original rectangular pool right outside the main building and a much larger kid-friendly free-form pool a short distance down the hill on the property. The traditional rectangular pool was beautifully tiled and was set in a lovely area. Many adults hung out there who didn't want to be around a lot of kids. You could get a drink from the bar/grill restaurant at this pool also. The larger free-form pool down the way was outstanding. It was beautifully landscaped with palms and tropical plants. It had a \"beach\" entrance for toddlers in one area, a wonderful waterslide, a lap pool area, and a giant hot tub. The lounge chairs were exceptionally nice also. It was heaven to lollygag around the pool overlooking the hills and enjoy the constant tropical breeze. Just a few complaints: the hot tub was not being heated for whatever reason when we were there and the fantastic looking swim-up bar with built in stools in the water was not in operation. When we inquired about when the pool bar would be open, they said it is only open in the summer and during the x-mas season. We were there during spring break and it seemed a good time to have it open! It seemed a big waste. Also, you have to pay to play putt-putt and use the gym facilities and probably also to play tennis or basketball. These services are not included in your nightly rate. We played putt-putt one night. The course is enjoyable for kids, but nothing fancy for adults. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the Fajardo Inn. I cannot say enough about the wonderful pool area there. It really made our stay. One note about the local beaches: there are two within 15 minutes of the hotel...Luquillo Beach and Seven Seas beach. We did not go to Seven Seas. We spent about 10 minutes at Luquillo Beach and realized it was not worth our time. The pool back at the hotel was much nicer. Luquillo beach is extremely crowded with locals and tourists. The sand (what there is of it) literally looks like a construction site. It was practially mud. A child could hardly make a sand castle it was so hard and dirty. The water was murky and not pretty. I would tell you to stay far away from this beach. It costs $3 to go there and it's a disaster. Since we had just come from Vieques where we enjoyed some of the most beautfiul beaches in the world, we didn't feel the need to try to seek out another beach. We just enjoyed the hotel pool instead. My husband did pull a drive-by of Seven Seas beach and he said it didn't look like anything worth going to either. I've attached some pictures of the pool area at the hotel.

We knew it was not on the beach, so that wasn't a disappointment. The rates were good, and it seemed to be a good base of operations for us. The first impression was positive: The front desk staff was quite friendly, and our room was clean, quiet, spacious and comfortable, with nice heavy wood furniture. But it's a pain to lug heavy bags up the staircase; there is no elevator. And after a few hours, you start to notice that a lot of very basic things are missing. The bathrooms, for example, have no towel hooks or racks to hang wet towels, and there is only one tiny shelf on which to place toiletries. We also asked the front desk for a hair dryer but were told \"they are all out.\" Nor was there any sort of clock in our room. Another strange thing: We asked housekeeping for extra towels and washcloths, since we were two active women with many outings a day. We got the towels, but for the duration of our stay, the staff would only provide one single washcloth. I was forced to try to wash with a hand towel. That was ridiculous. To my mind, any decent property manager would spend the $30 or $40 per room to add these items, all of which should be considered even for a two-star property. If I were a manager and someone needed a hair dryer, I'd send them down to the nearest Walgreen's (a few minutes away) to buy one for $10. Failing to supply washcloths, clocks and the like is just lazy. (Speaking of Walgreen's ... this is THE place to go for cheap beach towels, bamboo beach mats, souvenir T-shirts and a good selection of post cards.) I agree with another reviewer who found the property oddly vacant. There seemed to be very few employees working, except for the overworked few at the front desk. The pool bar was never staffed, and the restaurants opened very late in the day. We didn't eat at either, partly for that reason. Also strangely empty were the ice machines and all of the vending machines. There was no bottled water, soda or snacks anywhere in sight. Again, these seems fairly basic. Why have machines if you aren't going to fill them? And ice?!? Come on. We weren't asking for a lot -- just the basics. We had a lot of questions for the front desk, such as directions to restaurants and how to arrange tours of the bioluminescent bay, and everyone who helped us there was knowledgeable and super-friendly. This staff is one of the best things about the hotel. But we found ourselves wondering why they didn't write up little sheets on the most common questions or post the information on their Web site. It would be a nice service for travelers and take some of the load off the overburdened desk staff. A few recommendations about the area: _The bioluminescent bay, accessible by tours that depart from Las Croabas, 15 mins from Fajardo, is a MUST-DO. Seeing the phytoplankton glow in the dark is absolutely amazing. But be warned: DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS UNLESS YOU ARE AN EXPERIENCED KAYAKER. Fighting the incoming tide and maneuvering in pitch-black darkness through a narrow channel lined with mangrove roots is very scary and challenging. It's not a tour for small children, first-time paddlers or those who frighten easily. However, there are only five places in the world you can see this rare spectacle, and it's worth the $45 to try. _The Caribbean National Forest at El Yunque is also a must-do. We hiked the moderately challenging Big Tree Trail for about 40 minutes to reach La Mina waterfall and had a wonderful afternoon. The falls were crowded, but the water was lovely and worth the walk. The hike back was easier, with less climbing. _The Golden Bagel, just down the hill and maybe a half-mile from the hotel lobby, is the best deal in town for breakfast. Killer bagels, French toast and coffee for rock-bottom prices. _If you are thinking of taking the ferry to Vieques or Culebra, BUY YOUR TICKETS IN ADVANCE. We didn't know this was an option or we would have done it. We planned to go to Culebra and arrived at the ferry terminal more than 90 minutes before the departure time to buy tickets. We stood in a line that never moved for more than an hour. Seriously. The same guy stood at the front of the line the entire time and never got sold a ticket. As it became apparent there was a problem, I went to the front of the line and discovered that the ferry was boarding all the people who had bought tickets in advance first. Then, if there was room, they would sell more tickets. We decided to jump out of line and buy tickets to Vieques instead, where we spent a nice quiet afternoon on the beach. You might also consider taking a 10-minute flight to either of these islands, which we were told will cost about $100 apiece but spare you the 60- or 90-minute ferry ride and the long waits to get aboard. Finally, if you go to Old San Juan, we strongly recommend you try Aguaviva Restaurant, where the food is to-die-for fresh. We loved the mahi and mango ceviche, the medium-rare tuna steak and the halibut. Do not miss the watermelon sangria. It's one of the best drinks we've ever had.

Once we did though, we were not dissapointed. We had booked one of the honeymoon suites ($135 per night) and it had a very nice view of the city, hills surrounding it and a bit of the water from our private balcony. The room was spacious, very nicely appointed, and the bed was firm and wonderful - the best we've slept in anywhere. It had a jacuzzi tub in the bathroom, which we never did use, wetbar, refrigerator and microwave. There were two pools and we spent quite a bit of time at the larger one. A little warning to those of you, like me, that seems to attract every biting insect within 20 miles, use a bug spray because I came home with over two dozen very itchy bites from the no-see-ums that hang around the pool. The water slide looked fun and I would've loved to go down it even though I'm a 50-something. We were surprised to find that the whirlpool was not a heated, but liked how it water-falled into the larger pool. The first night we had dinner at the Starfish. What a delight. We ordered the Puerto Rican sampler appetizer and enjoyed every one of the little deep-fried treats-the sauce that they served with it was the best we'd had in PR yet. My husband and I shared a Caeser salad with chicken and each ordered one of the pasta dishes and a side of rice and beans. Everything was prepared exceptionally well. We ordered chocolate cake to take back to the room for later and it was very decadent. Was that why I gained 8 lbs. in one week?! The next night we ate at the Blue Iguana at the hotel. Again, the meal was wonderful and priced reasonably. We loved the little \"gatos\" that roamed the property, especially the friendly little kitten that hangs around the lobby area looking for someone to play with (of course, many people happily obliged her).

The Room: We stayed in the main building; in the main building the rooms with the odd numbers overlook the town area. The rooms with the even numbers have the views of the ocean. Our room itself, which was had two queen beds was huge; it was about 15x20. I can say that it was quite nice to stay at a place that you actually had more than 6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the side of the bed and the wall. The room had an in-room safe, a small refrigerator, a table suitable for eating on or working. One thing that was missing in the room was a microwave. The furniture was nice and modern, the beds were mushy soft and the bedspreads were a little worn. The TV was fairly small at 17\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The bathroom was a little dated, and had a shower stall instead of a tub. Overall, the room was acceptable and a little better than what I had expected. One more thing; do not turn on the AC and then leave the room for several hours. The AC is powerful and our room was quite cold when we came back. Since there was no heat in our room, we had to open up the windows to let the heat in! The Hotel: The hotel had a small business center and wireless access. Unfortunately, wireless could not be reached from the room; one had to go onto the front porch or lobby to have access. Fortunately, there were several tables/chairs on the front porch, so one could work there. The hotel staff was very friendly. Be sure to ask them for a copy of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Que Pasa\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Places to Go\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. While I did not eat at the seafood restaurant at the hotel, it was a Mesones restaurant. Mesones is kind of like a seal of approval for restaurants serving authentic Puerto Rico Cuisine. The Mexican restaurant at the hotel was fairly inexpensive, but nothing to write home about. The hotel had two pools; the one by the hotel is a typical pool; the one over the hill (Coco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) is the one that you would expect to see at a resort. You need to check in at Coco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guest house to visit Coco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool. They will give you towels at the guest house for use in the pool area. Be warned that there are confusing signs about the pool hours. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure when the pool was actually closed. There were signs at the pools that said the pool was open till 6:00pm; others that said 7:00 pm and the note on the door in the hotel room said 8:00pm. There is also a nice gym (with free weights) on site as well as a place to play mini-golf, tennis, and basketball. Also, as others have noted the hotel is very easy to miss. If you go to the one-way loop by the docks, you went too far. There is a sign that says hotel as other posters noted, however it is about a 12\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdx18\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd blue sign and very easy to miss. In case you miss the turn, the sign in the other direction was partially obscured by vegetation. The road that the hotel is on is a fairly wide road. I would guess that it is about 30-40 feet wide. Where to Eat/Shop: There are several American fast food and family style chain restaurants on route 3 between route 194, including McDonalds, Wendy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Ponderosa and Sizzler. There is also a Wal-Mart, a few grocery stores, and a Walgreens in this area. Except for the Golden bagel and the restaurants at the hotel, there is very little commercial activity near the hotel, so I recommend renting a car to get around the area. Nearby Activities: If you drive down to the docks to take a ferry to Vieques of Culebra, there are gated lots that charge a parking fee of $3-5/day. The ferry docks are to the north. You can get the ferry for $2 per adult one-way. Purchase tickets across the street from the ferry dock. You do not want to take the ferry to these islands if there is a storm coming or if there are high winds as the water will be very choppy. Do not pick outside seats on the ferry unless you want to smell diesel exhaust for the one hour trip. The nearest beach to the hotel is the Seven Seas beach; it is quite easy to get to.

I think the price of the hotel is a bit high compared to others I could get in Puerto Rico for the same price. We spent a lot of time looking for this place, mainly due to bad directions we got from someone in San Juan. When we finally found it, it was very simple and easy to get to and from the hotel. There are a LOT of stairs here. If you're disabled, forget about it. They did have a few ramps going up, and I guess you could stay downstairs, but it would still be a very complicated journey to get to the front door. My mom and I are pretty active and packed light, so this wasn't a problem for us. There is no elevator, but the staff does offer help with your bags if you need it. The hotel had some lovely Christmas decorations, and the grounds are pretty nice. The girl working the front desk was not especially friendly, but she was efficient enough. The room itself was very plain, and when I went to turn on the air conditioner I found it surrounded by ants. I've never had bugs in any room I've ever stayed in (except the Penny Sleeper in Anaheim, which we left immediately), so that was a surprise and made me a little paranoid about climbing into bed that night when I returned and found them gone. There was also some kind of bug in the shower that never moved. We did have a great view of the water and El Yunque and listened to the coqui the whole night. We took the bio-bay tour with Yokahu Kayaks, and when we returned the Starfish restaurant had already closed, but we had planned to go to Blue Iguana anyway, which is open until 11. You have to pay for chips and salsa, which we did. They were good but not spectacular. I got the chicken taco combo, and my mom got quesadillas. Everything was delicious, but the beans were a little too Tex-Mex for my liking. For all this and free refills on the soda, it only cost $19, making this our cheapest meal after the Luquillo beach kiosks. Check-out was easy, and there turned out to not be any bugs in my bed. For the most part, I really did like the hotel, but I think certain staff members could use a little improvement, and the bug problem wasn't pleasant.

The hotel was pleasant enough at first, but then things got pretty bad. We had a room with 2 full size beds. After the first night, my husband was getting bitten by some sort of bug. I don't believe they were bed bugs. We spoke to housekeeping, and they said they would change the bedding & bedspread. This did not help. My husband asked to change rooms, and they wouldn't comply. They said they would change the mattress. This didn't happen. So after the 2nd night of being bitten up, we asked to change rooms again. The people at the front desk said they couldn't do this. It was only after we mentioned \"Trip Advisor\", they finally agreed to change our room. After that the bug bites stopped. The hotel is pleasant enough for the price but be advised there is alot of walking to be done. There are no elevators but is is only a 2 floor hotel. We were traveling with our young children, so if you forgot something in your room, it's up the steps. It's also a distance to the washer & dryer, and if you use the larger pool with the slide next to the mini golf course, it's another LONG walk and a full flight of stairs down to the pool.So if you have a problem with stairs or traveling with small children, you may want to think twice! The staff was very pleasant but we started off on the wrong foot. We ate breakfast out at several different bakeries. Most served some sort of egg sandwhich or french toast (for the kids).

The drinks are more than fairly priced and they aren't stingy with the liquor but they do caution about overindulging. Our two suites cost less than $150 per night and were located in a separate casita so it was like we had our own separate hideaway. The king-sized bed was comfortable but don't expect to see a lot of furniture in the room. It had a full kitchen and the bath was okay. The only problem we had was with ants (not unusual in the Caribbean and since we live in Florida something we are unfortunately used to). When I mentioned it to the front desk on the way back from breakfast to my room, she said she would have housekeeping get on it right away. She wasn't kidding - the housekeeping staff got to the room before I did and sprayed the place. Since my son had the upper room in the building and didn't have any ant problems I would recommend staying out of the lower level rooms if this is a problem. The Starfish restaurant was very nice and we ventured out to a few of the local places such as the Anchor Inn and the Conquista and had nice meals at both places. The hotel is very convenient to El Yunque and Luquillo Beach and if you forget something there is a Walmart in town.

The pool is fantastic and even though they had limited hours (6PM) we were never asked to leave after 6PM and in fact one evening we stayed till nearly 8PM with no problems.

We stayed four nights with my husband and two-year-old in one of the nicer rooms with a big king bed and a jacuzzi. So here's what's wonderful: Yes-- the POOLS. One has a great big shallow area for little guys, plus a bridge to wander under to a waterfall from the jacuzzi. It also has a second waterfall and a big concrete slide with water spilling down it for a QUICK ride! The second pool is a standard rectangle, but surrounded by palm trees where you can hear the coqui frogs singing at night. Very pretty. My instinct is the kids can use the big pool while adults use the little one. There's also a playground and mini-golf course, also both new. They looked top notch, but we didn't actually use them. It also appeard that they were building a basketball court. The restaurant on the top floor was nice enough, the waitresses are VERY friendly. We didn't try the mexican restaurant on the bottom floor because it was way too loud for my little guy. But there is a big screen tv and a pool table in there, along with a traditional bar. The room was nice. The bed very comfortable. To my standard, everything seemed quite clean. Now here's the weird: This place-- for its size-- seemed as empty as empty gets. A massive pool had only us in it most of the times we used it. On the occasions when other people were in it, it seemed like they were day groups-- they had on wrist bands. Also, even though we got a \"deluxe\" room, we got a $1.85 view. The layout of the place must be expanding because the deluxe room's balcony overlooked a parking lot and the top of their big convention hall. Ugly. To be fair, the view of the ocean and Vieques was just beyond the big convention hall, but you can tell they built first and thought about the layout later. It wouldn't have taken much to put the parking lot and convention hall behind the hotel building with the balconies. (Tip: If you're shooting for a view, get a room in-- I think-- the 300 series. The \"original\" building has wonderful views where you can't see the parking lot and rooftop.) Another weird thing? Owing to the emptiness, the bar at the center of the big pool was NEVER staffed. Seriously. My husband, son and I were the only people down there. Once there were some ladies from Georgia sunning themselves. They adopted a BYOB policy, even though there's a sign saying \"No outside food or drink.\" But what are you supposed to do if the bar isn't open? And yeah, the big pool hours suck. 10am to 6pm when we were there. You are supposed to check in at a little building and get towels before you go down, but again, the whole time we were there, the little building was only open twice. So we got towels and hung onto them and gave them back at the front desk when we left. Also regarding pool hours-- one night I really needed a break, so I called the front desk on a hunch and asked what time the small pool was open till. They said 10pm. I think the sign says 8pm. Anyway, it's worth asking if you want a peaceful evening swim. As for the big jacuzzi, odd again, it was beautiful, but not warm. In fact it was actually cooler than the rest of the pool. Lastly, there was a lot of construction/activity, but we didn't notice any particular noisiness. There's a new building going up, they're paving the basketball court and there was constantly new furniture being delivered to all the rooms. Considering how much work has happening, it was very inobtrusive. All in all, I think the place is great. It's like a hotel on the verge of being a resort but they just haven't hit it yet. My husband called it \"a ruin in progress.\" If they ever staff all their bars and facilities, word will get out and the prices will go up. Until then, you have the place all to yourself!! Last tip-- just past the restaurant on the second floor, there's a stairway leading up to an open-air dining/bar area. Again, never staffed and mostly empty. GORGEOUS views. Sunset!!

Having stayed in upscale hotels in San Juan and Dorado on previous visits to PR, we had decided to sample a simpler style of lodging. Puerto Rico really has enchanted us (married couple in 50s), and we felt that we should see if the magic held up without the four-star safety net. Our 3-day, 2-night stay in the Fajardo Inn in early February was definitely not long enough and we are eager to return. In fact, staying at the Caribe Hilton in San Juan for the next six nights, we drove to the Fajardo vicinity two more times! (That can take more than an hour each way.) Driving in from the airport, we had no problem finding the highway turn-off for the Inn and once we knew where it was, it was equally easy to find it at night. From previous reviews, we were a bit leery about reports of steep stairs and sparse rooms. But we unloaded the trunk of the rental car in the driveway, and by the time my husband returned from parking, the manager had carried our luggage up to our room via the beautiful sweeping staircase. And so it went. They knew us and looked out for us cheerfully. Service was impeccable, without the sometimes too-closeness of a B&B. THE ROOM. We stayed in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Standard room w/balcony\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the main building. There was a tiled floor, small refrigerator, phone, cable TV with stations from the States, a cafe table and two chairs, dresser drawers, two night tables, your regular sliding-door size closet and a roomy queen bed that allowed us to sleep like babies. The bathroom had a huge shower w/soap and shampoo supplied, and since we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect Egyptian cotton bath sheets at those prices, we were satisfied with what we got. The air conditioner was just fine. I would have liked at least one upholstered chair to sit in. My husband didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care. The small BALCONY immediately overlooked some parking spots, another low-rise Inn building and a variety of evergreens and palm trees. In the distance was a view of green hills and the town of Fajardo with El Yunque looming behind it. In the other direction was the not-so-far-off Atlantic with a view of Culebra Island and smaller cays. Not bad for $95/night. THE POOL AND GROUNDS. As a pool aficionado, I was pleased. Yes, the pictures of the larger pool complex look like a computer-drawing on their web site, but it really does look that way in person! The pool bar wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open on weekday afternoons, but the wonderful layout of the large pools, the beautiful landscaping, green hills and violet skies, and various birds, iguanas and some wandering, friendly cats and roosters kept us relaxed and entertained. The original pool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a nice-sized, deep rectangle in a courtyard aside the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also was surrounded by all kinds of palms and evergreens, and by extremely friendly guests, many of whom were return visitors. The pool towels, which you get from the front desk, were top of the line! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not hard to see why the Inn has received environmental awards because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so creatively landscaped. In the public areas and hallways, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pass a lot of original art, some folky, some not original, but all nicely and imaginatively framed. The colonial island architecture of the main building was welcoming. Everything was designed with an extra, caring touch. OTHER SERVICES. The service staff was terrific and there was always someone cleaning the public areas. When we called for extra towels and TP, room service came immediately. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a dial-up Internet connection for my laptop in the room. When I finally went to the front desk they said they only connect the phone if so requested, and when I complained that I had wasted precious time, they gave me a free (usually $5) half-hour stint in the two-computer high-speed Internet room. There is a laundry room for the guests. RESTAURANTS. For breakfast and dinner, the Star Fish restaurant was good but not memorable (our full-breakfast selections were about $8 each; dinner main courses, mid-teens). The Blue Iguana bar and grill (w/pool tables and a large screen TV for viewing sports) was generous for lunch and dinner with a wide variety of home-made Mexican food that hit the mark for about $7 and up. Wine and liquor was fairly priced. You could eat entirely on the ground for several days and be neither bored nor broke. ENVIRONS. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do best to get a rental car at the airport, because you will want to explore the surrounding area, including the nearby rainforest, sweeping Luquillo Beach, the bioluminescent waters, etc. Staying entirely on the Inn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premises, despite their two affordable and pleasant restaurants, might be just a bit too quiet for more than a few days. Since the Inn is NOT on the beach, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to drive there. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fun to explore the unpretentious restaurants down by the marina and along the main road to the Inn. At the turn-off from Highway 3 are several shopping centers, with fast food chains and a large Walgreens offering any drinks, snacks and sundries you might need. For some reason, I couldn't transmit photos w/this review, so just know that the Inn's website photos don't do it justice.

There are, however, many many other assests that make it worth staying at while in Fajardo. #1. The location is unbeatable if you are around town to visit El Yunque, Luquillo's beaches, or are going to Vieques/Culebra for a day or a weekend visit (it is minutes from the ferrY and the hotel provides a van for $3/person to take you there, so you don't have to mess with the taxis). #2. The rooms are large and the A.C. is great! There is also a small fridge in the room to keep your water cools, which is a nice plus. #3. The views from the Ocean View rooms w/ small balconies are very nice, particularly when you can turn your head to one side an see the blue/green ocean and turn your head the other and see the tremendous peaks of El Yunque's rainforest with clouds nesteled at the top. and.... #4. Last, but certainly not least, is the GREAT AND INCREDIBLE AND RATHER UNBELIEVABLE Margaritas at the Blue Iguana Restaurant on the property. My boyfriend and I are from Texas, so we've had some great margaritas in our lives.... but, let me tell you, these rival any I've had in Texas or Mexico, for that matter. The food (Crown Nachos w/ chicken and the Tortilla Soup) was great... but what truly stole the show was the Margaritas (and the Medalla beer- the local Puerto Rican beer- is also worth mentioning). All in all, the Fajardo Inn gets 2 thumbs up from us!!

I stayed there primarily to go to Luquillo Beach, to kayak through the mangove at night to the bioluminescent Laguna, to visit El Yunque and to eat at the seafood restaurants in the Las Croabas vicinity. We ate one breakfast and one dinner at the Starfish Restaurant which were good, but not exceptional. You can't compare it to the nearby resorts because it is a modest operation and you pay accordingly. The grounds are beautifully landscaped and tended. We did see two cats while there but were not bothered by them. And the bedsheets did pop off of the mattress. The room was very large and we turned off the airconditioning every night. It was always very pleasant returning there after the day's or evening's activities. If you want something that will entertain you day and night it is not the place to stay but if you want a very nice accomodation while pursuing interests in northeastern Puerto Rico I would highly recommend it", "Date": "March 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middle Island, Long Island, New York", "Title": "\u201cSuper Comfortable\u201d", "Author": "sambuca", "ReviewID": "UR3090046", "Content": "Love this hotel.

Please note that there is a small companion building with very spare basic rooms adjoining (the former hotel before they remodeled) called the Scenic Inn which cannot be recommended.

Iguana Bar/Mexican restaurant is terrific. the main hotel and hotel grounds are beautiful. the staff was generally very friendly. Bad: nothing to do! the hotel makes a zero effort in making the place lively. pool and restaurants/bar close TOO early. one, count it, ONE ice machine on the entire premises. NO telephones, clock radios or remote control for the TV, so forget a wake up call, listening to music and/or lying in bed watching tv. the Starfish restaurant (for seafood) is God awful. a little salt and pepper goes a loooooong way. carefull with the towels and room key! $50.00 replacement charge for EACH missing towel, $200.00 for losing the key! Holy S--T! and yes, they make you sign out for EVERYTHING! UGLY: cats! behind the scenic inn lies a cat burrow. we counted atleast 12. they tend to roam freely at night, and are always fighting. room had an ugly ceiling stain (water damage?) and the towel rack always fell off. no attempts from the hotel to remedy both. the awesome balcony of the scenic inn (if set-up properly) is nothing more than a mattress storage space. we found one in the hallway, just next to our door. it's as if they don't care or, its a result of poor hotel management. avoid room number 10 of the scenic inn. all the other rooms have coffee tables w/ chairs, tv stand/drawer combo and ample living space. number 10 looks like a converted closet. the poolside restrooms and main lobby restrooms could use something called a \"urinal scented cake\". cheap and effective. whoa. Summary: you get what you pay for folks! truthfully, i was pleased most of the time. my thing is this: if they have the resources to build a new and impressive pool, then surely they could address the other minor issues. if they got it together, they would be a force in the Fajardo area hotel wars. my experience aside, when in PR, just have FUN!", "Date": "December 14, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cexcellent\u201d", "Author": "adventure523", "ReviewID": "UR2525674", "Content": "A wonderful hotel!

The steak came rare and no flavor what so ever, the beans came in a cup that when I opened it had some weird bubbles on top, the salad the tomato and cucumbers,etc were sliced so thinly you could see right through it, the lemonade was good but the cup was so tiny. 20 minutes afterwards I felt so sick I had to lay down. The next day I said maybe I should try the other restaurant the Blue Iguana Mexican Bar and grill I had nachos with cheese,beef,sour cream,guacomole, onions and peppers and got very ill,weak,faint, I vomitted later that night. I called the front desk to tell them I felt very sick from the food in the restaurant and they were very unresponsive.
