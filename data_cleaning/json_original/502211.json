The air condition did not work well in the hallways and elevators. The personnel did not speak English well (even at the concierge), although they tried to help. They do not allow bringing food/beverages inside the hotel (why???). Our room was not serviced for the last 2 nights (did they expect tips???). The beach and swimming pool are nice though.

Some of the staff try to serve you with a smile so they get some points. The food is relatively good but only in the main restaurant - eating or drinking by the pools result in food poisoning. Very expensive too - a beer in the hotel is almost 4 times the price you get outside. We have paid quite a lot to stay here and it is certainly not worth that. However, if you get a cheap deal and come expecting a 3 star hotel you will be fine.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cgood location for summer stay in istanbul\u201d", "Author": "sumitminocha", "ReviewID": "UR98317468", "Content": "very far from the airport and the city but ideal for summer stay. lot of good crowd in the area during summers. awesome breakfast every morning. hotel is huge but it is quite old and well mantained. would be recommended for travelers who have been to istanbul many times and want to stay away from the city. wifi only in the lobby. no internet connection in the rooms.", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corfu Town, Greece", "Title": "\u201cConference destination\u201d", "Author": "spyros811", "ReviewID": "UR51855397", "Content": "i stayed there because of a conference and it was class!
