If you need 4 star accommodations, or even 2 star then these accommodations aren't for you. If you merely want a safe, fairly clean place to lay your head at night and wake up wake to one of the most beautiful beaches in the world then this is it. If you decide to stay here and want the ocean front units request 2B as the owner of this unit has furnished it nicely. It is too bad the there is not some sort of minimum requirements for the owners as the owner of 2A is probably the worst out of all of the units that we had the opportunity to see.

We were in #5. Traveled with my husband and 4 kids age 11, 4, and twins 18 months. We knew going in that the villas did not have cribs to rent or offer so we had to bring pack n plays. The Best thing about the beach villas are that they are right on flamenco beach. It is the most beautiful water/beach our family has ever been to. The villas were just ok. We read the reviews before coming so we were not expecting anything fancy. Our check in was fast as they charge you in full for your trip 2 weeks prior to you arriving so all we had to do was show up, it was already charged to us. We had a 1 bedroom for all of us. The beds were not very comfortable but we made do. My family loved the two hammocks and swing we had at our villa. We also had a large picnic table on the covered porch where we ate most meals. We read about mosquitos, yes there were some but we seemed to do ok. We also read about bed bugs, and did not seem to notice anything till we came home and had little bumps on our legs/arms but that could have been mosquito bites. BRING YOUR OWN BEACH TOWELS AS THEY DO NOT PROVIDE ANY. Also, they do not provide any soap, shampoo, or other. There is not maid service, or clean up service. On day two we did not get any fresh bath towels so I took it upon myself to take our used towels over to the crew and they gave me some fresh ones. The staff don't really bother you at all, so if you need something you can go looking for them. Wi fi worked during the day hours only, It seemed like every evening them must have turned it off or something. Cell phone signals are touch and go. Be warned, you will pay per person for a taxi so renting a car is a good idea. The grocery stores charge a lot for foods. We got basics and spent $90 for bread, p b and J, some waters, juices, snack items, and could not believe how the bills went up. We went to Milca grocery 3 times and spent $90 twice and $50 once for our 6 people. Kiosks close early, to our disappointment as we had 4 hungry kids and found them to close at 5pm one day and restaurants in town did not serve till after 6 pm. We were surprised at the lack on interest in \"paying customers\" as we arrived at Dinghy Docks one night for dinner. All that was open was the bar, we walked around looking for someone to seat us, greet us, or even give us the time of day and no one did. They had a sign that said dinner at 6pm it was 10 till and the waitress paid more attention to rolling silverware while talking on the phone and did not even bother to acknowledge us at all. We ended up going back to the villas and ate whatever we could find there. great snorkeling at Tamarindo Beach. We got to swim with the sea turtles and that was fun. We went twice. We would go back ONLY if we got a rental car in San Juan, stocked it up with the foods and supplies we needed first prior to coming to the island.....

While the Flamenco Beach is spectacular and second to none, I wish I could say the same about the accommodations at Culebra Beach Villas. We intially rented apartment 2A, a 2-bedroom oceanfront property; to say it was filthy is an understatement. There wasn't a single surface in the apartment that was clean, the stench was unbearable, the furnishings are old and worn, and, get ready for the best part...the place is infested with BED BUGS!! My husband and I were covered with bites; our vacation was ruined and we are still itching from the BED BUG bites nearly two weeks later. This is the part that amazes me...when they finally did move us to a tiny villa at the back of the property, I stopped at the office to advise them of the issue with the BED BUGS and staff in the office indicated that they were aware that the apartment was infested with BED BUGS and said that they had \"tried\" to spray for the BED BUGS, obviously ineffectively. She also indicated that they had talked to the owner of the unit a number of times in a effort to get him to clean the place up!! I was outraged to think that they charged us $250 a night for a place that was smelly, old, nasty, and they KNEW was infested with BED BUGS. We have traveled to a number of places throughout the Caribbean and by no means have we ever stayed in a 5 star resort or anything even remotely close. In fact, many of the places we have stayed in the past wouldn't even rate 1 star, but they are clean, clean, clean, which is all that really matters. It should be noted that each unit is independently owned, so the quality of the furnishings and interiors of the apartments and villas varies greatly since each owner is apparently responsible for the maintenance of their units. Our group rented a total of 5 apartment/villas and the quality ranged from horrible to adequate. Even though they did finally move us after the second night and refunded our money, I would not recommend Culebra Bach Villas to anyone unless you are well aware of the condition of the unit you are renting.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dayton", "Title": "\u201cFell asleep listening the waves...woke up with the roosters!\u201d", "Author": "Tbouy", "ReviewID": "UR125463050", "Content": "Returned yesterday from Culebra and had a great experience at Culebra Beach Villas.

We were in Villa 14. We arrived early because we took the 9:00 ferry and rented a jeep from Carlos Jeeps. We were able to get into our villa early which was a pleasant surprise. (I might add that the ferry, jeep rental process can be very stressful. We tried to get ferry tickets in advance but were unable to do so. We arrived at the ferry dock before 6:30 AM to get our tickets. Only one person can go to get the jeep so the others are left baking in the sun with the luggage at the ferry dock). Culebra Beach Villa Rentals look lovely at first glance. Each villa has an abundance of porch furniture and a grill which we were looking forward to using but the mosquitos were so bad you could not be outside for more than a minute without getting eaten alive. There was not a mosquito problem at the beach which was good. After spending some time at the beach the first day we made our way to a little store for groceries. Upon returning to the Villa to cook dinner, we found all of the cookware contained a layer of mouse droppings. It was disgusting and we refused to use the pans. We made our way back to the store and fortunately we were able to return our groceries. That meant eating out every night which was quite expensive. We paid $204 a night and were willing to do so with the assumption we could cook. When we talked to management the next morning about the mouse droppings, the woman came to our villa muttering about the maids not cleaning properly. She proceeded to dump all the mouse droppings onto the kitchen floor. When my husband told her not to do that - she swept them up. She took all of the cookware with her and offered to get us others, but we declined. She did not seem upset about the mouse problem only that we found out about it. On a whim, we placed a few cheerios in the cupboard, and they were gone within an hour. Obviously, the little creatures live there. We asked for a refund more than once and were told she was checking with the owner. Upon checking out, she still said she was checking. We will follow up but are not holding our breaths. Overall, the accomodations are not anything fancy, may or may not be clean, and apparently you never know what you will find. The beach was pretty but honestly, we have seen nicer beaches in Bermuda, Florida and Aruba. Snorkeling is very good right from the beach which is nice. We probably would not stay here again. Finally, be advised if you rent a car to allow plenty of time to fill it up with gas before your return ferry trip. We allowed a couple of hours and barely made it. We had to wait in a line for the only gas station on the island for a very long time. Once again, some were sitting at the ferry with the luggage while my husband took care of the jeep.

The kitchen was equipped with the basics and the place was clean. We had a side porch which had partial views of the beach, though it was very windy so we didn't spend as much time there as we would have liked. We did have several encounters with cockroaches in the apartment, but we honestly didn't feel like that was an issue. The biggest problem for us was the noise. We aren't particularly light sleepers, but Whether it was Spring Break college kids or large groups of main-islanders on the weekend, it seemed that there wasn't a night when we weren't kept up until 1 or 2 a.m. by partying guests staying in the apartments or in the adjacent villas. Since there is no on-sight management to control this, you are really on your own to deal with the problem. We did speak with someone in management after a really unbearable night and were told that the only thing we could do was to call the police. What we found to be particularly annoying about this was that the management's list of rules posted in each apartment states that noise after 10pm is not allowed but then they do nothing to enforce this rule.

The trip was divided into 3 nights stay at Vieques, 2 nights at Culebra and last 2 nights I spend in Old San Juan. Talking for myself one night would have been enough to explore the town (in case, that you are not into analytical sightseeing or gold shopping). Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take me wrong, the place is beautiful and incredibly atmospheric, but I prefer to spend my vacation outdoor, therefore I would exchange one night at SJ for an extra night on Vieques, still I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to Puerto Rico without paying visit to San Juan! WEATHER Weather was good, on the island only rained couple of times in the night, and lightly for short period of a day. In SJ rained quite often, but it made the walking easier. Generally I found this time of year good: not only for the weather, but also because the beaches were quite empty (except weekend on Flamingo Beach, Culebra, avoid if you can!) VIEQUES or CULEBRA? I preferred Vieques, but I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised if anyone would disagree.

It is unique for its Bioluminescent Bay (patently the best one in the world) as well as for the semi-wild horses running around. On the other hand Culebra is a tropical paradise in a more obvious way with eye-taking curves etc. It is CUTE. Basically the choice is yours: pick between the cute and the wild beauty. If you wish to visit both, the only direct transport between them is by air. Air Flamingo has number flies a day for 25$/oneway. One more unpleasant thing to mention is the constant presence of MOSQUITOS. I used Off (15% deet) during my stay and it didn't seem to help. I got bitten badly on everyday basis.

I was very apprehensive about this property given the poor reviews. After staying there myself I can report that I am pleasantly surprised. I would absolutely recommend this property. Specifically, I would recommend villa #7 (which is one of the concrete villas behind the tall main building). We stayed three nights in villa #7.

It is right on the beach, and the easiest way to enjoy an amazing location! In short ... you stay at this property for the beach. Period. The owners know that. That's why it is not an amazing property. However, it's not a dump either (as some report). It is nice, with a certain charm. We loved the beach and found the accommodations acceptable. The bed is small and austere. The shower is a little run down, but acceptable. The villa has a mini-kitchen with fridge, microwave and stovetop (which was a BIG bonus for us, because we cooked our own food - saving $ on eating out and taxis). If you go to this property with the understanding that you are going for the beach and not the resort experience, you will have an amazing time. Why? Because the beach is that damn good. Flamenco Beach is such an amazing crescent of beach-heaven that you won't matter that the villa is a little run down in places. Everything about the beach is amazing. Don't expect much in the way of facilities. This is a hidden treasure of a beach. I have been to the best beaches in Hawaii, Florida, Caribbean, etc., and this is one of the best I have found.

The villas had all I needed- from comfortable bed to great equipment kitchen and above all the location which was perfect as I really wanted to wake up everyday in one of the most amazing and famous beaches- Flamenco. I also loved the hammock/sling which was quite good when I wanted to rest outside. There's also barbeque place in each villa. On the other hand, you must take in mind that flamenco beach is little bit isolated in Culebra. I came in Culebra in off season so I didn't expect to see much of tourists, but to be honest I was little bit shock to find out that I was the only one there on my first day of arrival. Moreover, when I got to the beach rental the office was empty and no one actually checked in me. The owner left me a note with the room number also saying the key was inside the room (villa 15). After settling, I realized that I need to go back to the main area of the island for some groceries but unfortunately my cellular didn't have sign so when I tried to call from the public phone near the office I found out that there was no line there too. After few days one of the locals explained me that during construction in the island they hit the public phone lines so they no longer work in all island (September \u00e2\u20ac\u201cOctober 2007). So I had to walk all the way back to the city for water and food I needed. I believe that if someone was there at the office to check me in, he would have called taxi for me. My tip for you is after you drop off the ferry, make a stop in grocery store which is very close to the ferry place and make sure you get all you need. Another thing you should take in mind that taxi ends their service around 05:30 pm. As for the season - the end of September and beginning of October- I guess I was lucky because rain caught me only one day and it was mostly raining at night, so I had the whole day for \"beaching\". Even though it wasn't the perfect place I would dream of for my vacation, you have to face the true- the location of it RULEZ. And If you're on beach vacation, I don't believe you'll enjoy the same if you weren't staying at Flamenco (which is, as I see it, the biggest and only attraction in the island).

Most days we hiked a mile or so to go snorkeling along a coral reef that had the most incredible sea life. We got there by 9 or 9:30 and had the beach to ourselves for quite sometime. I love to travel and explore whenever I can. I've been so very lucky to have visited incredibly beautiful beaches on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the panhandle of Florida, Harbour Island in the Bahamas, Essaouira in Morocco and Zanibar off the coast of Tanzania. Flamenco Beach in Culebra is one of the most spectacular. We loved the relaxing atmosphere of the villas. We didn't mind the roosters roaming around and cockledoodledooing 24/7. We enjoyed the party life of some of our neighbors in villas closeby. We liked vacationing with the locals. I wish I could return tomorrow.

When I asked the next morning to be moved, I was told that all the rooms were taken. That was not true. There were very few people on the property. Even on the weekend, it didn't look like even half the units were being used. I walked around at night and counted those with lights. I was in 1-C. The couple next to me was in 1-E. (I don't know what happened to 1-D. Maybe that's where Harry Potter and his friends stay!) 1-E was even worse than mine, narrower, and only one window in the kitchen and none in the bedroom. They had made their reservation in November. I had made mine October 8. Why the resort assigned such horrible rooms to early renters and why they refused to move us to something better is a mystery. I talked to three young people who had a better unit on the second floor, and they had just made their reservation the weekend before. I met another couple who invited me to see their room. It was on the second floor front and was very nice, French doors opening onto the porch with a great view. Lots of windows. They had made their reservation only three weeks earlier, at the end of December! Maybe many of the other upper rooms are as nice as theirs and that's why we are reading such drastically different reviews about this place.", "Date": "February 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cRustic, Romantic and Right on the Beach!\u201d", "Author": "ladyesq", "ReviewID": "UR11987587", "Content": "Just to set the context, I'm a woman in my mid-30s who travels for pleasure frequently and lives in NYC. Just got back from a stay here over xmas 2007. Culebra Beach Villas I have to agree with the other reviewers, that when you go to Culebra Beach Villas, you should go into it knowing what to expect - and you will not be disappointed. These are clean places to sleep, somewhere to keep your beer or beach drinks cold and to hang your snorkeling gear or bathing suits to dry - but not much else. You don't need anymore as one of the most beautiful beaches in the world sits feet away. You definitely stay here for the location. The villas are very basic. We stayed in #10, which was a 1-bdroom. Paid US$175 per night. The outer room had 2 twin beds and since there was only 2 of us traveling, we were able to spread out our stuff. Our villa was complete with microwave, fridge, stove, sink, etc. -- what you need to put together a snack or lunch. The bedroom was fine, the sheets and pillowcases appeared to be clean - athough if you have dust mite allergies as I do, best to bring your own pillow/sheet dust mite covers - I could tell there were a lot of dust mites in the bedroom. Our villa didn't have a hammock but there were several nearby and they are big enough for two. Although we would've loved a little more water pressure in the shower, we had plenty of room, hot water, in the bathroom etc. If you desire large bath towels, bring your own. The ones they give you do the trick, but they are small and they are not changed during your stay (the sheets/pillowcases are not changed either unless you are there longer than 4 days). Ditto on beach towels as they are not provided. All other places to stay are in town or by the harbor - this is the only place steps from the beach. Our front door lock was squeaky and the AC in the bedroom wasn't as strong as we'd like, but hey, you're in Culebra! Beach I've been to a lot of beaches around the world - this one is truly breathtaking. Pristine white sand. Gorgeous blue water with mild surf and no condos or other buildings anywhere in sight. Very few people as well. . Definitely walk the beach at night - the stars are amazing. Other stuff Tony, who runs the front desk, is helpful and responsive. He set us up with kayaks and made some local calls for us (our cells didn't get any reception at the Villas, only in town). We rented beach chairs for $5 each per day (though they take them back at 4pm). We saw some people bbq-ing, but we thought the grills were a bit spartan and dirty and ours was missing the grill part. Lots of beach cats, hens and roosters and a friendly but nosy beach dog at the Villas - we had fun with them as they are relatively clean and tame and we even bought some cheap chicken feed in town. While the road to the villas is bumpy as it is unpaved, we preferred being able to \"get away\" even from the small town in Culebra so we were really alone. The Villas runs on cisterrn water - better to be safe than sorry - drink only bottled water, you can buy it by the gallon relatively cheaply in the supermercado in town. Snorkeling by the hotel is not great, the reefs are pretty dead. If you check the threads for Culebra, you'll learn there are closeby snorkling sites that are excellent. Make sure you buy what you need in town - sun screen, snacks, mosquito/bug spray (a MUST) etc as there are no amenities like this at the villas. Strongly recommend you rent a car if you are staying more than a day or two. I recommend eating at Barbara Rosas - great home cooking, right on her porch.

Our unit was on the 3rd floor - lots of stairs, but that wasn't a problem for us. The balcony overlooked the beach - the views were fantastic. The unit was spartan, but extremely clean. The beds were OK, linens were basic. The kitchen was stocked with all the basic essentials for cooking, but nothing else was supplied except sponge and soap (e.g., no paper towels). We used the BBQs downstairs. Tony, the property manager, was friendly and helpful. He gave us his restaurant recommendations and happily fixed a A/C unit in one of our bedrooms. Ice and water are available for sale from the office. A car is a necessity here, in my opinion, for grocery shopping and restaurant meals in town.

The beach, as everybody notes, is gorgeous. Staying in these villas means that you can sit on the pure white sand at night and watch the moonlight AND take an early morning stroll right up to where there are colorfully painted former US tanks. There is supposedly good snorkeling on the right side of the beach, but be careful, the water can get rough sometimes. There is some nice snorkeling at Carlos Rosario and Tamarindo, a short walk from here. Overall, we highly recommend this experience.

Since each villa is individually owned I can only rate the room that we were in but it was perfect !!! I would only stay at CBV again! The entire place was very nice and clean. Being on the beach is incredible! What no one has posted before is that the public beaches close at dark. I don't know how well they enforce it, but technically they are closed. The sun sets around 5:30 and by 6:30 it is dark! When staying at CBV you have your own private end of the beach and Flamenco beach is prettier than the photos on the websites! I promise!! Our first night there we went walking on the beach under a blanket of stars and danced on the beach. We were up early the next morning playing in the water. We hiked over to Carlos Rosario and snorkled. The path was much harder to locate than we'd planned but we found it. The air conditioner in the room worked almost too well! The best way to plan your visit is to bring your own food if come over on the ferry ;otherwise, go to the store after you arrive, buy what you need and don't leave CBV until it is time to leave the island. The rest of the island left us a bit cold, but the beach was awesome. We would go back and take friends in a heatbeat! They have an outdoor grill on the patio of every villa and an outdoor table and chairs. There is no reason to leave. Just hang out and relax. I highly recommend CBV.

They are both increcdible, pristine and unique! But Culebra Beach Villas was definitely not what was advertised. Too bad I didn\u00c2\u00b4t listen to friends and reviews! My birthday was not so much fun due to my decision to stay in this place...I will try to explain so future visitors can make an informed decision according to their interests. First, the posivie reviews I have read refer mainly to the shacks that are located behind the main building (individual apartments). THOSE are rather nice and clean but they don\u00c2\u00b4t have a view since the main building blocks it. Neverthless, the main building is, simply, falling apart and the owners don\u00c2\u00b4t want to invest money in it since the government is apparently trying to eliminate the oceanfront structure because it is damaging the beach (it is literally in the sand). I managed to get in touch with the owner because the nice people form JM Rentals, seeing as we were going to leave early from Culebra, got us in touch with him. To no use, since the second room they gave us was still in the same main building and again had no electricity in part of the room (the bathroom, so no hot water) and the alarm went off at 7am!!!! there were no employees around so nothing was done about it... Although the beach is RIGHT in front and it is amazing!!!! there is no restaurant except for a place they want to call a bar or something, but just looking at it with its flies and the stench made you want to go elsewhere. So, you are at the beach but have to move around to eat if you don\u00c2\u00b4t have a kitchen or just don\u00c2\u00b4t want to cook. Taxis don\u00c2\u00b4t like to drive there since the small road into the hotel is full of potholes... If you want beachfront and some place to eat, go with Tamarindo Estates. Although the beach is not directly in front of the hotel and Flamenco is way better, it is still really close by and the hotel is wonderful for around the same price. Culebra Beach Villas, for the price, is not comparable to other hotels. I would never expect luxury in Culebra since its charm is kinda roughing it, but I do expect clean rooms, electricity, and at least cordial staff when things get tough. Especially for the price (I payed 135 plus 9% tax for a full bed)! So if you idea is to honeymoon, to have nice places to eat around and you don\u00c2\u00b4t have a car, beware of Culebra Beach Villas! If you want to have a nice beach walking distance and have a car to drive to restaurants, ask specifically for a shack in the back and hope the staff is in a good mood that day!", "Date": "July 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando", "Title": "\u201cJust what I was looking for\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4717205", "Content": "My wife and relatives stayed here last year and told me what a great beach Flamenco Beach was, to the point that we all decided to visit again this year.
