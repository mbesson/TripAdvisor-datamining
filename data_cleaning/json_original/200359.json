Again, some of the lowest quality breakfast in a Western chain hotel I can remember. I would have gladly paid to eat at the next door American style diner but that was closed for breakfast. No safes in the rooms. You'd think that a hotel catering to business travellers would provide them in the rooms. All this and I paid EUR 109.

It is just across the road, connected by an under-road walkway, so there is no need to cross the busy Kantstrasse or Messedam roads. It is close to an S-Bahn station (Nord-ICC) and a U-Bahn station (Kaiserdam) which gives convenient access to the efficient Berlin transport system. I booked this hotel, not just because of its location, but because, as part of the Accor group, I could rely on a known level of standards, with which I have always been happy. The Ibis Messe fits well within these standards. The room was spacious enough, without being large. The bed was very comfortable and I had no trouble sleeping. There was no no noise apparent from my room on the 7th floor, but I was on the far side to the roads, so it is otherwise difficult to assess. Room amenities were basic, but adequate, as to be expected. There was no fridge or tea and coffee making facilities, but this was not important to me. The bathroom was functional, with a small shower, which was a little awkward to get into and out of, but water was hot and pressure was good. Drainage was a little slow, so the water built up at your feet by the end of the shower. This was only a minor quibble and was reported to the reception staff. The staff at reception were very helpful and had badges identifying which languages they speak, generally English and German, but other languages were also evident. They were most useful to me when I needed to get to locations across the city, and needed to navigate the various train changes. Breakfast was a very good cold collation of bread meats, dairy, fruit and cereals, which provided a good start to the day. There is Chinese restaurant on the first floor which serves large, excellent meals at a reasonable price. Highly recommended. The hotel may not be as convenient if you are in Berlin for sight-seeing, but, being near a station would mean that nothing is too far away in Berlin. Overall, a good stay which meets, and probably exceeds, my expectations of an Ibis Hotel.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jakarta, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cvalue for money\u201d", "Author": "lundia", "ReviewID": "UR93124315", "Content": "When you see this hotel for the 1st time, keep in mind : don't judge the book by its cover.

No internet inside the room, but there's 2 free computers with internet in the reception area. As we only stayed for 1 night, it didn't matter at all. The reception area is clean, neat, and very much different to the outside. For check-in / check-out, the receptionist did the task efficiently and quick. This hotel is right next to the Eurolines bus station. Taxis are parking just outside the hotel. However, the nearest U-bahn or S-bahn takes about 10 minutes walk. If you arrived by train (Berlin Hbf) and has lotsa luggages, better take a taxi as it takes only 10 minutes away. We didn't take the breakfast at the hotel. Eating out in Berlin is quite cheap.

Temperatures stayed in the minus range during that week ranging from minus 4 to minus 12 degrees Celsius . I paid 49 euros per night as I booked my stayed on Ibis's website. I chose this hotel as I arrived via long distance bus from Dresden & all I did was to roll my luggage for a few seconds & viola, I was at its doorstep. So if you arrive at ZOB Berlin Central Bus Terminal, this hotel is the most convenient. The room was huge and that is where the heating problem started. The radiator was the fan based type located high above, close to the ceiling. I turned it to the maximum temperature of 30 degrees Celsius and adjusted the the fan level to high. As the room was big, there were pockets of it that remained chilly especially close to the window area. Also there were no radiators in the bathroom, there was only a palm sized circular ventilation hole on the ceiling that released warm air which was NOT sufficient to warm the bathroom. I rather prefer the single or double pipe radiators that are attached to the walls rather than a fan based radiator as the room gets very very dry within a short period of time with a fan based radiator. Nevertheless, despite the heating issues, the room was quiet. Housekeeping was not up to par as I noticed that the WC was not cleaned properly when I checked in. Could have done a better job compared to the single room ensuite bathroom at A&O hostel I stayed in Dresden which was spotless. The best part of this Ibis Hotel was the free internet service provided in the reception area for hotel guests who did not bring along their laptops. The free internet service was extremely fast & reliable and can be accessed at any time of the day & night, 24/7. I did not partake in the breakfast service as I do not find it worth it.

So, okay for sightseeing, and a good night sleep is guaranteed with some very efficient German glazing - didn't hear a peep the 3 days I stayed there. It looks pretty awful and impersonal from the outside, but the reception and breakfast room the made an effort to make it look simple yet classy. Same goes for rooms - certainly a notch up from the moulded unit bathrooms and dated furniture I got so used to in ever-reliable Ibis. Rooms big enough, nice big desk facing window, new big-ish TV and up to date TV listings magazine, lovely comfortable bed (firm mattress and super clean bed linen). Very clean. Breakfast was nice, good choice of foods, nice quality food, fresh coffee.
