It's biggest disadvantage is it is slightly outside the tourist zone if you want to easily walk to places and minimize tube and taxi. But this is London, you have to expect to take transport most places you go unless your like me, a walker. It was coming off the royal wedding when all hotels rooms were overpriced, and so paid as much as for a 4 star a week later. Having said that, it was priced better than the rest. Rooms were very clean and functional, and while not splashy, were modern in design, and slightly larger than comparable London hotels in this price range. Wifi is available at a fee. Front desk staff were very helpful, and their simple bus guide to access to the city was useful . Breakfast for the price was adequate and comparable to other places - not fine dining, but gets you going for the day. Be warned though, closest tube, is Elephant and Castle. With luggage, it is one to be missed, and trying to get a taxi outside is awkward. I found it better to get off at Waterloo and take a 10-12 GBP taxi ride to hotel, especially at night, or with bags.

I've stayed in tiny, overpriced rooms in Bayswater, and so I appreciated the really spacious and comfortable modern room that we got here. The bathroom was spotless and, incredibly, everything worked well. Even the hairdryer was good! We got an excellent deal on Booking.com so no matter how dire the hotel might be, we weren't complaining. Even at the standard rates displayed in the lobby (GBP 99 per night for a double) it would have been ok. BUT: the hotel is really far away from Tower Bridge and you can't walk from the nearest tube (Elephant and Castle) because it's not a nice stroll through pretty streets, it's a long walk through absolutely miserable and honestly spooky areas. This is not a nice area of town. We had to take a taxi to the tube station every time, so if you stay here, only do it because you've got such an amazing deal that you can splash out on taxis all the time. We paid GBP 39 per night for our room, so we could get away with it, but deals like that are rare, and we were very lucky. The staff were reserved and quiet, but did help us with small things that we asked for; just don't expect huge smiles and \"Receptionist of the Year\" material. The room was either freezing or boiling, we never managed to suss out the air conditioning system so it was on and off all the time, and the windows were locked so no fresh air was available. Mind you, the street was so noisy that you can forget sleeping with the window open anyway - there were ambulances, police cars and fire trucks rocketing along the road every 10 mins or so all night long. Yep, bring ear plugs or get a room facing the back. We bought a good English breakfast at Elephant and Castle (by the tube) at Wetherspoon's for half the price of the hotel breakfast. I would never stay at the hotel alone as a female traveller, but travelling with others it was ok. (There's a Chinese/Sezchuan restaurant with access from the hotel lobby. The food was very good, very authentic, but NB: like a handful of other places in London, they slapped on a service charge of 10 %, not stated anywhere on the menu or otherwise, which annoyed us.) All in all, the hotel itself was excellent value by London standards (even if you're paying the standard rate) and it was surprisingly clean, modern and comfortable. It's just a real shame that it's placed in such a horrible spot and is so far from the tube. There is a bus stop just outside the hotel, but the buses take longer in London traffic and are harder for tourists to negotiate than the very user-friendly tube. I wouldn't stay there again and therefore wouldn't recommend it, but that's only because of the location.

Our visit was to the Oval cricket ground and this was perfect, very reasonable rates, we got 2 bus stops and 2 northern line stops although we walked back from the tube its all one road and it was about 20mins walk. The reception staff were very friendly and the lobbey was very nice, our room was very nice, compact but had space for what we needed you had a safe, fridge, tea & coffee making wall mounted tv, iron board, all in all very good value and extremely clean and comfy bed and airy room. I would recommend this hotel especially if you want value for money, breakfast was \u00a310 but we did not have this so cannot comment, Great stay", "Date": "August 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood Quality Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Obafemi123", "ReviewID": "UR33365131", "Content": "I like the services of the staff ,I read review by someone she said staff are rude but staff are very friendly.I was thr when this lady came to cpomplain.She didn't stay at the hotel she is living opp to the hotel.It doesn't make any different for the hotel if you put the your reviews outside the hotel.Church people start at 12 o'clock not in the morning.", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWorst hotel in London...\u201d", "Author": "Princess1980London", "ReviewID": "UR31204679", "Content": "Woken up by music blaring from car outside, unloading music equipment into hotel.

Great price, very clean, well looked after rooms with nice decor and super comfy bed and pillows. We stayed three nights Sat-Tues had booked two rooms. Local ameneties i.e food not so great however bus stops right near hotel entrance and it's a 24hr bus service, not too expensive in a taxi either to centre of London-we were \u00a314. People in local grocers very nice and helpful and sell the all day bus tickets which are great. Area not much to look at but I felt safe enough. My shower wasnt working so I had to move rooms after first night-staff were very helpful. Large TV on wall which had built in freeview-great. Kettle supplied in room for tea/coffee. Small fridge supplied in room. Only downside no wardrobe! Only a small clothes rail with few hangers on it. DO NOT use the Chinese adjoined to the building, worst meal i've ever had!! However my parents liked the food in Ozzies cafe just a few doors down. I recommend you eat before returning to hotel as local amenities are a bit scarce. There is a Tesco just along the road from hotel. Also people had chinese takeaway meals delivered to hotel from elsewhere which hotel staff were ok with and supplied plates, cutlery etc. If your looking for an above average hotel (I loved it and can be fussy) then this is it but I definetely recommend it and would return.", "Date": "January 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cClean hotel on main bus route\u201d", "Author": "WallyLondon", "ReviewID": "UR17758385", "Content": "Clean hotel. Comfortable beds. Rooms are small but very typical of rooms in Europe. The building has been converted into a hotel December of 2007.

There are small markets nearby and fresh cooked chickens which were tasty for dinner. It takes two buses or the tube and a bus to get there from Victoria station.

The style would match that of temperatures outside of 80degrees but in cold London - tiles on the floor, lino as flooring in the room, air conditioning which doesn't heat the room well doens't match the requirements for this country. Taps in the bathrrom only pore water if you bend over and are close enough will automatically come on and you get soaked. The shower is small and an issue for anyone trying to have a wash! No bar - well it's part of reception and not inviting. The dining area is not comfortable and cold and bland in the morning. The walk from Elephant and Castle is long around 20 mintues and with a bag not good. Also, the hotel is not in a nice area. The hotel doesn't have an evening restaurant and will invite pizza and chinese companies to deliver take aways. There are no local restaurants I would feel comfortable in - carribean run restaurants, I saw gangs on the streets and went swiftly back to the hotel. Traffic is a huge issue in the morning and delays if you have meetings. The bed was comfortable and have flat screens but feel they have cut corners all over the place to save money and has had a detrimental feeling to comfort and a relaxing ambience. Asked to leave as soon as I checked in but I had paid and no refunds. Stayed for 3 nights.
