But access to Venice is really easy: the vaporetto stop (line 1) is at a 10 to 12 minutes walk from the hotel. The trip with the vaporetto is max 15 minutes.

It is only 20 minutes boat ride from San Marco to Lido. The hotel prices are almost half price, and it is more quiet for resting after long days walking the canals. The restaurants in Lido are cheaper and the service better. If you are staying more than a day or two, buy a 3 or more days bus ticket, or the Venice tourist card. Any way we stayed at \"Le Ville del Lido\" for 5 days and was worth every cent we payed. The hotel is located 5 minutes walking distance from the Lido boat stop and the shopping area, where most of the restaurants, super markets are and only a few steps from the beach. It is built on a large area, by the sea. For those who don't like to walk, there is a bus stop just outside the hotel, however I am not sure how often the bus services this area. The building blocks of the hotel are around a large pool area, very suitable for families and small kids. The rooms are spacious, rustic style, heavy curtains, nice bathrooms, a kitchen area where cooking is possible. TV set (our was not working), hair dryer available. A nice thing for families is that the apartments have 2 bedrooms . There is also an internal staircase, leading to a very spacious veranda, with a parasol, sunbed, a table and chairs, for those who wish to take their breakfast outdoors,or relax and suntan.Room service available on a daily basis, the personnel is very polite and helpful. There is no restaurant in this hotel. There is wireless internet available, but NOT all of the buildings are covered, due to the distance from the reception were the router is located. In this case you can always visit the reception area where there is a salon to stay for as long you need to read your emails etc. This hotel is not smoking, but for those who smoke the veranda option is available. All in all that was an excellent choice, we saved a lot of money and our stay was perfect.

I can only echo the good things already said here by previous reviewers. We found the hotel easily having taken the Alilaguna boat from the airport. We walked straight down the main street,(noting the Billa supermarket en route) turned right at the bottom, past the Hotel des Bains (currently being renovated) and then turned right and into the hotel. We were met by a friendly and helpful english speaking receptionist and were then taken to our appartment which was spacious and clean. There were just two of us, so the spare bedroom and bathroom were locked. The small kitchinette area was well equipped and proved very useful for breakfasts and we also cooked a couple of dinners too. There was no kettle so we boiled water for drinks in a pan, and strangely no tin opener! But anything else you could think of was there, including plenty of crockery, glasses and cutlery. It was good to have the extra space - a lounge/dining area with the kitchinette as well as our en-suite bedroom - especially on the rainy windy day we experienced, when we stayed in most of the day and a cramped hotel room would have been very restrictive. The pool area looked lovely - but it was too cold for dip - likewise for the beach - which is just across the road. The only criticicm we had was that of a lack of sound proofing. On several occasions we could hear the voices of our neighbours - though only when we were in our bedroom.

When I booked it, I imagined that this would be some relaxing down time for us after some busy touring. It was perfect. We arrived in Venice at the train station and took water bus #51 to the last stop which is Lido. I believe the #1 bus also ends up there, but is a longer route. We ended up taking a taxi to the hotel as we had quite a bit of luggage, but it really is only a 10 or 15 minute walk through town for those wanting to do some site seeing right in Venice. What a lovely place. A very nice man at reception checked us in and helped us with our bags. The room was very nice - separate room for our kids and a comfy room for us. Two bathrooms were a treat. They were very clean - smallish and maybe not the best water pressure, but very adequate. Had a lovely roof top patio with a table and chairs and there was a place to hang laundry. We didn't really use the kitchenette except for the fridge, and there wasn't a microwave, just a stove top. Teeny TV with lots of German stations, some Italian and a couple of English. But, we weren't there to watch TV. The whole property is covered with beautiful gardens and archways and the pool was wonderful. There were very comfortable lounge chairs with umbrellas and you can purchase ice cream and drinks from reception. My kids were in heaven after several days of trains and lots of walking. The included breakfast is served by the pool on nice days and in the basement on cooler days. Loved eating outside, and it was a nice breakfast with yummy pastries, fruits, toast, cheese,ham etc. It had seemed from the web site that there was a cost for internet, but we were given a code without cost. We couldn't get reception from our room, but could use our ipads sitting around the pool, which was just fine. The hotel is right across the street from a stunning beach. There are beach huts available to rent, but we just used our towels and baked in the hot sun. There is a little lunch place right outside the hotel on the way to the beach that was great for a quick bite. Reception gave us excellent suggestions for restaurants in town - and there were also many pizzerias and pasta places. Tons of gelato shops which of course we had to visit every day. There is also a very clean laundromat close by that was very welcome and handy!! You don't even have to buy the soap - it automatically dispenses into the machine! We did take the water bus to piazza San Marco to wander around one day. We were going to stay right in Venice later on our trip, so it wasn't a priority, but the kids loved the pigeons in the square! Once thing, the cost of the water buses was increased in the last year or so, and it is 6.50 euros, if I remember correctly, per ride per person no matter what stop you are getting off at. So, having to pay that much for each of us going and coming made for a very expensive day of transportation for a very short ride to the square. Oh well!! We loved staying on this little island - very cute, quiet and a nice little retreat from the busy, touristy areas. It seemed like a lot of Italians take their vacations here and have vacations homes. I would definitely stay here again if we are lucky enough to return to Venice. I would probably stay a few days here and then a few in the heart of Venice as it is such a unique and fascinating place.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "JHB", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay anywhere else\u201d", "Author": "Tinago007", "ReviewID": "UR117415642", "Content": "The Lido is an oasis on the edge of Lido island, 10 minutes walk from the water taxis.

Out of all the places we travelled, we would go back tomorrow to Lido and stay at this hotel. Upon arrival at 8 pm, our reservations could not be located by Hotel management. Looking weary after a delayed 10 hr. flight, that left 5 hours later than expected, missing our direct water taxi stop for Lido, having to get off in Venice, to go back to catch a water bus, lugging our luggage up & down the steps of Venice, arriving in Lido 6 hours later than expected with no vehicle taxi to take to our destination, meant having to take the Lido City bus - Italians that spoke no english were GREAT - showed them the Hotel we were going to, with sign language welcoming us to join them on the bus, and then ringing for us to get off - in the dark getting off the bus, with no street lights and no signs for the Hotel; we turned left, instead of right; arriving at the Hotel @ 8:30 PM - the first thing the Hotel Mgr asked me, was what type of wine we would enjoy! I took the white, while hubby had the red. The Hotel Mgr proceeded to tell us, they did not have a reservation for us and unfortunately they were filled for tonight - Sat.-except for an emergency room that keep for their staff. I asked if it was clean and with hot water - I just wanted a shower! It was, but it was in the basement - of course! We took it - the Hotel Mgr helped hubby down the beautiful winding staircase (of course no elavator) to our room. By this time it was after 9 PM and were starving. Hotel Mgr provided directions to walking distance restuarants and off we were - in the dark, unlight back streets of Lido, having no ideal where we were going. Took the Hotel advice for dining, at a great rest., that had a back garden area - just what we needed. The next morn, a different Hotel Mgr noted there was a mix up between Expedia and the 3rd party Italian travel agency they use, and there would be no charge for last night. Our plans for Sunday were to travel into Venice and sightsee - which we did, after enjoying the included breakfast. The hotel staff moved us from the basement room to our booked garden room on the 2nd floor. Upon arriving back after our sightseeing day, we were warmly welcomed by all, and our suite had a beautiful, separate bedroom with a large bathroom and loads of cupboards, and a large sitting and dining area with fridge, kettle, toaster. We felt like we had arrived home - it was a lovely feeling. Staff once again provided us with great recommendations for dining, sightseeing on Lido, and the back area waters of Venice.

The bag contained a lot of cash a diamond watch, 2 Tiffany necklass and braclets sets plus, a passport, international drivers licience and most of my credit cards. The next morning when unable to find my precious goods normally kept in the safe phoned Le Ville. Marko answered... Oh yes, don't worry they are in the hotel safe we will keep them there for you. A quick flight back to Venice found all to be in order. Nothing missing ... and this is Italy. Cannot thank them enough.

We were delighted to find Le Ville del Lido, a suite hotel set on the Lido beach island of Venice. For a total price including taxes of 90 euros a night, we had a very comfortable apartment-style suite with bedroom, living room and kitchenette, continental breakfast included. It is about a 10-minute walk from the Lido vaporetto (water bus) stop, with St. Marks Square about 15 minutes away by water bus. After sightseeing in Venice during the day we were always relieved to return to the Lido, which is much more mellow and relaxed, but it was always easy to return to central Venice in the evening if we wanted. The grounds of Le Ville are spacious and green with lots of lawn and shrubbery (it is an ideal place for families with younger children as they have space to play). A large pool had just opened for the season while we were there. Lido restaurants are a short walk away and the room had a small refrigerator. The staff is pleasant and helpful.

Stayed in a one-bedroom ground-floor apartment, which was spacious and clean. The staff were extremely friendly, the breakfast good and the pool area fantastic. We'd never visited Venice before, so I wondered whether we should have booked a hotel in the city, but I'm glad we didn't. Although the city is beautiful, it was very very busy and we really enjoyed coming back to the Lido mid-afternoon and spending a couple of relaxing hours by the pool. The beach across the road was fantastic, but I'm ashamed to say we never made it into the sea as the pool at the hotel was too nice to leave. We headed back to Venice most evenings for dinner - as another reviewer says, the boat ride is magical, especially at night. On our final night we stayed on the Lido and had a delicious meal at one of the restaurants on the main street. Would have eaten on the Lido again if our trip had been longer. Best tip - buy a three day vaporetti pass. It costs 30E per person, but we hopped back and forth so much that we would have spent at least twice that buying single tickets. The hotel's very easy to get to - about 50 minutes and 12E from Marco Polo airport to the Lido, then a 10 minute walk to the hotel. The vaporetto ride to St Marks is just over 10 minutes, and the vaporetti run late into the night. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel. I hope to return to Venice, and when I do I'll definitely stay here again.", "Date": "October 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cFabulous stay on Lido\u201d", "Author": "mezzo50", "ReviewID": "UR8141319", "Content": "We started off our Italy trip on beautiful island of Lido, which is a quick boat ride to Venice.

Breakfast room was downstairs and small, and breakfast was average. The boats to Venice were a good walk from the hotel, but manageable.

Very very stylish self catering apartments with a hotel feel - fabulous swimming pools. Continental breakfast is included in the price - this is in a room next to the Main Reception. We flew into Marco Polo, and the waterbus took about 40 mins to the Lido. From the Lido bus stop it is about a 10 min walk to the hotel. No problem with kids - the walk takes you up the main street with cafes, shops and numerous galati shops. Each day we went over to Venice on the waterbus - apx 10 mins to St Marks Square. We would have a late morning snack /ice cream, and then either lunch out or head back to the hotel for lunch in our apartment, rest and then an afternoon in the pool. I think whenever you go to Venice - the city will be busy with tourists, so it was fab to head off back to our restful apartment and pool each afternoon. In the evenings we either headed back to Venice for a wander and some dinner - or wandered into the main strip in Lido and ate there. A lot of the beaches on the Lido seem to be private, connected to certain swish hotels, but the main public beach is just a 5 min stroll from the hotel. Its very nice - and has a beautiful restaurant - right on the beach. This was great as our kids could eat their dinner and then go for a play on the sand right infront of us, and my husband & I could relax with a nice bottle of wine - superb! There is also another gelati shop next to the restaurant so if you dont fancy the dessert menu head for an ice cream. My husband & I had been to venice before on our own and stayed in the city, however I really enjoyed the views that we got everyday when we took the boat from Lido to Venice - absolutely spectacular -especially at night. Our money seemed to go a long way on the holiday - free breakfast at the hotel - lunch at the apartment or a cafe, dinners were fairly expensive as them seem to pile on a \"per head\" charge just for being there, and extras for bread etc etc. However unless you are a wine connosieur - the restaurant house wine was alway very quaffable where ever we went. There's lots of simple things to interest kids - feeding pigeons, ice cream, people dressed in festival costumes and masks. Also as you walk around the streets - there is no such thing as a Tesco - each shop seems to sell one line of goods - gloves, sweets, masks, wallets. Also lots of bridges to walk over the canals - stopping to catch different views, see Gondolas, play in the fountains.
