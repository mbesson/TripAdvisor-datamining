We paid extra to stay in the \"President\" area, which includes an upgraded room and daily breakfast which is supposed to be available in the top-floor breakfast room (away from the craziness that can accompany breakfast in the main room). Despite the hotel being very busy over the long Easter weekend, the hotel closed the breakfast room for the holiday. This created a significant mess in the main dining room; people standing around waiting for a table was common. While this may seem like a small thing, when you pay extra for a service and it is not provided, it can be very frustrating. Otherwise, it was a nice stay. The room was big by Europe standards and very quiet (due to the upgrade). The front-desk staff is very efficient and not speaking German was not an issue. The bar is a nice area, but they still allow people to smoke in there (ugh).

Arrived on March 17th from Tegel Airport, airfare to Best Western Hotel President was about 18 euros. The location is in the Western part of the city near Tiergarten and there is a metro stop about a 5 minute walk from the hotel and a late night supermarket (not open on Sundays) around the corner. The location is good, because it's also near a very busy shopping district. It does not seem like it though unless you walk towards it (just head towards the big dept. store KaDeWe). Service wise, the staff was so friendly and warm. They were very helpful in all questions and pleasant. I was a bit disappointed in the room, the size was not a problem but the furniture is definitely a bit dated. Some of the chairs had holes in them, etc. Not a big deal since you're just there to sleep though right?? But of all the hotels on my trip, this was my least fave hotel. However, the price is very good and the hallways and the lobby were fine. There is a spa/gym downstairs in the basement that i did not check out but that's nice to have. They do offer a breakfast buffet but we didn't have it as part of our rsvp. Do NOT go eat in the square by the hotel (only close place with shops/food). Of all the places we went to while we were in Berlin, it was by far the most expensive meal we had. The staff always directed us to go eat near the Nikolaivertel area (close to museum island) for quality German meals at better prices. Also, you will get to know Bus 100, which takes you around the park and up to Potsdam Platz, the Berliner Domer, and Bradenburg gate, in addition to other key touristy sites. The bus stop is around the corner from the hotel on the left side. If I were to go to Berlin again, I'd probably find another place to stay, only because the room wasn't as nice as I thought it would. I noticed right next door, there is a hotel that looked pretty new and modern and chic called Motel One. Prices seem on par with Hotel President, perhaps another option?", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangkok", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel with even nicer staff\u201d", "Author": "Jackyboy98", "ReviewID": "UR126255041", "Content": "Stayed here for ITB and had a good experience.

Be aware that check in is at 2pm, although the staff were kind enough to take our luggage into storage for us whilst we explored the area. Our well sized room had a huge window looking out to the front of the hotel, with lots of storage space for our suitcases. There was also a small table and chairs as well as a desk with a TV. I have to mention that the lighting in the room wasn't great, there were two bedside lamps plus a floor lamp and a light in the hallway, which was nice to create ambiance but considering we travelled in the winter when the days were short it would have been nice to have brighter lights. A small compliant, however it wouldn't stop me from recommending this hotel nor staying there again. The room and bathroom were clean and tidy, our fridge didn't work but we were out almost all day so we didn't need it anyway. If you book at ths hotel do be sure to check that your room does not join to the room next door - the walls are very thin and unfortunately we had very noisy neighbours that woke us in the night with their loud, drunken conversations. All in all this is a nice, well priced hotel in an excellent location. The area isn't too noisy but a short walk will take you into a shopping area and the metro will take you anywhere in Berlin. The room was a good size, the bed comfortable and the staff left a small box of chocolates outside every door on the day we checked out too which was very sweet!!

Complimentary shower gel shampoo conditioner and body lotion. Loved the mirror in the bathroom which steamed up except for a section at eye level! There were bath robes and slippers for use too. Our room was very quiet and at the correct temperature. The window also opened to allow fresh air. We had breakfast in the roof top restaurant overlooking the gardens. The usual bacon sausage eggs scrambled and boiled. You could order omelette mushrooms pancakes fried eggs etc although they were slow they were worth the wait. Also bread cheese ham meats fresh pineapple strawberries melon and cakes. The first two days were great but the last morning we arrived at 8.30am to find there was no bacon or eggs no bread rolls or ham or pineapple. I guess they had been busy! We requested more food but the staff were useless. The 'chef' kept disappearing in the lift to the restaurant downstairs and reappearing with 2 rashers of bacon? If we had of paid for the upgraded I would certainly be looking for a refund. We had an evening meal in the street level restaurant which was really nice. Homemade burger and hand cut chips which worked out to nearly \u00a310 but well worth it and a dessert that was almost too atractive to eat! Top class service. We used the bar on the ground floor one night but it was too smokey the second night. The guy on reception was helpful with maps directions and taxis. We left our bags at reception after checkout. When we came back from our morning out and collected our bags the guy managed to drop my hand luggage..........luckily the glass inside didnt break. After telling them to be careful with it I would expect better from a hotel of 4 star.

(I had written to them) We had a lovely room with Red Roses and rose petals, roses and candles also in the bathroom. Coffee could be ordered at any time at no charge, but I would still prefer the coffee maker in the room. A charming girl turned down the bed each night and left little sweets. The Hotel was very convenient to the underground and very near the famous store Ka De We. We were there for a week and spent the first 3 days on walking tours which were excellent. On the Saturday we went up the main shopping street near the hotel, there was a great buzz. The tour group Berlin Original Walking Tours were very informative, they also run a Pub Crawl and nothing would do but for my husband to go on it. So off we went with all the young backpackers including a young lad from our home town in Ireland. (Could you go anywhere without meeting someone from home?) Now when I tell you my husband has just retired and it was our 43rd wedding anniversary we were celebrating, you might wonder how we got on. It was FANTASTIC great fun lovely people and the night club at the end of the night!!!! The next day (3o\u2019clock) all we were able for was the long promised visit to the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. That is something not to be missed and you need a good few hours to take it all in. It really gives you food for thought.

Excellent location, 5 minutes walk from the Wittenbergplatz tube station, and right on the corner of the Kurfurstendammstrasse (the main shopping area, with the huge department store KaDeWe on it). As it was a weekend, the hotel dining room was very busy on Sat/Sun morning, and too small for the number of guests trying to get around the buffest tables, but it was fine on the Monday. The breakfast selection was excellent, with a wide choice to suit all tastes and appetites. The staff were very friendly, though rushed. The Germans haven't embraced our hatred of smoking yet, so the very nice (though small) bar was a smoking area, with no alternative no-smoking facility. Also, as usual in an hotel, the drinks were not exactly cheap, so we bought wine from the nearby supermarket after the 1st night, and kept it in the room fridge. The room was small but had everything we needed, cleaned each day, comfy beds, but awful pillows, we had 2 each, and they were useless - far too thin. Upon arrival at Schonefeld Airport, don't pay E30 for a taxi, take the S9 train to Warschauerstrasse (big station), then the tube to your own tube station. This costs E2.10, lasts 2 hours, but we bought a 3 day ticket for E19.90 each, for travel on all Berlin public transport, which was very good value. However, everything is a lot closer than it appears on the map, and we did a lot of walking, with plenty of watering holes to keep us refreshed. The city bus tour, costing about E20, was very informative, and helped you get your bearings, and work out what you wanted to see. You can get on and off whenever you want, to save on the shoe leather. Lots to see and do in this city, loads of museums, the Checkpoint Charlie one is a must. Be aware that there are large queues for the most popular attractions, such as the Reichstag, the Television Tower, so go early. The street food stalls and bakeries are plentiful and good value, and the food is of a very high standard, the Germans all ate at them, so we did too. Overall, a good hotel, if you don't mind smoking, and a very good weekend break.", "Date": "November 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cBetter than current Western presidents!\u201d", "Author": "Acting_ability", "ReviewID": "UR5931282", "Content": "Excellent.

The TV was adequate. The free coffee machine just down from our room was excellent, particularly when we discovered the close proximity of the hotel to the local supermarkets. There were also some good restaurants nearby. The hotel staff were v friendly and most obliging and spoke English. The buffet breakfast was a bit expensive at \u20ac14.00 per person, but there was plenty of it. The fitness centre was a bit shoddy, but everything worked. The hotel does have an '80s feel to it, but it is clean, safe and welcoming. All four of us agreed it was worth staying at again.
