The biggest problem is that when we checked in they gave us a key to a room and when we entered that room, there was somebody already there...imagine how embarrassing was that!! we didn't know how to get out of there sooner! at the reception...they gave us a very stupid explication and after quite a while we got another room near the sauna and the restaurant, which I am pretty sure it was a single room, because when we came in, the cleaning lady came and put another blanket on the bed...all night long you could hear this noise, like a motor which kept me awake and let's not talk about the pillows. Too bad for the bed, who was pretty great... The room was very small, and so was the bathroom sink, I kept on wetting my clothes while washing my face... For the mistake about the room we received a voucher for one drink at the hotel restaurant if we buy something to eat...one...not even two....and only if we eat there...the TV in not a plasma, it's an old TV...and you could hear it in the bathroom..... We had a fridge...wasn't quite working and the electric kettle was full of some kind of rust... As a good part, it is near a lot of Berlin's attractions and has a super market near and the internet was ok.

Lots of variety at the breakfast buffet. The hotel has a good bar and restaurant. The menu is not extensive but the prices were moderate and the food was good. The only real negative was that we had to worry about whether or not we would get a table to ourselves at breakfast although breakfast is served from 6:30 till 10:30. The dining area was always crowded and the personnel did not always clean up after their guests quickly enough to accommodate others who were just coming to eat. It was only at breakfast that you felt you were sharing the hotel with others! All in all we liked staying in the hotel because of the location.

Nice Hotel and nice room, not very far from all Berlin attractions. Very well served by tram and U-bahn. Public transport in Berlin is great. If you go around a lot buy a day ticket. Room very clean and quiet. Only problem can be the small wardrobe, but I was alone and it was fine for me. Quiet residential area. Payed 70,00 euros per night, double room/single use. No breakfast. I think they charge 15,00. Just opposite the hotel there is a backery where you can have breakfast for 3,00 euros. Many other chances around. The hotel has a good restaurant and air conditioning in every room, VERY important if you are in Berlin during a hot summer. I chose this hotel after looking around a lot and I would go there again.

Very modern and comfortable with excellent facilities and very helpful staff. I think the hotel must have gone through a recent re-furb as everything was of very high and modern standard. Our room was very comfortable stocked with a reasonable minibar. The bathroom was great - glass wash basin and \"wet room\" shower. Breakfast was amazing, if you're like me and a lover of food, you can't complain about the choice on offer. Far better than other continental hotels that only offer cold meats and bread! Here you can have anything you like! And as much as you wish! The location was great too, in the Mitte area, where there are pleanty of funky bars and restaurants. Check out the Spar food market next door to the hotel, where we bought cheap bottles of beer and wine and stored them in our minibar fridge!!!!! Can't wait to go back to this hotel - I recommend it highly!", "Date": "July 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2617889", "Content": "We stayed at the Ramada prior to running the Berlin marathon last month and the hotel was excellent.
