{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A bargain! My wife and I stayed at Hotel El Greco during our most recent visit to Mexico City. This hotel is everything that a 2.5 star hotel should be. It is conveniently located at Eje 5, right in between Coyoacan and La Condesa and not too far from El Zocalo. You can walk to restaurants, movie theaters, and shops. The rooms are simple, clean, and have very comfortable beds. The bathrooms have been renovated recently. The hotel also has free internet wireless service throughout. The small caf\u8305 downstairs serves great coffee and pastries. Finally, the staff is very friendly, knowledgeable, and quick to find any information regarding travels through Mexico as well as very safe taxi service, something you want to have access to while staying in Mexico City. The only drawback of this hotel is the street noise, which can be avoided by requesting a room away from the street. For about $50 a night, this hotel is a bargain. I highly recommend it.", "Date": "Nov 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR587398849", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "pantagenet"}, {"Content": "Good value, good location We stayed at the Hotel El Greco in June 2007 and were surprised how clean the rooms were, the beds were comfortable, the linen was changed every day and the staff were very friendly. However, hardly any english is spoken here. We paid 54.00 CDN for a large room with 2beds, sitting area with table and chairs, a big bathroom, big windowsto the street. A bit noisy at times but better than the rooms to the back, there is nothing but walls to look at. A few steps to the Metrobus at Insurgentes Sur. Made several long distance calls to Canada and was only charged 10 dollars for all of them. No hidden fees here. A great place for the budget minded traveler.", "Date": "Jul 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR328167825", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "JaimeVancouver_BC"}, {"Content": "Homey and Friendly! When travelling I don't plan to spend much time in my hotel room. But the time I spend there has to be restful and meet my needs. Plain and simple with a few amenities is enough. However, for a hotel in its price range, the El Greco offers more. It may have some years on it, but as I understand it is much improved due to the influence of the World Trade Mart and other upscal properties in the general vicinity. And the new owners continue in their improvement efforts. The whole week I was a guest, there were workers busy everyday. It goes without saying the location is ideal for so many things and it is the only economical alternative towards the southern side of Mexico City (San Angel, Coyoacan, University City). Staff are friendly and helpful, although hardly any English is spoken. I would not hesitate to stay there again.", "Date": "Dec 15, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR555126924", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Clean, inexpensive and great location This hotel is a good choice if you are looking for simple and inexpensive accomodations. Is is a few block south of the World Trade Center and one block from the central avenue of Insurgentes- a relative safe location. This old hotel, with it's single 4-people elevator resembles a Motel-6.", "Date": "Jun 28, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR738457592", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d184976-r11032696-Hotel_El_Greco-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "184976", "Price": "$18"}}
