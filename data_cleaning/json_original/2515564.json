We jogged every morning along the beachfront, the scenery is amazing and the opportunity to see dolphins every day surfing with the surfers. We stayed in April 2012 and the weather behaved for the most part! So back to the hotel. I would probably classify this as more of a beach motel rather than a hotel. We booked the room with a kitchen and dining area. We cooked indoors several times (smoke detector VERY sensitive so open the windows but at least you know you are safe!)... we also used the BBQ next to the heated pool and lovely hot tub. Our daughter enjoyed the pool each night and morning and as these were cooler times of day, showed that the pool is well heated to enjoy in any kind of weather. The bed was comfortable as was the sofa bed. Our room was cleaned daily. The shower was nice and again, the bathroom was cleaned daily. Not sure it matters to anyone but there was no bath. That certainly does not spoil a vacation for us but thought it worth a mention. There was a little mildew in the bathroom and this was probably due to the lack of ventilation. Not anything to write home about but some guests may find it an issue. You can tell there has been some renovation and as another reviewer said, it still a work in progress. The staff were very helpful with our questions about getting to Legoland, the zoo, seaworld etc. I recommend you get a copy of the bus schedules as we bought all day passes for $2.75 and went all over. We bussed it to Seaworld and back again. We went partway to Legoland by bus and Amtrak..... amazing passenger services. We ate out a few times, there is a lot of choice and the seafood is obviously good!! My only issue was the noise from the room above. I am not really a light sleeper but whoever was up there paced back and forth loudly and well into the early hours. It disrupted our sleep most nights unfortunately. I cannot blame the hotel but it was pretty bad if I am making a negative comment about it. Not sure what could be done, when we are staying above another room we make a conscious effort to tread quietly and certainly ensure our daughter isn't bounding about. Unfortunately not everyone is considerate and it did cause us upset. We did not complain as again, it's not really the hotels fault. Other than that, the location is why we chose this place. A great place for the young crowd, surfing then clubbing.. lots of pubs and clubs, lots of skateboarders too. A great atmosphere. We travelled from San Diego by Amtrak to Anaheim after our stay and saw a lot of great coastal places to stay in California. If you have not been, why not start here at Pacific Beach? I would recommend the Beach Haven Inn for sure, BBQ's around the pool, access to the beach and eateries... friendly service... great value.", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liberal, Kansas, United States", "Title": "\u201cBeach get-away\u201d", "Author": "Jan B", "ReviewID": "UR128463134", "Content": "Great area!

It was one of the less inexpensive hotel on Pacific beach. The area is fun with lots of bars, caters to a younger crowd. But this hotel needed some serious updating. Our check-in took forever. 50 minutes. The person checking us in was running around doing other things at the same time, and telling us really useless information, like the city wanted to install parking meters on the street in the future. Really? We're only staying a few days. The rooms were not very clean. The beds seemed ok, but the shower really needed some work. I didn't want to look too closely at the shower seams, because there was some black stuff there. We were with friends who had another room, and they said they had a real gnats problem. We were told our rooms were \"updated\", so I'd hate to see what the non-updated rooms looked like. FYI, the room did not look \"updated\" at all, unless what they meant by updating was to paint it and put a new mirror on the wall. However, the beds were comfortable, and seemed clean. There is no \"continental breakfast\" as was stated-- it's just hot water and coffee. Most motel places will at least give you a packaged roll or an apple. When we stayed it was really noisy at night. Not the hotel's fault because it is on Pacific Beach, but something you may want to be aware of. Our door was broken so we couldn't open it from the inside (uh, fire hazard!). Our friends had to let us out of our own room. They did fix it the next day though. The rooms are quite cramped. Not much shelving space to put your stuff down. Obviously, I was not paying for 5 stars, but I did have the minimal standards of cleanliness and efficient service.

Check-in involved an uncomfortable 20-minute interrogation with the manager about why I was in town and what I was planning on doing in the room.

Luckily, Expedia was helpful with this and the matter eventually got resolved. 3.

Again, even though it was none of his business, I explained that our friend was just meeting us there and we were on our way to the beach.

I really enjoyed my stay at Beach Haven Inn. I live in Orange County and sometimes I like to get away for a day or two in Pacific Beach. Next time I will be staying at Beach Haven Inn because I have stayed there twice and both times, the visit was very delightful. The staff is very kind and accomodating. From checkin to checkout, the vibe was very comfortable and this made the hotel feel like home away from home. Both suites we stayed in had a very exquisite style to them. I love the colors, curtains and dark wood canopy style beds. The courtyard is cool with a pool, jacuzzi and barb-q surrounded by palm trees. The resturants, boardwalk and beach are all steps away. I am happy its not too expensive, so I can come back very soon.", "Date": "July 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "arizona", "Title": "\u201cWe loved the Beach Haven Inn!!\u201d", "Author": "ronnie431", "ReviewID": "UR17623636", "Content": "My family and I stayed July 4th weekend at Beach Haven Inn.

Knowing we would have lots of visitors, we book a two room suite at the Beach Haven Inn. Pacific Beach is a little funky in places and we are comfortable with that. We were not comfortable with what we found in our \u201csuite\". Upon entering we saw a stained, cigarette burned sofa bed that I chose not to sit on or touch. Checking out the bedroom we discovered that the queen bed took up over 95% of the room. Since it was a four poster bed with rails for a canopy (minus the fabric) it was almost impossible to squeeze between the wall and the foot of the bed to reach the other side so we spent the weekend crawling over each other to get in and out and trying to avoid the stained, cigarette burnt blankets. I ended up with a rash everywhere my skin was exposed to the sheets. The kitchen was another special surprise. The faucet was functional although it was missing its handle. We had no ice bucket for the ice machine and resorted to using the carafe from the coffee pot since it didn't work. The original built in mini fridge was rusted and broken and had been replaced with a new fridge which was the only new thing in the whole unit. The glasses, silverware and dishes in the cub bard and drawers were not what you would consider clean. The some of the amenities in the bathroom were partially used.
