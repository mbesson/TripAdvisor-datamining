This place is fantastic & I have absolutely no negative comments. We called ahead on Friday noon to see if we could get an early check-in so we could empty the cars before the show registration. When we arrived about 30 minutes later, our room was ready & check-in was easy and quick. Several families were looking for rooms without a reservation and despite being sold out, the staff made several calls to assist them. Very convenient location on the yellow route with restaurants close by, car wash across the street, and a nice mini-putt course next door. Breakfast was exceptional, adequate times, well supplied and very clean. Evening hot cobblers with ice cream & cookies was well received and a very nice touch. We needed quarters for the car wash & there were no questions about what they were for and a roll was readily provided. Lauri the manager was very friendly, highly organized, and a very hard worker as she was always on the go helping guests. Rooms were very clean with soft towels and good AC units. Shower had sufficient pressure and spray. Cleaning staff was very friendly & all had a nice word to say to guests. Pool was very nice and area kept clean. Yard and parking areas were well maintained & clean. The pictures for this motel do not do it justice and more should be added to better show the great amenities. Price was very reasonable considering all the amenities, cleanliness, and friendly atmosphere. I will definitely stay here again during the show next year.
