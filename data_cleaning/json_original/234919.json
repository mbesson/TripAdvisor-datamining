I wanted something cozy, with character and charm, where there would be a nice old-fashioned Christmas vibe. Also wanted a convenient location. The Honigmond was everything I hoped for and more. I knew from the moment I entered my room and saw a chocolate Santa on my pillow that I was in the right place! My room was very small but darling and comfortable (and I was really only there to sleep and shower), and the bathroom was recently done and lovely. My young-adult sons shared a room across the hall that was quite spacious. Rooms boast wood floors, high ceilings, chandeliers, ornate mirrors, and antique-look furniture; each room is unique. The front desk staff was welcoming and helpful, and the lobby, with its two (faux) fireplaces and comfy furniture, was a nice place to sit and grab a beer or glass of wine, available on an \"honor system\" (just sign the book to say what you've taken). We especially loved the adjoining restaurant. Breakfast was included in our room rate and was very typically German; the breads, rolls, and homemade jams were wonderful. We ate dinner there twice and the food was marvelous. Love the lit tapers on every table (even at breakfast). A very short walk to Nordbahnhof; hop on a train and get anywhere--or just walk to wherever you're going--nothing seemed too far. If you are looking for deluxe chain-hotel ambience and services, look elsewhere, but those places are a dime a dozen. The Honigmond is one of a kind. I hope to go back someday.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cCharming hotel\u201d", "Author": "stephane75009", "ReviewID": "UR122196600", "Content": "Great charming hotel in the center of Berlin.

The hotel's origins date to 1920 but it was rebuilt after being destroyed in the war so it's not decrepit by any manner of means. Breakfasts are substantial enough but a bit on the plain side - not the best muesli I've seen, unappealing scrambled eggs in various forms, so-so sausages. However the bread and croissants were very good and the salmon was fresh, as were the boiled eggs. In the rooms, the bathroom is top-notch with quality shower, sink, lights and tiling. The mattress was very comfortable but the pillow was a large square one - yeuch. And the curtains could have done with being lined to block out at least some of the light.

However the weather was hot and sunny and with no A/C or blinds on the large windows this made the room so hot at night that sleeping became difficult.

Located on a quiet residential street in Mitte, it is just 2 blocks from restaurants, cafes and quirky shops (art galleries, clothes designers, retro furniture) and another couple of minutes from the Museum Island and Unter den Linden. The reception is cosy and welcoming ('though a little overheated for our taste). There are 2 extremely comfortable seating areas with an honesty bar and furnished with guidebooks, international newspapers and coffee table books/magazines about german style and design. The staff are helpful but not intrusive. Everyone (reception, cleaners, waiting staff at breakfast) has a cheerful 'Guten Tag' and 'Tschuss'. We booked an apartment which was \u20ac200 per night including breakfast. It (A3) was to the rear of the hotel overlooking the courtyard. The lift only serves the ground, 1st and 2nd floors. We were on the 3rd and had to climb a further flight of stairs. Anyone with mobility problems (or who doesn't feel like climbing) should make sure their room is accessible. There was no porter. The main room was spacious and well furnished having sufficient storage etc. The bed end was a bit dark - but we were out all day and it meant that the room was blacked out at night for better sleeping. It was also unseasonably warm during our stay and the room was lovely and cool. The bed was large and really comfortable - as often found on the continent, it had 2 separate mattresses and duvets. The bathroom was fully tiled and had a bath and shower. It was clean and definitely big enough for 2 people to use at once. Shower/Bath gel was provided but nothing else. The kitchen was equipped with a hob, an oven, fridge-freezer etc. but no washing up liquid or basic condiments etc. A welcome basket would have been pleasant; those items should be automatically provided. That would sum up our only quibble - there was an extra touch that was missing in some areas even though it was provided in others. The breakfast was gargantuan. Served in the Honigmond restaurant downstairs till 11am, the buffet tables were replenished constantly. Cereal, breads, cheese, eggs, salads, ham, smoked fish, fruits, yoghurts......the list goes on. Delicious and enough to keep you going till mid afternoon cake! Try the restaurant for dinner - the Klopsche (meatballs in caper sauce) are well worth it. Be warned though: the portions are really enormous and sharing one three-course meal between 2 would do most people! It is excellent value but eating out in Berlin is generally.
