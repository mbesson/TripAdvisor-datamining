Great places to walk around to in this old part of town. We stayed in suite 504 which is in attached annex on the third floor of a cute narrow marble spiral staircase. The 2 bdr suite was luxurious and beautifully renovated-as nice as pics. Being in an old building, the walls were thin and I was constantly telling my three kids to stop making noise. The breakfast was good and fresh. They had that amazing yougurt, boiled eggs, dried fruits, some fresh fruit, amazing homemade jams, bread, cheeses, olives, and some cereal. They charge extra 7 TL for fresh orange juice and 10TL for an omlette, but we never felt the need to get the extras as the food was adequate. If you are staying more than 5 days, you might get tired of it, but for the five of us it was perfect. I only wish they kept the coffee pot outside somewhere so we can get refills on our own and not disturb the staff every 5 minutes. I also wish they offered it till 11 am and not 10:30 am. I must say that we were always late getting there and they always kindly waited for us even tough they were supposed to end it at 10:30. This is the only time you can have your complimentary tea/coffee and food. I've discovered that one afternoon when I was waiting with sleeping baby (can't carry stroller up 3 flights of stairs, so they were very kind and kept it in lobby for us) to wake up. I ordered tea around 5 pm and was charged 5 TL. So tea is not complimentary in the lobby (you have it in your room for free). Also, the advertised 5 o'clock tea/wine in the lobby is not complimentary. The people were always kind and helpful, and even though they never said anything about our 3 loud kids, I felt that we would of been more at ease at a hotel with an elevator, pool and larger lobby for the kids ( and probably thicker walls). This is a unique, beautiful and really well maintained family run boutique hotel that I loved and wish I could return without little ones in tow. It is also more romantic than anything. I was told The Orient Express is an option if you have kids under 5.

The room itself was a good size, which from what I've heard isn't so easy to come by when staying in Sultanahmet, and the bathroom was very clean and nicely equipped. We also had a small balcony overlooking the cobblestone street out front, that made for some nice people watching before bed in the evening. When we arrived we were greeted by a friendly face at the front desk, who we ended up seeing there throughout most of our stay. He gave us a lay of the land, suggested some local attractions for us to visit and, to our great relief, provided us with two plug converters to use during our stay, after we had mistakenly left ours at our previous hotel. When I say that the hotel's location was perfect, I really can't stress how true this is. Everything that a tourist in Istanbul would want to see was within a very easy walking distance, and if you wanted to venture out, like we did, the tram stops are easy to get to, and the Metro system is very easy to navigate. Something else to note is that the Hotel Sari Konak (like most of the hotels we stayed in) provides a yummy Turkish breakfast on the rooftop deck, every morning. Its such a lovely way to start the day. And if you do as much sightseeing as we did in Istanbul, you will definitely need the fuel!

When we arrived at the hotel we were offered a free breakast while we were waiting for our room to be ready which was really appreciated after our long flight. One of the reasons I chose this hotel was because of the view of the Blue Mosque from their roof terrace and it didn't disappoint. Its absolutely amazing up there. The breakfast is a typical Turkish breakfast and gives you a good start to the day. Our room was spacious and larger than we had booked. Our adult daughter joined us so they gave us a room with 2 seperate bedrooms, kitchen/dining area and lovely bathroom with hamen bath. The room was partly below ground which didn't detract any light from the rooms. It was not overly quiet but I am sure there are other rooms which would offer a quiet sleep. We didn't mind as the space suited our needs this time. There is a computor for guest use which we found very handy. The location is fantastic, better than I imagined. It is extremely close to all the major sights and right next to lovely restaurants. We really enjoyed our first stay in Istanbul and the Sari Konak played a big part in this.

Most importantly, my parents were very comfortable there and we all enjoyed our stay. Hotel is very well located in the Sultanahmet area of the city. As a second-time visitor to Istanbul, I probably would have stayed in a different neighborhood, but for first-time visitors (my parents) interested in seeing the three main sites, you really can't go wrong. Loads of cafes and tourist restaurants in the immediate vicinity and a 5 minute walk to the Blue Mosque. My parents' room was in the new wing and was quite spacious and comfortable for them. They were particularly pleased with the huge bed and the ample counter space in the bathroom for their things. My room was in the older section of the room and was fairly spartan and small, but comfortable enough and, in the end, exactly what I'd paid for. The real pleasure of the hotel, however, is the staff who work in the breakfast area and at the front desk. They could not have been more helpful, patient, and kind with all three of us. It seemed as if they'd never been asked the questions we asked -- their answers to us were as complete and generous as they must have been to the hundreds of other visitors who'd asked the same questions. They really seemed to want us to enjoy our stay, helped with booking transport for us, suggesting restaurants, and so on. Breakfast was a treat as the room faces the rear of the hotel and is quite bright and sunny in the mornings. Plenty of choices on offer (I particularly liked the thick yogurt, to which I added wonderfully plump walnuts, honey and dried figs) and an attentive staff re-filling bowls and making sure everything was just right.

It so happened that a number of friends and acquaintances were in town at the same time, so I received a number of phone calls. The gentlemen at the desk took messages for me and even helped me relay messages to my friends since I was out most of the day. They made recommendations for restaurants which were spot on. As a single woman, I felt extremely safe. As a guest, you leave your key with the hotel, so they are aware of any inconsistencies and you do not lose your key. They lock the door at midnight, which I found a bit embarrassing when I stayed out late a few times, but I also found it very reassuring. There is a young man whose job it is to stay up and let the guests in when they ring the bell. I am a germaphobe and the hotel is very clean. I would stay there again in a heartbeat, but more likely if I am traveling as a couple than as a single again.

This was spacious, clean and very comfortable. The breakfast in the morning is plentiful but if you want freshly squeezed orange juice then there is an extra charge for it (4 Euros)! I was a little disappointed at this as this is not a cheap hotel to stay in. The hotel is less than ten minutes walk to all main local tourist attractions - Blue Mosque, Saint Sofia, Topkapi Palace, Gulhane Park. The hotel is very close to the tram. It is very cheap and easy to use. Use it and save on taxi fares! Overall, we all enjoyed our stay at the hotel. I had booked this hotel as a special treat for my 72 year old mother. The hotel was slightly on the pricey side but worth it. Would I stay at this hotel again? Probably not. Although a lovely hotel it is slightly overpriced - there is no gym or swimming pool.

What a way to build trust! \"Don't worry, he said. Just pay us back when you get a chance to change money.\" They always treated us like family. Our room was clean and tidy but smaller than appeared on the hotel web site. We had a room facing the street which was a little noisy at times (e.g. 2am garbage pickups) but not unbearable. There was nothing much we could do about the round the clock call to prayers but I have to admit that I missed them after we left Istanbul. The rooftop breakfasts with panoramic views of the Sea of Marmara and breathtaking views of the Blue Mosque were the highlight of our stay. We got to know the local seagulls on a first-name basis and they, in turn, kept at a respectful distance while eyeing our delicious morning repast with positive anticipation.

The terrace (used for breakfasts and as a bar for the rest of the day) was very scenic with the blue mosque and ayia sofia directly behind). Other reviewers have said that the breakfast was great, but for the price I would say that the breakfast was the only thing that let it down- there was not a lot of choice and found out that they charged for orange juice (although it was fresh)- however I do not want to over complain about this as food in turkey is always to a decent standard- although with a little effort they could improve on the brekkie. The rooms were very clean and the beds/linen etc all good. I would definitely reccommend this hotel for the fact that its location makes a great base to explore Istanbul. We were first timers to the place however it was not hard to spot that the restaurants around the direct vicinity of the hotel were not as good as those outside of sultanahmet- however prices are not that expensive generally.

The only thing I would say about these hotels is that they are period properties and therefore anyone that has difficulties with stairs probably should make sure they get a room next to the elevator (old style) as there are lots of landings and half landings which require going up and down steps.

The bathroom was spotless and had a convenient tub/shower. The breakfasts of fruit, yogurt, cereal, meats, cheeses, and breads were fresh, healthy, and substantial enough that we usually skipped lunch. The hotel's location is between the Blue Mosque and Aya Sofya and about a 5-minute walk from the main tram line that connects to Karakoy, Eminomu, and other areas a tourist is likely to want to visit. The hotel's relatively small size (17 rooms) gave it a quiet, cozy feel that was extremely relaxing. Finally, a computer with free internet access and a printer for guests made it convenient to check emails without going through all the hassles (and extra fees) I've encountered at many \"high end\" hotels in the States. (Also, I didn't need to pack a laptop.) In short, the Sari Konak satisfied all our needs in a hotel. The two best features of the hotel, however, were the friendly staff and the rooftop terrace. The Okun family, along with Mustafa and Oktay at reception, and Hasan on the terrace, really made us feel welcome and were extremely helpful with restaurant suggestions and other arrangements. The rooftop terrace offered amazing views of the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya, and the sea. One of the highlights of our trip was the chance to sit on the terrace and enjoy a drink at the end of the day, watching ships entering and leaving the Bosphorus, listening to the call to prayer from the Blue Mosque, and chatting with Hasan and with other guests. We can't wait to go back! One small practical suggestion: plan ahead to pay your bill in cash, in view of the 10% discount offered by the hotel for cash payments.

We'd brought our laptop and wireless service from our room was spotty, but we had a great connection from the sitting room downstairs and it was a very comfortable area to do emailing, etc. From our patio to the right we could see the Blue Mosque clearly. Although the rooftop terrace was closed during our stay (offseason), we were permitted to visit the terrace and enjoy the view. In the summer months this terrace would be spectacular. Although the breakfast buffet menu did not vary during our stay, the selection was great. I was able to try something new each morning. I especially liked the yogurt with all sorts of toppings available (nuts, granola, jams, apricots, figs, etc)The coffee was very good and plentiful. At our request, reception arranged various tours for us and were able to accomodate our often last minute requests for the Dervish show, Bosphorous cruise, Turkish bath, and other things. They were extremely helpful. We found one guide, a woman named Ozgu, especially vibrant and informative. The hotel arranged our tours with her company and we were fortunate enough to have Ozgu as our guide for all three of our half day tours. The only downside to one of the half day tours was the \"carpet demonstration\" that turned out to be a rather aggressive sales pitch. I would rather have spent more time at one of the museums. Our other tours with the same company did not include this. We also had our best meal at the recommendation of the hotel at Hamdi Restaurant near the Spice Market. Excellent food , unparalleled view and quite reasonably priced. This hotel is ideally situated for tourists to explore the city. With the exception of our trip to the airport, we never needed a cab! We reached the Grand Bazaar, Spice Bazaar, Whirling Dervish show, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, Topkapi Palace and numerous decent restaurants all on foot. The weather is December was variable: we were fortunate to have several days of sun but there were some rainy days, too. I would visit off season again in a heartbeat due to the complete lack of crowds and lines.

I used Trip Advisor and several other websites to narrow the field, settling on the Sari Konak because of its good reviews. What a great choice we made! Not only was the location perfect for sightseeing, shopping, dining, and experiencing local charm, but the staff was exceptional. We booked two rooms, one for our grown children (a standard room which was small, but adequate) and a deluxe room for ourselves. While we had to navigate two flights of narrow stairs to reach our room (#604), it was the only room on that floor, so we had complete privacy, with windows looking over the quiet street behind the hotel. Very spacious, with a king size bed and three large easy chairs, our family gathered comfortably in our room when the weather kept us indoors. The bathroom was state of the art modern, with lots of hot water and lovely soaps to take the chill out of the dreary days. Even the towels smelled wonderful! We would meet for breakfast in the mornings...a nutricious and colorful spread awaited us in the dining room. The coffee was delicious, and the selection of foods was satisfying for everyone in the family, even our picky eaters. If we needed help with our daily excursions, the staff was more than willing to give us directions, guidance, and advice. It was wonderful to know that our hotel was so close to most of the major sights that we could return to the hotel to go to the bathroom, rest our feet, or get warm. Our room was always immaculately made up when we returned, and we never had to wait for the maids to service our rooms, as happens in American hotels. With only a small staff, they manage to keep the hotel spotlessly clean, and every employee takes pride in running a quality establishment. In short, the Sari Konak is a delightful place to lay your head.

Frustrated, we left the hotel and had breakfast elsewhere, deducting the cost from our final bill. Which was taken with much ill grace.

We spent three nights in Room 502, which is the two bedroom apartment. It was really spacious and lovely. The rooms had AC which was great because it was really hot while we were there. My only small complaint would be that there was a bit of mildew in the bathroom shower, but I've seen worse. Mustafa at the front desk was funny and charming and helpful. Really, all the staff were really nice and friendly. The hotel has a GREAT rooftop deck with views of the blue mosque. One night, we bought beer up there and hung out, but on another night, the front desk said that they might not be able to serve us beer on the rooftop, and they suggested we go to the little store aroudn the corner and buy some, which we did. We spent a great rest of the evening on the rooftop, listening to the call to prayer and just generally relaxing. Breakfast is really nice and there's a small courtyard with four tables of four. Our last night, we moved to 503, which was the other apartment. It's a bit honeymoon suite-esque as the bedroom is really large. There's a living area attached to a kitche, which is a nice feature. They put a cot in the living room for me which was fine.

We got scammed pretty badly because we didn't know how much the taxi fare would be at one point. Always check that the meter is on before you go anywhere.

But I don't know what I would have done if the nice people at the hotel hadn't helped me. Not only are the people at the Sari Konak great, but so is the hotel itself. The location is perfect. It is just a couple minutes away from the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, and Topkapi Palace. The view from the hotel roof is incredible. You have a clear, beautiful view of the Blue Mosque. My blue mosque pictures from that roof are some of the best from my trip. The rooms are nice, too. The air conditioning saved my life in the summer heat.

We originally booked the Four Seasons Sultanhamet at $490 Euro per night. After much discussion, we decided we wanted a more authentic experience and chose the Sari Konak in Sultanhamet as our base. We booked suite 503 which is the largest room at the hotel. The rate was $159 Euro per night including taxes and breakfast (we had breakfast one morning and it was fine...yogurt, cheese, olives, bologna/mortadella, dried fruits, cereal and breads). The hotel provided complimentary transfer to the hotel from the airport which was perfect after the overnight flight. The driver was waiting and helped with luggage. Check in was easy and we had assistance to our room up a small staircase in the hotel's newer building. The suite was good sized, bright and generally in good shape. The rooms were decorated in a pleasing cream and beige palette as shown on the web site. The entry was wide and had a desk and two chairs which came in handy to store our purchases and coats. The couch in the small living room is adequate to rest tired feet but was not all that comfy to \"lounge\"....the cushions are ready for replacement. Three windows made the room bright and cheery and one window opened to allow in fresh air. There was no coffee table to rest drinks or snacks (all those wonderful desserts and turkish pistachios) but we pulled the small kitchen table into the living area and it served us well. There was a small, 20 inch flat screen TV with a few english channels including CNN and BBC which kept us up to date with current news events. The bathroom was small without a tub which was no problem as we prefer showers. The shower stall was equipped with a hand held shower however the shower head bracket did not work properly and did not hold the shower head while the water was on. We have been to many European hotels with this same set-up so while a minor inconvenience, there was no need to complain. Hot water was ok as long as we did not linger in the shower too long as it went from hot to cold back to hot. The shower had a small window that opened for fresh air. Two small, thin bath towels and two hand towels were provided each day and there was a heated towel rack which also served to heat the bathroom. There was mold around the shower base and shower window....while we were a bit put off by that, we didn't feel it warranted complaining...the climate is humid so I suppose mold can be a problem. The bedroom had a padded window seat and while large and decorated with nice fabrics and drapes, did not have adequate storage for a week....there was an armoire with hangers and a large safe (two laptops fit in it) but no other place to store clothes that did not require hanging. The bed was comfortable with a poly filled mattress cover that added a bit more softness. There was a medium sized vanity in the bedroom to store makeup allowing me to get ready while my husband was in the bathroom shaving. Two nightstands on each side of the bed for water and lights for night reading. Two large windows added to the brightness of the room during the day with darkening drapes for evening. The area was very quiet at night and we slept well (until the AM construction started). The small kitchenette was equipped with a tea kettle and an espresso machine as well as dishes, flatware and glasses. There was a mini fridge with a few juices and a bottle of water. We used the espresso machine the first few days until the hotel ran out of coffee pods for the unit which they never did refill even after going to the breakfast room and asking (no in room coffee for last three days). Slightly annoyed with this as we had to dress and go downstairs for that first cup of coffee. Free wireless internet with very fast speed.

She arranged to have a birthday cake in the fridge for my husband as well as fresh flowers in the room (at a charge which I expected). She had the rest of our visit off and it appeared that the staff was stretched thin covering the shifts. Mustafe was great...but he worked day and night so was clearly tired. We didn't require much help other than to turn on the heat in our room or open the locked front door at night so it was not an issue. There was construction going on in the building behind the hotel (appears to be another hotel being installed) and across the street (another hotel being renovated) so there was quite a bit of noise in the mornings. While that would normally bother us, it served as our second wake up call after the first call to prayer (which we really miss - the call to prayer not the construction). There is a small market with items such as cola, water, wine (very expensive and not good) and snacks at the top of the street which was very convenient as the roof top terrace was closed for the season. The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the Blue Mosque and a few more minutes to the tram stop which we found very easy to use (also very inexpensive). There is a street one block from the hotel lined with dining and we would highly recommend Albura.....wonderful food, good service and well priced. We tried the Antique Turquiose on the same street and it was horrible, really horrible....I can't recall a meal that bad in years. Service was equally poor so please save your lira (.... don't believe the gentleman who states u won't pay if u don't like it!!) and walk a few more steps to Albura. You will love the food and service at Albura. We did visit the Four Seasons which was a short walk from the Sari Konak. It is amazingly beautiful and amazingly over priced. We had two cocktails one evening before dinner and it was $90 Lira (two martinis and one cola) which was more than our entire meal with wine at Albura....try the Manti with yogurt/chili sauce. Istanbul is a wonderful place to visit with warm people who are willing to help! I'll never forgot our first few hours on the grounds outside the Blue Mosque, dazed with jet lag but knowing we had to keep going when a young policeman stopped to say hello...upon realizing we were American he asked if he could sit and talk with us (he wanted to practice his english and taught us a few phrases in Turkish)....we spent an hour chatting about cultures and politics....he left us with an offer of help while we were there and told us what days we could find him working and where. What an amazing welcome to a great city. We attended Eveline's Cooking AlaTurka class and had a wonderful meal with equally great conversation followed by a relaxing walk to see her new kitchen and dining spot. She provided her fav spots at the Spice Market and shared the vacuum pack tip which allowed us to bring back many wonderful spices - red pepper, pistachios, salted nuts, lemon salt and more. The new location is a 2 minute walk from the Sari Konak. If you are a foodie, take the class (information posted in the forum). We miss the people we had the good fortune to meet and speak to, the sites, food and the hauntingly beautiful call to prayer. So with all of that (more than a hotel review), we would recommend the Sari Konak to those wanting to stay in Sultanhamet in a very convenient location.

The desk was attended to around the clock, and everyone there spoke very good English. There was also a computer with Internet available for use free of charge. The rooms were small but clean and more than met our needs. From our window, we had a view of the Blue Mosque. If I had to complain, the WC was tucked away in a small space behind the bathroom door. I'm a big guy, you get the picture. Besides that, really no other issues. Breakfast was great, with seating indoors or on the small internal courtyard patio. Cereal, cold cuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, fruit. A great start to every morning. The hotel is literally 5 minutes on foot to the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sofya and the underground cistern. With lots of great little stores, art shops and restaurants along the way. On evenings, the rooftop terrace is the perfect place to relax and chat about the days events over drinks (in our case, several Efes largers) with an unobstructed view of the illuminated Blue Mosque and the Bosphorus. They do serve drinks on the terrace, but it is not manned at all times so you need to inform the front desk if you need service. Conversely, you can just buy what you want from the small convenience store at the corner and go self-serve style. The Hayat Cafe restaurant a block up the street from the hotel is a great stop for lunch or dinner. They serve Turkish food and its pretty tasty and fairly cheap.

I have been to Istanbul twice now, and part of my love of this hotel is influenced by my absolute love of this city and this country. The recent ten days that I spent here were an absolute delight. I settled into my room and it just felt like home. The staff is wonderful, kind, helpful, full of ideas and gently available. The architecture and decor is carefully chosen, warm, attractive. The breakfasts are something to look forward to morning after morning out on the quiet patio, served by lovely staff. The rooftoop terrace has a magnificent view, quiet and breathtaking and all alone at 7 am with views of the Bosphorus and the ships and the Blue Mosque just one block away, or spectacular at sunset or late at night with a drink as the lights of the city and the mosque and minarets and bridges -- oooh, it's too wonderful for words and is a great place to spend your time, all alone, curled up with a book or journal, taking in the sights and sounds, or with your friends. The hotel is located on a lovely and quiet street, with access to plenty of great shops and good restaurants and all the tourist sites of the old town -- 2 blocks from ARasta Bazaar shops, 2 blocks from the Blue Mosque -- I could walk these streets in any direction for days and days. Just explore this wonderful city and it's history and architecture and fabulous people to your hearts content -- there's so much to learn and see and absorb - and then you can always look forward after a long day of exploration to returning to your home at Hotel Sari Konak.

The garden courtyard for breakfast is delightful, and the rooftop deck with panoramic views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosporus is fantastic-enjoy a glass of wine from their bar while watching the sun set and listening to the evening call to prayer. Sublime. What really make the Sari Konak special, though, are the staff. Special thanks to Sergun who repeatedly gave us excellent restaurant recommendations, and facilitated our navigation through Istanbul, including elaborate markings on the complimentary hotel city maps to help us catch ferries to the Asian side of the city for more off the track exploration.

The staff are all caring and sympathetic to the confusion of its foreign guests and enormously knowledgable and helpful. Unlike other hotels in the area, there is no sense that the hotel's secondary purpose is to sell tours or rugs. Because there is no restaurant( except the breakfast patio for guests), the rooftop terrace is a lovely respite at the end of the day, calm and relaxed with a wonderful viiew of the harbour and the Blue Mosque.

We had a triple so we were kind of cramped, and the room was very basic, but we were still very pleased with the accomodations. The terrace was a wonderful relaxing spot with great views. The little garden and breakfast room reminded me of the best of boutique hotels in Paris. The location in Sultanahment is fantastic. The breakfast was one of the best we have had in Europe. Everything about this hotel was just right. Istanbul has enough mystique and charm to rival any European city. Its a magical place, if you can get over the problems with some of the merchants, taxi drivers and locals constantly trying to cheat Western tourists (i.e. a taxi ride to the hotel costs one figure and the exact same taxi ride from the hotel to that location the next day costs one fifth what you paid - I could give twenty more examples, this activity is CONSTANT). It really helps when you stay at a place as lovely as Sari Konak, with a wonderful and kind staff looking after you.", "Date": "April 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "salt lake city, UT", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "AAW67", "ReviewID": "UR7277452", "Content": "Loved the Sari Konak!

The most disappointing was one recommended and arranged by Sari Konak. We were picked-up by the restaurant's owner and taken to his restaurant which was clearly otherwise deserted.

The hotel is attractively furnished and being a converted Ottoman house includes traditional Turkish elements and decoration. We had a room on the first landing quite close to the lobby, I have read some criticism from other reviewers that these rooms are rather noisy, however, the combination of long days of walking, a filling Turkish meal and a couple of glasses of Efes meant that we slept like the proverbial logs and hardly noticed any noise. The room was small but comfortable and adequate for two. To be picky I would have perhaps preferred a bit more storage space for clothes and the wardrobe was a rather close to the bed making it difficult to open the doors fully (the solution was to sit on the bead and open it) but those are really very minor criticisms and were more than outweighed by the other advantages the hotel offers. All the staff we dealt with were exemplary, particularly at breakfast, we were made to feel very welcome and that, had we wished, they would have been more than happy to advise re: sightseeing, restaurants etc... Breakfast itself was an absolute pleasure, homemade cake and preserves, olives, meats, fruit cereals and the most delicious creamy white cheese. For the me the highlight of the hotel was the roof terrace with its wonderful views over the rooftops to the Sea of Marmara one way and through the tress to the Blue Mosque the other.

The walls are paper thin and you can hear every event in the rooms around you. There are no chairs or places to sit except the bed. Our toilet leaked the entire time we were there. On the good side the location is great, although there are at least 6 other hotels in the same block. The breakfast was very nice, as was the rooftop bar. This is the second time that the reviews of a hotel on tripadvisor don't seem to match the actual physical experience of the hotel itself. I hope this isn't a tremd. Honestly, this place is two steps above a hostel and maybe one below a Motel 6. I would think it was just the room we had, but I saw 2 others that friends were staying in, that were nearly the same. Perhaps there are better rooms in the hotel. The disturbing thing is that I made the reservation almost a year in advance for a queen-balcony room. What we got was a tiny room with 3 twin beds (although they very promptly made 2 of the beds into one.) and no balcony. We can't say we were a late arrival, as we checked in at 7am (they were very kind to keep our baggage, while we went sightseeing) even though there would be no room available till 1pm. I can't fault the staff as they were really great. Please be aware that this is not some little jewel of a boutique hotel., Maybe there are some great rooms, but we didn't see them and certainly were not offered an upgrade. I would definitely look for something else in a future trip to Istanbul.", "Date": "October 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Family Run Hotel in Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "Baumgartner", "ReviewID": "UR5955230", "Content": "The Sari Konak Hotel in Istanbul is that small, family run hotel we always look for when we travel to Europe.

Stayed there last year also. Agree with all other reviews that raved about Hotel--we too loved our recent stay there for the reasons cited by others. However, because we stayed in a deluxe room each time, we were unaware of some of the problematic rooms there. The reviewer who gave a low rating because of an unacceptably small room is correct --we saw it and walked through it because it was assigned to a couple we were traveling with. The room was so small that there was barely enough room to step out of the bed. The bathroom was a problem because only a small person could sit on the toilet comfortably. There is no air conditioning or television in the room and, because of its location on a landing just a few steps above the reception desk, all conversations and noise connected with checking in and guests entering and leaving the hotel are easily heard in the room. The rate for this room is the same as for all other regular rooms. The room, thus, was unacceptable and the couple was forced to move to another hotel because the hotel was fully booked. Also, there is one other room that is not air conditioned (the other couple we were traveling with was assigned to that room). The reception desk confirmed that the hotel has two rooms that only have ceiling fans, no air conditioning. Nevertheless, I would still highly recommend this hotel so long as you do not get this teeny noisy room or the other non air conditioned room and are aware that the rooms do vary in size.
