We arrived very late (after midnight) and the front desk staff called me by name - he was waiting for us! We were given an oceanfront room on the 4th floor - parking is in a garage but the spaces aren't tight - so it's good. Our room had a separate bedroom 'cubby' for the kids with bunk beds, desk, television. The beds have their own push on/off lights. The bedroom was a good size - and the balcony was great. Very nice bathroom. Plus everything was super clean! Because we arrived so late, everyone was tired and wanted to sleep in. A call down to the desk got us a late check out (2pm). Excellent!! We went out on the beach to explore and enjoy. Then jumped in the pool. Finally, we ate at the restaurant for a late breakfast. The food was surprisingly tasty - and priced reasonably...especially since kids meals were free! You also get two free drink coupons upon arrival - which we used for our beverages in the morning (coffee/tea/soda). For those that drink, they could be used for alcohol as well. We really enjoyed everything. The hall/bath is tile...the living area is carpeted.

This is true from the great, \"straight-on\" view from the balconies actually facing the ocean (not at an angle) to guest services to the pool to cleanliness to the dining experiences. Our family of four spent 3 nights here in mid-August. There was a certain amount of nostalgia with this stay - growing up, our family always stayed at roadside Holiday Inns, typically 2-story, exterior room access, and large pools. When my boys (12 and 9) saw the pool, they said, \"wow, it's 10 feet deep!\" I explained how hotel pools were in the good ole days! This pool is very large and welcoming. The colorful lights after dark add another element of fun. The hot tub was actually hot and the fire pits added a nice touch. We reserved a Kid's Suite, which had 2 beds and a little nook with a bunk bed for the kids. The nook also had its own lights for each bunk, overhead light and tv. The balcony provided some extra space for sitting and admiring sunrises, waves, beach, starry nights, and evening lightning over the ocean. The room appeared modern and everything was clean and in good working order. There was also a small fridge and small microwave. Wireless Internet worked fine. Beach access was just a few steps down from the pool area. I don't typically eat a lot of meals in hotel restaurants, but the convenience of eating immediately after burning up energy at the beach and pool made it to enticing to not give it a try. I'm glad we did! We didn't eat every meal there (see also reviews soon for Aunt Catfish's restaurant, Medieval Times, and Stavros Pizza), but the breakfasts, lunches, and dinners we did eat were great! The food was tasty and delivered with wonderful service from people like Jose. He is there to truly serve the guests and help them have a great dining experience and stay. Becky, at the front desk, is amazing! She greeted me with a warm smile when I checked in and then somehow remembered my name and face everytime I needed assistance or had a question. I travel a lot for business, spending over 100 nights a year in hotels - Becky truly stands out as a role model for guest services (DJ and others were great also, I just happened to have most contact with Becky). All in all, this was a great stay at a great beachfront hotel. I personally liked that it was a little bit away from the busiest, more crowded areas of the beach and town. I highly recommend it to others and will definitely make it my first choice if I return to Daytona Beach.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful view, great pool, average room\u201d", "Author": "Tisha399", "ReviewID": "UR138089606", "Content": "Pluses: We had a wonderful balcony and ocean view, kids loved the pool and beach.

We just got off a cruise and we were flying out of Daytona. So we thought we would stay at an ocean hotel for our last vacation night. What a nice treat. Check in was quick and easy. We showed up a little early on 7/23 and we were given a room so we could go enjoy the beach. We parked in a garage, which is very nice in the Fl heat. The room was very clean and updated. The beds were comfy. Loved the way the firm and soft pillows are labeled. Nice to have a frig in the beach front room. The bathroom is roomy and very clean, water pressure was good. I think all the rooms are oceanfront which is a plus. Our room was over the parking lot, but we were up high enough that it did not bother me. I still had a great ocean view. The pool area is very nice. My kids loved the pool as well as a ocean. Kids were able to run around the hotel unsupervised. This became annoying when every time we got in the elevator, all the floor numbers were pushed. So we had to stop at every floor when we rode the elevator. We were one of the top floors, so we stopped a LOT. Parents really need to watch their kids. We ate dinner at the hotel. It was just OK. The waitress was very nice. Something happened to their soda machine and they did not have sodas to offer. It was fixed mid meal and she brought my kids soda and swapped out the lemonade that they did not like. The meals were average at best and a bit overpriced. I guess you are paying for the convenience. The business center is 2 computers located in the lobby, right at the entrance door. We had to advance check in for our flight the next day right there in the lobby. Not very private. We had to print off our boarding passes at the front desk. The girls were helpful with getting that done. It was not crowded when we came so there were no issues finding chairs poolside or a parking spot. But this is a pretty big hotel. I could see where there may be a problem when the hotel is booked. Wish there was a free continental breakfast. Overall this is a really nice hotel at a great beach.

We enjoyed our stay so much that we actually extended it the day we were suppose to originally leave, and thanks to Becky, we received a discount for already being in-house guests. The only 2 downfalls were the lack of television channels and the parking. It's like you're always competing with other guests to park on site (which there really isn't enough space for more than 1 vehicle to search for parking at a time) or you'll have to park across the street. Because the shop across the street is abandoned, everyone assumed it was safe to park there, until we asked an employee who told us that they didn't own that lot, but the one next door named Marcos.

The kids loved the pool, which has a small waterfall and I found the lounge chairs very comfortable and readily available. The pool restaurant/ bar also looks nice although we had just one drink and did not eat there since we had kitchen facilities and made our own dinner.

The best bit was the view. Waking up to watch the sunrise over the ocean and dolphins playing in the sea was a great start to the trip! Coming from the UK the idea of driving on the beach is an intriguing one - the beach by the hotel is part that you can drive on, basically this means you have to sit in the surf to not be in the roadway. You need to check for (slow moving) cars at all times and the sand is sooooooooo hard that it's uncomfortable to sit in. However there are plenty of car free parts of the beach so it's fine :-) We had a car and I would definitely recommend going to the Cracked Egg Diner for breakfast, Ponce Inlet for the lighthouse and two amazing waterfront restaurants, and into the town for some antique shopping.

Here were our thoughts: The Good: Aesthetics. The hotel and grounds were nice and very well kept. Room design and furniture were very nice. H20's food was delicious. All hotel staff were very friendly. Plenty of lounge chairs by the pool. Plenty of vendors on the beach (if you like that). It's nice to have a separate pool area for the little kids. Plenty of activities to keep older kids busy. Close to local attractions. Live music on Friday and Saturday. The singer we saw was great. A family member was coming to visit for the day but decided she wanted to stay the night with us. We wanted to be honest, so we let the front desk know and expected them to charge us for her to stay in our room, but they were very nice about it and just let her stay with us. Upon check in, we were given the option of having a room at a higher or lower level. We were able to choose higher, which was nice. The Negative: We booked through hotels.com. The Holiday Inn was offering a better rate with more amenities than the hotel we usually stay at. Seemed easy enough and read all of the fine print. However, after checkout, our credit card was charged an additional amount. We called just to verify everything and it turns out there is a $6/day \"resort fee\"...which we were unaware of. Seems a bit silly as I thought that's what we had already payed for...So with the resort fee and no free breakfast, our previous hotel is actually less expensive. The beach was too crowded for our personal taste. But again, that is personal preference. Same for vendors. While convenient, we prefer to be farther down the beach where it is quieter. Beach traffic. We have a little one who likes to run so keeping him out of traffic was a challenge. We noticed other families having the same issue. Our room was on the far left and had a view of the Economy Inn's pool. That was not the problem. The problem was the Economy Inn's guests being very loud at 10:30-11ish in the p.m. We like to sleep with the door open to hear the ocean but had to close because we couldn't sleep. The hotel offers complimentary drinks upon arrival. We were given a ticket to take to the hotel bar. As we had just gotten in that evening from a long day of traveling, we decided to eat at the restaurant in-house. I had a $25 coupon for the restaurant that I had from restaurants.com. We ordered our drinks and presented the waitress with the ticket. Then ordered our food, keeping in mind that we had a $25 cushion. As we presented her with our coupon with the bill she let's us know that she can't accept it because we can't use 2 coupons in one sitting. I explained this was the only coupon we had to give. She then tells us that our COMPLIMENTARY drinks qualified as the second coupon. I then asked if we could just take off the drink ticket then and use that at a later time since we had upped our food orders with the restaurants.com coupon in mind. She came back about 5 minutes later and said that she couldn't and that she was \"sorry.\" That left a bad taste in our mouth after an exhausting day. Not the best first impression of our new hotel. Please not that the waitress was not rude to us, it was just not good customer/hotel service for that situation. We found it best to enjoy the pool in the morning because by the afternoon it was full. The baby pool area was nice, but the dump bucket in the shallowest part was a bit nerve-wracking for fear of it drenching and knocking down our 17 month old. That was our take. I would never tell anyone not to stay here. In fact, I would recommend it to most. But for our family's preference, it wasn't quite what we were looking for.

It took three trips to the front desk and finally a manager over rode the price on the extra nights so I did get the lower cost. One might want to make two reservations if they are staying on the weekend and then during the week to get the lower cost. Nice hotel with nice views.

Check in was a breeze, even though we were there 2 hours early. Our room was ready, and we went right up. We were surprised that there were no interior hallways, but this seems normal for Daytona. Upon entering the room, we found a clean, large, and inviting room. The only issue was that the AC was not on. It's an eco friendly room, so when the balcony door is open, the AC shuts off, and comes back on when closed. This did not happen, so the front desk promptly sent someone up to reset the AC, and it worked fine, though it never shut off with the door open. There are two things to consider when staying here. This section of the beach does have traffic, so you have to have to look before crossing. Also, the parking is a little tight, with beams on the lower section of the garage. This can easily be remedied by parking on the upper level, if you don't mind a hot car. Overall, we both enjoyed our stay here, and will definitely consider this for our next trip to Daytona.

The carpet looked to be brand new free of stains and any sticky feeling like at some other places. The bathroom was very clean with plenty of towels and samples. The room itself smelled great and the furniture on the balcony was very nice to have for relaxing outside. The beds were very comfortable and clean. Also we liked the flat screen T.V. and having the desk for our laptop which we did not have trouble connecting. We drove our midsize SUV and had to park in the back which is fine plenty of room. The only negative thing I can even think of is the elevators being a little slow but that is to be expected.

We were given room 616 on arrival which had a severe roach problem. The night manager was wonderful, but the day manager Randi Roberts was less than friendly and some of her staff were downright rude throughout our stay. we were told room 616 would be sprayed and we were given room 515 the next day. While moving our things, my wife walked in on an elderly couple getting dressed. apparently they gave us both the same room, so back downstairs once again with all of our luggage in tow and we were moved to room 717 which seemed ok until day 4 when i woke up early in the morning and saw roaches and silverfish in the bathroom and shower. Apparently they have a roach problem due to the rooms being efficiencies and people bringing food during their stay. Don't get me wrong, the renovated hotel is nice. But this is no excuse for their unprofessionalism and poor customer service. I expect this sort of treatment from say a super 8 motel, not a holiday inn resort. I have stayed at many holiday inns and have never experienced the problems i did at this hotel so i'm sure it is an isolated incident. Guess ill stick with Mariott from now on. Also, due to the pool gate to the beach area being unsecured and unmonitored, there is quite a large number of youths and people from the beach taking advantage of the hotel's pool and spa. By my count, there were at least 20 unsupervised children in the pool area. ANOTHER accident waiting to happen. Sadly, the beach was littered with trash every night and while some of it was picked it up, alot of trash remained and it was evident from all of the birds scouring the beach. On a side note, Ormond beach is 15 mins north and quite secluded, clean and beautiful.Also, A large number of beach shops and stores lining the daytona strip were closed or had gone out of business and The boardwalk pier was closed for renovations, since we didnt want to deal with the traffic, our sightseeing options were limited. The renovated hotel is nice at first glance, but masks the underlying problems of a poorly trained staff overwhelmed with day to day operations of such a large hotel and it becomes evident in its treatment of guests. Also, despite leaving a very generous tip for our server, he never once returned to check on us or the other family seated next to us. The hotel seems more concerned with turnover and enhancing their bottom line as i later learned room 616 was booked by another family within an hour and half of our switching rooms, so i doubt the roach and silverfish problem was treated for the next guests. With the new renovation, this resort has the potential to become a wonderful destination but ownership dropped the ball with the poorly trained management and staff and in my opinion falls short of a \"resort\". I took pictures of the roaches with my camera phone, because Ms. Roberts seemed not to believe us, and despite bringing these issues to the attention of ownership and management, their response was pretty much, \"sorry, but we can offer you some excellent discounted rates on your next stay!\" Heh.

Great value.\u201d", "Author": "royayn", "ReviewID": "UR121497910", "Content": "Terrific. That\u2019s the best word I can use to sum up our stay. We got a three-night bargain deal and had never been there, so we didn\u2019t know what to expect, other than the good reviews we saw here. We purposely chose a time of year that wouldn\u2019t be busy, yet still warm enough to be beach weather, plus we went midweek. Those decisions really paid off. The hotel runs basically parallel to the beach, so nearly all the rooms face the ocean. You enter from the exterior in the front, on the road side, and the rooms run through the building to the back, where there\u2019s a sliding glass door to a balcony facing the ocean. It looks like there are a few rooms on either end that don\u2019t have the ocean view or the balcony. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what we were supposed to get on our bargain rate. But when we checked in, we mentioned that we were Priority Club members. Because of that (and, I\u2019m sure, because the hotel was so empty), we were upgraded to the top (seventh) floor, facing the ocean, in the middle of the hotel. Fantastic. We were also offered late checkout and a couple of drink coupons. The front desk staff couldn\u2019t have been more helpful. They even called an hour after we checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. I have to say the money put into the renovations really shows. This is among the best Holiday Inns I\u2019ve stayed at. Everything feels neat and clean and new. One interesting tidbit: At the shopping area up the beach we ran into someone who works at another hotel. Once he found out where we were staying, he said \u201cIs it as nice on the inside as it looks from the outside?\u2019\u2019 We said yes, of course. But from what he said, the renovations have caused a buzz among the beach hotel community. The pool is nice, fire pits are a nice touch for an evening drink. Beach is beautiful of course. And being on the seventh floor (bugs don\u2019t fly that high), and being there in late October (perfect weather), we were able to sleep with the slider open listening to the waves crash on the beach all night long. As some people have said, I could see where parking could be dicey at times. They\u2019ve got a double-deck lot on the front (road) side and a smaller lot on the back (beach) side. It\u2019s tight. It was no issue at all for us, but I can see that it might be a squeeze with a full house. If you\u2019re into the shopping/clubbing/nightlife, there are other hotels closer to the center of the action than this. You could walk it, but probably wouldn\u2019t want to. For us that was just fine, but something to consider if you like to be within walking distance of the center of the action. A very small quibble: wireless connection in the room was a little dicey. Most times it was fine, but it seemed cranky at times. Just an aside, because a few people have mentioned it. Yes, there\u2019s a resort fee. It\u2019s smaller than most I\u2019ve seen. I\u2019m never quite sure what this is for. The pool? The fire pit? On the last of our four days we heard a poolside bingo game going on, so I guess that was part of it. But I don\u2019t blame these guys. Most hotels play the \u201cresort fee\u2019\u2019 game, so they can list a lower room rate, then tack on a mandatory fee, even if you have no intention of joining in the bingo game. Since the fee is mandatory, I would be thrilled if all hotels just built it into the room rate so when you compare rates you get a true comparison. I definitely appreciate those hotels who build it into the room rate. I\u2019ve wasted too much of my time comparing rates, only to find out that the lowest wasn\u2019t really the lowest because of the hidden fee that I had to burrow through a web site to find. Again, that\u2019s not a criticism of this hotel. Their fee is lower than most. But it\u2019s an industry practice I could do without.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, with comfortable Beds.\u201d", "Author": "jrobba", "ReviewID": "UR121462621", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Holiday Inn Resort Daytona Beach Oceanfront, as part of a deal purchased through Living Social.

In fact, we ended up buying one of their pillows, because it was so comfortable. They had a great heated pool, that lights up at night, along with a hot tub and gas fire pit. It's also right on the beach and you walk out the back for easy access. We ate at the restaurant downstairs for breakfast which was decent, probably a tad overpriced, but the food was good and it was nice to sit outside and eat next to the ocean. All and all it was a very good trip, the only blemish on the hotel was the living social deal put on by Calypso Cay resort (A sister property in Orlando), tried to tack on a 90 minute time share presentation, which is not stated in the Living Social deal. I think that not only am I the wrong demographic for trying to make me sit through their presentation, it's a bad business move to try to add in a hidden catch after I've purchased the deal. I called Living Social about it, and they were not aware of any presentation, and told me that the Resort would be in breach of contract if they made sit through it.

In fact, we were very tempted to have our friends stay at the host hotel so we could enjoy the huge modern style bathroom with a shower with room for six people... and a very nice balcony with a view of the water. All in all, this has to be one of the nicest - cleanest - newest - most modernly convenient - of any in Daytona. We stayed in a suite with a pullout in the living room. Don't know if all the rooms are suites, but if you are planning a longer visit, the kitchen was nice and the suite would comfortably sleep 4 if you don't mind a pull out.

We were warmly greeted as Priority Club (Holiday Inn's rewards program) members and were upgraded to a suite. The room had fabulous views of the ocean and beach, and had modern if not lavish furnishings. The hotel's architecture is somewhat older (some of the other reviews have noted a little awkwardness in the room layouts) but the rooms have been upgraded about as much as they can be without knocking down the whole building and starting over. We enjoyed the pool (large and comfortable temperature) and the poolside bar. When we were there, the hotel didn't appear to be very busy, kind of off season for the dates we visited. This hotel is located a little distance from the 'Boardwalk' area of Daytona Beach - good and bad, good as that means it's quieter and not as crazy-party oriented, but also there's not a lot of restaurants or other attractions within walking distance. We still tried to find some good local offsite restaurants but surprisingly one of our best meals was breakfast at the hotel - service was super attentive, prices surprisingly reasonable, and food was great. The big attraction is of course the beach, which did not disappoint, and we took great advantage of it. We were a little let down that the hotel didn't have more organized activities for our five year old because she really enjoys them. Apparently, based on the flyers we saw, kids' activities take place early Saturday afternoon and scheduled activites for other days are more grown up oriented. The hotel has a 'splash pool' for kids that is geared more towards 1-3 year olds, it also has an indoor kids activities center that looked inviting from the inside but was always closed when we went by (might be a rainy day thing). On our trip the weather was great and we spent our time on the beach or by the pool anyway. All in all we had a great time on our getaway and enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The beachfront vistas are about as nice as it gets, hotel staff was cordial and helpful, and the room was comfortable and modern.

New rooms feature complimentary high speed wireless internet, refrigerators, microwaves and flat panel TVs. Our bathroom has one sink mounted in granite, plus a tub with an adjustable shower head. Beds are comfortable and offer four pillows - two soft and two firm. Air conditioning in our room works great. We have no couch or seating area in our room, just a small square table with two chairs for dining. Internet access codes change every Saturday at midnight. I'm using a wired connection, which so far, has been reliable. Desk chair is fully adjustable. Lamp lighting is good and has two outlets, as does the lamp between beds. The hotel has no beach chairs or umbrellas of their own, except by the pool. Chairs and umbrellas are available from private contractors for $30 a day. Hotel room windows face east to the beach. The balcony of our room has two chairs and a small table. Unfortunately, the combination of afternoon temperatures, plus heat rising from the parking lot and the exhaust from the room air conditioner makes the area intolerable until after sunset. Although the web site lists \"full kitchen,\" our room does not have an oven. Silverware (which should probably be a set of four) includes only one place knife, three teaspoons and four place forks. Kitchen cutlery includes only one plastic pasta server, one serving spoon and one flat spatula. No knives. Directly behind us is a parking lot between the building and the beach - a detail that's significantly missing from the web site's \"view from the hotel\" photo. The fitness center comprises one recumbent bike, one elliptical machine and two treadmills. Towels are complimentary, but germicidal spray or wipes are not provided. Bring your own. Vending machines are on odd floors only. Today, the one on Level 1 is out of order, as is one of two guest washing machines on our floor. Washing or drying is $2 per load. A in-room hotel directory of services and general information would be helpful. None is provided.

When i got back to the hotel get on phone with the bank they say you are over drafted on you account \"um how?\" the nice guy at the front desk neglected to tell me that he swiped the hole hotel stay on my card and then refunded it right back too late it takes the bank up to 5 days for them to re credit the money . So I went down to the front desk and confronted them after a hour of explanation they said we can help you fix it. I said can i have a small refund on my stay in cash so i can get breakfast for me and my family, The lady at the front desk said go eat at the hotel restaurant and charge it your room, not really what i wanted but okay.

It is a beautiful hotel..staff are pleasant & accommodating. The rooms are very nice, we had a mini kitchen, the bathroom is large with a great shower, everything is spotless. Great pool, restaurant/bar. Fantastic view of the Atlantic Ocean. All the rooms are smoke free as is the hotel. Maid service was excellent, especially Jasmine (she told me she was from Turkey)..very nice, hard working, young woman. I would definitely recommend this hotel, you will not be disappointed.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201c5 Million Plus Renovation and WOW!

Now my Wife and I are Platnum Priority Club Members and we stay on Points when on Leisure time like this two night Trip. So I surfed the Priority Club Rewards nights and this hotel was one of the options for Daytona Beach that we could use our reward points to stay. The Reviews I read kinda Scared me so I called the Front Desk and the reception person explained that they just completed the 5 million Plus Renovation so I said OK we are in. When we checked in there was a ribbon cutting going on with the Daytona Chamber of Commerce so \"Ching Ching\" Free Appetizers and Beer and Wine! We got upgraded as we are platinum status so we had a nice suite with the Kids had there own little Room with Bunk Beds and a TV! The Kids Director was so Fantastic and always remembered each childs name during the Poolside games, Amazing actually. I wish I could remember her name! Sorry... Kids Director you were great. She had little prizes for all the kids and kept them entertained very well. The Beach in front is Awesome with Lots of Beach Sand between the Hotel and the Ocean. The Moom over the Ocean was amazing in the Evenings. If you have little kids take them to Daytona Lagoon, we actually got there late and just did the Arcade and Pizza and They had a blast. The Holiday Inn Resort is All New, Beds, Pillows, Bathroom Towels and everything was Top notch. The other Perk is Kids eat free at Holiday Inns, so up to two kids eat free with one adult! and the Bar Restaurant had an inside/outside Seating Option. The Fireside pits were lit in the Evenings and instantly became a gathering place for the adults, we met nice friends and even one of the Owners came and set and chatted a bit! I'm attaching a few photos of the Holiday Inn Resort Daytona Beach for your viewing pleasure. I Highly Recommend this Hotel for your next Daytona Beach Stay. You will simply be blown away.

We sat by one of the two fire rings by the pool, soaked in the hot tub, swam in the ocean and swam in the pool. Met nice spring break kids and a nice couple who were also there for bike week.
