We had a small, clean, well furnished and comfortable room, with a safe but no coffee/tea making facility. The toiletries, like those in the other NH hotel we stayed at in Madrid, were eco friendly, smelling of apples and oranges. Sometimes I wonder, with so much fruit going into cosmetics, its a matter of time before we will not get enough to eat !! My fear that the \"anti oxidant\" breakfast would be a disappointment for the taste buds was unfounded as it was quite a good spread. Different breads and rolls, croissants, yogurt, nuts, cheeses, jams , fruits, salads and good coffee. Only the scrambled eggs were avoidable. The staff at reception are friendly and helpful. Not only did they guide us about getting around the town but also booked a very good tour with an operator who was far superior to what our travel agent had arranged. That the hotel does not have a regular restaurant for lunch and dinner was not a problem as turning right and walking for five minute walk brought us to a small square with a few restaurants and bars, at one of which we had some excellent tapas and sangria sitting amid locals, well away from the hustle and bustle of the Ramblas. \"Room service\" means ordering pizzas from some outside agency, which apparently takes its own time to deliver. Internet is free in the lobby. The hotel is located in a quieter area of the city and there are not many tourists around, However, Catalunya is just three or four stops away by metro and in about fifteen or twenty minutes we could reach the city center. The price is well worth paying and we s would certainly stay there again,,,if we are lucky enough to visit Barcelona again.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coventry, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWont be Returning\u201d", "Author": "elderblossoms", "ReviewID": "UR116252761", "Content": "The Hotel itself was a good price, and only 2 metro stops from the Rambla, however the food ordered was of poor quality for the price paid, such as a chicken ceaser salad did not have any chicken in.

The rooms are small, but that is not the problem. It needs a new coat of paint and some of it looks a bit unfinished. The room has a balcony, but is on a busy street. The free television channels are only in Spanish and the television is also an old one, not a flat screen. At least the minibar is not as expensive as in most hotels. Also, the 24 hour internet costs ca. 10 EU which is half the price of the last hotel I stayed in. The breakfast buffet is very nice with a Jura espressso machine and a large selection of foods including scrambled eggs and bacon or sausages. It costs ca. 10 EU if you book it for the whole stay as opposed to 14 Eu if you book it by the day.

Checked in at 11.15pm which was not a problem. 5 min walk to The Metro. then 10 mins journey to Catalunya Square. Metro leaves every 4 mins generally speaking. Last Metro from Catalunya Square is at 23.52 in mid week & 1.30am or so at weekends.Metro starts at 5 or 6am. Get the T-10 tickets where for 7-8 Euros you get 10 single trips in the same zone. Not much to do around hotel. However, there is a newsagents which is less than 2 mins walk and a bar that is 3-4 mins walk. Also, a couple restaurants. However, we only went out for a couple of hours on the first night. We paid \u00a3120.00 each for 5 nights. Would be surprised if anyone found anything cheaper as I have seen a few sites that charge a lot more. You can order food from your room at night. We were told 30 min wait. However, we waited nearly 2 hours. Room was cleaned on a daily basis by a friendly cleaner. Friendly receptionists who speak basic English. Summary - excellent price and location. In 15 mins you can get to Catalunya Square. Catalunya Square hotels are way more expensive & La Rambla has a lot of dodgy people. So this place is brilliant as it is close & easy to get to Catalunya Square, without actually paying shed loads and being in Catalunya.

The hotel provided a more than adequate breakfast. We even skipped lunch everyday, although never passing up the opportunity for gelatto. The rooms were standard European size with comfortable beds. There was a safe in each room and the bath products were better than most hotels. The front desk was impersonal and very businesslike.

I really liked it and would happily go back, despite its flaws. THE GOOD Firstly its staff are a credit to the hotel. They are wonderful and very professional. They recommended the top floor to us as they have balconies. If you can get 721 it has a balcony bigger than the room itself, otherwise the other rooms on the top floor have balconies and it makes the difference from a fairly boring, standard business hotel to being somewhere really pleasant to stay. With views up to Tibidabo, (kind of) down to the sea (just), and along Via Augusta the balconies make the hotel. Sitting out there, having a glass of wine (bought at the supermarket down at the other side of the station, mini-bars are way too expensive) as the sun went down over the hills was lovely. THE BAD The most expensive and worst wireless internet access I've ever had the misfortune to endure. Really slow internet. I work online and was constantly disappointed. They need to switch providers, Swisscom are overpriced and just rubbish really. THE UGLY It's over a subway line and you feel the vibration even up on the 7th floor - I didn't mind but it kind of freaked me out until I realised what it was :) To be honest you'll get this even in more expensive hotels in Barcelona, I have no idea why... There is no iron or trouser-press in the room which is kind of annoying when you have meetings. The room could've done with a lick of paint and a little bit of a touch up - it wasn't bad by any means but I got the impression they don't have a programme of annual room maintenance and it would have been good if they did. The parking is 15eur / day which is a lot of money though a lot less than the car park otherwise charges. The hotel is a little way out from the Ramblas area which we quite liked because we're doing research on living in Barcelona and it's a bit calmer and \"nicer\" around Via Augusta and up towards Tibidabo (where it gets very posh). We had a really pleasant stay, the hotel was calming and relaxing and we were very pleased with it.

It is on a very busy street. There are rooms that face the back. Back rooms are smaller. Bath is huge and clean. Beds are comfortable. The staff is so nice. Very helpful and friendly from front desk to maids. The hotel like many in Barcelona exist above the metro. At quiet times, one can hear the trains roll under the hotel. This happens in better hotels too. A very good tapa bar is 100 meters from the the hotel: turn right toward the train stop it is right on the corner. A bit pricey, but very tasty. Tapas of all sort in the window. Look for this. Breakfast is very adequate. Hot and warm selections. The hotel is three stops from Catalunya. It is nice to be away from the La Ramlas maddness and come to the room. The hotel is not too bad and not the best, but adequate for the budget traveler.

What Barcelona Hotels seem to do is to catch you with a low first night rate and then raise the rate indiscriminately. Not very nice. A rip-off that should not be tolerated by the hotel websites. The location is away from the tourist masses and what a relief this is, certainly during busy periods. However, the selection of restaurants in this area is not large and all allow smoking. The Condor staff could only recommend one, the Cormiols, which also turned out to have prices about 2 to 3 times as high as other restaurants in the area. This hotel is a rehab and it has some features that would be considered building code violations in the US and other countries in continental Europe. Also, the soundproofing is terrible and we had a screaming child in the next room for several nights. It frequently smelled as though someone was smoking in our bathroom and this spread through our bedroom. The smoke was apparently entering through the exhaust. Pretty awful for non-smokers and we had enough of smoking throughout Barcelona. Even Restaurants advertised as \"no smoking\" establishments allowed smoking.
