The location is very good, easy to get to and from the airport by bus or train, and right by a metro station which makes getting around the city a breeze. The room was clean enough, if not overly inviting. And I found a creepy crawly in the bathroom the morning I was leaving. Luckily I was leaving when I saw it scuttling around so I hadn't spent 4 days tiptoeing and on the lookout, as I would have if it had been the first day. In my opinion, the marble floors that cover every inch of the place are totally impractical for hotel where people occasionally want to sleep. The bathrooms, rooms, hallways...marble. Every sound, every footstep, every door opening and closing sounded like it was right in the room. There is nothing anywhere to absorb any sound. One of the reviews here had warned of that, but I still hadn't expected it to be quite that loud.

All sounded very lovely and we were looking forward to our long weekend in Barcelona. We arrived at the hotel where to our surprise we were given a small twin bed room. No sign of any 'relaxation kit' with the closest thing being the token tiny bottles of shampoo/bodywash that you often get at hotels plus a couple of little sachets of moisturiser. Certainly no bath salts! We went downstairs to say perhaps there had been a mix up and we were given the wrong room. We were told that no - there are no king beds at all at Onix Fira (despite their hotel online booking forms saying clearly either queen or king size beds and no mention of twin beds). We were told that out of 80 beds there are only 5 queens...and even though I booked months in advance, had checked 'king' on their website, and then personally requested a king in the comments and had the booking confirmed by them we were still given a twin room. I have just checked the Onix Fira hotel website and it still says they have rooms with two beds, or 'king size' beds. I suggest thinking single bed where it says queen (as there is no way 2 people could sleep in one of the beds we had), and queen where it says king size. We were told the 'relaxation kit' was just for marketing and was in the bathroom already. He was pleasant enough, but did not do anything. I will complain about the false advertising with Travel Zoo and would not recommend booking any deals you come across through them. It is a pity this tainted our initial view of the hotel and of Barcelona. The location is good - an easy walk from Barcelona Sants train station, which is a 25 min train from the airport and nearby to Placa d'espanya so easy to metro around the place. Yes, the surroundings are like staying in a construction site. You need to walk in the wrong direction to be able to cross the street and get where you want to be, but other than a bit of inconvenience it wasn't a problem. There was no construction noise in the evenings although they did work Saturday, but we were up and about anyway. We did get woken by people returning to their rooms in the wee hours as it is tile flooring only so very noisy - as well as woken by rooms being cleaned first thing in the morning and chairs/beds being moved around scraping on the flooring. It's an easy 10 minute walk to the Magic Fountain which is well worth a visit or 2. The room was clean, but there was a lot of wear and tear. Lots of scuff marks on the walls and wear and tear in the bathroom. The decor is very dated with cheap polyester bed covers. Upsides - the shower is very good, and the buffet breakfast was plentiful and had a lot of choice plus differed slightly day-to-day.

The garage is adequate and safe (Euro 15 per day) for leaving the car. The entry and exit ramps are narrow and one needs to be careful when turning. The breakfast is absolutely fantastic with cold cuts, pastries, different breads, milk, tea, coffee, cornflakes, fruits and juices. Fresh and delicious. Staff were friendly and helpful. I had called the hotel a day before reaching and they had assured about late check-in and availabilty of parking space in the garage, both assurances were kept. Room was clean, the bathroom was big, hot water was available at all times. Towels in the bathroom and linen on the beds were replaced daily.
