The location is perfect for going to Disney or Universal. We had a 2 bedroom unit which could use an bit of TLC (it's a bit dated). Can't complain too much, the unit was spacious, it was clean, the location was good, with decent restaurants and shops nearby. My one (and only) real complaint is that the unit had a jacuzzi/whirlpool, which we were dying to try out. It didn't work however, I'm pretty sure it just needs to have some maintenance done on it. The beds were comfortable and everything else worked as promised, so we didn't let the lack of a working jacuzzi spoil our stay. The kitchen is well equiped, with a microwave, a stove and of course a fridge. There were also a washer and dryer, very handy after a week of long hot days at the themeparks. We got this unit from my father in law, who swapped his timeshare elsewhere for this. If we had had to pay any significant amount to stay here, I would probably have reconsidered. If you can get it through a similar deal I would recommend it, otherwise I would recommend looking around a bit longer.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cBugs and bad customer service!!!\u201d", "Author": "alsaBoston", "ReviewID": "UR86642891", "Content": "We picked this hotel because of its location and value. The saying is true, you get what you pay for! We got a 2 bedroom suite, which was located in the far corner of the complex (can't even call this place a resort). And then had to climb up two narrow flights of stairs with our suitcases to get to our room. Looking out the window, we had a view to a trailer park on one side and field of weeds on the other. Around midnight when we got back to the room we noticed little bugs everywhere. Kitchen counter, stove, bedrooms, bathrooms, on our luggage...everywhere! We asked to check out and have our money refunded. They wanted to put us in the room next door! We refused to even stay the night. After all that, they refused to refund us for the first night saying we stayed until after midnight. Luckily we booked through a third party who gave us back that money as well. Unbelievable!

There are hundreds of hotels in the area, but we didn't want to drive around to search, so we hit the internet. Also overwhelming, so we tried our timeshare exchange company, which only gave us dates too far in the future. Having stayed at several other timeshare hotels in the area, with much success I might add, I picked Celebrity off the list because it had the lowest per-night rate. We might have been slightly better off sleeping in our car in a parking lot somewhere! The place was clean, and not noisy, so clearly I experienced something different from the other reviewers here. First of all, there are no accessible rooms. When I asked, I was told that all the rooms are the same. And there are no elevators. One flight of steps would not have been a problem, but I use an ECV mobility scooter at Disney World and need to charge it in the room overnight; I cannot get it to a second-floor without an elevator! So we were given a first-floor room. We drove around to it and got a parking spot (no handicapped parking, either, btw) right in front of it, only to be dismayed when we discovered that there are no curb-cuts! My husband and teenage daughter had to lift the quite heavy and bulky scooter up onto a grassy area because there are parking stones blocking the curb at the edge of the sidewalk in front of the room. Okay, one minor issue, we were only planning on 2 nights anyway. As we walked in to the room, I saw how spacious and well-appointed it was, acceptable levels of lighting, full kitchen, stacked washer/dryer unit in a closet, with its own lighting, comfy sleeper-sofa (pull-out convertible) and two side chairs, dining table with chairs, two counter-height stools for extra people, separate bedroom with king-size bed (at a normal home-bed height, not so high that I'd need a footstool nor have to climb up onto it). I then looked at the coffee table and the side table; the coffee table was missing its glass top. Then I opened the t.v. armoir doors to see what kind of storage was in there, and one of the doors' top hinge was missing! I immediately called the front desk to let them know the condition when we walked in. They sent someone to verify it so it wouldn't come off of our security deposit. Oh, yeah, they nickel & dime you: a $50 security deposit, a $3.79 per day resort fee (supposedly for the in-room coffee which we don't even ever use; plus towel-use fee!); $11.99 per day for wireless internet service PER COMPUTER. This is a timeshare, so I'm used to not having daily maid service unless I pay extra for it, but a daily towel fee? Get real, Celebrity. The bathroom also was set up in an odd way, there was the advertised whirlpool tub, but the shower was IN the tub! You stand in the whirlpool tub, thank goodness it has a flat, not contoured, bottom, and the shower-head is a movable sprayer. Unfortunately, there was NOT enough hot water to last a full shower, even one of my daughter's short \"camp\" showers! A call to maintenace resulted in someone coming the next morning, rather late to shower that first night, then, wasn't it? All he did was turn the thermostat on the water heater up 5 degrees. One day, my daughter wanted to go to the pool while we went elsewhere. I told her as described to me at check-in, pool towes are in our unit, they have yellow/white stripes, as opposed to the all-plain-white bath towels. There were supposed to be three, since there were 3 of us staying there, but alas there were only two. But only one of us was going to the pool, so I never reported that, and hence we didn't have to pay yet an additional fee to get a third pool towel! But HELLO, as we were getting ready to check-out on our final day, however, I did notice a piced of cheerios-type cereal, lying on the top of the base of the dining table! My kids are well past the cheerios stage, and anyway we didn't have any cereal with us, let alone those shapes of pieces! So perhaps housekeeping wasn't so keen anyway, as reviewed previously here.", "Date": "April 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cNice surprise\u201d", "Author": "slappythesecond", "ReviewID": "UR39765325", "Content": "I was very concerned after reading several of the reviews.

We picked the Celebrity Resorts because it was the only one available with 2 bedrooms, and their website looked decent. I did read some of the mixed reviews on here, but have read mixed reviews of other locations we've travelled to and we've always had a great luck in the past. Check-in was probably our only problem here. We knew we would be arriving early but hoped for the best that our room might be ready, unfortunately not, but they did say we could use the pool and other facilities. Since we had been travelling since early morning we just decided to drive down the road and eat a late lunch. They took my cell number and said they would call if the room was ready before the regular 4:00 check-in (it was about 2:30 at this point). So we went and ate, no call, so we drove around for a bit to get our bearings, and headed back to the hotel just before 4:00. The room was still not ready but they took all the check in information, and as I was about to get a bit upset the phone rang and they said housekeeping had just finished. I do have to say the 2 ladies at the check in counter were very friendly and apologetic throughout the whole process, I have nothing bad to say about them at all. When we got to our room (a main floor room) I knew that it wasn't one of the completey renovated rooms that I had seen in the photos, the carpet and furniture were a bit worn, the dishwasher was ancient, but the bathrooms were updated and the stove was new. Regardless, it was really clean, had no strange smells as others had noted, and was quite spacious. We were just down from one of the pools and it was nicely heated, the hot tub was really hot, and there was no noise from other tenants. They did start maintenance on our pool about mid-week so we had to go to the main pool, but no big deal there, what's the difference between a 2 minute walk or a 4 minute walk? The only problem we had was with our clothes dryer, it took about 3 hours to dry a small load of laundry (luckilly I wasn't planning on washing many clothes!). I didn't bother to complain about it because I really didn't care, so I can't say how a complaint would have been handled. Overall we really enjoyed our stay here, it was private, clean, and for the amount of time we actually spent there we really enjoyed it. I also have to say hello to the British lady that works in the snack shop - from your friend, the Canadian Corrie fan!", "Date": "January 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta", "Title": "\u201cNever stay at this place or buy from them!!!!\u201d", "Author": "S-Dabbah", "ReviewID": "UR16952139", "Content": "I was invited for 3 night and 4 days, the catch was to be on a timeshare presentation.
