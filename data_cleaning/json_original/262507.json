The people at the front desk were very friendly. The \"lakeside\" rooms overlook the street and parking on top of the opposite building, so we assume that you need a high room to actually see the view of the lake. Breakfast was coffee, juice, hard boiled eggs, cheese, rools, croissants. It may have been served in the room because we were off season and there were few visitors. The hotel is a bit hard to find, although there was a big sign at the messy intersection/traffic light where 216 and 217 intersect. It was within easy driving distance to restaurants in Marino and Castel Gondolfo, but walking would be a problem due to traffic and few sidewalks.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Merseyside", "Title": "\u201cQuite nice but could be better\u201d", "Author": "Holidaylover091", "ReviewID": "UR119587226", "Content": "This hotel is in the countryside, about a mile walk to the nearest town of Marino (worth a visit) We arrived mid morning, and were surprised to be welcomed very charmingly by the gentleman at reception, and shown to our room. We had a HUGE room overlooking Rome in the distance, it was extremely clean and comfortable, the decor was a bit dark, but quite acceptable. There is a mini bar although the prices are on the high side. It was too late in the year to use the pool, but the area looked really nice, with covered seating and tables which are obviously in use during warmer months. There is plenty of free car parking, and free wifi, for which you get a card from reception. The hotel has comfortable seating areas in the public rooms, and is warm and hospitable. Buffet breakfast in a very pleasant breakfast room, with a good choice of food and drinks. Now for the downside, NO RESTAURANT !!! We were shocked to be told when we tried to book Dinner, that the restaurant is only open in the evenings during busy periods. Given that we were some distance from town I found this quite disappointing, as it meant either driving (no pre dinner drinks or wine then !) or walking down narrow, unlit roads (no pavement for part of the way) to one of the couple of places within a short walk (10 minutes) This was unexpected as we had hoped to have relaxed dinners at the hotel. The lake which the hotel overlooks is also a drive away, what is not made clear on the website is that the hotel is on top of a very steep hill with the lake at the bottom, however the views are fantastic. When you do visit the lake the whole area is pay and display to park. There are some nice restaurants and a water sport area. I would recommend this lovely hotel, but the lack of a restaurant should be addressed.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Stay for a visit to Marino!\u201d", "Author": "gnocchi13", "ReviewID": "UR116258066", "Content": "I visited Marino for a wedding in July, where the bride made accommodations at this hotel.

Far enough from Rome for peace and quiet but close enough to see all the sites. My room was very large and very comfortable - the hotel is very clean and the rooms a serviced every day. The staff at reception are very helpful and friendly. They provided me with lots of information about how to get around the area, bus and train timetables, where to eat etc. The pool area is small but very clean and relaxing. The hotels restaurant has a good buffet breakfast with a nice selection, and a choice of coffees and teas, with freshly made espresso and cappucinos. It's not open for dinner but that doesnt really matter - the best food in italy is where the italians eat! And there are plenty of good restaurants within easy reach. I didnt have a car but this wasn't a problem. The hotel arranged for collection from Ciampino airport - on time, easy to arrange and cheaper than a taxi. There are good bus services allowing for connection by train into the heart of Rome. The hotel is between the two towns of Castel Gandolfo and Marino with very nice restaurants. You can walk in 20-30 minutes. Its a bit hilly (but then Rome is built on 7 hills!) - that just gives a good excuse for another gelati! Last bus from Castel Gandolfo is 23.30pm - so no problem with a nice evening out. Dont think that it will be party central - its just a nice little country place where real italians live. The Pope holidays here but its all very low key - except Sundays for the month when he's in residence there but otherwise its very relaxing and just locals and a few stray toursists. Before you go do a little research on the web to see where you would like to visit. The local bus service is Cotral. In Rome you have the choice of buses and metro from Rome Termini. There are open top buses - between \u20ac20-\u20ac25 for hop on hop off - or the 110 which is a public tour bus. In Rome Termini station the tourist information area will give you plenty of advice for using the local transport. If you want to visit somewhere like the Borghese - check online before you go as you may need to book in advance - but its worth it. Bus fares are \u20ac1 and the train is \u20ac1.90. Locally all the restaurants are good - but note that they shut about 3.30pm - so have pizza. On the way from the hotel to Marino - look out for a little place on the right hand side of the road just at the base of the hill. There is no sign but it sells local naturally sparkling water and lovely local wine from large vats. One hazard - the black cat! Lucky - unless you fall over her! She insists on lying on the black mat in the entrance of the hotel.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "roma", "Title": "\u201cNot to recommend\u201d", "Author": "yorkyRoma", "ReviewID": "UR115244253", "Content": "we stayed here for 2 nights and the service was atrocious.

The pool area was tacky and quite dirty as were the public toilets in that area. Whenever we needed assistance we had to go and seacrh for the staff there was never anyone visibly on duty.

The hotel is nice, on top of the crater and overlooking the lake Albano.It is close to Gastelgandolfo and very close to Ciampino airport. The rooms are large except the bathroom, that was tiny and dark. Decoration is quite kitch, a pity for the magnitude of the hotel. Breakfast was ok, buffet with selection of sweets but little salty food (egg...).Enough for me except the coffee that was a cup and that\u00b4s all. The hotel is far from Rome ( about 20 kilometres) but we managed very well as we had a rental car and we drove every morning to ANAGNINA ( where there is a large carpark 1.50 euro a day. It was so full of cars that we had to go to the following Metro station in CINECIT\u00c1 ( there is a shopping mall, you can leave the car and it costs 5 euros the whole day. The only problem is that it closes at 8 pm). other times we left the car parked close to that shopping mall but in the street, near SUBAUGUSTA Metro station. Getting to those places from the hotel takes about 15/20 minutes (depending on traffic), and then you can movein the city using Metro. Quite convenient. I paid 105 euros a night a triplex room for 3 people. The check in was easy but the check out was loooonnnng. We were in a hurry going to the airport and the receptionist needed a code for cancelling reservation and a code for charging the total... I still do not know it I have been charged the room twice. I arrived a few hours ago and let\u00b4s see tomorrow in t he bank. Very slow and not very professionals. We found a fantastic place for dinner nearby, called IL GIARDINO, VIA BAROZZE 53, ROCCA DI PAPA.

We arrived here for a four night stay due to a wedding. We were well aware of the 'remote' location and this didnt bother us. Yes taxis are a nightmare here in italy, we were quoted 90 euros one way at the airport for a taxi, we overheard someone else saying that they paid 160 euros! We decided to public transport it, 10 euros each; but it took us three hours; one train, one tube and a hot bus ride but it was still a 70 euros cheaper and far more satisfying! On arrival the setting of the hotel is amazing! sat on top of the volcano overlooking the lake, checking in was easy and the room that we had had a view of the lake! Rooms; large, clean, comfortable and a rather small bathroom but hot water and a good shower, do you really need anything else in a room that all you do is sleep in, o yes the walls are very thin as well!? Then the hiccups happened. On arrival we were some of the first paying guests of the season. Water was 2 euros a bottle for a 500ml. We were told that we could borrow the iron. The next day with more paying guest arriving water went up by a euro, the iron disappeared and we were told it was 2euros an item regardless if it was a T-shirt or a dress shirt, pool towels were being charged at 3 euros per towel, there was no restaurant in the evening due to it not being peak season. And the shuttle bus, with the prices they were charging it should have been a Royal Royce! 25 euros and then 15 euros per person for a 1km trip into Marino!!!!!! Needless to say we used our feet, fine if you are like us: 30's, no children but a nightmare if you have disablities or children. The 1km walk takes approx 15 mins with some very good restaurants in Marino but be prepared for italian drivers and no street lighting at night! The lake also has good food and is about a 20mins walk. Breakfast is large and there is no limit, toast, cakes, cereal etc. The pool is large, clean and deep and the grounds and hotel well looked after. The thing that really annoyed me is the charges as they know they have a captive audience and taxis wont take you anywhere for less than 20 euros. Why not stagger the cost for journeys? there is a station 2 km down the road that will take you directly into termina ie central rome but the hotel are still asking 25 euros! i write this at the hotel about to embark on my trip back to the airport and due not being able to get the station{ Refusing to pay 25 euros + 15 euros with my wife} our route is as follows: bus into Marino, bus into rome, tube to termina and then train to the airport, you have been warned. If it wasnt for these hidden costs i would recommend it to anyone because the location is lovely, further enough from Rome to be in the country but near enough to be tourist.
