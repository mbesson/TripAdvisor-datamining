After reading many Paris trip reports and reviews on the website, I was better prepared for the trip. I took earplugs and had a \"sleep\" playlist on my ipod, but never needed them. I did hear my neighbors when they got a little loud at times, but never constantly. I was in room 505 and being that it was an upper floor, I heard normal street noise. Several nights I even slept with the balcony door open and wasn't bothered. After all, this is a major city so some noise is expected. My friend was in room 305 and she was bothered a bit more by street noise, but she also is from a rural area in the US, so she she's accustomed to quieter surroundings. My bed was comfy, and did not have plastic between the sheet and the mattress. I also packed my own wash cloths, as they were not provided. The hospitality of the staff was great, and I was also prepared to leave my room key at the desk whenever I left, so I took advantage of the in-room safe. I was also able to use the stocked minibar to chill a few sodas and bottled water that I purchased. Most importantly, the value and excellent location are what will have me returning again and recommending this hotel to friends. I booked early and directly with the hotel and got great rates for 2 single rooms. After a night of flying, we opted to take a taxi from CDG to the hotel which cost 65 euros, but on the return the hotel arranged a shuttle with one other hotel stop and the cost was only 32 euros for the two of us. We each bought a caret (10 metro tickets at 12.50, rather than then normal 1.70 per trip), but the metro sharing the same lines with the RER can be a bit confusing, even for someone who spent 10 years taking the metro in Washington, DC. It lacked just enough signage for me to give up, but we were able to take the RER to Tour Eiffel for our appointment to go the top (which I highly recommend as the lines were horrendous), the Invalides, and Musee d'Orsay, as well as the funicular up to Sacre Coeur so it wasn't a total loss. this hotel is so convenient to Notre Dame and the L'Open Bus tours which we used as transportation for the remainder of our trip. Another tip is to consider visiting the Louvre on Friday night when it stays open to 9:45pm. I had heard of crowds there, especially herds of people around the Mona Lisa, but it was much less crowded than I anticipated.

I was excited to try this hotel because of the many rave reviews on this site. I will agree that the location is excellent -- in walking distance of many major sights, and near the St. Michel Metro and RER lines. However, its location in a busy pedestrian area made my street-facing room extremely noisy. The street noise didn't subside till about 2:00 each morning, but was then followed at about 5:30 by delivery trucks, trash pick-up, and construction vehicles. Also, there is little to no soundproofing between rooms. Perhaps if you are a light sleeper it would be best to request a non-street-facing room. My other issue was with the bed. The mattress was covered with a plastic protector, with the bedsheet directly on top of it. This made for a hot, rumply, uncomfortable bed.

I had done a lot of research prior to making my reservation, and I was rather excited at this little find. The location is fabulous! It\u2019s situated on a pedestrian street off Boulevard Saint Michel in the 5th Arrondissement in the excitement of the Latin Quarter/St. Germain on the Left Bank. It\u2019s a bustling area full of cafes and restaurants. The River Seine is a short walk as are many sights: Notre Dame Cathedral, Sorbonne, Pantheon, etc. The hotel staff are polite and accommodating. And they have a special addition to the staff: Isis, a brown tabby cat, whom I was told is \u201cthe boss.\u201d She wanders the halls, rides the lift, and greets guests.

The following are the reasons my review is not higher. Please note that I\u2019m traveling for an entire month with multiple destinations, so perhaps I\u2019m being much pickier than I would be if I were enjoying a quick holiday then returning home. 1) Room size, 2) Noise, 3) WiFi Accessibility, 4) Breakfast\u2026 - Room Size: The rooms pictured on the website are either a select few or there is some trick of depth perception. They did not prepare me for my room (double with balcony on 5th floor), which was very, very tiny\u2014a narrow walkway around the bed granted access to the balcony on one side and the bathroom on the other side. It was crowded for just me and my luggage; I\u2019m glad I\u2019m small and not sharing the space with someone else. - Noise: The website made a point of mentioning that the rooms are sound-proofed. This in particular caught my attention since it's a lively area, and I'm a light-sleeper. But the only things that seem to be sound-proofed are the windows. I heard little street noise, but I heard every sigh, giggle, and bed-frame bump next door, which started within an hour of my check-in and went on intermittently for the next two days. Then each morning vacuuming the hallway began around 9am and random knocking and banging started in from somewhere in the building\u2014remodeling something perhaps? Point is that every noise traveled through the walls from all directions. Of course, this is the nature of an old building, but I don't understand why the hotel emphasizes sound-proofing when it\u2019s not really a strength. - WiFi Accessibility - Every place I've stayed (every place in every city!) offers free wifi access for their guests. This hotel charges for the wifi. I believe it's 3 euros for 24 hours and then \"deals\" if you request longer time--I got one week for 10 euros. But when I went to connect, I discovered that the charge is \"per access point,\" meaning I had wifi on my computer, but if I wanted to also be able to use it on my iPhone, I had to pay another 10 euros. Ridiculous! - Breakfast - I've grown quite spoiled by gourmet breakfasts being included in the stay at other places that I was rather disappointed to discover that the breakfast here is 12 euros, and yet includes only \"continental\" items--pastries, juice, etc. Based on the size and noise in my particular room and the add-ons, I think it was overpriced.

The RER B is just round the corner (St Michel station) which gets you door to door to CDG and Orly airports, the RER C also serves the stop which gets you directly to the Musee d'Orsay and Eiffel tower. Breakfast is charged at an additional 13 euros. It is a buffet, and the description in the lift says that in addition to the cold buffet of breads, danishes, cold cuts and cereals, a hot breakfast eg omelette could be provided on request.

Everything about it was exactly what we were looking for for our first trip to Paris. Close to everything, Metro right outside the door, in the main part of the city where there is lots of action. We must have looked at 50 hotels on trip advisor before we chose this one (although it WAS the first one we looked at as well, so we could have saved ourselves the time :-)) The hotel is right on a busy street in the heart of the latin quarter. Pro: easy to find restaurants, wine, pastries, shopping, there is an easy-bike rental right outside, you just put your card in and pay something like $2.00 for a half hour bike rental. Con: this meant there was noise from the street as businesses got their morning deliveries and at night when the bars were closing. I didn't notice much of this noise, but I live in the city and am used to it. if you want total peace and tranquillity or are a very light sleeper this might not be your spot. There is a concierge 24/7 and all were very kind and helpful and spoke english. The room was cute and clean and the housekeeping service kept the room nice. Our bathroom looked recently remodeled and was very nice, although the shower was typically european (read: small!). We paid a bit extra to have a balcony, and it was well worth it, I liked sitting on the balcony watching people on the street with a bottle of wine at the end of the day. There was a fridge but it was only for the mini bar items, which was inconvenient because it would have been nice to have some snacks on hand after a long day. I didn't check the minibar prices, but i just automatically assume they are ridiculous. There was also a safe in our room. Bottom line, this hotel was more then I expected for something with a 2 star rating. The price was on the high end of moderate but was on par with other hotels we looked at in the area. We would certianly stay here again. One small caveat about the neighborhood is that it IS a touristy area, so some of the restaurants are blah to yuck.

My wife and I cannot speak to the breakfast they serve because the allure of finding that amazing brasserie was too much to resist each morning. They even went above and beyond helping our lost friends find us at Au Bougnat, and even calling ahead to the restaurant to let them know our friends were coming so we could move to a table of four.

We had room 205 with a balcony which definitley added a nice Parisian/romantic feel to the room but I wonder if rooms without balconies are bigger? I would be interested to find out. I never stayed in central Paris before so I cannot compare it to anything else unfortunately. Check in was perfect and the girl was very friendly. The bed wasnt terribly comfortable but it was fine! The room was a bit chilly at times- I dont know if the balcony contributed to this but the air con/ heater most certainly did not heat the room up. Handy to have a TV, hairdryer little mini bar and plenty of storage space in my opinion. Some poeple have mentioned lack of safet deposit boxes and plug sockets but our roomm had plenty of sockets and a working safety deposit box. The room was cleaned every day and we received fresh towels also. Some people have conplained about the noise but I wouldnt even mention it to be honest. Everything closes really early (12/1 am) which surprised me after reading some of the reviews here. If you are staying in the heart of the Latin Quarter what do you expect ? Similarly I thought that the size of the bathroom was fine... Location is ideal- I booked meals in two of the top ten restaurants on TA and both were a short walk away (max 10/12 minute walk). Right beside Notre Dame and Shakespeare and Co and a direct line to the Eiffel Tower (RER C roughly 10 minute journey). You can catch a bus to the Louvre that takes you directly there roughly a 4 minute journey.... I have mixed feelings however while as I would recommend this to a friend I would ensure that they are aware of the room size, temperature in March etc. I really dont think I would bring my parents here as they would probably rather somehting a bit further out that has a bit more comfort. However I suspect that had I stayed in any other location I would not have enjoyed my trip to Paris as much nor would I have had time to see so much. There are plenty of little wine bars around if you take a stroll that are open till roughly 1.30/2 am and if you are into nightlife thats just around the corner too. I payed \u20ac120 for the room... I feel \u20ac100 would have been a fairer price OR if breakfast was included it would have felt like better value. I know that rooms are available for \u20ac80 - these were all booked up when we tried to book one but I think had I payed \u20ac80 per night I would definitley feel as if I had better value for money I dont think the extra \u20ac40 for a balcony is worth it. Some people have also said that the staff seemed rude...initally I also thought this but after my 3 day stay I can say that they were extremely helpful with everything and the guy on at the night time was actually very nice and accomodating to any request we had and tried to make conversation with us always. Overall location is excellent, if you can get a room without a balcony value for money is excellent, it is clean and friendly however if you are perhaps a little bit older and are looking for a luxurios break in Paris stay further out....if you want to stay in the action but still have a lovely romantic break this is the place for you!", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pembroke Pines, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWonderful, memorable experience\u201d", "Author": "basulto", "ReviewID": "UR99602621", "Content": "A really, really cool boutique hotel.

This was our 10th trip to Paris over the past decade. In the past, we have stayed predomenently in the 7thArr. though we have also stayed in the 1st & 6th. The hotel was perfectly located two blocks off the Seine and just off of Rue St. Michel. Parking in the St. Michel parking lot was easy less than 100m away for a fee of 25 Euro per day. The hotel was clean, convenient, and the staff was freindly. The price was clearly indicative of the location and maybe a bit pricey for the 2 star rating but in our view was worth the money for the convenience. The Metro was a two minute walk from the hotel, as was the RER. The walk to Boulevard St. Germain was just 4 minutes, as was the walk to Notre Dame. We tried several resturaunts in the area that we recommend. Two that stand out are Le 24, which is off of Boul. St. Germain on an alley less than 500m from the hotel and served excellent traditional French food and Chez Ernest is a mere 90m from the hotel and served a fantastic menu at VERY reasonable prices. Some areas for improvement on the part of the hotel: (1) On two occasions we were given the wrong room key by the hotel reception. It only caused a minor inconvenience but the fact is that for the short period we had a different key in our posession, we \"could have\" had access to other folks rooms were we dishonest people.

There's some bustle but it closes at a reasonable time. Arriving at the hotel from the airport was a snip on the train, just 4 stops and a 200 yard walk. Going back took longer due to weekend working on the lines, whic his worth checking as the delay could be significant and cause a missed plane. Our flgiht was cancelled and the hotel staff were helpful in finding rooms for us and also in contacting Air France. This is the Latin Quater, it's a busy area, so there's a lot around you in terms of places to eat, drink and walk. Do not come here for a quiet reclusive weekend, it simply will not happen.

When we got off the RER B from CDG at the Notre Dame/St. Michel station without having to change trains and then had to carry our luggage less than a half-block to the Hotel Europe Saint Severin, I bragged to my husband about how I\u2019d clearly done a great job picking a well-located hotel. We entered the charmingly worn lobby and were greeted by the resident cat, and I was in love. We arrived around 8 in the morning and learned that the hotel was completely full, so our room wouldn\u2019t be ready until the official 1 pm check-in time. We therefore stored our luggage (note that storage is in an unlocked closet hidden around a corner from the reception desk, so I wouldn\u2019t describe it as secure) and ventured out to wander around the city. Our room was ready when we returned at 1:00. We booked a superior double room with balcony and had requested a renovated room at the time of booking, after having read here that some rooms have yet to be renovated. Reception had noted this request and confirmed that they were assigning us to a renovated room, located on the second floor. We avoided the hotel breakfast and Italian restaurant, since this is Paris and there are much better dining options everywhere you turn. Of note, staff spoke excellent English and were generally helpful. The hotel had an odd practice of requiring guests to leave their room keys at the front desk when they left the property, but we rarely had to wait long to get our key back when we returned to the hotel. I did notice that even if we came in and spoke with a receptionist we\u2019d not previously seen, all we had to do was state our room number, and we were handed the key without any confirmation we actually belonged in that room \u2013 obviously, traveling with valuables is a bad idea in general, but this particular hotel definitely had some lax security practices. We used a tiny creaky elevator to bring our luggage upstairs but otherwise used the stairs throughout the rest of our stay. The clean, tastefully-decorated room was somewhat small but pretty typical for Europe, and the layout and use of a pocket door for the bathroom optimized the use of space. There was a decent amount of drawer and hanging space, and the small safe in the armoire could accommodate several cameras, a netbook, and important documents. Double doors opened to the balcony, which was essentially a narrow platform running along the outside of the building, with iron gating used to provide symbolic (though not really physical or visual) separation of the balcony areas for neighboring rooms. There was a tiny outdoor caf\u00e9 table and two chairs situated on the balcony, and the view was of the bustle of the pedestrian Rue Saint-Severin. This bustle is a great segway into why I would never again stay at this hotel, as incredibly charming, well-located, and reasonably priced (for Paris, anyway) as it was. When I travel, I spend very limited time in my hotel room and generally use it for the sole purpose of sleeping. Unfortunately, sleeping is virtually impossible at the Hotel Europe Saint Severin. The noise from the street is incredibly loud at all hours of the day, be it a weeknight or weekend night. We thought we might get some relief when the restaurants closed in the wee hours of the morning, but apparently this is when construction vehicles move in to take advantage of the lack of pedestrians \u2013 they started doing work on one of the buildings across the street using very heavy equipment and lots of loud machines. My understanding from reading reviews was that double-glazed windows in the renovated rooms meant guests could hear very little from the street, but that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth! I travel a fair amount and was prepared with earplugs, yet even with these in (coupled with a dose of sleep medication one night out of desperation!), the noise remained unbearable. It\u2019s worth noting that I\u2019m a light sleeper, but even my husband (who could probably sleep through a home burglary) was disturbed by the noise. Further complicating things is the fact that the hotel\u2019s HVAC system is set up such that it can provide either heating or cooling, but not both. Because we were there in November, they\u2019d switched over to heat for the season, and the switching process is apparently complicated enough that it can\u2019t be modified to account for weather fluctuations. The weather during our stay was unseasonably warm (in the 60s F), and there was clearly a lot of additional heat being generated from the building, as it was VERY hot in our room. For perspective, I should mention that I get cold very easily and frequently set the heat in my home to 75+ degrees and still shiver a bit\u2026so for me to feel the hotel room was uncomfortably warm is saying a lot. Not realizing the HVAC circumstances, we turned our room thermostat to cool with the fan on high. This only made it hotter, as it blew hot air instead of cold (this is when we spoke with reception and found out that there was no functional A/C). So what choice did we have? Right, we opened the balcony doors. There were two huge problems with this, however. As I mentioned, the balcony wasn\u2019t really separated from the balconies of other rooms, so anyone could have simply walked into our room while we were sleeping. The bigger problem, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve guessed if you\u2019ve been reading this entire review, is that the open doors meant the already-atrocious noise situation became completely intolerable. Even in writing this review, I\u2019m nostalgically recalling the romance of the hotel and its location. But I can\u2019t stress enough that no matter how tempting it might seem, you should avoid staying here if you want to get any sleep at all \u2013 it\u2019s not worth ruining your vacation because you\u2019re simply too exhausted to enjoy it!", "Date": "February 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cPERFECT hotel\u201d", "Author": "pu9", "ReviewID": "UR56887484", "Content": "I stayed there with my friend for 5 nights.

We booked directly though the hotel's website which gave us the cheapest rate. The location is off the corner from Place Saint Michel, there is a Metro Station right there. We found this to be one of the best stops because if you used the Metro as much as we did, the Saint-Michael / Notre Dame stop is well connected to other Metro lines. The Hotel is also about two blocks from the Notre Dame cathedral. It's location was great for all the tourist attractions. This is not a 5 star hotel, it is two star, but since we wanted a safe, clean place just to sleep and at an affordable price this fit the bill. The staff was friendly and spoke very good English, in fact we arrived early and they got our room made up in an hour. They have an area to leave baggage, don't freak out, there is no lock on the door and they don't give you a ticket but apparently it's safe -- our bags where there upon our return. Since from all the reviews I have read that Paris hotel rooms are small I was mentally prepared and our room was small. The room was very clean, comfortable bed, don't bring big suitcases, they have an armoire to hang your clothes, small flat panel TV (that had CNN intl). The shower is small but had excellent pressure and very hot water but word of advice bring your own toiletries, the Hotel only provides a bar of soap. The downside is since we were there during the start of winter we would open the windows to let in the cool air (since they turn off the AC) and since our room faced the street you would hear the noise from the street which included loud bars, cafes, drunken Parisians singing at the top of their lungs and at 5:00 am the beep, beep, beep of the garbage truck and weekends were worse. See if you can book a room towards the inside. I would not book with breakfast included since there so many restaurants all around and right around the corner to the left was a bakery that was open very early that has baguettes and croissants and good coffee. The area of the hotel is in the Latin Quarter, so it looks like something out of a postcard from France with cafes and cobblestone streets and lots and lots of restaurants and tourist shops. You're near the area of the Sorbonne, so there are a lot of students. By the way, you also have to leave the key every time you leave the room with the front desk which took us a while to get used to, but nothing happened. There is no free wi fi, you pay about 3 euros and they give you a code which is good for 24 hours, but as we found out free Wi FI is quite rare in Paris, if your lucky, some Mcdonald's have it but it was very iffy. I wouldn't recommend this Hotel for a family but for a couple or a single traveler, this is a good hotel with an affordable, central location to get to all your must see stops.", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent for short stay in Paris\u201d", "Author": "manyplaceslittletime", "ReviewID": "UR48546872", "Content": "Superb location, clean and tidy hotel.

This was our 3rd visit to the St Michel area, all in different hotels. Still looking for the right hotel! The Europe St Severin hotel was value for money for the rate I paid. I suggest the proprietors of the Europe St Severin invest a bit of time and effort into a spruce up of the hotel. My initial impression was of a hotel being loved to death. It is obviously very popular and the location and pricing are great but just a bit more attention is required. Our room was clean as was hotel itself. All staff were very friendly, helpful and spoke English happily. Our polite efforts in French are excruciatingly awful. We had a balcony room overlooking Rue de La Harpe, which with restaurants the length of it is very noisy and smelly unless one loves Indian, Asian et al. The combined aromas wafted up and into the room. Double glazing on doors and windows would be advantageous. Rubbish dumpster and street washing trucks very early in the mornings made an horrendous noise and late night restaurant clients were also audible. The hotel guests were not noisy in themselves but noise from rooms and corridors did travel. The bedroom was spacious, had the most floor area we have had in a Parisian hotel. As is common in France the toilet was a tiny room separate from the bathroom area, which was a very small open plan door-less space with large corner bath behind the built -in wardrobe wall. No privacy with visibility from bedroom area. The shower is going to cause water ingress behind the tiled walls. Other critiques have mentioned the idiosyncrasies of the handheld showers and in a building the age of this one I'd have concerns about structural damage it must be causing. 2 of the bedroom lights had the wobbles and required maintenance attention. Room had appropriate furniture and bed was one large bed, in Europe called a Matrimoniale - not two large singles pushed together, so that was good. Overall decor spartan but adequate. The wooden floors are very cold in winter, in fact the room was very cold but admittedly winter arrived unexpectedly early in Paris. Bed with duvet was warm and comfy. I particularly sought out a room with balcony which we valiantly used in spite of freezing conditions out on it (not hotel's fault obviously) but suggest they ditch the absurd recycled black rubber tyre chairs. They might be waterproof but are ugly, uncomfortably low, only suitable for people the height of a pygmy. Two weatherproof outdoor chairs of a normal height would enable guests to enjoy their balcony and watch whatever is going on up and down the streets. The area is lively and vibrant. The main hotel lift is very large and modern. The reception area is large but all furniture was shabby and uncomfortable and maintenance was overdue on the odd chair or more. The tiny area used for the breakfasts is not adequate for the number of clientele however I suggest what was available was not worth 12 Euro PP. A Macdonalds is at the other end of Rue de La Harpe, a Boulangerie and Paterisserie is around the corner and across the road next to Chez Clement the gorgeously kitsch Happy Days Diner had a wonderful choice of basic meals, including breakfast, for extremely good prices. A hearty breakfast for 2 there would not cost 12 Euros. We had a dinner at Chez Clement and at Happy Days and both meals were perfect whilst going from one end of the spectrum to the other price wise and the diverse decor at both venues was lovely. I recommend both. The St Michel area is a very easy Tourist location due to the St Michel Metro/RER links, and proximity to the Seine, Notre Dame, and numerous other easily accessible sites. It is perfect for walking around and by following the Seine and crossing the many ponts the majority of must see Paris monuments and museums etc., will be reached.", "Date": "October 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, helpful staff, room slightly larger than average\u201d", "Author": "RossOttawa", "ReviewID": "UR47140158", "Content": "Within easy walking distance of Notre Dame, lots of good restaurants, near St Michel Metro.

My husband and I are tall (6'-1 and 5'-9 respectively) and we didn't feel crampt. The bed was very comfortable after a long day exploring the city. The only draw backs were minor, the air conditioner really didn't work at all, it just spat out drops of water and made noise but, we never contacted the front desk about it so, it may have just been out of order. Also, the walls are quite thin (you can hear your neighbours talking) but, we were lucky in the fact that we didn't have noisey neighbours and I think thin walled hotels are pretty common in Paris.

The room had a small balcony with a little table and chairs. It was well-organized for a small room. There were shelves in the closet for storage. The bathroom was updated, with a shower, clean tile, and room to put things on 2 shelves. We didn't spend a lot of time in our room, but it was clean and just right for a couple. The mini-frig was restocked every day, and the prices were very reasonable on the drinks. We never got up in time for the breakfast, so I can't comment on that. We visited the pizza/Italian restaurant next door....very busy on a Saturday afternoon, when we arrived. We also visited Lutece restaurant (on St. Michel, less than a block away). Liked both restaurants, and they were kind about our pitiful French! The staff at the hotel was always friendly. You do have to leave your key at the front desk each time you leave the building, but it was never a problem....there is always someone on duty. Noise was a small problem only one night......there was a family with a baby next door, and we could hear almost every word. They were gone the next day, though, so it was quiet the rest of the time. Noise from the street did not seem to be a problem...the sound-proofed windows sealed it out. Great base for exploring....several metro stops nearby.....however, be careful to note that they can be confusing with similar names. When we arrived from CDG (took RER B), we literally walked around about 30 minutes before we found our hotel, even though it was probably only a block or so away.....just kinda confusing.

It was no problem, however, as the thick walls and windows kept out the noise. But actually they loved the bustling neighborhood anyway!

We moved rooms as i wasnt happy with the first one, but I had only asked for the room to be cleaned, we were told that was not possible so they moved us to one that was not refurbished and it was dreadful: bigger, dirtier and a bit sad looking (point of story dont change rooms you will be punished)..but at least we could walk around the room without falling over the bed like in the reburbished one. The old room also had a shower that you could stand up in as the reburbished room there was only a bath and a hose and no shower curtain so you would have to sit in the bath, not very practical really..

Before adding my words of advice, I must add that knowing what I know now, I would consider staying there again since I now have all the information I need. With the remainder of my review, I will share information to help you know what you need to know now. 1.) After checking in, you will be shown where they serve breakfast. This DOES NOT mean that breakfast is free. At this point they charge 10 Euros a day which seems expensive (bread, jelly, cut up fruit, ham, cheese, yogurt, coffee and juice). You are better off eating at a bakery. 2.) They supposedly can arrange shuttle service to and from Charles de Gaulle airport but most did not seem to know that. Your best bet is to take the train, so pack lightly. It is risky to arrange a shuttle through them since there really is no guarantee that they will follow through. But now you know. A cab ride is another option though expensive, around 55 Euros. 3.) Last, but NOT least, stay away from rooms ending with \"18\" or you will be next to the noisy elevator. Unless something is available that day, you will have to wait (have fun sleeping). FYI, for yoga and meditation classes, rasa-yogarivegauche.com is within walking distance. Take St. Germain direction opposite Seine, turn left on St. Germain and then left on St. Jacques. Also while there is a small grocery store down the street, take St. Michele (away from direction of Seine) to St. Germain and cross street. One of the side streets has a great grocery store.

Dozens of restaurants literally on the doorstep, the Seine 50 meters away, metro station, river boat, major sites ditto.

We had to postpone our departure to Paris due to illness, so called the hotel the morning we were due to go to see if we were able to cancel our first night. Not only did they let us do so without charge, but when we arrived a day late, they had upgraded us to a deluxe room. But that was the problem... The room looked fabulous - when you look at pictures of the hotel exterior, it's the one on the second floor, with the balcony wrapping around the front of the building. We were very excited about sitting out on our little table and watching the bustling street below. However, at night, the noise from the street was immense. I am renowned for being able to sleep through anything, and although I could drop off ok, I was continually woken up - and that was with all the windows closed. Drunken partygoers scream and shout until about 3am - which is fair enough, we were there at the weekend. But then, from about 4am, the street cleaners come out in force and start banging about empty bottles and rattling shop-front grilles. This, coupled with strange bangings from inside the hotel led to two very tired and grumpy people each morning.

The room we received was a dump with horrible beds and very little room (nothing like the pictured and promised room). The rooms, halls, etc. were very shabby with pulled up carpet, stains, thin walls, dust, dirt, and construction mess everywhere.

We have travelled a lot and could say the hotel can be ranked as 3 star hotel. While many hotels adverstising themselves at various net booking sites claim to have very central location but turn to be much more far from center, that particular hotel really is at great location. Its in most lovely Latin district, with tens of great restauraunts, some clubs and coffee shops around. The hotel was very clean and the staff, specially the young staff, was very friendly and helpful. With us they had some booking error at first but they fixed it very quickly and professionally. You can take you breakfast buffet for 10 euros in the hotel but we recommend to try also some local coffee shops just next street where you can get you hot fresh croissants and coffee for less price and feel more parisian and less tourist. And as its so close to Seine, have at least once the breakfast with you take-away-coffee-and-croissants sitting on river stairs next to Notre Dame. If you stay in the hotel we will also recommend you a lot to visit Latin Paradise cabaret show in the same region (some 15 min walk from the hotel and Notre Dame) that was absolutely great and is conisidered as one of the very best cabaret shows in Paris. We have seen several shows like that and it was really just great - very professional and also tasteful. Around the corner from the hotel great music was played at St. Michel street, starting 23 and lasting over hour on weekends. And once in Paris, check also the Notre Dame concert and mass times from net before you go - thats definately \"must to do\" at least once when you stay so close to ND. And one more tip - in case you arrive on Monday for a week or for long weekend, check the \"carte orange\" travel ticket that you can buy also at airport metro or RER station - the ticket for 1-5 zones that costed only 31 euros included return ticket from airport to Paris central, week long free travel in all Paris (all bus lines, metro and RER trains included) and even RER trip to Versailles, some Paris nearby areas, so its great to know that if you wish to see around.
