The bride had suggested this motel and another in the general vicinity. Mind you, the bride is living back east and only made the lodging suggestions based on locale. To give you an idea of the area, we noticed a large population of transients on Rosecrans within several blocks of the hotel. Thankfully there were none on the actual hotel property, but plenty could be seen at the Winchells right across the street. We arrived at the hotel and checked in at 8pm with no problems. One nice thing about it being such a small hotel, you park right in front of the rooms. The downside of it being such a small hotel, you can hear the cars pull up at all hours of the night. It literally sounds like someone is pulling into your room. The door and windows are not soundproof. Right off the bat you notice that the room is very small. There are only three drawers to store clothes in, despite the room being setup for 4 people. The closet is a little aclove, but was large enough considering we only had one set of clothes for each person that needed to be hung up. The bathroom was little more than a converted closet. You had to shove the door against the toilet in order to get into the bathroom. The sink countertop hung over the toilet so you had to lean forward to sit down. There was no ventilation inside the bathroom so you have to open the window to keep smells from getting into the rest of the hotel room. Upon opening the window, I noticed that the low-rent apartments next door could look right down into the bathroom. The only good thing about the whole room is that fact that the showerhead is a full flow massage unit. You are gonna need it because the main mattress is hard as a rock. I took my own pillow to make sure I would comfortable, and I still woke up with a sore back. Oh, did I mention that there is NO SOUNDPROOFING between the top and bottom floor. If you absolutely must stay at this motel, get a room on the 2nd floor. My wife and I were awakened at 2am by the people upstairs. It sounded like they were wearing lead shoes and throwing their luggage around the room. I would most definitely not recommend this hotel to my friends. I wouldn't even recommend it to my worst enemy. For $140 a night, I expect more than this little fleabag motel has to offer. It's not like there is a shortage of hotels in San Diego.

This is a much quieter motel than I was expecting. Downtown San Diego is only about 4 miles down Harbor Drive, it's nice to be 'away' from the hustle and bustle. The property is actually in Point Loma, but San Diego is just a stone's throw down the road. All in all, we are very happy with the room and the price was reasonable ($112 + tax / night). If you are looking for reasonably priced accomodations, this might be the one for you.", "Date": "June 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gold Canyon, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cUpgrading in a BIG way\u201d", "Author": "APairaDocs", "ReviewID": "UR15428989", "Content": "This is an older building that is limited by when it was build.

No elevator for second floor access, is about the only complaint I would have, but they put me in a first floor room so I don't have that complaint. It is a Comfort Inn in an older building. Everyone was helpful and pleasant and went out above and beyond to be cordial. I liked the location. Right on Harbor Blvd. and just a short hop from the airport and easy to get to all the attractions and Shelter Island. On the corner of Rosecrans and Harbor. You can get to the Interstates down Rosecrans and downtown on Harbor. Went to Cabrillo National Park nearby for a breathtaking view of North Island and San Diego. Don't miss a second floor restaurant on Shelter Island Drive (??Something??) on the Green. Sorry can't remember the name but the food was great and there are not that many restaurants on nearby Shelter Island Drive that are on the second floor. Ask and they will tell you. Get there before 6 PM for the value early deals. Great food and service.

Criticisms: Room is on the small size, as is the bathroom, and refrigerator. The walls are VERY THIN! I am hard of hearing, but I could clearly hear people next door engaged in casual conversation. There is nothing that can be done to remedy it, but it is a NOISY location, and the parking lot is barely adequate. A few times, I was the last vehicle able to get a parking spot. There was a LOT of renovation going on at the hotel, mostly seemed to be cutting tile, and that contributed to the noise. This was limited to day-time, and did not negatively impact me in any way. Congrats: The front desk staff is some of thre nicest, most helpful people I have encountered in any hotel/motel. I often stay at far more expensive hotels, and I wish the staff there were this congenial. Bed was comfortable. The room and shower were clean. The WIFI worked well, but avoid something called SDBAYFREEWIFI. Once you make the unfortunte decision to connect to this wireless network, it seems impossible to remove it from your computer, or to de-select it as your default network. VERY close to the airport, Marine base, and loads of good places to eat. I would definitely recommend this for a short-term stay, for those on a budget, or those who are unfamiliar with the area. All in all I was pleasantly surprised. I would assign it a solid C grade. I think the fact that it is named Comfort Inn leads to some disappointment.
