{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Dirty old hotel Old building, but the most terrible thing is this property was not properly maintained!The room and bathroom were dirty. I even thought that the room had not been cleaned for weeks when I first entered it! Do not forget to bring your own towel coz they only provided old, dirty-like towels! I even bought a towel at a nearby department store!! One more thing, the pillow was very very hard!", "Date": "Aug 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR545420949", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ChicksterWowo"}, {"Content": "Nice typical hotel       Entry of the hotel", "Date": "Dec 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR360651621", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "loutchia"}, {"Content": "Lower Your Expectations.. The only good thing I can say is the location, it's at the heart of Kuta, about 10 mins to Kuta Beach, 15 mins away from airport by cab, and a lot of restaurants  shops around.The deluxe room that I stayed in was a bit small, air conditioning was not cold, the bathroom looks old and could use a makeover. There is no boiler available, but a flask of drinking water is provided and topped up daily. The pool is small and blocked by high walls at all 4 sides, so there is no view to enjoy.We are very irritated with the fact that satellite TV is listed under the facilities, but there is only 1 channel available at one time. I'm not sure how they change the channel every few hours, but it seems that every time we turned the TV, we always get a different channel (sports, fashions, movies, etc) at the same channel number (3). I asked the operator and she confirmed that the guest room TVs can only view 1 channel at a time, so if we wish to view a particular one, we have to call the operator and she will change it from the management console. This is a very weird arrangement, not to mentioned that there is no programme guide booklet available so you wouldn't know which channel to ask..If you want to go to Jimbaran to have seafood dinner, the receptionist can arrange a transport for you because they partner with Ganesha, one of the restaurants in Jimbaran that provide free pick up service. Just tell her/him what time you want to go and the restaurant will send a car to the hotel to pick you up.", "Date": "Jun 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR994858794", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Husky23"}, {"Content": "Do not stay here! My son, an experienced back-packer, was due to stay here for a week but flatly refused to stay when he saw how disgusting the pool was and how the room was 'falling apart'. e.g. Rusty bathroom door, hngaing from hinges. Also in what he calls a very dodgy area. The staff were incredibly rude to him too, completely unhelpful. He was ven willing to pay 50% cancellation fee just to get out of there.As he has been to Bali before he knows this is not the normal Bali welcome. It was lucky he had been to Bali before as he knew his way around and took himself off to the Barong Hotel which he had stayed at last time and took a room there - same price as Summer but beautiful hotel with friendly staff. incidentally the only reason he didn't arrange to stay there in the first place was because bali hotels told him it was fully booked!Do not send your kids to this dump!!!", "Date": "Jun 11, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR663812165", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "gloria700"}, {"Content": "\u9417\u5e7f\u4f00\u6d93\u5d84\u7a76\u9287\ue218\u4e97\u9288\u5a3f\u4f28\u9287\u6d96\u5031\u9288?#x201d;
