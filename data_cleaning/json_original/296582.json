Although looking a bit weird at night, I would say is rather safe, given the fact that I came at 12 in the night and everything was calm and quiet. For those of you who want to spend extra-money, I would recommend a hotel located a little bit near the central area (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque), but this area is good also. As I was saying, the Grand Bazar is right across the street so those of you looking for the traditional shopping will be delighted. The hotel itself is very very clean, the rooms are basic, but the cleanliness is the main advantage. The price can be discussed either on e-mail, either on the reception. You get a 10% discount for paying in cash. If you get one of the rooms 602 or 603, the view is very nice, overlooking to the sea so in the morning is very nice to wake up and look to the window.

Overall, very decent for a hotel. The staff was polite, helpful, speaking English at a decent level for Istanbul.

I've stayed at several other hotels in other parts of Turkey and for a hotel in this price range: it has the best breakfast layout. While some rooms are a bit small compared to other more expensive hotels that should be expected. I've spent up to 5 days with 2 people in residence and found them adequate. One is there to experience the wonders of Istanbul, not spend time in the room. I've never heard noise from other rooms in all the many times I've stayed at the Inter - I do admit that if you have your window open and are not used to it, morning prayer call will probably wake you up. Don't hear it with window closed. For the past several years, Turkey has forbidden smoking in public places so lounge is smoke free and has signs stating to the fact. A recent comment about people smoking in hallways and there rooms - one cannot always control the actions of rude guests or those tho believe rules do not apply to them. Upgrades have been done over the years - another recent comment of interest - no carpet in the rooms. They used to have it but it was changed to a wood floor which many places are now going to.

I found their communication excellent via email, their directions via tram and train from the airport excellent and the check in was effortless. The rooms are small and a little dated but exceptionally clean and completely practical. I actually had \"sea glimpses\" (as opposed to a view, which was a bonus really as I would not have thought that possible) The location for going to the Grand Bazaar couldn't be much better and less than 100 metres from the tram. The breakfast was actually really good with plenty of variety and goes till 10.30am. There is a lift so it's not all stairs and anything your require by way of help from reception you will find them to be very friendly and helpful. Free internet is a fantastic bonus these days when most hotels rip you off something terrible for something that should be like electricity in this day and age...FREE ! Well done on that Hotel Inter. The one thing that reminds me that Turkey is not much more than a third world country is that they allow smoking in the hotel. People will come out of their rooms to smoke in the hallways, but worst of all some people will actually smoke in their tiny little lift and this is disgraceful in the 21st century. We just don't want people's filthy poisonous gases, plain and simple. It's time to get a grip on this one and ban the smoking in your hotels. One good thing was that they do NOT allow smoking in the breakfast restaurant, thank God ! All in all I was happier with this simple low-priced hotel than I have been with so many much more expensive hotels I have stayed at and would not hesitate to sty here again or to recommend it to anyone else.

Staff - Well, the first set of ppl that one ends up trusting while touring is the Hotel Staff and thats why this place is good. The staff is honest, always ready to help u. The two receptionst that I enjoyed talking to were Latif & Metin. I always use to pick up some chit chat with Latif while goin out and coming back and he was more than happy to talk and answer my queries. I can't forget the first day when i askd bout need to hire services of sme tour operator and though they cud hve got sme commission, I was told not to as the old Istanbul is within walking distance. No one will offer that kinda advise easily. 2. Location - Well this is the best part, this hotel is very near to the the bus stand, metro and all other tourist destinations of old Istanbul are within walking range. Rest you can always catch a metro and visit. Also since its in a lane behind the main road so it offers all the peace u need to sleep at night (smethin u might nt get say if u stay at sme place on the famous Istikal Caddesi) 3. Affordability - Its a very good value for money if u r visitng Istanbul for Istanbul and nt to spend time in the Hotel. They offer nice, decent and clean room. If thats all u r lookin for. 4. Morning breakfast is decent and whether u r a veggie or non-veggie, u can start ur day with full tummy :) ..... FEW GENERAL TIPS: [didnt know whr else to share this ;) ....] 1. Do buy AKBIL (its a electronic pass that is accepted in every public transport - metro, bus, funicular, ferries/boats) and make ur life easy while travelling. 2. I am a complete vegetarian & found these places with great difficulity - Parsifal & Zencefil resturants ... both r on Istiklal Caddesi and within a difference of 50 mts & opposite to each other. 3. As far as the bhosphorous cruise goes - half day bhosphorous cruise which is of around 2 hrs is sufficient (full day option is waste of time, unless u r a cruise freak) 4. Take some time out and one ur first day, take a ride on HopOn HopOff bus, the good part is they will take u around all the places in Istanbul which r worth seeing and u can also get down at some places to visit em and then board the next bus. These are red in colour & double decker and start from Sultanahmet Center (Across St. Sophia). 5. If ur hotel is givin u free pick up from airport then its fine and if u want to avoid the costly taxi then take a Havas bus which goes till Taksim Square or take metro. Believe me metros are comfortable. 6.

It's not a Marriott or De Vere class hotel, but a basic, clean hotel, ideally located for all the major places of interest with friendly and helpful staff. Our rooms were on the top floor, the lift goes up to the 5th floor only and then a few short steps on to the 6th floor. The showers in the bathrooms were great, very powerful hot water, just what you need after a day's walking around Instanbul and first thing in the morning. The hotel also provides a wide selection of food for breakfast including juices, bread rolls, eggs, cheese, fresh fruit, cereal...something for everyone! The eggs are delicious and it's worth making the effort to go down to the basement for breakfast. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly and they will help you to plan your days out and give you suggestions for the best way to get around. The tram and ferry system is the best method to get around Istanbul and I would advise anyone visiting to purchase an 'Akbil' token. It works like an Oyster Card. Cheap and efficient to get around instead of using expensive taxi's. The hotel is located close to the Grand Bazzar, Blue Mosque, Spice Market, Topkapi Museum, Bascillica Cistern, etc. To get to Taksim Sq it's a tram ride of about 15 minutes. The hotel is located in the Sultamahmet district of Instanbul. Reasonable selection of places to eat out but shop around and don't go to the TARIHI SULTANAHMET K\u00c3\u2013FTECISI this place is over rated, over priced and very bland food. Ignore the reviews! You'll find better food elsewhere in Sultanahmet or Taksim. I would recommend this hotel for anyone that requires basic, clean accommodation located close to the attractions. As always, it would be unbalanced to just write praise so in terms of improvements I would suggest that the hotel re carpets the stairs and the bed rooms. The rooms on the 6th floor have laminate floors. Elsewhere the carpets look grotty and could do with replacing to really make the hotel shine.

And the road to perfection continues highways: discreet, polite, knowledgeable and flexible staff clean and tidy rooms, deluxe bathroom and shower (great banana flavored shower gel!) more than rich and tasty traditional buffet breakfast, welcome drinks, free wifi and even a computer at the lobby in case of need, free transfer from or to the airport (!) and a room rate not even close to the usual medium/high season hotel rates. I mean really, this rate almost cannot justify the level of offers and the quality peak of this hotel, especially in one of the oldest, largest and most popular cities in the world!

But for me it was even better as the tram stop is really close so you can go wherever you want including Galata Bridge, Dolmabahce, Taksim etc. Now I'll try to mention at least some of numerous pluses and values of this hotel. First of all the room and bathroom were spotlessly clean every time we returned home after a long day on feet, towels were changed daily, breakfast was nice and tasty, especially fresh turkish strawberries and yoghurt... I loved them so much. Also very important moment is that the hotel is located in quiet small street close to the tram line but still you will definitely hear calls for the prayer at night (as for me I only heard them on my first night there). The room we lived in was quite spacious and full of light, with simple but nice and fresh furniture and comfy beds. But the best thing in the morning for me was the view over Marmara Sea and the voices of sea gulls. So I would definitely recommend room 602 (if you're lucky). TV had several english speaking channels plus NBA channel (my boyfriend was watching it all the time). Besides there's individual airconditioner, WiFi and personal safe in the room.

If I were to fault the rooms at all,it would be to say that the walls are very thin,you can hear noise from both the corridor and adjoining rooms.This did not concern myself as I use earplugs as a norm...as my husband is noisy sleeper!!!...we did however have a group of students in the Hotel whilst we were there and they were rather noisy,as young people are....which I totally accept...I was also young once!!! I just mentioned this to LATIF,a senior member of the reception staff as it had disturbed my husband more than me,.he was understanding and offered to move us,but to be quite honest we loved the room and I just gave my husband some coottonwool to put in his ears!!! But,to our real surprise and not at all at our request he moved the students to 2 floors down, to join their other group members and moved a family to our floor who wanted a larger room!!!!......so well done LATIF and INTER HOTEL you went above and beyond and pleased three customers in one move. Just one other thing about room 602,please be aware that the lift only goes to level 4 so you have to use the stairs to get to 602.This was no problem for us, as we did not have much luggage and we are reasonably fit senior citizens. The location is minutes away from THE GRAND BAZAAR,a 10-15 minute walk to THE BLUE MOSQUE,THE TOPKAPI PALACE,AYASOFYA.We took the tram to Eminonu,where you can get the boat trips on the Bosphorous,from here you can walk over the Galata Bridge and take a trip up the Galata Tower.We were only in Istanbul 3 nights but we saw all the usual tourist sights and found it very easy to walk around the City,loved it. The only thing I was a bit annoyed about was,the fact that you had to pay another 20TL to enter the Harem on top of the general entrance fee of 20TL,and if you wanted the audio guide it was another 20TL.So please be aware travellers!!!!......I actually printed off, from the internet ,alot of information about the Palace and took it around with us. Also,if you want to eat real Turkish food and not pay a fortune ask LATIF at the desk to show you the Turkish Cafe just around the corner from the Hotel.Wonderful food you will not be disappointed.Try the many doner plus ayra,the local yoghurt drink,we only paid 2.50TL at one of the many places along the road from the Hotel to the Blue Mosque. Just to confirm what another traveller has said on TA,the Golden Horn shopping area in the Galta Bridge area,is alot cheaper than the Bazaar.Also if you like fish,do try one of the fish sandwiches from the boats on the waters edge,you cannot miss them,you will see all the Turkish families sitting around enjoying them,they are 4TL each. I could go on and on about all the little things we came across,but I shall just finish by saying we had a FABULOUS time,and if you are about to go,enjoy,walk,take in all the sights and sounds of a fascinating Istanbul.", "Date": "October 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abu Dhabi", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location in heart of Istanbul, Great Service\u201d", "Author": "SushantKarve", "ReviewID": "UR46762701", "Content": "Located at a excellent place, just near to market place.

We gave a thumbs-up to Inter mainly going by the large no: of favourable reviews by other travellers. I must say that I am not disappointed OVERALL by the actual experience. However my wife and I were left with this feeling that probably there could be better options in the same price range in Istanbul. First to point out the aspects we liked; the staff are very helpful, courteous and not \"salesman-friendly type\". Though we had a last minute change in the schedule, they were more than willing to accomodate this change. The converstations are always to the point and does not waste either party's precious time. The staff (I regretably fail to recollect the gentleman's name) at the reception efficiently helped us book tickets for an organised tour and a Semazen (Dervish) show. Patient, approachable and always present to offer help. Moving to the room, its clean, quiet and good enough for a couple who are just looking for place to catch some well earned Zzzzs.. The best part is the bathroom, which is bright, clean, relatively spacious and has a good shower cabin; plus a hair-dryer. The location is great too as its off the Beyazit main road; Bang opposite (300m) the Grand Bazaar and 200m from the Beyazit tram station. The main sights like the Cembarlitas Hamam, Blue Mosque, Sultanahmet area, great restaurants are all a brisk 10mins walk. Something we didn't quite like was the size of the room and the way it looked. It was utterly bland and spartanish. The view is a cluster of apparel shops opposite; and from our 4th floor room we could barely get a glimpse of the Marmara Sea and the ships on it (if you are on your toes) over the roofs of the building in front of the Hotel. We could mainly see a really hardworking bunch of tailors (probably working 12-14hrs) in the building opposite the hotel. As mentioned before, the bathroom was great. Then the whole hotel has a 'serious & not-so-lively' feel to it; which hits you the moment one steps in. Maybe I am expecting a lot from the 50Euros/night joint. However thats what I felt every time I stepped into the hotel and the room. It didn't seem to have the energy of a place where travellers, people on holidays, backpackers stayed and met. Lastly the hotel offers complimentary breakfast buffet; we found it really drab and ultra-boring to eat. Mainly because we saw that its the same 5-6 dishes every single morning. The restaurant is in the rather plain basement and is small place with no windows (obviously). The ambience plus the drab food is a total let down and probably the biggest negative amongst the amenities the Hotel offers. (They offer free internet access as well; which we really appreciated. However the connection speed reminded me of the speed we had in India 5 years back..be ready to spend atleast 30mins to check 2-3 mails!!) Probably I am being too much of a critic. Coz hey its a \"50Euros/night joint\" after all. With helpful staff and a great location. But something that I haven't been able to jot down here properly; is that we didn't get a good \"holiday vibe\" overall from the place.. (Guys@Inter, thanks for the drop to the Airport!) But quickly; stay here if - > you are on a budget > need to stay close to all the great sights and restaurants > need a quite lane for the night > mainly are looking only for a comfortable bed and clean loo. > are fine with small rooms", "Date": "October 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "sheffield uk", "Title": "\u201cI would recommend it to friends and I shall stay in it in my next visit.\u201d", "Author": "ballasem", "ReviewID": "UR45015016", "Content": "I enjoyed my stay in Hotel Inter and I liked its reception, services and location .", "Date": "September 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore", "Title": "\u201cWalking distance to all the main tourist spots\u201d", "Author": "kkbelli", "ReviewID": "UR42582485", "Content": "Hotel inter is located in the Beyazit very close to Sultanahmet's main historical spots .

The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s street is just perfect for me, located at the back of Barcelo Saray Hotel, away from the tourist crowd (and touts) down the road at Sultanahmet but nonetheless only few minutes walk. I checked on other hotels around Sultanahmet before ending up with Hotel Inter and realized that I could not find any better value than this. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s maybe away from the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia, Topkapi Palace, but the tram station is a couple of minute walk that could whisk you to there in 2 minutes. Most tourists are always talking about Sultanahmet but just on the other side of the main road from the hotel (Hotel Inter is tucked in a quiet street few meters from the main tram road) are some of the best historical sites which are just at the back of the Grand Bazaar (again, the bazaar is only 3 minutes walk from the hotel) are two magnificent mosques \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Suleymaniyah and Beyazid mosques, the University of Istanbul grounds and if you continue on walking are local bazaars where you could watch the real Istanbulites doing their daily activities less of those touristic stuff and continue on strolling and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll wind up at the Spice or Egyptian bazaar and the pigeon-full Yeni Camii or the beautiful New Mosque and fronting it is the Eminonu ferry port and the Galata Bridge that you could cross all the way to Galata tower. Took me about an hour or so to see great sites along the way from the hotel to the Galata Bridge but it was a pleasant stroll starting from the Grand Bazaar. Daily breakfasts included and fulfilling, coffee, tea juice, omelet and scrambled eggs, sausages, cheeses, butter, jams, bread, sliced oranges, cucumber, tomatoes, olives, cereals, and other stuff, that sometimes changes each day. Room size is just enough, double bed draped with clean-smelling white sheet and blanket with comfortable white pillows, a desk and chair, a small fridge, a nice small sofa that could be pulled into a lazy lounge ( I liked that!), TV with English news and other programs, dresser with an electronic safety deposit box which I did not even use. I felt secure with leaving my stuff around the room because when I left my newly bought iphone and my blackberry on top of the night table on my second day, I came back in the evening and found my room made up and both of the gadgets are exactly where I left it. I go home everynight on a clean bed and secure place. Internet connections on all floors are excellent, fast using my iphone, and it's free. Bathroom is dazzlingly clean with a hot shower stall, daily fresh-as-spring towels, liquid soaps, daily replenished tissues, hairdryer, everything works fine. The hotel staff are warm and efficient, the reception guys are welcoming and most helpful, the breakfast attendants are keen on cleaning the tables. The staff won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try to be hotel-friendly with you \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at your service! and the best part they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take you back to the airport for free! But your booking has to be 3 nights or more. Euro45/night for a single discounted if you pay cash. On my third night when I'm advised them that I will checkout because I'm supposed to be in Bursa, but I decided to return to Istanbul. I came back almost in the evening and still found my stuff in my room. There are toddlers and infants on the breakfast salon so must be good for family. Along the way to the hotel there are some street merchants selling clothes but never bothersome compared to some touts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c carpet sellers and restaurants around sultanahmet who greets people when passing by there everyday in different languages followed by a question of where you came from, and so on. There is also a restaurant few meters from the hotel and a lokantasi on the main road just in front of the Beyazid tram station near the hotel called Sar Lokantasi (local eatery that serves real Turkish fares at really affordable price, my meals of two varieties costs only about TL10). At the corner is Saray Bufe for a quick bite of sandwiches or doner kebab and on the other side of the road too beside the bazaar are several cheap eats too and the bus stops, a money changer, several atm machines and banks. The famous Koska turkish sweets store is on the main road - piece of advise: buy your sweets there instead of the airport, it's a lot cheaper. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re planning to travel to Bursa, walk down the road to the seaside about 12 minutes and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Yenikapi ferry port for those fast and comfortable catamaran ferries that travels to Yalova (70 minutes) or Guzelyali/Bursa (an hour and a half) to your way to Bursa and Iznik.

Great location, helpful staff, very punctual and friendly airport transfers, and excellent price! It is worth noting that from the descriptions on here, it sounds as though this place is located right across from the Grand Bazaar gates. As a female travelling alone for work I was a bit concerned about whether this would mean I would be hassled in the evenings from sellers or those hanging around looking for \"targets\". The hotel is actually across a main street and then down a side street and around a corner - so it was tucked into a quiet and safe nook in the city and I felt extremely comfortable coming and going in the early morning and late evening hours. Breakfast was good, although it does not change too much each day so by the end of 10 days I was a bit bored - but I think that is likely true of any hotel after 10 days. The rooms were always clean. To be clear- do not expect to be wowed by the luxury. These are simple and very small rooms (at least the singles were) but they had everything I needed and my room felt like a cosy \"home\" for the week and a half! One reviewer on here complained about people out on the street unpacking textiles and people hanging out in the lobby. Personally, I liked learning about where the textiles were going (local seamster in building across the street) as I sometimes find learning about daily life for the locals more interesting than just tourist attractions. Also, I liked that guests were comfortable hanging out together in the lobby to watch evening news or sports and I think it added to the spirit of the place. If you like that too- then this is likely more your kind of place. The best part of the hotel is definitely the owners and staff who were endlessly willing to help out - with recommendations for restaurants, attractions, setting up my internet in my room, and helping me figure out the logistics of getting to and from the conference I was attending. *Other tips: down the hill from the hotel is the Kumkapi area known for its twinkling lights and seafood restaurants. A nice evening walk, but the food was fairly standard and was even more expensive then some tourist traps, and not with the same level of service. A kebap type restaurant on the 2nd floor of a building right across from the hotel on the main side street (mithat casa cad) served fantastic food for a really great price.

To be fair, it was reasonably cheap especially you'd get 10% discount if paid by cash upon arrival, plus one way of free airport-hote / hotel-airport shuttle service. I'm honestly not a picky person, rule of thumb is to select a hotel that has a good location within the budget. Hotel facilities / restaurants never added any value in my decision making. However a few bad things that really made me not enjoying my 4 nights stay at this hotel: 1. Location - it's not as close as people described in terms of proximity to the Blue Mosque / Aya Sofia. It's about 20 mins easy pace walk. Although it is just opposite to the Grand Bazaar - but that's it. 2. Neighbourhood - Since it's close to the Grand Bazaar, people hang around that area tends to be a little poor (sorry to use such word), but I did see many beggers - including children beggers on the street. Btw, one of the children beggers actually spat on us when we walke back to the hotel one night around 8pm-ish unbelievable rude!! 3. The hotel - The nearby shops used the front of thet hotel and the hotel staircase to load / unload stuff to their lorries / shops, as well as there were some people always hanging around in the hotel lobby watching TV - I personally found that very dogey... 4. Cleaniness - The cleaners didn't do the job right - we returned to the room after the room has been tidied on the first day, we could smell someone has been smoking in our room. The day after that, the room was left with a very unpleasant smell coming from the toilet in the last 2 days of our stay, despite the cleaners have cleaned the room already. 5. Other little things - breakfast was below average, air con didn't work at all, the cup for brushing teeth was plastic (just not hygenic), staff wasn't particularly friendly...

My husband and I were looking for a budget hotel, close to the sites, and we booked this hotel based on the TripAdvisor reviews. We were not disappointed. First with booking the room. I contacted the hotel through their website and continued coorespondence via email. All coorespondence were timely and friendly. We arrived in Istanbul around noon from the overnight train from Thessaloniki. (Note: The free transportation is only for the airport, NOT the train station.) However, there is a tram station right in front of the train station, and we took it to Beyazit stop, which is only a few blocks from the hotel. Our room was not ready when we arrived, but the hotel stored our bags while we went to get some lunch nearby. Although we had requested a room with a view, there was not a 6th floor room available when we arrived. So, we got a room on the second floor for the first night, and moved to the 6th floor for the next 2 nights. The 2nd floor room was adequate for a budget room but not what we were expecting based on the raving reviews on the site. (After being moved to our 6th floor room, we assume that most of the reviews are from people staying on the top floor.) Our 2nd floor room had 2 twin beds, a small closet, a small tv. There was a view of only a concrete wall from the window. It was a very small room, but adequate to just drop your bags in and sleep at night, which is really all you will be doing at a hotel in Istanbul! The 6th floor room was much better. It had a view of the sea over the rooftops. This room was much bigger, newer, and nicer. It had hardwood floors, more closet space, a small refridgerator, a double bed and a twin bed, and a much more updated bathroom with a haridryer. Thank goodness we changed rooms! We were much happier! The breakfast was good... with an assortment of meats, olives, cheeses, cucumber, fried eggs, bread, cereal, juices, and coffee. It was a good start to the day. Location- very close to the major sites... across from the Grand Bazaar and Istanbul University, within walking distance (or a couple of tram stops) from Hagia Sophia, Sultan Ahmet Mosque, Basillica Cistern. The staff held our bags for us on the day of checkout so we could see more of the city before catching our train back to Greece. Overall, this is a good choice for a budget hotel. Just be aware that there is a big difference between the top floor rooms and the other rooms, so you won't be surprised! We would definately stay here again, and hope to return to this beautiful city soon!", "Date": "June 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sarajevo", "Title": "\u201cGreat budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "Nerman", "ReviewID": "UR16586221", "Content": "Stayed in hotel Inter for 7 nights with girlfriend.

First of all, pls make use of the airport transfer service that is complimentary for longer staying guests. Gives you a hassle-free arrival especially if you have had a long flight. Atat\u00c3\u00bcrk airport is manageable and modern, in fact it is a better stopover place compared to many outdated Southern European airports. Hotel itself is rather basic. That said, it fills the purpose extremely well, location is superb, close to everything but not directly on the main road. Do ask for rooms with a view. The local feeling at Kumkapi is just a short walking distance away and many Istanbul's tourist attractions or local transport to those is nearby. I do not agree that the breakfast is basic. There is enough supply of everything (buffet style) and you can always vary your own menu. I should say the breakfast was the highlight of every morning. Water supply in shower is more than adequate and the hotel is well maintained, towels changed daily, etc. Although not everyone speaks good English, there is always someone who does in the reception. If asked on downsides in this hotel, I really can't recall any. Perhaps they should smile more often (but then again it is Turkey and we had just stayed 2 months in Asia). You can see a lot of the Turkish way of life, nearby the hotel and I suggest you walk towards the sea. There are no tea/coffee making facilities in room, nor a refrigerator - perhaps there should be bottled water supply for hot months. The inroom safe worked oddly. Other than that, I do not really have any suggestions - very functional rooms and great bathroom. All in all, I would rate this hotel as well above the average, around 3+ stars, and considering the room rates, it gives excellent value for money. The staff helpful, even bothered to return us a cable we left in room during our first stay. I do not think that you can have better experience anywhere else in Istanbul in this price category. You need to pay several times more if you want to have higher standard rooms elsewhere and then again I'm not sure if it is worth it.

I then got the feeling that this was not an isolated case. So please be very careful when tipping staff, you may find they suddenly lose any grasp of English.

The only slight negatives were that access is via the steep and rather dirty Mithat Pa\u00c5\u0178a Caddesi, and that the lift only goes up to the 4th/5th floor (obviously only a problem if you are on the 6th floor) These are far outweighed by the positives, however. The staff were consistently polite and helpful - for example explaining the baffling system of daily passes/smart cards for the tram/metro system. All rooms were clean and well-maintained, and we were offered larger rooms when they became available, though our room was only slightly smaller than average. Some of the rooms have 17-inch LCD tvs - all rooms have a variety of local and foreign stations (cable?) The hotel is within a few minutes of the Grand Bazaar, and about 30 minutes walk from the major attractions of Sultanahmet - without charging Sultanahmet prices.

The staff were friendly enough, occasionally they smiled, however, other times they seemed completely oblivious to everything. The email replies to our booking enquiries were swift and efficient and the price was superb for the location of the hotel. They also offer a 10% discount on cash payments. The free airport transfer was great - it saved us about \u00c2\u00a310 each way in a private taxi and saved us from roaming the city of Istanbul at night! The breakfast was average with a small selection and definately wasn't the highlight of the holiday!
