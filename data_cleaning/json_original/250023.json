They have valet parking, which is cheap compared to most Chicago parking. They charge $35 for valet parking for $24 hours. I've seen parking in Chicago much higher. The room itself was small, but beautifully decorated, well maintained, and clean. We didn't mind the size of the room because we spent very little time there.

I booked the room on Hotwire, so we got a good price. Hotwire showed it as a 3 \u00c2\u00bd star hotel. I think the extra \u00c2\u00bd was generous and would call it just a 3. It is located on Wacker between Wabash and Michigan Ave. I usually try to avoid Wacker, which can be difficult to navigate when driving. Plus I like to be farther north on Michigan Avenue to be closer to the good shopping/restaurants. We didn't really interact with the staff so I can't comment on the customer service.

It's close to Wacker Drive and the room was contemporary albeit on the small side. Went out to meet a few people for dinner and we came back finding out that the AC was not working. We alerted the staff at the lobby and realized that the maintenance guy had left for the day. How can the hotel not have a maintenance person 24 hours a day? Needless to say, we were shocked to hear about it. We did not pay more than $150 and get a room that is as warm as an oven. When the staff learnt about our story, they unempathetically asked us to open the windows instead!!! Mind you, that does not make any sense considering the weather outside was about 90 F. They then offered to move us to another location away from the river but we refused because we chose the location for a reason and it is an unnecessary inconvenience to us at our expense. It was not our fault to begin with. After that they offered us a crappy fan which finally worked when we gave it a few knocks. It was a warm and miserable night for our family who came all the way to Chicago expecting something wonderful from this hotel. The next morning, we mentioned about it at the front desk again and all they could do was apologized. Not a single time did they compensate us in a form of a lower rate for putting us through this. After all, we did not sign up for a room which has AC problems. After much complains, the staff finally offer us a free upgrade if we come back the next time. That is not acceptable. What is the use of a free upgrade if the AC is not going to work?? Well, we won't be coming back anyways. He can keep his offer.

While my wife was in the shower I realized that the place didnt even have a microwave or fridge and this was a must since me and my wife were going to be doing alot of eating out and would like to bring some food home and even store drinks in. So thats when I called down to the front desk and requested a room with a microwave and fridge and thats when the front desk lady said in a very rude tone that the room I purchased did not come with those items. So I told her there must be a room that has those items and she said that I could upgrade to a Jr. Suite that also had a pullout sleeper couch (not needed since me and my wife were going to sleep in the queen size bed) and a very nice riverview, I olny had to pay $15 extra a night for this room. So I immediately jumped on this opportunity and I must say that this Jr. Suite was very well laid out the artwork and linens were very well put together and I finally had some breathing room and plenty of room for me and my wife to navigate throughout the room without bumping into each other! The view of the Chicago River was magnificent and also on the 6th floor they had the water bottle fill up station like they advertised on their website(the 32nd floor where my original room was did not have a water bottle station!!!!) stating that a water bottle station was on each floor. The bed I must say was extremely firm to the point of almost sleeping on concrete and the blanket was EXTREMELY HEAVY and felt as if we were sleeping under a pile of bricks! I couldnt sleep with it and just used the sheet. The desk area is very nice to set up the laptop and plan the activites throughout the day. A major complaint I have about the Jr. Suite is that there were two light bulbs in the room that didnt work at all the first was the night stand light on my side of the bed and the second was the Kitchenette light. I requested at the front desk that room service take care of the burnt out bulbs while we were gone for the day and to my dismay ONLY the kitchenette light was replaced and the funny thing was they left it on almost to show the great job they did replacing it. Ha. too bad they forgot my night stand lightbulb. Also when room service would come in during the day they would not give me fresh coffee cups or give us extra toilet paper.

The room was very clean and seemed newly renovated. We had originally planned to share my in-laws \"mini-suite\" on the 26th floor. That plan was scrapped when they saw how small the suite actually was. The suite is more like a small alcove studio. The couch folded out into a single bed. We were pleased to move upstairs to a reasonably priced room of our own. The first strange thing that we noticed about the room was that the queen bed was actually two twins pushed together. We would expect this in Europe, but in Chicago it seemed odd. The bump in the middle of the bed was not too imposing and the beds did not slide apart in the middle of the night (which has happened to us in this situation before). The windows in the room let in an enormous amount of light, which was wonderful. Each window had an ominous sticker on it that said 'to operate this window contact the front desk\". The windows seemed to work just fine and we opened them anyway and nothing catastrophic happened. The room had a dorm size refrigerator and a microwave which was awesome for storing left overs from dinner and chilling wine. The desk was roomy and seemed like it would be a perfect work space. The bathroom was very clean and new but it had the most bizarre shower I have ever seen in an American hotel. There was no tub (which did not bother me too much). The shower head was the kind with the hose attached. This was mounted on the long wall of the shower rather than the short end as it would normally be. The floor of the shower was the tile floor of the bathroom, separated into a \"shower section\" with a short rubber tube. The shower curtain was not long enough to reach the floor and so when you turned on the shower, the entire room was flooded with water. We quickly exhausted our ration of two bath towels, on hand towel, one wash cloth and one fabric floor mat. This made it dangerous to use a hair dryer in the room because you would likely be standing in a puddle. The only way that we could prevent this was to take team showers, one spraying the other (much like bathing a dog) being careful to direct the water into the drain. This sounds horrible, but it was so funny that we didn't care too much. The counters in the bathroom were very small which was unfortunate because that was the only spot in the room for make up and hair prep. The desk was a big space but it had no nearby mirror and the full length mirror near the closet had no nearby surface to hold primping supplies. We both commented that it seemed that the designer had not thought about what would be needed if you were actually going to be getting ready for something in this room. All in all, it seemed like this room was meant for one male business traveler who didn't use a lot of hair products. I would still recommend this hotel for couples (so long as you are not too persnickety) because the building is extraordinary and the views from the spire are romantic. The restaurant on the first floor has good food (though the service is as slow as a slug in molasses) and was fairly priced. There are laundry facilities in the hotel (that appear to be free) and cute bottled water dispensers on a few floors. There is a free computer lab on the first floor which we used quite a bit for information and for checking into our flight. The staff was extremely friendly and they removed a mistaken charge from our bill at my first request. We would definitely stay here again but we don't think that this hotel is for everyone.", "Date": "June 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "zambiancdn", "Title": "\u201cPoor Value for Money and Tiny Tiny Room\u201d", "Author": "zambiancdn", "ReviewID": "UR32537329", "Content": "River Hotel is priced like most Chicago hotels - expensive - almost 200/night, but doesn't deliver anywhere near the service expected for that service.

As with any hotel, know what YOU need to be happy. For me, this was the perfect hotel for a solo trip. I was attending a conference held at another hotel nearby that actually wanted more than twice the price for a room. The building was built in the 1920s and little touches still show that - marble in unexpected places, small elevators. My room was small, yes, but everything was clean and in good condition - nice bed linens, nice carpet and wall covering, attractive furniture. I had a bed, two night tables, an armchair, and a wall-mounted TV. And a superb little desk with an ergonomic chair. That's what made me happiest - a work space where I could actually work! Lots of natural light, good bright desk lamp, plenty of outlets, a dictionary and thesaurus, and free wireless internet!! (This is not a standard feature at many other hotels in the area.) Also, the lobby has two computers, a printer, and fax, and even though they're not the newest, fastest models, just having that free access is another big bonus. The room was on the front of the building and had a nice view of the canal. The bathroom had a large walk-in shower with a shower head that adjusts every way imaginable. (If you require a tub, you might be disappointed, but I was fine.) The bathroom also had an easy-to-figure-out heater that made it nice and toasty. There was only one problem the first morning, a hairline crack in the shower head that allowed water to drip out. I let the front desk know. Not only did they offer to move me to another room if I wanted (which I didn't, the room was fine otherwise!) but I gave them my schedule and they had the maintenance guys in to fix it while I was gone from the room so there was no inconvenience. As so many other reviews mention, there is a fill-your-own-bottle water station by the elevator (they provide bottles). There is also a courtesy closet if you just want to grab an extra towel or pillow. If you're used to being waited on hand and foot, this might be off-putting, but I love the freedom of just walking down the hall and getting whatever I need whenever I need it. In the room, there was also a little fridge and microwave, though I think that varies room to room. If you want a taxi or help with your bags, they can take care of that. I prefer to walk, and there are several good places to eat within a one-block radius, including an Italian-style restaurant essentially attached to the hotel. Other quick notes: construction crews are doing some work on the lower floors, which I didn't even notice until I took the stairs and smelled the paint.

Unfortunately the hotel itself isn't fantastic and has some significant drawbacks even for business travelers. Read on for more... LOCATION: The hotel is located on the southern bank of the river, less than a block off of Michigan Avenue. With easy access to the El (CTA) trains from the State terminal, and the main business district within a 2 minute walk, the hotel is perfectly situated for business or pleasure travelers, whatever your goals in downtown Chicago. ROOMS: The rooms are basically postage stamps. Long and narrow, with the bathroom at one end and a single window facing the world on the other, the bed(s) fill nearly the width of the room. Each has two nightstands and a desk/workstation with a pull-out laptop desk. The TV is mounted above the work area, pointed generally at the bed. The bathroom contains a curtained shower stall, not a full tub. AMENITIES: Club Quarters certainly strives to provide a sense of luxury and up-scale hospitality, but the results are half-hearted at best. Many floors offer \"bottled water\" complimentary in the elevator lobby -- however, their definition of \"bottled water\" is providing empty bottles which you can fill from a dispenser installed in the wall. All rooms have wireless internet, but it is 802.11B for the geeks out there -- which is to say rather slow. Their coverage and external Internet connection is pretty spotty as well, as even when signal is available, Internet access is terribly slow. The main lobby seems particularly afflicted. While there is an Italian restaurant attached to the hotel at street level, it stops serving at 10:00 PM. The only food options to be had in the late evening are take-out from nearby restaurants, which the hotel will charge $2.50 to deliver to your room. Unfortunately, the mid-week operating times listed in their foodservice menu seem to be out-of-date, and the two Asian style restaurants I called would not deliver at 9:30 PM, even though they were advertised to be open until 10:30 or later. STAFF: The staff was generally personable, but seemed more concerned with security than guest services. The building seems to host offices on the side opposite the hotel rooms, and so lobby staff accost you for a room key or luggage check tag anytime you walk through the front door. Considering that you need a keycard to activate the elevators at all, this is a level of paranoia that seems somewhat misplaced. Nonetheless, they effectively addressed the one issue I encountered during my stay, and were generally pleasant if not overly service-oriented. Overall, this is basically a place to sleep... Their great downtown location is by far their largest asset, and the room was clean and comfortable, even if cramped. If you're planning to not spend much time in your room, this would be a great place to base out of for a business or leisure trip.

I booked on Travelocity after missing out on the price I was after for the Courtyard River North. I wasn't sure what to expect after reading so many mixed reviews, but we were very pleased with this hotel for how we used it - to sleep in and shower and dress for the day/evening. We were on the 16th floor and had a beautiful view of the river, the Trump Tower and the Wrigley Building. The room was smaller than most places we've stayed before, but the price we got it for more than made up for that (around $85 a night with a flight/hotel package). A good description for it would be that it was reminiscent of London hotels, if any of you have ever experienced hotels across the pond. I do think that this may have been a little larger than that, but it reminded us so much of them. The bathroom had a spacious stand-in shower and a smallish sink/countertop. Plenty of room for what we needed. This is primarily a business traveler's hotel. The only furniture in it was the two nightstands, the bed, a chair with a foldout laptop desk on the side and then a small dresser with the TV by it. This hotel is kind of quirky in that one side of the hotel stays cold while the other can't catch up, no matter what temperature you set on your thermostat. It did bother us one night, but with it being April, we had the maintenance man open the windows for us and it was very pleasant. This would've been quite a problem in the summer. If you have to stay in the summertime, I would recommend asking for a room on the cooler side. I had read horror stories about the elevators and them taking extraordinarily long times. We never encountered this, but I do wonder if it's because we weren't there in the middle of peak tourist season. You have to swipe your room key to get to get the lobby elevator in motion... I like that feature. By each floor's elevators, they have racks of empty plastic bottles above a pure, cool water dispenser. This was a VERY nice feature that I have never encountered before. It was great in April and I can only imagine how great it would've been in July. The hotel is in a truly magnificent (pun intended) location. You are on the same block as a Walgreen's if you forget any toiletries or need any medication, etc. And, you are only 3 or 4 blocks from the Loop trains (about 6 or 7 from the Blue Line to and from O'Hare). And, of course, you are within a stone's throw of North Michigan Avenue and all that it entails. You are also just a few blocks from the theater district, the business district and Marshall Field's, etc. All in all, this hotel was an incredible buy for what we needed it for and for the time in which we were there. The temperature issue would be HUGE in the hotter months. I would stay here again in a heartbeat, especially in the cooler months.", "Date": "April 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dudley, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cConfined to quarters\u201d", "Author": "Ormstein", "ReviewID": "UR14320415", "Content": "Working in Chicago the Club Quarters on Wacker was notably cheap on my company travel agents list and it was local to where I would be working so I tried it.

My husband did not get a ticket at the parking garage and when he inquired about it at the office in the parking garage the girl told him not to worry about it. Well on Sunday morning when he tried to get our car back it was an issue. You have to have a ticket to be able to get your car back. After about 15 minutes the issue was resolved and we got our car back. The entire staff was very helpful including the doorman. He was very helpful in getting us a cab. He ran down at least a block and flagged down a cab, he got in the cab with the driver and came back to the hotel so we could get our cab.

It was very close to good restaurants, to the conference I was attending at the Hyatt, and to the Miracle Mile for shopping! There was a good-sized bathroom with a great shower and very comfy pillows on the bed. The downside is this: A \"suite\" is really just a regular-sized hotel room -- the rooms at Club Quarters are teeny-tiny. When I got off the elevator onto the 14th floor, it smelled like smoke. There was also a little \"open refrigerator\" built into the wall across from the elevator that contained what I thought were bottles of water, which I loved because I drink a lot of water throughout the day. But when I went to get one, I found that they were empty water bottles that you could refill using the provided \"nozzles\" like you would find in the door of a refrigerator. However, I didn't know how well the bottles were cleaned and didn't take one. I instead would refill my own water bottle when I needed to. When I got into my room, it was a bit musty smelling, and some of the furniture, like the shelf at the head of the bed, hadn't been dusted in ages. I could literally mark a line in the dust with my finger. There was a stain on the carpet, the phone next to the bed didn't work, the toilet was in need of fixing because it wouldn't flush and just kept running. It kind of gave me the heebie-jeebies, but I was in town for a conference, there was no availability for less than $450 anywhere else, and I figured it was just for 2 nights, so I'd tough it out. There was also no in-room safe, so I had to reserve a safe-deposit box. Each time I had to access it, I had to wait for a staff member to become available to get it for me, which was a little inconvenient. There was an exercise room in the basement level of the hotel. It was small, the equipment was ancient, and the weight bench had a broken seat. Also, the ventilation wasn't great, and the temperature was 78 degrees with no hope of cooling off. That said, it was still possible to get a good work out in. The sign said that the gym didn't open til 6 a.m., but if you needed to work out earlier than that, the staff would open the room for you. I alerted them to the state of my room, and everything was cleaned or fixed within a few hours, so I have to say that they were very responsive.

Spacious, huge bed that was very comfortable, fridge, big shower and above all the great view that took in the Wrigley and Tribune buildings just across the street. It is worth knowing that this hotel seems to be in 2 halves - the upper and the lower! Our room was on floor T30 - and I assume that T stands for Tower. The building is like a normal big square tower block for the first 25 or so floors, and then changes into a tall thin tower with just 3 rooms on each floor. We were on the 30th floor in the tower, and therefore had a large room with huge windows and great views - so I guess that other reviewers who commented on the small windows might have been on lower floors. Think we were just lucky with our room, but it might be worth asking the reception to place you in a tower room with a river view as we were thrilled with our room. Others have commented on the construction noise - and it is true that Donald Trump's latest building (which will be one of the tallest in Chicago) is being built directly opposite this hotel. However, the noise from the construction site was not enough to wake us up or disturb us at all. The lounge in the hotel was nice and never busy, with 3 PC's with free internet access, some comfortable sofas and a big TV. One drawback is the lift/elevator.

There's a housekeepers cupboard on every floor, so if you need extra coffee or towels etc, you can help yourself (I found that out after not being left coffee one morning!). The staff were polite and the housekeepers came a little early (my opinion anyway), but they were very accommodating when we asked for an extra half hour to finish getting ready!

We were only in Chicago for 5 days, and so didn't manage to see everything, but we WALKED everywhere, to Lincoln Zoo and to the Adler planetarium etc etc. it really wasn't too far and a very pleasant walk.

(And a coat it gets pretty chilly!)). There are loads of great steak houses nearby as well as all sorts of other restaurants. We were spoilt for choice in the time that we had! My only complaint would be that even though we prepaid online, the hotel withheld the credit on my card without telling me. Now i'm not the most frequent traveller so i don't know if this is usual, but as nowhere seemed to accept debit cards (although my bank said they would) I had to rely on my credit card or cash. This caused a rather embarrassing situation when my card failed to make a payment at the signature lounge restaurant at the top of the John Hancock building, and I had to leave my wife at the table while I travelled down 94 floors to find a cash point!! So maybe just bear that in mind and save yourself the embarrassment! But otherwise a great place to have as a base of operations whilst visiting the windy city. P.S.

CHECK-IN Quick, unremarkable experience. ROOM The room was smaller than I expected and had a 'dorm' feel to it - oddly shaped. Closet was small, only a few hangers. No drawers to unpack - but only staying for two nights so not that big of a deal. Cold outside and hot in the room, so I adjusted the room temp, but it would never come on. Oddly enough, the windows in the room opened (on the 21st floor if I remember correctly), but a sticker on the window said to call the front desk to open the window. Maintenance came within 10 minutes of calling to open the window and that was how I managed the temp. I guess I should have asked him to show me how to work the temp control, but I wanted fresh air once I realized that was an option. The bathroom is small, also found the coffee maker over toilet odd, also only had decaf the first a.m. and was running late so didn't call for regular coffee - but regular coffee was restocked with room service. Bed was comfortable, but coverlet was oddly worn and reminded me of a guest bedroom bedspread instead of hotel linen. Tested the alarm clock to make sure it worked - and it didn't, so I set the alarm on my cell phone instead. I also didn't report the alarm clock didn't work since I had a very easy work-around. LOBBY RESTAURANT Overpriced, but good. Small portions. Drinks a little overpriced. Ate there the first night (it was very cold outside and snowy and you didn't have to go outside to get to the restaurant). Suffice it to say my second night I found a chain restaurant a block away. LOBBY Was on the business trip alone, so preferred not to stray too far from the hotel. Second night, ate at a chain restaurant a block away, and upon returning to the hotel didn't want to be cramped in the small room watching tv, so I decided to check out the lobby. There is a small 'library' sitting area that has a TV, coffee machine, gas or electric fireplace, magazines, and a few books. However, on a night where it was 10 degrees out, I got a glass of wine for the lobby restaurant (they were kind enough to let me take the glass out to the lobby with me) and sit in front of the fire and read. Never before have I 'hung-out' in a hotel lobby before, but really it was cozy in an odd kind-of way! WORK-OUT ROOM Small, several machines, TV, water-cooler, towels. Not bad for a quick work-out. LOUNGE Not sure what to call this - a few PC's available, but quiet and easy to get online for free since I choose to not bring my own laptop. No wireless connections for those that do from what I could tell. CHECK-OUT Quick, didn't look to see if there was automatic on the TV, just stopped at the little desk on the way out and checked out, less than 2 minutes to accomplish.

It was a strange shape, so I can't be exact, but certainly less 100 square feet. There was a desk and a full-sized bed, but no dresser or bureau to unpack our bag. So it stayed packed and put away, as there was no floor space big enough for it (and this was a caryy-on bag). The closet had two hangars, so I guess the businessmen who stay here are only staying for one night and keep an extra pair of socks in their suit pockets. Amenities were extremely basic: hair dryer and coffee pot in the bathroom (am I the only one who finds a coffee pot over the toilet a little gross?); shampoo; one soap; mouthwash; iron and ironing board; TV; phone. That's it. Housekeeping was spotty. We got three bath towels, one hand towel and no washcloths. Their guidebook said there was a closet on each floor with extra blankets and towels, but the one on our floor was deadbolted. Check-in was fine, but oddly they didn't offer any sort of automatic checkout. Again, that struck me as odd for a hotel catering to business travelers who probably don't want to wait in line to leave in the morning.

On the other hand, there were several panels of windows with good views, including part of Millenium Park.

It really is pretty ideal for the business road warrior with queen bed, lots of outlets, and desk. For a weekend get away kind of place, I wouldn't recommend it. It just lacked any ambiance, had a small room, and a smaller shower only bathroom. It was ok just not great.", "Date": "October 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGood location, clean rooms\u201d", "Author": "MNCondoDude", "ReviewID": "UR3906221", "Content": "I stayed at the hotel for a week in late August. I knew that rooms were considered small be some reviewers, but I did not find them to be cramped. The check-in/check-out procedure was good. The public areas were fine. I normally had no problem getting to use a computer in the public area. My room was clean and generally well kept by staff. The location is great if you walk, use public transit or the trolley system (paid one) for tourists. The hotel has a small bar and the restaurant is fine. My only concern would be as construction on Trump Tower across the river progresses that noise levels may get high. It was not a problem at my visit. I had a fine few of the Chicago River. My visit was good and I would stay again. it is not an awesome experience, but it did not create stress or disappoint.", "Date": "September 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Clean, Modern\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3836045", "Content": "Got this room for $60 a night. It's right on Wacker and Michigan - so convenient for all the shopping and an excellent location. As stated the rooms aren't large, but I was by myself so I didn't mind, although even if I had my partner with me I still think it would be fine. The most important thing for me as a single traveller though was that it was clean, bright and very safe feeling. The bathroom was very clean and modern (I can't stand fusty old bathrooms), the bed was comfy, you get a desk with wireless access and TV, Microwave and Fridge. So very happy with the room. The service was also very good and efficient. They even let me leave my baggage with them a week later when I was back in Chicago even though I didn't stay with them that night. The Italian cafe attached is excellent! I had great pasta and salad there and the service was fantastic. All in all a great stay for the price. The corner cafe also does great breads.", "Date": "September 1, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "River Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d250023-Reviews-River_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html", "Price": "$134 - $299*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">75 East Wacker Drive</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">(also known as Club Quarters)</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Chicago</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">IL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">60601</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "250023", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/27/29/272943044494603b000926f16e95d2ba1large.jpg"}}
