The main square just down the road is great if you want to catch the tour busses around the city. The hotel itself is a little dated yes, but there is nothing wrong with that. And yes it is extremely pink in the bedrooms but it is 'traditional spanish decor'. We had a sun-sol room which had a view over the street and a lovely large window. The only problem with the room was one night there was an usual and extremely loud noise coming from what seemed to be above. I couldn't sleep and it went on for about an hour. This may have been a one off I don't know, but at three in the morning it's not exactly what you want. The hotel does include food and drink. The drinks included are coffee, water, coke, soft drinks, wine, beer, ice tea and a couple other (which were not in use at the time). The wine isn't great but it was nice to come back to a beer after a long day walking around. The food was not anything special, but was perfect for a little six o clock snack (seeing as they eat at about nine in barcelona!). I am a huge foodie so I was always planning on eating out anyway. The staff were great and very helpful, always greeted with a smile. Next time I will probably stay in a hotel closer to the port, just so i can explore that part of the city next time.

We arrived in this hotel the second week of November after spending a week in Madrid and I was very impressed by the excellent location of the hotel. The hotel is located in the very sophisticated area of Eixample. The hotel is 10 minutes away from Plaza Catalu\u00f1a and five minutes away from La Gran Via. Actually is located in Las Ramblas Catalu\u00f1a. The staff is very friendly and they provided great service, they were always on top of everything. During our stay we were in room 136 and it was a charming room. This room has a big window but unfortunately we could not open the window completely. There are not rails outside of the window, so the window has a lock that only allows you to open the window a little bit. If you actually open the window completely you will fall out into the street. The room had a LCD TV, microwave, mini refrigerator and a safety box. Our bed was big, tall and comfortable. One thing that I want to mention is that if you are a petite person or a person with mobility issues, you might need to request a room with a short bed. The bed in this room was very height and even though I\u2019m 5.2\u201d I had troubles getting into the bed. The first two nights, I felt like I was sleeping on top of a table because of the bed\u2019s height. Our room had a very interesting bathroom. The bathroom\u2019s design is like a box with a glass ceiling inside of the bedroom (see the pictures). There are no windows in the bathroom and there is no exhausts fan so the bathroom and the bedroom were filled with steam every time that we took a shower. What was worse for me was that for those moments when we had to use the toilette, the other person had to leave the room, for a little while, so whoever was using the toilette could open the room\u2019s window so the fresh air could come into the room and remove the bad odors. I know that the hotel is trying to protect the room\u2019s ceiling and the wall d\u00e9cor which are charming, but they really need to install some exhaust fans in the bathroom. In general, our experience at the Continental Palacete was a very pleasant experience.

The sitting lounge is so baroquely beautiful and was a great place to meet with our group of friends who traveled together. The included white or rose wine on tap, juices, Pepsi's and Estrella Damm beer, plus the nuts, olives, etc. made for a terrific happy hour. We were surprised at the selection of hot foods prepared at lunch - rice or pasta dishes, chicken, veggies, and all were yummy. Loved the selection of delicious breads as well. Yes, the rooms are a bit small and pink, but the beds were firm and comfy and everything you could need was there. A big plus was that our rooms were ready when we arrived on both mornings. The girls at the desk couldn't have been more helpful, from offering recommendations for dining out to giving directions to attractions. Another plus is that there is a taxi stand just across the corner, making it very convenient for getting to the port or airport. I should point out that there are about 10 steps to negotiate with your luggage before you get to the small elevator, so this could be a problem for those with poor mobility.

The hotel may be viewed in detail on its own website, showing pictures which faithfully reflect reality. The rooms are of three sizes, we took a mid sized room (137), with a closed balcony on the Ramblas Catalunya street, very well protected from the noise. Hotel offers a 24hr excellent full buffet for breakfast and either a light lunch or dinner, with more than enough liquids to satisfy all tastes, including water, orange juice, milk, and a wide variety of sodas and coffees). The room came equipped with a flat screen television with radio, alarm clock, hair dryer and free internet (wifi and cable) using your own computer or two available from the hotel. But what we appreciated most was the decoration, original Versailles/Vienna styles in the public areas. The hotel resulted from the adaptation of a private home moved to its present location in its entirety, faithfully replacing every single piece to match the original construction. Although we visited many wbsites offering Barcelona hotels, we decided on Venere.com to make the reservation because of its convenience of use and price, as well as ease of cancellation if necessary. However, reserving directly with the hotel, through its website, or by telephone (skype) and fax is equally adequate and more personal. In our case, we reserved many months in advance with Venere and later cleared up some details and confirmed our arrival directly with the hotel by email and skype. Finally, the family also owns and manages the Continental Barcelona hotel about 1 block from Plaza Catalunya (Palacete is 3 blocks away) on the Ramblas itself. A little larger and not so elegantly decorated, it is usually full because of its proximity to the Ramblas. We preferred the Palacete and would again choose it on a return trip.

The location is very good, close to catalunya square and the Ramblas. We took a bus from the airport to Catalunya square and wheeled our bags a few blocks down to the hotel. Wasn't that bad, just don't carry very heavy bags, as the hotel does not have any bellhop to carry your bags for you and you do have to carry your bags up to the top landing where there is a quaint little pulley to take you upto the main floor. The hotel is very small, must have been an old palazzo residence or made to look like one, as the suite room we stayed in was decorated like a parlor. For 4 people they only have 2 suites which consists of basically a small parlor with 2 roll away beds, a sitting area, and a fireplace, beautifully decorated with gilt mirrors and high ceilings. Leading off this parlor is a small bedroom only big enough to hold a double/queen bed and a small dresser and fridge. Next to the bed is the bathroom which is extremely tight. The room was quaint and looked down onto the street which was quite busy even late in the night. Right next to the suite room was the common dining area, where one can have coffee, tea, sodas and snacks all day long. there were 3 tiny balconies with tables also looking out onto the street, for a blissful morning cuppa. A word of advise, don't expect much in terms of food. It is just a breakfast bar with some snacks throughout the day. The menu never changed, but included egg omelets, boiled,egg quiches, some kind of salads, different dried nuts, cereals, fruits, yogurts,milk, tea, coffee, soft drinks, water and juice. There are only 2 or people working here, one at the front desk, one in the little kitchen behind the snack bar and maybe a maintenance person. Couldn't really complain. Except that when we were back home we got an unexpected high charge on our credit card from them, which after investigating was for broken down air conditioning which was not even our doing. so a word of caution- never give out info about 2 cards. One can walk down all the way down the Ramblas to the waterfront and the Columbus monument. Plus it was a block turn away from Casa Battlo and La Pedrera, Antonio Gaudi's famous residences. Down the Ramblas one can divert to the Barri Gottic neighborhood. The Ramblas is lined with tapas/Paella bars, restaurants and roadside entertainment. The hotel is also close to the red and blue bus lines which is a very convenient way to see Barcelona, and the stops are close to the hotel or get down at Plaza catalunya which is 2 blocks from the hotel. we walked quite a bit down the side streets and main roads to explore.

We selected this hotel based on the many reviews in Trip Advisor. We were very letdown. The entry way is not dissimilar to a freight elevator, three flights up, around a corner, through a non-descript doorway around another corner and you enter the very small lobby. There you encounter Peter at the desk. Very polite and friendly (though a bit obsequious). We were assigned our room with balcony overlooking Las Ramblas. The room was overwhelmingly PINK and pretty small, but clean with a decent-sized bath. The bed was exceedingly hard - two twins pushed together to form a \"queen\". Between street noise and the bed, sleep was fitful, even after the 7+ hour flight from JFK. One of the perks of the hotel is free-wifi, which I couldn't get, but they had a computer in the lobby for guests' use, so rather than being in the comfort of my room to stay abreast of communications, I was in the small lobby. Another perk, based upon the reviews in TA was the buffet and the free beer and wine and cookies, etc. throughout the day, etc. The breakfast buffet was less than enticing, so we settled for dry cereal. Of the other free items, we tried the red wine, which was not \"tinto\" but some hybrid between a rose and a red. In any case, one sip was enough. We were fortunate though, as I had originally booked three nights, post-cruise at this hotel. I was able to cancel the reservation while there and book the Royal Ramblas thru Expedia (shamelessly using the hotel's computer in the lobby) for substanially less $$. Overall, the location is very good, but I paid over $50 more per night here than I paid nearly directly across the street for our post-cruise stay at the Royal Ramblas, which was a far better and more comfortable property. So, I'd forgo the free buffet and wifi and stay at the Royal. There is free wi-fi at an \"Irish pub\" just muintes down Las Ramblas and into the Bari Gotic (good snack food, lively staff and customers and decent house wine too). And for breakfast and/or a light lunch there is a quaint little place called Pa Pastes Cafe off Carrer de Santa Anna (directly across Las Rambls from the Royal Hotel). It's in 1 block from Las Ramblas. A very good bet for a light breakfast and light lunch. For a true \"local\" dinner or lunch that is a good value just a block from Las Ramblas, try Julivert Meu. It's below street level on Carrer Bonsucces and is crowded with locals and tourists alike. It's convenient and cozy and is not an over-priced tourist trap that you'd find on Las Ramblas (e.g. Cerveceris, which was pricey and came complete with an overbearing and annoying \"manager\" who chose to stand in front of our table and regale us with his tales of Seattle in the 70's any time food was put before us).", "Date": "March 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm", "Title": "\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d", "Author": "Saffolein", "ReviewID": "UR58354883", "Content": "120 EUR for a double bed room, with that standard?

We fled after one night there, to the hotel described above. In all fairness; if I'd been a student, travelling with an equally poor friend, and the room had been 70 EUR (tops) a night, then it would've been an ok place to stay. The location is EXCELLENT, right by La Rambla and everything, and the entrance looks very nice - rather misleading, if you ask me. The main room smells of old ciggarette-smoke, and the buffet was really scary - even compared to the school cafeteria. It's a 24 h buffet or something, so the food sits there in its pots that are refrigerated, but still... looked creepy with its bulty plastic lids. And on top of that, you had to eat on paper plates and creepy mustard yellow trays... no no no. I'm usually pretty flexible person, but this was my limit. Ok if it were a cheap place, but... The bedroom was cute, indeed, and REEEEEALLY PINK. I like pink! Alot. So that was ok, a fun thing. Bu they really were very very small, and I'm still a very small person of only 5ft /153cm, hehe. But if they would've gone the whole way with the style, it would've been pretty cool. Instead, the drawers were simply transparent plastic boxes. It was so tacky. The view was a nasty old poster or something, with big flowers on, that they had hung on the brick wall right outside the windows. That was kind of funny, actually. :) So we found a different hotel that very night, not bc this one was unbareable or anything, but because we passed by a hotel so much nicer, fresher, bigger, more modern, bigger, and higher standard, for the same price (sure, no food included, but I barely ate anything from Palacete's buffet anyway...).", "Date": "March 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worcestershire", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for City sightseeing\u201d", "Author": "tedleyhorse", "ReviewID": "UR53919099", "Content": "Charming and a bonus for us!

So we looked forward to 2 1/2 days of exploring Barcelona. Go to bed at 2pm having just arrived in Barcelona, Spain. NO WAY! We got out and hit the bricks. Walking, looking at the most amazing Spanish architecture. Hundreds of people walking the streets at any hour of the day or night. They walk so fast if you are playing \"tourist\" get out of the fast lane of the sidewalks and streets. OK. Back to the Continental Palacete. The hotel buffet is accommodating. Fresh brewed coffee on demand. Juices. A drink fountain machine for: Milk, Juice, wine (three types, red, dry white and sweet wine) There is a slide open fridge case below holding bottled water, cans of Pepsi, and some wonderful Spanish beer. All part of your all inclusive room price. Fresh breads and cheese, 2 large toasters, 6 kinds of breakfast cereal olives, jams, spreads and more in the cool buffet. It not a dinner folks, but you will not be hungry while staying at Continental Palacete Each morning they cook a Barcelona version of eggs and bacon, ham and potatoes. With free Internet PC in the sitting room you can keep in touch with who ever you need to keep in touch. The large high ceiling grand ball room is the place to sit and met and talk, It has 3 balconies with a small table and 2 chairs where you can sit and sip your fave 24 hours a day. . you choose. Being on massive jet lag we loved the area at 1, 2, 3, am and even found folks (including my wife) there at 4am drinking coffee, juice, wine or having a snack. All in all.

All of the previous reviews accurately expound on the wonderful features of the property, including the extensive convenience and value of the buffet, the beautiful sitting/dining room, the helpfulness of the staff, and the excellent location. Prior to booking I read reviews that warned that interior rooms should be avoided. I should have heeded the reviews and booked another hotel when I was told that none of the exterior rooms were available. There was absolutely no problem with noise (as stated in some reviews). The beds were very comfortable. The bathrooms were very good by European standards. But when the rooms are described as small, this isn't just small by European standards. Our room literally only fit the bed and two tiny plastic nightstands (the room was equipped with a king size bed----it would have been better with a full). Although there is a \"patio\", it doesn't provide much more space, light or air as the patio is more of a boxed-in cell---no view, no window, no air. In spite of daily attempts to upgrade, we were unable to move as Barcelona was Hopping that week. In sum, unless you truly do not care about the room itself, this hotel is a great choice.
