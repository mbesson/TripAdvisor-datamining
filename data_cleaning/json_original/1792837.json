Location, location, location! This is what sells this hotel. It is very close to Taxim Square, and very close to Istiklal street which is the major shopping area and a large pedestrian zone with lots of restaurants and cafes. From this location it is very easy to get into the other parts of the city by public transportation, from shopping areas, to the old city. From the top floor restaurant you can enjoy a perfect view of the Bosphorus and the Old city. I recommend going up there before sunrise, climb up to the top floor restaurant Skyfish (which will be closed at the time), push open the glass door and sneak inside the restaurant. Then: enjoy watching one of the most beautiful cities in the world at sunrise, along with the light show on the Europe-Asia bridge. Don't tell anyone that I told you this! Location, location... ROOMS: small, but this is not a problem if you are in Istanbul for sightseeing and shopping (which most people are). They are dark, however, and the lighting in the rooms is so awkwardly laid out and weak that there is no way that you can see enough to read, and also be careful not to lose or step on your cell-phone or camera if it ends up on the floor. I heard that some of the rooms were VERY small. This was not a problem for me because I used the hotel only for sleep-over and breakfast, most of the time I was out, sightseeing and shopping. I didn't try to run inside the room or something like that. It was big enough for its purpose. Cleanliness: OK, Size: a bit small. Lighting: completely insufficient. Wireless internet: available and free of charge, but very slow. BATHROOM: a bit small, but nicely decorated. The soaps were not replaced as often as they should have been, so I had to ask the staff for them. They didn't make any problems, but obviously needed a nudge. They cleaned the bathroom and replaced the towels regularly. BREAKFAST: very good. The Turks have an excellent and rich cuisine, and this was no exception. Food quality and freshness: very good. Staff in the restaurant: pleasant, kind, friendly, efficient. I wouldn't recommend the orange juice, though. It was obviously just a diluted syrup. Take coffee, or milk, or tea, or plain water instead. GENERAL CLEANLINESS: quite OK. STAFF IN GENERAL: nice, friendly, professional, but not over the top. Points for them: 4 out of 5. SLEEP QUALITY: fine, and as can be expected at the hotel at this location. You cannot expect a hotel located in the center of the city to be as quiet as the one in the forest in the Alps. I was so exhausted and tired every night that I slept like a baby. I was on the 3rd floor, so the noise from the disco did not bother me so much. I also understand from other reviews that the noise from a music school just across was annoying for them. Well, if you come to Istanbul, go out and enjoy this beautiful city. Do not stay in your room all day, so that noise from the music school will not bother you. If you come to Istanbul and spend your days sitting in your room, and complaining about the noise, the size of the rooms and so on, you should have stayed at home! Back to sleep quality. Beds: OK. Pillows: OK. Sheets: OK. Cleanliness: OK. PRICE: the hotel is a bit overpriced, but you tend to forget that once you start to appreciate its excellent location and an OK service and room quality and cleanliness (and very good food, of course). I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Istanbul.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Varna, Bulgaria", "Title": "\u201cno parking\u201d", "Author": "Stefan V", "ReviewID": "UR119943267", "Content": "Drive one hour to get to the hotel, no parking space to park the cars are arranged in four rows of three cars bumper to bumper, spoke to the receptionist that I had to leave early, they just shrugged and said \"this is the situation \"We need to leave keys to move if necessary.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina", "Title": "\u201cDisaster, be carefull!!\u201d", "Author": "CMustafa", "ReviewID": "UR118305093", "Content": "I have experienced a terible sitauation in this hotel, so anybody please be careful.

Friendly staff, nice decor and very good breakfast. However stayed in what could be described as the smallest room in the world without exaggeration. Could have been roomier if they had been a bit clever when decorating - e.g hanging the lamp from ceiling instead and putting a shelf at the wall below the TV instead of using space for a table. Oh yes - it was so small that the bell boy had to step out of the room before I could get in!! :D Also to get into the amazing shower (very good!) I had to climb over the toilet as the door to the shower was attached the wrong way around... Anyway despite all that - lovely hotel. Very central location and easy to find.
