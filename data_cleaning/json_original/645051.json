We heard kids running laps around the room above us all frigin night (the desk took care of it but only after I called them at midnight). 2nd the couch was in very bad need of replacement. The cushions were severly \"injured\" making the couch pretty darn uncomfortable. 3rd the bathroom is terribly small. I think the clearance between the tip of the toilet and the door was maybe (and I really mean maybe) 1/4 of an inch. When I opened the door I had to step into the shower so that I could turn around and close the door. Not that big a deal but really made me laugh everytime I went to use the restroom.

The bathroom sink was outside the bath area which was nice, but they really didnt plan this well. We had a view from our top floor room(floor 7) of the Universal Park and could clearly see Hogwart Castle from our room. I was taken back some when I mentioned this to those working the front desk and they assured me that was impossible. How could they be so mis informed as you can see the castle and many of the rides from our hotel window. They have a descent breakfast but nothing hot except toast..no danish, cinnamon rolls , only donuts .It would have been nice if they invested into a waffle maker and some nice pastries. Why they don't? Easy..they sell them extra for a insane price. The coffee was great however and all that I enjoyed. So, unless you are into cereal, runny oatmeal(awlful). and toast and powered donuts, just crab some coffee and forget this breakfast..I've had better at Comfort Inns even..

The hotel is located seriously across the street from Universal Studios. According to the staff, its about a 20 minute walk. Speaking about the staff, they were probably one of the nicest hotel staff I've ever encountered (even at 1am on a Thursday for our late check-in). The rooms are very roomy. They come with a nice desk that you can work from, a small refrigerator/sink area, a large sofa in the \"living room\" area that converts to a sofa bed. I loved the 42\" TV!! The bed/bedding were HEAVENLY. We really could of slept all day on it. The bathroom although small wasn't so much of an inconvenience although a slightly larger one would be better of course. The sink is located outside from the bathroom but that wasn't an issue for us either. The only critic my gf had was that the room didn't posses enough cabinents to put our clothes away. Getting into the hotel by the side (non-main entrances) was a little difficult and took several unsuccessful room key swipes before we got the hang of it. We never had the free continental breakfast so I can't review that, however we did use the microwave in there (There wan't one in the room). We also didn't order any room service/Starbucks although both are available 24 hours and by the looks of it had a great selection. They also had a bar that served drinks until midnight. There is a TGI Fridays located on the grounds of the hotel next door (5 minute walk max) which is a good option for dine in or pick up. We went to the pool area just to smoke a cigarette and never got in although it looked very clean. A tad bit small but nothing out of the ordinary. All and all this is mainly a business oriented hotel but I didn't mind that one bit. Free (and quick) Wi-Fi as well as free wireless printing thru their print-me station (which came in handy to print out our Sea World Tickets).

They did point us to some nice local restaurants while they found us a room. The room was nice and affordable for the rate we received considering it had a fridge, couch, TV and king bed.

The shuttle arrived at Universal (sometimes late) and passengers had seconds to board before the shuttle departs. We missed the shuttle on the second night as my wife and I were heading to the shuttle and it departed as soon as it had arrived!

LOCATION - Mileage-wise, Hyatt is close - as they say \"across the street\". But the street is almost the width of a highway and is not really pedestrian friendly. And when it is 90 degrees out, you really don't feel like walking. The free shuttle only runs twice in the morning and twice in the evening, and the times don't coincide with the park hours. so if you want to get there before the park opens (to beat the lines at Harry Potter), or stay there past 7pm, you have to walk in the hot weather or take a cab. And you have to wait 10 min from the time the front desk calls the cab to come. and when none of taxi drivers even know WHERE the Hyatt Place is, you know you've picked the wrong hotel. BREAKFAST - nice that they provide free continental breakfast but not the place to be if you want a hot breakfast. There is a TGIFridays next door but breakfast buffet there is horrible CLEANLINESS - agree with other reviewers that that carpet was gross and the couch felt grimy. the room had a musty smell and humid feel. the A/C was the old fashioned wall unit, and terribly noisy if you are trying to sleep. the towels could use an extra wash and bleach as well. CONVENIENCE - be warned there is NO atm machine...I had to run next door to the Holiday Inn. check in and check out is quick since they have automated machines (like airport check in). they have a desk that sells park tickets but the woman in front of me was taking too long. there is no information book in the room so i had to call the front desk every time i had a question. the one great thing was the free wi-fi in the room. The elevators were so slow. AMENITIES - The fitness center should be re-labeled as two treadmills in a closet. They have a printer so you can print boarding passes.

Another member of staff took over and found it immediately. For the rest of our stay all staff were exceptionally nice. There is a refrigerator in the room which was great. The pool was quite small but was always empty so it was lovely to relax. The is no pool bar but nobody had a problem with us taking our own drinks down to the pool (which saved us a lot of money). There is a TGI Friday's next door and a place called Miller's ale house a 5 minute walk away which is amazing - excellent food and drink deals! There is also a Cracker Barrel restaurant 2 minutes away which served nice food but did not serve alcohol. The only slight disappointment was that there is no safe in the room. The reception staff will provide you with a free safety deposit box in the office which you can access at any time but it was just not as convenient as having it in your room. The air conditioning in our room seemed quite noisy in comparison with other hotels which sometimes kept us awake but it was certainly better than having a very hot room.There was complimentary breakfast which we didn't take full advantage of, but it was fabulous to have a free coffee every morning! There is an I-ride stop close by which is great, however it was only for the green line which will take you to wet n wild and sea world but does not go down International drive so you have to change lines which can be inconvenient.

Overall we had an excellent holiday and as my only slight disappointment was that there was no safe in the room I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone doing a universal holiday.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cornwall", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but...\u201d", "Author": "wagtail685", "ReviewID": "UR105741571", "Content": "Stayed here for 2 weeks during our family vacation to the Disney and Universal parks. The hotel is in a great spot to walk (15 mins) to Universal and in a quiet area albeit near to a major junction. The iTrolley stop is 2 minutes walk which was a bonus and it has a Cracker Barrel next door with a 7-11 across the road which was very convenient. The hotel staff were always helpful and courteous, the room was a good size (twin double beds with a pull out sofa bed) and everything worked. Air con, water, TV (huge) etc etc. The TV was great as it has connections for all popular portable devices so if you have an iPad with a tv conenction cable, bring it loaded with kids programmes and films and they'll love you for it! There's a gym room with a few bits of kit, but not a fully kitted out gym by any sretch of the imagination, a pool outside which I have to say was a bit cold. Even in 35c outside temp I was shivering in the water, so maybe look into that Hyatt? But the kids loved it. We spent most of the time out at the parks or eating in the multitude of bars and grill available locally. TGIs next door is also a bonus, but..... This hotel is not prepared for its own popularity. Both in terms of the amount of people staying and needing food in the morning and its catering for international guests. Breakfast is served in the reception area and consists of bagels, English muffins (word to the wise Hyatt, please just call them muffins because they certainly aren't english) fresh fruit, biscuits and gravy (for us english guests, scones and a flour based chopped sausage sauce) and cereals. You can order hot food from the terminal but at extra cost. You do get fed up to the back teeth with a carb loaded breakfast each day but the real issue is the fact there is nowhere to sit. I would estimate there is space for 20 or so people at the tables in reception. We ended up eating in the conference room across the hall which really isn't ideal, then towards the end of our holiday started collecting our food and taking it back to our rooms. We were forced on two occasions to eat in the hotel in the evening (young kids and a late return from a park) and if you thought American portions were large then this will certainly dispel that myth. I would describe them as kids portions and that still might leave my 7 year old hungry to be honest. I appreciate this isn't a restaurant and not set up to produce large quantities but for the price we expect a bit more.

Some thoughts on this hotel: I am a Gold Passport member that redeemed points for this stay and the hotel did not honor my request (as stated in the original reservation, i.e., not a last-minute request) for a higher floor room so that was a bit disconcerting, but no big deal. It is a small property with 3-4 floors so I can't comment on the elevator speed that others have complained about as I did not use them (yes, they put me in a first floor room by the pool, but luckily I checked in late and the pool was closing around then so there wasn't much noise to contend with.) I liked the self-serve snack bar and the 24-hour Starbucks and actually took advantage of it for a late-night snack. Prices were reasonable and it was nice to be able to grab something without having to get in the car and find a convenience store or paying through the nose for room service. Breakfast was fine but awkward. There were juices, fruit, \"fake\" bagels, English muffins, packaged cereals and made-to-order options (the latter at a surcharge). The bagels seemed to be mass-produced, thawed frozen ones, but they were passable for a \"free\" breakfast. The flow in the breakfast room is poor as it is a small room so there was a lot of bumping into people who were backtracking to grab other items. In fact, there is no flow at all. I am guessing that the property this was before it became a Hyatt did not have a breakfast area so Hyatt did the best they could with the space that was there but it definitely is awkward and incredibly small. Also, I found it a bit odd that they put wet -- albeit clean -- glasses top down on a wood shelf without any placemat or the like underneath. Who knows how clean the wood shelf is and I thought this was a little strange. Take note if you are a germaphobe. As to the hotel room itself, it more or less is what you see in the website photo although it is not very large. As long as it is clean, I am happy though and I found no issues with the bed linens although one of the bath towels had a dark stain which I didn't notice until after I used it (gross). Hopefully it was clean. I stayed at another property nearby a year or so earlier and the floor and in-room sofa was so sticky I couldn't/wouldn't take my shoes off while walking around the room, so the Hyatt was a marked improvement. There was an in-room safe although I didn't use it. There was a firdge (no freezer shelf though) which was nice although it was in the \"off\" position when I got there so I had to wait a bit for it to cool down the water I was planning to store there overnight. The hotel was booked that night and I feared a first-floor room would be noisy with the pool nearby and being near the lobby but the extra loud A/C unit helped to deflect any noise... I imagine it is a vestige of whatever the property was prior to being a Hyatt but it was loud and not thermostat controlled. One of those, hi/lo fan hot/cold numbers. Not a deal breaker, but unless you like that kind of constant loud din to block out other noise and lull you to sleep, that was the biggest detratcion from an otherwise nice room. Service was great, very friendly and outgoing. They also gave a 15% card for restaurants at CityWalk upon check in -- which I did not use, but is worth mentioning to other travelers. I don't know what they charge for rooms as I did not pay, but if it is over $100, then I would suggest shopping around becuase it is not a full-service hotel and there are a ton of other options in the immediate area. Also, this as is not a full-service, resort hotel I wouldn't stay here for long trips as it is not that comfortable a property. Even if you just use it as a place to sleep, your average traveller would like to have some additional creature comforts, which this hotel does not have. So, for one or two nights with non-fussy travelers, I say this place is worth consideration. To put this hotel in perspective, even the person at reception when I checked in \"warred\" me that this is the \"basic level\" of Hyatt so I shouldn't expect anything similar to what you get at a Hyatt Regency.

It's also really close to the park and they offer free daily shuttles to universal. The reason I am giving this hotel terrible reviews is because of an incident that occured two nights ago. We were in town to celebrate my fiance's birthday, when on the evening of birthday he was stopped by two police officers in the elevator and escorted out of the hotel. Once outside he was made to kneel/sit on the curb while the police officers interrogated him. People stopped to stare. You see, the hotel seems to have a problem with local restaurants sending out their employees to slide fliers beneath the doors of hotel patrons. This of course is trespassing, so the hotel wants it to stop. When the hotel staff catches wind of this they simply call the police. On march 12th someone on staff reported that my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 fit the description of one of these restaurant employees so he was apprehended and made to kneel on the ground like a common criminal in front of the hotel doors. While I understand the hotels position, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that there is too much traffic in this hotel for someone to really be apprehended based on \"fitting the description.\" these criminals will need to be caught red handed or via video surveillance, not. Otherwise there will be more instances of mistaken identity, and frankly it's unacceptable to have hotel patrons abused in this manner. The issue with the trespassers is the hotels problem, not the patrons. The hotel did comp us 75% for the night this happened, but it doesn't take away the sting of being treated like a common criminal. The cops even refused to allow my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 to show them his hotel room key. After about 30 or so minutes of being held on the curb the cops let him go after someone on staff cleared his ID. Meanwhile no one called to apologize. The next day I spoke to the manager on duty and she assured me that someone named Yolanda would call me the next morning at 6am. She also said Yolanda tried to call our room but we weren't present. Why she didn't call the cell phone number on file is beyond me. Also, the next morning the only call I recieved was from a hotel clerk telling us a cab was waiting to take us to the airport. How the Sunday manager confused needing to speak with yolanda at 6am with get us a taxi at 6am is beyond me. We left for the airport at 6:30 and Yolanda had not arrived for her shift. All in all were were traumatized by the experience and won't ever visit this hotel again if they continue to combat their issue with trespassers at the expense of their guests. Had my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 not been so outwardly calm, he could have been arrested.

Trust me, its such a easy nice walk, I could have done it blindfolded!!To spend $15 dollars for parking to drive there is crazy if you have legs use them..It took us exactly 14 minutes to arrive at Universal City Walk area via Major Blvd and then left up Universal Blvd to the entrance along a beautiful pathway.(The sidewalk is located on the right side of Major Blvd only) The Hyatt Place is kinda nice, and kinda not nice in other respects.The staff are the best part of the hotels experience.Our room which was the one I requested, end unit high floor was located next to the stairwell (and noisy ice machine) and I am really happy it was because like others on here posted,the elevators are awful they were not replaced or updated when Hyatt bought this building.They have the appearance inside of being old and neglected just worn out. We used that aforementioned stairwell next to our room for coming and going and it was clean and bright and much better than using the brutally slow elevators. Our room had a kinda gritty feel to the couch like it wasn't vacuumed good (or at all) and the bathroom is so small you have to go outside of it if you want to change your mind.That dosen't bother us much because you are only in there to (well you know) but it was also not really clean with dirt in the corners and a few floor tiles were broken and one even lifted if you stepped on the corner of it. It was warm 73f and the AC kept it nice but I suspect when its 90f in the summer the room may be hot because it dosen't have much gumption and seems weak. We used the pool after our long walk and it is salt water but again the area around there is not really clean.The loungers are dirty and the bottom of the pool looks like it needs scrubbing..The water looked good and we enjoyed its size and 6 ft depth all to ourselves.

There are a couple of hotels clustered right around this area, so I can't say that it's impossible to find a better location, but if you plan to spend time at Universal this hotel is really convenient. Other than the location, I found the hotel disappointing. In part this may have been because I have had much better experiences with this chain in the past. I'm not sure when this hotel was built, but the maintenance of it is lacking. The reception area is well kept, but other public areas like the elevators were so beaten up they reminded me of the dumpy apartment buildings I used to live in during college.

The photos show a room divided by an artsy, shade-style wall, but that is not what the rooms at this property are actually like.

The room cleanliness was also a little disappointing, as my dresser drawer contained a couple of empty beer bottles and caps. On the plus side, the room is relatively spacious thanks to the separate sitting area (though the bathrooms are as small as they can possibly be), and the television is huge. The other amenities are kind of a mixed bag. The \"fitness center\" was disappointing. A more apt name for it would be \"a couple of treadmills arranged in a closet\".

While the hotel and staff were great, my major complaint was the bathroom in our room. You literally could not flush any toilet paper bigger than a one square one ply piece of toilet paper down, then you had to flush at least 3 times before anything would happen. Anything bigger than the one square would cause the toilet to become backed up. We notified the front desk, but I don't think they actually came up to fix it seeing how it continued to not flush and get backed up. The only other complaint was the beds, since we checked in so late we ended up with a standard 2 double bed room, but the pillowtop mattresses were so uncomfortable that my husband ended up having to sleep in one bed and me in the other--not that big of a deal, except it was our honeymoon and it would've been nice to share a bed. Neither of us got a good night's sleep because of the beds. Other minor inconveniences: the elevator took forever to work, the inputs on the tv where you can hook up your laptop wouldn't work (not a huge deal since we were there for only 1 night and had spent the majority of the day enjoying Universal), they had the other eatting area closed off so it was every man for himself when trying to find a place to sit, and apparently the lady before my husband took all of the toast (some 4 or 5 pieces) right when he was going to grab a slice (not the hotel's fault, just a rude lady).

The parking lot is well lit and appeared secure. You needed a room key to enter the building through any of the side doors. One night we had very heavy rain and the access road to the hotel flooded due to a clogged drain and we didn't think we could get out.

Disney costs $14 per person on the shuttle, and the whole trip takes about an hour. Add another hour if you're taking Mears to this location from the airport, since it's really out of the way apparently. HDTVs with HBO is a nice bonus, as is the design of the room and mini-fridge.

The value for what you pay is outstanding. We were a party of 5 with 2 children and booked a 2 bed room. Usually, this means that I will be spending the night on an air mattress on the side of one of the beds. However, the included couch was more than adequate to sleep on. In fact, both of my children wanted to give up their bed our last 2 nights so that they could use it. It was large and comfortable. The room itself is enormous. We had more than enough space to maneuver and spread out. My only real complaint was that the mini fridge was temperamental. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do a great job at keeping anything cool. We had water bottles stuffed in there the moment we arrived and they were only slightly colder by the time we checked out 3 days later. If I was nitpicking, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to see the bathrooms be bigger as well. They run a little on the small side. If I was 6\u00e2\u20ac\u21224\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, I may have felt cramped. Plenty of closet space and drawers for our needs. Also two vanity sinks so that the kids won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fight while brushing their teeth. After a long plane ride, and days at theme parks in the heat, this became an amenity itself. The continental breakfast was decent. Several cereals, pastries, biscuits, gravy and juices to choose from. I would have liked a meat product of some sort included, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a huge deal. They do allow you to order a hot breakfast but the prices weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very competitive. (I think $6 for eggs and bacon) It can get crowded after 8:00 AM but I never saw anyone denied seating in the designated areas. The location was excellent. There is a CVS, Walmart and several gas stations within a few miles. TGI Fridays is about 100 yards from the front of the hotel. If you walk down the street to the intersection, you are at the gate for Universal Studios. I have to disagree with some here on the walk time. I consider myself somewhat athletic and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that you could get to the ticket booth in less than 20-30 minutes in the heat with children. (Not the City Walk, the actual gate where you provide your tickets) The hotel has complimentary shuttles that will bring you to and from at stated times. (Get there early if you want to be on the first group) The last pickup time for return was 7:30 PM. A cab from door to door was only $6.00 plus tip with the price including up to 5 people per car. So, if you want to stay earlier or later than what the shuttle allows, this is a cheap (air-conditioned) option for you to utilize\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6especially with tired feet. The staff was outstanding and very accommodating. During breakfast they would ask you how everything was and would go out of their way to make you feel welcomed. If you join the Hyatt Gold Passport program, which is free to do online, they will give you a coupon for 1 free drink per night spent. (Including alcohol) It was nice to leave theme parks where we were paying an arm and a leg to eat and come back to the hotel for a free cold beer when the kids went to sleep. You will also receive complimentary wireless internet. My only complaints about the hotel are minor. First, the pool. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a bad pool, and certainly not the feature of any trip to Orlando, but it is very small for its location near a major attraction for kids. I know that Hyatt Place is a cookie cutter model, but it would have been nice if they would have expanded the existing pool or added a second to accommodate families during the busy season. The second, and perhaps the biggest thorn in my side, is the elevator. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if they are possessed or what, but usually taking the stairs is your fastest option. It takes several minutes for the elevator to arrive at your floor on a 6 floor hotel. (And there are 2 elevators) Even if you are the only person in the car, and it will sometimes stop at every floor on the way down. I did notice that it is up for re-inspection in August 2010, so hopefully they will correct this. Overall, I was very happy with my stay and would have no problems recommending the hotel to friends and family. I can see the allure of staying on a Disney/Universal property, but I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t justify the prices that come with it when a hotel such as this does such a fantastic job at a fraction of the price.

It took about 15-20 minutes to walk from the hotel to the front gate itself at a brisk pace. At the end of the day it is very tiresome. Though there was a shuttle from the hotel, we wanted to get the park earlier than it left so we walked each day. Overall the hotel is like the pictures advertised on the hotel website and is a clean hotel with a modern look to it. The only negative would be the elevator. Compared to the rest of the hotel, the elevator is very dated, worn, and slow. The breakfast was ok, with lots of fruit and cereal choices, but nothing hot. You can pay to order a hot breakfast like an omelet, but I never opted for that. The hotel is quiet off the main road. Bathroom where toilet and shower is really tiny and it is awkward to get in and shut the door with the limited space. Sink is outside the bathroom and the closet is fairly small. There's not really a convenient place to keep your luggage out of the way and I typically don't unpack everything into drawers and like to keep my suitcase out. I finally put it in the corner next to my bed and the outside wall. There is a nice sitting area in the room where another person could sleep if necessary. There is a refrigerator in each room but no microwave. You can, however, use dishes and the microwave in the kitchen/breakfast area of the hotel at any time.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location and Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Mac514", "ReviewID": "UR67052498", "Content": "After reading several reviews on this hotel before we arrived I was slighty worried.

The hotel was easy to find coming straight from the Airport. Check-In was no problem and we were put into a Handicapped accessible room on the second floor. The room had a touch more space to move about that a normal room with a large and comfortable King Bed. There was an out of sight closet area with a Iron and Iron board. There was a separate sink area that had a empty fridge underneath which we took full advantage of. The sink area was in the main room as opposed to the bathroom but for just a couple this did not represent much of an issue. There was also a hairdryer in the room. The seating area and the HD TV were good to have if travel companions were sleeping but the TV could easily wake other sleeping as the TV did not have much pivot angle on it. Breakfast was fine and had a selection of single serve cereals along with Yoghurts and Fresh Fruit. There was also donuts, bread, bagels and English Muffins along with Cream Cheese and Preserves. Juices, Water and Coffee were also available. If wished you can order a freshly prepared Eggs and Waffles from a select menu. Availability ends slightly later on the weekend. The free wi-fi was also great and available throughout the hotel, you just need to enter your name into a pop-up for 48 hours access. The fitness centre is small with just 2 treadmills, one bike and one cross-trainer and I preferred to take advantage of the weather and train outside but is was hot even going out around 7.30am As previously mentioned the Hotel is very accesible for Universal Studios and would take 15 minutes to walk there. Once over Kirkman Rd the walk is very pleasant through the Universal resort with well maintained pathways etc. I took advantage of this and used it as part of a morning run route. It also felt fine to walk out on an evening to the restaurants/ citywalk area. TGI Fridays is seperated from the hotel by 1 further hotel and is great for families or just grabbing a drink at the bar. We also ate at Millers Ale House along Kirkman road and enjoy the big screens with various sports and the reasonably priced food and drinks offers. The pool was fine for cooling off in but not big enough to exercise. Towels are available outside by the pool. The only negative would be the size as if a number of guests tried to use it, it would get full very quickly but mostly people are at the parks and this will restrict use. The Interstate noise was noticible from the pool area but this will be no worse than at any other hotels in the Orlando area. The hotel is also well placed for the Prime Outlets, Mall at Millenia and the Florida Mall should you wish to hit the shops. Disney as well as the premium outlets are probably about 20 minutes away down the interstate and if Disney was the main part of your visit then I would suggest staying slightly closer to Lake Buena Vista etc. For us who were not doing the parks it was a great choice and we would stay again.", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo, SP", "Title": "\u201cgood hotel near Universal Studios\u201d", "Author": "Ferrazalves", "ReviewID": "UR65217629", "Content": "We stayed at the Hyatt Universal this time.

I managed to get a really good deal through Priceline but I have already booked up directly with Hyatt for October this year. My partner and I were travelling around the USA and during our stop in Orlando it was essential we had somewhere to rest easy and not cost us a lot of money to get around places. Now, first off I will say that if you plan to go to Disney, this hotel is quite a distance from it. We had to get a shuttle which was arranged for us by Hyatt at the cost of $2.50 each way each day. Happily though, the Hyatt Universal is the first pick-up so you get a choice of seats on the bus and you get to Disney within 30 minutes. Universal however is literately across the road. A Lot of people on here have said that you need the shuttle or it is a 25 minute walk but this is simply not true. Even with children this walk will take you 15 minutes at the very most and as Universal is almost instantly within your sights upon leaving the hotel, it gets close very quick. Yes you have to cross a busy highway but there are lights which enable you to cross so I don't get the problem. Upon crossing the road we walked through the car park and within minutes you are in City walk. Very convenient, very quick and unless you suffer from a serious lack of motivation or are just plain lazy, this walk is a breeze. Now back to the hotel. We didn't use it that much but when we did we found a lot of home comfort in having a large HD TV in the room and it was nice to wake up to in the morning and watch ESPN HD. The fridge was incredibly handy and so was the air conditioning unit. I suffer from tinnitus and it is essential I have a gentle humming sound during the night to enable me to sleep, this did the job fantastic. I didn't use the pool but my partner did and she loved it. Yes it was small but there was no-one using it and was nicely lit at night. Within 2-3 mins of the hotel next to the Holiday Inn is a TGI Fridays which we used for our first night at the Hyatt but I would suggest Jimmy Buffett's in City Walk. Staff were excellent, the business centre enabled us to print out directions to our next destination and was always available. Breakfast was a little bland but on the plus side is, it was free and if we wanted something a little bit more substantial, we could order it from the kitchen. I did this once and although a little expensive, it was nice to have some eggs!

The toilet was way too close to the shower there was just no space to move in there. The room service was not up to scratch the room did not get hoovered once whilst we stayed there if you walked on the carpet your feet will end up black within minutes, i ended up walking around with my flip flops on.

The hotel however do offer a free shuttle service to take you to universal. Also do not stay at this hotel if you are not driving, we was not driving and there was not many places to walk to as the hotel is right next to the motorway which you cannot cross and there are hardly any pavements to walk on. unless you don't mind taking a taxi everywhere, the hotel staff will call one for you. There is free continental breakfast in the mornings which was nice with a wide range of things to choose from and you can also take it up to your room, only downfall is some of the plates and cutlery was dirty, not very nice to put your breakfast on.

So I went via numerous toll roads to the Hyatt Place. My expectations for any hotel that touts its location as being ACROSS THE STREET FROM UNIVERSAL STUDIOS were low, + I'm a Hilton guy, so I'd never tried Hyatt Place, the lower-end part of the chain. The exterior is plain, not a surprise once you realize that many Hyatt Place properties were once lowly AmeriSuites. But after an efficient check-in in the pleasant lobby and a s-l-o-w elevator ride, I was quite impressed by the suite-style room. The decor is modern, wtih a good desk, wet bar with fridge (which I think is great for keeping water cold), an enormous flat panel tv, adequate bathroom, and nice bed. The tv is situated so it can swivel toward the living room or the bedroom. I very rarely bother with hotel pools, but it was a gorgeous Sunday and I had nothing more pressing than preparing for an interview (!), so I laid out for about 1.5 hours. The pool was small but adequate, with plenty of towels. The view of the parking lot and expressway leaves a bit to be desired, and there were a lot of loud kids, but both dilemmas were resolved with, respectively, closed eyes and an iPod. The in-hotel gym is pretty weak, but as a biz traveler, my expectations for hotel gyms are very low. The area around the hotel is horrid, but then again, it caters to touristas visiting Universal. There's a TGI Fridays very close by, which isn't my game, but it was adequate. There's a Starbucks about 1/2 a mile away. All in all, I liked the hotel.

The sole purpose of our trip was to visit Universal Studios and City Walk. I have nothing bad to say about the hotel just a few tips to offer. If you are looking for a hotel with entertainment or a bar/lounge you may need to upgrade. By no means did I have any complaints concerning this hotel it was just a very basic no thrills hotel. As you enter the hotel there is a lobby area where you register, encompassed in this area is a snack area that offers sandwiches/fruit/water/soda - keep in mind anything you purchase in a hotel will be expensive; a bottled water and soda was I believe was $2.75 not horrible, we ordered cold sandwiches twice late night, again not bad, nice to have this option. There is also a kiosk where you can order food 24 hours. There is one shuttle option in the morning leaving for Universal studios at 8:40am and one in the evening at 6:40pm these are the only times the shuttle leaves and this pick up is at the end of the route so plan on standing the 10 minutes or so that it takes to get to the park. They advertise this park is across the street; this is not necessarily true, yes you can walk but expect at least a 20 minute walk, it really is further than right across the street, and after walking all day it's nice to just relax and get a cab back to your room. Cab rides are about $6.00 one way ; the one thing that I learned is on the way home from the park the cab drivers are not thrilled about taking you the short distance - I guess they loose their place in line for only a $6.00 fair and most of the cabbies lease their vehicles so you will not receive a warm welcome by any means - I almost hated asking but late at night or after a long day I just wanted to be driven back to the hotel. There are a few shuttle return pick up times (I believe 3) during the day but again long lines and you have to adhere to the schedule which we never did. If you miss the free shuttle in the morning the hotel will call you a cab that they contract with, again price is $6.00 that was nice if you wanted to sleep in. We had fresh towels every day, the staff was welcoming, friendly always welcomed us back from our day - no complaints but once you get back to your hotel there really is not too much to do. THere is a counter area where you can order a beer or wine but there is no \"bar\" or entertainment in the hotel. THere is a TGIF's within walking distance and also a Cracker Barrel Restaraunt besides that there are no close food options unless you take a cab. I personally would opt to spend the additional money and stay on Universal site next time or upgrade to a hotel with more options, unfortuantely with the little options the hotel offers there is not much around the hotel to compensate. We are a 40 year old couple who like to stay up late but also prefer to be close to the homefront so for us this was just your basic come back to the room and sleep. The rooms were nice equipped with a fridgerator, sitting area and a large screen TV, beds were comfortable, dressing/makeup vanity outside of the bathroom - bathroom consisted of a shower/tub combo and toilet. If you are looking for a hotel close by and are on a budget this is definetely a good deal - I would not deter anyone from staying here. There was also a nice complimentary continental breakfast. fruit, juices, bagels in the morning. Do not use a credit card if you order pizza from an outside source at night - pay cash upon delivery - we ordered pizza from a restaurant and it never came and when we tried calling back there was no answer, now this was on a Sunday night and they may have decided to close early but not even a phone call saying they would not be able to make our order - luckily we did not use a credit card.

I was offered no discount for taking a room that I did not reserve. 4) My boyfriend asked about the free shuttle to Universal and we were told that the service was provided by Universal and cost $7 per person for a round trip.

This review is a little late, but I can't stop thinking about how great this hotel was for what I paid. And because I got such a great deal on this hotel, I feel like it's only right to thank the hotel by recommending the Hyatt to everyone who might come across this. Thanks to Priceline I got an incredible deal for $30 a night, and boy was it worth it! For 6 nights, the total came to be $212 dollars. Just to reiterate the value in the hotel, that's less than what we paid for 1 day at Disney w/ park hopper for the two of us! ($250) As for the location it could only have been better if we would have actually stayed at one of Universal's three hotels. From the Hyatt we were able to walk to Universal three different times during our trip and figured we had saved at least an additional $30 dollars by not driving across the street and paying the parking fee. Some individuals have complained about the walk being long and dangerous, and have warned others on walking across the street to not do it. I would like to point out that I do not agree. There is a big intersection that needs to be crossed in front of the hotel, but there is a cross walk and a light where you can easily cross at. From there you follow the sidewalk to Universal and are there before you know it. I actually found it an enjoyable way to start our day as we got to see Universal's hotels and many small lizards on our way. We were also not alone on the walk. Many other individuals who were staying at nearby hotels were also walking near us. My travel partner and I are both in our twenties, maybe if we had kids I would think differently, but in my opinion don't be scared, it's really not a bad walk at all! I never once feared for my safety, and for us that was part of the reason of choosing this hotel was the convenience of being able to walk to the theme parks! Back to why I feel like I got such a great deal at the Hyatt, I believe the Doubletree across the street charges a resort fee, parking fee, and internet fee as do many hotels in the Orlando area. The Hyatt did not. I was able to access the internet in our room, purchase theme park tickets, and print them downstairs. Which allowed me to save both time and money. As for the actual hotel, I believe if you plan to spend all your time outside of your room at the theme parks then this hotel is perfect. If you are looking to hang out at the hotel then I would probably suggest something a little more upscale. As for the room, it's decent size, has a refrigerator which is always a plus, nice big flat screen TV, which is also a plus, and big sofa. The hotel room itself is good. As for the rest of the hotel, I would not say this is the most beautiful hotel that I ever stayed it, because it is not. The elevators are slow and annoying so we usually would end up taking the stairs, but I look at that as getting some exercise. The lobby and the food area are not that big. For my taste the hotel is a little small, only 6 or 7 floors, but still for the price I paid I really can not complain. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to save money and spend time at Universal Studios. I am planning a trip in October and hoping that I can stay at this hotel again for the rate that I paid in May. Again for a good rate you will be amazed at how much you can get for so little.", "Date": "August 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "charlotte, nc", "Title": "\u201cGreat free breakfast, super nice staff, huge TV in room for ESPN highlights at night!\u201d", "Author": "singergal", "ReviewID": "UR38370369", "Content": "Stayed here for our family vacation to Universal -Seaworld-WetnWild-BuschGardens!

We had 3 busloads of kids staying during the week we were there for a convention and even with all of those people, we were able to get breakfast just fine because the hotel staff (smiling of course) opened up additional rooms for the kids to hang out in for breakfast so that other families could sit at the regular tables.

The lady at the front desk helped by calling,and then told me \"We tell the guest not to oder from those places\" but that headache could have been spared,if we we're told that in advance!Rather than them rushing to charge the incidental fee to our credit card for the entire length of our \"PRE PAID\" stay upon check in!Which is an inconvience when it is assumed the guest didn't choose that location to stay in their rooms but instead out at the parks.The charge hasen't been credited back to my card yet and the only thing we did was order a movie one rainy night. My overall opinion is that the Hotel is just a stones Throw to Universal Studios,the shuttles are very convient,but if we ever go back to Orlando we would choose to stay at the other Hyatt Place location only because there is more to do around that location such as mini golf,and more resturants for those days we didn't want to go to the parks.", "Date": "August 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Front Desk!

The bathroom set up was awful. The only light is above the toilet so showering is tough and you have to wait for your eyes to adjust. 3.

Although this isn't an excellent hotel, I felt we made a good choice. Pros: -LOCATION! I have to say that this is the best part of the hotel. My dad decided not to go the parks, and in order to save money he just dropped us off everyday. It never took more than 5 minutes to get from the hotel to the parks [even waiting through the long light at Kirkman Rd.)! I recommend using the guest drop-off if not everyone in your party is going to the parks. - The rooms are spacious. We all had plenty of space for our bags, etc. and they were never in the way. -The extra \"lounge area\" in the room was really nice for privacy. It was just a screen, but it was enough to separate the area from where the beds were. -The television was great! It was pretty big, and it was nice that we were able to make it pivot so everyone could watch. Also, there were many outlets for you to use (for example, someone could hook up their DVD player). -We arrived to the hotel early and I wasn't sure they would allow us to check-in, but it was no problem! Cons: -The bathroom door is so wide that it's a little tricky entering the bathroom. When you open/close it, it almost gets stuck because it comes so close to the toilet. -Our sink was a little plugged. I haven't read any recent reviews to see if other guests have had the same experience, but it was a little annoying. -It's been mentioned here before, but we had an advertisement for a pizza place under our door when we returned to our room one day. Later in the day, we received a letter from the Hyatt staff telling us to ignore the ad because the Hyatt isn't affiliated with the company. -The pool was drained. We were disappointed because we assumed that, especially during spring break, the pool would be open. Overall, I would recommend the Hyatt Place to anyone visiting Universal Orlando.

I know there are people writing reviews on here whom think this place is great because they are use to staying in Motel 6 and Days Inn, and this is a step up. Don't believe the ratings. I cannot tell you what a disappointment this hotel is. I think Hyatt Place, having stayed at others previously, is a great chain. This hotel must suffer from poor management. If you enjoy being treated like dirt by staff; then by all means stay here. I am one of the easiest people to please; I require little or no attention and will go about my way happily. However, it seems this staff went out of its way to be disrespectful. Here are a few of the highlights: --Dirty dishes caked with moldy food found under couch from prior guest, when I went looking for my son's matchbox cars. --The hallway was filled with pot-smoke as I could hear someone ripping hits on a bong. --The staff unwillingly let us have a 2 hour late check out so as to meet our car-service. The front desk clerk talked down to me \"we'll let you stay a couple hours late THIS TIME.....but, first let me check with the housecleaner Maria to see if it interferes with her schedule\". (granted I just spent $300+ dollars for a two night stay). --At check in I was basically scared away from any incidentials when the manager made it seem as if buying any would be the most stressful situation in the world. --The guest elevators double as freight elevators so prepare to wait for staff to use them first, guests must wait, staff does not offer you the elevator or make way. --I paid $17.50 for a very small sandwich, two sodas and a vendor size bag of M and M's! at the snack bar.

We had 3 requests: high floor (7 floors available), facing Universal and away from the elevator. We were on the 6th floor and facing Universal (caught small amount of fireworks the one night we were in room at the right time), but we were in closest room to elevator without being next to elevator (across the hallway). I did ask about the room location at checkin and they assured me it wasn't next to elevator but across and down the hall...\"down the hall\" turned out to mean the first door across and 6 steps to the left from the elevator. I should have gone right back down to switch, but I didn't (after traveling all day, I was feeling tired). Anyway, we did get noise (talking/laughing/yelling) from other guests sometimes very late at night and very early in am. They must not have realized those were occupied hotel rooms all around the elevator area! There was also a set of double doors that \"separated\" elevator waiting area from hall...these were directly outside out doors and cut down on the verbal noise but added clanging door noise when anyone used them. I preferred the verbal noise, so I tried to keep those doors open (and I had a white noise machine...don't leave home without it!). Any noise we did get to our room was short lived and bearable. As another reviewer mentioned, the park does not recognize our Hyatt Place key cards as discounts...one waiter told us we needed to have a card \"sleeve\" that stated we were at a preferred hotel, not the actual key card. He ended up giving us the discount anyway so we tipped him a bit extra! This was not a big deal to us, in the long run. The complimentary shuttle only works for you if you don't mind going (3 morning x's offered 8:40 10:40 and 11:30 during our stay...along with 1 trip at 6:40 pm for City Walk) or returning ( 2 x's offered 7 and 9:15 pm plus 2 or 3 late night returns for City Walk; midnight and 2am and ??). The schedule is not too convenient but we did use it for 3 trips there and one back, other wise we took a cab back (~6 bucks including tip) and on 2 days we drove and paid 12 for parking, as we knew we would be back and forth a couple times (save first receipt and you have in and out privileges for the day). Yes, bathroom and toilet door are tight and sink/vanity area was nice but if one person is drying hair it is annoying to another that is trying to watch TV! :) More drawer space would also be nice if you have more than one person as there are only 3 medium size drawers...closet space was adequate. After first day our wash clothes weren't replenished, after 2nd day of this (we specifically left note requesting a two) we had NO washcloth left. By 3rd day, washcloth supply was fine! The bathtup was a bit...old? Possibly the one thing not updated when Hyatt took over this property 2 years ago. Otherwise, hotel room was very clean, beds were comfortable and we enjoyed the sitting area with small sofa The breakfast was plenty: fresh fruit, bagels, cereal fits the way we eat on mornings we are trying to get somewhere. We did order food one night to supplement our restaurant leftovers. Picky 11YO enjoyed the pizza and the salad was made fresh for us. Not really a \"restaurant\" but definitely helpful. Received 2 complimentary drink coupons at checkin which were used for wine available at wine/coffe bar...nice touch! We (my sister, too!) used business center for Southwest airlines checkin...no complaints and very convenient. Did not make use of in room internet as I used Blackberry for any minor internet/email needs I had. My sister and her 11 year old stayed at the nearby huge Doubletree at same time and she found their hotel to be a bit inconvenient and more costly. A lot of school groups were there (a lot of kids running around), pool area was always crowded (she came to our small, quiet pool that had more than enough lounge chairs for the few of us using it one afternoon), cost $10 /day for internet, they charged her for parking (didn't even have a car with her...I could park my car at Hyatt Place for free) and they couldn't honor her request for a room facing Universal. The staff at Hyatt Place Universal was helpful and pleasant (don't know what was going on with housekeeping and the washclothes) and anytime I had a question or complaint (billed too much for in room movie) they took care of it. For the price I received, this hotel could not be beat! (I found it cheaper on website other than Hyatt's and they honored that price minus 20%...with tax, that was nearly $56 per night which is unbeatable! \"Best Price Guarantee\") Better than Hotwire! I prefer hotels with a door separating sleeping from living areas, but for our purposes, this hotel worked out very nicely.

We were going to use the check-in kiosk but a friendly staffer (a young lady) came and greeted us and offered to help us at the desk. Another staffer held the elevator for me when I was getting luggage upstairs, and the young men at the desk spoke to us every single time we passed. To top it off, the manager, TIM, is one of the nicest, most professional people on the planet. Against the tourism channel's advice, we ordered pizza from a flyer under our door. Over an hour later, when we had trouble getting the pizza and the business was extremely rude, Tim actually talked to them and informed them that they were not welcome on the premises and not authorized to pass out the room flyers. He stepped in and helped us deal with the uncomforatable situation THEN offered to cook us pizzas himself, brought them up to the room, and didn't even charge us. He really saved a bad situation. As for the room, the whole reason we ordered pizza was because we wanted to stay in and enjoy the super nice sitting area, colossal TV, and order a movie off PPV. What a treat after a week-long conference!!! Having the sink area and separate bed area was so nice. We were even able to comfortably invite up a business colleague to join us since we had a sitting area. Oh, and we loved the little bistro that was available 24-7 downstairs--how nice. I LOVE this hotel, and I've stayed in the nicest, most expensive hotels in the country with my travels.

However, they do have more then one departure schedule from the hotel and Universal studios. The only other awkward moment was breakfast time, the complimentary breakfast was not all that great!

The 42\" HDTV was a nice relaxing touch after a long day at the park in the sun. The A/C was great. The room was clean, the bathroom was clean, and the beds were sooo comfortable that my wife, 3 boys and I slept right through continental breakfast! (one of the reasons I picked this hotel) Cracker Barrel is right next door so breakfast actually turned out great anyway! The fold out sofa bed was great. My family of 5 was quite comfortable. The check-in can be done at 2 touch-screen kiosks just inside the front door with the credit card you used to reserve the room. Took 2-3 minutes. The refridgerator in the room was so cold that our bottled water had ice chunks in it the next morning. Talk about refreshing!! My only complaints are that check-in isn't until 3pm, and that makes it hard to get over to the park early and then you have to worry about getting back to the hotel to check-in and then get back to the park if you're staying until closing. The shuttle runs infrequently, don't depend on it for your transportation to the park and back. Another complaint is that the bathroom while clean is very very small. You have to balance on one foot over the toilet to close or open the bathroom door. Good pressure and tons of hot water though. The coffee maker was ridiculous, making one cup servings in glass mugs that I refused to use. You know the rule about using hotel glasses... If not, look it up. It's scary. Oh, and there were no plastic wrapped cups. So bring your own cups if possible. Overall I would definitely stay here again. My complaints may sound bad but they were small things.

The staff provides excellent customer service. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. Some rooms have more furniture than others. I had a double with too much furniture. I moved the extra furniture out of the way but the room was very cluttered. The bathroom is so small, you can't even close the door if you're not in there a certain way. By the way, none of us are overweight. Oh, the windows don't have screens. (Is that a FL thing?) I don't have young children but I didn't like that. The rooms have refrigerators but they DO NOT HAVE MICROWAVES. If you bought food, you have to bring it to the front desk and ask them to heat it up for you. Luckily, there are good restaurants and diners within walking distance because there is NO ROOM SERVICE and they only have EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE Starbucks-type food that you have to go to the front-desk area and order yourself. (I.e.: I saw a bagel sandwich on the menu that costs $8.00) There are no vending machines and I didn't see any ice machines. You always have to go to the front desk to get anything. We ordered in one night and the food was terrible. If you don't rent a car, don't stay here. You'll need to get food. The only coffee available at the Continental Breakfast is Starbucks. For us Starbucks-intolerant folk, we have to brew our own coffee in the room and bring it down to breakfast. Just so you know, the front desk is quick to tell you they are \"directly across the street from Universal Studios and City Walk\". Actually, they are directly across the street from the ENTRANCE. It's about a mile to the actual park and while it's scenic, it's not pedestrian friendly. There is a shuttle that runs to Universal/City Walk but if you miss it (because it doesn't run in the middle of the day) a cab ride only cost about $4.00. Also, there is a trolley at the end of the street that will take you to International Blvd. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Holiday Inn right next door and a Double Tree two doors down. Then, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a host of hotels and resorts on International Blvd. Even the Motel 6 on International is very nice and comparable to a Holiday Inn.

It was nasty I did not want to take a shower in there. Then we noticed that the AC Unit was leaking. the area of the floor around it was saturated. You could tab your feet and hear the water splashing. We immediately asked for a room change and was told that they were booked for the night. They also said that someone would come and fix the rooms. My friend and I leave and come back like 6 hours later. The floor still and not been cleaned, the tub remained the way it was, and there was a big noisy fan blowing in the room. The fan was just there to dry the floor, they never fixed what was causing the leak. We were forced to spend the night in a nasty room. The next day we got out early and was suspecting that when we returned everything would be cleaned and working in a good fashion. We were shocked to find that the floor was still saturated and the tub was nasty(we know this b/c we put a towel down to take a shower and the towel was still there), and the carpet was still not vacuum. We asked to speak with someone in charge and we asked to move out of that room immediately. By this time we both were sick. We changed rooms thinking everything was going to be good.

This hotel has so much potential in that it has modern decor, large TVs, spacious rooms and a business center with two computers and a printer, however with service and cleaning that is unsatisfactory, I think that business will eventually suffer horribly. Be sure to visit the Premium outlets if you enjoy shopping. Also, I dont know if it was an oversight on my part or not, but the hotel changes linens every 3 days (bed and towels) in an attempt to go green.

Would be nice to have a microwave. The bedroom portion of the room had 2 queen sized beds and a sink/vanity. The closet space is pretty small. A 42\" flat screen TV sits between the two rooms and swivels for viewing in either area. A decent selection of channels is offered. The bathroom is very small, but was clean. The hotel offers free WiFi, which at best was spotty with the connection being on and off. I'm not sure if housekeeping even exists in this hotel. To be the environmentally friendly guest, I did not mark the bed linens to be changed or the towels to be changed out. However, the only way I could even tell that housekeeping had been in the room was that the throw pillow was moved back onto the bed. In most hotels, even when not changing out the linens, the beds are made up. Glasses were not exchanged out and the trash was not collected. I usually stay with another chain, but had decided to give Hyatt a try since there was no availability within my usual haunts. I think I will stick with my usual chain from now on. Overall, it's not a bad place for just a place to sleep. The rates were lower than other hotels in the same area for the particular weekend. Just don't expect anything special.", "Date": "November 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cBudget a few more bucks and stay at a better hotel\u201d", "Author": "AtlantaStickler", "ReviewID": "UR10640795", "Content": "I must add this experience to the many disappointing ones related to the HYATT chain of hotels in recent years. In my book the HYATT chain of hotels is no longer synonymous with quality. This hotel will suffice if you're simply looking for a place to spend a couple of days. However, if you are someone like me who wants your hotel stay to be \"somewhat\" of a resort/spa experience while on vacation, then this may not be the hotel for you. The lobby area of the hotel doesn't sport a traditional front desk, and the space is very cramped. I guess this is part of the supposed \"updated\" decor, but it felt somewhat strange to me. I guess I'll start my critique noting that we were allowed to check-in an hour early. Also on a good note, having a 42\" plasma TV in each room is a definite plus, however that's probably where my good comments about the room will end. The decor in the living and bedroom areas have been updated, however they dropped the ball when it comes to the bathroom. I'm no architect, but it doesn't take one to recognize that the bathrooms were NOT part of the renovation, but are original to the previous AmeriSuites Hotel. In addition to being very small, the bottom of the bathtub sported strips of non-slip material that looked as though it hadn't been cleaned in years, as it was soooo dark and dingy. The tiles in the bathroom are definitely from a by-gone era. Talk about dropping the ball--WHY NOT GO ALL THE WAY WITH THE RENOVATIONS??? The HYATT spent no time updating the areas on, nor near the elevators either. It's pretty obvious that this was NOT A TOTAL RENOVATION, but simply an on-the-surface speedy makeover. Definitely NOT A QUALITY RENOVATION. To say that they provide a \"continental breakfast\" is somewhat deceiving. I've come to expect hotels to at least provide eggs (especially with at a cost of over $100 per night), or at the minimum danish as a part of the breakfast menu. Not so with this hotel. Make plans to pay extra or visit the Craker Barrel or Golden Corral (which are both in the vicinity ) if you'd like such items as eggs, bacon, and muffins for breakfast. Not to mention that due to the limited seating area you may not want to spend too much time eating breakfast anyway. They crammed as many tables as possible in the limited space near the front desk. One can hardly walk between the tables in order to be seated. As a matter of fact, the the front desk actually extends to become part of a breakfast bar, an area with stools where guests can sit and order Starbuck's coffee, or simply eat their breakfast. What a wierd design? Maybe their architect was one of the participants of \"Kid Nation\". I could have done a better job designing this hotel. On a final note, I didn't find the front desk staff to be very helpful. We asked that they recommend a good restaurant, and not once did they mention that Universal (which was right across the street) has an array of restaurants from which to choose. Instead they suggested \"dinner theatres\" located in other cities. Thank GOD that we brought along a guide book. I was looking for pamphlets reference things to do in the area, which can generally be found in every hotel lobby. Well, after searching the lobby and not being able to find them I inquired at the front desk. The hotel employee instructed me to follow her to a room, which could only be accessed by punching in a pass code, and there were the local attraction pamphlets. It appears they are moved to that area, where they aren't accessible to the guest, at some point in the evenings. Hummm? Why would they not leave the pamplets in the lobby at all times? What??? The Hyatt must think that eveyone travels with guide books and don't really need the pamphlets. Just another wierd \"going-on\" at this hotel. My suggestion would be for you to simply BUDGET A FEW MORE BUCKS AND STAY AT A BETTER HOTEL. THIS ONE IS NOT WORTH THE MORE THAN $100 PER NIGHT, unless the draw of the 42\" plasma TV (and it's proximity to Universal) is enough for you to overlook the hotels many shortcomings.", "Date": "November 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cA pleasant and comfortable place to stay near the airport\u201d", "Author": "Triptaker365", "ReviewID": "UR10577125", "Content": "This must be my best hotel bargain to date.

We've stayed in just about every conceivable accommodation in the area, from the $20 motor inns on 192 to the finest resorts in the area. This was our first experience with Amerisuites and were a little cautious with booking someplace than our usual stand-by hotel. While there are some exceptional stays on Major Blvd. there have been a few dubious ones. We both agree--this was the nicest, most comfortable stay we've ever had in Orlando. First, I booked our room via the hotel website (rather than a third party--always check both, you sometimes will get a better rate at one or another and if it's through the direct website you can avoid additional fees). The interface was simple, the reservation was guaranteed, and it was quickly handled. At $98 (for AAA members) the rate was very reasonable considering the time of year and location. Our stay was right on the cusp of Spring Break and the property was virtually yards away from the entrance to Universal Studios Resort, right within walking distance. The hotel is tucked away off of Major Blvd. and Kirkman on Caravan Ct. (right behind the long missed Mystery Fun House property). A plus is that the the property is flanked by a TGI Friday's and a Cracker Barrel. They are currently undergoing a change-over from Amerisuites to a Hyatt Place (scheduled to be finished in April 2007). Even though there is construction in the lobby it wasn't obstructive. Actually, it wasn't even really noticeable. The staff was very friendly and very attentive. The desk staff honestly seemed to care about our stay experience, something that too many of the hotels/resorts in the area seem to neglect. And housekeeping was an A++. The room, corridors, all the facilities were immaculate and I would swear they were ninjas--everything was always taken care of but we never saw them. And the room...oh the room! The hotel website had true to life, un-exaggerated images of the room. After the initial shock of the spacious size (advertised as 25% larger than the usual room and they weren't fibbing), the view (an Orlando-phile's dream), and all the wonderful amenities (full sized couch, king sized bed, 42\" flatscreen TV), we were pretty instantly relaxed and felt at home. Plus it had the most comfortable bed and pillows yet. My bad back didn't hurt once. We usually bring our own pillows but there were approximately 6 regular pillows and of those we only needed one. And we couldn't get over how clean everything was kept, especially the carpets which passed the white socks test. Now I know that part of the reason for being so over-the-moon about our stay is because that it was recently renovated and there is still a newness and 'honeymoon phase' attached to the hotel, but it honestly an amazing stay. We tried to come up with negative comments but the best we could do is that the elevator ran a little slow. That and the sun rose too early. Other than that it was a truly remarkable stay. Everything about our stay was beyond our expectations and it was just the thing we needed for a short relaxing weekend away.

From the front desk, to the food staff to housekeeping.

Thought it would be convenient for walking to Universal where we planned to spend the day and night for New Years Eve. When we checked in they took our names, but said they were unabe to give us our room keys. When we came back at midnight they had given 2 of the 8 Prepaid rooms away. Then told us we had to drive to the Amerisuites by the airport. Just what we wanted to do - get on the higway on New Years Eve. It was an interesting and scary drive, many accidents. We Were Not Happy, this is what we were trying to avoid by being able to walk. They accomodated us the following day with a room at the Universal property, so we moved back to be with the rest of our group. After much talk back and forth over the next few weeks they gave us a certificate for a free night stay at any of their Five Florida locations. When I called to redeem my certificate they told me the hotel would be under construction for the date we wanted and we would need to stay at the aiport hotel location which would accept our certificate. So I made my reservation with the approval of the manager at the Airport location. I called back to find out about leaving our car there until we got back from the flight we were taking. We are now told that we can't stay at that location with our certificate, we have to stay at the orginal location which will be under construction. Today, when I called the corporate guest relations, I found out they have a new management company and the bottom line is they really don't care what happened in December/January because they didn't manage it then - The new management (Hyatt) is just as bad as the old.

After reading some mixed reviews of this hotel, I called ahead to express some of my concerns regarding bedding, etc. Debbie, who took my call and greeted me when we arrived later that evening, was absolutely wonderful. I explained to her that I had serious problems with my spine and absolutely had to have a good mattress (no springs, good padding, etc). She told me the manager would be checking on the mattress and there would be sheets, blanket and pillows for the sofa as I requested. We checked in after 7pm. At first glance, the room was wonderful for the price we paid ($62 a night AAA Discount). We were actually considering making this a regular place to stay. The first thing we checked was that the sheets were there for the sofabed. They were not. There also was about a 1/4 roll of toilet paper and no extra pillows. My boyfriend headed down to the front desk and requested the sheets, extra pillows and a roll of tp (Once again, Debbie was great). We then headed out to Universal to catch the last night of the 360 Cinesphere, dinner and a movie (we're passholders). It was my boyfriends birthday. When we returned and settled into our room, the bad experience began. First, the room smelled musty but better than the hallway. We made the sofa bed for my 6 yr old son. It was so uncomfortable, he begged to sleep with us. So we tried puting the mattress on the floor for him. At that point we realized it wasn't the bars on the sofabed it was the mattress itself. Upon turning the sheets down on the king bed, I realized that I could feel all the springs with my hand on the edge of the mattress. When I got into the bed, there was a spring poking me in my ribs and upon looking up there was a huge water stain on the ceiling (hence the musty smell) between the bed and work area. We all slept in some strange positions that night. The toilet ran all night long, but with the door closed and the ac running you could barely hear it. This was kind of ironic considering, the water pressure wouldn't even flush a piece of toilet paper without flushing 3 times. Needless to say we were not very well rested in the morning. I called the front desk in the a.m. for a late 2 pm check out as a Hyatt Gold member. We had intended on spending the day enjoying the pool (we never did use the pool, but it looked clean and the people in it said it was nice ). The person who was at the front desk that morning could use a good lesson in customer service. She told me, \"You can have the room until 1 pm, but if we need it, you'll have to clear out.\" I couldn't believe my ears. What kind of answer is that? We decided to get ourselves together and check out. There were 2 towels for 3 people and eventhough there was a housekeeping cart on our floor, the housekeeper was nowhere to be found for at least 2 hours. So showers for everyone were out of the question. My boyfriend and son got to shower. I called and requested a towel that never came. Then came the straw that broke the camels back so to speak. My boyfriend went in to use the bathroom and the toilet overflowed. I called the front desk immediately to inform them maintenance was needed desperately as the toilet was overflowing and I had to go to the bathroom. The front desk clerk asked me if it was overlfowing onto the floor and I replied no because I had shut off the water to the tank but it was right up to the top of the bowl and I had to go badly and didn't want to leave maintenance a \"present\" if you get my drift. I was assured someone would be up immediately. Fourty five minutes later, no maintenance, no towel, no shower, no toilet and I was humiliated to have to go the bathroom (poop) in a toilet that what up to the rim with waste water splashing on me but could not hold it not another second. We did see the housekeeper on the way out. He was getting a plunger from a utility room right next to ours and knocking on the wrong door. I could not have been more embarrassed or wanted to leave this hotel faster. When I got to the front desk, I was asked if everything on my bill was correct. I explained that we did not use the safe and the other issues we had with the room. The clerks response was \"Sorry.\" That's it, just sorry. I informed her that I was very upset that I had to go home without a shower and had to poop in an overlfowing toilet. I was absolutely mortified!! Again she repeated \"Sorry.\" I told her at that point that we won't be staying here again and I'll e-mail management about my problems since she didn't seem to give a hoot. She basically looked at me blankly and said nothing. We never got to check out the free breakfast or the pool. At this point, I just wanted to get home and take care of my hygene. Other minor things are, there was only one waste basket in the room, one in the bathroom and no liners. Keep in mind this room has a small kitchenette, seperate living, sleeping and work areas. The curtains are cut short so the ac blows behind the curtains instead of into the room and daylight floods the room at the crack of dawn. We used the deskpad from the work area on top of the ac and leaned it into the window on top of the curtains so air would blow into the room instead of between the window and the curtain. The carpet had several large white stains at the foot of the bed. We never did figure out what it was, we just side stepped that area. The refrigerator didn't keep anything cold, but the room temperature bottled water in your room was a nice touch. When we first got there I couldn't understand what all the bad reviews were about. I felt like we had found a hidden gem right across from Universal and decently priced for the area. After an overnight stay, I get what the bad reviews are about.

The rooms are spacious enough to be able to spread out and not have to sit on the bed to use a computer or eat dinner. The breakfast was very tasty and a bonus after our stay at a hotel in Daytona that didn't provide anything. My only complaint about the entire stay was the air conditioning unit was very noisy making it difficult to sleep if we left it running.
