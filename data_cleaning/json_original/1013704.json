By my experience, hotels standards here lower than let's say in Portugal or Spain. Nevertheless, quite impressed with this one. It's on a back street, away from the tourist trail, and very quiet. It's 20m walk to rialto, right off the riva biasio boat stop, so perfect for airport taxi drop-off. If I could change anything, would be the rather stiff mattress, provide proper WiFi coverage (not the rubbish 5 hour voucher coupon to poor coverage), and actually have some international tv channels, rather than 20 Italian ones.

As others have said, it's a bit tricky to find initially - doesn't help that there's no large sign outside with the hotel name on, but once you've found it it's so easy to find again and again, and the lack of signage means the hotel blends in well with the other buildings around it. The hotel is a 5 min walk from San Stae on the Grand Canal which is the closest stop on the Orange Line for getting the Alilaguna from the Airport. Its about a 15 minute walk to Per Rialto, and about 30 minutes to Per San Marco. It's so nice to retreat away from the more lively places back through the quiet old Venetian streets back to this hotel. Only slight grumble is we had upgraded in advance to a superior room, which are on the 3rd floor.

The bathroom was spotless with all of the extras you could need, even a shoe shine kit - and the hair dryer was better than the one i have at home (which i had packed 'just incase') ...also the actual shower itself was lovely, a MASSIVE shower head, heavenly after a long days walking around beautiful Venezia! The attention to detail and the cleanliness in this hotel is immense, both in our room and in public areas. I really reccomend it - stop your search for the perfect accommodation now and book here. Just fantastic. As for location, i found it to be perfect, when i read reviews on here i expected to be miles out but your really not, you're right near the train station which is a really buzzing area, (called ferrovia), but you are indeed up a side street so you dont get any noise. Spot on really. I found breakfast to be excellent, continental of course but a huge amount of choice, - the ham and eggs is lovely, toast, breads, pastrys, all the jams under the sun, cold meats, soft cheese, fruits, yogurts, british cereals, i could go on youre spoilt for choice really, - i was sad that i'm not a big eater at breakfast time as it was all so nice haha. In a nutshell, you wouldnt regret booking this amazing hotel in this amazing city, just brilliant, the photos dont even do it justice.

The hotel location is very convenient as its close to the vaporetto's first stop on Line1. You can also walk from the train or bus station. From the hotel, walking to Rialto is confusing at first but once you get your bearings, you should be able to go around the sestiere (district) easily. Most of Venice's sights can be accesssed from there (30mins walk max) and you can always go for the vaporetto when tired. The hotel is very, very clean. Everything feels brand new without altering the charm of the old building it occupies. The bathroom was well-equipped and tidy. Staff was very helpful and pleasant. Because of the way the lobby is designed, you can't always see that there's actually someone there but even when we had to ring, the person in charge was always there to help us out. The breakfasts were good which is a big plus compared to the usual Italian fare. The other comments are right about the awkward table design in the breakfast room but it did not prevent us from enjoying our meals every morning. The downside: our room was on the ground floor and hence a little dark (but we didn't stay there during the day..obviously). We could hear people talking loudly and drinking on Saturday night but they were probably lost tourists as this area is really quiet at night (by the way, the whole of Venice is rather quiet at night.... but this area is dead calm so sleep is usually undisturbed).

It channels the spirit of Venice but with a clean, modern twist. It's hard to find but that could be said of most places in Venice! I think it would help if the hotel gave out more in the way of official directions as it's really not that complicated once you've got your bearings. We read reviews on TripAdvisor suggesting the easiest way to reach this hotel is to take the Riverbus 1 to Riva di Biasio from the main train station and turn right. On balance, this is probably true, but it's slightly frustrating to have to work out the water bus ticketing system and the correct pier for a bus going in the right direction to then go one stop (2 mins on board in total). When we were leaving Venice, we walked to the station and it took 10 minutes and cost nothing (although you do need to cross the Grand Canal and that means a bridge, and steps). This technicality aside, we found the hotel welcoming and efficient. Breakfast was an excellent buffet selection. We stayed two nights and on the first day, there was a power cut. Staff did not acknowledge this but could obviously not offer any hot drinks or toast at breakfast as a result. We were left confused by this until the second day when the power was clearly back on and hot drinks/food available again. A sign explaining the issue (and perhaps apologising for the inconvenience) wouldn't have gone amiss. This hotel isn't in central Venice, this is a short trip down the Grand Canal (or you can easily walk back through the maze of canals and passages), but this is a benefit rather than a disadvantage. It means you don't have to do battle with the crowds to get to your hotel and you get a flavour of the \"real\" Venice - there are local bars and shops.

It is a small hotel in the San Croce district, deceptively nondescript from the outside, yet once inside, abundant marble, lovely staircases, warm and very lively decor, just minutes from San Marco and the Rialto bridge. We found it easily right off the Vaparetto as others have remarked. You do need to follow the directions as one is easily and quickly lost in Venice's winding and tall alleys, charming later not so much when first arriving tired with suitcases. The front desk staff were consistently patient and very helpful, the staff throughout the hotel were very friendly. Our room was very clean, It had a jetted bath/shower, and views of rooftops, and the narrow street, at first disappointing, but I grew to enjoy it as you start to notice the varied balconies, shutters, potted plants. Generous breakfast was included with scrambled eggs, bacon and other cold meats, cheeses, greens, tomatoes, canned peaches, yogurts, dry cereals, breads, pastries, and fresh fruit. Many families stayed there as well as couples, the venue appeared to work well for both. Coffee, espresso, cappuccino, tea, cocoa served by the friendly server, as noted in another review, and at no additional fee. Any time you spend on how to read the street signs will not be wasted. I found the maps not that helpful, but looked for landmarks, and by the end of the second day was feeling more comfortable, very comfortable, moving from San Marco/Rialto to the hotel, a 15-20 min walk. Easy easy easy to get lost, which was never scary, Venice feels so safe, however, one helpful hint is to key to the posted (written on walls, usually in yellow, some added as hand written notes on arches--none consistent, but often enough to be helpful) main directions for the Rialto and San Marco, and then your closest vapporetto. Recommend San Marco visit early in the day, you will find a line by 0830, it opens at 0945, but worth it, and you are waiting in the shade, unlike later when the line is longer, and in the sun. Go right upstairs (before the crowds), it cost about five euros, but the view is stunning both of the cupola mosaics, and then outside, the grand canal and square. Another reason to stay at Ca' Zusto: it is close to a very wonderful restaurant, \"Trattoria Al Ponte Del Megio\" just a two minute easy walk from the hotel, get a table on the canal people watch while enjoying some of the best food Venice has to offer. Other: AIr conditioner worked very well and was adjusted easily. Elevator worked well to the second floor. A separate smaller elevator from second to third, I could not get it to work--but perhaps it was simply too slow and I did not wait long enough. This second one will fit only one person, and if in a wheelchair, would recommend you ck dimensions,feasibility.

The easiest route to the hotel is the water taxi from the train station, which is fine if you are buying a 1, 2 or 3 day water taxi pass (and you should), but don't buy a single 6.50 euro ticket to go one stop. Walking works if you don't mind carrying your luggage up the bridge steps. Just be sure to cross the bridge in front of the train station, then try to follow their instructions. We did find it. The hotel was quite comfortable with a very friendly, helpful staff. We really liked our room. The only complaint was from our son and his wife in a separate room - they had no shower stall, just a curtain, so the bathroom was soaked each time they took a shower. I believe it was a room for the physically challenged. (Incidentally, Venice is not easily navigated by people with disabilities.) The breakfast is good.

The hotel is well located - quite close to the station and along the \"main drag\" between there and St Mark's Square.

The distance isn't a problem at all, and it's not hard to find, but there _are_ two bridges (with stairs) to cross on the way, so consider that if you're lugging suitcases. It's a very modern and renovated place (in an old building). It's listed as four stars and looks it. Quite luxurious, but small and a bit fancier than we needed. And not \"luxurious\" to us in the ways that we find most important. For example, the shower was tinier than most, and the fittings (though modern) don't work well in it. Breakfast was so-so. Nice to have proper coffee and fancy little jams. But the croissants and eggs were no better than places half this price. The only real inconvenience though was the AC - it didn't run, and we suspect the staff were lying about why. The room was quite warm (with not much of a breeze from the windows), and the air-conditioning either didn't work or wasn't turned on. Friends who'd just visited Venice warned us that might be the case - something about laws about the date they can start activating it...? But they also warned us the hotel would be liable to lie to us about the problem. That's pretty much exactly what happened.

If you do walk from the train station, I would recommend that you print out the walking directions from Google maps ahead of time (from Santa Maria Novella Station to the hotel), as the highlighted path shown is very accurate and also shows names of restaurants and buildings that you should pass by on your way to the hotel, so you know you're on the right track (don't rely on street signs/names, as these are not always available). Once you're near the hotel, you'll see a sign on a building that says Campo Rielo and the entrance to the hotel is on the other side of this building.

The location near the train station and Piazzale Roma can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beat. It is easy to get to with a minimum of hauling luggage. You just take the #1 Vaporetto two stops from Piazzale Roma to Riva De Biasio, turn left, pass an alley and then make a right at the first street and it is about 50 meters on your right. Or if you are coming from the train station catch the #1 Vaporetto from Ferrovia and it is one stop to Riva De Biasio. Going to the airport even at the crack of dawn is equally as simple. There is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153N\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Vaporetto to Piazzale Roma where you can catch the #5 bus to the Airport. There is absolutely no need for a water taxi at $110 Euros. There is no dragging luggage over bridges and for long distances or getting lost trying to find your hotel through a maze of streets. You go about a block to a non-descript entrance on your right (zoning issues in Venice prevent big signs) with two classy looking little potted trees in the front and a glass door. Push the button for entrance and you are in the middle of a 14th century former home of the Zusto family (merchants who traded with the Jewish/Palestinian population in Venice - there is still a Star of David over an entrance that can be seen in the courtyard.) Lovely little courtyard, color scheme, and staff there to greet you. Some people may want to be closer to St. Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square and the Rialto but I found the crowds to be overwhelming and thought the Vaporetto ride down the Grand Canal each morning and evening, a tour in and of itself and the best deal in town given the price of tickets. It is also a wonderful photo opportunity for remembering this lovely city as well. If you have time to walk, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great opportunity to see the back streets and less visited areas and Piazzas. Because the hotel is small the staff is always available and tremendously helpful and professional. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there a full day and was given directions to and tickets for the Opera and other venues. Breakfast was a delight and service very good. I did have a problem with the airconditioning, however, it was fixed immediately the next day with workmen awaiting my exit from the room that morning to address the issue. When I left at 3:30 am for the airport, the desk clerk actually helped me with my luggage to the Vaporetto Stop! Ten minutes later he appeared again, assisting another couple with their luggage! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been in a lot of hotels and this is one of the most memorable in terms of customer service and ambiance. You won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be disappointed!", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ripon, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel - made our trip perfect!\u201d", "Author": "treacle1234", "ReviewID": "UR84124201", "Content": "We came to Venice for a short break and it couldn't have been better. Flew into Treviso with Ryan Air and took a short 40 minute bus journey (5 euro payable at the airport desk) into Venice. The hotel is then a 10 minute walk from the station. It is reasonably easy to find if you locate it on a map before you arrive and remeber what it looks like from the outside! We were checked in by very friendly staff, nothing is too much hassle and they recommend good places to see and eat and directions to the tourist spots. The rooms were clean and comfortable, complimentary toiletries, slippers, flat screen TV's and an Ipod dock. Breakfast was simple but just what you need, juices, tea, coffee, breads, pastries, meat, cheese, cerial, yoghurts and fresh fruit. It is only a 10-15 minute stroll to the rialto and a further 5 minutes to st marks square. The vaparetto (water bus) is just at the end of the street. We only used it once for the experience as everything is in walking distance of the hotel. Only negative point - The wireless internet doesn't work on the 2nd floor. We were offered an ethernet cable for a laptop but only needed it for our phone, the internet does work in the communal seatig area on the first floor though.

The hotel staff was the best on my trip and before I got there. I emailed the hotel staff about transportation, sights and directions and they responded promptly and thoroughly every time helping me plan my trip. The bathtub had spa jets! The property is very colorful with some floors very pink/purple and others a bright blue, but it gives the property character. The hotel also has a welcoming event for its guests one/two nights a week where they host cocktails. They have a great staff which joins you and you can ask for their inputs on things to do and mingle with other guests staying on the property.
