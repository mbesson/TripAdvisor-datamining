This was first travel experience for us to any European country but the friendly staff at this place really made us feel at home. It is the friendly service that makes it worthwhile staying in this hotel. The reception team was always ready to help and they also guided us for local site seeings we could do with limited time we had after the business activities. The room we had was spacious and pretty, the breakfast is good (Considering Germany is tough place for veterinarians) and the distance to any place in Berlin is not a issue as the Tube station is next to hotel.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Budapest, Hungary", "Title": "\u201cVery good location, excellent business services\u201d", "Author": "Pietro_HU", "ReviewID": "UR96269468", "Content": "The Hotel is pretty close to Berlin Tegel Airport.

The hotel also has a swimming pool though it was freezing when I was there in winter time (but it summer it should work well). Hotel staffs and receptionists, though they don't speak English very well, but they try to help as much as possible consideing the tourists attractions information. The underground metro station is located next to the hotel, and it takes you around 20 - 30 minutes to reach the city center (Kurfurstendamm and Postdamer Platz areas, or the Berlin Hauptbahnhof). The hotel is located quite far from the city centre (though perhaps it is one of the reason why the price is affordable because apparently it is hard to get the same price with the same facility at the city centre). Nearby the hotels are supermarkets, restaurants and cafes. The only weak point is just the location, othet than that it was great.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cGood budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "wensdazechyld", "ReviewID": "UR52444073", "Content": "Staff were LOVELY. restaurant - limited menu and pricey for what you get.
