My girlfriend and I booked this hotel well before any of these bad reviews were posted and were very concerned about the place. Entirely Without Reason!! We really enjoyed our stay there and would definitely stay there again. The hotel was in good condition, our room was very clean, we used the airconditioning 24/7 (we arrived during the recent heatwave, 35-39 degrees!) and it worked well. The hotel is a very short walk from the railway station and was suprisingly quiet! In fact it was lovely to wake up to the distant toll of church bells. Our room overlooked the lovely roof garden  we could see the roof of the San Lorenzo chapel and the Duomo. The hotel is perfectly placed to visit the plethora of attractions of Florence - everywhere is in very easy walking distance. I must take issue with a few things in previous reviews. The staff were as friendly and helpful as all Italians are. Like all people if you are polite they will respond in kind! Italians are animated and vocal in conversation - this could be why one reviewer believed the hotel staff were arguing outside their room. The staff only worked on the corridors after 8am on vacant rooms. You really should be out of bed by then - go enjoy Florence! The buffet breakfast was excellent. The staff coped well when the place was full. We saw only one homeless person (well behaved too) near the hotel through the week - hardly a problem. Italy is a country of many smokers - there is bound to be one crafty smoker among the hotel staff. Italians cannot smoke in restaurants or bars anymore so this is not a problem. I don't smoke but I think a little more tolerance  appreciation of the fact that you are in a different country with a whole different culture is needed.

We thought it was a joke or something because our hotel in Rome had been so nice; it was literally one extreme to the next!While checking out the bathroom I touched the shower door and it literally broke in my hand; came right off the hinge and there was a huge piece of porcelin missing from the top of the toilet. My aunt and uncle were also on tour with us and the toilet in their room had no water in the tank so it couldn't be flushed. My aunt called down to the front desk to tell them about it as soon as we arrived and was told someone would be up to fix it, however no one ever arrived. I also told them about the shower door in our room but didn't see anyone to fix that before we left the following morning. Oh, and there is a piece of plywood between the boxspring and the mattress.

Also, the same girl that checked us in at 3 p.m. was still on duty at 7 a.m. the next morning when I turned in our key. Later in the evening the entire hotel was overcome with the unbearable stench of sewer which was unescapable. We did get an explanation regarding the air conditioning from our tour director. Believe it or not because of all of the energy saving that Italy is involved in, air conditioning is strictly regulated  is prohibited from being turned on before May 1st! So even if your hotel has air conditioning and it's hot before May 1st, you won't be able to use it in your hotel room because they aren't allowed to turn it on.

Two of us checked - in the hotel on December 28th and the rest of the group (4 adults and a dog) arrived on December 30th at 22:00 only to be informed that the hotel was overbooked.The hotel staff very rudely infromed us that they would either relocate half of our group in a hotel 5 km away or else return our money and leave us without a room one day before New Year's eve.The hotel they offered to relocate us to did not accept pets and was not walking distance from Florence.When we protested and asked for Tourist Police they completely ignored us. Never apologised and thy did not compensate our trouble in anyway.stay away!!!", "Date": "Feb 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR385267522", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Masi4"}, {"Content": "Needs Renovation Old, outdated and poor value.

I had read all the other reviews before I arrived so I knew what to expect. However, the hotel is not as bad as the worst of the reviews, but certainly not as good as some of the others.On the plus side my room was of a good size, had plenty of storage space and a large bathroom.But - there was a lot of mould around the shower, a thick layer of dust on the tissue holder behind the bathroom door and lots of greasy fingerprints over the stainless steel toilet rool holder.Similarly, in the bedroom there was a thick layer of dust on both window sills (behind the net curtains!), a couple of glasses and a packet of nuts on a very dirty serviette beside the television, and - again - lots of greasy fingerprints on the control panel for the radio (which did not work) behind the bed. Like many of the other reviewers mentioned, the mattress on my bed also had a suicidal tilt.........The air conditioning also did not keep the room cool - although, to be fair - the temperature in Florence was nearly 40 degrees while I was there.Breakfast in the dining room was OK - but I did notice ants crawling on the table by the open bowls of jam one morning.My overall impression was that the hotel certainly had seen better days and was sorely in need of a complete revamp. It has the potential to be a really nice hotel - it is in a very convenient position for all the major sights (and the railway station), but as things are at the moment I certainly would not stay there again.", "Date": "Sep 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR965618666", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Ex-skiier"}, {"Content": "Check Out!!! On the hottest 2 days in Florence (98), this hotel offered NO air conditioning anywhere. Fans were blowing, but there was no escape from the heat, even after management changed our rooms and others up to 4 times. Beds were disgracefully tilted and worn out; if cleanliness is next to Godliness, this hotel is hell. You could smell the rot and decay of a hotel that has been sadly neglected.

We stayed at this hotel in July 06, and I was a bit worried having read the review below before we left!The hotel is a fallen beauty, yes. It probably was a luxury hotel in the 60ties or 70ties, but nothing seems to have been done since then. But you can still see traces of that majestic hotel it once probably was. We had a nice room with a king size double bed, which was quite comfortable. The room was away from traffic, so we were not bordered bu noice. The AC was struggling hard to keep the room cold in the Florence heat, but it managed. This is more a two star than a four star hotel, mainly because of the need of refurbishing.
