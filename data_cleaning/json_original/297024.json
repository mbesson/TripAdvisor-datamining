The rooms were cute and clean but a little small. The bathroom was rather new and clean. There was adequate heating of the room and a nice TV. Unfortunately no balconies just windows, but we visited during winter so it didn't really matter! The breakfast was satisfactory, not something special but fine (cereals, yogurt, bread, cheese, ham, honey, marmalade, coffee, tea, milk- I think they should have some fruit and vegetable). There was a bit of noise since our room was at the side of a rather busy street, but not something very annoying. The only problem I would point out is that there was not a double bed as we had asked but two single beds put one next to the other.

We took the Leonardo express from Fiumicino airport to Termini Station, but the train ends at Roma Lazialli station. To get to Termini station you have to walk about 300 meter, but the best is to leave Lazialli station on the Via Giovanni Giolotti side and then take the tram that is in front of the station. Get out at the first stop en walk about 200 meter. Traveling into the old town, we walked ca. 230 meter to Piazza di Porta Maggiore. There we could find a lot of buses and trams to all kind of different destinations. The only minor was the absence of WiFi for the guests.

We also really enjoyed the breakfast; sweet croissants, normal rolls, plenty of sandwich filling, orange juice, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, yoghurt, etc. It was maybe a bit common, but for a cheap hotel it was really decent. The only thing was the reachableness of the centre of Rome. We could easily walk to the Termini Station or the Colosseum, but further asked for much time. We were glad that there was a metro station in the neighborhood; Manzoni. Over all, it's a good location. It's a cheap hotel with great rooms and a decent breakfast, and it's very clean.

House keeping wasn't completed by 1pm. We went out for the morning to come back to our beds still un made. To my understanding there was only one girl who did all of the rooms.

I'm sure it was the communication barrier but her overall attitude was not helpful or pleasent. She could not even help me when my wallet was stolen. She couldnt even tell me if there are any decent shops around the area. Couldnt even begin to help me with my phone card or telling me where i could have access to internet.

We paid \u00a3141 for four nights and would think that would be very difficult to beat anywhere for 2 people B&B. It is well located for geting around the sights in Rome and only a ten minute walk to the Termini Station. I've been twice now and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.

The only fault we could find is that some members of the staff can come across as being rude, possibly due to the limited understanding of English.

(Aug.2005) Outside the lift was a massive hole with a board covering it.... Each time my party came into the lift or exited, we always tripped. One of us was elderly....Not good enough... The area was very dodgy.... Pick pockets, red light area....and the walk from Termini station takes at least 15/25 minites. Road works all along the road. No buses... Not recommended late at night. Unpleasant area and a long way from the centre. The outside terrace looked more like a scrapyard....a mess. I was kept awake most nights by several young men sharing a room.
