The external approach of the hotel is an indication of what to expect, a dilapidated state, showing a lack of care and maintenance. This general theme is continued through the service recieved by staff. Our room was on the fifth floor, and we arrived at night. While the idea of having corridor lighting on a timed switch may be environmentally friendly, it would be much more useful if the lights stayed on long enough for us to get to our ant-infested room. The room was advertised as a three bed room, but was in fact two singles and a sofa, and the bedding was not changed at all during our stay. The bathroom had notices that you were to leave you towels on the floor if you required new ones. However every night we cam back over the whole week we stayed there, they were still on the floor when we returned in the evening. The hair dryer in the bathroom was appaling, as effective as an asthmatic dog breathing on you and emitted a smell of burning electrics. The television had no remote control- not the biggest problem however. The breakfast was possibly the worst point of the stay, it was literally a selection of processed meats a plastic cheese with stale bread rolls. Or the option of mueseli with some room temperature milk, that i doubt had been chilled at all. The hotel management on the second night of the stay demaned a security deposit from our group due to damages allegedly caused by us during our stay, despite the fact the damages were clearly old and had been there probably since the hotel was last decorated (likely pre-dating the fall of the wall). The alternative to paying the deposit was that they would kick us out. They said that the deposit would be against any further damages, however the following morning they decided to keep the deposit, and again threatened us with turfing us out. We were a large group of about 50 people, on a study visit, however there seemed to be some confusion between us and another large group of students also staying the hotel, and as such we were all treated as one mass group. On the final day we asked that we could leave our bags in the hotel as we were not due to leave berlin till late afternoon. The management wanted 3 euros per person, which isnt unreasonable as local secure storage cost roughly the same. However, the secure storage room the hotel promised turned out to be an adjacant disused store front, with the entire groups bags on full display to passers by. If anybody has seen guesthouse paradiso or fawlty towers and laughed at the notion of a hotel that bad, think again that places like that actually exist. Avoid this Hotel at all costs.

The wildlife in the rooms was a bit unexpected, most of the rooms had an infestation of ants. The service from the management was nothing short of appalling, one of my colleagues was given a room that had previously suffered some minor damage, the management wanted 300 Euro for this and would not accept that the damage existed prior to our arrival, the money was demanded with menaces i.e. pay up or get out. The condition the rooms varies from reasonable to disgraceful, allocation is all down to luck of the draw. Fire doors throughout the building where wedged open, despite our concern and action to remove wedges staff continued to disregard the risk of fire spread. On checking out we asked to leave our cases until our transport arrived, again the management where quick to exploit the situation in seeking 100 euros for the use of an adjacent disused shop front.

My family and I ( 5 people in total) booked this hotel online in June using a credit card. I called the hotel after my father booked it online and they said that the booking and payment had been received. The 155 Euros was taken out of my parents account. I called a few days before our stay about parking. The person saying you could park on the street outside the hotel. - As we arrived we were shocked. The hotel was situated between 2 shut down shops with boarded up windows. Not a nice first impression. We went inside and I gave our name, which they had no record of, even though I called up straight after the booking and they said it was there. So, they said that they have a free room anyway. Fine. Then, the lady wrote us a bill for 155 Euros which we had to pay. But, we had already paid. The money was out of my parents credit card account. So, luckily my parents have online banking and were able to show them that we had already paid. Which they still didn't believe. The woman then called the manager over who wasn't the most helpful chap in the world. He said that we have to pay 155 euros. He had no record of our money being paid. He said that they take credit cards online to make sure that the people booking the hotel are real. They then take the money from the account and pay the money back in within 10 days. The money (after nearly 3 months) was not back in my parents account. He said that he had no access to our accounts, and that it was done through another banking system. We would have to pay on arrival. So, he said he was going to look through his bank details and credit card company to ask where the money was. He said that if the next day, there was still no sign of the money in his account we should pay the 155 Euros and then at some point the other 155 euros would be back in my parents account. - So we went up to the room. 5 beds is what we needed. 5 beds is what we got. 5 single beds in one room - a family room. Lovely. Definately not what was booked. Also on the back of the door, there was a notice about prices per night. starting at 200Euros PP/PN? That made no sense at all. Plus, the parking outside the hotel was not outside the hotel as that was illegal. We had to park the car on the next street which cost 7Euros. Then my dad had to pay another 50Euros (which you get back when you give the ticket for the car window back) So, we went back downstairs and said that we were leaving. Not happy with the service or room. The guy then said we have to pay 80% of the fee if we were not staying there. No way. So I said, 'what if I go out of the door now and don't pay you that 80%, seeing as you can't access our bank details?' he said that he had to trust us to pay it. - uh huh - BYE BYE! --- So, a word of advice.

The rooms are tiny and very basic. TV has no remote (not a big deal I know but not what you would expect from a 3 star hotel). The bathrrom had just about enough room for a tiny shower and toilet bowl and sink. The beds are small and very close together with no room to move them apart. There was little ot no room service or cleaning on our room, and no \"do not disturb\" signs to put on the door. All in all I think that this hotel is an absolute RIP-OFF and A COMPLETE SCAM.
