Only a short 5 minute walk from Paddington Tube station (with trains to Heathrow every 15mins as well), with plenty of good shops, restaurants and things to do close by; the location couldn't be more perfect. Overall, I would definitely stay at this hotel again. The breakfast was fantastic -- choice between English (fry up -- eggs, bacon, beans, tomato, hash brown etc.), or continental (yogurt, jam, cereal etc.). The hotel has no lift, however, and the staff do not offer to carry your bags up the stairs which are very narrow. So if you have lots of luggage and/or are elderly/infirm or have small children, perhaps this hotel isn't a good choice for you. Our triple room was rather small, but nothing to complain about. It was clean, bright, and neat. The heating in the room was a little too intense and we always had to open the window. Also it was a little disappointing that basic toiletries were not provided, but this is only a very minor complaint. We really liked that there was a TV in the room with plenty of channels to choose from. Also, we enjoyed the free WiFi. Just go down to reception and ask for the password. On account of the heat in the room, it did take us a while to drift off to sleep, but once again, nothing major to complain about. The staff at reception aren't particularly friendly -- particularly on arrival we didn't recieve a warm welcome, but the breakfast ladies were very hospitable.

Firstly booking the Holland Court Hotel, which upon further inspection would not appear to be out of place in a Nairobi Shanty, and secondly booking the Dolphin Hotel in Paddington, who cancelled our booking via email without informing hotels.com. So with our fingers well and truly burnt we were forced to rebook the night before we arrived. Considering this fact, we got a very reasonable deal on this hotel at \u00c2\u00a388.00 per room per night, staying for 4 nights over a weekend. Upon arrival we breathed a sigh of relief as the hotel appeared to be clean and respectable. However there were a few problems with our stay. I refuse to make a sweeping statement about the staff because the majority of those we encountered were lovely and very helpful. Nonetheless upon check in we were greeted by a receptionist who was less than enthusiastic about her job. Having handed her the email verifying our booking she insisted on keeping the email, regardless of the fact that it was our only proof of payment. When I refused she looked at me in disbelief, and after I suggested she photocopy the page she stated that she didn't know how to use the photocopier, and spent about 5 minutes grumbling trying to get it working. All very disconcerting for an establishment priding itself on the treatment of its customers. Having had a long flight we then decided to get a cup of tea, but there was no sugar in our room. I headed to the kitchen to grab some sugar sachets and was immediately asked by the same woman 'what are you doing here?' and when I explained myself she said 'no, you're not allowed', as if she were scorning a child. I really wouldn't have a problem with being informed that there was some alternative method of procuring sugar if I wasn't treated in this manner. If the receptionist for instance said, 'Sorry sir, but our dining room is currently closed, is there anything I can help you with?' it would have been much more acceptable. An extension of this gripe includes the housekeepers for the hotel. When running late for breakfast one morning my girlfriend kept her pjyama bottoms on so we'd get to the kitchen on time. Apart from this she was properly clothed and was even wearing shoes. In essence her bottoms were indistinguishable from sweatpants. Upon arrival in the kitchen one of the Polish girls working there shoed my girlfriend out of the kitchen berating her for turning up to breakfast in the bottoms. Announcing to the room that pjyama bottoms were not acceptable rather than taking the tactful approach of having a quiet word with us. To prove how pedantic a point this is, the next morning my girlfriend went to breakfast in the same pjyama bottoms while the owner was having breakfast. Whilst in the presence of the owner the housekeeper in question couldn't have been nicer to us, even telling us to have a nice day as we left the room. She didn't bat an eyelid at the fact that my girlfriend was wearing pjyamas this time. How does that old saying go? 'When the cat's away the mice will play.' In short, some members of the staff of this hotel have severe difficulties with common courtesy and tact, which annoys me as I work in a industry where our customer turnover is based on high standards of service. It's really not that much of an effort to be polite to people, especially in order to capitalise upon return sales. Having said all this, the majority of the staff we in fact very helpful, with several receptionists assisting us in acquiring numbers for restaurants and directions to attractions. I am in fact going to chalk some of this up to culture shock. Being from Dublin where everybody is very receptive I have become acclimatised to interaction with people I don't necessary know. This is epitomised for instance by people nodding to each other on the street or flashing a smile as they pass by. My girlfriend while in Paddington flashed a smile at an elderly couple, to which their reaction was one of shock. I have to say that the only night that felt remotely like home was when we went to an Aussie bar. I have come to the conclusion that English people are not as friendly as the Irish, but being rude to your own customers is really shooting yourself in the foot. Apart from my obvious grievances over manners, the hotel was generally nice. Our room was spacious and airy. The television was great. The breakfast was above and beyond what we were expecting, constituting an English fry. The rooms were clean, although there was some wallpaper peeling from the wall beside our window. The ensuites were clean. The only issue with the ensuite was that the shower was too powerful for the curtain and the floor often ended up wet, but it dried up quick enough. The price as aforementioned was very reasonable. The location was great. Paddington is full of nice little restaurants where we ate every night. Sussex Gardens itself is very picturesque with lines of whitewashed Georgian buildings, and Paddington station itself is on the Hammersmith, Circle, District and Bakerloo lines, making Piccadilly a five minute trip away, and everywhere else in London easily accessable. All in all I would recommend this hotel as its benefits heavily outweigh its detractors, but go being aware of the issues I have discussed.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swansea", "Title": "\u201cA little hiccup but solved quickly\u201d", "Author": "Abertawetraveller", "ReviewID": "UR74080905", "Content": "When arriving at this hotel with my husband, as the distance states it is only about a 3 minute walk from Paddington.

This was hardly an inconvienience as we could still return to the Europa for the English breakfast we had paid for. I have reviewed the Queensway as this is where we stayed in all. The only bad thing i would say is that the 2 ladies serving breakfast need an extra person as the breakfast was extensive, the continental my husband had consisted of cereal, croissants, yoghurt and ham and cheese and the English i opted for was a lovely start to the day.

Most of the staff seemed to have trouble understanding us, despite the fact that we speak english. However, the owners were very wonderful people that understood and helped us completely. The location is great. It is right by Paddignton station which connects pretty much anywhere you could want to go. There are plenty of places to eat right by there also. I would recommend the location to everyone! The rooms are very tiny so, if you're looking for a really nice hotel to spend lots of time inside, then this is not the right place. However, if you're anything like my friends and I, and want a comfortable place to sleep while you enjoy your time in London, I highly recommend this hotel! My only complaint is that our room was on the 3rd floor, so each day we had to hike up 60 steps to our room. This wasn't really an issue except when we were transporting our luggage up and down!...but hey, it was good exercise! Overall, if you're on a budget definitely stay here! It is probably the best value for your money!", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWould not recommend\u201d", "Author": "AvidTravellers56", "ReviewID": "UR23310604", "Content": "We agree with Mobsta from Bournemouth!! And from Mobsta's photos it looks like we stayed in the same room (first one at the top of the stairs!!) We were en route from Australia to Athens and spent 3 night stop over in London. Room so small you couldn't swing a cat and had to step over our suitcases to get around bed as hanging space was non-existent, radiator never heated up so freezing cold, 1 flat pillow each and no extras. As you will see by Mobsta's photos, the shower/toilet cubicle was terrible and you couldn't call it an ensuite like their web site does. We also took the same photos to show our friends.......... Rooms like this shouldn't be rented out until they're refurbished!!! Staffing: Every time we went to reception to leave/collect our room key or ask a touristy question, staff was on a \"personal\" call on his mobile phone and never ever interrupted his calls to deal with hotel guests - customer service??? Breakfast: The menu says eggs (plural) and bacon but you only received 1 and were ignored when you requested 2. We definitely would not stay here again nor recommend it. Fortunately all other accommodation during our 6 week holiday in Europe and the UK lived up to their web site spiels and photos .", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bournemouth", "Title": "\u201cNot good, Strange substances!!\u201d", "Author": "Robert M", "ReviewID": "UR21226867", "Content": "We have just returned form a 1 night stay the the Europa House Hotel. We stayed in Room # 4 which was quite a small room, with a double bed in it, which is normal for London, but the toilet/shower room was abysmal and there was a strange substance in the hand basin that was not identifiable but did resemble some kind of excrement. Also in the bedroom area there was some splatter marks on the lower wall which looked very similar to dried blood, which wasnt very nice at all. The room was 'simpy' decorated with a duvet blanket and one very flat pillow per side of the bed. The room was also very cold, although there was a radiator in the room it seems as if they are not using it as yet so the room was very cold. The best thing about the room was the flat screen Tv which had FREEVIEW satellite channels and a clear picture. Our room rate of \u00c2\u00a385per night including breakfast from Laterooms.com was quite high for the quality of the room and as the room was so horrible we didnt have much faith in the breakfast so we didnt bother going down for that. All in all, I wouldnt stay here again, not even for \u00c2\u00a350 per night!

But to be honest this place had the best reviews I could find for the amount of money I wanted to spend. And lets face it if you're there to sight see then all you need is a bed, shower and somewhere to keep your bags! So for me this was a budget accomodation that fulfilled that need. Better value than a backpacker's place! I had a single room on the first floor and the room was an ok size, just enough room to swing a cat ... but only just! 8-) (Check out my photos). Room was clean and tidy. Shower was awesome! Plenty of hot water (which is a pleasant surprise compared to some of the places we stayed in Europe). TV had many channels to watch so that was good to be able to relax and watch after a hard day wondering around. However the highlight of the stay was the full English breakfasts every morning! Awesome and a great way to start the day! Staff were friendly and helpful (although there were some minor communication difficulties with some staff members). My only complaint is the wall thickness. It was quite noisy between rooms and I could hear the people in the room next to me clearly. Also unlucky me in room next to a snorer! Street noise could be bad for some who are light sleepers, but for me I got used to it. Great location - close to Kensington gardens makes it easy to get into the city centre (just hop on the underground tube). So overall a great value budget accomodation place to stay if you just need a bed for the night and a starting base for your sight seeing.", "Date": "September 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairo, Egypt", "Title": "\u201cDISHONEST OWNER\u201d", "Author": "chunclam", "ReviewID": "UR16383444", "Content": "Stayed at Europa Ouse Hotel for 3 nights in the beginning of May. I was overall satisfied with the room and the service. But upon arriving home I realized that I had paid TWICE for the hotel bill.

But on my last day there I decided to 'get rid 'of some remaining cash, so paid half of the bill by cash and the rest with credit card. When I realized what had happened, I sent them an email immediatelty demanding for my money to be returned. It's been 2 weeks now since I initiated contact with them and after several emails, I still haven't heard from them. They chose to ignore my request and keep the money. I'm angry with their dishonesty and appalled that they choose to sacrifice their good name and reputation for a mere GBP124 (that's what they owe me).
