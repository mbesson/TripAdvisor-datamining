And the woman at the front desk could not have been nicer (gave us free breakfast coupons which we SLEPT through!) and she actually called the police twice. This aside, the location is great. Very close to the I-17, which was perfect for us as we live in Sedona. The rooms are spacious. There were some stains on the wall and carpet in the room. And the pillows were not that comfortable.

He cut the filler hose to the tank so we could not refill it. The manager was nice to lend us a DUCT tape so my husband can tape the filler hose together so we can go home to California. My husband made it work but the experience dampened our stay there for 3 nights. On top of that , we had a terrible experience during our 1st night. We were assigned to a room near the elevator. All night long, we could hear the elevator going up and down and we slept poorly. The bed was good but the sound was bothering us. I don't know why anyone was assigned to that room at all. We should have asked for them to move us in the middle of the night but we didn't want to repack our stuff in the middle of the night. They moved us to a room in the corner (end of the hotel). The room was just ok but the bed was terrible. In the beginning of the night it was firm but by morning, my side sank down like it had a leak or something. We parked our car at this end and I think it was a mistake. I wanted to give 1 star but the service from front desk was great in helping us to recover our bad experience. Also, the room was clean and nice (despite the bed). It is not the hotel's fault that a thief stole our gasoline so I gave a 2 stars. But overall experience was so bad that I can't give more stars. The hotel should provide more security and install a security camera in the premises. The gasoline that was stolen costs us $60 but to fix the hose, it costs us $160. It was the worst driving vacation for us.", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cMore than adequate\u201d", "Author": "Not-the-talc", "ReviewID": "UR87087005", "Content": "First impressions, it looked rather dowdy and shabby; the carpets have seen better days; the color scheme of all browns and low lighting contributed to this.

We asked what were the appetizers available for Happy Hour and she showed us the appetizers on the full menu rather than the bar menu which had a wider variety. We had ordered an entree to take to the room. When we finished an appetizer we waited for 20 minutes for her to return. We asked for a box and our bill. She did not come around for another 20 minutes. We asked the other servers to assist us and all they said was they would tell our server we need assistance. When she brought the bill she did not have our entree and had not turned in the ticket to the kitchen. We cancelled the entree and found we were charged full price for the half price appetizer we did have. It took another 15 minutes to get a correct bill. Tonight, we thought we would give it a second try as anyone can have an off day. Tonight we were served in a reasonable time and the server checked on us once. We had to ask for a box and for a bill. The bill again did not reflect the half off prices. Tonight it took more than 10 minutes to correct the error. If we were in a hurry we would have been very upset not just aggravated.

The trip back to the airport was just as quick, with scheduled service every half hour.

I noticed in another review that they had a flat screen television, however, my room did not. The room was clean and decorated in cheery yellow and blues.
