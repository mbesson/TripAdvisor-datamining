{"Reviews": [{"Content": "over the hill and far away Just spent 3 nights at the abba garden with family ( daughter 15 and son of 11) We had spent a week at port aventura and had wanted to finish our holiday with a few nights in Barcelona. This was our 4th visit to this beautiful city. Big mistake. Taxi from the station to the hotel got lost even though he had sat nav and the hotels address that had been given to us by our Thomas Cook rep. After much driving around back streets my wife phoned the hotel who guided the taxi driver to our destination. This happened again during our short stay. Hotel is adjacent to a hospital which is currently having some building work done so lots of large lorries / diggers etc around the front of the hotel. They are also building what looks like a new dual carriage way 100 yards from hotel which affects access. Hotel itself was clean but we have paid less and stayed in far better hotels. Pool is a bonus though in hindsight we defintley would have gone for a more central location. Don't stay here if you want easy access to the city. As mentioned in other reviews there is absolutley nothing around it.", "Date": "Aug 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR605508799", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "morecambeshrimp"}, {"Content": "Great hotel, far from downtown I stayed in the hotel with a Trafalgar tour group.

We choose this hotel as we knew it had a pool and was aware that it was outside of town. We wanted a quite place to relax and chill, as well as being able to sightsee and we were not disappointed. It is a good quality hotel with good sized clean rooms. At breakfast you had ample to choose from, a wide range of hot or cold (only disappointment there was that they didn't replenish the fried eggs!). There is a large bar area, inside and out. The pool is very big for the size of the hotel and well maintained. Unfortunately like another visitor remarked it was a shame that the loungers did not have plastic covers on as they became quite uncomfortable after a while. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, but the waiters could have been a little more welcoming! If you wanted to eat in the restaurant in the evening it would cost you 23 euros for a 3 course meal (not that we did). We found that the no. 63 bus could be caught just down from the hotel into the centre of town for 1.25 euros (each) and took about 20 mins. This meant that you avoided the long walk to the metro station (which was alright on the way there but tough walking back up the steep hill at the end of the day). However we did use the metro which again was 1.25 euros. We would definitely use this hotel again and would thoroughly recommend a trip to Barcelona.", "Date": "Jul 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR304233388", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "SussexJoey"}, {"Content": "check first we have just returned after a 5 day stay at this hotel. we chose it due to the out of town location, hoping to chill by the pool in nice garden settings!Beware the hard plastic loungers did not have any mattress covers on them,. so we could not relax as intended.

No good to us then.We had to then travel into Barcelona everyday which was quite a distance.On our last day my husband asked if he could sit on a chair from the outdoor patio area on the grass as it was more comfortable but they refused.Also beware of the pickpockets on the metro.

We were concerned that the location of the hotel would be problematic, but it was a welcome relief in the middle of July to go back to a lovely, clean and cool hotel with pool, sunbathing and spa areas for a late afternoon siesta and refresh after a morning of sightseeing and over indulgent lunches. Abba provide a bus to Zona Universitat metro stop, or take a walk through the gardens as we did, which are very pleasant, quicker and not as steep as the roads. Taxis are very cheap and reception will book them for you very quickly to the tube station if necessary, we enjoyed the walk and the thought of a quick dip in the pool after was a good way to work off the lunches. Metro is quick and simple to use (3 day passes good value for money 13E), be prepared though sometimes for a wait though at the end of the evening for taxi home.Excellent tapas and restaurants in Eixample, try Tragaluz couple of blocks up on the left from Passeig de Gracia tube.

The location of this hotel is absolutely awful. The closest metro station is Zona Universitaria and then you have about a 1km uphill walk. The hotel runs a tram from Monday to Saturday from 8am to 2pm and from 5pm to 8pm (so you can't get back during siesta) which is supposed to drop you at Maria Christina (a good metro station) but our experience is that they are sometimes lazy and drop you at Zona Universitaria instead. We also had one driver who floored the car right through a red light, taking all the guests lives at risk. You also need to call the hotel to get the tram to pick you up, it doesn't simply stop and pick up guests (we found that out the hard way). The tram doesn't run on Sunday at all. Remember that this is Spain, where normal dinnertime is 10PM. There is no way to get back from the hotel after dinner except by taxi, since even the bus that goes near the hotel stops at 10:30PM. Buses are 63, 78 and 22. The buses are located about 200m from the hotel, down a small hill. If you are travelling by Metro late at night, take the Metro to Maria Christina and hail a taxi from there, it's the closest station with a lot of traffic.If you were hoping for a local shop to pick up some supplies, you will not find any. This is a residential location with nothing around.The hotel had a fire on the 15th of April (electrical malfunction of the dry sauna). The gym is therefore unavailable and many of the rooms, hallways and especially the elevators smell of burnt wood.The room itself was well equipped and with the usual amenities. A few TV channels in many different languages including English, French, German, Spanish and Polish. The beds were very hard (too hard for us, but that's a personal preference). The decor was contemporary European and spacious. There is a minibar in the room and enough room to put your own bottle of water for storage in the fridge.The hotel bar prices were not unusual for a hotel. Dinner was available early, for those who have trouble with Spanish dinner time. The restaurant prices were reasonable. The restaurant was small and sometimes caters to tour groups which caused them to turn away people. There are only two other (expensive) restaurants that are even within walking distance of the hotel. The food at the restaurant was good, though definitely not classic Spanish fare... definitely more Continental.", "Date": "Apr 19, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR181271645", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "TravelAdviceCA"}, {"Content": "too far out! my husband and i stayed at the abba gardens hotel oct 2005 for 4 days. the hotel is quite new and modern and very nice you can not fault the actual hotel at all. our hotel room was really nice and we had a long balcony (not all rooms have this)we did not request this and did not pay any extra we must have been lucky! the brekfast was good enough to set you up for the day, we did not use the resturant in the evening as it looked a bit pricey and also you need to dine out in the evening as there is some good resturants in the city centre. the hotel bar was nice and plesant to enjoy a drink after a hard day sightseeing also if you walk back from the nearest metro you may possibly need one! to say the least it is a steep hill to walk up on the way back! this was by far a massive negative point the location is not great! we also read reviews about the location and did not think this would be a problem as we are fit and still young (ish) but it was after walking it a few times it put a downer on the holiday and it was hard to hail a cab when we got off the metro. so we got cabs to the city centre in the end.(the walk from the nearest metro is not too bad it is the hill that gets you and when you have been walking around all day this is not a great end to the day as you may(as we did) then want to go out in the evening and have to do it again) if you are travelling with an other couple the taxis will work out better than if you are just the two of you..... having said all that the hotel is very good value for money and the pool area looked really nice, we did not use it as it was not warm enough but i would say it was very nice indeed......so if you dont mind the extra walking...or having to pay for taxis....this is a nice modern hotel...that is a bit far out of the city centre.", "Date": "Apr 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR368926160", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "GETawayPEOPLE"}, {"Content": "Great hotel, just not central This hotel was very nice, large rooms and good service from helpful and friendly staff.Just one word of warning - make sure you have the full address of the hotel written down for cab drivers, as it is very new and my driver didn't recognise the name.

The hotel itself is modern and functional appealing to both business users and families/couples etc. The rooms are very spacious, each with their own seperate corridors (once inside the main door) to increase one's privacy. The bathroom is well laid out with plenty of surface space for all your belongings. Some rooms come with their own small balconies which offer a nice view out onto the pool area.The pool itself is a good size and ideal for swimming lengths or simply just for children to play in. If you are thinking about doing a lot of swimming, I would definitely recommend bringing goggles as there was a lot of chlorine in the water. There were always plenty of sun loungers available and it never felt too crowded. The pool bar/restaurant was a bit disappointing and the standard of food and promptness of service was not great. I did not think that the selection of food was good value for money, and for that reason alone, ate out a lot or brought lunch back to the hotel. Apart from this however, there were many other excellent aspects to this hotel. The attitude and friendliness of the staff was excellent and they all spoke a good level of English. The hotel also offers a free minibus service into the nearest town shopping district on Avenida Diaganol which can save you 5 euros. If you want to go into the main centre of Barcelona i.e Las Ramblas and Plaza Catalunya, the hotel will organise a taxi for you which costs roughly 10-12 euros one way. One piece of advice when getting a taxi back to the hotel - Tell the taxi driver it is near Hospital de San Joan de deu. As it is a relatively new hotel, a lot of taxi drivers hadn't heard of it. Overall I felt like I was really on holiday when I stayed at Abba Gardens. It was slightly out of the all hussle and bussle which was nice and relaxing, and yet only a quick taxi ride in for all those shopping trips and much awaited nights out.

The bar was expensive but because of the easy bus route back we ate out centrally and returned later so it didn't make alot of difference.", "Date": "Jun 10, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR436701387", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "VivienneQ"}, {"Content": "Excellent hotel, in the middle of nowhere We loved the hotel itself. The room was bigger than we imagined, clean, and equipped with everything we needed (like refrigerator and safe). The hotel is very nice, the service is good, the buffet breakfast was huge, and the dinner in the restaurant, though very expensive, was exquisite and romantic.But, the location of the hotel is really bad. It's on a top of a hill in a residential area with a school and hospital, but nothing, and I repeat, NOTHING, to do nearby. The nearest metro is 15 minutes walk away, and the return walk uphill is very difficult, so you'll find yourself using cabs just to return from the metro to the hotel. It will take you a few days to figure out where in the 20 minute walk radius you can even find something to eat; In the first day, we walked around for more than an hour searching for a grocery store, restaurant, or something. In the next few days we learned that there is an expensive restaurant 2 minutes away (but it is opened only in very specific hours) and a cluster of cheap restaurants 20 minutes away, but that is all. For anything else, including a grocery store, you'll need to take the metro, and take the difficult hike uphill (or a cab) back from it, something that can easily take an hour.But, if you intend to only exit and return to the hotel once a day, and have good legs, you might want to consider the Abba Gardens anyway, if you can get it for a good price.", "Date": "Jun 1, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR559823674", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Nice hotel but I stayed at the Abba Garden in May 2004. The staff are very friendly speak very good english and rooms are very clean. Unfortunatley the positioning of the Hotel is very bad it is not near any tourist areas and in order to access these you need you travel by Metro or get a bus which in both cases you need you walk for about 15 minutes. The catering facilities are not brilliant each night there is a set menu with not alot of variety. Drinks at the bar are very expensive we were charged twelve euro for a measure of whiskey, unfortunately there are not even any bars nearby again you would need to travel by Metro or bus.

Lovely hotel, friendly staff, clean and tidy rooms everything you'd expect from a four star hotel - only don't make the same mistake we did, getting the street name mixed up with another street which is more central in Barcelona. However this hotel is easy to find and has great transport links, there is a bus stop at the bottom of the hill -numbers 78 and 63 then night bus 12, or a short walk away is the Metro station Line 3 - Zona Universitaria. The Hotel is located near a hospital - Sant Joan de Deu - don't worry though you won't hear any ambulance sirens.

It's a brand new hotel so lovely and clean, nice decor etc.The room I got was MASSIVE. It had an internal hallway it was so big. The bathroom was huge and had a double sink which is always great. Breakfast was lovely, they had fruit, cold meats, cheeses, pastries, cereal you name it. We ate it.Staff were more than willing to help with tourist questions and were lovely to us the whole time.The only bummer was the pool wasn't yet opened, but it should be now. They have a gym with spa and sauna as well which we didn't use, but it looked good.The other slight downside was it was about a 20 min walk to the Metro stop and another 15 mins on the train to the Las Ramblas. This wasn't that bad as the hotel was so impeccable. If you want to be close to everything then this may not be your place, but if you don't mind a walk (it's actually quite a nice walk and you can go through a park on the way) then it's worth it to have such a nice place to stay.", "Date": "Aug 18, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR563570578", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "melza"}, {"Content": "\u9289\u6129\u5137\u9288\u6c47\u5139\u9289\u5a47\u5115\u6fb6?#x201d;   showReview(19167859, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR261029352", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Bon hotel mais service moyen   showReview(8492355, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR828573882", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "ThierryLyon"}, {"Content": "Acorde con sus 4 estrellas   showReview(7367981, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR235404807", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "FromGalwayToBilbao"}, {"Content": "F\u7709hle mich hier wohl.   showReview(5470210, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR235593909", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d277226-r18989407-Abba_Garden_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "277226", "Price": "$203"}}
