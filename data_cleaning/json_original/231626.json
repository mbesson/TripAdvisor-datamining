We were 5 guys backpacking for the first time. Didnt know what to expect. Its close to the airport but its also hard to find. We were lucky that we happened to run into it. Pure Luck!!! The neighborhood is safe but a bit scary. You get a feeling that your in the ghetto. The day we arrived we didnt know what to expect, we were open minded about what we would encounter. The hotel itself is super clean and really comfortable. I loved the space and the free porn. The neighborhood itself looks like a ghost town because you see tons of buildings but no one outside. The hotel has a tapas bar next to it and it was cool getting to know the people. People are really cool but look at you kinda funny since it seems like theirs not to many tourist in the area. I loved the fact that I felt like an outsider because I felt like a backpacker and was able to meet the real people of madrid. Once you go into the city its very metropolitan. To sum it all up. I would recommend this hostel to people that are adventurous and backpackers. I would not recomend it for families. Negatives are; Hotel staff are rarely their. If you have to check in make sure you do it from 8:00 to 5:00 because after, its really hard to find the hotel where they leave your keys.", "Date": "September 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cNot a nice surprise\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2480128", "Content": "VERY close to the airport. NOT 5 minutes away (walking) from any train station, more like 30 mins. Reception was closed when we arrived. We let our taxi leave not knowing that we needed a ride to the hotel where the keys had been left. The Pegaso staff couldn't leave the keys at a nearby establishment??? ... or notify us in advance that this would be the case if we arrived after 5pm??? Elevator only goes up to 3rd floor.
