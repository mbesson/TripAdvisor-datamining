My room was upstairs on the 3rd floor, I never knew damp could climb so high. On suite bathroom was a 1970's plastic lined cabin, no hot water at all in shower and toilet worked when it wanted to. The sink was disgusting and the smell was absolutely shocking. As for the carpet, I was scared to walk on it without shoes on. Wallpaper was coming away from walls and curtains looked like they were ready to fall down. Sockets were well doggy with cracked casing and faulty switches. My collegue and I returned at 11:30 after having a meal out, to be met by the hotel in darkness with no lights on the stairs. Other guests were walking around trying to find staff but it appeared none were present in the hotel. This place is really the worst hotel that either my collegue or I have stayed at...how this place passes inspection I do not know as any self respecting inspector would shut them down immediately.....avoid like the plauge !", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cUnbelievably Bad\u201d", "Author": "PickleJim", "ReviewID": "UR43137886", "Content": "we weren't sure about booking after seeing the previous reviews, but since they said they had redecorated we took a chance.

It stank of smoke and there was an ash tray in the room. The worst of all was that it was disgusting. It did not look as if it had been cleaned in months. There were broken electrical sockets that were showing live wires. There was an oil filled heater in the room but the power to it was turned off. The carpets were so dirty we could only walk on them in our shoes. We arrived at 9.45pm and when we went back to the front desk on complain it was closed and the whole of the downstairs area was in darkness. We slept in our clothes on top of the bed. We had to be at the Hospital at 7.30am the next morning, there was still no one about at that time. We had to stay two nights and it was the worst hotel I have ever seen.
