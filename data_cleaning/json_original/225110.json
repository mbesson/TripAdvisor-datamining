When we had gotten halfway home to Central Texas, we received a phone call from the motel telling us that they had found our laptop. Instead of the cleaning crew stealing the laptop (who would know?), they took it to the motel desk where the manager went to the trouble to call us, packed up the laptop with lots of packing material, and was kind enough to mail it FedEx.

After leaving the Ramada after one day AAA booked us easily into this Comfort Inn and from the beginning it was heaven (Or pretty darn close). The staff was extemely nice and very sympathetic to our experience at the other hotel and went above and beyond to ensure we enjoyed our stay with them (they succeeded). The room was very clean and bug free (read my review about the Ramda and you will understand why I say that). The front desk was very helpful with tips on shows and things to do in Branson (great location off the strip btw) and the on site gift shop was a great convienence we were not expecting. We are returning to Branson in July of this year and if it was not for the fact our money is very tight, we would be staying here again. But believe me if we have any problems with our other hotel I would not hesitate to stay here again, no matter what the cost. Thanks to the Staff at this Comfort Inn for our great stay and I am happy to read (according to the current reviews) that this hotel has kept up it's high standards of service and cleanliness.

Our room had a king bed with a recliner. Wonderful. Other room had 2 queens. Both rooms were exceptionally clean and comfortable. A/C blower runs constantly with compressor only kicking on when needed--so you don't hear the blower cycling on and off all night. King room had one sink with big mirror and long table. Queen room had 2 sinks--one outside the bath area and one inside the bath, stool, and tub area. Flat screen TV's, microwaves, fridges, iron and ironing boards. You can even make your own coffee in your room. Bath even had a heat lamp which is great for cold weather. Only complaint is that the Golf Channel was not on the TV lineup. The breakfast area is fairly large with many tables and chairs. Great breakfast--hot and cold items. Scrambled eggs, sausage links, biscuits and sausage gravy, either blueberry or maple pancakes, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, 3 kinds of cold cereal, bagels, cream cheese, many types of donuts, toast and jelly, peanut butter, 3 types of juices, and very good coffee. The attendant kept the items well stocked. Didn't use the pool facility but looked great with the pool, hot tub, and sauna. Used the treadmill in the fitness room. Are 3 other items that can be used. Has a real nice gift shop and you are given a coupon for a discount for items bought there. Very friendly staff. The only complaints that I have are: 1) the hotel has four floors but only one elevator. Not good when completely booked; 2) the computer is next to the check-in desk on a table with the screen facing the lobby area. Had to stand up. Would be nice to have it on a desk with a chair to sit on. Maybe this is the hotel's way of keeping computer time to a minimum. This hotel has a great location. On the Shepherd of the Hills Expressway on the north side of town (red route). The Sight and Sound Theater can be seen only about 4-5 blocks away. Is very easy and quick to get to any area of town.

Note about Branson: I have been going to Branson since I was a kid (30+ years). Branson hit a peak about 10 years ago and has been going downhill ever since. The hotels and restaurants on the strip should overall be avoided. I suggest staying and dining away from main road (HY 76). Many on the restaurants on the strip need to be shut down by the health department (no joke - read the reviews of the Plantation and Baldnobber\u2019s restaurants).

Pool starts at 3 ft so kids can be trained, sauna is good but gets crowded at some times and then there is no place to get in. But it is very clean with very good daily maintenance and open till midnight. i had read reviews on tripadvisor so has already asked the front desk to shut the motion sensor off for a/c also we didnt need the cooling so much as it was really cool. breakfast was good and for a vegetarian I could have the fresh fruits and yogurt. there are a number of different types of donuts which i had never seen before for breakfast so if you love coffee and donuts you are hooked :). The lady at the breakfast counter is very efficient for her age and does a great job The location is great, not noisy but accsesibl eto other areas of attractions also Kmart is close as i had forgotten to pack a number of things. cleaning staff is very well trained. room had a fridge micro and a coffee machine. The room has two sinks one outside and inside a must for people with kids. they do book show tickets for you but we dinnt need it. Shopping is so close by we did a lot at tangers outlet do make a trip. could work on- We checked in around 3:30 pm and had an infant in my arm. we entered the lobby and had to wait at the front desk for a couple of minutes, i waited to see if any of the person asks us to check in so was not impressed with that. Also front desk lady could have been more friendly. However the next day there was a man and another younger girl who were very friendly and nice so i guess it depended on whom you met at your first day. they also asked us how our stay was etc when we checked out. Coffee !! i have never had such diluted coffee before i dont know if it is my taste but really i brewed myself a cup at the room and again a dilute taste i really didnt like that only the breakfast coffee was OK. The internet was really very very slow so dont expect to work from here. There is that musty smell in the room which can be fixed with a dehumidifier but we didnt ask for one just turned the fan on high. Also there are annoying signs all over the place about towel counts, ac use, reusing towels, etc etc very weird for a hotel. Towels are very thin so you may want to carry your own to the pool. overall we enjoyed the hot tub and pool and may will visit again if we can.", "Date": "August 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winchester, VA", "Title": "\u201cA Pleasant Place But One Serious Goofup!\u201d", "Author": "ExArmyRN", "ReviewID": "UR36855659", "Content": "The hotel is in a nice location, away from the busy areas of the city, but with quick access to all the main attractions on the strip (Highway 76).

The only computer available for public use is in the lobby in front of and off to the side of the checkin/checkout area.

The service actually wasn't bad overall but there was one serious mistake--the housekeeper did not properly close the door to our room after cleaning it.

This is our last day of three at Branson, and we feel very fortunate that we chose Comfort Inn and Suites on Gretna Rd. for our hotel. It is further away from Silver Dollar City (a beautiful park with pristine grounds and the friendliest workers) than a few others; but, all roads are easily traveled in Branson, as we never got lost once, and were never stuck in a traffic jam. We could breeze right to Branson's Landing (highly recommended) and travel swifly to the main drag (although quite an eye-sore in our opinion). I would be remiss if I forgot to thank \"Miss Pat\" in the hotel's gift shop, as she color coded all trip routes for us on the Branson map...this was a definite Godsend. We purchased our tickets to SDC from her as well (buy one day get the 2nd free) and also our tickets to Ripley's (one of the better Ripley's around...although quite pricey!). The hotel itself sits on top of a hill, and has quite a grand appearance as you pull into the parking lot. It certainly has the feeling of a western lodge, both inside and out. During our entire stay, all workers have been genuinely kind, considerate, industrious and helpful. This is so hard to find...but we found it here! I'm a \"clean-freak\", always wiping down the walls, the handles, the floors, the everything...and not a single bit of dirt or debris was to be found in our room. That's simply astounding! Even more amazing is that we paid only $98.00/night for our room (we found a coupon in one of the Branson attraction magazines for a minimal discount). This just added to our delight with the hotel and our overall experience. The breakfast room has plenty of space; although, we almost had to eat out in the lobby at one point and time, but that would have been fine (it's gorgeous and accommodating). There are many food choices, such as scrambled eggs, biscuits and sausage gravy, oatmeal (with brown sugar added if you wish), an assortment of donuts, bagels, cereals, etc. There's also coffee (decaf and regular), juices, skim milk and 2%. I can't imagine a person wanting (or expecting) anything more than this. The lady who runs the breakfast room is quite exemplary...like a little hummingbird busily keeping all items stocked, trash emptied, and counters wiped. On our final night, we ordered pizza from Luigi's (there are 3 in Branson) at the recommendation of the hotel receptionist. The pizza arrived at our room in less than 35 minutes! Impressive! We ordered garlic cheese bread (soft and gooey...yet a light crisp crusp...mmmm!), a small special and a medium canadian bacon and mushroom, for a grand total of $26.75. The pizza was among the best we have ever eaten. The size of the pizza was more than generous for the 3 of us, and we had plenty left over. Tremendous! We are headed down to table rock lake now for 5 days...a perfect continuation of our trip.", "Date": "June 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "louisiana", "Title": "\u201cLooking forward to next time!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "angin", "ReviewID": "UR31291297", "Content": "We stayed here from May 26-May 30.

The location is on the North side of Branson, which is quiet but very convenient to everything in Branson. It is especially close to all of the outlet malls. The breakfast was very good, and the area was kept clean and all food replenished as needed. We were able to find a table both mornings, so crowding wasn't a problem on this visit. There were lots of seats out by the pool and also in the lobby if needed. The lady working the breakfast room was so nice and pleasant. We visited with her, and she mentioned what a great place this was to work. It was obvious by the way we were treated that people who work at this hotel like their jobs and are proud of the hotel. Everyone was very friendly, from the people planting flowers outside, to the housekeeping lady we met in the hallway. This is not a fancy hotel, but the beds were very comfortable with lots of pillows. The little gift shop was a nice little extra, and ice and vending machines were easily available.

The wireless internet was easy to access. I agree with a previous post that mentioned that there are too many signs in the room, and I also don't like to be told which towels to use! The free breakfast offering was good. It consisted of three types of cereal (raisin bran, corn flakes and froot loops), milk, yogurt, fruit (bananas and apples), mini bagels, a variety of doughnuts, biscuits and gravy and scrambled eggs. There was also bread you could toast and assorted condiments. The juices offered were orange, cranberry and apple. There was plenty of quantity and selection and the dining and food service areas were kept clean and restocked although it was quite busy. The dining area overlooks the indoor pool. The heated indoor pool was quite nice and was clean. The hot tub was nice also. There are towels provided in the pool area.

It's off the beaten path but the excellent service is worth the extra drive to attractions and shows. We've been coming to Branson for the past 10 years. We usually stay at another hotel property but their service and cleanliness has gone downhill. I looked on TripAdvisor and saw the reviews and kept calling the hotel until they had a cancellation for us to book our tip with them. The reviews are true!! We were very pleasantly surprised at the friendliness! ALL the staff is friendly and the best thing we loved is that the breakfast room is only supposed to be open until 9:30am. We didn't make it down until 10:00am and everything was still open!! They didn't push anybody to rush down as do some hotels with their breakfasts. You either get there on time or you're out of luck. Not so with this hotel. We will definately come back again!! One suggestion, how about a frequent visitor card so free stays can be accumulated.

Free breakfast was excellent with make your own waffles and good variety of pastry items to please the family (why spend $6-8 per person for warmed over buffet food and have to drive somewhere else?). Great gift shop with genuinely discounted merchandise, not the phoney \"80% off\" you see at the area outlet shops. Only hiccup of the whole stay was missed linen service one day (we were napping with \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on door) It should have been rescheduled by the attendant.

There is also a very nice exercise room as well as an arcade/activity room. The complimentary breakfast has more than some offer.

Everytime you would walk through the lobby area they would always speak to us. The hotel is very, very, very clean. I am extremly picking and it was up to my standards. Everything appeared spotless and tidy. The pool area was large for an indoor area. Maintance crew members were always around in case something needed fixed or cleaned up. THe breakfast was very simple. but adequete. It served the purpose. There was always plenty of foof to go around. As far as the location, it was hidden away from the road a bit so it was less noisy than the stuff on the strip. It was only a short drive to attractions. There is nothing really in walking distance because of busy roads. This hotel is extremly well maintained and they have a wonderful management staff.

That was over 50years ago. I'm sorry to say that the excessive commercial development of the area has ruined some fond memories of a lovely and peaceful village in the Ozarks. It's interesting that the locals have chosen to call the main entertainment road \"the strip.\" Indeed, the hills look like casualties to strip mining. We feared the Comfort Inn and Suites in Branson Meadows would be another disappointment. We read a recent review in TripAdvisor from a contributor from WI. The review was quite negative. Well, the writer must have been staying somewhere else, because we found this Inn to be outstanding and none of their complaints were obvious during our stay. The whole property was \"clean as a pin\" and had the feel of a high quality Country Lodge. The indoor pool was very nice, the breakfast area was spacious and well supplied. But the big plus was the staff. These people from the front desk to housekeeping all went above and beyond the norm to make us feel at home and meet all of our requests. Having been an investor in the hospitality industry before my retirement 2 years ago, I can spot enlightened ownership that puts an emphasis on staff training. This is a well trained group.

We decided to stay at this hotel based on previous reviews on this site and also information provided on their website. We ended up getting a room with a king bed and hot tub for 2. Check in was fast and efficient. The gal behind the counter was very friendly and she was some sort of manager also. The room was a good size with plenty of room to move around. The hot tub is in the room and not the bathroom. We were very pleased with the room. Everything was seemed new and clean. No worn bedding, no marks on the walls, no worn down furniture. Also the hallways and exterior of the building was well maintained. We were totally comfortable in our room. The hotel also offers a deluxe continental breakfast but I cannot comment on that as we never went down to eat in the mornings. The hotel is away from the main drag but still close enough to all the theaters and shops. The pool water was at a good temperature. The only thing is pool towels were a little ragged and thin. But overall I would recommend this hotel to all travelers. I don't think you will be disappointed. Also this hotel recently became an all non smoking hotel.
