I stayed at the Hotel Muguet. They did something for me right away that showed a nice touch. I am a large man, and I had a very large suitcase with a carry-on with me. I had rented a small room because I wanted to save money, but when I came in they simply offered to upgrade my room to the largest they had for very little more money per night. I stayed one night in the small room, and then two nights in the largest room when it opened up. The difference in cost was minimal - they discounted the big room for me. The bathrooms in the small rooms are very small. They are uncomfortable for large people. In contrast, the room and bathroom in the big rooms are very large. In the big room, there was a large, deep bathtub that was great for soaking. After long walks in Paris, to soak in a hot tub up to the neck was a wonderful feature. Also, the rooms are very clean, and have a nice modern look. They feature AC and cable TV. There are some English channels and American CNN on the cable. You have a lot of privacy in the hotel - there doesn't seem to be much noise that travels through the hotel, and since the hotel is on a side street and not one of the main avenues, street noise is hardly there. Another great feature was the breakfast. It was a cross between a continental and a cooked breakfast. It was \"Parisian.\" There were lots of French breads and pastries and croissants, and fruit, hot and cold cereals, breakfast meats, cheeses, and boiled eggs. But here is where the cooked part comes in - they will make an omlette to your order if you so choose. The furnishings are modern and not overly fancy at the hotel, but I like modern sometimes. Another nice touch - I speak English and not French, and though I picked some French up and tried speaking some French phrases, the staff was patient with my French and would help me with it if I had a quick question. The hotel is right downtown in the Eiffel Tower district. You can walk to the Eiffel Tower in 5 minutes, and Napoleon's tomb with the military museum and veterans hotel (Palace d' Invalades) are one block away. There are two metros one block away, which take you all over the city to the major attractions. There are tons of nice cafes right around the hotel, and a special treat is a small neighborhood called the Rue Cler that is right around the corner.

Looked to reviews for hotel to stay at in Paris and the reviews are pretty accurate. The location is great, close to Metro, Invalides, & Effiel Tower. I would have given this a \"Very Good\" rating however: The rooms are a normal size for Paris, a \"queen\" bed (after 2 nights realized it was essentially 2 twin beds pushed together because we could feel the seams) and a large ottoman chair, desk and 2 amiors fit into the room. My husband and I are used to plush pillow tops mattresses, however we have slept on hard mattresses and by our account our room's mattress was HARD (as in absolutly no padding/cusioning to support our backs), after a few nights our backs were sore from sleeping on the bed. Also, it should be noted, and I am not sure why no one else posted it in their review, but you are required to leave your room key at the front desk when you leave at any time (we were not sure if this was \"normal\" Paris standards). We thought this was a bit odd because the hotel has a large sign posted that they do not assume responsibility for any stolen or missing items from the room and it is suggested that you lock your valuable items up (no brainer for that one) but it would clearly not fit a laptop or anything large. There is a small safe provided in the room but it cannot fit a laptop or ipad. We also ran into a misunderstanding when we first arrived, we were told by the lady at the front desk that the free breakfast was from 06:30 until 10:30. We went to breakfast the next morning, we saw a sign-in sheet where the eggs are ordered and asked the waitress working there about the breakfast and if it was free and she also said it was HOWEVER, the same evening when we picked up our key for our room the gentleman working the front desk asked us if we had breakfast (which we had) and he said that it was not free (the cost was 12 euros per person). We explained to him that 2 people had told us it was free but he assured us that we had heard wrong, we could tell there was no way he was going to be budging with taking it off of our tab (it seemed that there was NO way that his staff was wrong or misinformed us).

The hotel is modern and has a very nice lobby with plenty of sitting space to wait and read. There is a small elevator that will take you to your floor or you may take the winding staircase if you wish. We had a room on an upper floor with a view of the Eiffel Tower. That view also allows you to see the street below. Having stayed on Rue Cler before, the street noise here was limited and the view was wonderful. Our room was spotless upon arrival and the bathroom was spacious with a shower/tub combo and a small sitting area with the room. The bed was wonderful and slept well. There is a phone in the room and a television with multiple language channels. Our room also had plenty of closet space for two people, with two separate closets. The breakfast area is somewhat tight in space, but the closeness creates an opportunity to meet some new friends, share ideas, and get some very helpful information for sightseeing. The breakfast itself is wonderful with a wide variety of items to choose from, including a made to order omelet. The bread is fresh and the croissants will melt in your mouth. You couldn\u2019t do better. There is a great variety of meat and cheese, juices, rolls and yogurts. At checkout, the staff went out of their way to get us transportation to the airport and it was on time and priced right. We will stay here again on our next visit.

We shop at the little boutiques in the neighborhood, hit the local market for groceries, take advantage of the local laundromat, and wrestle with choosing which pattisserie in the neighborhood is best. The rooms at Hotel Muguet are tiny but immacualte with very good, firm beds (dramatically improved since my last visit). Modern bathrooms, small but helpful elevator for access to upper floors with luggage. Very quiet street just a half block off the rather busy Avenue Motte Piquet. Walking distance to la Tour Eiffel, les Invalides and Rodin museum. Many wonderful restaurants in the neighborhood (Cafe Bosquet, Cafe Central, Punjab and Bistro St, Dominique some of our favorites). Breakfast at 12 euros per person is not a bargain, but for us, worth it to save time and get going in the morning, and decent offering of breads, ham, cheese, yogurts, fruit, hard-boiled eggs, cereals. Wonderful service from breakfast staff who always scrambled to help seat our party of 3. You can always pop over to Rue Cler markets, just 2 blocks away, if you want variety or a less expensive alternative. Front desk staff is mostly a little reserved but very helpful; their English is good but not super fluent.

The air conditioning was invaluable as there were three days of heat during my stay (the lobby does not have a/c). The front desk was helpful at all times. As the hotel has been reviewed in detail by others, I will limit my review to topics that have not been covered. The Ecole Militaire Metro stop is more convenient for services such as cafes and groceries, the La Tour Maubourg stop is fine if you wish to go directly to the hotel. The Rue Cler is between the two stops. I personally found the Rue Cler touristy, but convenient. Many businesses are closed Sunday and/or Monday which is common in Paris. Nobody mentioned the bus. There are buses on the Motte Picquet that are very easy to use. The hotel staff looked up the numbers for me. The buses use the same ticket as the metro. I was able to take a bus to Gare du Nord instead of trying to manage luggage in the metro. The metro is wonderful, but it is underground and the buses can be more scenic and direct. Paris is a beautiful city to walk. I walked to the d'Orsay and on to the Left Bank. I also feel the Champs Elysees is doable (others have mentioned the Eiffel Tower). If you need to purchase a museum pass, head over to the Army Museum. You do not need to actually visit the museum to buy the pass. There is a newstand on the Rue Cler. Pick up a copy of The Periscope. It is in French, but it is easy to figure out. It lists what is going on in key theater venues. I went to a piano concert at the Hotel des Invalides and a ballet at a theater off of the Champs Elysees.

I made arrangements for our group of six (which included three generations) to stay here. Everyone was pleased with the decision. I found the beds to be extremely comfortable, and the blackout curtains ensured a sound sleep. The rooms were very well soundproofed. The built-in tile shower stall featured a large showerhead and excellent water pressure. The air-conditioning worked well, and was most welcome after our first two days of hot, sunny weather. One couple opted for the superior room with a view, and were happy with their view of the dome of the Invalides. Others might be disappointed not to be able to seee the Eiffel Tower. The seniors in the group were initially placed in a room on the sixth floor. However, since the elevator only goes to the fifth, it would mean climbing stairs, which they had difficulty with. We asked for a different room, and were able to make the change after the first night. I also had a problem with the in-room safe, and they sent someone up to the room to fix it right away. The guests here were almost exclusively American, and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. There was a problem calling a cab the day of our departure due to a triathalon, but we just walked to the taxi stand near the Tour Maubourg metro stop.

First, the negatives: The bathroom amenities (e.g. soap) were very poor, about the size of a postage stamp (literally). For the price paid, I think the Muguet can do a little better here. On our first morning about 0730 there was a fire alarm....evidently someone set the detection system off by smoking in their room. When we reached the lobby the staff acted like nothing was happening, sitting at the desk working. Finally the owner appeared and announced that everyone could return to their room. To my knowledge the fire department had never been called, nor was their a public address sytem (required by codes) to announce and inform guests what was going on. We asked about a hair dryer and told that there was one in our desk drawer. It literally was wired through the rear of the drawer, and you had to hold the button continuously to operate. I know electric is expensive in Paris, but give me a break! I had great difficulty with the internet/computer in the lobby. On the postive side, the property was very clean, the staff friendly and courteous, and we had a quiet room. The air conditioning worked fine, but only when you were in the room. You must remove your key card when leaving and this shuts all electric off in the room. This is why they collect the key card at the desk when you leave.

As other reviewers have noted, you aren't allowed to eat anything in your room. I think this should be more clearly stated on their website as it's not the case in every hotel in Paris, and they are very strict about this at the hotel. My recommendation to the hotel is that they work on clearly communicating this rule at the arrival of guests. They have several rules at this hotel which are posted in their elevator and behind their concierge desk, but who can keep track of reading all these materials when it is scattered? My advice to the hotel is to type up all the reminders and rules that are important to them one one page to give to guests at their arrival: no food eaten in room, nonsmoking, charge a day's hotel fee if you checkout early by 7am, guests must handover hotel key every time you leave the hotel and the list of their rules go on. To us, it didn't seem classy of the hotel (in fact it was pretty annoying, like being bossed around by mom with post it notes around the house) to post all these reminders everywhere and it was unprofessional to not clearly communicate this at the beginning. In fact, we didn't realize we were supposed to give them the hotel key every time we left the hotel (for security purposes they said), until one day we came back and we were harshly reprimanded by the older man at the desk (wears glasses). Well this rule does not apply at every hotel so we were not aware, we certainly would have done that earlier if we had been advised. That grumpy man at the desk works long hours day and night. Then there is a cheerier more pleasant man (slim, stylish) who sometimes works the night shift. There are also maybe four other younger staff that work throughout the week. When we asked the grumpy older man at the desk if he could arrange a shuttle to the airport for us, he was pretty rude and said they don't call shuttles for guests and we would have to call ourselves! What the heck does a concierge get paid for then??? So we waited for Grumpy Guy to leave and got one of the younger guys to call the shuttle, which took a long time to arrange by phone (25 min) but we were just grateful he did it.

The bathroom, while small, provided an enclosed shower, which was nice given that a lot of French hotels really don't provide this (either no shower, or an attachment on the tub which is not adequately enclosed to prevent water from getting all over the place when you shower). Our party of six (one couple, my two sisters, my nephew, and I) got three rooms--one queen bed and two rooms with twin beds. The beds were very comfortable, and the rooms were well appointed. The air conditioning in our room was not overpowering (my sisters' room was much cooler), but we never really had a day that put it to the test. The location was what we were looking for--close to the metro (Ecole Militaire and La Tour Maubourg about equally close in opposite directions on La Motte Piquet), and in the quiet 7th arrondisement. If you are looking for late night action, or tons of bars and restaurants, you might prefer someplace like the Marais. If you want a quiet neighborhood, but one that is not remote, this is where you want to be. The hotel doesn't want you to take food into the rooms (no minibars here), but you can use the ground floor breakfast area if you buy something on Rue Cler and need a place to sit down and eat it. This hotel also provided the most reliable high speed internet of any of the three hotels we used during our stay in France. I have to give a special thanks to the night clerk from Saturday night.

They had free wi-fi which was wonderful, and elevator so we weren't lugging our bags 3 flights up. There is no continental breakfast, but we ended up eating chocolate croissants from street vendors every morning anyway. Our view was of a courtyard off the street which was nice. The hotel is located in a more well-to-do area and the street it sits on is home to many apartments and condos. I enjoyed not having too much of the city noise at night while we slept. The location isn't far from the Eiffel Tower, and if you're using the metro, everything is within 10-20 minutes anyway. The desk attendants are pleasant enough and if we'd required assistance, they would've tended to us. They weren't overly friendly, but we didn't really encounter much of that on our trip anyway.

First, the staff and particularly the owner, Mme. Richard, and her daughter, are simply delightful. However, there are real problems with the room we stayed in. The room we had faces the street on Rue Chavert. It is a small street but quite noisy at all hours. To get sleep one must close the window to keep out the street noise. The nights were cool outside, but inside the room became incredibly hot. So hot, in fact, that the three of us had a terrible time sleeping! The room was not air conditioned, and I cannot imagine sleeping there in summer months. Also, the shower is doorless but allows water to escape onto the floor requiring us to mop up about a gallon of water after each shower. This was minor however compared to the sleepless nights. Unfortunately, this really affected the quality of our Paris experience. There are a number of positives however that I want to emphasize -- the wonderful staff, the breakfast, location near the metro, the nearby laundrymat, grocery store, and pharmacy. Try to get a room facing the coutyard and you may be able to keep the window open. Get a room on the top floor and it may reduce the noise and no risk of noisy upstairs neighbors -- there were four unescorted kids above us that made a racket well into the a.m. but we cannot blame the staff for that.

Have never been asked to do this before - it's somewhat of a hassle having to ask the receptionist (if they're even there) for my hotel key everytime I need to access my room.

However, I was a little disappointed. What was good: The location of the hotel is great! The cleanliness of the room was very good. What could have been better: I received a very lukewarm reception when I arrived. If you wanted to know anything, do not expect the hotel to be pro-active. You need to make the effort to ask. (Which is a shame, as it should be the other way around; as I'm sure they have a wealth of information to share). As referenced in other reviews the bathroom in my room was TINY! And I mean very, very small. In fact, so much so that the toilet seat nearly touched the door of the shower cubicle. It was a good job the shower doors opened away from you. In fact, there was so little room, that I had to dry myself off in the bedroom. Be aware that the hotel taxi service to CDG (costing 15 Euros) is 'subject to availability' - which is not stated on the promotional material. When I enquired the day before I was due to travel, the service was already full. Due to the above, the hotel kindly booked me a normal taxi to take me to the Roissy Bus stop. Please be aware - the total journey time of only 8 minutes (it was 6am), cost me just over 15 Euros which is super expensive. Sadly, the hotel never advised me how much this short trip would have cost me. At breakfast time, all of the tables were dirty and someone had to clean one for me. Also, no one really took the time to explain to me how the breakfast system worked. Breakfast was 'OK' though and the fresh coffee was very good! The free WIFI didn't work at all on the second day of my stay and I found that when it did work it was very temperamental. When I went downstairs to reception to ask why the WIFI wasn't working, I received a reply of 'it's not working for me too', which I thought was a little unprofessional, as he wasn't a paying guest. So overall, I didn't feel that the hotel really did itself any justice on my visit, which is a shame, as I had read so many good reviews. However, I will only recommend the hotel to my family and friends on the basis of its location and the cleanliness of the room. I suppose, you pay for what you get.

I'm someone who needs coffee ASAP in the morning and can't function without it, so the thought of wandering around Paris looking for a decent cafe to get a coffee was not appealing.

The reception we received when we arrived at the hotel was cool to put it kindly. There were no smiles, there was no warm welcome, and there was a lot of annoyance with questions we asked. Our sons range in age from 19 to 26 and there were 5 of them. Apparently, the hotel does not wish to have young, lively people staying with them. Wish we had known that before we booked.....instead, once we arrived we were told that it was a \"quiet hotel\" and made to feel that talking at normal decibel level was just too loud. Eventually, we felt that we were walking on eggshells and whispering was as loud as we should speak. We couldn't stay together in a room to talk because the people around us told us we were too loud. We couldn't sit in the lobby to talk because - you guessed it - too loud. How do 9 people talk quietly??? (honestly- no one was shouting, but we were not dead....because that would probably have been quiet enough for them....) We were on a family vacation and were not able to hang out together in the hotel as a family. Not that we wanted to have a party - just a few glasses of wine and sharing stories about our day. It was a huge disappointment to be treated as the 'ugly Americans' when we were paying for 4 rooms for two nights. We are used to being treated much better in most hotels (believe me, we are NOT demanding- we tend to be afraid to ask for anything....).

Further, Rue Cler, a restaurant row made famous by Rick Steve\u2019s Paris travel guide, is about three blocks away. There are many other great places to eat in the area as well, plus at least three grocery stores and several bakeries, cafes, and fruit stands located within 3 or 4 blocks or the hotel. (We generally avoided the expensive hotel breakfast, opting instead for a roll from a bakery and some orange juice and fruit from local shops each morning.) Finally, a 10 minute walk gets you to the Eiffel Tower. So the location is very definitely a plus. As for the hotel itself, we would definitely recommend Hotel Muguet. Our room was relatively small, but very clean, well-equipped (including Free WiFi), and quite comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and convenient, and we especially appreciated the excellent lighting over the head of the bed, which allowed for late night reading without disturbing one\u2019s sleeping partner. The staff was always professional, courteous, and, when approached, helpful with tourist questions. Staff members arranged reservations for side trips, and one of the night staff spent quite a bit of his time one evening setting up a WiFi connection on my uncooperative laptop. Paris Shuttle picked us up at the airport, but when they failed to show for the return, hotel staff made numerous phone calls on our behalf and, as time grew short, ultimately ran out and secured a taxi for us.

Even more important, the room was immaculate every day. A small alcove contained a twin bed for our daughter, and she welcomed the bit of privacy it afforded her. The view of the Eiffel Tower from our window was icing on the cake. My parents' standard room also was lovely and reasonable in size. The bathrooms in both rooms were modern and well appointed. What raises this hotel to elite status in our book is the neighborhood...it's pretty much perfect. Central location (two blocks from Ecole Militaire, Champ de Mars, and Invalides), residential neighborhood (quiet at night), easy access to two Metro stations, a short walk to the Seine and the Saint Germain des Pres area, and a half-block over to avenue La Motte Picquet, where you'll find numerous great places to eat and drink. Also from La Motte Picquet you can access one of Paris' great market streets, Rue Cler, not five minutes from the Muguet's front door. Favorites on avenue La Motte Picquet included Pain et Chocolat, a little patisserie where we started nearly every morning with tea and fresh breads and croissants. We ended our sightseeing each day at Home in Paris, a little bar/restaurant just around the corner from the hotel where the cocktails are excellent (who knew you could find a good margarita in Paris?!) and the food was delicious. At the end of the street that intersects with the Place d'Ecole Militaire, you'll find several casual bistros, including the very fun, very laidback Cafe des Officiers. The wait staff is friendly and the crowd is young and happy. The menu is basic bistro fare, but the quality is excellent and the lemon tarts are killer!

Our first several encounters with the desk staff seemed to support that conclusion, but as time went on, we increasingly came to appreciate them. When we checked out and were on our way, our limo driver received a call before we had gone more than a mile - Muguet had found my credit card still in the hotel safe! We returned and were met by the head desk person (Catherine, I think) running to the limo to hand me my card, and urging us to go rather than thank her. I never had to move a muscle and the limo driver barely needed to slow down - good things when you need to drive to Charles DeGaulle airport. The rest has all been covered in the other reviews -clean, tastefully appointed rooms - great location - a quiet neighborhood that was our nightly refuge from a crowded June Paris - even a view of the Eiffel tower, which we had not specifically requested. Also, while the elevator is small, the croissants offered at breakfast were the best we had in Paris. Lastly, there was just that great feeling that we were only a step away from a Paris neighborhood, not cocooned in some sterile hotel that you never need to leave.

Nothing interesting. But very quiet. And when you are jetlagged and want to sleep, that is more important than a view! The Hotel Muguet is located on a quiet side street, but one block away (a 2 minute walk) you will find shops, a small supermarket and restaurants as well as a metro station. We never tried the hotel breakfast because the dining room looked more like a school cafeteria and we preferred to eat outside, at a nearby caf\u00e9. A big plus, when you have luggage, is the hotel elevator. Once, just as we were about to check out, it stopped working for a couple hours and the hotel staff immediately offered to carry our suitcases down for us. That was a nice touch.

Rue Chevert is a very quiet one way street that seemed to have very little auto or pedestrian traffic. As Paris was bustling with energy this time of the year, it was refreshing to have a place to relax a bit away from the teaming masses. The location is also very convenient to the rue Cler pedestrian area - two blocks or so away. This area has all the basics one would need - small restaurants, cheese, chocolate, wine, deli's, bakeries etc. We would most days start our journey from that area - get our provisions for the day and off to explore.

We spent 5 days at this hotel and met many other Americans who also traveled with their families. My teenage daughter thought the beds were a bit hard for her liking, but she survived. Our favorite restaurant (Brasserrie) nearby was called La Source. We ate almost all our late lunches or dinners there as we watched the Parisiens walk by. We also observed the children in the park nearby playing soccer. A salad or special plate at this restaurant would be about 11 euros - 15 euros, not bad for Paris. This restaurant and others were close by the Metro Tour La Marbourg. We never ate the breakfast at Muguet, it was 10 euros pp and didn't look that special to us.

And it is fixed into a drawer. There's a large mirror that you can turn and look into, but it is still awkward.

My sister and I stayed two nights at the Hotel Muguet in the 7th for a change in scenery at the end of a longer stay in Paris and Vienna. Location: This hotel is about 2 min on foot to rue Cler, which we only went to the morning we left to buy cheese (I\u2019d been before) and about 10 min on foot to the Eiffel Tower. I hesitate to recommend this location to first time visitors because I think it is out of the way for \u201ceverything else\u201d (other than the Tower) and I think you can do better in terms of accessibility on the metro and to restaurants that are easy to walk to. Rooms: We had an interesting room set up that I think was meant for a triple. We walked into an anteroom with a sectional sofa meant to be a third bed. Our two twins were comfortable, but the room was a bit cramped with just the two of us in it. The bathroom was good sized and bright though. Cleanliness: This is where things started to go wrong for us. I didn\u2019t think highly of the staff as the bathroom looked as if a landmine hit it after it was cleaned each day \u2013 our belongings on the counters and in the shower were all over the place: floor, trash barrel, not on the counter where we'd left them. No care at all went into keeping our things safe and organized. And the second day there was hair (not mine or my sister's, as we are both blond) in my razor. Ugh. That was enough for me. Breakfast was 13 euro and had the fewest offerings on the trip. I would not return here due to location/accessibility to everything I am in Paris to see and the problem with our bathroom cleaning.

We booked through the hotel's website, and received prompt responses to all our questions, and clear directions from the train station (if travelling from Britain) via the Metro. There were lots of reasonably priced and good quality restaurants nearby, my husband needed a Starbucks and that was within five minutes too! Our kids had a twin room which had ample storage for them (two wardrobes) a clean, modern bathroom, and two twin beds. My husband and I were next door in a queen room, which was equally comfortable though a little less storage space. Either way, the rooms were the right price and size (only 135 Euros per night) and the small courtyard breakfast area was perfect for a quick breakfast before sightseeing.

If you're not a big breakfast eater I'd suggest this as you can save about 6 Euros per person vs. a hotel breakfast and enjoy the walk to Rue Cler. Muguet has spotlessly maintained rooms with up-to-date designer touches in warm luxurious colors. The rooms are excellent, if slightly small, in a typical major city way these days. This hotel does feel like you have a room in a 4*+ hotel but none of the bigger hotel bustle. We had a small Eiffel view which is fun but probably not worth the extra money since the tower is about a mile away as the crow flies. If we had been one room closer to the intersection the Eiffel view may have been slightly better but hard to say since the tower isn't just 1 or 2 blocks away. The 2 - maybe 4 person max lift was a fun ride. We ended up using the spiral staircase most of the time. I would say if there was one area for improvement it might be in front desk attitude. We got scolded one day for walking out without leaving our key. The problem was the front desk person was helping another group check in and didn't make any quick eye contact to acknowledge we could drop our key safely so we took it with us. That led to a scolding when we returned and not much interest in our explanation. The front desk always seemed a little economical with their assistance on directions and questions and slightly annoyed if you wanted it repeated or clarified. Still, all in all, I think they were pretty decent but I prefer a more eager to help-eager to please front desk. That said, not a big deal since our priorities are nicely appointed and meticulously clean rooms.

The hotel is located on quiet residential street. It is also conveniently located near two metro stops (Ecole Militaire and La Tour-Maubourg) and is very close to the Eiffel Tower as well. The rooms are small, but there is plenty of room to throw your luggage around and walk around. Free wifi is offered in each room as well. Ours worked perfectly. The bathroom is the major plus. Looks as though they have been newly renovated. There is a rainfall showerhead that is excellent. The shower doors are a little tricky. There is a method to keeping them closed all the way, and once we learned it, we were able to spare the floor from water. However, if you knocked into the door while showering, the doors would open up a bit again. The towels were nice and huge! Another major plus...the windows opened up! We had a window in the room and in the bathroom. It was nice to get fresh air in both the mornings and the evenings. I would highly recommend the breakfast. They charge for the breakfast (I believe it was 9.50 euros), but it is worth it. You get a large croissant and large slice of a baguette. On top of that, you have your choice of cheese, ham, salami, eggs, cereal, yogurt, applesauce (which was delicious!), orange juice, coffee and hot chocolate. We had breakfast out of the hotel the first day, and realized that the hotel breakfast was much better, and a much better deal. You must leave your key at reception any time you leave. It was a little strange at first, but it ensured we wouldn't lose our key, so we were fine with that! The only complaint I have is that we were not allowed to eat in the room.

If you like a spotless room, then you can't go wrong here. The bedding, linen, towels, carpet and bathroom were immaculate. I believe one of the reasons the room was so pristine is that eating in the room is forbidden, as is smoking and ironing. We both missed being able to bring back a quick bite after a busy day or having a snack in the evening. If you want to iron, you have to make arrangements to do so elsewhere in the hotel. You' ll see from the pictures I am attaching that the room, while attractive, was small and would be better suited for a shorter stay. For example, if one of us was sitting at the desk, the other would have to vault over the bed to get to the bathroom - this gets somewhat tedious after awhile - especially when you're over 60 :-). We should have paid 180 euros per night for a superior room instead of 135 euros for the queen room, but lesson learned. Our quiet room looked out over the courtyard and the windows opened up, both in the bedroom and bathroom - very pleasant to get the fresh air and hear the birds chirping in the morning. The bathroom had a shower - no tub - but there was good pressure and lots of hot water. Included toiletries were shampoo, conditioner, shower cap and tissues. A good make-up mirror attached to the wall in the bathroom was helpful. A hair dryer with a very short cord was attached to a drawer in the desk in the bedroom, making it awkward to stand up, look in the mirror and blow dry your hair but where there's a will, there's a way. The room had lots of closet and storage space but we didn't care for the bed - too hard, and the pillows were small and lumpy. The only English T.V. channels you could get were BBC and CNN but that didn't matter too much to us as we usually were out all day so were too tired to watch much T.V. in the evening. As the cost for the breakfast at the hotel was 9.50 euros per person, we usually picked up some croissants, beignets, etc. at a boulangerie and went to Starbucks on Rue Saint Dominique, total cost of about 7 euros for both of us - quite a savings. You could get coffee at the hotel for 2 euros a cup whenever you wanted it. The staff was always pleasant, courteous and very patient with my garbled French. We did miss being able to get ice although you could get coke, etc. from a machine in the lobby. You also have free access to Internet in the lobby but are restricted to 15 minutes, which to me is fair, so that everyone gets a chance to use it. A policy that we haven't encountered in ages was having to leave your key at Reception every time you went out and claim it when you came back, though I suppose this is good for security. The same card that was used as the key had to be inserted into a slot in the room to enable the lights to work. The hotel itself was in an excellent, safe location, close to the Rue Cler, the Eiffel Tower and many cafes and boulangeries. La Tour Maubourg Metro was at the end of the street so we were able to get around everywhere we wanted to go, either by the Metro (and transferring) or walking. Its about an hour or so walk to the Louvre from this hotel if you want a little exercise to help wear off the calories from those delicious French pastries. For something a little different, after you've looked at many of the museums, monuments and attractions, take the metro out to see the Grande Arche de la Defense, which is the last stop west on the No. 1. We were astonished to see the high rise buildings in this area, some quite spectacular in design - modern Paris that you never see in the guide books. There's a Hilton Hotel steps from the Metro at the Grande Arche, and a shopping mall across the street, so a person could tour traditional Paris in the daytime but sleep in modern Paris at night.

The property is immaculate, comfortable and cozy. Our room was small, but we were there mostly to sleep anyway. When we pulled out the chair to the desk to use our laptop, the other had to walk across the beds to get to the bathroom. The room was well appointed and decorated. There were plentiful extra linens, blankets and pillows. Our mattresses were very comforatble. The bathroom was spotless and modern with a heavy soundproofed sliding door to help keep from disturbing light sleepers. The hotel is within easy walking distance to Rue Cler, major tourist sites and two Metro stops. If you're driving an Avis car, there is an office within 2 easy blocks and 2 gas stations nearby to refuel your tank. There are plenty of cafes, bistros, brasseries, and restaurants nearby. A convenient laundromat is at the far end of Rue Chevert. There are plenty of grocery stores and bakeries for snacks and drinks. Two of the mornings one of us went down for coffee to bring back up to the room for 2 euros per cup. The last day we had the breakfast for 9.5 euros and it was well worth it. It included the usual bread basket (croissant, chocolate croissant, part of a baguette), and self-service yogurt, boiled eggs, cereal, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, milk, sliced ham & salami, jams, cheeses and more. You can request a cooked to order omlette (plain, cheese, ham) that's ready in minutes. We loved it and felt it was a great value. We had giggles about the ladies at the front desk.

It looks impeccable from the outside, the entrance hall is impeccably furnished, the staff are impeccably dressed and your room will be as spotlessly clean as other visitors have commented. The rooms are adequately sized by European standards and the majority look out over a calm, light, airy courtyard.

The choice includes ham, cheese, yoghurt, fruit and eggs as well as the traditional bread, croissant and jam and the hotel will prepare an omelette on demand. The price is only 2 euros more than we have paid for a similar quality breakfast in the French provinces and we consider it good quality and value for Paris. The only negative consideration about this hotel would be if you had an aversion to lifts (elevators) and steep stairs. The lift is modern and big enough for 2 people but the stairs are quite steep and they curve. They are very well lit with banister rails and we had no problem with them but I could imagine that someone with a fear of descending steep stairs might find them intimidating.

Flat screen TV, large mirror, and desk. I would wake each day well rested and since the weather was cold while we were there, the heater was always on, which works very well. It is a very cosy place to stay and rest after a day of sightseeing. Hotel rooms and bathrooms: My room: Queen Size bed. Our room had 2 double windows and a larger bathroom because it had a tub with overhead shower. My parents room: Queen Size bed. The room had 1 double window, but their bathroom had another window. There was only a standing shower. Advice - if you want a larger shower area, request a room with a tub. Hotel staff: they are decent, but not the most forthcoming in helping with directions. Wish they were more friendly. Hotel food: We did not eat there. Pricey for what it is for 9 Euros. The breakfast was a little fruit, yogurt, cereals, hard boiled egg and omelet if requested. I recommend eating at Cafe Central on Rue Cler - delicious Nicoise Salad and foie gras... Location: The hotel on Rue Chevert is not easy to find the first time. From the Metro 8 line, when you exit at Ecole Militaire station, take a right. You will pass Rue Cler on the left side (great street with many restaurants and outdoor market). Cross the street to your right side. You will come up on Rue Boullagerie ( spelling?) make a right down this little street and you will dead end into Rue Chevert. Make a left and you will see Muguet right in front. Eiffel Tower is within walking distance, but can be a bit confusing.

We really liked how close to the metro station and to the Rue Cler it is. - Furnishings were nice and the look of the hotel was very tidy and clean.

They were kind of hard and small but my husband didn't mind them. - The bathroom was very tiny and as such it was difficult to move around in there.

The rooms are very nicely decorated, exceptionally clean and for the most part quiet. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel we decided we love the little bakery around the corner and were frequent visitors (Chocolate Amande...awesome!). The beds in the room are very hard for my taste (I am used to a soft pillow top). It was also very warm while we were there and really were glad to be able to open the windows for some fresh air. Yes the room was small but we were expecting that. For those of you that want an idea think a little bigger then your balcony room on a cruise ship. The bathroom was decent size and no complaints there. There is a hairdryer in the desk drawer and yes can be a little awkward as you really can't move far with it, it is fastened to the drawer but definitely good that I didn't have to pack my own. The bathroom was very nice and exceptionally clean. The shower was fantastic, love the rainfall shower or the option to use the hand held shower head. Our shower did tend to leak though on each of the corners but nothing a towel couldn't fix. The towels are wonderful and big you can wrap yourself up in one with plenty of fabric to spare. There is a towel warmer that is a wonderful touch dries the towels fast and nice to get out to a warm towel. Some downsides to the hotel.

On our last day there my face wash also went missing from the shower. They clean so well that I thought it may have been mixed in with the towels or accidentally thrown away. I immediately went down to the front desk and explained that I didn't think anyone took it but that it could have gotten mixed up. The lady at the desk at the time kept thinking that I was saying that the chamber maid stole it. There is a little sweet elderly woman that is at the hotel from time to time she helped me look everywhere including digging through the garbage on the street and downstairs in the towels and it never turned up, makes me wonder.

They were so stealthy in cleaning the rooms! Our rooms were cozy but quite large by Paris standards, I am certain. I could go on and on.

Also a very short walk from the Eiffel Tower, believe there are some rooms which have views of the Tower. Our room, although small, was beautifully decorated, and had plenty of closet space. The bathroom was large enough in size and it was obvious that it had been recently renovated, as had our room. We ate breakfast there 3 out of the 5 mornings, and actually found it better value than going to Rue Cler, if you consider that you not only get your pastries and bread, confiture and butter, you get yoghurt, cereal, meats, Cheeses, Juice and of course coffee, and can go back for seconds, as it is served buffet style. It is possible to use their iron, between certain hours, and there is internet in the foyer for 2 euros per half hour. Think there is 2 English speaking TV channels. Now, our only negative observation was the reception, we arrived on the Friday night, and right through the weekend, the reception was far from enthusiastic, in fact it was decidely cool.

Some aspects of this review are biased to those with a similarly aged child since I would have been grateful for this sort of information before our trip. Apologies in advance if this is not relevant to you. I found this hotel on TripAdvisor and it does live up to expectations set by the reviews here and by its classy website. We were originally going for a hotel in the 90-100 Euro range but couldn't book the one we wanted (even in December). The Hotel Muguet was the next one in the overall ratings for Paris (#24) although it was a bit more expensive at 130 Euros per night. With hindsight, it was a very good decision and well worth the extra 150 Euros in total - I've already forgotten the extra cost but the memories of the trip will last a lifetime. The Hotel Muguet is classy, clean, cosy and comfortable with very friendly staff. We ended up in room 36 which I think is normally a triple room but we only paid the 130 Euro rate. I think we got it because of needing space for a cot for our son. That might not happen in high season but it was most welcome. The bed was huge and the room very large too. There was plenty of room for us, our luggage, the cot and our pram. The bathroom was also a decent size too - not palatial but bigger than I had expected based on reviews of most Paris hotels. There are places to have breakfast in Rue Cler (1 minute walk away) for 6-8 Euros but we chose to have breakfast in the hotel (9.5 Euros). It has a very pleasant dining area with extremely friendly baby-loving staff. We found it was a nice relaxing start to the day and we appreciated not having to rush out to have breakfast. Our son had juice and some bread and yoghurt each morning but we were not charged for his breakfast. One word of caution though - there were no baby chairs in the dining area. The chairs wrap around so they were fine for our 2 year old but I'd check with the hotel in advance if you're taking a younger child. In fact, we found baby chairs elusive throughout Paris - except in McDonald's ! We got a taxi from (Monday evening) and to (Saturday morning) the Eurostar at Gare du Nord and both trips cost 14 Euros which we thought was very good value for money. Definitely recommended over hauling the pram and luggage though the metro system. There were no child seats in the taxis but the drivers didn't drive fast so we didn't feel it was a huge risk. Not ideal but I'd do it again. We would highly recommend using the excellent and underrated bus network. We tried one trip on the metro and that was enough - no lifts and very crowded, so no fun with a pram. The buses are very frequent (every 10 minutes or less), each bus stop provides lots of route information and a live system indicating how long the next bus will be and, best of all, each bus has double doors which are great for prams and there is a large dedicated space inside for prams. Get yourself one of the RATP daily or weekly passes. There are several bus stops within a 2 minute walk of the hotel serving several useful bus routes. One goes all the way to Montmartre (past the bottom of the Champs Elys\u00e9e), another right past the Arc de Triomphe (at the top of the Champs Elys\u00e9e) (great fun in a bus with all the traffic converging !) and another all the way along the Left Bank past St.Germain des Pr\u00e9s. In addition, you can get just about anywhere with one or two easy connections. You also get a good view of the city while you're travelling and you meet lots of friendly Parisians who seem to love making faces at babies. The neighbourhood around the hotel seems very safe. Since we were there in December, we were often walking to and from the bus stops, Rue Cler (restaurants, supermarkets) and the Eiffel Tower after dark and we always felt very comfortable and secure.

Of all the places we stayed, we liked this the least! The website of the hotel promises a peaceful and friendly atmosphere, neither of which were our experience. Our room was noisey at night. One of the reasons we booked was because the website says it is airconditioned. This is only true in summer. At other times of the year, like when were there in September, we had to open the window facing the street which meant lots of traffic noise and talkative passers-by! Usually being a light sleeper, I was up and down several times a night opening and then closing the window because of the noise!

Certainly not particularly friendly. On the second day of our 6 night stay we asked for help as our room safe had been locked open. The staff member who came to assist, indicated that since we hadn't complained earlier that we must surely have locked it open ourselves despite our protests that wasn't the case at all. This didn't leave a nice taste in our mouths. While the location is close enough to the metro, the Eiffel Tower and the Rue Cler markets to be convenient, we found it disappointing that not even tea or coffee facilites were in the rooms.

We arrived in Paris at 10 am and check-in wasn't until 3 pm, but that was no trouble as we were allowed to leave our luggage at the front desk until our room was ready. The hotel is very clean, nicely decorated and staffed by friendly and accomodating individuals. Most speak English quite well, but did appreciate my attempts to speak/understand French. Our room was very small, typical of European hotel rooms, but since we did not intend to spend much time there, were not concerned by this. The bathroom was also very small and my husband, who is an average sized man by North American standards, had some difficulty closing the shower door behind him because it was a bifold 'in' instead of 'out'. Also, the shower stall was not caulked where it met the wall; if water sprayed there, it leaked out over the floor of the bathroom. That said, the rooms were spotlessly cleaned each day. The location of the hotel is perfect - close to the river, to the Eiffel tower, les Invalides, the d'Orsay, rue Cler and really everywhere you want to go (we walked to all of the above places, as well as to Notre Dame, the Louvre, the Latin quarter, etc, etc, etc,). If you return to your room very late and the front doors are locked, just ring the bell and the night person will cheerfully open them for you. At the end of the street, in the direction of les Invalides, there is a very good restaurant, on the corner, same side as the hotel ( I can't remember the name of it). We ate there on a Sunday. Both of us had the set menu (formule dimanche); it was delicious, cost only 36 euros each and included a 1/2 bottle of wine each. When dining out in Paris/France, the set menus offer very nice choices and are far more reasonably priced that ordering a la carte.

Stayed 3 nights and used the Paris Visite pass for transportation including from CDG airport, to Versailles, and the Nord station to catch the Eurostar to London. Overall fairly easy to use the RER, subway/light rail and bus (all included in Visite pass, we purchased 5 day 1-6 zone passes on arrival at CDG station). We also got Batobus passes which we didn't use as much, they take more time to stop, unload and load but nice to see Paris from the Seine, should have done only a one day. The hotel rooms are small but nicely decorated, bathrooms sparkle with white tile throughout. Has been noted previously, hair dryers are furnished but plugged in through dressing drawer, must stand up to see the mirror (in room), also need to keep on button pressed.

This hotel is clean, charming and the staff were helpful. Rooms are very small with a couple of feet between twin beds and other furnishings. 2 wardrobes with shelves, room safe, luggage rack, dressing table with a few drawers though not much room to sit there comfortably. Flat screen TV (BBC, CNN in English), reading lights, spa towels with bath mitt washcloths. We traveled with our 17 year old son and 10 year old daughter. Felt very safe and enjoyed the area, Rue Cler is a charming street to enjoy during the day with fresh markets and cafes, evening with dinner choices. Ecole Militaire was the most convenient tube stop within a couple of blocks. Small elevator (lift) will carry 2 people with suitcases.

We found Muguet to be a terrific value. We enjoyed the fact that we could walk to the Eiffel Tower whenever we felt the desire to see it twinkle at night - this was one destinations we didn't have to plan into our daytime itineraries because we knew it was in our neighborhood. We used the Ecole M. subway station every day, and it was an easy 5-minute walk. If you're looking for an exciting neighbhorhood with walkable nightlife, though, you should probably find another part of the city. If you want nearby conveniences, the close Rue Cler offers a lot. We skipped the hotel breakfast and ate heartier options in Rue Cler each morning. We picked up some essentials - bottled water, snacks, etc - at the Rue Cler supermarket - on our first day. And before we caught a train to Belgium, we bought wine, fruit, bread, and cheese in the Rue Cler market for lunch on the train. Know, though, that some businesses on the lovely Rue Cler were closed in late July/early August when we were there. The rooms were more stylish than I remembered from the website's photos, with attractive fabrics, wood furniture, and a modern TV. All three rooms and bathrooms were impressively clean. We needed a hotel that offered triple rooms, and that narrowed our search considerably. Muguet's triple offered my mother-in-law a bit of her own space with a night stand and lamp, a place to put her suitcase, and a small wall between her area of the room and ours. The bed was a bit low and cot-like, so it is not for the difficult sleeper, though she didn't have any problems. The bathroom was small for three people, but not small by European standards. We had to keep our toiletries in our suitcases until it was our turn to shower. Service was efficient and professional. Checking in and out happened in a flash. We were surprised that a young man sleeping on the lobby's couch had to let us in when we returned late, but that's how a small hotel has to be - at least there wasn't a lockout time nor a lack of security.

Muguet in Room 61. this was a good sized room for a small hotel. This particular room on the top floor had a nice view of the Eiffel Tower. The elevator only goes to the 5th floor and you have to walk up some narrow. slightly winding stairs to get to the rooms on tthe 6th floor - so note this if you do not travel lightly. THE ROOM: beds are not that comfortable - rather hard foam 4 inch mattresses and seem to be low to the ground and short - maybe twin length (we are tall people - so this may account for our discomfort with the height and length of the beds) ;beds are two twin beds - we would push together at night and the maids would separate again when making the beds - not a big deal - but thought I would mention it here; room is decorated very nicely and the bathroom is a good size with all modern plumbing. (Ladies note: they have a hair dryer available - but it is hard wired into the vanity desk by the beds and has a VERY short cord.) There is a small armoire in the room and a safe. the armoire was fine for the 3 of us and our clothes for the week. (oh and we realized a day or so into our stay that lamps could not be moved - they were somehow \"glued\" down to their spots - we thought this was both hilarious and slightly annoying and you could not turn off and on the table lamps individually -the switches were also somehow \"glued\" shut). The lights in this room are controlled by your room card - (you'll see what I mean if you get here) THE STAFF: cordial but not particularly friendly - unusual for a small hotel - and striking since we had travelled to Amsterdam and Brussels before this during our trip and stayed at large Marriotts - and I have to say - the staff there were much more accomodating and friendly. They helped, but did not generally go out of their way for much. One morning , my 18yr old son got up early and went downstairs because we told him there was breakfast available - - we forgot to tell him that it would be charged to the room . He went down the 1st morning we were there and started helping himself to cereal - well I guess the \"ladies\" spooked him as 3 of them came over to him and kept asking him what room he was in & telling him there was a charge .....needless to say - he never wanted to eat breakfast there again - -which was fine - as there was plenty of small cafes open in the morning within a less than 5 min walk., a supermarket and bakeries.... THE HOTEL: has a small, but nice main floor wating lounge; there was a garden breakfast room which looked nice but we really did not use at all; the location has enough small cafes nearby, a supermarket and a laundry. They have a PC in the main waiting room that you can use for 2E per half hour. It has limited functionality - but can get you online to many functions you would need it for while you are travelling anyway. It is in easy walking distance to the Eiffel Tower, Invalides and Rodin Museum. Within less than 5 minutes is a post office , metro stop, bus stop and taxi stand.

Also the safe which you operated by choosing your own numbers was a good help in keeping passports money etc. as your mind was at rest and you didn't need to carry all of your money about.

I wanted to experiece a hotel that felt like I was in Paris, not just a room to land in at the end of the day, and the Muguet fit that experience. The hotel was located off the main boulavard ( which also fit the bill for what I thought Paris should be like on my trip) on a small side street, in a neigborhood. The Lobby was charming. The room we had faced the back of the hotel, and we had a quiant view of other peoples homes and courtyards. At night , as we had been told, a neighbor ( a few streets away, played music that wafted through the night so we could hear it in the distance. Again charming. The bed was comfortable,with clean linens daily, the decor was also nice. The room was small , but we expected that. The bathroom clean, the shower, no tub, also very small with a rain shower head, tile was intact and looked cute as well as the sink and fixures. We liked our room., The water was hot as well.The rooms matched the pictures on line. We didn't need to use the air conditioner, so I can't say how that worked. Hair dryer was IN the drawer of a table in the room, the only thing that was funny was the cord ran to the back of the drawer to a plug beneath the table, so you couldn't move it to do ones hair and the line was short, good thing the mirror was juat above the table. ( I assume they did this to prevent theft of the hair dryer, but it worked ok, small hand held dryer. The staff was great and helpfull whenever we needed assistance. It was also quiet at night for sleeping. There is also a lift to the upper rooms, or one can climb the stairs. All carpeted. If one is disabled and needs a wheelchair it would be a good place to stay, if you you can still walk some, as there are no ground floor rooms ,and one would still need to be able to walk to the rooms from the lift on the upper floors, yet there is storage room on the first floor for an electric or regular wheelchair. Just thought I would add this for those who come here and may need to know this. The entrance way also had two steps to enter the hotel. We noticed the other guests ate the morning fair , which looked good 9 Euro's, but we chose to stroll to the little side streets nearby and buy our breatfast at the bakeries nearby, there were several to choose from. The guests also used the dining and lobby area to sit at night and chat about their day. I sat up one night and read a book when I couldn't sleep. Felt like I was at home in the lobby. There was staff from the hotel on duty 24hr a day, thought the night staff, single person, was cat napping on a sofa at night, but woke up when guests needed him, he was very nice. Short walk from the hotel lead us to a wide boulevard with everything one could want on a trip to Paris, little resturants with outside tables, different types of resturant fair, the italian restruants were wonderfull, when we wanted a change of pace. Grocery store near by as well, if one wanted to buy some wine and snacks to take back to the room. Other shops included candy store, flower shop and the Invalides Park is nearby for a stroll at night as well. The Eiffel Tower is 10 minute walk through a charming park, , as well as the Batobus ( best deal going). So the hotel was convient location for doing our day trips arround Paris. The hotel even had a locked room where we stored our luggage when our train didn't leave till after our check out time. No charge for this at all. Safe in every room for valuables, no refererator, NIce TV with remote and cable ( if you need to wind down after your day, CNN and BBC for those who need a dose of english speaking TV). SHampoo and complentary soaps too. I would stay again at the Muguet. I will try and figure out how to post some pictures this week of the hotel. We took several.

The hotel is not as close to the Eiffel tower as their website would have you believe, and you pay extra for a room with a view of the tower, however, that famous attraction was only around a 15 min walk away. My sister and I don't mind a bit of a walk, so on the first day we walked to the Louvre, a beautiful walk along the Seine, about 40 mins, and the second day we walked a bit further along to Notre Dame and then on to the Pompidou Centre, about another 10 mins walk. The room itself was, as I am led to believe is typical in Paris, very small, even though our twin beds were crammed so close together that if either of us rolled over too far in the night we'd have been in the other bed. There was also a bit of a problem with the street noise, as our room was at the front of the hotel. I solved this with earplugs. Also, during our stay we had a bit of an early summer heatwave, and the airconditioning is not turned on until June, so the room was quite stuffy during the night. This didn't stop me from sleeping, as hardly anything ever does, but my sister didn't sleep well during our stay, partly due to the noise and the stuffiness of the room. During summer I expect it would be much better, as you'd close the window and rely on the airconditioning. Having said this, the recent renovations (last year I think) were very obvious, the ensuite (no bath, but a fabulous shower) as well as the room itself was spotless, and there were two wardrobes with plently of hangers for both of us to hang up all our clothes. There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room, but the coffee and tea are available for a small charge in the lobby, as is internet access. The room had a flat screen digital TV, however, there were only the two obligatory English channels, CNN, and BBC News 24. There is no iron/board in the room, an iron is available during the daytime in the hotel laundry in the basement, and when we went down there the walls were hung with creepy animal skulls (hunting trophies, I hope!). Worse, the lady who showed us down there absent mindedly turned the light off on us when she got to the top of the stairs, so that my sister had to go back up in the pitch dark to ask them to turn the light back on. For a moment we thought we'd landed in the middle of a horror B-movie. We chose to eat breakfast at the hotel, which was an extra 9 Euros. It was an okay continental breakfast, with baguette, pastries, cold meat and cheeses, yoghurt, cereals and fresh coffee. I don't mind a continental breakfast but would have liked some toast. Overall I think we got good value for a hotel as centrally located as this one, but may consider somewhere else next time.", "Date": "June 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Experience!\u201d", "Author": "Sparky73", "ReviewID": "UR7796687", "Content": "Having never been to Paris or Europe I researched on Trip Advisor and trusted the feedback.

We decided on Hotel Muguet then contacted them directly to make the reservation. We took a taxi from the airport and upon arrival the hotel staff was very welcoming. We were given the key and shown to the elevator. The elevator is about the size of a restroom stall and we had to struggle to get 2 people and 2 suitcases inside. Once in our room I was very pleased at how warm and romantic it was. We paid extra for a 'room with a view' which turned out to be the backs of other buildings... not exactly the view we were hoping for. Anyhow, the staff was able to reserve space on a fancy dinner cruise and arrange a shuttle back to the airport as well as give directions around town, restaurant recommendations etc. which was very helpful. My husband and I loved the Rue Cler area and highly recommend staying in this hotel since it is so close to the metro, Eifel Tower and many good restaurants. Each morning for 9 Euro you could have a continental breakfast of bread, boiled eggs, yogurt and cheese. It was a little pricey for what it was but we ate at the hotel once because it was raining that morning. I highly recommend a short walk to a cafe or a bakery for a breakfast of coffee and eclairs. The only downfalls to this hotel are the small rooms, the fact the only iron (an old model with only one setting) available is in the dark-ish scary basement. So you have to bring your clothes all the way thru the hotel with you on the way to the iron which was very odd. The hair dryer is bolted into the desk drawer and the cord does not reach the bathroom (and the dryer is a poor model) and for some reason you are required to leave your room key at the front lobby desk every time you leave and although we never had a problem, made us feel that our belongings and purchases were not totally secure.

The hotel is clean enough and pretty enough, and the staff are cordial enough, but the rooms are just too small. Our room had a very firm king size bed, and it took up all the space. There was only room for one suitcase. I had to put my luggage under the desk. The desk could not be used without blocking the bathroom from the front door. All in all, the room was best suited to a lone traveler, despite the king sized bed.. The bathroom is so small that the hair dryer is in the desk drawer! Bizarre! The on-off switch and fan speed buttons for the air conditioner were actually hand-written. All of this was inconvenient enough, but the worst part of all was the hotel's policy on keys. The keys are the encoded plastic strips so popular around the world, but the hotel will only issue one per room, and requests (but does not insist) that you leave your key at the front desk each time you go out. I don't understand the logic behind this, but bottom line: I couldn't leave the room while my wife was sleeping, without troubling the front desk clerk to let me back in. We dropped our key off as they requested once or twice, until we realized that when we came back, they did not ask us for any identification to get the key back. So theoretically, anybody could walk in after the shift change at the front desk, claim to be us, and get our key.

It was the perfect place for us! We will always remember how genuinely pleasant and accommodating the entire staff was to us. Clean is a biggie for us, and this hotel is immaculate. Our lives are very hectic, so we looked for a hotel on a quiet side street. Hotel Muguet is close to Rue Cler, the Seine, Invalides, and the Eiffel Tower but it is nestled on a quiet, residential side street..and we loved the location! We love to walk and the hotel's location was super for that. We walked the streets Rue Cler and Rue Mouffetard and searched for the perfect baguette and the perfect crepe. We walked to the Seine and took not one but TWO bateaux mouches rides. We walked to the Eiffel Tower every day just for the fun of it. And our eyes were filled with amazement as we watched the tower sparkle each night from our room. We took the time to sit, talk, stare, share, smile and just be together with Paris. We are a fifty-something couple, and we felt like kids again. Ahh..pure magic. Yesterday as we were sitting in the hotel lobby waiting for our van to arrive to take us to the aiport, my husband was taking a few photos of the hotel.

The remodeling was only a minor inconvenience in getting around the painters and wet paint. Not really a problem. The service, though, was merely OK. Housekeeping did provide toiletries for showering, but it was fun each day to see what they'd leave. One day it was shower gel and soap, but no shampoo. Next day, you get shampoo but no soap. Kinda quirky, but still not really a problem. The front desk staff was, I think, trying to go for an aloof, professional Parisian image, but unfortunately, they just consistently came off as rude. Even with my broken French, I have always been treated courteously in my other visits to France, so I was not impressed with this visit. The rate was the same as hotels I've stayed in in Paris with higher star ratings, so I didn't really find this to be a value.

Cleaning was typically done in the 1-3pm range and seemed very thorough. Overall I had a great experience staying there, my main complaints are geared more towards the neighborhood. If you're a young person the 7th is a bit slow and while Metro access is great there isn't a whole lot of nightlife and affordable restaurant diversity in the area. This has its good side too as relatively speaking it felt a lot less touristy than Montmartre or St Germain and seemed very safe.

The rooms are small (but this was really no big deal for my husband and I). The bathrooms are immaculate and we had towel service everday, which I did not expect. The housekeeping did a great job everyday changing our linens and cleaning up. The service is great, we especially like the two gentlemen who worked the night shift. They had an ELEVATOR! Which seems really important after walking the entire city. I ate the breakfast twice, it is sort of a nice change if you have been eating out a lot, or are just really exhausted. Other advice: Breakfast at the hotel isn't as cheap as going to the bakery around the corner on Avenue De La Motte-Piquet where we would pick up a quiche (chaud) a pain du chocolate (frois) and a baquette for about 6 Euros total. Across the street from that bakery is the SuperMarche where you can pick up some cold-cuts, fruit, juice boxes and bottles of water to fill out the first two meals of the day for another 4 or 5 euros. I recommend the Spanish Clemetines, they travel really well. (You can also pick up a 6 euro bottle of champagne and chill it outside your window at the hotel). Dec/Jan are COLD months in Paris. Pack a nicer jacket than we did (we wore ski-type jackets and stuck out like sore thumbs). Think wool peacoat and the like. An umbrella as well, as it did snow and rain a little. Because of this, we were able to see a lot of sights with out a lot of crowds, so putting up with the rain was well worth it. Don't buy the metro \"pass\" unless you are staying from Sunday-Saturday. If you buy midweek you lose some value. My husband and I shared \"Carnets\" and felt that we got the best value that way. Definitely buy the longest possible Carte D'Musee you can.

The beds are firm and very comfortable with crisp clean linens and great big fluffy towels are in supply in the bathrooms. The soap and shampoo are a little rudimentary, however this was not a problem for me as I always travel with my own.(Changing soaps too often irritates the skin). There is no mini-bar in the room and the \"faux antique\" furniture though charming is not very practical as the drawers are faux as well (they don't open) so one has only limited surface area to put stuff.

The hotel is in a very good, safe and upscale neighborhood of Paris which is also blessedly quiet (I slept like a rock both nights and I am a very light sleeper). I took taxis to wherever I needed to go (Champs Elysee, Moulin Rouge...etc) to save time and never paid more than from six to ten euros (my furthest point was Gare Du Nord) including tip.

Located near 2 metro stops. We only used the metro twice and walked everywhere else. With a good pair of walking shoes on you will discover what a treat this hotel is. Located away from the general hussle and bussle and after spending 8 hours in the centre of paris it was nice to retreat back to this quiet little haven. I would highly recommend it.

We arrived via the Golden Air shuttle, which they recommended, and were instantly impressed with the simple charm and cleanliness of this hotel. The staff at the desk spoke good English and were professionally efficient, i.e. giving directions and advice on restaurants and shopping, making phone calls for us, etc. Our room was indeed small, with twin beds and very little room to move around in, and no seating area. The bathrooms, however, were good sized with a cruise-ship sized shower, hair dryer, and even a make-up mirror next to the sink. If you are particular, you might bring your own soap and shampoo as theirs were not high quality. The fluffy towels were large and replaced daily, as were the sheets. We found the beds to be a bit smaller than US twins, but were comfortable and we slept well. There was also a mirrored closet and safe. Our window faced rue Chevert, which is a residential street with little traffic. The area is clean and feels safe. We probably could have seen the Eiffel if we had been on a higher floor, but we were on the second. The windows keep out the street noise and open for fresh air. The tv worked by remote, and you can get BBC or French stations. It is only a short walk to rue Cler with many shops and restaurants, a post office, several ATMs, and 2 metro stops. We also were able to buy Carte Orange and museum passes at the Ecole Militaire metro station. These proved to be excellent values, saving money and lots of time getting into the museums. The hotel breakfast for 8.5 Euros is not a bad value, although we only ate there once. It is probably the only place you can get cold cereal, yogurt or a boiled egg. With so many other options nearby, we had a wide choice of places to eat. Be aware of their hours (which are all different) so you don't arrive before or after closing. Catherine, the owner, is there daily and maintains a well-run hotel. The decor is simple and tasteful, with calm colors. We felt we got good value for the price and would recommend it for others wanting a very clean, comfortable and convenient room. The hotel is usually full, so reseve well ahead of time. I think they have heat and air conditioning, although neither were necessary while we were there. We liked being able to walk to the Eiffel tower each evening to see the lights.

The breakfast was standard fare...croissant, coffee, yogurt, boiled eggs..

It was not much of a view, but then again, we weren't in Paris to sit looking out of the bedroom window! The only inconvienience was the apartment opposite us which directly faced our window, so we had to close the curtains for a little privacy! The air conditioning was off (or didn't work? i didn't really ask) which was a bit annoying. We went to Paris prepared for the miserable weather we had been having in Ireland, but instead got 4 beautiful days of sunshine. (Hats and scarves out the window!) We had to leave the window open a lot of the time, which was kind of annoying because the weather gave rise to mosquitoes-BIG mosquitoes! My fiance is allergic to bites and stings so the A/C thing was kind of bad. Apart from that, our stay was wonderful. The bed was comfortable, if a little too soft, and the room was always spotless. I had no such problem as the couple who could not check in. We arrived at 12.00 and we were able to check in no problem. The staff were lovely, and very friendly if you approach them with a little French. Although i did notice that they were sort of indifferent to people who just went straight up and started speaking english. Thae breakfast, which we only partook of on the morning we left (we slept in too late most mornings, and they only serve breakfast til 10.30.) was very good value.

We booked a triple room at Hotel Muguet. The Muguet is an efficiently run, spotless and well-kept small hotel. Our triple room was very spacious, and the beds were comfy (once you removed the plastic matress cover....). The rooms were nicely appointed (not luxurious, but very, very nice) and there was PLENTY of room for 3 large suitcases and 3 women's paraphernelia. (I did check out several other double rooms, and found that they were much smaller than our triple. Cozy, but not too small.) The bathroom was very modern, done in white tile, and had a spectacular bath/shower combo. We decided to stay in the Eiffel Tower area for the quiet neighborhood and proximity to great restaurants. We visited Rue Cler (a <5 minute walk--2 1/2 blocks away) every morning in lieu of the hotel breakfast. Rue Cler is a great little marketplace located in a 2 block area with an array of cafes, patisseries and a phenomenal crepe restaurant in the middle block (it is actually a Greek restaurant, \"Ulysses\", run by a really neat family--father, mother who mans the crepe maker in front of the restaurant and 2 sons who speak perfect English and are friendly and VERY helpful. This place is legendary....people RAVE about the crepes, and they are fabulous!! I got her to sneak some tomatoes in with eggs and cheese. WHAT A TREAT!!!). There are a number of great little restaurants in the area....one of our faves was L'Auberge du Champ de Mars on rue de l'Exposition just a few blocks from the Eiffel Tower. The couple that own the restaurant--Madeleine & Michel--are enchanting and the food is tremendous! (We had a late dinner there one night, and I took off without my big, digital camera. I realized my loss the next morning, and asked the lady at the front desk to call L'Auberge for me. Madeleine answered and said they had found it and I could come claim it any time. They were so nice...big hugs and well wishes from both of them. GREAT people, and talented restauranteurs.) There are 2 metro stops JUST around the corner from the Muguet which provide easy access to virtually every corner of Paris. I had read the reviews about the unfriendly ladies at the front desk, and was prepared for the worst. What we found was that if you attempt to communicate, even with just a little fledgling French, they are extremely helpful. Just don't try to pet the little poodle that accompanies one of them...I just about got my hand snapped off! The lady that owns Muguet, Catherine, is fastidious. One morning I found her wiping down the legs of every chair in the breakfast room. She runs a very tight ship, and insists that every inch of the hotel is SPOTLESS. And it is! I met a man who had triend to book into Muguet, but the hotel was full. He said he travels to Paris regularly, and always tries to stay at Hotel Muguet. He also said that it is the #1 rated hotel on the AOL travel site. I would definitely come back to Hotel Muguet.

We love the location of this boutique hotel and also the homey feeling. Other features we enjoy: cleanliness, extra large towels and bath mitts and comfortable beds. The breakfast room had been redone since our visit in 2002. We dined in the garden room each morning. For 8 Euro we had our choice: boiled eggs, sliced ham, cheeses, yogurt, cold cereal, fresh squeezed orange juice, croissants, baguettes, butter and assorted jams, oranges, apples, pastry, and of course all the coffee we wanted, hot tea, milk and hot chocolate. If you've eaten out in Paris, you'll spend about 4 euro for a grand cafe' with creme. We ate a good breakfast everyday, as we walked several miles a day, enjoying the gardens of Paris. We also enjoy the neighborhood and especially the nice walk to the Eiffel Tower (at least once a day) You can't get too many pictures of the Eiffel Tower, especially when the lights twinkle on the hour for 10 minutes. This year we choose a room by the garden and enjoyed the ground floor location just off the breakfast room. We would not choose those rooms again, as they are the smallest. However the closet was large and we had just enough room. I liked the previous rooms we've had, as there were drawers available. We managed even with our 4 pieces of luggage. The bathrooms are all white and blue tile and offer plenty of space. Our room had a tub/shower combination and each room has a hair dryer. The hair dryer is the type where you must keep a grip on the handle to make they dryer run. We had just come from Austria where they had the same type. It was a new concept to me, but it worked well. Many people may prefer a larger hotel, with bigger TV and larger rooms, which is understandable. We found Madame Catherine and her Mother very pleasant and helpful, even though we arrived a day earlier than our reservation said. She was \"Glad to Recieve us\" was her comment. It was my error and yet she was gracious to get us situated in our room. Jacqueline has been there over 4 years and always so helpful. We found all the staff very nice. We do not speak French but always greeted the staff upon coming and going in French... just a simple Bonjour Madame, or Bonsoir, or Bonne Nuit depending on the time of day. We also enjoyed visits with other guests in the breakfast room each morning. Met a nice couple (Dan & Bonnie) from Paris, Canada and another lovely couple from Michigan. Meeting people and sharing travel tips is part of the fun for us. For the price of 87 Euro for 2 people, including tax, we found this to be a bargain. I'm kinda wishing we'd kept it a secret.

I did months of research before choosing this hotel and my decision was based largely on the reviews posted on this site. Since I\u2019ve benefitted from this service, I feel it\u2019s now my responsibility to post a glowing review of my own. My expectations were high, and I\u2019m pleased to report that they were surpassed by this charming hotel. The Hotel Muguet is located in the 7th arrondissement, a beautiful, elegant neighbourhood in Paris. It\u2019s owned by Madame Catherine Pelltier, and before her, I believe it was run by her mother. Every e-mail question that I sent to Madame Pelltier was answered practically within the hour. The airport shuttle driver dropped us at the hotel at 7am and the front desk staff were very courteous, allowing us to lock our bags in a storage room until check-in time at 2pm. We freshened up in the hotel\u2019s public toilette, then started our day of sightseeing with a stroll around our neighbourhood. The 7th arrondissement is a safe, elegant and convenient neighbourhood, full of caf\u00e9s, brasseries and shops to explore. Rue Cler, a fresh food market street, is just a five-minute stroll from the hotel. My husband and I went there daily for fresh fruit, sandwiches, or some roast chicken and a bottle of wine to take back to the hotel. For a thoroughly mouth-watering description of the treats that Rue Cler has to offer, as well as a handy map of the shops that line the street, visit ---------. There are two Metro stops very close to the Muguet, Ecole Militare and La Tour Maubourg, so in no time, you can be sightseeing halfway across the city! I loved the Metro \u2013 it was fast, cheap and convenient. If you\u2019re staying in Paris for a week or more, get a metro map and a carte orange pass instead of tickets. The Hotel Muguet is a beautiful six-story building in the typical architectural style that most of us associate with Paris: a Mansaart roof, wrought-iron balconies and floor to ceiling windows. While the building may be old, on the inside, the hotel is thoroughly modern. I\u2019ll begin by mentioning that it\u2019s air-conditioned, a rare find in a two-star hotel. We appreciated this feature on a few very warm days during our stay. We paid $105 Euros per night for our room, #53, which had a King-sized bed and a spectacular view of la Tour Eiffel. Every night, I could see it sparkling madly in the distance, a sight I\u2019ll never forget. On my first morning in Paris, I jumped out of bed at 6:30 am, threw open the heavy curtains at our window, stepped onto our little balcony and marveled at the sight of the Tower in the distance, bathed in early morning sun light. With Paris waking up in the streets below me, what could be more magical? Our room was small, but not inconveniently so. The bathroom had a shower, but no bathtub. My husband, a broad man, found the shower stall a bit narrow but I had no problem with it. The bed was quite comfortable and we slept solidly every night, exhausted from sightseeing. The hotel offers a light breakfast in their 1st floor garden room and I believe that you can get caf\u00e9 at any time, but there is no other food service once breakfast is finished. If you enjoy room service, you'll want to stay somewhere else. We found there were so many wonderful, inexpensive places to eat just steps from the hotel, the lack of room service was never a problem. I can also report that there are a couple of small grocery stores in the neighbourhood where you can buy a fantastic selection of beer and wine, as well as snacks and any grooming products you might need. My French is quite limited, but I enjoyed practicing with the front desk staff, who were quite patient. Most of the other guests seemed to be Anglophones and I heard them speaking easily with the hotel staff. Even if you have no knowledge of French, you won\u2019t have any problems at this hotel. As in most hotels in France, you leave your room key at the front desk when you go out for the day. This may seem odd to some people, but I really liked the system because it kept us from losing our key. The hotel closes its doors at midnight, but if you return after that, you just ring the doorbell and the night porter will let you in. Every day when we returned to our room, we found it thoroughly cleaned and tidied and smelling faintly of grapefruit \u2013 very refreshing. The thick, fluffy towels were restocked daily. My husband had only one small complaint: the hotel has just one tiny, traditional elevator. When we checked in and out, we had to ride separately since two people and all of their luggage won\u2019t fit. I thought the old elevator was charming. A large modern elevator, while convenient, would be inappropriate in this hotel. Most days, I preferred taking the elegant staircase to and from our fifth-floor room. When you\u2019re eating as many delicious omelettes as I was, a little extra exercise is welcome. I\u2019m more than a little melancholy now that my holiday is over. Paris is the most spectacular city I've ever visited and staying at the Muguet not only put us in the heart of the Parisian neighbourhood of my dreams, it also put us in touch with the city\u2019s charming daily rituals.

Against it: the bed is low, with a waterpoof sheet under the fitted sheet, and 2 twins are pushed together to make a queen; the walls and doors are thin, so while street noise is no issue, hallway noise can be if you retire early; the furniture has no drawers; they turned off the A/C while we were there because it turned cool outside, even though the sun heated our room (but turned it back on after we requested it); little English is spoken but the folks who do are quite helpful if you do a little French; the rooms are tiny, as is the TV, and the only English language channels are news all the time; you'll want your own soap and shampoo (and hair dryer); there is no window cover to darken the bathroom window if you so desire; and no pants hangers.
