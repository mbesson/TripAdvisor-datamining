The rooms are really nice and staff is generally friendly. Everything is very clean and housekeeping is efficient. As stated in the other reviews, the location is central but not very good. Lots of homeless and strange people on the street. I don't think it's really unsafe but wouldn't recommend the hotel to people who are easily scared or women travelling alone.The breakfast is good compared to other hotel / motels in the US in a similar price range (choice of bagels, eggs, cereal, fresh fruit, waffles) but gets a bit boring after a while when staying longer. Coffee is American style, there's no espresso. The free wireless internet is good but sometimes slow and not very reliable - this could be improved. There is onsite parking but the 25$ a day is more than I paid for my rental car - so I decided to use street parking. It is possible to find street parking around the hotel, but it's metered during the day (9am - 6pm) and you have to carefully watch the signs for restrictions.

My husband went to go get our bags to change them to the new hotel and there were police everywhere and he was told two guys were shot and one was killed.
