I would not say that the hotel is cheap but considering its location I could not find a better deal. The next time I go to Barcelona I would not bother so close to the center since public transport is so efficient in the city. The staff were very friendly and courteous and were awake round the clock. The room is really really small but the bathroom was comparatively spacious. The room was cleaned and towels replaced daily. The breakfast is 8 euros but when you stay so close to La Ramblas why would one eat at the hotel. The walls do not protect against noise but when you are awake all night clubbing you hardly notice. If you are a solo traveler then this place is ok but if you are with your family then I would not recommend this place.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly adequate for one or two nights\u201d", "Author": "Pushkathecat Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR127574852", "Content": "The hotel was very easy to get to from the airport. I took the Aerobus to Placa Catalunya and the hotel was diagonally across the square. Check in was no problem and the staff were polite and efficient. As I was only there overnight and leaving early morning, I settled the bill there and then. It was exactly as the easytobook.com invoice with no unpleasant surprises. I had booked a single room which was facing the inner courtyard as were all the single rooms. The room was quite small with a small double bed, bedside unit, built-in cupboard and tv on stand. It had a frosted glass window which opened and a modern ensuite bathroom. It was all very clean and there were nice little touches like toiletries and a comb in the ensuite, but unfortunately there was a distinct unpleasant smell of drains. As I didnt go in any of the other rooms, I dont know if that was confined to just my room or others on that side of the hotel as well. The only other problem I had during my stay was a few interruptions during the night with people coming in at all hours and making a racket in the corridor - it wasnt the most peaceful night's sleep by any means. I didnt sample the breakfast as I left before the restaurant opened so cant comment on that. However, as has been said in many reviews, the main redeeming feature of the hotel is the location. You really cannot get much better. There are buses and metro trains from Placa Catalunya to virtually all parts of the city and main attractions, the top of Las Ramblas is right outside the door and it is a short stroll to many superb restaurants. So in a nutshell, this hotel is exactly as it says it is: a clean, well run, fairly basic two-star hotel in an excellent location and for the price is perfectly adequate for one or two nights as a stop-over. If that is what you are after I would recommend it, but not if you are planning a family holiday or a romantic weekend for two.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cMONEGAL HOTEL, BARCELONA\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR124950968", "Content": "We arrived at the hotel, surprised to find the reception at the back of a watch shop, but never the less, the reception staff were very helpful, spoke english, and showed us the sights to see.

The bed looked tired and worn and we questioned whether there would be bed bugs in it. It was an uncomfortable sleep as well. The bathroom was clean so at least that was a bonus. The breakfast wasn't worth it, the coffee was disgusting, I'd recommend heading out and buying something real from any local cafe and bypass the hotel breakfast. Location of the hotel was good if you want to be near old town. It's at the top of La Ramblas and there are a lot of warnings of pickpockets, but it's fine if you are simply aware and take necessary precautions - like wear your backpack or bag on the front. The end of La Ramblas has a few strip clubs so I'm sure it would be dodgy at night time just like other reviewers say. We avoided it at night time so we never saw any of that.

After landing at El Prat airport we got the bus to Placa Catalunya (centre of Barcelona). The Hotel is also on the same square so it was literally a 1 minute walk from the bus stop. After being allocated a room at the back of the hotel we went to reception to request a room with a view of Placa Catalunya. The receptionist changed our room without any hesitation. Staff were quite cordial and very helpful regarding directions. Our room and bathroom were spotlessly clean, we had a Samsung flat-screen TV, and a small balcony with a great view of the square and La Rambla. In general the room was reasonably comfortable and the shower was good also. The twin room was quite inexpensive, only \u00a324 each per night. The Monegal does have a rather strange set up - you have to walk through a jewelry store to get to reception and some of the upper floors seem to share the premises with other businesses but don't let this put you off. In terms of location, it doesn't get any more central than this, the hotel is right on La Rambla and close enough to all of the major attractions Barcelona has to offer. We used the Tourist Bus (Bus Turisitic) to see most of the major sights and we even got a discount for our bus tickets at the hotel. The tourist bus leaves every few minutes almost right outside the hotel. We also used the Metro stop outside our hotel to get about, its relatively inexpensive in comparison to the Tube in London and quite easy to navigate your way around. The best method of travel in Barcelona is on foot, as you will see so much more. Close to the hotel is La Boqueria de San Josep, the largest food market in Spain. La Boqueria has hundreds of stalls selling fresh fruit, meat, fish and wine. There are also some great Tapas restaurants here such as El Quim and one known simply as La Boqueria. Behind the hotel is a maze of backstreets that retain their old world rustic charm and an 18th century Baroque style church called Iglesia de Sant Agusti which is also worth visiting. The Rambla outside the hotel is noisy 24/7 and the walls are quite thin but bring ear plugs and you should sleep fine. I'd advise against eating on La Rambla as food/drink prices are much higher than a few streets away and your less likely to get authentic tapas, however the large supermarket on La Rambla is quite cheap. Take care with your money and belongings as pick-pocketing is rife, although we didn't experience anything of that nature during our stay. Restaurants worth visiting are La Tropezon in the Gothic Quarter, Can Pep also in the Gothic Quarter and El Quim in La Boqueria. In terms of sights to visit, Park Guel and Sagrada Familia are stunning. In closing, if you want a decent hotel that's slap bang in the centre of Barcelona and one which is very reasonably priced then The Monegal is for you. This is a great base to see the city and chances are you will spend most of your time out exploring what Barca has to offer.

The room was larger than expected. It had a small TV, a desk and two beds. Everything seemed clean although a bit run-down. I did not particularly like the detergent they used (smelled rather strong) but at least it was clear that they had at least washed everything (towels, linen etc). The bathroom was also bigger than I expected (considering the pretty low price \u20ac60 per night for two people). It had a bath tub and they actually also provided shampoo, shower gel and soap. It had the same worn feeling as the rest of the room (and the hotel in general) but it was clean. The room we got also had a small balcony facing the back. Luckily we did not have any window facing the street, we did however still hear a lot of noise from the surrounding rooms (the walls and the door seemed to be paper thin) so light sleepers should bring earplugs. From what I understood there was wifi available at the hotel (did not test it myself) but there was no minibar or fridge in the room. I also missed some type of safe in the room (did not ask at the reception if I could store stuff there) especially since the door seemed to be so thin that it could easily be kicked or even pushed down.

The entrance is through a jewelry store with the hotel reception desk tucked in there with an elevator that holds three people only. The room actually start on about the 3 or 4th floor so if you are in a room that is 200 something you are really higher than you think. You do NOT want to be on the front of the hotel. The rooms at the back don't have much of a few but they are very quiet - despite the fact you are tucked in the middle of the tourist area. I was traveling with two friends they were in sincle rooms 400 and 219 and at the back and quiet. My wife and I were in 221 a double and it was also quiet. Breakfast is continental coffee and juice and various breads... some yogart but it is pretty cheap - worth it probably for the convenience. Free wireless internet that works reasonably well. The rooms (especially the singles) were small but clean. The bath rooms were bigger than average and had recently been done so that they had moder fixtures and even a bidet.

The access to the Metro is outside the hotel entrance, the Aerobus from the airport stops across the Plaza (for the Hotel entrance look across the Plaza for the McDonald's and Burger King signs). The hotel reception is at the back of a jewelry store. We never had any trouble getting in or out. There is a three person elevator that moves slowly but does the job. The stairs themselves are marble and worn on the first two flights (a slip hazard if you aren't careful). Our room was a twin bedded ensuite room with high celings and double doors which opened onto to a tiny balcony facing the Plaza. Noise was an issue as Catalunya Plaza and Las Rambles are active 24 hours a day. If noise bothers you, you may wish to request a room away from the Plaza. The decor is dated and struck me as masculine (tidy guy dorm ambience?). The weather was beautiful so we didn't need the available A/C or heat. The twin beds came with a bedspread, two blankets, and a decent king size pillow. The mattress was very firm. There is room to walk on either side and between the beds - actually walk not squeeze. There is plenty of storage, but no drawers. The closet, which is in the entry area of the room, had shelves and a hanging area for our clothes with room left over for two pieces of luggage. There is a room safe in the closet which we did not use since it seemed to require a key we did not have. In addition there is a built in desk and luggage rack (you can fit 4 pieces of luggage in this room without it ever getting in your way). The phone rests on the shelf between the beds. There are overhead lights as well as a reading light and a desk lamp. The website says there is free internet but we did not try to access it so I cannot comment on the speed or reliability. The bathroom was clean and European small but not tiny. The bathtub was cute - full depth and width but only about 4 feet long. Water pressure was good but not invigorating. There was plenty of hot water. They provided small soaps and shampoos. I spotted a hair dryer behind the hotel desk that looked like it might be available for guests but there is not one in the room. The bathroom lighting is adequate but noisy as the single switch always turns on the light and the fan. Some of the rooms in the hotel share a bath down the hall. The common bath had a little bit longer tub, toilet, sink, and bidet. My 18 year old college daughter and I agreed it would not have been a problem to use that bathroom if our room was not ensuite. The maid cleaned daily and left a new body and face towel, each time. We had no trouble with theft over our 7 day stay, even when my daughter left two rings on the sink while we went out one day. The breakfast was \u20ac5 per person and available until 11:30 a.m. I thought it was a decent deal for when we wanted breakfast but we did not want to duck around the corner to Las Rambles. Breakfast included multiple baskets of a variety of pastries, butter, jelly, cereals, milk, yogurt, coffee, tea, hot chocolate (packets), orange juice and grapefruit juice. Meats and fruit were not offered. The staff was always pleasant, welcoming, and helpful. All spoke some English, some spoke a lot of English so we never had communication problems.

We wanted something basic at a good price which was either on or near Las Ramblas. This hotel is located at the top of Las Ramblas and directly opposite Placa Catalunya which means: - next to the starting point for the Tourist hop-on/off buses - has a bus direct to the airport ~40mins - is close to a number of large shopping centres - has Metro and Renfe stops outside the door - has McDonalds and Subway within a minute (for when you need a break from Paella and Ham & Cheese rolls) :) The hotel is entered via a watch shop and has the reception desk and elevator/stairs at the end. Don't let this put you off - I mean how useful is a gorgeous entrance to a hotel when you're on a city break. The reception speak English to a good/satisfactory level and we had no problems communicating. The hotel is very well priced considering it's location, location, location. We stayed in Room 208 and had views of Las Ramblas and Placa Catalunya via our balcony which was well cool. For some this may be noisy but I like opening the balcony doors and you can hear the buskers/musicians playing away and hear the vibe of the city. If you must - sleep with earplugs. The room itself was small but reasonable in size. It was very clean and the bathroom had recently been renovated and looked new and modern. I had a few reservations when I booked this hotel as I couldn't find any photos anywhere of the room. But thankfully these fears were allayed once we got to our room. There is no tea/coffee facilities but didn't bother me as there's 100 cafe's downstairs. Only negative for us was the heating in the room was not the warmest and we asked for extra blankets - problem solved. So if you're the kind of person/couple that use your hotel room purely for storing your stuff, sleeping and showering then this is what you're looking for (and what I always go for as I'm never in the room). If you want bells, whistles and glamour then you'll need to go elsewhere and spend. Also, walking down Las Ramblas on the right hand side about 5 minutes from the hotel is a supermarket (if you want to stock your room with drinks). Also about 10minutes down Las Ramblas on the right is a fresh produce market - I recommend grabbing some fruit there as it is delicious!
