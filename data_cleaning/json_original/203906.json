{"Reviews": [{"Content": "OK once you're inside Need to be aware with this hotel that it is a cheap hotel for Florence and don\u9225\u6a9b expect too much! I was a little disappointed when I turned up: the hotel is pretty central (our room had an oblique view of the Duomo, which is about 10 minutes walk away) but the immediate surrounding area can be a little less salubrious than other areas closer to the centre, with a few people sleeping rough and people drinking under some of the arches nearby. For this reason I\u9225\u6a87 not recommend it for people travelling on their own as the last couple of minutes' walk can be a little uncomfortable \u9225?although it was fine in reality. The hotel is situated on the fourth floor of a residential block and is accessed via a lift, so there is no frontage to speak of. At night, there is an intercom system to have the front doors opened. Once in the room, it was bare but functional, and very clean, with air conditioning and a small wetroom style shower and WC. The staff are good and breakfast is fine. It\u9225\u6a9a worth going up to the roof to have a look at the view. In all, the hotel is fine if you\u9225\u6a99e just after a cheap stay in Florence but probably not too good for a romantic weekend.", "Date": "Jul 6, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR261794157", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "JHH-7"}, {"Content": "Good hotel in Florence, very nice staff The folks at Bodoni were very nice and helpful; they are multilingual and easy to get along with. The room was nice for a discount hotel. Bed was typical of Europe. It was fairly convenient from the train station. It was quiet and the bathroom was nice. Overall, one of the nicer places we stayed in Europe.", "Date": "Oct 1, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR299812295", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "hotel rustique   showReview(19496482, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR798775593", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Tocquee"}, {"Content": "H\u4e48tel surann\u8305   showReview(18070672, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR730067299", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Lavache"}, {"Content": "Muy buena ubicacion, muy familiar.   showReview(12758994, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR499475877", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Yemo"}, {"Content": "Deux \u8305toiles poussives   showReview(8579766, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR441611350", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "poupine"}, {"Content": "Hotel tr\u732bs simple bien situ\u8305   showReview(7381449, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR697151401", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "SebdeParis"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d203906-r3638944-Bodoni-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "203906", "Price": "$129"}}
