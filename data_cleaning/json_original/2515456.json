The maid SERVICE did not into clean entirely. We left trash neatly tied in a bag next to the trash can and it was left there after maid service. Our bathroom sink area was not wiped down, no fresh towels left. Ice machine on our floor did not work, had to go to another floor to get ice. Not the best for families with small children. You have to pay for children's programming. Luckily we have our own DVD player. Overnight parking really expensive plus you have to use valet which requires tipping each time you need your car. I did not bring any of these issue to the attention of the hotel staff as I find most complaints are really addressed with more than lip service. I would stay again, just not with kids.

Upon entering the hotel you are greeted with construction which I already knew so that was no surprise. When we entered our hotel room it looked pretty clean until we pulled the blankets back and found blood on the sheets. I brought this to the attention of the front desk and they apologized and said room service would fix it. Room service came in and made the bed and cleaned the room so we didnt even think to check that they changed the sheets since that was our sole complaint. The next morning we threw the covers off the bed and there and behold were the same sheets...now I am completely grossed out. We stayed for 4 days and were never given a new bottom sheet. Upon checkout I again mentioned this and they said I would get POINTS on our rewards card. They didnt even give us half the amount of points for a one night stay. We took a dip in the hottub which had a top layer of foam which was covered in a green slime. We promptly got out and took showers. We were woken up to the loud sounds of union protests Saturday morning. I also felt the thermostat was not cool enough even though we had it on the lowest setting. I thought the conceirge desk was very helpful with several suggestions of great places to eat and how to get around. Overall just too many major things wrong for a 4 night stay to earn a good review.. which had little to nothing to do with construction more a lack of attention to detail and cleanlines.

The Westin Gaslamp does not meet this standard. At checkin, we learned it was $10 a day for wireless! Come on, who still charges for wireless? But that was only the first surprise..... I write this on night 5 of a 7 day stay. Days one and two were spent with no hot water. Nothing like not being able to shower in the morning! Day two also saw the elevators out of order. With the service elevators overtaxed, we got a free workout seeing as we are on the 11th floor. On day 4 it was labor unrest. A full volume demonstration with drums, loud speakers and picketing protestors was just ourside the front door of the lobby and lasted for 3 hours. At the start of day 5 we were down to 2 of the 4 elevators working and a very long wait for a ride to or from the lobby. This was because there was fresh tile laid in front of the other two elevators. The rest of the hall is in the process of being renovated now. I wonder if any of the elevators will be running tomorrow morning? On the positive side, the room was very nice - except the pocket door in the bathroon doesn't close all the way so privacy is limited. The staff is very helpful and cooperative, but if I was looking to stay in the Gaslamp area of San Diego, I would wait until May at least for the renovations to be finished or you will be in for some surprises like we have experienced.

I was a little worried based on the reviews mentioning construction, but in my room request (Deluxe City View w/King room at $153 a night) I asked to be away from the construction and not have a room with an adjoining door. That worked like a charm because I got a room 1639 on the top floor! It had great views and I didn't hear any construction noise at all. There was some street noise still, especially echoing of sirens at night, but I got used that that quickly. One bummer was that even though my computer picked up the signal of free wireless spots, none of them actually worked. I had my own hotspot, but beware that the Westin's wifi does cost money. There was also limited dresser drawers if you're staying multiple nights with someone else. There were 3 smaller sized drawers in the closet, but that was all. At least there were a good # of hangers. One thing the hotel had that I had never seen before was the option to be green and skip housekeeping FOR MONEY. I've been to hotels before where they ask you to be green by opting out of new towels, etc, but this time they offered you a $5 credit to their facilities (pseudo-Starbucks, bar, etc.). I don't mind passing on housekeeping so I did this every day I was there, except for the night before check out which they don't offer the deal for. Each day I got to treat myself to a Starbucks drink as a result! The hotel was green in other ways, too. They had a recycling bin in the room (1st I've seen) and used toilet paper that contained at least 20% post consumer product. In their gym, which is open 24 hours, the elliptical machines save the energy from/get powered by your workout. Speaking of their fitness center, I have to give it props. It has a more than a full set of dumb bells, has a full body workout machine, several ellipticals and treadmills, and a recumbent and upright bike. They have a water fountain with cups, but I used the bottled water that they give you for free in the room. Towels are also available, even moist, cooled ones kept in a mini fridge. The location of the hotel was probably the best part. It's 2 blocks away from the light rail/trolley transit, right next to the Horton Plaza mall (has a CVS very close by if you want to stock your mini fridge) if you want to do some shopping, and in the gas lamp quarter which gives you a ton of restaurant options! A cab from the airport to the hotel, and back, average $15 without tip. We had a car for a few nights, and the parking at the hotel was $32 a day, with unlimited in/out privileges. But you have to leave with the valet, so it's more when you factor in tipping. Even though $32 seems pricey, I checked around the immediate area and nowhere else had a lower rate. I requested a later check out time, and was able to get 1pm, although I didn't end up needing it. When I checked out, the hotel employee asked how everything was. I told her there were a few hiccups (hot water didn't work one morning) and another morning there was a random, but loud, protest next door to the hotel at 7 am. She felt my pain and gave me a $20 credit, which was good at the same places as the $5 green credit. Before I left, I was able to stock up on Starbucks drinks for me and my friends. Overall, this was good choice for a place to stay. They seem to be aware of the problems they're having due to their construction and priced the room accordingly. Once the construction is done, I'm sure this place with be even better (and more expensive)!", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "corona", "Title": "\u201crecent visit\u201d", "Author": "rudel7249", "ReviewID": "UR127035724", "Content": "We found the staff most courteous and accommodating.

For Westin's reputation, I expected better. There were problems with the hot water. Basically we got frozen than burned in the showers. Other occupants complained of the same thing that weekend. The only good night was Thursday night before they decided to fix the boiler!!! There were problems with the heater, they sent someone up to fix it, it never really worked. We didn't bother calling them again because it wasn't like we were freezing at night. The WORST was the lack of housekeeping services for us. We made the mistake of deciding to go \"green\" during check in. When we changed our minds the next morning, we were told that housekeeping service would be provided for sure. We get back to the hotel at night, no housekeeping. Next morning, early morning, we go down to front desk and ask for housekeeping service again and informed them that they never came the day earlier. Once again, we were told that for sure housekeeping would stop by. In the end, we complained again that third night with zero housekeeping services and they kindly gave me thousands of SPG reward points.

That being said, the renovations were for the most part not an issue. There are two points that you should be aware of: there is a lobby bar/deli counter instead of an actual bar or restaurant. This isn't a big deal because there are dozens of great bars and restaurants very close to the hotel. The other problem I faced is with the hot water. They had just replaced the hot water boiler/heater and air bubbles in the hot water lines would disrupt the flow of hot water to my shower. The problem seemed to be transient and there wasn't really anything the engineers could do to fix it, but a couple of showers where you lose hot water mid-shower is quite annoying. Others have posted complaints about the noise of renovation. It did not bother me, but I was out of the room most of the day. Other than that, the hotel was decent. I requested a room that would be quiet at night and was given a room at the end of the hall (thank you!). I could hear people in the stairwell, but that was very unusual. The room was comfortable, clean, and fairly large. Noise isolation was mixed. I could hear toilets flushing and some street noise (on the 9th floor), but I didn't hear conversations or TV from neighboring rooms. I didn't hear the trains, trolley, and only heard one plane (the airport is not very far). Location is excellent, it's adjacent to Horton Plaza, the large downtown mall and the Gaslamp Quater. It's a 10 minute walk to the convention center and also has easy access to the trolley and train station. I didn't have a car, but I understand that parking is quite expensive. I really like the \"green choice\" option. $5 or 500 points for each day I don't use housekeeping. Considering I rarely need housekeeping when I'm traveling alone, this is a nice benefit for me and the hotel. I didn't use the pool or gym, so I cannot comment on either. Nice touches: available outlets on the desk and at the bedside. Little things done wrong: 1) ethernet cable was woefully short; I had to move the computer to the back of the desk to connect it. Yes, there is WiFi, but when wired is available, I prefer it because it is faster and more secure. 2) The alarm clock does not support mp3/ipods.

The one stars from me are extremely rare and only when I note egregious problems. I certainly found those right here at the Westin. I stayed here for five nights and had the absolute worst experience ever in a hotel. Let me preface this by saying my review is NOT about the issues surrounding construction. I'll hit on those, but the problems went far deeper than that. For starters, due to the heavy construction, you can't even enter the hotel from the main street. They could keep the main entrance open but decided to put a sign in front blocking guests from entering the easy way. After driving around for an extra 15 minutes, I finally found the secret entrance and could squeeze into the very narrow way. Upon checking into my room, I noticed a nice white robe hanging up in my bathroom. Upon closer inspection I saw a blood stain on it! I've included a photo here in my review. I don't use hotel robes anyway but it was unnerving seeing it there. I decided to leave it up for the entire week to see if the cleaning staff would notice and remove it. They didn't. It gets worse. The climate control in room was well, out of control. It was so hot I literally had to flip my pillow over in the night so I wouldn't be laying on a wet pillow. Gross but true. The front desk blamed it on construction but the thermostat wouldn't let me turn the setting below 65 degrees. I think that was the problem, not the construction. But okay, while we're on construction, the worst part of that involved the elevators. First, you had to walk a long, loud maze of dusty construction just to get to them. And two out of four were completely down and you had to wait in long lines just to jam into one like a sardine. In the mornings, when I wanted to go downstairs, I had to take the elevator up to the top floor to get into a short line and ride it down. Otherwise, the elevator would be too full by the time it got to me and have to pass me by. It gets worse. One day, for no apparent reason, the cleaning staff completely missed my room. I did not have the Do Not Disturb sign up or anything, they just missed me. I went down personally to let the front desk know. They apologized and said they'd make sure it got clean tomorrow. Well thanks a lot. That doesn't do me much good now. Did I mention they charge for WiFi? Something else I found odd was that the remote control to my TV had apparently been used so much that all of the numbers except the 5 were completely worn off (see photo). Now my TV at home gets used a lot more every day than a hotel remote possibly could and my numbers are not worn off. This is just another indication of the lack of attention to detail I consistently saw here. Upon check out, the lady asked how my visit went. I told her it was rough. She blamed it on the construction. Nothing more. No apology. Nothing. I was extremely disappointed in the multiple problems I encountered. Most concerning to me was the hotel staff's reluctance to try to do anything at all about it. An offer, some points, a free future stay once construction is complete, a bottle of champagne, a plate of cookies - anything would have been a nice gesture. But nothing at all was offered at any time despite these issues. What's funny is I'm usually a Marriott point person and try to stay in Marriotts whenever I travel (as you'll see in my reviews). This time I decided to change things up a bit and give a Westin a try. I'm very sorry that I did. Marriott?

You have to enter through a side door. I get in and there is one person running the desk with two customers in front of me. It took 20 minutes before I made it to the desk. The poor girl is ringing the little white buzzer behind her to get another person to help out, which happens right when I make it to the counter. The girl finds my reservation, and tries to run my card, but it wont read. Nothing wrong with the card, but it just says her computer cant read the card. She calls some number to find out what is wrong and after 20 minutes, she comes back and says, she's still on hold, and asked if I had another card. I told her I need to put it on my company card, and that I just used the card so i know it's not the card, so she goes back and tries the phone again....still nothing. In the mean time, the guy next to me checks in 5 people!! Finally I told her to just run my personal card. I don't blame her, I actually felt bad for her, I blame the computer system that would not read the card. I thought that after all the trouble they would give me a room with an ocean view, but no, they gave me a view of the ongoing construction. I get to the room (829), and it was pretty beat up. The pocket door to the bathroom was almost impossible to close (I have arthritis) because it was scraping against some internal mechanism. The wood at the bottom of the sink assembly was all banged up. The klinex box had one tissue in it, the TV remote barely worked, and the area around the lamp was not vacuumed. I head to my meeting and get back around 4:30 PM. I try to take a quick nap, and a few minutes later, I wake up to a bunch of loud noise coming from outside my window. I look down and see a bunch of union construction people yelling to loud banging music, for TWO HOURS. I go back to my meeting and out to dinner. I get back and try to go to sleep. Somewhere on my floor, there is a door that is closing and every time it does, it shakes my bed. It wakes me several times. The lights are on a motion sensor, and they continually pick up my feet moving in the bed, and they go on, keeping me up. I slept very little. The morning greets me at 7:00 AM with more union people yelling SCABS go home. I look out the window and they are already starting construction. They say that construction does not start until 8:00 AM, but it started, right below my window at 7. They have a program where you get $5 credit if you ask them not to change the sheets. I put out the card, but they never gave me anything. The elevators were slow and always full. There are 4 of them but I don't think 2 were running.

The primary purpose was to attend a meeting (which was taking place in this hotel) so I had booked the hotel on that basis. I had not reviewed the tripadvisor review prior to the booking. Here are findings: a. The hotel is going through some renovation on ground facility so it is difficult to go through in and out. Not sure how long this construction will last. b. After check-in I saw a cockroach (literally 1 1/2\" long) -- near elevator (close to their check-in desk). I pulled their staff and showed. Instead of taking care of this pest, the reaction from their employee is that this is to be expected as the hotel is in downtown. (From my standpoint, this is sorry excuse and from that point on, I was concerned of what to expect at this facility.) c. The hotel is wired for wi-fi; however, the reception is not always good -- depending upon the location. d. The fees for Wi-Fi is expensive (almost $60 for one week). Also you can't use wi-fi on your mobile device (such as iPhone or iPad) along with your personal computer. It allows you to access Internet on one or the other but no both. e. The room was OK; however, the ironing board in the room is very small and when expanded, it only reaches 3\" ft height so you better bend in order to use it. f. The TV and supported channels -- basic cable. For class of this hotel, I would have expected more. Certainly they were pushing for on-demand movies and adult entertainment programs. g. Housekeeping stuff -- ought to be reminded -- as they kept forgetting soap for shower or facial washing I used their gym and the facility was OK. You can watch TV while excercising on many equipments. However, you can't change the channel so unless you content to watch CNN all times, you will be disappointed. Had attended meetings in the hotel and the meeting rooms were OK. We had breakfast served in the meeting rooms and I am not sure how it may compare with standard breakfast served in their restaurent. The best part of the hotel was that it was close to other dining places within walking distance and you have lot of choices for dinner.

I arrived late one evening by taxi from the airport and had to be clear with the taxi driver which Westin I wanted to go to. On arrival the receptionist looked as if he was from Japan or maybe Korea and at first I had trouble understanding his English, or maybe he had trouble understanding mine, but we worked our way through the process. I had a nice room on the 8th floor overlooking the outdoor pool. (I never saw anyone using it.) I had some misgivings about the noise mentioned in other reports here. I can only say that I was never disturbed by any of the renovation work throughout my stay. The following morning I picked up a free paper from the reception area and on the combined advice of the two women receptionists who recommended various places, went off for breakfast. There are lots of places to eat within easy walking distance in this downtown area and the gaslamp district. In the room there was a coffee and tea making machine and a free bottle of water, which is a nice touch. My bedroom was a good size, comfortable and the room was immaculately cleaned every day. Whoever they employ for housekeeping is doing a great job and I hope they pay them well. There seemed to be frequent conferences held on the second floor. This was only marginally a problem when waiting in the morning for one of the 4 lifts. The choice of TV channels is amazing, although more from outside the USA for visitors from abroad would be a nice touch. (Europe, Chine, Arabia, etc.) The location is excellent easily walkable to USS Midway and other tourist sites, or the No 7 bus up to Balboa Park and the museums there. I usually walked down from the park to the hotel during the December Lights weekend, it was quicker and easy. There is a supermarket round the back a block or so away, if you want fresh fruit, or different drinks in your bedroom. The Horton mall next door was a bit of a disappointment, although much of the rest of architecture is both modern and stylish in San Diego. I have two minor quibbles. While the shower was excellent, I had asked for a bath (I know its a European habit, but I like to mull things over while sitting in hot water.) I had the impression from some of the photos on the hotel site that this was possible, but perhaps they were all in use. My bigger gripe is over the cost of using the internet. A two day use was charged at the same rate I pay for a month of high-speed broadband. The answer is that there are at least three branches of Starbucks within 10 minutes walk of the hotel, one of them near the entrance to the shopping mall next door to the hotel. For the price of a cup of coffee you can get on-line for free. Elsewhere in San Diego, it was possible to get on-line for free, but it does not cover the whole city. With the above minor caveat I would recommend this great hotel as an ideal spot for a visitor to use as his base, although be aware that outside on the streets there are always a few homeless people. I never felt threatened by any of them and when they asked for money it was always done very politely, regardless of whether I gave something, or not.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel & Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Nic7585", "ReviewID": "UR121595259", "Content": "This Hotel was so convenient.

I think it just stems from my belief that most hotels are overpriced, and the \"luxury\" hotels often charge for all their flash but sacrifice important substance, like vital room features (comfort, amenities, etc.). Have you noticed some restaurants do this too? They are all too happy to charge you $100+ for a tasteless, skimpy meal, in the name of their trendy atmosphere. Priorities sometimes get mixed up! That's a little how I felt for the one night I stayed at the Westin Gaslamp Quarter in San Diego, CA. Here is my review in a supposed nutshell: Positives: I was on the 12th floor, which had a wonderful view of the skyline (especially at night), and the room's windows (which do crack open for fresh air) were large and attractively dressed, with drapes and scroll-down shades. The furniture, including a dark wood desk and bar area above the fridge, was clean and comfy and well-made. The room had a fairly large plasma style TV, but I did not turn it on. The shower was spacious with one of those new style curving curtains, a head that flowed well, a drain that did not clog, and high quality soap and shampoo. I also was impressed with the bathroom mirror, which had a florescent light built into the back--giving a mellow, romantic, yet well-lit glow around its frame, like a solar eclipse. The negatives: The woman at the check-in counter had some communication and customer service disabilities that forced me to use my diplomacy and communication talents when my colleague was getting frustrated over a room charge concern that she did not know how to handle, so a manager had to take over before it was resolved. The bathroom did not have a fan! Hello? Four star hotel? The bathroom sink also had low water pressure. I realize it's the 12th floor, but please solve this at some point. The fridge was extremely small and built into the console style bar with a large wood door, so every time you needed to get into the fridge you had to open this large wood door and then the fridge door. Kind of inconvenient and retarded, if you ask me. It's funny how luxury places also like to nickel and dime you for all the \"extras.\" The small spring water bottle sitting atop the bar that looks complimentary and should be, is a mere $5 my friend. Sitting next to the bottle is the typical price list for all the overpriced snacks and drinks offered by many hotels that are supposed to be in the fridge, but we not in this case--nothing else was to be found.

Asked again to see if there is any (we were traveling with 2 little kids and connecting rooms were essential), and we were told that there is none available. So we took 2 rooms right next to each other on the 9th floor and as soon as we got off from the elevator on the 9th, it smelled like someone has been smoking on the floor for hours. It was so bad. We got into our room and noticed the smell was leaking into our room, so we called Service Exp. and asked for a room change. We were then told that there is a connecting room and were told that someone is bein sent with new sets of keys. We waited for about good 20 minutes and no one came. I decided to just go down to the front rest and get new keys myself and I did. This lady at the front was exceptionally friendly and helpful unlike the guy who checked us in. We went to our new connecting room on 5th floor and we were waiting for a baby crib which we have requested. Good 20 minutes passed and no one came. Called the front and they didn't know about the crib request so they made a request for us. After all this stressful hassle, realized that check in and settling down took us about 2 and a half painful hours. And then later in the evening, we discovered that the heater in one of our rooms were not working. Someone was sent to fix it but it still didn't work. Called the front again and were informed that they don't have parts to get it fixed, and they can give us more blankets. Okay, I've had it up to my head and didn't wanted to let all the troubles get to me, but this is just down right ridiculous. Front staff asked if we want to move to a different room, but we were also told that connecting rooms are all taken. Since we were traveling with little kids we needed connecting rooms and working ac/heating, so I have asked if they have a portable heater for us to use, and they said no. Asked again if there's anything the hotel can do to get this situation corrected, and I was told \"no\". I understand sometimes things go wrong and few makes mistakes but there's no excuse for not doing the best to have issues resolved.

There was couple things that we did not like, but it wasn't anything to get mad about. Here we go: Checking In: After a overnight flight from Honolulu, we arrived at the hotel at about 10:00 a.m. We took the Super Shuttle from the airport and it took about 15 minutes from the airport to the hotel (The time included dropping some passengers at other hotels). As other reviewers have said, make sure you inform the driver that you want to go to the Westin next to Horton Shopping mall because there are two Westin's in San Diego. Checking in was a breeze, even though we got in a little early, our room was ready. From the minute we arrived at the hotel, everyone from the valets, the doorperson, the people at the front desk always welcomed you. The person helping us informed we were on a room on the 4th floor. I was hoping to be in a room a little higher, but I did not mention anything. Room: The room we had was right near the elevator. Surprisingly, it was not the noisy at night from the other guests walking by. The room was pretty spacious considering the hotel is in the downtown district. There is a little dorm size refrigerator and a work desk, plus a sofa. The bed was very good, I guess you could say it was \"Heavenly\". Location: The Westin is in a perfect location (to me). It is located right next door to Horton Shopping Plaza where there are quite a few number of stores and food court restaurants. Yes, the layout is a little different compared to other regular malls, but once you know where to go, it is pretty easy. There is a CVS on the very ground floor and a Starbucks if you need to get any items for the room. On the other side of the mall, right across Nordstrom is a pretty big size Ralphs Market. My wife and I bought some drinks and food because the Westin does not offer a complimentary breakfast. On the opposite side of the mall is 4th street and this is the edge of the Gaslamp District. This area goes on 4th, 5th, and 6th street and this is where a lot of restaurant, bars, and other stores are located. Since the hotel is not located right on the Gaslamp District, I did not hear any of the noise from this area. The convention center and Petco Park is located about a 15 minute walk. If you do not want to walk, the public trolley has a stop about a block over and the trolley will take you all over San Diego. Restaurants: There was couple restaurants (I did not go into any of them) and there is a lounge right off the lobby. Pool & Exercise Room: The person at the front desk said there is one, I did not check it out. Business Center: There are couple computers to use located in one of the restuarants. I noticed when the resturant was closed, the door was locked. If you wanted to use the computer after the restaurant closed, I'm not sure how this would be done. Negatives: Parking: To valet park (only option) was $32 per day. This was kind of high, so my wife and I only rented a car on our last night. We parked on the street, just make sure you read the signs because there are street cleaining on certain mornings. Internet access: The charge is $9.95 per 24 hour period. I wish this was included in the price of the room. There is free internet service in the lobby area. The internet service was adequate for what I was doing. Street work: On the last night, there was some street work right outside the hotel. We could hear a loud rumbling sound from about 11:00 pm to about 12:00 midnight. Not something you want to hear when you have to wake up at 3:00 am to catch a flight. This was the time when I wished the room was on a higher floor. Advice: Parking: The Horton Plaza Mall will validate your parking ticket, if you park in their garage, for 3 hours. You do not have to buy anything, you just have to find the parking valtidation machine. This is helpful especially if you don't pay for the hotel parking and you need to freshen up before leaving again at night. If you park overnight, the costs is about $60. Finding the Hotel: The Westin is located right next to the NBC and AT&T building. If you get lost, just look for one of these buildings and you will find the Westin. Overall, the Westin is a very good place to stay. With the exception of the high parking price, I highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chandler, AZ", "Title": "\u201cEmployee Janine at the Restaurant\u201d", "Author": "Cowgirlsofia", "ReviewID": "UR118713079", "Content": "Janine was everything we could have asked as a server.

I came to this hotel to celebrate my birthday weekend with my best friend. The room was booked and \"prepaid\" by a reputable travel agency. I received a confirmation email from Westin saying it was prepaid. When we checked in, the clerk confirmed again that the room was prepaid and just needed a credit card for \"incidentals.\" However when we went to check out 3 DAYS LATER, the front desk tried to charge my friend's credit card nearly $500 for the entire amount for the room. They claimed the credit card used to pay for the room was rejected and announced in front of several other hotel guests at the front desk that it was a \"stolen credit card.\" We assured them that a reputable travel agency backed by a huge bank in North America surely was not using a stolen credit card to book rooms. We were horrified by this treatment. I could not believe no problem about the prepaid room had been mentioned sooner. Instead, I was left to deal with this upon checkout on my birthday - forcing me to nearly miss my flight to Las Vegas to meet my husband. I finally got ahold of the travel agency, which assured me the room had indeed been paid. The travel agent asked to speak to the front desk clerk at the hotel. I handed over my cell phone to the clerk who took my phone to a back room, so the travel agent could speak to the \"supervisor\" on duty. Fifteen minutes later, this so-called \"supervisor\" emerged and said everything had been taken care of and the only charges that would appear on my friend's credit card would be for parking. My friend made it clear that parking would be the only charges she would authorize on her card. Finally, we managed to leave the hotel and I barely made my flight. Three days later, my friend checks her credit card statement and sees the Westin Gaslamp STILL charged $488 in room charges to her credit card. This was absolutely unbelievable to me. The last we heard from the \"supervisor\" at the hotel was that everything was fine. If something still went wrong after that point, someone should have called and notified me! Instead, they just went ahead and charged $488 in unauthorized charges to my friend's card. I called the travel agency back and they were HORRIFIED. They assured me that they had proof that the room had been paid for with the agency's credit card. They could not understand what the hotel was doing. After several calls to the accounting department at the hotel, the Westin Gaslamp finally reversed the charges to my friend's card. I never recieved any explanation or apology from hotel management. The hotel staff was completely inept and unprofessional. I have always loved Westin hotels. That is why I chose to celebrate my birthday weekend at this Westin. However, after this experience I may never return to a Westin again.

But -- I needn't have worried. Everything was fine. We asked for a quiet room. We got one on the 11th floor which was quite quiet, after 10 PM. (It was on the side of the building with the outdoor pool, which is open till 10.) The walls were thick enough so we didn't hear our neighbors. The room had been recently renovated, so everything was new, including the mattresses. (The renovation killed one of the phone lines, according to hotel maintenance, but the other phone in the room worked.) There are 4 elevators so there was never much of a wait. Our room was in an L-shape, with a desk in the L-part. A mini-fridge was large enough to stock some groceries we bought at the 24/7 Ralphs supermarket around the corner. The location is great for tourists. It's right by the Gaslamp district, which is home to San Diego's major restaurant/nightlife district. San Diego has an excellent public transportation system and the Westin Gaslamp is right on several major lines, making Balboa Park/Zoo, Hillcrest, and Little Italy easily to get to. (Don't confuse the Westin Gaslamp with the Westin Hotel on Broadway, a few blocks away.) The waterfront is within walking distrance -- about 6 short blocks. We didn't have a car -- parking in this area is very expensive -- but we found we didn't need it to get around, though admittedly getting out to La Jolla might have been a bear if we hadn't taken a tour. Quick shopping is easy: there's a CVS on the block and a mall behind the hotel, besides Ralphs around the block. Internet access was $9.95/night. We screwed up the access by connecting our Kindles to the system while our laptop was also connected. (Apparently if you have more than 1 device, you should notify them first.) After the issue was resolved, they comp'd the Internet charge for the entire time. That was a really nice thing to do on their part. The staff was very friendly -- housekeeping, front desk, concierge, bellhops.... Downsides: the bedsheets were not soft, there's no soda machine in the building, and there's no microwave.

I had 3 people on my floor ask me \"Do you know where I find the elevator?\" The overall appearance of the hotel is that it is not kept clean. The carpets need to be vacuumed more often. There is an effort to keep the hotel \"green\" by giving you Starwood points in exchange for no daily maid service. This worked for us but the entire place looked like regular cleaning had been cut back. The pool was not very clean: I kept encountering human hair during my 7am swim. Does the filter not work? The staff is quite attentive when you ask. \"Carina\" at the desk answered all my questions about my reservation but the concierge was clueless. She also said she was \"out of maps.\" Duh.

I'm pretty sure the cleaning staff just did a quick pick-up instead of actually cleaning it.

For a hotel to brag about how they're always booked, they need to get more elevators going! The front desk staff aren't very knowledgeable if you're asking about where and how to get somewhere. The valet or bellhop was more helpful. And lastly, because they were booked solid, the hotel was loud with tons of kids running around like they haven't been out of the house in weeks. The staff basically said \"You're just going to have to deal with it even after hours.\" Here's some tips if you do decide to stay here: The Broadway Pier (that hosts the harbor cruise tours and Coronado Ferry) is definitely walking distance regardless of what front desk says.
