We stayed at the Double Tree. The staff was very pleasant and responsive to our requests. We had no problems with the workings of the hotel. Also Double Tree provides easy access to the French Quarter, Bourbon Street and the Superdome which made it a good choice for our trip. Harraha and the Aquarium of the Americas are also very close. I must address the condition or the hotel, however. This location is certainly in need of some renovations. Peeling paint, wall cracks, mold in the shower and moldy smelling carpets all led me to one conclusion. While I was not unhappy with the hotel in general, better hotels are available in New Orleans in this price range in locations that are at least as good.

We stayed for seven nights from 8/11/12 to 8/18/12. It was across the street from the start of the French Quarter, about a five minute walk from Bourbon Street, across the street from the Canal Street streetcar and an upscale shopping mall with an equally upscale movie theater, and literally steps (about 50) away from Harrah's Casino. The streetcar stop being right in front of the hotel was a huge convenience as we took the streetcars every day (buy the $3 pp all day pass - you'll need exact change, but a $5 and a $1 will do). We absolutely loved the location of this hotel. It couldn't have been better. The front desk staff was very friendly and greeted us every day. The room was quiet and very well appointed, but a bit small. It is a downtown hotel after all so this is to be expected. Besides, we spent very little time in the room during our stay. As other have said, the bathroom was small, but manageable. There was a full length mirror just outside the bathroom and the hair dryer cord reached it so two people could get ready at the same time with a little planning. Our only complaint was a musty/mildew smell that happened about day three (the only reason I didn't give the hotel 5 stars). We asked the housekeeper to spray a room deodorant each day and that kept the smell at bay for the rest of our trip. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable (among the best we have ever had in a hotel) and the bed linens were of high quality.

The room was a great example of a Doubletree- nice bed and linens, fine high def tv and clean. For some reason the counter in the bathroom was so low that I almost had to kneel to shave in the morning. (I am 6' 2\" tall). The major downside to this hotel is the noise level at night- rowdy tourists in the hallway, ice machines, surrounding rooms. The building itself seems dated and is not well sound insulated. The fourth floor is also the pool deck which is much more popular with smokers than swimmers. More foot traffic through the night.

You have to beg to keep your drinks filled, the prices are high, and the portions are small ( for comparative pricing). The breakfast buffet was less than average and costed $42 for TWO people. Trying to get your car during a busy check out time is a headache. They are either slow to get your car or extremely rude. The person who was helping with valet had our car pulled up, but then couldn't find our keys. He was really rude to me about it-- like it was my problem. I understand that he was probably busy, but that is never reason to be rude to a paying customer. The valet costs about $35 after tax and there are no other parking options. This price is the highest I've ever seen valet in cities, and to be so high, you would expect SUPERB service.... but you get exactly opposite. The only highlight of this trip was the guy who loaded our bags while we were leaving. He was so nice. Unfortunately that did not make up for the bad, dishonest, unhelpful, and overpriced service for the rest of our stay. Double Tree should drop their name from this hotel QUICK. It is bad for their name and is not somewhere I would return to. It is in the hotel district, and there are several others that are closer and much nicer for comparable prices. The Westin is across the street and when I visited a friend inside--- seemed like a much better place.

I've had generally good experiences, even when the facilities themselves were below expectations. But this has changed my mind on them. In fact, I deliberately passed up a Doubletree for a trip I'm taking this coming weekend because of the experience here. What's been especially disappointing is the lack of a management response. I made three attempts to relay the issues I experienced during my stay, once through an email through Hilton's web site, once through the satisfaction survey that was sent out, and once in a phone conversation with the hotel's financial staff. I never received a response, so I have little recourse but to post an honest review. The first issue I had was actually contacting the hotel in the first place. The number displayed on the property's web site (and on TripAdvisor) leads to an automated answer with two options: \"1\" for reservations and \"2\" for all other calls. \"2\" takes you to a \"The person is not available\" message and immediately hangs up on you. \"1\" takes you to Doubletree's call center in the Philippines. I went that route twice in attempting to connect directly with the hotel. The first time, the agent was reluctant and somewhat argumentative, and I had to ask four times to be connected to the hotel. The second time, I relayed my issue and was cold transferred to the hotel's financial office (the agent never said \"I'll transfer you\"), resulting in an awkward connection. So this was all very frustrating. We had a reservation for six nights. Maybe I was supposed to slip the manager who checked me in a $20, but we got a room directly adjacent to the elevator block, which included the service elevator. Not only was it excessively noisy both during the night and in the morning, but it also resulted in no privacy from the one, small window, as it was on a corner and faced the public hallway by the elevators. I felt that we should have been given a room in a better location given the length of the stay. There were two maintenance issues with the room, one of which was the air-conditioner blowing constantly regardless of the temperature, resulting in a perpetually cold room. I complained twice about this and it was never fixed. I know they came at least once, because the other issue was resolved, but I never received any follow-up as to whether or not these issues were resolved or even looked at. I expected a quick phone call, at least, or even a note. We had a somewhat complex scenario where the reservation was to be in my name with me checking in, but on my wife's credit card with my wife checking out, with a bill in my wife's name. I felt that, as a business hotel, they should be able to handle this. I attempted to arrange this ahead of time with the management, and was able to check in. However, the evening before my wife checked out (June 6), she attempted to talk to the manager on duty and found her to be unhelpful and unwilling to deal with the situation. She returned the next day to find the same manager, and the same attitude. This resulted in me having to call the hotel and attempt to fix the problem myself after she checked out. As far as I'm concerned, I should not have had to call them. When I got on the elevator sometimes, I would press the floor, the door would close, but the car would not move. This happened to me four times, and I feel bad for anyone who's claustrophobic, as I'm sure this would be terrifying for them. The only way you could get it to move is by pressing the door open button, then the floor button again. Overall though, the room was clean, well laid out and the decor was modern and nice. The staff were generally nice, the lobby was very attractive and I enjoyed the cafe downstairs (although I didn't eat there). The location also is excellent. We had stayed at another hotel on Canal the previous year and had constant issues with street noise despite being on the top floor. Our room here was quiet, even though the pool was directly below us. However I would not stay here again and would discourage anyone from doing so. This is well below Doubletree standards and, for what you pay here, there are much, much better hotels in the CBD and even on Canal Street itself, including several Hilton family properties. It would be in anyone's best interest to go another route.", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Providence, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cNever Again\u201d", "Author": "Bill S", "ReviewID": "UR131881844", "Content": "The staff was very friendly and the location is great I must say that.

After reading some reviews before departing for the trip, I was less than thrilled. I will say that I experienced none of the issues that other reviewers have detailed. From the front desk staff to the restaurant to house keeping, the service was top notch and excellent - I couldn't have asked for better. It is obvious that the management at the property is placing a heavy focus on customer service. The business office worked with me to find a great meeting room, the front desk was very helpful on several fronts - from helping me find places to eat, to switching my room quickly (the first one smelled like smoke), to bringing supplies up to our meeting room, they were fantastic. I was also impressed with the staff at the restaurants who were very attentive and remembered me when I revisited. As an aside, I would recommend trying the 'Maple Street' blend of coffee from PJ's at the hotel. I did speak with the front desk manager to compliment him on the level of service I was experiencing. He was very nice and let me know that they have made some changes in the last 60 days in order to turn things around at the property - in my opinion, their efforts are succeeding brilliantly. I never did experience any issues with noise at the hotel - the doors on my floor all closed slowly without slamming shut. The rooms are small BUT are immaculately clean and the beds are comfortable - I slept very well during my stay there. Additionally, the hotel is less than a 10 minute walk from Bourbon Street and a 10 minute walk in the other direction to the convention center.

I had to stay at this hotel for a conference, and chose it over the Hilton because there was no additional charge quoted for using the fitness center. Be warned that the Doubletree's proximity to the convention center depends upon where in the center your meeting is located. If you're in any of the convention center rooms closest to the bridge, it's a little less than a mile walk, which can be rough with posters, etc., in the rain. The hotel looks nice but small on the inside... but once you get to the rooms, it's obvious that this place is here to serve a lot of the casino clientele. Upon check-in at the Doubletree they were nice enough to give me free internet as a Hilton HHonors Silver member. Of course, the speed is so slow and spotty throughout the room (even when staying still) that I'd be very upset if I was paying the $13/day our conference was originally quoted for internet access. The bathrooms are TINY - I'm not a large person, but at six months pregnant I find it difficult to maneuver in there (if the counter wasn't as low as it is I'd be unable to turn around with the door open). There are some tiles missing around the baseboards in the bathroom, and the daily housekeeping has been hit or miss. And the walls are PAPER THIN.

I suppose I should be thankful that he's getting his evening call out of the way before 3 am this time.

We saw some public car parks nearby offering overnight parking at $20 per night, but weren't confident that they were safe, so begrudgingly paid the $60 for two nights. Checkin was friendly and helpful, and it was nice to get a free cookie (the only thing you get for free in the hotel). The room was reasonably appointed, but no fridge or microwave. A flat screen TV was included, with good selection of channels. Pay per view movies and games were available for extra charges. The hotel has wi-fi, but unlike the other two hotels we stayed in, this one charges $10 a day to use it. This seems a bit shoddy for a hotel these days, and goes with the general theme of never missing an opportunity of slapping on extra charges. Breakfast is an optional, chargeable extra. No free coffee unlike other hotels. Even the vending machines charged an very expensive $2 for a small bottle of water. We found that the shower wouldn't supply hot water for more than one minute at a time, sometimes not at all.

We didn't stay here for the amenities, such as the pool, because we haven't been in New Orleans during the warm season, but we love the location of the hotel. It's within walking distance to Bourbon Street (10 minutes in one direction) and to the French Quarter (10 minutes in the other direction). The neighborhood is quiet and is close to corner stores for late night runs for water and juice (a necessity after a day of drinking in NOLA). The hotel is across the street from a pretty nice Harrah casino (better than Atlantic City, but not as flashy as Las Vegas), which has table games (blackjack, poker) and lots of slot machines. Perhaps more importantly, a Starbucks in the casino for the early morning coffee and a Fuddruckers with very tasty burgers for late night \"snack\". The first time we stayed at this hotel, we had a room facing the casino and the second time we stayed at this hotel, our room faced the back and it may be just room 410 that we were in, but it seems to me that the layout of the rooms make those rooms facing the casino to be larger. Also, and again it may be just room 410, but the back-facing room has got really loud pipes so that everytime someone take a shower or go to the bathroom in the rooms next door or above our room, we hear the water movements. We wished we had asked for another room during our stay this time. Also, whoever is in charge of cleaning the 4th floor rooms don't do a very good job of cleaning, because for 2 days in a row, our rooms failed to be cleaned. The first time, we arrived too late in our room to do anything about it (11 pm), but the second time, we told the concierge at 11 am that we needed a cleaning, but when we came back at 4 pm, our room was still not done. We called the front desk and they were responsive enough to send a cleaning lady over with fresh towels, but didn't tell the lady that we needed our room cleaned so she wasn't in a very good mood when we told her that we needed more than towels.

The clock was the correct time, and when the time changed from daylight savings to standard during my stay, they not only put a reminder card on the bed, but they changed the time for me. No free breakfast, but the Harrah's Casino is immediately accross the street and they have a huge breakfast / lunch buffet for only $11.99. The conscierge was very friendly and remembered my name. I didn't have to order anything from him, but I did give him a nice tip at the end for holding my bag. I received a free fresh chocolate cookie on check-in. I asked for one on another night and received another. Elevators were fast. Front desk staff very friendly. The location is just a short walk to the Riverwalk waterfront mall - which is huge with a great food fair. There is also a high end (Sak's 5th Ave) shopping center kitty corner. The very tourist oriented French Quarter waterfront walk is also just across the street, and the entire French Quarter including the lively Bourbon Street is within very close walking distance.

I also was assigned a room with two queens instead of the king I had booked. The staff were generally pleasant, although some seemed more interested in flirting with each other than assisting guests. I had a terrible experience in the restaurant at breakfast my last day there, the manager comped the check as a result.

A huge gripe--the outlets built into the lamps (the only ones readily accessible in the room) don't accomodate a standard cell phone charger. The bathroom was sufficient but could have used better lighting and a makeup mirror. Not sure why hotels don't provide these small things to better accomodate the growing number of female business travelers... The towels were standard, amenities were nothing special. Iron and board in closet, but have fun trying to figure out where to set it up with enough light to actually see what you are doing and an available outlet nearby--I ultimately stuck it half in and half out of the bathroom.

Prior to that I had read some of the online reviews regarding this hotel. Here is my take on this hotel. There are pros and cons to this hotel. The pros are the location, the price for the value, and the service. The cons are the washroom size, and the valet parking. My wife, daughter, and myself plus my sister in law shared a room with two double beds. We had enough space in the room for us, plus our daughters \"pack-n-play\" (portable crib for those who don't know). Was the room large...nope. Was it small...nope. Was it adequate...you bet. Beds were comfortable. We could move around. Nice view of the river and casino. It's a typical hotel room in my opinion. Let's get to the cons. Every review on here has stated that the bathroom size is small. I can attest to that. They are small. But then how much time are you spending in the bathroom. I am 6'4\" and was able to shower, shave, clean up, and \"go potty\" as my little girl says. So don't worry much about this. But it is a con if you are looking for a more spacious bathroom. The other con was the valet parking. $30 per night. Not cheap. And the closest public parking is not that close either. I had intended to use public parking (or hoped). I even asked when I pulled up where it was. The valet wasn't too helpful. Which I expected because otherwise how does he get paid? They were attentive though if you used the service. And you can get your car whenever you needed it....quickly. And it is secure. But still...the price is steep in my opinion and the hotel would be wise to let patrons know what other options are available. The pros. The first and most important pro for me was the service. Nothing short of excellent. The staff was attentive, friendly, quick. If we had an issue, they resolved it. If we had a comment, it was gladly accepted. They smile and say hello and goodbye. They offer suggestions when you need it. Couldn't have asked for a better group of people. If I worked for Doubletree, I would use them as an example of how to treat guests. 2nd pro (always an important one) was the price. Great value! It's not cheap by other \"motel\" standards. Remember you are right downtown. But given the location and ammenities, the price was right. 3rd pro is the location. When you can walk out of the hotel and cross the street to the french quarter...well it doesn't get better than that. We toured the french quarter on foot, as well as jumped on a street car to head to other areas of the city. Street car stops are right in front of the hotel. And if you want to gamble, Harrah's is right across the street as well. Anyway...there you have my review. Take it for what it's worth. I would definately stay here again.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, FL", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "Jgonzo23", "ReviewID": "UR117233972", "Content": "We stayed at this Hotel and although the decor is a bit dated, the staff does a nice job of maintaining its overall appearance.

We've always stayed at Doubletree hotels in other states so we picked this one based on their pretty solid reputation. We used their valet which is $30 per night. The valet guys were friendly and helpful & really mde an effort to engage us in conversation. Check in was easy, we arrived 3 hrs before check in time and were able to check our baggage while we walked around waiting for the room to be ready. My husband had requested a room with a river view & the lady winked & said I'll try. We were called 30 minutes later, room was ready. The room was clean and either we were lucky to have gotten an upgraded room or they have upgraded them all since prior reviews. The bed was a king and the furniture was new & nice. It was small but in New Orleans who stays in their room all day/night? The TV was a large flat screen and worked well. The a/c was efficient and kept the room nice & cool. The room was said to be no smoking but the smell was there. So we checked for bedbugs (I hope everyone does this!!) found all to be ok, dropped our bags and off we went to find lunch. We cme back at 4pm to nap before our evening outings . We were almost asleep and WHOOOOSHHH,Bang,clack, WHoooosh. Neighbor has flushed the toilet. It was an enormous noise that scared the stew out of us. Then we realized that we could hear every single word the people next to us and across from us spoke. Yes, even the people across the hall because there's about an inch of space under each door and every sound, even a whisper travels right into the rooms. They weren't yelling or being obnoxious there is just NO sound proofing around the doors or between walls. It literally sounds as if someone is in the room with you. We did the best we could and had a great time out. The a/c was wet and moldy and caused the whole room and linens to be damp. We were out late & up early but sleep is impossible past 6am because of the extreme noise situation. My suggestion would be to try hard not to get a room that has an adjacent room with the metal doors and attempt to get away from the elevator or get a corner room and try for a floor that isn't occupied heavily.

I did have work to do on Sunday and needed to get an early start. First, PARKING. If you have car, parking in the area is atrocious. The hotel has VALET ONLY and it's $30 per night. The desk agent and valet guys recommended parking at Harrah's or the Shops at Canal. If you gamble for 30 consecutive minutes and you have a player's card at Harrah's, you get your parking validated. I was in the casino for over an hour and somehow only registered 15 minutes of playing time. I will not tell you how much money I lost. I gave up on getting my parking validated and decided I'd pay my way out. The casino parking also charges $30 and they only accept cash. I attempted to find parking on the street with no luck and resorted back to the hotel valet. The front desk staff and everyone else that I encountered was great. They were very hospitable and welcoming. The agent at the desk offered me several cookies, even though I clearly didn't need them. The room was very small. The bathroom was even smaller. I had a hard time getting my suit case in the door. The walls were thin and allowed for a lot of noise to penetrate the room. The air conditioner was noisy and rattled the ceiling tiles all night. There were also people milling around in the hallway ALL night. Once I got to sleep it wasn't an issue, but it took me a while to get there. I had a complimentary breakfast coupon which usually entitles you to a free breakfast buffet at the Doubletree. At this location, it entitled me to a free cold breakfast. Not sure what that's all about, but this property seems to nickel and dime you. I determined that this hotel wasn't right for me. I canceled my reservations for the next three nights and moved to the Doubletree by the airport. There's free parking, peace and quiet, and more room there.

Starting with our check-in through our check out, we had several problems. LOCATION - next door to Harrahs Casino, a few blocks from Burboun Street - Great location. This is the only thing \"great\" about this hotel and experience. Oh yeah, and they have a Frozen Yogurt chain at its front door. :) CHECK-IN - arrived at 1pm, room not ready, went to gym in the meantime, which was small but clean and decent. We were called about an hour and a half later, and when I picked up my keys, we were not offered a cookie (as DoubleTree takes pride in this) and we did not receive our coupons for the \"Romance Package\" we had booked (per the website, this includes breakfast in bed every morning of our stay, a free bottle of champagne, and free access to the gym, which was FREE ANYWAYS!!!!!) CLEANLINESS - AWFUL! Our shower curtain smelled horrible (indescribable) and our comforter had a huge yellow stain on it (???urine? hopefully juice?) which was only discovered after a night of sleeping on it. I have a picture for proof if anyone is interested to see how obvious it was. I asked to get the shower curtain changed TWICE before someone actually came up to change it. The only upside to the TINY bathroom is the drain actually worked and didn't clog up on us like when we stayed at another unnamed hotel down the street. My boyfriend also found some sort of cricket or roach crawling up his leg when we were on our way out of our room!!!!! VALUE - for the $15 more per night extra that we paid for the \"Romance Package\" I would say it was definitely not worth it. Might as well eat breakfast around the hotel somewhere close by. Otherwise, the room rates were comparable to the surrounding hotels. ROOMS- as mentioned above, the room was very small. JUST ENOUGH room around the single queen bed for one couple, but I wouldn't recommend more than 2 people to this sized room. And I usually am able to squeeze!!! Bathroom was even smaller - You could be standing on the toilet and reach your arms to touch practically all four walls in the bathroom, not to mention the door would open up and bump your legs if you were sitting on it. Sleep quality was not good- pillows were not comfortable (and not even resembling real pillows, just mush covered with a pillowcase?) and the 2 bedsheets with the (soiled) comforter still kept me waking up cold in the middle of the night. SERVICE - Room service was 20 plus minutes late on the first morning - orderd it at 10am, and so we decided to leave at 10:20 am when breakfast hadn't arrived yet. The only person that was actually great was the gentleman who held on to our bags and ordered us a cab to the airport when we needed to leave around 10:15am - we headed out to a local restaurant for breakfast (Mother's - down the street) instead of using our last breakfast coupon - cab was on time! Otherwise, service was sub-par - again, DoubleTree takes pride in their warm cookies and not ONE of the staff members offered it to us at anytime. Even the lady who made eye contact with us at the front desk who was HOLDING the tray of cookies!!! CHECK-OUT - to top off the experience, they mistakenly charged us room service for our \"Romance Package\" breakfasts. The gentleman at the counter was able to refund this charge, thank goodness.

We had the valet take our car for the first night of our stay - $30/day+tax before we discovered you can park at Harrah's Self-Park Garage 2 blocks away for free if you gamble for 30 minutes - well worth it if you can avoid losing more than $30 in 30 minutes every day you park. When we called down from our room to have the car ready, it was outside in 10 minutes. You can request your car as many times as you like within that 24-hour period. The cost was automatically added to our room account. No problems, so far... When we checked out, we find that we were charged for parking each night of our stay. WHAT?! They saw our car one day and charged us for four. We had to get a supervisor to come out to remove the extra charges on our bill because the front desk woman helping us wanted us to go outside to talk to the parking manager about the charges (are you kidding?! - we have to go out to explain and correct THEIR mistake?!) and she couldn't seem to correct the bill herself on the computer. Apparently, the guys parking cars for the Doubletree are their own entity. That makes me feel REAL safe about leaving a car with them. It was all resolved in the end and the supervisor was kind to refund us the first night's parking, but what a mess. -One night of our stay we were wakened around 5am by a toxic odor coming into our room. It was as if someone dumped 10 gallons of nail polish on our carpet. We called down several times and the final explanation we got in the morning was that a maintenance man was finishing the elevator doors on the 2nd floor. Somehow the off-gases made it to our room and could not escape. We stuck a towel under the door to try and prevent more from coming in and then put on the air. In retrospect, we should have requested to move to another room, but who can think straight at that hour after inhaling chemical fumes in your sleep? The manager explained that the man working with the chemical didn't have a mask on himself, so he wasn't concerned that it was toxic to be breathing in. Well, that sure makes me feel confident that we're not going to have respiratory problems or killed off some brain cells. He was kind to refund us one night's stay, but again, what a mess. -The continental breakfast had exceptional bacon! Totally random! One of the waitresses was not particularly friendly. One morning she seated us in the far corner of a connected room when there were plenty of seats open in the main room. I kindly asked if we could sit in the main room, and she mumbled something under her breath and walked away from me. I just stood there wondering what just happened. After that, we went to the main room and sat ourselves. Nice attitude, lady. -One night of our stay we had some really loud neighbors next to us squealing and talking loud. It was pretty clear they had been drinking. After calling the front desk several times over the course of an hour around midnight to get them to quiet down, someone finally contacted them and we finally were able to get to sleep. It shouldn't have taken that long. -Housekeeping was fantastic. We don't bother with getting our room made on trips. Housekeeping noticed our \"do not disturb\" sign on our door and called each day to ask if we needed anything. We were out of the room a lot and they managed to call us when they noticed we stepped in. They were at our door with whatever we needed within minutes. Very nice housekeeping staff. -The Wi-Fi was pretty bad. It would cut in and out a lot. If you pay extra, you could get \"upgraded\" Wi-Fi service. I've never heard of a hotel that offers a low-grade AND high-grade Wi-Fi service. Why don't they just toss out the crappy Wi-Fi and have better Wi-Fi for everyone? Very strange. -The hotel location was great if you're here for a conference at the nearby Hilton. Harrah's is across the street. The Riverwalk Marketplace, French Quarter, and Arts District are short walks away. We were happy to accept the day of free parking and one night's stay, but it was disappointing how some staff initially handled situations. It was a bizarre stay.

After booking the room, I started reading some very negative reviews about the Doubletree and actually tried to cancel my online reservation, but was not able to because we were within the 72 hour cancellation policy.

Our arrival and check in was a pretty easy and quick process. We went up to our room and tried to enter but our card keys would not work. I immediately started having bad thoughts about our stay. I went back down to the font desk, explained to another clerk that our keys would not work and the clerk looked up our information and told me that we had the correct keys, but the other clerk had put the wrong room number down on our folio. After reading many of the negative reviews, my wife and I were pleasantly surprised at how nice our room was. None of the negative remarks about dirty carpeting, peeling paint, insects, etc, were present in our room. The only negatives were the bathroom was pretty small and crowded, and our remote control for the TV did not work very well. A bottle of champagne was delivered to our room during our stay, as part of our package. They also brought us bottled water and chips, which was an unexpected but appreciated amenity. We also thoroughly enjoyed the full hot breakfast buffet in the AM as part of our room package. Valet parking is the only option available, but if you have ever spent much time in the French Quarter, valet parking at the hotel was an excellent option for us. The hotel is within a very short walk to Riverwalk, the Aquarium, and the French Quarter, the usual tourist attractions.

The bathroom was also not very big with a toilet that looked like the kind you would see in many public restrooms across the country. The shower was ok and they provided some nice lotions, etc. The major downfall of this hotel is the noise. Granted, I was there during the Essemnce Music Festival, not attending it, just happened to be there at the same time. Before the festival started and after it had ended the noise was better, but there is still a lot of noise from normal doors closing. It's a bit of a problem when you can hear the entire door closing and locking process from the rooms all around you. The bathrooms were also not very sound-proof as I could hear my neighbors having conversations at all hours of the night. The food was good. Room service was timely and efficient. The food had a lot of flavor and arrived to my room hot. Very friendly delivery people as well.

First the good stuff -The hotel is really centrally located for the French Quarter, CBD and Warehouse district, and close to street cars. The staff was nice and efficient, and the rooms were nice and clean as well, with the usual amenities that you would expect (ie. coffee maker, flat screen tv). The bed was comfy, not too hard or soft, although sheets were a little scratchy- as if too much starch was used in laundering them. The Fitness room was small, but had nice Precor machines with individual TVs and some weights to the side - enough equipment to get a good workout in. We bid for the room on priceline and got it for a cheap rate so were concerned that we'd be given the worst rooms, but instead we had a nice room on one of the mid-upper floors. Now the not so great parts - First, if you need a car, be warned that parking is very expensive here - about $34 per night. We opted not to rent a car during our stay due to the cost to park it, and just walked, or took the streetcar/cabs everywhere. Second, to get wireless internet in your room it's about $12 per night. However, if you opt not to pay that, you can still get free wireless internet access on the first or second floors. last, but perhaps the most important, the soundproofing from room to room is dismal. When ever our neighboor opened and closed their door, it sounded like our door was being opened it was so loud. All the doors slam shut, and creats quiet a racket in doing so. The toilets are also incredibly loud when flushed - sounds like a jet engin when ours is flushed, and like a motorcycle being reved up when it's our neighboors that is being flushed... ! and be prepared to hear your neighboors conversations if both of you happen to be in the bathroom at the same time..

When checking in I asked about breakfast as it was included for Diamond members. I was told that was not my chosen benefit. I knew it was as they have no executive floor and therefore are supposed to include breakfast. Why is it my job to tell them this and have to act like I am asking for something \"extra\". They were very nice about it, but come on. Know your own company's policy. We checked into a very worn room after passing through a messy hallway. This hotel is in dire need of renovation. What really is a bummer is the breakfast. They wanted to charge us extra for some of their powdered eggs that we tried as it is not part of the free breakfast. Come on man. Bread and cold cereal is pretty much all that was included. Needless to say we refused. The staff was very nice about it, but... We decided to have some drinks as we were given some free drink coupons when checking in. The restaurant and lounge was closed until 5 PM so we went to check out Harrah's across the street and came back at about 5:40 PM. Still closed. We were told we could go to the bar. Again, the staff is very nice. I had to show the bartender how to make a chocolate martini for my wife. Although completely clueless, the bartender was extremely nice. I needed to use the computer in the business center and it was the slowest computer I have been on in years.

After searching for hotels I decided me and my best friend would stay at the Marriott which is where I always stay when I am in New Orleans and i love it. However after us discussing what events we would take part in we wanted to find a room within the same price range but closer to Harrah's. I contacted Doubletree and was quoted a price of a 30.00 cheaper rate combined for both nights. I was advised that a deposit equilavent to 1 night's stay and that it was non refundable but it would gurantee your room requested.My requested promised room was a double queen bed room. I was also advised that there is parking available at a rate of 35.00. Now i should have taken into consideration that even reservations wasn't all that courteous but I let it ride thinkin that they had a busy day maybe? I can't blame the congestion of the city on the hotel but when I arrived to \"valet\" there was no one who you would think is \"vale\" since there is no specific attire or signs worn? I then asked somebody i seen with keys where do I go to valet and was then told they were not valeting anymore since it was full. I asked where am I suppose to park and I was told where to so that took another 30 minutes. After walking with my luggage through a parking garage, thru the mall, cross thru Harrah's front walkway and to the hotel me and my friend waited in line. We were finally acknoledged with do you have a reservation I stated yes and provided the needed information. The representative then stated that her co worker will finish heloing me . Now correct me if I am wrong if I have already paid one night prior to arrival and have a set reservation you would think it would be a speedy process. That is not the case the lady was typing and clicking for 15 minutes, then gave us our keys, and told us our room number. No thanks you, didn't ask any questions while she was typing, nothing. When me and my friend arrive to our room to our suprise it is a 1 queen size bed room! I contacted front desk and was told that my deposit does not guarantee bedding arrangments it just promises you a room and after requesting the supervisor I was told they were gone for the day. This was a HUGE inconvience seeing it as there are 2 woman with plenty of items cramped in a room. Front desk stated they would seend a roll bed up to our room but i was puzzled as to where would it fit seeing as to how small the room was. Housekeeping broght the bed and she was the friendliest of the whole staff. She didn't undrestand why it was requested because it was NO WHERE for the pull out bed to fit. There was no apology from front desk nor did she advise us when we was down stairs that our room was a single. I contacted corporate the next day and was told that my reservation was modified right when i checked in and no explanation was given. I filed a complaint report which is currently in progress of being taken care of. All of the reviews about un friendly staff, thin walls ecause i could hear conversations even while i was talking, you can also smell somebody using the restroom as if the air vents was connected to their toilets, and the doors open and close as if it is your door.

Being a Harrah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rewards card holder, I called them to get a room, and, with the Jazz Fest going on, they were sold out, but the best deal they could find was the DoubleTree, right across the street from Harrah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.

Harrah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reservation agent was very excited for us, and noted that it was our honeymoon on our reservation with the DoubleTree so they could do \"something special for us\" - her words, not mine. When we arrived in town, we waited in line for valet parking for 10-15 minutes, watching two valet parkers come and go, but never being acknowledged. Finally, after I got out, one came to the door to tell us that the garage was completely full, but they could give us a discount coupon for another garage. He told us they have over 300 rooms in the hotel, but only 100 spaces, so the valet sells out, especially on busy weekends. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overreact, though, since we saw a bunch of kids coming in their prom attire, and knew the jazz fest was going on. Downtown New Orleans parking is tight. Strike one.

Other adjectives include uncaring, surly, and just plain rude. Strike two. When we got to the room, it looked fine. The rooms are small, and our room only had a queen bed, even though we had requested a king. The furnishings were nice, and appeared to be recently updated. The bathroom counter, as well as the dresser top and coffee table top were granite, the furniture was real wood. The room was clean, with the exception of the TV \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was smeared, like it was cleaned with a dirty rag, and one towel rack in the bathroom is half torn off the wall. But, as another reviewer said, the toilet sounds like a large plane. With engine trouble. Maybe even an engine fire, with a large bird sucked into the engine. Maybe even an ostrich. Also, the walls and doors are beyond thin. When the person in the next door opens and closes his door, you jump because you think someone is coming into your room. And the doors are loud \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they close by themselves, and slam when they shut. Strike three.

However, at 7:46, two housekeepers were yelling to each other in the hall, and letting those loud doors slam. Strike four. I should have been counting. After we finally woke up (again), we ordered room service for breakfast. It did take the full 30-45 minutes that we were quoted, and it was our server who had the best attitude of any staff we met. She was friendly, smiled, and joked with us. However, my fried eggs were not cooked right, the grits had been sitting and formed a crust on the top, and our soft drink and orange juice were served in the plastic bottles, with no glasses or ice. Strike five. I really should have been counting. After a day of being lazy, it was time to get cleaned up and get out. I started the water for the shower, and noted how nice the water pressure was. Got the temperature right, and noticed that the tub was now alarmingly full, even though the drain was open. I decided it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that big of a deal, so I pull the diverter knob to turn on the shower, and it came off in my hand. That was enough. I called the care line (dialed 44 on the phone) and was told engineering would be up in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a few minutes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After 40 minutes, we called again to be told that engineering was backed up, but he was taking a remote to another room, and would be up in ten minutes. After almost 20 minutes more, another call got another promise. Luckily, he showed up within 5 minutes after that, apologizing because he was on the only one on call for the hotel. He was the second staff member who was polite, and I did feel sorry for him. It took him a second trip to bring back the parts, and we finally had a working shower! Repeated calls to talk to talk to the manager resulted in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at lunch.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Left messages for her to call us back, but that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. We did get a call offering two free dinners downstairs, two free breakfasts the next morning, and a tin of cookies. We passed on the dinner, since we had plans to go out. Plus, we had eaten their breakfast that morning, so we had an idea what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be in store for. The only good news about this stay (besides the cookies) was that, when we went to pay, we found that we were not charged for the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only internet and room service. Still, no apologies, no, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very sorry about the problems you experienced, therefore we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charge you for your room.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Once again, the best description you could use for the staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attitude is indifference. I present all these facts as just facts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this was a story that happened to me, and that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that everyone will have the same experience. One, two, or maybe even three things could just be a coincidence. (I lost track of how many strikes this hotel had.) However, all these events seem to show a pattern of mismanagement and poor customer service.

I sure would do so if I could find an hotel during the mardi gras. Some of the stories for other guests during the hours we waited to the rooms: * One person had a reservation but they told her no rooms are available and \"I guess you can't stay with us\" * Other person got two beds and came to ask for the one bed, they asked him to wait and left for a back room, after 15 min he gave up (will not repeat the word he said) and just left. * One lady told the she's going to complain on the bad service and rudeness, she been told \"please do, I don't care\". * A couple asked to move from none smoking two beds to smoking but been told no rooms available (remember that I got a smoking room which I didn't want). - I have many more of those...

Another review mentioned a \"chemical smell\". I actually thought my room smelled a bit of...a sewage problem.

The hotel is a little dated, it needs to be refurbished. On the plus side, it is across the street from Harrah's Casino and within walking distance of the French Quarter (also recovering), a mall and River Walk. You won't be raving about this place when you leave but it is adequate for a night or two. Most of all, you'll leave this town with a sense of awe as the people who are there are part of an unprecendented rebuilding effort. I don't know how they do it. They need the Nation's support.

WRONG! Our request at reservation time (6 weeks out) was to have a queen-bed room (smoking) on an upper floor (I understand that all requests can't be fulfilled). Anyway, at check-in we were given a room (front desk clerk gave no eye contact at all during check-in), we went to the room only to find it was a non-smoking, single double bed on a lower floor. When we arrived at the room, we told the bellman who had our luggage that the room was unacceptable. He went down and they gave us a queen-bed smoking room on the 9th floor. We thought \"Okay, we're not going to be in the room all that much!\" It was an extremely small room with only 1 chair in it. We requested a 2nd chair (I don't like sitting on the bed to drink coffee in the a.m.). The chair finally arrived on the 2nd day of our stay. The bathroom in this room was smaller than the bathroom in my 29-foot travel trailer (seriously). I went down to the front desk and complained on several occasions including the morning after our first night. It seems that the couple in the next room were pulling an \"all-nighter\" and being the beds back up to each other from room-to-room, we had head-board banging going on from about 11 p.m. until 9 a.m. the following morning. While we were drinking coffee in the morning, we sat and watched the adjoining wall vibrate for a couple hours . . . unbelievable! The clerk at the front desk told us nothing else was available. My wife and I both smoke, but after this hotel experience, we're contemplating quitting because of the stank odor of smoke in the room. They have very poor ventilation and smoking rooms stink to high heaven. The only positive thing I can say about the hotel (outside of having good cookies) is that the hotel location is excellent. Very close to French Quarter, Harrahs and the river (shopping and Aquarium). I will never ever stay at a Doubletree Inn again the rest of my life (even if it's free). We travelled from California to enjoy the Big Easy. We believed that Harrahs would offer better hotels than this one for their high-end players.

The desk clerk phoned housekeeping and asked them to \"tidy up the bathroom\" for us. Two polite Spanish speaking men arrived with two arms filled with towels.
