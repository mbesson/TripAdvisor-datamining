Everyone enjoyed the room and found the staff to be extremely helpful. Everyone waited on us hand and foot to be sure we were all taken care of. We felt like princesses - the exact experience I wanted the bride-to-be to have! We all had spa treatments and everyone raved all night long about them! Anita did 3 of the ladies' facials and she had the best personality and the girls had such a wonderful time with her. Definitely go to her for any facial needs! Nathan did the bride-to-be's massage and she felt so pampered and just loved chatting with him. He is extremely knowledgeable and definitely recommended for any massage needs! Roopa helped me to set up all of the appointments and she was so accomodating and helpful. Everything about our stay was absolutely wonderful at Hotel 1000. Everyone wanted to do it again! They all are planning on going back to the spa and staying the night at the hotel again. Everyone absolutely loved all of the staff and could not have asked for a better time.

I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but try my hand at a few games I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never seen on the Microsoft Surface touch screen table while I warmed up from the wet Seattle weather. ROOMS The rooms at Hotel 1000 range from 390 square-feet to the 2,000 square-foot Grand Suite. Every room has another distinctive touch \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a unique pedestal bathtub that fills from the ceiling. As cool as that is, what is a bathtub without a rubber ducky? Clearly this hotel thinks like I do because one was waiting for me, perched on the side of the impressive tub! Each room is equipped with a coffee maker (although why not take full advantage of the delicious coffee steps away in any direction? This is Seattle!). The modern slate blue and rust room d\u00c3\u00a9cor goes the extra mile with beds bejeweled in Thai linens and down pillows. In addition, most lights are dimmable. Finally! The rooms and suites feel like downtown apartments. Although the design elements are consistent throughout the hotel, the ambiance in each room is personal. I could easily imagine coming home to a suite like the ones in this hotel after a day spent at the famous Public Market. BEYOND THE ROOMS I am not a golfer, but I know fun when I see it. Downstairs from the lobby is The Golf Club, a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153state-of-the-art virtual golf\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room with two stations. The golfer stands on turf and lets the ball fly onto a floor-to-ceiling fabric screen that mimics a course. Depending on how the ball hits the screen, the score is tallied. I can honestly say it is the best game of golf I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever played. DINING My husband and I dined in Boka, Hotel 1000\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in-house restaurant, for breakfast the morning after we checked-in. Our server brought us a complimentary basket of pastries that made waiting for the food a pleasure. There are two entrances to Boka, one from the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lobby and one from the street. MY RECOMMENDATION Book your room! Hotel 1000 is a great find. The boutique look and residential feel as well as the unique amenities put it on my top of Seattle list. My husband and I have a YouTube channel where we showcase our luxury hotel video reviews.

When I arrived, I was not disappointed. As I approached the hotel and entered, from the staff that greeted me and opened the door, to the concierge, to the check in staff, everybody was friendly and professional. The ambience of the hotel, albeit with a no-nonsense lobby area, is crisp and trendy. There's a side room connected to the lobby with the large, modern fireplace for a cozy area to relax out of the cold. Again, the Hotel1000 staff is always pleasant, clean, and prompt to see if they can be of any service to me. They don't wait for me to approach them, which is great and shows an attention to service. The staff does seem to be on the younger side, but don't count that as a negative. They bring their energy without losing any courteousness. Since that first visit, I've stayed here a number of times. A couple times I was upgraded to a suite, without me asking if one was available. They have a firm understanding that all guests should be treated well, but they also have a great understanding that repeat guests should be made to feel extra special. This is good business and also really builds the relationship and loyalty. All of the rooms I've stayed in were nice, clean, and spacious. Good, classy decorations are used and the walls and furniture have a calm, warm color palette (no gaudy or dingy furniture here). The layouts of the rooms are open. The tubs with the ceiling spouts are an interesting feature. The only small complaint I might say is there needs to be more room lighting for after the sun goes down, BUT I would say this about all hotels. I just like it bright. To be fair, these rooms are some of the brighter ones I've stayed at for hotels. The BOKA restaurant attached to the hotel is a great place to eat when you don't want to head out to find another restaurant. Breakfast is particularly good, especially with the complementary bread basket. I would say it would be nice to have a larger selection of entrees (but maybe that's because I've eaten there so many times), but overall not a bad array of choices. As mentioned, whenever I have visited Seattle I have stayed at this hotel, and the one time I didn't was because the hotel was all booked. Bummer.

As a resident of Los Angeles I wanted to make my visit amazing, so in June of 2011 I got the idea to rent out a big hotel room and put together a surprise Christmas dinner for my family of 14 that would blow their socks off. So, who did I count on to help me find the best place? My peeps at tripadvisor.com. And wow, did reviews steer my in the best direction possible. After looking over all the data, I knew my decision had to be Hotel 1000. I chose it, sight unseen (I mean, I saw everyone's photos, which were crazy helpful). After booking the room, they put me in contact with their director of catering, Brooke Byrne and with her help, we came up with a crazy, awesome menu that would knock everyone's socks off. And I gotta say, this woman was so on the ball... it was like she was reading my mind. All my ideas she took and made better. Well, everything about this dinner was amazing. From the reception of the front desk (thanks, Michelle) to our servers that took care of us all night (thanks Oscar and Trev). And at the end of the night when the room's DVD system broke down, what did the hotel do? Oh, you know, open an entire other suite for us and set it up like a movie theater so we could all watch a movie together!!!! If that's not above and beyond, I don't know what is!!! This place was amazing! Top to bottom, I was taken care. I would never hesitate to go back, and I only hope you guys get a chance to stay here. P.S. Jennifer Formez, the pastry chef here, took it upon herself to make my favorite dessert (a Paris-Brest) and my Dad (a big food blogger in Seattle) happen to write an article about it because it was soooo good (http://www.cornichon.org/2011/12/paris-brest-and-stp.html)... the experience was truly magical. I loved this place and can't wait to come back! Thanks again, Hotel 1000... (Oh, P.S. because this was all a surprise (we met at my brother's house first to act like we had been cooking all day) some people brought their dogs. I quickly called the hotel and asked if it was okay if dogs came to our dinner.

So after greeting us with champagne and a red rose, they upgraded us to a higher level, corner room with a beautiful view.

Valet and housekeeper staff were all very nice and polite, unfortunately front desk was just ok... They were just there did their job, nothing special. We booked the city deluxe but we decided to upgrade to a corner room which i was told almost double the size, but in reality probably only 25% bigger with big corner windows plus sitting area. View was just ok, couldnt see much, blocked by the big building. We stayed on the 10th floor and could hear some noise from the street. Room was nice, had seating area, coffee press maker, tea, ipod dock, comfortable bed, nice bath robes and turn down service. I was told by the nightime manager who showed us the room before we upgraded it that the room could sometimes cost up to $1,000... Definitely NOT worth $1,000, no wow factor at all. Bathroom was spacious, separate toilet, shower, and free standing bath tub with the strange water coming out of the ceiling, however i hated taking a shower here. It took me forever to wash my hair! Terrible showerhead water pressure! To make it worse, i had to use the \"community\" molton brown soap. It reminded me so much of a gym shower where you have this public shower gel bolted to the wall to share with millions of other people. The dfference is this was worse because the pump in on the top, so i could imagine when the housekeeper refill the bottle, the older soap keep sitting on the bottom of the bottle while the the newer one sits on top, never gets rotated. This explains the black powdery looking stuff that sit on the bottom of the bottle very much. The bottle neck too was all moldy, probably never been taken out to be cleaned either since its bolted. I called the housekeeping to see if they had a different soap but they said no. So finally i found this one small NEW bottle of bath gel sitting on the bath tub which i aways asked for and used for the rest of our stay. I'd rather take a shower with a \"cheap\" soap than molton brown soap but have to share with others. I want my own new shower gel. Who is molton brown anyway? I didnt feel anything special after using the gel. Sorry! 5-10 mins walking uphill to pike place market. Not the best location but not bad either and pretty convenient. I asked if we could use the hotel car to be dropped off at the train station to go to the airport during check out but the driver was on lunch break, and the other driver was watching the hotel door since there was nobody else. Why cant they have extra people to watch the door??? Id try a different hotel when i go back to seattle, somewhere more happening perhaps.

Every interaction we had was friendly, attentive, and made us feel like our experience at the hotel was their number 1 concern. Starting with the check-in, both of the desk staff were wonderful, and went out of their way, to make my wife's birthday celebration special. They greeted us with champagne and a rose for my wife, and upgraded us to a water view room. I booked time at the Golf Club, a virtual golfing experience at the Hotel. It was fantastic, and I would highly recommend it to anyone. The manager introduced us to the experience, how to use it, and turned us loose. I got to play St Andrews with my wife! While playing, we had very attentive service from the onsite restaurant, Boka, enjoying a cold adult beverages, and a very tasty gourmet pretzel / hot dog bites. The rooms are spectacular and romantic. If your plans are to be out and about, and you just want a room for a few hours of shut eye, please, book a room somewhere else to free up a room for someone else :) From the BoKa, to the Golf Club, to the rooms. and most importantly, the wonderful people at Hotel 1000, this is truly a destination of its own, and you should plan on making time to fully appreciate and enjoy the retreat from daily hustle and pace of life.

I was dissapointed in the value of the hotel. I made the decision to pay extra to upgrade my room two levels, from The basic room to the grand luxe corner suite. Staff: C- Check-in was nothing more than average. Front desk staff was pleasant but no more friendly than a holiday inn or embassy suites staff. I am low maintance and dont usually need much help from staff or concierge. I wasn't greeted by any staff throughout the stay, not even bell man. I asked at check-out if she could arrange for a cab to pick me up, and she hesitated to help me. She told me taxis are driving by non stop so It's easy to get a cab. I had issues with my room at check-in, and the employee told me to stop by tomorrow and the manager could put me on higher floor (I didnt really care what floor I was on). The staff at the Boca bar was really nice, epecially the bartenders. Room: B Overall the room was nice, but not nice enough for what I paid. Since I paid extra to upgrade, I expected a little nicer view or slightly larger room. My bathroom didn't have the cool bath tubs (with water from ceiling), the view was not great from 7th floor. The view from my window was an empty office building and a bunch of heating and ac vents. My bathroom didnt even have an enclosed shower or toilet. My bathroom had a gross shower curtain, it seemed odd. I could barely fit in it it was so small. The floor to ceiling windows were really nice. The beds werent really soft. The room overall (except the shower curtain) was very clean, otherwise I would rate this room lower. Location: b+ The hotel is within a short walking distance of everywhere you need to go downtown. The hotel is located right next to a 24-7 porn shop called taboo. It seemed out of place. The other downtown hotels look slightly closer to the shopping areas. The hotel has a star bucks across the street which was nice. Spa/pool: no review Restaurant: I didnt eat at the restaurant or order room service. The bar was nice and the staff was friendly here. Other issues: I requested a different room when I checked in, hoping for a different bathroom or better view. Again, I only made this request because I paid more to upgrade (but it didn seem like I had an upgraded room). So I went from 7th floor to 10th floor to a different room. The room looked like a dungeon with no view in corner of building. I ended up going back to my original room. Overall value: C+ Overall, for the price I paid I wish I would have stayed somewhere else. The only positives were champagne at check-in, panoramic windows, free wifi and an easy walk to shopping and market. I could have stayed at the 4 seasons or another nice hotel for this price range. Nothing stood out for me, and I have no idea how others claimed to have exceptional customer service. The management needs to take a look at improving its customer service. Before I checked in I attempted to contact the hotel twice, with no response to my voice mails. I told them at check-in it was strange, but the staff shrugged it off. This was the vibe I got from the staff, not rude, they just didnt really care...

As has been thoroughly covered in previous reviews, the bathroom was great with the tub that filled from the ceiling and an awesome showerhead, as well as high end toiletries. (I acutally used the shampoo and conditioner, which is unusual). They must've turned back the pressure, because the splashing when filling the tub was minimal, and they've also included small bottles of bath gel so that you don't have to get it out of the larger dispensers in the shower. The rubber duckie was a fun touch. The lighting in the rooms is superb, with most of the lights on dimmer switches. The bedding was some of the best I've encountered. We walked all over downtown Seattle, and I don't think there could have been a better location, roughly halfway between the Market and Pioneer Square. If you're driving or renting a car, be prepared, there is little overnight parking available in the area, and we ended up having to use the valet a couple of evenings when returning after many of the garages had locked up for the night (6:30pm). The valet is quick and professional, but at $40 plus tip, it's more than I'd like to spend. On the nights that we did make it into other garages, (didn't utilize valet), it cost $20 overnight. Overall, the service was great - they did a great job striking a balance between warm/friendly and professional. Definately try the restaurant (BOKA) or order room service.

Now the problems: The tub fills from the ceiling and when it starts it literally splashes water all over the bathroom. The new wallpaper was already starting to peel in some areas. While cute in concept, the execution left a soggy mess. The second one is that the shower and toilet areas share the same 'airspace'. Not to be too graphic, but the person in the shower in the morning will be sharing some not as pleasant air if you happen to be sharing the bathroom (which it's almost impossible not to do). I would advise the hotel to increase the fan speed of the vent, but there's not much to be done as the design is already set. Overall the design of the bathroom is a flawed one; beautiful to look at, but a mess in execution.

Really.

Usually they are either too big or too small ( or too gross) to bathe comfortably, but this was the Goldilocks Tub, just right in terms of size. The beds were extremely comfortable and the room had everything you could ask for and more, including robes that I didn't feel squeamish putting on. We tried out the spa, and it was excellent and we had two very nice massages though the prices are a bit steep (perhaps that is the usual for Seattle but it was more than a third above what we are used to paying...I can't really compare prices due to being unfamiliar with Seattle's base price but we've had massages in almost every geographic region of the US and these were definitely among the most expensive). However, the spa was very nice. The gym was adequately equipped. The location was excellent, in easy walking distance to several local attractions and the staff was universally friendly, helpful and pleasant and we had no problems whatsoever with any of the amenities features or room service. I am dinging this hotel a single star for one specific reason, that is possibly not an issue for the weekend traveler, and I have recently decided that I am going to ding every hotel we stay at that does not provide this service: a guest operated laundry facility.

The upper end hotels (and even the mid-range hotels) now rely on severely over-priced laundry services that are completely ridiculous. We arrived at Hotel 1000 and we had about ten days worth of laundry to do and still a week left on our vacation--a major laundering was needed. Hotel 1000 charges $9.00 for a pair of pants to be laundered. I priced out having my laundry sent out to be cleaned and realized that the total to do my laundry would have been about $250 and that's if I sink washed socks and underclothes! If they offered a coin-operated laundry unit, I could have washed the same clothes in roughly two loads for less than $20. I found this completely ridiculous. I don't believe the extended traveler should be gouged on laundry, nor should they have to schlepp their dirty clothes to a laundromat (in this case the closest one was 2 miles away) and I don't believe it's entirely beyond the realm of space considerations to place a coin-operated laundry facility on hotel premises.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glen Burnie, MD", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Place\u201d", "Author": "Xploringtheworld", "ReviewID": "UR118627270", "Content": "My husband and I loved this hotel!!

I particularly liked the television feature of being able to sit back, relax and watch a stunning slideshow of photographs from around the world while listening to music. The Staff were incredibly helpful with suggestions (restaurants, sights, etc) and they were appreciative of our car-less status. The Concierge was quick to get us a taxi if need be, or show us walking directions on the map. And honestly, you really can do downtown Seattle some justice without the expense of a rental car. I also particularly loved the Bathroom amenities and the Molton Brown Toiletries. This was a Bath Lovers Paradise! The tub was enormous (big enough for two, if you like) and separate from the shower which was located on the opposite side of the bathroom. The tub also fills from a spout located in the ceiling which looks pretty neat, but takes away from the peaceful \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh let me just warm this bath up a bit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd option. It should also be noted that there is no privacy unless you roll down the Blind as the bathroom wall connected to the living room is actually a window and not a wall at all. Our room was clearly for Couples, and not Business Associates. My only complaint would be the fact that the Shower did splash a bit out onto the floor, since it is all the same level with no divider. But other than that, feel free to Sleep, Bathe, and Relax Away at Hotel 1000. And if you travel like we did, you'll need the respite after a long day of hoofing around downtown Seattle.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cgreat weekend get away!\u201d", "Author": "mojostillhotel", "ReviewID": "UR115070285", "Content": "The hotel was really cool and modern.

The lobby itself isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very big, but there is always water in the afternoon and coffee in the morning for guests to enjoy. We were in room 802, which was a corner suite overlooking Madison Street and the back of the hotel. The room was very spacious! Windows wrapped the entire room, so there is a lot of sunlight. Towards the back of the room by the rear windows, there is a long sofa and a comfortable chair. A flat-panel TV is in the same area, and it is on a swivel bracket so you can turn the TV towards the bed if you want to watch shows from there. There is also a large desk in the room that overlooks the street. The closet space is also huge. A mini bar is located in the room, and you can make your own coffee in the morning with coffee grinds and a French press. The bathroom was pretty impressive. There is a separate shower, tub, and toilet. The tub is pretty neat because the water comes from the ceiling. Just remember to close the blinds when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re taking a bath here because people passing by on the street can definitely look in. There are two very comfortable robes in the room, and all the lotions, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash are Molton Brown. The room has free Wi-Fi, so it was easy and convenient to stay connected. The turndown service is also nice. When they turn down your bed, they leave you with two pieces of chocolate that were very tasty! We had our morning breakfast in Boka, and the food was really good.

I also had the croissant French toast that was pretty good. The breakfast meal portions are big, so wake up hungry! The location is great! Pike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Market is about a 5-minute walk down 1st Avenue and the harbor is a couple of blocks down from the hotel. The only down side about the location is that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s towards the bottom of a large hill, so if you need to head inland, you have to walk up steep hills. Parking is pretty expensive here at $39 plus tax. But the valet guys are very good and fast. Each time someone got our car, we have two bottles of water with their compliments in the drink holders.

This hotel was quite a splurge for us, so we expected it to be amazing in every way. At first everything seemed perfect, the valet service was nice, check-in was friendly and we were offered sparkling wine, the room was beautiful, with big windows with a nice view (there are buildings infront of the water, but we expected that) and the bath was wonderful! Upon arrival to our room, we were greeted with a small fruit topped cake with a sign made out of chocolate that said \"happy 10th anniversary\" and our name, along with the wine and chocolates. So far so good. But we didn't see anything about breakfast or the rose petals, and assumed they would be brought later. Eventually they called and said they had our breakfast certificate, which they had forgotten to give us earlier. Well, we never did get our petals, which we were told got delivered to the wrong room. They did compensate for it at check-out by taking a little off our bill. But I have to say, the breakfast was a big dissapointment. We ordered in room service from the order form that you put out on the door at night...there were really only 2 options besides a continental breakfast: Boka breakfast which my husband ordered, and omlette, which I ordered, along with a glass of orange juice each. (I had been looking forward to french toast which I saw online, but it wasn't even on the menu there.) The Boka breakfast was measly and over done: one egg, some bacon, a bit of hashed brown potatoes, and a very flat dry english muffin, slapped very un-presentably on the plate. My omlette was ok, but nothing better than what I've had at far cheaper places! And the cost for that came to $48!!! Well, we were told we \"went over\" on our complimentary breakfast, (which we still had to pay room service fee) and were charged extra! There was no previous explanation of what we were allowed to get, so we assumed it was the 2 main meals offered. I would suggest not bothering with the extra packages. They don't seem worth it at all, and only left us feeling dissapointed and a little scammed. I'm afraid those details prevent me from recommending this hotel.

Thanks to Amex FHR I was upgraded to a suite, which whilst it had no view, was very nice. The room has some nice features, such as an audio cable to plug your mp3 player into the TV. A lot of hotels now provide you the ability to connect your music or laptop to the TV, but never give you the cables, and who carries one with them? There was also an ipod cable so you could connect that or charge it if needed. It's about the only hotel I've stayed in where the HD TV displays everything in the right format. There is some style over substance. The bath that fills from the ceiling may look nice, but in reality it splashes water everywhere, and the water had to be on full to get it hot. It's then almost impossible to top up the bath later on. The hotel is in a great location, a few blocks from the University Street station if you come in via the Light Rail, just head for the 2nd Ave exit. Ordered a continental breakfast on my first day, and all I got was a yoghurt muesli thing. The tray came with jams and butter, but a bit pointless with no pastries or croissants to have them with. Wasn't sure if I'd made a mistake on the card or not, but didn't seem much of a continental breakfast. The breakfast card also wasn't replaced so hard to re-order the next day. I decided on breakfast in the restaurant after that, and one time was seated then ignored, a coffee came with no spoon or sugar, but no issues the other times. All the staff I did interact with, seemed to be genuinely happy and interested.

A relative suggested I try Hotel 1000. I could not have been more pleasantly surprised. When I arrived to the hotel, I immediately felt welcome. The person who checked me in was genuine and seemed happy to be there. The room was spacious and bright. My room had a great view of the water. Furnishings were extremely comfortable and practical. The technology was of-the-moment. Every staff member I encountered during my stay was smiling, helpful and professional. I had a late night dinner in the restaurant one night, at the bar. The atmosphere was bustling yet not too trendy and the food was innovative and flavorful. One hidden treasure I didn't know they had but discovered was the Golf Club. What a cool spot! I played some holes at Pebble Beach with a friend and we ordered some beers and snacks - it was great for a rainy night when we didn't feel like leaving. The location of the hotel is perfect. One rainy night I was going out to meet a client and the valet offered to drive me in their house car. Ben (I believe that was his name), the driver, was engaging and courteous.

Booked the Luxe Guestroom (no view or suite) for $180 a night which is well below the regular price. I called to confirm 3 days before and they sent me an e-mail for pre-arrival that we could fill out and send back requesting car service from the airport or to book spa services, etc. We didn't book anything at that time, but did let them know we would be arriving early (8:30 am) and if we could check in early. We asked the best way to get from the airport to the hotel. They suggested car service for $75, taxi service at about $35 or the Link Light Rail at $5. We opted for the Light Rail. It was only a few blocks to the hotel from the station and we travel light so it was excellent and a great way to see the city (takes about an hour). Check-In ~ We arrived at 8:30 am and were not only checked in immediately, but were upgraded to a choice of rooms that Jaime took us to to check out. We were given the choice of a suite with a sitting room, but no tub or a city view corner room with a tub. I wanted the tub! We were unpacked before 9 am. Incredible! The Room ~ Room had ceiling to floor windows on 3 sides. Tons of natural light. Awesome. King bed was very comfortable with fabulous sheets. So soft. My husband loved the pillows, but I prefer a firmer one, which they sent up immediately. Sitting area with a chair, coffee table and couch (pull-out). Very comfy place to read your choice of complimentary newspapers in the morning. Desk and technology area was well-equipped with cords (iPhone, etc) if you forgot them. FREE Wifi, which is usually such a rip off when you have to pay. Laptop size safe (large enough for 13 inch, not sure about 15 inch though) and really fun options on the TV). Free local AND long distance calls. Bar, coffee area was nice. Ice in bags right outside our room in coolers rather than those loud ice machines. Bathroom was a highlight for me. Beautiful shower (enough room for 2) with a comforting shower head. Incredible 2 person bathtub that fills from the ceiling and the tap is on the wall which means no tap or spout in the way. It was really relaxing, especially with a window overlooking the city (there was a shade that lowered electronically if you wanted). Molten Brown products were nice and I appreciated the large bottles on the wall instead of those wasteful small bottles that you take home, but never use. Boka Restaurant ~ We had brunch and it was good. I loved the truffle fries! The Studio ~ Nice seats and fire to sit around. We played a game of checkers on the computer table (like a huge iPad). Spaahh ~ I had a body treatment done (Enrapture). It was relaxing and great for my skin. On par price wise with any other hotel I have had spa treatments. Virtual Golf ~ My husband did this while I had my spa treatment. He booked a tee time the day before, but may not be required. Only negative was that someone had left there young teens there and they were messing around in the second tee box. It didn't bother my husband, but when two others came to really play they wouldn't leave. More of a parenting thing than hotel thing though. They also have a Wii with an assortment of games. Library ~ Lovely room with classic books and comfy chairs. Front Desk, Housekeeping, Concierge and Overall Service ~ Early check-in and up-grade was great, thanks Jaime. Complimentary coffee and or iced tea in the lobby was welcome! Housekeeping was done promptly and wonderfully whenever we pushed to button to have our room made up. We were never bothered when we had the electronic Do Not Disturb on. Excellent recommendations for dinner and reservations made, thanks Colten and Casey. We went to Metropolitan Grill and Casey had an amazing appetizer waiting for us. Above and beyond. There was a town car to take us around downtown as a complimentary service. We are walkers so we didn't use it, but we saw others use it and they were impressed. We were there celebrating our anniversary and we came home on our first night to a note from the staff as well as a plate of superb cupcakes and Happy Anniversary to us written in chocolate on the plate. Yummy!! Check-out ~ Quick! We also used the Business center to print out our boarding passes. We walked back to the Light Rail and headed home.

Before making my decision, I was contacted by a social media coordinator, who read my forum post asking about Hotel 1000. She gave me some insight into the hotel and even put me in touch with a manager who could take care of a concern I had. They have a policy to charge an authorization one nights charge plus $200 per night upon arrival. This is ONLY an authorization. We were going to be there 4 nights so $1000 plus seemed ridiculous. Upon check in, they only authorized for $400. We didnt even have to ask her to do it, but she accommodated us. Upon check in, the doormen were super cute and nice. Miko at the front desk was helpful, friendly and a fellow foodie so we would often touch base with her when we came and went. The concierge was excellent. Eric made reservations for us before we even got there, gave great advice, followed up with us and as a nice touch send us a free appetizer to the waterfront grill where he had recommended us to. His tip was earned:) The hotel is modern, clean, and comfortable. Our double bed room was on the 12th floor with a city view which was just fine with us. We were told they only have ONE room with double beds that faces the water view and it was taken. Its noisy only if you open the window which opens only slightly.

The housekeeping service does an incredible job and the condition of the hotel overall is perfect. They obviously pride themselves as being extremely professional and courteous. They abide by the old way of business; the customer is always right. Not many places still honor that. The BOKA restaurant looked very good for food, but we explored all the little \"hole-in-the-wall\" places we could find. We weren't disappointed. There was not one bad meal the entire week. We stayed for 9 days and ate at Pike's place almost every morning for fresh breakfast. The hotel is perfectly located in an area where walking anywhere is feasible. The only time we needed a taxi was going to the Space Needle and the airport. The taxi costs were very low. All in all, Hotel 1000 is a hotel where you can't go wrong. If you are worried about reserving the perfect hotel for an incredible trip, then this is your hotel. They will not disappoint you, and they will go the extra mile to surprise you and make your trip special.

We were upgraded to a city-view with a king bed with asking. When we booked, they only had a 2 queen room with no view. The room was very roomy and had everything you would need. The tub is something my wife used everyday. The bed made us not miss the one from home because it was so comfy. Internet was a huge plus for us. And it was free too!!! There no ice machines here, they bag packs of ice and put in a freezer chest for you to grab near the elevator. Everytime we stepped into lobby, we were always greeted with a smile and our name. That is a huge plus in our book. Staff gave great recommendations of local eats. They never gave bad recommendations. Thank you to Run at the front desk for the french crepe place. We ate there every morning!! BOKA, there resturant on site has a great happy hour. Food was awesome, we found ourselves ordering more food because their reverse happy hour was 50% off all urban bites. What a deal that was.

We were delighted with the sleection, service and quality (local ingredients featured).

What a wonderful experience!!!! We will definitely be coming back to stay! We have nothing but good things to say about the place...and considering we booked the hotel based on other TripAdvisor members' comments, thought it was important to give credit where credit is due. :) The staff was beyond friendly and helpful. Everyone was great--the doormen out front, the front desk reception, the servers in Studio 1000 (hotel lounge), the concierge, the room service staff, the golf attendant, the spa attendant...everyone had a smile on their face! It was as though they were happy to see us! What a wonderful way to spend the weekend at a hotel! The room itself is beautiful...the tub that fills from the ceiling is truly a sight to see. The sheets are extremely soft and the robes are nice as well. The bar comes fully stocked with nice wine glasses, drinking glasses and even a wine opener. The television has a few cool features. One of them is an interactive menu with options such as \"Dining,\" \"Personal Music,\" \"Movies,\" etc. It even had our name up on the screen to greet us when we first checked in. Additionally, there are a variety of scenic views to choose from (which is basically a still video of a landscape with relaxing music in the background). We underestimated the power of this as both of us fell asleep to the soothing sounds of the waves and the view of the beach in Mexico! HBO is included in the room and they have a decent selection of pay-per-view movies. We only entered one issue during our stay, but that issue was resolved efficiently so we have no complaints!!! When we first checked into our room, the screen in between the bathroom and the bedroom area didn't work. We told our bellman and someone at the front desk and they said they would have an engineer up to look at it right away. When we came back about an hour later, it still wasn't fixed. We went downstairs and explained that it still wasn't fixed. They immediately gave us the room next door. The Studio 1000 lounge is wonderful. I can't say enough about it. It's a small, intimate setting with delicious food (the grilled cheese and tomato soup is to die for!) and an amazing wait staff! If you can get a seat around the fire, all the better...but the surrounding chairs are comfortable as well. We could not have asked for better service! One quick example...we went downstairs to Studio 1000 looking forward to cozying up next to the fire, ordering a glass of wine and a few appetizers. When we arrived, we were disappointed to find that there were no more seats available in the small space. Immediately, the manager sugegsted an area where we could wait while he rustled up some chairs (from a different location) so we could sit. He came back right away with two comfortable chairs and placed us right up near the fire. Following our drinks and appetizers, he suggested a few seafood restaurants in the area that we might like to try. The following evening when we went back, he remembered both of our names. It's small details like that that truly make one's stay memorable. The location of the hotel is also great. It's very close to Pike Place Market. We took a cab the first day only to realize that we were only a few blocks away. We were able to walk to nearly every restaurant or lounge we visited. It was only a 10-minute ride to Safeco stadium where we saw a baseball game. I would absolutely, without-a-doubt recommend this hotel to others!!!!!!

I especially enjoyed the 'business center' with the free internet service as this was a very nice touch. The room was beautiful and comfortable and luxurious. The bathroom amenities and quality soaps were a nice touch. The only negatives really is a common complaint I have with fancy hotels. The more expensive they are the more they charge for the little things that you normally receive at a 3* hotel. Water is $4 a bottle, there is no complimentary shuttle to/from the airport, there is no continental breafast. We stayed at a Portland hotel earlier that truly impressed us because of these little things (as well as their large, comfortable, clean and affordable room). I might sound picky but your average business 3* hotel will give you these basic amenties, but when a hotel like the Hotel 1000 is charging $250-400 a night, seriously why charge for water? Do they really need that extra $4? Why not offer some basic pastries for breakfast? Isn't there enough profit to be made on the room charge itself. Perhaps the main thing that would keep me from staying here is the location.

We had a nice visit over our drink, our hostess sat us 15 minutes later, apologizing profusely. Only to find out she sent out (2) appetizers as a thank you for being patient. We nibbled on the Sugar Cane Skewered Crab Cakes (Delicious) and the BBQ Beef Sliders (Tasty). We each had a flight of wine (Great Selections) shared a salad and Asparagas Spears (not so great). I had the Lamb for dinner which paired nicely with my flight of red wine from French Region (Cotes Du Rhone), my husband had the roasted chicken with white wine. They even put together some ice cream for us to take to eat with our wedding cake! Great service, excellent staff, can't wait to go back. 4) We brought our dog Lola, she is 24lb Puggle and is all love and licks.

The hotel has town car drop off service, they fail to tell you this at check in. 3. Our room was not vacuumed and the carpet was dirty. Upon complaint they vacuumed promptly. 4. The TV turns off by itself to reboot the system. This happens often. 5. They don't seem to have a laundry service. 6.

Room service prices are inaccurate, while it is not listed anywhere in the menu book they add large service charges and delivery fees. Not unusual but notice is a good thing. 8.

He was in Seattle for work, and I tagged along to hang out and explore the city. I also brought a day or two of work with me. I was looking forward to seeing the hotel because I heard that David Beckham stayed there a few months ago. We were upgraded to a huge suite, so of course I was able to fantasize that maybe I was sleeping in the SAME BED that David Beckham once slept in! Me, my husband, and the aura of David Beckham, all in that big comfy bed. The bedroom was bigger than our bedroom at home; the bathroom was bigger than our bathroom at home; and the living room was bigger than our living room at home. We even had a dining table that was - you guessed it - bigger than our dining table at home. There were two flat screen TVs, including one in the bedroom, and my husband looooved that. The furnishings were comfortable and I loved the Molten Brown toiletries. I took a couple baths in the neat-o tub and I enjoyed the separate shower with two showerheads. Local and long distance calls were free, and there was free internet access in the living room (either through Wi Fi or a cable that they provide to connect your laptop to the jack in the wall). My only complaint was that the Wi Fi stopped working 3 days into our stay, and the cable was very short. So to use my computer, I had to either sit in an armchair with the laptop balanced on the arm, or sit on the floor with the laptop on the very low coffee table. This was uncomfortable and my legs would cramp up very quickly. The workspace options should be better thought out; I would have loved it if the cable had reached the dining table so that I could have worked there. The location of the hotel is terrific. Just a short stroll to Pike Place Market in one direction, and a short stroll to Pioneer Square in the other. The front desk service was excellent, but I had a few negative experiences with housekeeping. For example, they did not really clean the shower stall. I have thick hair and it was disgusting to watch the hair collect on the drain cover. I know I could have easily cleaned it myself, but I wanted to see how long it would be before they actually cleaned the shower. After a couple more days I had to clean it myself because the water would no longer drain. This was gross, but I consoled myself with the thought that maybe some of David Beckham's hairs were still in the shower, too. On another day, I was in the room working and I had the \"Do Not Disturb\" light on. Suddenly the door opened and a housecleaner came into the room. She didn't knock or announce herself at all. She seemed genuinely surprised to see me, but not as surprised as I was. I asked her why she came in when the \"Do Not Disturb\" light was on, and she said it was because she thought we had checked out that day. I said,\"'Even if you thought we had checked out, when you saw the 'Do Not Disturb' light on, why didn't you knock or announce yourself?\" She just apologized repeatedly and left. So that did not make me feel great about hotel security. What if she had come in while I was taking a bath, or in bed with the aura of David Beckham? Thank heaven I was just working. A couple other notes: The gym in the basement is small, but I liked that it was stocked with towels and bottled water. The free strawberry lemonade in the lobby is really tasty and my husband had a glass every day. Our room was huge, but very dark.

We had a corner room on the 12th floor. The view swept from Mount Rainer & the Stadiums, around to the Sound and Bainbridge Island. It was gorgeous. We were fortunate as the weather was in the low 80's and there wasn't a cloud in the sky. So the city was incredibly gorgeous around the hotel. When we arrived the valet was prompt and polite in taking care of us. We went to check in at 4 and they were doing a final run through on our room. We waited no more than 5 minutes, and our keys were issued. I discovered the heavenly fresh strawberry lemonade in the lobby as I waited! What a treat! Good stuff. When we arrived in our room, it had the fragrance of cleanliness. As if they had spritzed lysol to give it some freshness. It was nice. We of course were taken back by the beautiful views first. Then pleasantly surprised by the size of the room. There was a nice seating area at the end of the room that we weren't expecting. The linens on the bed were heavenly. So soft, almost as smooth as satin. The bed was comfortable, but it wasn't the most steady. It was unusually bouncy. I felt every turn from my husband as he slept. But it wasn't that bad. I'm just used to my Beauty Rest at home and the Westin Heavenly bed (Which is the same mattress.) Hotel 1000 has better sheets...I guess you can't have it all. The bathroom was huge. And I loved the full sized soaps, lotions & hair products throughout. I didn't have time to bathe but the tub was cool. If the weather wasn't so nice, I might have been indoors more and enjoyed a bath. But we were on the go and barely there. I liked the rain shower, but it's mounted on the wall which I found odd. I'm used to it being mounted over head and cascading down. All the fixtures are Kohler and very high end. Even the toilet is high end. Be mindful that if you stay here, there are certain \"givens.\" The sounds of the city can be heard from your room (honking, music, boat horns...the general hustle and bussle of a downtown city). It didn't bother me on the 12th floor much. But my husband's mom was on the 8th floor and found it distracting. Also, getting around town is often difficult. There are many one way streets and going a mile can take a lot longer than expected. But it goes with the territory so it didn't bother me. We took the ferry over to bainbridge island. I recommend the trip. You catch the ferry a few blocks from the hotel. I think it was $12 for the car and driver and $6 for additional passengers. The boat was fun. And the island was beautiful. Cherry blosoms were in bloom too. It's much like the east coast...Nantucket feel. We came back on the 7:10 boat and had a gorgeous sunset cruise. So amazing! Took a day trip to Canada too. Got lucky and the boarder lines were short. We waited no more than 10 minutes on either side. The drive to Victoria was about 2 1/2 hours each way. For those of you who are from big cities...be prepared. The Northwestern Crowd drive the speed limit. I CA we go 70-80 on a regular basis...they go 50-60! Plan on being patient. Very impressive hotel, and fantastic location. I forgot to mention only a mile from Qwest and Safeco field. We drove to the stadum to see the Mariners/Angels game. But you could have walked. Parking was $20. Oh, and our last day there we woke up to tradiatinal Seattle weather. Gloomy, drizzling and cold. Sadly, you couldn't see Mt. Rainer or the island. So if it's not clear...you may not get to see the impressive views.

Mention you like golf to the excellent staff at the front desk when you check in, and when you enter your room, classical music will be playing and the television will be set to the channel showing the greatest golf courses of the world. There are approximately a dozen channels that feature photographic slide shows on subjects from sailing to hiking to tropical resorts. Seriously cool. Of COURSE everyone will mention the bathroom with the glass wall opening into the bedroom and the tub that fills from the ceiling, this is a luxury, spa like setting and the bathroom is almost as state of the art as their technology. WIFI is throughout the hotel's common areas and in each guest room. The telephones are VOIP technology with guides to the hotel, the area and the nightlife right on the phone screen. Ask the front desk for a water view room if possible, facing west, although I imagine the city view rooms are just as spectacular. The hotel restaurant, BOKA is a wise choice for happy hour (with tapas-style \"urban bites\" for half price as well as the drinks). A golf club with two golf simulator bays is in the lower level of the hotel along with their fitness center and spaaaah (as they call it). Plan to check out the golf simulator during happy hours weekdays for 1/2 price golf and drinks, almost feels like your on the course. The staff is unbelievable, service is efficient and professional, the only delay in any service is getting your car from the hotel valet (as they have to park it off-site). The hotel's location is at 1st and Madison, an easy walk to Pike Place Market, the Seattle Art Museum, the waterfront, ferries and numerous restaurants.

This hotel is considered a \"four star\" hotel, but we both felt that it could easily be a \"five star.\" First off, the hotel ambiance is extremelly relaxing and peaceful. It is somewhat dark inside and decorated with darker hues, but in a way that is very calming. The rooms are absolutely unbelievable. We had a king waterview and though we paid a little more for the view, the windows were huge and gave us a great view of the Sound. There were also lots of nice touches like a flat screen that is personalized during your stay, a great bed with nice linens and lots of storage space. The room was a little small, but more than adequate for us! The bathroom is to die for - I would love to have a duplicate made for my home! Secondly, the food at the hotel is wonderful - we ate at the restaurant once and had an excellent meal and they have a really nice happy hour each evening in front of the fire that we enjoyed every night we were there. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating and we were sorry to leave them at the end of our stay! We did not use the Spaah services but we did play virtual golf, which was a lot of fun - I would recommend it if you find yourself with an extra hour or so. We would return to the Hotel 1000 in a hot second - there is no where else we would stay in Seattle and we did our fair share of checking out some of the other hotels we were looking at. (Hotel Monaco, Hotel Vintage Park, Edgewater, etc.) - none even compared in our opinion. The location is also one of the best you can ask for in the city! If you get the chance and can afford it, definitely stay at this hotel - it will make your Seattle experience even better!", "Date": "March 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutey perfect time at Hotel 1000!\u201d", "Author": "forzuto13", "ReviewID": "UR13180881", "Content": "I stayed here at the Hotel 1000 for eleven nights while in Seattle for some govt. training. The Jackson Federal Building is conveniently located right across the street from the hotel. When I first called the guest relations rep I was told that I couldn't get the govt. rate for dates listed but the lady was able to confirm me and took also my requests for a king bed, quiet location and the infamous bathtub that fills from the ceiling. Upon check-in I was told that they were able to honor my request with a complimentary upgrade. The room was on the 12th floor and was nothing less than perfect! When I first entered I found the 40 \" flat-screen HD TV (mounted on the wall) playing some relaxing classical music along with a selected program offering Renaissance art. You can play different themed programs. My favorite was the \"1000 Places to Visit Before You Die.\" The room is nicely decorated in a subdued Asian theme, with dark floors, bamboo, blue and maroon walls. The king-sized bed was super comfortable, with nice feather pillows. The room itself was spacious and a had a large desk with lamp. The services there are extremely good. There is free long distance phone calling from the rooms and the business office. There are two computers with free internet. I was usually the only person in the room at any time. There is a really cool library located on the fourth floor that has nice comfy chairs and a fire place and you can choose the same music programs that are in each of the rooms. My friend and I went there one evening with a bottle of wine, dimmed the lights, put on the classical music, and had a very pleasant evening. There is a decent gym, although a little small in size. Still it has two elliptical trainers and treadmills. Free weights up to 50 lbs and three different fixed machines for shoulders, legs and back/triceps. There is a spa with services next to the gym and also a golfing simulator. Parking is availabe in garage and was for guests only when I was there. It can be pricey, however. The entire staff there was always very accomodating and friendly. Most are pretty young, but all very eager to assist you and always greeting you upon entering and leaving. The room service provides you with free Starbucks coffee to brew in the french presses that are in the rooms. I requested a refridgerator be brought up to my room so I could keep some food in their during my stay. What's also great is that the hotel is downtown and there are several happy hour offers nearby where you can get cheap appetizers and drinks. The hotel bar/restaurant has their own happy hour from 4-6 pm. I would always go to this place, called Contour, that was south on First Ave a block and a half. They have one of the latest happy hours around, lasting from 3 to 8 pm every day! Try the provolone cheeseburgers and lamb kebabs. Each only $1.95 at the time of my stay. Later the place become a club. The hotel is near Pier 54, where the famed Ivar's is (good for fish and chips with yummy tartar sauce!), and also close to Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, Benaroya Symphony Hall and the Triple Door jazz club. Most things are within walking distance. Try Cafe Zum Zum for a cheap lunch. Pakistani food - various curries over basmati rice for around six bucks. We also went to Cafe Denunzio one evening. The dining room is charmingly decorated, and Tonnino, our server, was really nice. The food was pretty good but the was pretty blah. So you can see I was totally impressed with my stay at the Hotel 1000 in the Emerald City! Nothing short of perfect, actually. The cool thing about this hotel is it's size. I mean it's just big enough to have all the accomodations but also small enough to be intimate and not impersonal, like some of the big chain hotels. I highly recommend this place for anyone. Maybe not so much for big families with kids, but for sure for couples, seniors, and business people.

It had a very classy atmosphere and if you're a couple or a business traveler you will feel very comfortable. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. All the rooms are ultra-modern and feature plasma televisions, complementary internet, and even a bathtub that fills from the ceiling. Their restaurant right off of the lobby is also very good and has some great deals on drinks and food too if you check them out for their reverse happy hour in the late evening. They also have a nice and small but functional business center and a fully-equipped workout center free of charge. The minibar is also fairly inexpensive. I will admit that it's not the most affordable but to be right downtown and a short walk from Pike Place, anything decent is going to be expensive. The only issue I had during the stay is how expensive and disorganized the room service was. Not only were the food prices expensive (to be expected anyway I guess), but there two different unexplained service charges on the bill also and that didn't include tax or gratuity.... I'm very used to having an automatic gratuity on the bill and I assumed that it was included in one of the service charges, however it was explained to me by the valet (which is who they have deliver the food apparently) that it is not so I also had to tip him. For a late night snack of a shrimp cocktail and a bowl of soup I think I ended up paying about $35.00 overall. The breakfast costed roughly the same and it was also somewhat disappointing. So, overall I was very pleased with the amenities, cleanliness, and luxury of Hotel 1000 and would definitely stay there again no question. Being that room service was the only part that was lacking, I just won't order it next time, not a big deal. If you are concerned with room service I guess you could stay at the larger, more expensive W Hotel but with that expect impersonal service and daily internet access fees I suppose.

The room was really cool as was the bathroom. Be careful of the mini bar. If you remove an item for more than 30 seconds, it automatically is charged to your room. this in no joke! That alone was a huge turnoff. The next morning I went in search of coffee and found service set up in the library. However, no coffee was in the pot. I called the front desk and they said housekeeping would be up shortly but they were busy. 25 min go by and no coffee. we call again and they assured us someone would be by. 10 min later housekeeping comes by and removes the pot and slides the others around (decaf and hot water) and leaves to refill the regular coffee pot. (I assumed). 20 min later we call back down to complain no coffee. finally housekeeping comes and says she had replaced it earlier when she was in. in fact, what she did was switch the decaf label and the regular label so that the full pot of decaf now said regular. i know this to be true as i was sitting in a chair and watching who came and went the whole time. A new pot was never brought in and if it had, I would have been the first to jump for it after waiting so long. I could have made coffee in the room but I am not a fan of the french press and that is what they offered. The final complaint is that housekeeping came to make up the sleeper sofa at 6:30 and I asked if they could come back as were relaxing in the room ( just checked in) and were sitting on the sofa watching t.v. I felt rushed as she said they were their until 8:00 so i told her to come back at 7:30 and we hurried to get out the door for dinner. i have stayed at the inn at the market and prefer that. they have a wonderful rooftop overlooking the water.

It is very boutique chic, kind of W Hotel at half the price. We were super impressed with the room and the bathroom with the tub that fills from the ceiling. They have Molten Brown bath toiletries, and lush towels. Everything seemed top notch. We were staying there for my birthday weekend for 2 nights. When we got back to the room the first night, we tried to watch a movie, but neither the remote control nor keyboard were working for the TV, so we couldn't get internet or TV. We called the front desk and they sent someone up, but he couldn't fix it. We asked them to fix it during the day while we were out the next day. When we returned to our room at the end of the night the next night, we had a really nice tray of truffles and chocolate covered strawberries with both still and bubbly water. We aren't sure to this day if it was for the broken TV or for my birthday. They didn't say. But it was a nice touch either way. Nonetheless, the TV still wasn't working properly nor was the internet, and we couldn't watch a movie again. And the screen on the phone (which is like a mini computer screen) was supposed to automatically dim at around 9pm, but it didn't and it was so bright lighting up the whole room, we had to cover it with towels and a pillow. Also, there was a light bulb burnt out in one of the closets, and it is so dark in these rooms that we couldn't see what we had in there. They didn't replace that either and so we swapped the bulb from one closet to the other, but then the light wouldn't go out when we closed the door. That was probably why it burnt out in the first place. Also, our desk lamp was broken and just hanging off it's base...I was surprised they'd let it just hang like that and not fix it before occupying the room. The final thing was that the lounge wasn't open at all, so we couldn't sit in our hotel and have cocktails which was too bad. I handed a list of broken things to the front desk person when I checked out, and he just said sorry, and didn't offer up any sort of rebate or consolation for the shortcomings. I followed up when I got home with an email to the manager who'd left us the truffles, and he never replied to my email. I actually had to phone him a month later to ask him if he'd gotten my email, and he said sorry but he'd forgotten about it. He didn't offer and sort of consideration either. So although I love the hotel and the price point, I felt they could have given us a bit more consideration with either attempting to fix the broken TV/console/remote, or giving us another room, or some sort of discount on the room, or a discount on a future stay would've been fine too.
