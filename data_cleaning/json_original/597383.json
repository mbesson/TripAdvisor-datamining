The carpet right along the floor was raised in the middle which actually was quite dangerous as you could easily of tripped on it. It looked as though someone had punched a hole in the door and rather than being replaced a block of wood was just used to cover it. The toilet paper was far too cheap and I wish I had brought my own. The pillows were very thin and you only got one per person which made the sleeping situation rather uncomfortable The food ordered wasn't too bad and quite good value for money and the staff were pleasent and friendly.

On approach I noticed the huge ugly steam spewing factory across the road, as we arrived into the parking lot I noticed that directly behind the hotel was another horrendous 80s built and forgotten about factory with the very same name as the one I had just seen, What a great idea, build a Travelodge right in the middle the smell will hit and cling to the building on both sides !! The Entrance to the hotel or doss house it would be more aptly named was dirty, surely mops and buckets dont cost that much in Wembley! You have to pass one of the corridors on your way to Reception, the carpet that runs the length of the corridor had never been introduced to a hoover in its life, Im pretty sure the flee bitten thing is about to walk to the nearest skip by itself. Reception were friendly enough and announced that we should be staying on the 4th floor. So we thanked them for the 60 seconds of their time and allowed them to get back to doing the crossword or whatever it was they were doing before we arrived. As we waited patiently inline for the lift (only 1 of the 2 working, need i bother telling you and I have waited less time at theme parks for the rollercoaster) I noticed that all the other guests in the queue were male, i then realised that they were all workmen and thought it odd that with so many workmen around the place was clearly in such disrepair, (a lick of paint once a decade would certainly be an improvement) however it certainly explained why the carpets were full of cement and dirt from their dirty boots, then i realised as we all trotted along the corridor and many of them staggering that they were in fact guests of the hovel. Trying to keep our spirits up we opened the door to the room took a deep breath, and to my deepest joy and i nearly wept the bed was nice and clean, the bathroom acceptable and oh what luxury there was tea and coffee making facilities. But wait there was a great big hole on the bathroom door that had been patched up by someone whos motto must be \"Slap Dash earns the cash\" same guy had filled in the many holes in the walls. The ceiling was decorated by what I guess must have been a glass of red wine flung with some abandon upwards and left there to dry in. We dumped our stuff and headed back down stairs to enquire about internet and the nearest petrol station. We were met with a whole flock of work men, who were talking gingerly to their work mates who must have been given the day off and had spent their weeks wages in the pub. We were there for 30 minutes and it was like a YMCA men coming and going, Brining in their Asda shopping(I didnt realise Travelodge has the option of self catering) making phone calls back home to their wives just to keep up the weekly tradition of arguing. Others on their laptops the rest just supping their drinks and staring into their glass. I was the only female I saw the entire time. We paid 25 pound so we weren't expecting the Ritz, but we didn't want the YMCA either. Oh and did I mention that we had to pay for the parking in the hotels very own car park 5 quid for the pleasure.

Reading the reviews I imagined it to be a poor standard but because it had a carpark and easy to get to from where I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m located I thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d go for it. Now from where I live up the M1 it was easy to get to so that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big plus. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsecure\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 carpark is \u00c2\u00a35 daily and it pay and display. Doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem overly inforced by anyone though onsite so leeway I imagine is used if you are over you time. The carpark is not locked, it has a barrier but it looks like it has been broken off. The gate so you can not enter the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgrounds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is also never locked. I would advise if parking in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgrounds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 park as close the the major entrance as you can or something you can see from the bedroom. You can test your luck and park on the Rd, although I saw afew cars broke in there over the last 3 nights I was around the area, So I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it for sake of a fiver. The hotel is VERY basic. The staff are fine never had a problem with dealing with them face to face. Now the rooms are basic, if you get a room on the back side facing the river then its pretty quiet. The front of the hotel though is very noisy. Most rooms on the back will look out on Wembley. My room was cold, one little storage heater simply wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough. One pillow was supplied only. The shower was nice but the toilet didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t flush too well and the sink when emptying with water which took along time smelt very very bad, worse then a toilet would smell in a bad situation. Towels were also in short supply. 3 days past and non were given out. In the end had to get some from reception. The card entry to the room is a joke as it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work for longer then 20 minutes normally. So make sure you go to reception and get the room card redone when you arrive back in the hotel, they blame it on mobile phones being next to the card but this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t true as the card wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work within 20 minutes which within it was nowhere near anything else. The general feeling is the hotel is worn. Have been told its getting a big refurbish but I imagine it will lose a lot of custom before then. Location wise its between Stonebridge and HangerLane. Both are between a 12 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 17 minute walk with Stonebridge being a left turn out of the hotel and then follow the road. You go under several rail bridges but this never felt unsafe as there was always other people about. Hanger Lane is abit of a harder walk. From the station getyourself on the main road right away then head left walk down to the park head to the underpass and then entrance 5, then walk, you will see Travelodge in the distance on the left side of the road.

I knew the location of the hotel which was on the North Circular Road so this was not a suprise, the only good thing about the hotel is that there was no noise up on the 3rd floor where I was staying but other than that the stay was a huge dissappointment. The Receptionist on shift that checked me in was very polite... her name was Dimples and she was from India. She received me in a courteous manner, chatted a bit and wished me a good stay. Then when I got to the lift area there were 2 lifts, one out of order and second one that was on the 3rd floor. So I waited for it, at first I was alone but soon I was joined by 2 maids that were deep engaged in conversation in a foreign language, probably Polish but I can not be entirely sure. Even though I did say Good Afternoon to them I received no reply. When the lift opened up it was full of other maids and a laundry trolley/basket, the maids that were waiting for the lift with me jumped in and left me waiting for the lift to return as there was no space for myself and my 1 piece of hand luggage. I waited for a while and decided to take the stairs. The staircase was far from a hotel staircase that is open to public even though there was a big sign indicating where they were. The staircase was made red steel and there was a smell of chemicals in the air. When I reached the room I could see that the main door must have been broken in at some point in the past and never was fixed as I could see the door frame with splinters sticking out just next to the lock and handle. The bathroom door had some holes in it that had been covered up with a white/yellow paste and was never repainted. The bathroom seemed clean and there were 2 half used toilet paper rolls. The room seemed clean, and spacious, we had booked a Family room for 3 and it seemed okish. The 3 pillows however where paper thin (when in Edinburgh the pillows where full and round and soooo comfortable I thought that thas was there standards, I was wrong!). So I thought, lets go down and let Dimples know I would need more pillows, I jumped into the lift, yipee and asked Dimples if she could keep a few spare pillows that I would pick up in the night to take to the room but she offered to place them in the room if she found some, so that was a nice extra touch. In the evening I returned with my family and as soon as I got into the hotel I noticed a very strong smell of air freshner that was certainly not healthy for someone with Asthma like my mum who needed to reach for her inhaler. When we got to the room I found out that indeed they had left us another 2 paper thin pillows. The next morning we went out for the day and when we got back our key card was deactivated so I had to go down to activate it again, then when we got to the room we saw that they had changed our towels but nothing else was done, not even emptied our bins which were full. The following day we were getting ready at 9.30am and housekeeping started knocking on our door to service the room, we asked for them to return in 15 minutes and all were literally forced to take the towels into the room. In the evening the key card was not working again, even though it was in my bag where no mobile phone was kept and once in the room again no service was done, not even the old towels were removed or toilet paper replaced, which was needed. The same situation happened the following day and my family was even told that they were due to check out and to please leave the room, but only to find out that they had make a mistake. One of the evenings we asked the receptionist if we could please print of an important document as we had an appointment at the Embassy in the morning and we had been unable to print off from Ryman (printer out of order) and then from the internet caf\u00c3\u00a9 in Ealing (same reason) but we were told they could not insert any USB stick into their computers, so we asked if they could print it off from e-mail and they said they only had access to their intranet so we asked if we could send it to their work e-mail and they said they needed approval from their managar that was only going to be there at 9am, and our appointment was at 9.30 am at Holland Park so we would never have been able to make it. So no... I would NEVER reccommend this hotel, horrible service, no interest in helping guests whatsoever, one of the lifts remained ouf of service for the entire stay and there was not even a sign there to apologize. I can not believe the difference between this Travelodge and the one I stayed in Edinburgh, the one in Edinburgh was a place I would go back anytime and have recommended to everyone I know that was travelling there.

Initially the reviews did give us some concern however for one night stay we thought it was worth the risk as all the other local hotels were considerably more expensive. The hotel is very worn out and basic but clean which is all we wanted. Its located 10 min walk to Stonebridge Park tube station and a 40min walk to Wembley Stadium. A tip is if you turn left as you leave the hotel and walk for ten minutes, thsi should take you to Stonebridge Park Station and if you do the same to the right, this should take you to Hanger Lane Station which is a bit longer than 10 minutes. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel and we believe that when events are on all buses take a detour to Wembley from this stop which is handy. Rooms don't have an iron but can be asked for at reception. Rooms have tea making facilities but the road facing rooms can be quite noisy. All staff were extremely helpful, friendly and efficient. Hotel bar is reasonably priced and breakfast was standard but good. However the bar tables and chairs have seen better days so be careful. The only down side it that the area didn't appear to have many local bars or restaurants near by so when the hotel stops serving food your options are very limited if you require a late night snack. The car park appeared safe enough and priced at \u00c2\u00a35 for 24hrs. All in all this is a good place to stop for Wembley events for a single night but for anylonger and if you can spare a few more pennies I would suggested opting for a closer hotel.

The first thing I would say is the number of \"terrible\" reviews is not really justified. The hotel isnt fantastic, but some of the things people have complained about seem very picky to me. Some of the carpets have seen better days, but I never noticed any bad smells, and they seemed clean enough. We had a double room and a twin room - the double was a lot nicer than the twin which had a couple of light bulbs missing and a crack in the bathroom sink. They could have both done with a little bit of patching up here and there, but for a hotel on the edge of London, for the price I am sure there are worse places. I have to say that the staff were friendly and helpful, but I wasnt happy about having to pay an extra \u00c2\u00a310 to check in at 2pm rather than 3pm - surely if the room is already ready it would be much better customer service to just let you have it. I am not sure if this is the same with all Travelodges as this was our first stay in one. I was also surprised by a couple of reviews saying the area didnt fell safe. Myself, my wife and our two kids walked from the tube station at Hanger Lane between 11 and 11.30pm after a night at the theatre, and had no problems whatsoever. One thing I would say though is, unless I went completely the wrong way, it is not only a 10 minute walk as one reviewer said - I think Mo Farah would struggle to get there in 10 mins. I think 20-25 mins is more realistic, but its not too bad. The breakfast, which is served up to 12noon is certainly worth the money. It is a buffet style that is constantly topped up. The one main downside to the hotel is something that they cannot do anything about - its proximity to the North Circular. Where do people drive to at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning?? its just a constant noise. There is no way I would stay here in the summer with a chance I might have to have the window open as sleep would be impossible - it would be like sleeping on the central reservation of the M1!!

We booked two twin rooms last minute, so we (or rather our company) paid through the nose. \u00c2\u00a3260 for the four of us. If we'd paid \u00c2\u00a340 I might be less scathing about it, but still wouldn't be giving a good review. Sadly it was London Fashion Week when we had need to be in London, so our options were limited. The car park looks like something left over from the Cold War and the front of the building could be a prison with the barbed wire, high fences and concrete walls. Despite being fully booked, we managed to park easily although they charge you \u00c2\u00a35 per vehicle for 24hrs which seems somewhat outrageous! There is a cafe/bar here, and the stench of stale cooking oil and grease that emanates from it out into the carpark is appalling. Empty beer kegs were stacked up by the wall. On entering, my heart lifted slightly as the entrance was clean and tidy. The bar is reasonably stocked with alcoholic drinks of your choice and there is a wall with a number of vending machines - one for water, one for cans of fizzy pop and two more for snacks and the essentials that you may forget like a toothbrush or toothpaste. Check in was straight forward albeit that the two rooms which were on the same booking were inexplicably split so that one was on the first floor and the other on the fourth. In to the lift (clean enough on first inspection but the floor is actually in serious need of a scrub on hands and knees - not a swab with a mop) and up we went. The door popped open on the first floor to let some people out and the stench of stale, rotting carpet and furniture was atrocious. It smelt to me like there was a hot water leak somewhere (although that may actually have been because the whole place was overheated) which had permeated the carpets throughout the hallways and was now rotting the fixtures and fittings from the inside out. It was appalling. We carried on up to the fourth floor where the door opened to a normal clean-smelling hallway. Phew. The room was typically Travelodge basic, which was perfectly normal and acceptable. The bathroom was reasonably clean, but there was water damage across the ceiling from a recent looking leak. A clean single duvet on each bed and a solitary pillow about as thick as the palm of your hand. A card in the room said to ask at reception if you wanted another pillow. Other than that, it was generally fine. The temperature, however, was awful. The heating was off, but it was so stuffy that it was not bearable. The window only cracks open about two inches - no doubt to stop you throwing yourself out of it - so a breath of fresh air was impossible. The hotel is of course right on the Northern Circular, which essentially means a motorway passing about 20 yards from the windows. We knew about this and had brought earplugs in preparation, but you couldn't leave the window open to sleep. We left the window open as wide as we could (hardly at all!) and went out for the evening. On our return, I asked at reception for a round of four pillows (one each) but was told that the hotel was fully booked so they had none left. I don't really care whether or not they are fully booked - they should have sufficient bedding for each room. I then tried to get a bottle of water from the vending machine - completely empty. The bar do not sell soft drinks except as mixers. My only option for a soft drink was to pay \u00c2\u00a31 for a can of diet coke from another machine, which was lukewarm. My colleague then asked to buy a toothbrush as she'd forgotten hers and was directed to another machine. It was also empty. On asking again at reception, she was met with shrugs. On asking who was responsible for filling the machines, they shrugged again. A staff member then retrieved a packet of peanut M&M's and gave them to her by way of apology for being out of pillows, water and toothbrushes. It was a nice gesture, I'm sure, but I cannot see how it remotely related to the issues we had at that point! On going to the first floor in the morning to collect our colleagues on the way out, I was appalled to see the volume of wanton damage that has not been repaired and lack of care and attention by the hotel management. There were a number of fires that had been set at some point, up against doors and walls, damaging both the doors and the carpets. There were horrific looking stains on the carpets that could have been either vomit or faeces, judging by the colours. The carpets were lifting up and are filthy - I suspect that the water damage you can smell is linked to the carpets moving around like hair in a Timotei advert. The Ace Cafe (of motorbike fame) is a few minutes walk away and well worth a visit in my opinion! Stonebridge Park tube and railway station is about fifteen minutes on foot from the hotel and the Bakerloo Line will take you straight into the city centre in 29 minutes. I will be writing to the hotel management to complain, and more or less C&P'ing my review in the letter. The brand has a reasonably good reputation for good, basic, clean, standardised facilities.

Reading other peoples reviews i think we must of been lucky with the room we were given, the room and bathroom were clean and everything worked. However i would recommend people take an extra pillow with them as the ones they give are terrible and you may aswell rest your head on the mattress itself. There was a strange smell when we reached the fifth floor in which we were staying and stepped out of the lift, but that smell dissapeared once we were in our room. The housekeeping maids seemed very eager for us to leave the following morning even though the checkout time wasn't actually untill 12. Twice they knocked on our door asking if we were leaving yet. The first time at 9 i said we would be gone around half 11 in which they then asked if we could leave at 11 as everyone else wanted to leave at half 11 too. I said yes ok thats fine, then half an hour later they were back yet again asking us if were leaving yet. We felt very much pressured into then leaving.

Our second room was much better with a partition between the bed area and living area. the lliving area had a sofa bed and a pull out bed which was much nicer and also gave us and our children a bit of privacy. The tempertaure of the rooms was unreal, it was so hot it was hard to sleep, the windows only open approx 2 inches so you cannot cool them down. The level of clenliness throughout the whole of the hotel was sub standard, and decor very run down.

There were no extra pillows available so we having to fold up our towels under our pillows to be able to get comfortable.

However it was too late for us to change. When I arrived my fears to an extent were confirmed; the entrance and the one working lift was poor and when I went to the room I found that there was nowhere to hang clothes as the rails were missing, graffiti on the bathroom door, a taped over broken plug and most importantly a sofa bed which was to be used by my two grandchildren was not very clean and the bottom bed was missing. I immediately went to reception and spoke initially to the receptionist and then to the Hotel Manager. Initially they wanted us to change rooms but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to do this as it would separate us from my daughter and son in law and, as we had a room at the back of the hotel away from the traffic noise, there would be a risk on having a room at the front. We asked for z beds or simply a clean mattress to be placed on the floor and hotel manager said she would try to ensure that this was arranged. We then left to attend a wedding. 3 hours later we returned to check on progress and found to our satisfaction that 2 z-beds had been placed in the room. Contrary to many comments that we had read we found the staff that we came into contact with extremely helpful and they solved our problem. I think we had one of the better rooms judging by comments from some others in our party. The hotel is clearly not up to Travelodge standards and it needs a complete refurbishment. It is not in a good location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is a run down industrial area right beside the North Circular road and therefore the front side of the hotel is subject to continual noise from traffic.

With the window open, the noise is intolerable, and the window only opens about two inches. This is probably to prevent people from throwing themselves out. We could not hear the T.V., with the volume on full, because of the noise of the traffic, all night. The rooms are hot to begin with. After two people have showered, they become hot and very, very humid, because ventilation is so poor. Our room smelled of stale cigarette smoke, despite it being non-smoking. Only one side of the bed had bed side lighting. A makeshift light on the side of the wall did not work either. The T.V. remote control did not work, although a red light on it went on and off, so the batteries were OK. The pillows, 1 each, were as thin as communion wafers. Approaching the Travelodge is quite scary. Dilapidated buildings are in the immediate vicinity, and the hotel is tatty, surrounded by a blue wire fence. The hotel has a barrier controlled car park, the barriers to which have long since ceased to function. The 1Km walk to Stonebridge Park underground station is unnerving, especially late at night. This is a rough area of London. The hotel is NOT in Wembley, as advertised. Now, let's play the \"good thing game\" as I am a positive fellow: we didn't get mugged; the car wasn't broken into; the bedding was clean; the staff were mostly friendly; the shower stall was huge and didn't leak, and, best of all, we escaped with our lives.

We found a good rate for the Wembley Travelodge and booked it even though we knew we weren't going to be right in the Centre, believing there to be a tube station close by. What we hadn't anticipated was that the hotel itself was very hard to get to by foot as it is on the North Circular Road, one of the busiest dual carriageways in and out of London City. And also, the nearest tube station was actually a 25 minute walk away at Stonebridge Park, and getting to the hotel involved walking through a rather derelict and deserted industrial estate, so at night we didn't feel safe at all. The tube journey into Central London was a further 30/40 minutes so not ideal at all.

On arrival check in was quick and easy although we did need to go down to reception to 'update' our key card everyday. We stayed for 3 nights and towels and bedding was changed, bins emptied daily.

The cafe inside the Travelodge didnt have a huge selection but again it looked fine if your only staying for a couple of days. We cant comment on the food as we went elsewere.

We wanted something that was not too expensive and close to the Stadium and surrounding bars. We paid \u00c2\u00a336 for one night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay, this worked out to be the cheapest of all the hotels in Wembley, however not the closest by far. According to their site the hotel is 1 mile away from the stadium which is possibly correct if travelling in a straight line, however in-between the hotel and Wembley is a train line that of course you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cross, so to get there you have to go up along the North Circular road and then go under the tracks and then back track on yourself, possibly adding an extra mile, so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re walking which we did it take aprox 30 - 45 min. The hotel have however got a set fare deal with a local Taxi company at \u00c2\u00a38, they are pretty reliable as well normally there in about 5 mins of you calling. The hotel is right next to the North Circular road so is really easy to find but be warned there is nothing around it, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the middle of an industrial estate. The hotel its self in real need of updating, the corridor floors where old and tired, the grouting in the tiles dirty and one of the lifts out of order, however the room we stayed in 110 Family room was very big and clean. The shower was hot and powerful and the bed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where comfortable, again though a new lick of paint would not go a miss. There was plenty of tea and coffee available in the room and of course a kettle for making it, TV and towels where also available. One thing that was not in the room however was a telephone to call reception, so when I wanted an extra blanket I had to walk down to ask, which they gave with no issues, however it would have been better to have called down. The breakfast is not included in the price and costs \u00c2\u00a37.65 per person, 6.65 if you book in advance, however 15 and under get it free, they have a great selection available, Bacon, sausage, beans, egg, tomatoes, cereal, toast, tea and coffee etc, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all help yourself and you can eat as much as you like, as we had a long drive back to Whitley Bay we decided to fill our boots. One other thing is parking, it is available at \u00c2\u00a35 for 24 hours, however the main street just outside has no parking restrictions and its pretty safe to park there, however space is limited so get you space early. I would stay here again however not if am going to Wembley stadium due to the distance away, but overall it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good place and come recommended.

When we asked the lady at the reception any question, the answer was always ' I dunno' . One of the lady's at the reception went to look for an iron and came back with no luck. She said that 'people take the irons home' and she was so blase about it, as if that was a reasonable and acceptable answer for a customer. Every question was answered with an unacceptable answer e.g. 'I dunno.' The window in my room was covered with black tape to stop the wind or something and it looked awful!

I would have followed suit if it was not going to be so expensive. Another thing that I have to note is that the carpet in the lobby was not sitting properly, in fact it is illegal to have carpet like that, as it is a trip hazard.

We asked about parking - we were told we could park in the car park for \u00c2\u00a35. The machine only takes cash - we had notes - asked for change and were told no. We decided to go into London for a couple of hours. The nearest tube (Stonebridge Park) is a good 10 minute walk through a pretty run down, abandoned and generally horrid area! It takes 30 mins on this to get into London. At 2pm we came back and hoped to check in (1 hour early). We waited for ages whilst the same man told 2 lads infront of us they weren't allowed to check out and leave any luggage at the hotel whilst they went out. During this time I particularly enjoyed watching the other woman behind the desk ignore the growing queue and also the 3 members of staff SITTING on chairs around the snack machine having a jolly good time watching people come in and out of the hotel!! He then told us again no, we can't check in, we're too early for the room. But then a few minutes later declared if we paid him \u00c2\u00a310 we could in fact have a room!!!

Not even a sniff of any toiletries and also no hair dryer. Breakfast was ok, but you sit in a dirty area. I was so happy to be leaving the next day.

(bearing in mind this was also more expensive than the Holiday Inn. i know Travelodge is supposed to be budget value - but for he prices charged here it should be better. Other budget chains are FAR FAR superior). If you are visiting London my advice is definitely choose something like the Holiday Inn at Watford and avoid this area at all costs. If you have to come here as you are visiting Wembley, as we did, check out other options first. This should be your last choice!!

This was annoying but - well - most of us have been a bit worse for wear on a Friday night before! The second night was an entirely different matter. My husband and I were really scared and ended up sneaking out at about 6:30am, having had very little sleep at all. I'm not exaggerating to say that our floor was populated by gangsters (or wannabe gangsters): blokes were pacing up and down, banging doors and looking for money, and we heard lots of noisy talk about crack, threats to shoot people or scalp people, frantic phonecalls about girls being kidnapped.

Our thoughts were that the police should have been called.

The bathroom wasn't as clean as I would have liked, the shower was blackened with mould and there was a big crack running down the centre of the sink. When we decided to head to bed, we realised that the window in the room wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fully shut. This was bought to the attention of the staff at reception who told us that there were no other rooms available because the hotel was fully booked that night. So our only option was to spend the night with the duvet cover over our heads in order shield ourselves from the draft coming in through the window. As you can imagine, the next day we awoke feeling worst for wear and with a head cold. My friends who were staying in rooms 205 and 206 were kept up all night by a neighbouring room which seemed to have 7+ people staying in it. They were playing load music, slamming doors, shouting/talking loudly and smoking cannabis in the room and in the corridor all night. After numerous complaints to the room and four trips downstairs to make complaints to the hotel staff on the front desk, it was 7.30am before they were finally asked to leave the hotel. I thought that there was no way this hotel stay could get any worse, sadly I was wrong! We checked out of the hotel at midday the next afternoon and walking to the car (which was in the hotel car park for which I had paid \u00c2\u00a35!) we realised that the passenger side window had been smashed and the car had been broken into. We went back into the hotel and were handed the phone to contact the police. When we asked if any other cars had been broken into we were told that a total of three cars (including mine) had been targeted. The hotel staff did not appear to be surprised in the slightest! With a 106 mile journey ahead of us and no call-out services available to put even a temporary fix on the window, we found the hotel staff (including the manager) to be absolutely useless. In the end we left the hotel with a makeshift window made from cling film (which we had to go out and purchase ourselves after being told that the front desk staff/manager had no access to kitchen), plastic bags and cello-tape.

We stayed here for one night to save driving home after a concert at Wembley stadium. I wish id driven home! The hotel itself is in dire need of a makeover, the reception area is tired, very basic and just generally not very pleasant (stained carpets, tacky floors etc). The stairway offers little encouragement en route to your room, dirty carpets giving way to plain metal steps and the sense of using the stairs in a multi storey car park. The rooms themselves are clean and tidy, but its in the rooms that the main problem with this hotel is to be found. NOISE and plenty of it, the traffic outside is relentless (we saw less traffic on the M1 on our journey home) and it feels (and sounds) like your sat right on top of it. The glazing is simply insufficient to shield even the worst of the noise. Ive stayed in noisy hotels before with slamming doors and noisy lift mechanisms etc but this place takes the biscuit. Even with ear plugs in (purchased hastily in London having realised how bad it is after our arrival) the noise was ridiculous. The traffic never stops and the noise is unremitting. Unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the sort of person who can sleep through a herd of trumpeting elephants then steer clear. If your lucky enough to get a room on the other side of the hotel you may find the noise isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem, im guessing that it may be a bit better there, but cant say for sure as despite asking to be moved, there were no rooms available on that side for us to move to. In terms of location, this hotel is approx 2 miles from Wembley stadium, not too difficult to get back to after a concert at the hallowed ground you may think\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Well 3 hours after the concert finished we eventually made it back. You could probably walk it in less than that but id advise against it as the area doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem the safest and a lot of the route is along dual carriageway without pavement. We left Wembley stadium pretty swiftly and were funnelled down the main concourse towards Wembley Park tube station along with 90,000 other people. Mounted police hold the crowd back as the station obviously couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cope with everyone flooding in all at once. It ended up taking a good half hour to get to the station (usually about 10 mins walk). If your going to an event at Wembley you may be interested to know that there were literally no taxis around (not even occupied ones). We tried ringing one and the firm advised that there just weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any in the area as it was so busy. We also tried getting to a bus but found the queues just as bad. So the only option left was the tube, usually im happy to travel on the underground, but the real pinch here is that to get the 2 miles back to the Travelodge on the tube, you have to go all the way into central London, change lines twice (first at Baker Street, then at Bond Street) to come all the way back out again. Its then a ten min walk from Hangar Lane station back to the Travelodge and the comfort of your noisy hotel room. Also, I could be wrong, but I strongly suspect that the train out of Wembley Park has no engine and is in fact pulled by a horse. Of course Travelodge aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t responsible for such transport difficulties or the volume of people trying to get out of Wembley after an event, but its something to consider if your thinking of staying here after a concert of event of some kind. You may want to think twice before booking in here as its very difficult to get back to and its not the best of hotels in the first place. Given the transport chaos after a Wembley event, its easier to get into central London than it is to get back to the Travelodge. You may even want to think about driving (there were queues to get out of the car park, but I doubt anyone queued for 3 hours!). In the interests of fairness I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say that the staff at the Travelodge were all friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and we parked easily (we arrived approx 12.30). Travelodge do also refer to the road noise on their website, but all in all this is a poor hotel in a poor location.

I was very worried after reading the reports about it on here. Although I know Wembley area well, (being born and bred in Watford), my husband and I were coming from East Yorkshire, (by train), where we live now, and haven't visited this area for at least 10 - 15 years. The hotel is a 10 - 15 minute walk from Stonebridge Park station, and not in a pretty area. However, the staff were welcoming and efficient. The reception was clean, as was the bar area , considering the hotel was full of Muse fans! (We are both over 45 years old.) The bedroom we had was on the 6th floor, and was very clean and comfortable, with tea/coffee making facilities. The en-suite bathroom was very clean, with lovely soft ,fluffy white towels!! There was a T.V., but we never tried it. I can't comment on the food, because we chose not to eat there, but there seemed to be a lot of people having breakfast in the morning, and a lot of people were ordering pizza deliveries, even after the gig. The bar was still open and very busy when we got back at midnight...and was still going when we went up to our room at 1am. We walked to Wembley stadium. It took us about 30 minutes walking briskley. I had been worried about walking back at night, but needn't have worried as there were loads walking back to the hotel, and we just fell in with them. However, I had researched bus routes on-line and there is plenty of scope for bus journeys if that's your thing. The only thing I feel I ought to comment negatively on is the sound of the traffic outside. Our room was at the front of the hotel and my husband had a poor sleep due to it, but, because I wear a hearing aid, when I took it out, I could barely hear it, and slept very well!! The bed was very comfortable, with a decent thickness of mattress, and no plastic sheet that I had read of in other reviews. Overall, this hotel is perfectly adequate for a short stay, the staff were polite and respectful, and I can't understand the horribly negative reports of some of the previous reviews. It's fine.

As I normally do when a hotel is booked on my behalf, I went on the web site for the Travelodge at Wembley before I set off from the office to accommodation. It did make clear that the hotel was on a major road and from this I inferred that it may be a bit noisier than normal. However my past experiences of Travelodge have been good so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry! How wrong I was! If there had been signs around the hotel saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153refurbishing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I may have understood the poor quality of the decoration and the general feeling of shabbiness and dirt that existed. However there were no such signs so I can only assume that the owners were happy with the general cleanliness of the hotel. As someone who has been used to spending up to 50 nights a year away in hotels, I was not happy! Upon arrival I was directed to room 6 on the ground floor. The corridor to the room was a disgrace, old dirty worn carpet and all sorts of marks on the walls. On entering the room the bed looked as though someone had been laying on it, the carpet was filthy, the window was missing a handle with which to close the window and the air conditioning unit was not working \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153error P4\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And there was no remote control for the TV! I went back to the reception and had a difficult conversation with a trainee with only very broken English, who told me that there was no air conditioning in the room, that I should use the special slot by the door to insert the key card and thus work the air-conditioning(!), that this was a special room as, because the room was on the ground floor it was protected from the noise of the road(these are my words-it took much longer to ascertain this!) and that there were no more rooms available on the ground floor. I was given the keys to room 415 and upon arrival at that room noticed the police further along the corridor taking photographic evidence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c presumably the scene of a crime. I was by this stage feeling particularly nervous! This room was much better decorated but with no sound insulation and no air conditioning unit was again deemed unacceptable. (I was keen for some form of air-con as the evenings were humid and the only ventilation would be from opening the window \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which was not possible because he noise from the traffic was so loud!) Upon my third visit to the reception I was given the key to room 8 on the ground floor - where there were no rooms left! Again a very tired and dirty room and the air con didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work, although they did provide me with fan. When I asked for an ironing board and iron I was asked by the receptionist if I would prefer a sheet and I could then iron on the floor or on the unit worktop. I declined and was provided with a sheet to accompany the ironing board which had no cover! The bed was particularly uncomfortable, a heavy plastic sheet between the mattress and the sheet making for an unpleasant night and there were no extra pillows in the room. Breakfast the next morning was in the main dining area which is surrounded by the most filthy glass walls looking out onto the north circular. Those glass walls didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look as though they had been cleaned in a very long time. The food was inedible, the plates and cutlery dirty and the doors leading to the kitchen were that shabby that they looked as though they had been there a very long time. The pillars in the dining room looked as though they had not been decorated in a long long time too! I have only ever complained about a hotel once before and it takes a lot for me to lose my cool with hotel staff who are normally doing the best they can in trying circumstances. This Travelodge looks like it has been the victim of severe cost cutting initiatives from head office, without any thoughts given on how those cuts would impact upon clients.

The hotel is also set in an industrial estate on the north circular and beware, that from the 5th floor you can see into some of the factory windows, so I guess they can see you too! Pillows are wafer thin indeed, so take you own! The state of repair is really bad, already mentioned by many on here! The place needs a proper refurb. It is the worst travelodge I have seen. There are some good ones and and this is a real let down. A lot of the rooms have problems and we actually stayed in three different rooms during our visit because each one had problems like no hot water, no curtains (sellotaped remnants only!) etc. Each time we complained we were actually offered one of our previous rooms again, and I knew nothing had been fixed as it was the weekend when no repairs took place. There is also only one working lift for the 7 storey building as the other one has been awaiting repair for some time. It can be a long wait at busy times. The car park is not safe. Cars get broken into there. It is about 10 mins walk to the nearest tube. Stonebridge park should be avoided at night. Hangar lane is slightly further but safer as it is a bit busier. The walk is alongside the north circular past several factories and it is not pleasant. Oh and the smell of cannabis smoke on most floors and even the non smoking rooms! When there is a problem, the worst thing is you have call an 0845 number from your mobile to speak to reception (no internal phone around), and the only solution is to change rooms which we did twice, which is a pain as you can't ever properly unpack. The first time we moved, they shifted our things for us but managed to lose one of my shoes in the process, so we did it ourselves the second time. I went to reception a couple of times about this as I had no other formal shoes and you get responses like 'we'll check'....'yes we found it, didn't we return it?'....'the cleaner should have put it in your room'....etc and eventually someone handed it to me from behind the counter on my penultimate day! Complaining falls on deaf ears. I have yet to hear from Travelodge HQ....when you google them, they don't appear to have much customer service anyway! All in all, you will be ok if you get a room at the back and everything works in the room. If also you pay a rock bottom price, I guess this is where good reviews will come from.

We found our way to Hanger Lane tube station easily, only to emerge from the station onto a multiple lane very busy junction/roundabout/pedestrian subway which did not tally with the easy-to-find, only half a mile away travelodge we were expecting. We walked for about a mile on what we were led to believe was north circular road and eventually found a newsagents to ask for directions, only to be told that this was totally wrong. We got on the recommended bus into Wembley and found (yes another!) newsagents where we asked for directions, only to be told that there was no way that it was within easy walking distance, a definite taxi job, and that it couldn't be walked from Hanger Lane either as it was situated at the side of a busy A road (A406) and you had to cross multiple busy junctions to get there. At least one of the locals knew where it was situated. Obviously it is not 'easy to find' if no locals (including the bus drivers!) know its location. So...when we finally arrived at the travelodge (3 hrs later), we checked in and were given a room key that didn't even work, and the dumb receptionist didn't believe us, even though we saw that she had to try 6 or 7 more keys before she gave us our replacement one. The reception was very shabby, with the carpet behind the counter visibly stained and stuck together with duct tape in several places! The room was ok, very basic, stained carpets, but 2 single beds, not the double bed as promised on the website. We didn't have time to complain about this so just gave in and accepted and went to our concert. I have to say that this is most definitely the worst travelodge I have ever stayed in and I certainly won't be returning there.

The walk to Stonebridge park is a mere 10 minutes and there you can join the Bakerloo line reaching Central London within 15 minutes. I recommend buying an adult travelcard from the station which costs around \u00c2\u00a35.50 and gives you unlimited travel throughout the tube network after 9.30am.

We didn't sample the restaurant preferring to eat whilst either out on our travels or at the fabulous Ace Cafe down the road (dont be put off by the reviewer who stated it was full of scary bikers!

Cost was just \u00c2\u00a329. I must admit reviews are patchy for this hotel and you can see why. On very early arrival (11.30am) we went into reception to inform them about our booking and to mention we had left our car on the car park. We had hoped for an early check in, but \u00c2\u00a310.00 extra from midday on a booking that only cost \u00c2\u00a329.00 seemed silly, so we headed to Central London and had a good afternoon sightseeing. On our return early evening, we checked in ok but were given no details of breakfast, car parking charges or basic information. Just a \"your room number is\" ticket and told where the lifts were. Ok, no problems, we needed a quick turnaround to get back out for the gig. Unfortunately when getting to our room we found we only had 2 pillows for 3 people. My Wife headed back down to reception where the staff were less than helpful, and only the quick thinking of a Chef of all people, managed to source two more pillows. Not ideal, 5 pillows between 3 people and very poor soft quality. I vowed to get some more later when we got back from the gig. The room itself was large, certainly for a Travelodge and I seem to remember this property used to be a Holiday Inn or HI Express. One real downside to the room is that Travelodge have obviously ripped out the old Holiday Inn beds (which were king sized it looks like) and replaced them with their standard Travelodge double bed. No real issues with that, except when you see where the light switches and bedside cabinets are located, it is practically impossible to reach them. Small detail and minor gripe maybe, but still not the best bit of renovation in my eyes. The sofa bed was ok, a bit grubby but my Brother didn't have any issues with it. The bathroom was fine, small but functional. The shower was pretty good to be honest but quite why there was no second part to the shower screen I do not know, which meant spray water went all over the bathroom floor. Still, it was better than average for a Travelodge. Location. Not good. The hotel is about ten minutes brisk walk to Stonebridge Park Underground Station (Bakerloo Line and then 30mins into London) up a quite unpleasant road which runs parallel to the A406 North Circular. We walked to the Underground and back twice in one day and although during the day it was quite busy and there were a few people about, come the late evening it was very quiet and very dark. We were a group of three people so didn't feel particularly at risk, but in no way would I recommend that walk to a solo traveller late in the evening. It is also worth pointing out that we saw one car that had been broken into (brick through window) and also glass scattered in various parts where no doubt other cars had been broken into. This also applies to the free car parking on the road right outside the Travelodge, where just a few short steps from reception glass was everywhere. Park in the Travelodge car park and pay the fee, it will be worth it. The main purpose of our stay was the FA Trophy Final at Wembley and why we booked this hotel. The walk to Wembley took about 40mins (up the same road, past Stonebridge Park and then up Harrow Road). It was daylight and it is not a bad walk to be honest, but there are much closer hotels to Wembley itself. If you can get a \u00c2\u00a319 or \u00c2\u00a329 deal it would be fine, but don't pay anything like the normal rack rate if Wembley is your main reason for staying. As others have pointed out there are no real options for food or drink around the area. The \"world famous\" Ace Cafe is about 5mins walk from the hotel (on the same road I mentioned earlier) but I wouldn't recommend this unless you are into bikes and lots of revving of engines. Get past that and the food might be an option, but there were 50+ bikers hanging around and it didn't look that welcoming to us. There is a garage across the A406 (right opposite the Ace Cafe) which you could probably walk to at a push (not far away, but busy roads) and after Stonebridge Park you get to Harrow Road where there is an Irish pub and lots of shops. Nothing special though. Breakfast is \u00c2\u00a37.50 and is a help yourself buffet which I must admit was quite impressive. Plenty of hot and cold options and always kept filled up by the far better morning staff. Parking is \u00c2\u00a35 per 24 hours I think. I wouldn't know for sure because we were not informed at check in and basically had free car parking because they leave the out gate open at most times (great security). Signs around the hotel indicate thieves work in the area and not to leave anything visible in the car. I think this is sound advice, especially as none of the security features of the hotel seemed to be in use during our stay (front gate key entry, car park gate as mentioned). Oh, I almost forgot the extra pillows. Arrived back at 11pm on Friday night and requested two more pillows to make it two pillows each in a family room only to be told they had run out. Great. Overall, 2 may seem a bit harsh. I would say our experience was somewhere between a 2 and 3. Pricewise it was a good deal and breakfast was excellent, but you have to take into account the slack evening staff, poor overall location (just about ok for Wembley, but no way Central London) and the room renovations which leave you having to get out of bed to switch a bedside light off!!! I won't be returning (try the Ibis for Wembley) and I won't be recommending either BUT, at \u00c2\u00a319 or \u00c2\u00a329 it could still be suitable for some people.

The only downside is the area, certainly not the kind of place you want to be walking on your own after nightfall. I would avoid walking to Stonebridge Park station at any time of the day, due to the large amount of \"gangs\" which appear to hang around under the railway bridges. If you must travel around after nightfall, I recommend getting the 112 bus to either Stonebridge Park station or walk under the subway to the opposite side of the road and get the 112 bus to Hanger Lane Station (Best option in my opinion, Central Line train direct to Tottenham Court Road!). No problem with the noise of the North Circular even though my room was facing it - Simply closed the windows and the curtains and had no problems at all! - Even sleeping right next to the window!

The window didn't shut properly, the extractor fan didn't work, the flush on the toilet was like spitting at a rottweiler. The Cafe-Bar was neither a cafe nor a bar. It had just three main courses on offer of the eight on the standard menu, with the five - shall we say - 'land based meat' options oddly all unavailable. The Bar had the first four choices of drink out of stock to the point they couldn't even charge me \u00c2\u00a32.90 for the advertised 440ml can (yes, can) of Strongbow that would have cost 60p from a supermarket. Most people would book this hotel to go to Wembley Stadium/Arena as I did. I'll echo the advice of others to be wary of the night. Leaving the Travelodge on foot there is about a third of a mile of abandoned buildings that have waste, graffiti, and broken windows. At night, roving groups of hoodies wander round with their faces hidden. You'll be OK in a group, as I was, otherwise spend the tenner on a taxi just for your own sanity. Having said that, with the lack of options available at the hotel, we ventured onwards very early to find food and drink. The Ace Cafe, about 1/3mile further along the road towards the stadium, is fantastic. Realistically priced good - simple - food. We also picked out a small family run Irish bar further on the route to the stadium. I forget the name, but we spent six hours in there happily and at very reasonable prices. I expect one thing of a Travelodge, being a budget hotel, and that is of a decent night's sleep. I've been in Travelodges all over the country and had fine nights on the side of usually deafening motorways. This one failed badly, on both nights. Even on the discounted price I had the room for it was poor value. Better soundproofing, and better management, would do this place no harm.

The location is also dreadful if you aren't in a car (car parking is \u00c2\u00a35, or free on the road outside). The hotel is located in a kind of no-mans-land, beside lots of factories.

I did take note of booking rooms at the back and am glad we did, due to the noise at the front.

The room was small but clean with twin beds, a TV (no radio on it) and shower in the bathroom. Minor gripes - no shampoo or body wash oin the shower and my bedside light didn't work. A \u00c2\u00a35 car parking fee was charged, which I thought was a bit of a swizz \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially as everywhere in the car park exclaimed how it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153car crime hotspot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and I would be lucky to wake up in the morning with my set of wheels! Breakfast was \u00c2\u00a37.50 but children under 10 each free with a paying adult. This worked out well with both my daughter and i stuffing ourselves so that we didn't even have to eat lunch. Word of Warning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Travelodge is situated about halfway between 2 underground stations (Hanger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Land and Stonebridge). It states that it is half mile to each \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is more - a big difference when you are walking to them on a hot day with a young child! (The area you walk through is a bit dodgy too). There is a bus that you can catch outside though that is well worth using. Overall, i was impressed and got good value for money. I wouldn't stay here for the full advertised price of \u00c2\u00a360 a night but for a special Travelodge rate of \u00c2\u00a326 - i would definitely stop again.

Booked twin bedded room GBP26 and breakfast 6.75 each which compares with 7.50 for breakfast if not pre-paid on the internet. Arrived at 3.30. Booking in was slow and while the receptionist's command of English was reasonable, she gave us the wrong room at first, mixing us up with other guests who had pre-booked. giving us twice as many breakfast vouchers as we had paid for. We decided to pay \u00c2\u00a35 for secure parking until we left the following late afternoon, in the hotel's gated and fenced car park I have seen previous comments about noise from the North Circular. Our room was on the first floor at the front but with the window closed the noise was not loud enough to stop us getting to sleep. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. We had evening meals in the bar cafe. Of the five different paninis on the menu only one was available. Not a good omen. We ordered a mixed starter to share, which should have come with chilli and sour cream dips but arrived with no sour cream dip. When I queried this with the waitress I was cheerily told it was \"finished\". We were too tired to argue/complain. The main meals were ok. We had no desert. In the morning after \"as much as you can eat\" buffet breakfast, clearing the room and packing the car, we walked to Stonebridge Park tube station and bought off peak one day travelcards for \u00c2\u00a35.70 each, so that we could use the tube, surface rail or buses to reach our destination in London and return to Stonebridge Park. We kept our room key card to enable us to exit the car park on our return.

Our room was dusty and there was a patched hole in the wall. That night we slept badly but we put it down to tiredness and waking up early. On the second night we decided to go to bed around 22:30 to get some sleep but just after midnight we were woken up by children running up and down the corridor. After about 1/2 hour my partner decided to complain but the adult playing chase with the children reply was: \"it is her birthday\". They did quiet down after 1 hour.
