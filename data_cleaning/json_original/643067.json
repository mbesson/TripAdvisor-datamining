The hotel is well positioned in a good area and surrounded by various restaurants and a major shopping street. Close by are shops where you can buy snacks and drinks to take back to your room if you want. The staff all spoke good English (if that's important for you) and were always polite and ready to help. At check in I was given an upgrade to Premium and the room was clean and well appointed, I had absolutely no complaints. I was on the 2nd floor but didn't notice any noise from other rooms or from the street below. I ate breakfast each day on the top floor restaurant that has a magnificent view over Istanbul, and also at the hotel restaurant which serves good Turkish food. They made every effort to accommodate my requests (e.g. can I have chicken and chips!) despite the fact they were not on the menu! Room service was good with meals taking around 20 mins to arrive. The food was good and I found the cost for room service to be outstanding. I had some difficulties connecting to the internet from my room but a brief phone call to reception quickly got me the help I needed. Well done Eresin Taksim, I will definitely stay again.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palma de Mallorca, Spain", "Title": "\u201cCorrect hotel, well situated and clean\u201d", "Author": "jemrec", "ReviewID": "UR124881870", "Content": "I have been two times in this hotel in 2011.

Our first two nights were in room 112. The small room had no closet or drawers, so the suitcases had to be open in the middle of the floor. There was also no light, so we kept stepping on our stuff because in the evening when there was no daylight, you really couldn't see with the extraordinary low light in the room. We asked for a lamp, they said they didn't have any, so they changed our room. The staff at the hotel, except for Mr. Yasar, were nice and helpful. I made it clear that my husband could not tolerate a room with cigarette smoke due to asthma, and I was told we were moving to a nonsmoking room, room 214. When we briefly entered the room during the day, the porter commented on the smell in the room, and opened the window. We left immediately to go out after bringing our luggage to the room. We returned to the room that evening . The room had a smoky/chemical smell in it. We tried to air it out repeatedly. My husband's asthma became increasingly bad, and by 1am, he couldn't breath and moved to the hallway. The front desk staff noticed him in the hall, and invited him to sleep in the lobby. They did not offer another room, though there may not have been one available. He spent a few hours on the couch in the lobby, and then people came in smoking. He moved to the breakfast room until about 3:30am. Then we went back to the lobby, which was still too smoky, and the porter at the front desk, trying to be helpful, suggested a conference room. Around 4 or so in the morning, my husband was on the floor of the conference room trying to sleep; they brought him a blanket. Needless to say, it was a terrible night. I went to the lobby to discuss the situation with a manager. Mr Yasar said he was the manager, and another staff member had a questioning look on their face, so I tried to clarify this with him. When discussing the terrible night we had, Mr. Yasar just kept insisting it was a nonsmoking room. That is really not relevant when the room smells so terribly. I don't care if it was supposed to be nonsmoking, clearly someone smoked quite a lot in there. Anyway, he said he couldn't give any credit to our credit card because we paid in advance. We paid over $600 for three nights. Then he proceeded to collect the 2 days of internet payment. It is difficult to describe the condescending tone he took with me. He refused to give me any direct contact information to speak with a manager. He was terribly rude. He did take my contact information to give to a manager, but I never heard from anyone. Soon after, we were in the lobby leaving, and my husband politely said \"thank you\" to the desk staff, and instead of apologizing to him for the terrible night he had, Mr. Yasar asked me \"can you tell me compliments you have for us.\" Compliments? I spent most of the night awake worrying that we were going to end up at the hospital due to my husband's inability to breathe, and he wants compliments? My husband was still coughing, and he wants compliments? I would have given the hotel a higher rating if not for the terrible service of the upper staff. The porters were quite nice and trying to be helpful. After my stay, I never heard from anyone. I emailed the hotel twice. Then I contacted Best Western. The hotel still didn't respond to me, but did lie to Best Western saying that they offered us a suite repeated, but we refused! Saying my husband CHOSE TO SLEEP ON THE FLOOR OF A CONFERENCE ROOM!! They also lied and said that the lobby was nonsmoking and just not big enough to satisfy my husband! This makes no sense! I am so infuriated by them! Lying about us and being so rude in person.", "Date": "February 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuwait", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel and Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Ali04", "ReviewID": "UR23303566", "Content": "For a family with children this hotel is a good option. we asked for a two big rooms, since there is some small rooms in the hotel.

We enjoyed both the hotel and the surroundings - full breakfast included in the rate - served in the top floor restarant with a magnificent view on the city, quick and accurate room service and housekeeping. Tiny streets leading to the square - variety of cafes, small shops accompanied by the smell of traditional turkish delights.

I have been booked for 5 nights here through a website i found on the net. The management was kind enough to arrange for an early checkin for my family as we arrived at the hotel, as requested a day prior to our arrival. However the building certainly sprung up some disorientation as two hotels are stuffed into one building - the eresin taxim premier and the eresin best western taxim - something which had never even been hinted to potential guests pre-arrival. The hotel lacks sophistication and automatic lighting in the hallways just add to the plain and character-less hallways. I had been booked into 1 twin and 1 double room on the 10th floor - which i believe was the highest. However the size of the room was a disgrace to the hotel - just enough to fit in a bed and an open cupboard. After an hour of complaining and checking out about 5 rooms across the entire hotel we managed to get two twin rooms on the 5th floor - which were about double the size of the first two on the 10th floor. The impression I got was that the managment were trying to get away with giving the small rooms out, unless the guests complained to which they would slowly introduce rooms of larger sizes. As I had booked the superior or deluxe rooms, they came with lcd philips about 30-35\" tv's and a dvd player which as far as I can see right now in both rooms has not even been connected the either tv. Their are a mere 23 channels offered inhouse - cnn,bbc and cnbc being the only three being in english. Therefore there is absoloutley no point in having such good class televisions. The sight of repairmen working on the chandelier in the main lobby was absoloutly revolting at noon, a time when the space is meant to be most used. The reception does help in explaining sights to see nearby but aren't keen on it and easily slip away to have a chat with their collieuges whilst talking to guests - disrespectful. Breakfast here is till 10:30, a desent time yet lacks the variety expected in even the smallest 4 star hotel. Housekeeping was dissapointing - bathroom floor still wet after cleaning and shampoo's and soaps missing on many days. Room floor not cleaned or sweeped at all during my stay and glasses not replaced. DISGUISTING STANDARDS The location of the hotel is the only major positive feature possesed by this hotel. It is in walking distance from the famous taxim square and taxi, bus and metro stops. The district is warm and seems safe as women are seen to be travelling alone and I myself was out in taksim square and the hotel area with my family late at night - around midnight without any appearant problems at all. It is a 3 star service standard hotel with useless lcd tv's in their best rooms.
