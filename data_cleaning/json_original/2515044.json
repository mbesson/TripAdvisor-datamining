Went there with my wife for anniversary weekend because I wanted to try it. The rooms are listed as 500 sq ft on Expedia, but live a lot smaller. Lots of wasted space in bath and in room, with only one easy chair and one small desk/desk chair. No love seat or coffee table, not a good layout for hanging out in the room reading paper, drinking coffee, facing one another. Service was very good, the bed was great, we enjoyed both the historic bar and restaurant Juno on 1st floor. Free newspapers including Sunday in the bar/lobby. While the location is well south of downtown and Pike Place Market, still very walkable, and equidistant to International District and Pioneer Sq., ferries, stadiums. Suggestion for breakfast - go out walking about four short blocks to Grand Central Bakery in Pioneer Sq on 1st Ave for outstanding fresh croissants with jam and/or pecan sticky buns. Open early, even on Sun. Eat there or bring back to enjoy w French press coffee in your room. The minibar fridge in room has enough space for leftovers from your dinner out, another nice amenity. Room also has DVD player. Bring your Netflix envelopes if you think you'd fancy a night in.

I found all of the hotel staff to be very friendly and accommodating.

Also received a $12/ day breakfast allowance which made for a nice breakfast each morning. The hotel bed was also very comfortable. The onsite restaurant, Juno, is not bad, but is also nothing super special. I would say it is standard hotel food; no better, no worse. The front desk staff and the all of the gentlemen at the concierge desk were very helpful. I was super impressed with just how genuine everyone seemed. It was evident to me that this property really stresses customer service with their staff. For anyone concerned about hotel security, this is the place to stay. Anything above the 3rd floor requires a hotel key for entry 24/7. Staff is always present and would immediately recognize anything out of the ordinary. Lastly, as a word of caution, the hotel is on a bit of an incline, so walking to and from in the area is taxing for someone not accustomed to walking much.

The decor was very stylish but also very comfortable. We had a room on the top floor with a sort of balcony that was on the roof with a great view of the city.

The in-room amenities included a full set up to make french press coffee and a minibar. The bath had gorgeous tile.

The location is great - close to transit stops, but I simply walked everywhere. I had only one meal there --- some late-night room service, and I even Facebooked to my friends how innovative and tasty that one silly snack was! Highly recommended. I can't speak to any of the other amenities of the hotel (fitness room, restaurant, bar, etc). What I particularly enjoyed was the care with which they restored the hotel. I loved the architecture of the building itself, but the care of the re-design and the details -- really great. Lovely colors. Modern but appropriately retro features, including reproduction doors and inspired lighting features. I found the elevator number panel particularly amusing, though I'm not entirely sure it was intended to sound like a submarine. I had only 2 problems while I was there. One, I had requested a corner room (which allowed for great light, but also increased street noise - be prepared if you are sensitive to this). This gave me lovely partial views of Rainier and the Sound, but also let me overlook a construction site. I asked for a room change to a better view, but they were not able to provide one with similar features. Seeing the placement of the hotel in daylight, I could see why - because it is a historic hotel, it is moderately dwarfed by its neighbors, which means no one has a tremendous view; and the hotel is blocked by other properties. But that's really just fine - I was there for sleeping and working, and you can enjoy all the fantastic views of Seattle by getting out.

The hotel is essentially brand new with a wonderful clubby 1910s city design. Give me an old fashioned and plunk me down in a big comfy couch in the stylish bar or let me unwind in the cozy room. Dark walls and beams, yet spacious and smartly lit. Hardly any shortcuts were taken in the design to make you feel like you're not in 2011...and that's a good thing. On my second stay, they upgraded me to a corner suite on the top floor w/ a balcony. Very nice. Staff was good to great, but not consistently wonderful.

Located close to the city\u2019s center, the Arctic Club is within easy walking distance to many restaurants, museums, and Seattle\u2019s famous Pike Place Market. The elegantly understated interior is designed to evoke the ambiance of early 20th century exploration and is replete with portraits of Arctic explorers, maps of the Northwest Passage, and stately chairs and tables reminiscent of the era. Just past the lobby is the Polar Bar, which perfectly exemplifies the hotel\u2019s desire to provide luxury without taking itself too seriously. The Polar Bar, full of deep, comfortable chairs, cloth napkins and polished silver, has a drunken polar bear as its emblem. Our room, though small, was very well appointed. Many amenities were incorporated into the room, including some that we had never before seen in a hotel room. As well as such common things as a coffee maker, hair dryer and ice bucket, we found tea, a loose tea strainer, and a French press. In addition to the large flat screen television, there was a DVD player and a stereo system complete with CD player. The writing desk was stocked with such office basics as a stapler, scotch tape, scissors, rubber bands and a calculator \u2013 no need to go to the office center. Robes and a safe awaited us in the closet, as well as a large umbrella (this is Seattle, after all). The mini-bar was fully stocked with an array of beverages from champagne to sodas to fruit juices, and there was a basket of snacks that included an impressive array of choices. To their credit, the hotel made it clear that these items were not included in the cost of the room, but did so in an unobtrusive manner (again, their elegant understatement came through). Upon check-in, we were told that we could empty out the mini-bar to make room for anything that we might want to keep refrigerated, a welcome change from the old-style mini-bars that automatically charge you if anything inside is moved. The bathroom was surprisingly roomy, and was designed for comfort and class. The towels were plush and thick, the bathtub jetted. A marble countertop graced the vanity, which had ample storage underneath. The bathroom door was charming, and included a frosted pane in the upper half. This proved to be one of the very few drawbacks, as it allowed light to spill into the main room (only an issue when one of us was in bed before the other). The staff was extremely courteous and knowledgeable about the area. We were given many wonderful recommendations regarding everything from where to dine to modes of transportation to things to see and do. When they discovered that I was on a hunt for one particular item, the front desk staff took it upon themselves to call three different stores that they thought might carry it, and they checked with me upon my return to the hotel that evening to ensure that my quest had been successful. The housekeeping staff, too, was wonderfully warm, courteous and thorough; our room was kept in tip-top shape throughout our stay. Many small details were attended to that really distinguish this hotel as a top-notch place to stay: a hand-written note welcoming us to our room, a variety of teas (not just black, but green and herbal as well), warm cookies upon our arrival.

The staff there couldn't have been more wonderful, especially considering that we called late on what was supposed to be our night of arrival to tell them that we weren't going to make it. When we finally arrived the next day, they had a room ready for us around noon, which was three or four hours earlier than check in time, too. The front desk staff were just wonderful, and so friendly! They always had a smile, great attitude, and helpful advice. They were wonderful when we needed a cab due to a downpour, and even took our photo when we were waiting for the cab, in our wedding attire! The front desk always had apples (and cookies!) at the ready, too. The lobby and the rooms at the hotel were lovely. It was built in the early 1900's, and recently went through a historic renovation. The feel is kind of like a men's club, leather, rich fabric, and soft, comfy furniture. The bar is really nice, and serves food as well. There are comfy chairs and couches in the lobby, along with a fireplace. There was also a couple of computers with internet access, which was nice, as I didn't really want to pay for the wifi, since I was on vacation and tried not to go online!! Our room had a lovely, large bathroom with a beautiful marble topped vanity and a tub that was deep enough for a nice bath. The bed was super comfy, with nice, soft sheets and down bedding. We had no isses regulating the temperature, either. One day, we got back to our room in the early evening and realized that we'd accidentally left the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door handle. When I called the front desk to ask for some fresh towels, they insisted it was no problem to send someone to come up and clean the room, which they did quickly and efficiently. One other great perk is the location. The light rail is literally right across the street, so it only cost a few dollars to go to the airport! We planned to do a lot of walking, and didn't want to rent a car. The hotel was 3 blocks from the water, and probably a ten minute walk from Pike's Place. Pioneer Square is about a five minute walk. The Space Needle, and the nicer shopping area (Nordstroms, Macy's, etc.) is probably a 15-20 minute walk from the hotel. For us, it was a great location! I would say that our stay ranks with stays we've had at Ritz Carlton's and other luxury hotels, with the cost considerably less, which is great! We were thrilled with the service, location, quality and accessibility. I can't recommend it highly enough...great place to stay!", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anaheim Hills, CA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Stay & Staff\u201d", "Author": "RockyRacoon058", "ReviewID": "UR110242784", "Content": "The staff was kind enough to find a room in the hotel in order to permit us to check-in early.

The bed was comfortable with very fluffy soft pillows, which I like, but there were other pillows in the closet and I am sure housekeeping would be happy to bring up firmer pillows.

We also used the Link again to get from the hotel back to the airport. The staff was quick to help us with our bags up and down the stairs outside the lobby, and they were very friendly over the phone before we arrived and also during our stay. We were easily able to walk from here to Pike Street market and the waterfront, and the bus system was very good for getting to spots a little north of downtown since the hotel is inside the \"free ride\" area (e.g., Seattle Center). You definitely don't need to rent a car to get to/from the hotel with your bags, or around town. There is no Hilton Honors lounge, but the breakfast and service in the restaurant downstairs was very good and the vouchers were enough to get a very filling meal each morning. We had a balcony room with a sofa, nice TV, large bathroom w/ whirlpool, and a nice view from the balcony toward the stadium. I especially liked the pull out tray coffee/tea station that we used to make hot tea and French-pressed coffee each morning. The view out of the large windows is somewhat blocked by the surrounding buildings and the building facade, but from our balcony, you could still sneak a view of the Space Needle and see plenty of sky for the sunset, which we thought was really nice.

The room we were given for the pre-cuise night was on the 6th floor and very, very, very small. You really can't turn around in this room.

I don't know what I missed at the Hilton but this hotel is either riding on its past laurels or other reviewers have been smoking something. First off, the service was INDIFFERENT. We called in the morning of our arrival requesting an early check-in and the answer was \"well, you know we don't guarantee this sort of thing, just show up and see\". We got there around 1pm and there was no one at the door except for wedding photographer taking shots of the groom on the elegant but steep 19th century marble steps at the Cherry Street entrance. No one to help with the luggage nor any signs to suggest the friendlier alternative ground level entrance around the corner on 3rd Avenue. At check-in we did get the customary Doubletree cookies were promptly asked to wait pending a phone call. We chose to camp out in the totally deserted lobby. At least it was dark and cool (on a rare warm sunny Seattle day). At about 3:10 (so much for early check-in, even the \"official\" check in time was 3:00pm) having received no phone call, I stepped up to the desk and was checked in without fuss. Ok, not a big deal but certainly not the service level I expected after the ratings on this site. The hotel room itself was ridiculously small, I'm guess it is no more than 10'x10'. One half of the dresser stayed locked (I suspected it was a minibar and I didn't want to bother running a perpetual argument with our 9 year old, so I didn't bother to ask). The other half had drawers which could not be opened if you had the drop top down for the coffee center on top. I don't think I've stayed in a smaller room in Manhattan. Our room in particular had two large double-hung windows, except unfortunately, the room was located facing a notch in the building footprint so the view was that of a blank wall. The bed linens were outstanding, especially the down pillows. The modern double-paned windows, excellent climate control, and an interior location on a high floor on a weekend downtown meant that sleep quality was outstanding. The bathroom on the other hand was very spacious, tastefully decorated, and was better situated so we had (partial) views of the Seattle public library which is two blocks north. The mosaic tile floor and the marble vanity were nice touches. I understand the need to conserve water and most hotels in this class have adjustable heads that trade off water flow and pressure. However, this shower was one of those \"rain bath\" affairs - about a 8\" wide head with acceptable water volume but not enough pressure and no adjustments. In terms of location it IS very convenient to the transit tunnel but compared to other downtown Seattle hotels, that is about the ONLY advantage. This part of downtown has nothing next to it other than the City Hall and the County Courthouse and a huge empty block - presumably something interesting will eventually fill that space. But most of the shopping and touristy attractions are up further north towards the Westlake center area, or south towards Pioneer Square (which is not far). We did not use the fitness center but there is no swimming pool, which is not uncommon for older hotels of this vintage. On Sunday night there was nothing open close by for dinner so we had to take the bus uptown (which is NOT free after 7pm). On Monday we found a decent Thai place on Second Avenue - great prices after all $25-$30 per person places over the weekend. I would also recommend the Vietnamese sandwich shop whose name escapes me now but is near 2nd and James, NOT the one on Cherry & 3rd which is twice as expensive. Pick up a couple of banh mi (Vietnamese sandwiches) - we had the grilled pork and the chicken and they were both very good and a steal at $2.75. They did give us a late check out (till 2pm) without fuss and stored our bags till we took the train to the airport in the evening.

We were given a room out the back to try and get a room that wasnt noisy - the room looked over a back parking lot and the airconditioning unit so it was nearly as noisy as being at the front.

We could have stayed at the Hilton and received a better rate but, after reading the reviews and looking at the photos, I really wanted to stay here. We got to the hotel earlier than check-in time (our flight arrived at noon, so it couldn't be helped) and were told that no rooms were available because check-out was 1pm (not true). We decided to leave and go for lunch, so the gentleman checking us in took our number and said he'd call when our room was ready (he did not). He did, however, stop to answer the phone while we were in the middle of talking with him. When we returned our room had apparently just become available. As a gold member, upgrades are given based on availability, but when my husband asked about this he was told the hotel was full and there were no upgrade available (we later found out that this was also not true). We were assigned a very nice room, but it was located right by the elevators on the 3rd floor and overlooked a stretch of 3rd Ave which was undergoing some type of construction. We were too tired to go back down to the front desk to ask to switch, and also did not realise till later that we had not been offered any of the gold perks (free breakfast, wifi, or points), and we didn't even get a cookie!!! The horror!! When we later inquired breakfast, Jackie at the front desk was very apologetic and actually mentioned that our reservation indicated that this option had not been offered to us. Overall, the Arctic Club is very nice. The decor is much more inviting than that of a traditional hotel and it is conveniently located beside the Pioneer Square light rail station.

However, over the past three months both the restuarant (Juno) and the housekeeping have deteriorated. The restaurant service and food quality, especially room service, is now haphazard at best. Housekeeping has missed my room completely once in July and twice (so far) in August. I have had two occasions when the typical amenities (soap, shampoo etc) have not been in the room when I checked in and two more where they were not restocked after use. This is probably not a problem if you are staying for a couple of days but when you are trying to get ready in the morning and discover you have no soap, washclothes, towels or bathmats it is more than a little troubling. There is also an increasing amount of deferred maintainence at the property, mostly stained carpets, balky card readers in the elevators and things like that. When I have stayed at the hotel before this month I was able to enjoy HBO but that channel is now gone and several others are also gone.

When we did arrive everyone was friendly and we got a very warm and personable welcome by the front desk, concierge and car parker. We were shown quickly to our large room which was upgraded for Diamond status. The hotel oozes history of that Northwest and Alaska variety. Yes, it's a bit dark, lobby and room, with varnished wood and sepia photographs of the original Arctic Club members. I call it atmosphere. We loved the walrus icons everywhere and only wish there was a line of logo'd items for purchase in the lobby. That walrus and Arctic logo would look good on a t-shirt or polo. The bathroom is great and has that last century feeling to it except for the jetted tub. Comp breakfast the next morning was great, service speedy and friendly. A stay here is pricey though. Our room with one night and parking came to nearly $300 once the local taxes are added on. That's a bit dear for us so I wouldn't make a long stay here unless I was on the company's dollar.

It is very easy to find if you have taken a bus to Pioneer Sq, it's one block away and less than a minute to get to the hotel. If you are travelling from the airport, the 194 bus will take you downtown directly and the fare is $2, you must also have the exact amount. When I arrived at the hotel before 2pm, my room was not ready, this was not a problem for me, as a first time visitor, it gave me the opportunity to drop my bags off and explore the downtown area quite easily. The check-in staff were very pleasant and offered me a nice warm cookie before I set off on my way and offered to call me to notify me that my room was ready and I was able to check in. The concierge team were also very helpful in ensuring that I had a good time in Seattle by offering me a map and suggestions for things to do in the city in such a short space of time. I had to leave the city early in the morning and the hotel promptly gave me a wake-up call and offered me a car to drive me to the airport at 5am, this was at a cost of $40. The room I was allocated was of an adequate size bearing in mind that I was a solo traveller, if travelling with another person, I would imagine that the room would feel smaller than most hotels. The bathroom had an old world charm about it with wallpaper on the walls and a classic cosy feel. I was on a higher floor, however, it was still possible to hear the street noise which was a little off putting at times but it didn't spoil my stay. I did not use the lobby lounge but it had a warm 'gentleman's club' type feel with classic furniture, soft lighting, which for me, made the hotel feel intimate unlike other hotels I have stayed in. If you feel like a good walk (10-15 minutes) then head to the Farmers Market then take the monorail nearby to the Space Needle, which boasts some spectacular views of the city.

We then took the ferry to Victoria, BC for a 3 day visit, and returned to the Arctic Club for one more night, this time in a Queen nonsmoking, shower only.

The hotel has been beautifully restored by Hilton/Doubletree. Entering the lobby is like stepping back in time to when the hotel was the Arctic Men's Club.

Play a game of billiards if you like, too. The staff at the hotel is top-notch. Check-in was smooth. The front desk staff were very friendly and efficient. In fact, all staff members we encountered were friendly, professional, able to provide directions to area attractions and gave some great restaurant recommendations (as in Ivar's on the waterfront, or Wild Ginger for Thai food at 3rd and Union; both outstanding restaurants.) Our room was extremely comfortable. We were on the third floor. Huge room in comparison to most standard hotel rooms. Nice entry foyer, with desk, living room, tall ceilings, three windows (that actually open!) Comfortable chairs. Huge bathroom, with jacuzzi tub. Great view of Mt. Ranier from the bathroom. In-room coffee is Starbucks (of course -- this is Seattle!) made with your very own French press. There was a flat-panel TV too (but we never turned it on -- too much to see and do in Seattle, plus we were there for the Rodrigo y Gabriela concert at the Moore Theater.) The hotel is a very short walk to historic Pioneer Square, a short ten-minute walk to the waterfront or Pike Place Market. The Space Needle was easily reached by using the bus/light rail transit tube then transferring to the monorail. The transit tube station is across the street from the hotel. We did eat breakfast one morning in Juno. Our server did seem a bit frazzled but was friendly. The food was great! Lastly, the staff in the Polar Bar was outstanding; really made us feel welcome and made some excellent restaurant suggestions. Plus, there's a happy hour from 3 pm to 6 pm, with a special drink of the day and discounted prices on other cocktails. Would I stay here again? You bet!

A very refreshing change from what is considered trendy these days. Again i could hardly believe i was staying in a Doubletree--the room was much nicer and larger than some Ritz-Carlton rooms i have stayed in (i was in a Premire King room). I do agree with a previous reviewer that the rooms are on the dark side. For me this just enhanced the mood of the hotel. Also, the front desk staff was very pleasant and efficient and the concierge offered great local, insider suggestions-not the usual tourist fare. A couple of small complaints--there was no bellman at the front door when i arrived, meaning i had to carry my luggage up a flight of stairs and through thte front doors myself. Also, my wake up call never came, which had i not set the alarm clock as a back up might have become a huge complaint. Finally--the location is great--just on the edge of Pioneer Square and in the middle of the business district with City Hall across the street. A huge bonus is the light rail and bus tunnel entrance right across the street--meaning that when the light rail link to the airport is complete in December you can ride it to the front door of the hotel for just $2.50, saving you at least $40 in cab fare.

The hotel itself is classic men's club that has been converted into a stylish hotel while maintaining (or, more likely, recreating) the ambience of such a club. A lot of effort went into the decorating and it was worth it. The furniture in my room had a vaguely art deco feel to it. The bed was extra comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and very attractive (they had, once again, gone to considerable effort to make it both very modern but esthetically keyed to the period of the club itself). I didn't try the restaurants or the bar, but the latter looked quite inviting. Some huge party was going on when I checked in but my room itself was quiet. One oddity which I am sure was just a bit of bad luck: when I arrived at my room after checking in, the door was propped open. I used my key to confirm that I wasn't going to the wrong room (I wasn't) and then I checked the room and everything was in order. I then locked and bolted the door. Still, it was a bit unsettling. While common, I note that they charged for Internet access, something I consider gratuitous and annoying (especially since more basic hotels almost always offer it for free these days).
