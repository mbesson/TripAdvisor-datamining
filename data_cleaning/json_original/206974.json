I have read previous reviews and decided to try. I have to admit, that this was one of the most pleasant hotel experiences I've ever had. I would love to have other hotels to be as good as this property! From the airport you could get there using metro with one change only - just follow clear instructions on the hotel's website. Check-in was quick, efficient and totally hassle-free. All reception staff was professional and natural at the same time. I loved that approach. All questions answered with any unnecessary questions or procedures. Lobby is very modern, bright and decorated with light-colours. I've got room #704. I didn't expect much, but I was delighted with the room. Trendy, modern, up-to-date decor. Spotless clean and fresh and I think selection of colours and materials chosen are great. Air-condition was quiet and easy to use. Flat screen TV, free safety deposit box, phone, fridge, large wardrobe are only few amenities there. What is worth pointing, that prices of the mini-bar are very reasonable and fair - you can easily use that and your pocket will not be emptied as in other hotels for the same stuff. There is a Wi-Fi Internet access and price is 10,80 EUR for 24h - acceptable. Connection is fast and non-problematic log-in. Bathroom was another masterpiece of hotel design. Glass-walled shower, large mirror, hair-dryer, selection of good quality toiletries and fluffy towels is provided. Actually, I'd love to buy some of these cosmetics in the future. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t have chance to try their breakfast, but room looked really inviting early in the morning. Overall my experience of the NH Principe de Vergara Hotel was very good.

The hotel is very close to a metro station (Avenida de America), 2-3 minutes walk from the exit (just follow the Principe de Vergara exit signs; the hotel is on the same side as a petrol station, just go down the street). The check-in & check-out process went quickly, staff was very friendly, nice and professional. I found my room clean and spacious. Although it was next to the elevator, I couldn't hear anything from the outside (other guest waiting for the lift etc.) and the room seemed well sound-isolated. In the bathroom you can turn on speakers and listen to a programme that you have running on TV in the room (it was very relaxing taking a shower and listening to music :) ). There are enough different TV programmes available (many different languages). There was just enough of choice of food for breakfast in my opinion. I am not very picky and can always find something to eat, but I only sort of missed more vegetables (like tomato, cucumbers, olives ...). On request they can also prepare for you eggs, bacon ... Someone could, however, miss broader choice of different food, but in my opinion everyone can find something for him/her and not to leave breakfast hungry. The food was fresh and delicious. If I remember correctly, you can use 15 minutes of free wi-fi internet (you ask in the reception for a password). In the lobby there's a computer and again, if I am not wrong, a minute of use costs 0,37 eur. I didn't need to use it so I can't judge about the price of this service.

The hotel is located in a good area of the city and the rooms were modern, well equipped and following advice from earlier comments, quiet, after requesting room to the rear.

Getting around, we pretty much walked most of the time. It takes prob 20 mins or so to main park, Retiro, and is a must to have a look around. We hired out bikes which made it a bit easier because the park is huge. We also got the city bus tour - well worth it and saved us walking all the time. There are 2 routes available, the cost of which covers both. One day charge is 20 euros, 24 euros for 2 days use. You can buy a ticket on the bus or at the various kiosks. One of the routes does come up closer to the hotel which is handy. Public bus route also available and relatively cheap right outside hotel. As for eating out, I would thoroughly recommend Cazorla. Turn left outside front of the hotel, walk approx 2 blocks until you see a '7' sign for a convenience store and take a right at that junction. One block along you will see the restaurant at corner where you can either stand at the bar or have a sit down meal. Not too expensive and the food is good quality tapas and main dishes.

I arrived early in the morning (9 am) on Christmas day after a long overnight flight and the first remark I have to make is that if you have a heavy suitcase and cannot lift it yourself,you may have a problem because there are no bellhops and no ramp to wheel suitcases up,so you have to tackle about 20 stairs to go into the hotel. I was greeted by a very nice red-headed young man who was the receptionist (just pointing this out because he was the nicest and most helpful receptionist of all the ones I encountered during my stay) and who made no fuss about me checking in that early (a welcome change from the inflexible US hotels where one has to languish in a jet-lagged daze in the lobby for hours until the \"official\" check-in time which can be as late as 3 pm in some cases) and also kindly gave me a king-sized bed (room 307),which I was happy about.It was on a smoking floor (due to the early hour, there were no other quiet,king-size bedrooms available and the receptionist told me that if by chance it smelled of smoke too much, he'd find me another option) but thankfully, the room did not smell of smoke (only the corridor on that floor).It was a small room but nicely decorated (modern style),good thick windows,your own heating/cooling control, an area to sit at a table, a minibar, comfortable bed (though some may find it a little hard,but for me it was fine) and very quiet. The flat screen TV on the wall had a multitude of channels and with the remote you could see the movies on the Spanish channels in their original versions instead of dubbed,which was a nice touch.Unfortunately,the satellite did not seem to be working well for some of the channels but I was pretty tired and did not watch much TV anyway. The bathroom had a shower (I would have preferred a tub) .The water pressure was good and it was a rain shower with the option of switching the water-flow to a handheld shower,which I appreciated very much since I don't like getting my hair wet.Unfortunately, the door to the shower is not very effective and the whole bathroom was pretty much flooded by the time I got out of the shower every time I used it,so it's something to be careful with so one does not slip on the way out. After a couple of nights, I stayed at a friends place and then I came back for another couple of nights. On my second stay ,I was given the same type of room but on the 6th floor (607), a non-smoking floor. This was around the New year and the hotel had booked a very noisy couple in the room next to mine who was part of a larger group that had rooms also on that floor. I could hear every single word that was spoken by this couple (and they spoke very loudly,laughing,playing music,whistling...all audible as if they were in my room).The whole group also shouted in the corridors and banged doors continually which was very disagreeable.I called reception and they said they would talk to them but I am not sure they did because the noise continued.Regardless,I managed to sleep very well (I sleep with earplugs) but when you are watching TV (the channels worked very well in this room) or just trying to work in your room it does become very bothersome to hear every single thing that goes on in the room next door.The room had a connecting door so perhaps other rooms that don't have connecting doors are quieter. On one occasion I did not feel like going out to eat and visited the hotel's \"restaurant\",which really has a very limited offering.I ordered a cream of asparagus which was very acid,to the point I wondered if it had turned bad or something ( it hadn't because I was ok after eating it and did not get sick,so it was just that the soup was awful tasting) and also it was very expensive:8 Euros and 50 cents so I would really recommend eating at one of the many restaurants/bars in the area and not in the hotel.A tip about the internet: they have free wi-fi in the lobby but they charge you 10 Euros if you want to use it in your room (for 24 hours).But if you are in your room and connect to the internet from there, you can get the same 24 hours for \"only\" 8 Euros and 85 cents by paying with your credit card on the screen that pops up. So don't buy from the hotel,buy it in your room if you have to.I cannot comment on the breakfast because I was so jet-lagged I never managed to get up in time to have it,but I was impressed that they offered it until 11 am which is great if you like to sleep in.The hotel's location is good, close to the exit to the airport so you don't have to deal with the traffic that more centrally located hotels have and close to the metro which takes you everywhere very quickly and inexpensively.There are plenty of restaurants around and the neighborhood is very safe. All in all, and specially for the great rate I got of 64 Euros including breakfast (the first two nights,the second nights it was without breakfast but still a good rate) and a late check-out time included (until 5 pm!), I would definitely stay there again.The only thing I would do different is ask for a room without connecting doors to the room next door because of the noise issue and I would ask for a room with a tub.But I really liked this hotel and would stay there again.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki", "Title": "\u201cPleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "FreeMind", "ReviewID": "UR122290769", "Content": "Chose the Principe de Vergara due to its location between Barajas Airport and downtown.

It's a good hotel in a fairly quiet part of Madrid. I thought I would, however, just add some practical information for getting to and from the city which is about two miles or so away as the transport links are really good. The number 52 bus runs every few minutes during the day and fairly frequently at night and weekends.It takes about ten minutes to reach the terminus at Puerta del Sol. The stop is a five minutes walk to the right as you leave the hotel on Principe de Vergara. The last bus back from Sol is around 11.30 pm but there are night buses (N2 and N4) which leave from Plaza de la Cibeles (by the elegant main Post Office) . Amazingly these even ran, every 30 minutes, in the early hours of New Years morning, much to our relief as we had resigned ourselves to walk back after the New Year celebrations in Sol. The metro stop,Avenda de America, is just beyond the bus stop about 150 yeards from the hotel. A ten trip ticket, which can be used on either bus or metro is exceptional value at euro 6-15. Hope this review helps, we have stayed in the centre of Madrid before. Whilst it's handy to be able to walk to most places we enjoyed the relative quiet of being just outstide the city. Salamanca is a nice part of Madrid and there are good restaurants and bars to wind down in close by after a days sightseeing.
