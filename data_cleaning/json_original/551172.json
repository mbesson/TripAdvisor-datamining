We were shown to our room (at the very top of the hotel!) which was not ready so we had to wait outside it.

On entry to the room we noticed that there was no handle or lock on the bathroom door, no was there any plug in the sink. The drawers were utter crap, nobs fell off, drawers stuck. Bed was the only thing that was nice - although the covers were blankets! Our shower leaked all over the floor and we had to use the two 'very small towels that we were given' to mop it up. There was no hand towel either! Mentioned to the manager that we needed new towels only to be told that 'there are only two provided (they were hand towels rather than bath towels!!!!) and when I explained that we needed two new ones - I was told 'whatever!' - totally unacceptable. That night the room was so hot we had to sleep with the windows OPEN - with not many blankets to keep us warm we eneded up sleeping with our coats on as we couldnt work out how to switch the heating off in our room! Breakfast in the morning was ANOTHER DISASTER! Jars of Jam, bowls of crap margerine and a container of orange juice were on the table greated us! Beans were COLD, scrambled egg was COLD and the fried eggs were LOOK-WARM. The heating plate for the food was broken. Cold plates too! Staff were attentive, but when I asked for hot beans I got look warm ones! Totally not acceptable. How do you know that bacteria has been erradicated if you are served COLD FOOD! We spent time out as much as possible! Bedsheets were clean so no sign of bed bugs - but I bet there were some! I really would recommend you NOT stay at this hotel with children as its really not up to scratch.

Room was cold and only one towel supplied, no toilet roll only one cup etc on arrival. These items were sorted out by visiting the reception in the block next door.

Again towels etc were only provided for two people and a visit had to be made to reception next door. The banister rail had been pulled off and was at the bottom of the stairs, stair carpet was very lose fitting and dangerous. You could just about get into the ensuite and shut the door which wouldn't lock. No plug for the washbasin and the shower head wall fitting was missing. Breakfast was a laugh!! Carton of Tesco orange juice and a roll of kitchen paper towel on each table when you could find an empty one. Toast was deposited into a bread bin for self service along with warm scrambled egg, fried eggs and cold baked beans all left uncovered on a warming tray.

Positives: Bedroom clean and spacious enough; kind of narrow though also quite long. The bathroom was surprisingly modern and very clean. Free wifi was good; it dropped out a few times but not enough to be annoying and was fast enough when it worked. The staff were personable enough, and the hotel had a reasonably pleasant ambiance, especially the breakfast room. Negatives: You don't expect everything to work in a place like this and it didn't. The TV reception was very poor on most stations and I seem to recall Pay TV being advertised for free too though saw no evidence of this. And scrambled/poached eggs was the full extent of your 'cooked breakfast' (i.e., no bacon or sausages, meaning you have to load up on cold baked beans if you dare). Summary: I would stay here again if I could get the room for the same price, which I guess constitutes an overall thumbs up.", "Date": "June 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "delhi", "Title": "\u201cgenerally happy\u201d", "Author": "indochi", "ReviewID": "UR24223130", "Content": "we came to the asian exhibiton at the olympia and needed something close, so booked this place, was generally happy with the place, was close and clean, and good for the price i paid, will recommend anyone,wifi toom some time to work though....", "Date": "February 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cStay with care\u201d", "Author": "Greenhoppers", "ReviewID": "UR20778999", "Content": "The Euro Hotel is cheap, cheerful and clean if all you want is a bed for the night although on arrival you could be despatched to 3 or 4 different hotels nearby.

Book it through an agency NOT directly with the hotel (So you pay the agency). The hotel took my credit card details to confirm a booking. I told them on arrival I would pay cash and did not expect a claim against my credit card. I paid cash. When my credit card bill came ... guess what? ... I'm still trying to sort out this weeks later and no one at the hotel will speak to me or ring me back when I leave a message. My best advice?

THe check in was pretty simple and quick and we got a room in mins, was kind of small but wasnt expecting 2 big a room in London. Room was spotless and had shower and toilet in it, plus had all the very basic facilities like tea and coffee and few sky channels, Overall i was Very Happy with the price that i paid for this hotel and had a brilliant experience, wont mind havin a different breakfast menu everyday, But very pleased.", "Date": "September 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Valbear", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for money\u201d", "Author": "Valbear", "ReviewID": "UR18876602", "Content": "After reading the reviews on this site we weren't really sure what to expect, but I have to say we were all pleasently surprised.

The staff were friendly and check in was seamless with no fuss about the dogs either. Some of the rooms were small, but they were clean and tidy which is what really counts. I didn't find the single glazing or bedding an issue. The hotel is in a really good location with a great pub just down the road and lots of places to eat.

We looked around on the internet for a suitable hotel, as my dad used to live in London he said Earl's Court was a good place to stay, good night life, so we booked the Cromwell Crown Hotel \u00c2\u00a3110 for 2 nights, GREAT we thought! Booked this around May time, end of November get a phone call to say we have been moved to the Royal Guest House, wern't too fussed as long as we had a room!! Phoned the Royal Guest house at the start of the week, they had never heard of us GREAT!! well we sorted this out so was all fine!! Arrived at the hotel about 5 ish LOTS and LOTS of confusion!! Eventually sorted it all out and paid, were told by Cromwell Crown this hotel had agreed to do us a discounted price for the inconvinience, never happened!! but just wanted a large drink so just got o with it!!! anway after paying were told we would be in 2 different buildings, just grin and bear it, 2 couples were going to a newly refurbished hotel, and me and my partner and another couple to one yet to be done!! but we were told if we met at 9.30am at the original hotel we could move to the better hotel for the 2nd night!! So we got to our room and I could have cried!! *Single glazed windows no quilt just 2 sheets!!! *we had paid 55 for a double en suite we had a shower but it looked more like a tardis in the corner, scummy dirty and no proper ventilation, top had been turned at an angle to let air out!! * sink had been patched up with something that looked like chewing gum!! * NO TOILET.... EN SUITE?!?!?! *2 tv remoted neither worked!! * NO tea cofee or kettle * GENERLLY DISGUSTING!! met at 9.30 am only to be told no rooms till 11!!! GRRRRRR eventually after a nice day out returned at 5 to have nice rooms in Euro hotel, clean andcomfy not massive but vast improvment!!! so no toilet roll but we coped!! everything was ok nice sleep till 7am when we were awoken by someone hovering the hallway and banging the hoover on our door!! GREAT!! tried to go back to sleep ten mins later BANG BANG great we couldnt have been closer to the heavy handed staff in the kitchen then 15 mins later they were moving the room around next door and trying to fix a broken door!! eventually at 8.40 i couldnt cope anymore, got up for a shower !!

We were logging here for a couple days before we had to be moved to their other hotel chain (Royal Guest House 2), because of lack of space. I believe breakfast is included in the price. The breakfast consist of cereal, 2 toasts, choice of eggs (scrambled, or sunny side), side of beans, instant coffee, orange juice and/or tea. The hotel itself is located 3 - 5 minute walk from Shepherd's Bush Station. Surrounding the hotel there are little shops and restaurants. However I would suggest to get the 'Oyster card' for zone 1-2 for the underground transit*. Hotel Room is cosy, aka just enough space for your luggage (floor space) and the bed. The washroom are clean, but not pristine. I thought it felt more like a very good quality backpackers hostel then a hotel. In a hotel they don't relocate your room for any reason, as for a hostel if the room you are staying is needed then re-location takes place. The host at the Eurohotel is very nice and understanding, we definitely missed his jokes and kindness. We have also stayed at the Royal Guest House 2, please check it out, just in case you get relocated there. *A little note for first time buyers it cost 24pounds for a week pass, including the charge of the card. However, if you are just staying for a few days it is ideal just to buy the 'Oyster Card' on its own and put money in it. The card cost 3pounds and within Zone 1 & 2 the maximum cost of travel is 4.40pounds, where one trip can cost up to 1.80pounds. So even you use the card multiple times during the day it will only cost at most 4.40pounds.", "Date": "November 21, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Euro Hotel Hammersmith", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d551172-Reviews-Euro_Hotel_Hammersmith-London_England.html", "Price": "$71 - $199*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">31 Shepherds Bush Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">W6 7LX</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "551172", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b5/8e/b58ef1b2817de214d1e3ff031843b50b5large.jpg"}}
