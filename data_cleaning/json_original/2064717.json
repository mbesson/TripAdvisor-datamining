But then again your not in europe to watch tv! Spend time out of your room. There's even a self wash saloon a few blocks away. Across the street from there is a wonderful fruit stand. The owner makes fresh hummus and has a great selection of Mediterranean sides. We were so happy to pick up some fresh fruit, olives, hummus, amazing holland Gouda cheese, fresh bread and a bottle of wine!

The room was simply, but beautifuly furnished. The bath room was great and the shower was amazing. I felt that the price was very good for the room. There are a few things that were not perfect. You have to use your key to use the lifts (by placing it on a black disc next to the lift doors) Even if the lift was on the ground floor the doors wouldnt open, So you are left by the lift repeatedly touching your key to the disc, not knowing if it was working. There was no mini bar, only a small vending machine. I usually don't purchace things from the mini bar because it is too expensive, but it is nice to have a fridge to store your own water. The bathroom light comes on automatically when you enter . Since the bathroom door is glass, I was woken up at night when my husband went to the toilet. When I was having a shower the light went off (after about 4 to 5 mins), and didn't come back on again until I got out. Not a huge problem, but something to be aware of :) All is all we had a lovely stay at Notting Hill, we would stay here again.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMany issues, would have loved to be back but most unhelpful in returning my deposit\u201d", "Author": "tvanheusden1", "ReviewID": "UR115611931", "Content": "Stay there on the 12th July for one night - paid the hotel cash in full but had to give my debit card to hold a secure deposit for additionals - I have since found out that the hotel is still holding this deposit against my card and it is over 8 days now.

With the Hotel Notting Hill it seems that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about the look and not about the function. The building looks good as does the interior as one enters reception and the common areas looks fine with a decent choice of colours. There is only one elevator and it is rather slow and the floor numbers shown do not correspond to the floors one is wanting. We were on the 3rd floor and the number on the panel in the lift showed floor 4, but that was not a major problem just odd. Then one gets to the room itself and this is where our dislike and the feeling that look is more important than the function comes into play. We had booked a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Twin Deluxe Room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and if this was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deluxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I am so glad we had not chosen a standard room. Our room was number 314 and I think was on the top floor of the building with a small window overlooking the street. The window could not be opened therefor one had to reply upon the air conditioning for any air in the room. Even though the window would not open, was double glazed and on the 3rd floor (well we think it was but with the lift numbering being off I cannot be certain) it is quite noisy with the trams running on the street in front of the building, but this is quite a common problem with Amsterdam. The room was long and very very narrow with barely room to swing the proverbial cat!! There are many things one could say about the room itself but it was it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s size which triggered the dislike. There was a wardrobe (taking up half of the room width) with shelving on one side and hanging space on the other. Well, with 2 bathrobes taking up most of the hanging space and an ironing board and iron taking up most of the rest there really was no room to hang ones clothes. What really got to us was the bathroom, and this is really a case of the designer just not thinking about how many of the fittings could (or rather could not) be used without aggravation. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s start with the floor to ceiling glass door. Now, no matter how long one has been with one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partner it is very embarrassing not to be able to use the toilet whilst sitting and doing what nature requires (and which rhymes with sitting). Then one needs to use the hand basin, well I have not used a hand basin before where you have to screw or unscrew the piece of the sink that allows the water to drain or prevent it doing so, how stupid is that!!!! There is nowhere to put the bar of soap provided and the mirror unit over the sink is so badly positioned that you continually bang your head on the shelf surrounding the mirror. When taking a shower there is only a very small (totally inadequate) tray on which to put shower gels / shampoo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s soaps etc etc. Now whether one uses the large overhead shower head rose or the hand held option water floods under the door of the shower into the bathroom and into the room itself, requiring one to stack towels on the floor to avoid slipping and doing physical damage!!! The only plus factors for us were (a) good free in room Wi-Fi internet and (b) the Nespresso coffee machine. We really would not recommend this Hotel to visitors to Amsterdam, there must be better for the price and whilst it may not look as good it will function better.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster", "Title": "\u201cClean and Convenient\u201d", "Author": "PenguinPower", "ReviewID": "UR115218585", "Content": "Judging by the size of the hotel bar (small) and the fact that the bathroom door is transparent this hotel seems to be aiming more for the lone business traveller and couples rather than families/friends on holiday. When we first checked in at about 1700 we were taken to a room in the basement. To the hotel staff member's embarrassment the room was clearly occupied (bag and clothes on chair, bed unmade). She ushered us back to the reception and she confirmed that according to the computer the room was vacant and clean. The only other room available was on the second floor - and we were relieved. The basement room looked dark and gloomy and smelled of stale cigarette smoke. The second floor room was bright, clean, comfortable, free WiFi- everything you could ask for! The service at the front desk is efficient and business like. The bar and 'behind the scene' staff were more friendly and more chatty. The minibar is a vending machine rather than a fridge - with a Mars chocolate bar setting you back \u00c2\u00a32.50!! No water is provided either but you do get a Nespresso machine with a choice of three coffee pods. English tea drinkers may wish to bring their own tea bags. The closest my husband got to a 'real cuppa' was Earl Grey and that was only on day 1. Day 2 -5 was nothing but fruit tea and green tea. We didn't eat at the hotel, so can't comment on the food. Location wise, it couldn't be better. Tram 4 and 25 stop outside the hotel and go all the way to Centraal Station (10-15 mins max), the metro station is a short walk away. The hotel is very close to the Albert Cyupmarkt.

Overall, this was a beautiful, stylish place to stay, but it lacked an obvious polish of a hotel that had been around for awhile. The front desk staff was quite young, at times a little disheveled, unsure of protocol and lacking in neighborhood/popular restaurants/parking option knowledge, but were overall pleasant and helpful. This hotel is located away from any major restaurant or bars, which makes for a quieter part of town, but it's still close enough to walk to almost everything. I'll give them a pass on most things they were still working on (i.e. getting mini fridges for the room, fixing the elevators to go to the right floor, buckets of dirty tools laying around), but there were a couple of things that did get to me. One was the wastefulness of the maid staff. They tossed out the open soaps and replaced the towels every day (they also tossed out our personal soap that we had brought). When we realized they did this, we left the 'do not disturb' button on (everything's very modern and electronic) because we didn't need all new everything, but they came in anyway. Minor, but it would be nice to give guests the option to not be so wasteful and to decide when they didn't want someone in their room. The major thing that bothered me is probably more of an American thing, as it has to do with modesty and privacy. The door to the bathroom is completely transparent glass. I've seen a lot of this travelling throughout Europe in the last year, but this is the first time that anyone on the bed had a direct view of the toilet (how romantic) and a door that didn't even close. The door had a handle and latch that looked like it would go into a door frame - but there was no frame there. There was just a three inch gap all the way around and the door just hung a little open. I'm assuming based on the door design that this is something they're still working on, but it was quite off-putting. The room we had faced the street, but was still a nice enough view with the trees and the canal off to the right. The tram stops right in front of the hotel, which is convenient, but sounds like a low roll of thunder every 20 minutes or so. Not overly loud, just surprising at times. The room was a good size, by European standards, and being new, was spectacularly clean. The bed was quite comfortable but I was surprised how awful and lumpy the pillows were. I thought that was something that resulted from wear, but apparently that's how they're purchased. With some more polish in the service, crossing off the outstanding 'to-dos' and doing something about the bathroom doors, this has the potential to be a really great, 4-5 star place to stay. I hope to hear from reviewers about improvements so we might stay here again on our next trip to Amsterdam.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Notting Hill", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d2064717-Reviews-Hotel_Notting_Hill-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$170 - $487*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Westeinde 26</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1017 ZP</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2064717", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/4b/42/0e/hotel-notting-hill.jpg"}}
