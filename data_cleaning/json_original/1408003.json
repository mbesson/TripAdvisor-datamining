Overall my experience was very good. The 3 star hotel, while nothing spectacular, is centrally situated minutes walk from some of the main sites in the Sultanahmet 'Old Town' area of Istanbul. The hotel, opened 2.5 years and is in good shape and very clean. Ramazan and Sebo at the Front Desk were extremely helpful in providing guidance and information on places to go and eat. They will contact local guide/tour services on your behalf. They are also very eager to hear of any good and bad points about the hotel or their services. My experience illustrated this as when I arrived my single room was not available and I was given a double at the same price for one night. My bags were moved to the new room the next days so when I got back everything was set. I was also supposed to check out for my last night to their sister hotel (The Peninsula) due to room availability but when I returned to checkout Ramazan had worked out a deal with the other hotel so I could remain there for my last night, even putting me up in a double room at same price. Breakfast is OK: bread, juice, fruit, feta, olives, tomatoes, cucumber, hard boiled eggs. If you want a full English or American breakfast this ain't your place. But it was perfect for me. Breakfast is taken on the top floor with views of the Marmara See and Asian-side of Istanbul. The two level terrace is also perfect for sitting at night and just watching the sea traffic and hearing the call to prayers from the nearby Blue Mosque. I always advise bringing earplugs and in this case, although on a side street, you do get traffic noise in the morning and also the obligatory call to prayer at 5:30. :) Thanks Ramazan and Sebo for you hospitality and customer service!", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sicily, Italy", "Title": "\u201cGrande!!!\u201d", "Author": "AintTalkin", "ReviewID": "UR127486417", "Content": "This boutique hotel delivered on all levels for me.

I booked this hotel mainly for its value and location. Value: Great value given the location. Couldn't be better. Location: The highlights of Istanbul, the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia, are within 5 minute walking distance. Having said that, the metro trains are very convenient and come often so any hotel near a train station would provide ease of access to places. This is in a very touristy area so you won't get an authentic experience if that's what you're looking for. Room: Small and clean. Service: Very friendly and helpful. Breakfast: Good Other comments Restaurant: I would stay away from the restaurant recommendations. I went to a nearby place they recommended. I believe it is called Magnolia. In addition to Turkish food, they had pasta and other Western food (typically a bad sign). The food was okay but definitely not worth the money. Turkish Bath (Hammam): Strongly recommended. The hotel recommended a bath place that had pick-up service. I chose another place called Cagaloglu Hammam (I visited this place on my last visit as well) that is pricier but also supposedly the best bath place in town. Regardless of where you go, Turkish bath is an experience not to be missed. If you do go to Cagaloglu, I wouldn't recommend the massage service. The service was good but the person tried my patience when he reminded me for the fifth time to pay him tip on the way out. Bazaars: These are closed on Sundays. Mosques: Know when the prayer time is and plan to visit well ahead of the time since they don't allow tourists in during (and also several minutes before) the prayer. The popular places generally have less tourists during lunch hours. Nargile: Known more commonly as Hookah in the States. Try visiting a Nargile place that the locals go to.

All my enquireis were answered promptly and I booked a large double room with balcony and sea view - only slightly more expensive than a standard room. We enjoyed a lovely stay here with all the hospitality of Ramazan and his team of friendly staff and agree with everything already stated by previous reviewers: location cannot be better than this, everything is close - \"restaurant street\" vitually back to back with the hotel, close walking distance to everything, tram nearby to go to the further places like ferries and Taksim. But even so, I was still amazed to see how small the area (Sultanahmet) actually is, what looked to me like huge distances on a google map, all was within easy walking distance, even to the ferries was a comfortable 20 minutes walk but easier to take the cheap tram (metro) We did have two dissapointments during our stay. Our taxi arranged by the hotel (30 euros one way Ataturk airport) was not there to meet us on arrival and only arrived after 2 phone calls to the hotel and 40 minutes after we cleared customs. As a side note, we took the Metro back to Ataturk for the return journey, cost us 4 turkish lire - less than 2 euro each - no delays and easy to do with back packs as luggage. Secondly the safe in our room could not be used as the key broke while in use by previous guests. We arrived with loads of cash and a safe in the room was one of my criteria for chosing this hotel however, Ramazan then locked our cash and other valuables in the hotel safe for us. We had a room over looking the street on the 5th floor, (large double) with balcony with chairs and small table from where we had bit of view of the Sea of Marmara to the left, an interesting hotel block in front and a lovely street view to the right. I think it was 501. This room is on the same level as the breakfast terrace and the balcony is adjacent to it, so if you peep over the balcony wall you have a breakfast table right next to it. As we had early breakfast, noise in this regard did not bother us but this also happened to be a favourite \"smokers corner\" and cigartette smoke could at times be smelt in our room and certainly on our balcony. It also was a bit of a schlepp to climb to the top floor but the advantage was we were in easy reach of the roof level and breakfast areas! Take note that there is a roof terrace one level higher than the breakfast terrace and you can enjoy your breakfast at the tables there! Just climb the circular staircase leading uup to it.We only discovered this on the 3rd day of our visit. The views from there are much better than at breakfast terrace level.

There are few convenient stores around the blocks and a shopping bazaar (Arasta, if not mistaken) nearby where you can shop for souvenirs. I like this small bakery outlet behind the Best Western Hotel (very nearby ) where you can buy cheap loafs and bread for snacks. The hotel surrounding was very quiet at night of which we slept like babies after a long tiring trips ; ) The staff were average, nothing above requirements.

In a little side street only minutes down hill from the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia and Topkapi Palace, this gem of a hotel is all you could wish for as a base for this extraordinary city. Small but perfectly formed, it has rooms over three floors. We had a middle sized room for 70 Euros a night, with en suite. The place feels very new so everything is spotless, the bed is comfy and the shower particularly good. (My hubby says we also have to mention the wifi which seemed to be available all over the building.) The best bit is the terraced roof, split over two levels (the upper one with a couple of hammocks for when your feet have been walked off!) and beautiful views over the Bosphorus. You take breakfast out here - a simple affair of bread, yoghurt, cheeses, fruit, pastries, olives, jam. Breakfast is the only service on offer, however, and there is no bar, but if you like it seemed no problem to buy a beer or two from one of the local shops and sample it on the roof while watching the sun set. No restaurant either, but there are several right on the doorstep - which in the end turned out to be as good as those frequented by Turks on the more commercial/residential side of the Straits, and certainly much much better than those found in the very touristy streets up around the Blue Mosque. We particularly recommend Ocean's 7. The hotel arranged a pick up from the airport (15 Euros) which is probably worth it because even if you took the very easy metro, then tram to Sultanhamet, the nearest stop, it would still be tricky to find. Once you know your way, however, the public transport back to the airport is a breeze, and very very cheap indeed. Istanbul isn't a quiet city, but in this little area we weren't troubled by any night time noise at all. Staff are charming, and most we met spoke English (useful since our Turkish is limited to please, thank you and two beers please).
