However, this past weekend was awful. I rented two rooms for my family on Friday and Saturday night. Our first night there 3 bus loads of high school students were there. They were loud and up all night. The next morning, house keeping began banging on doors and cleaning rooms prior to the check out time. So not only were we woken up by all the teens checking out and yelling down halls, we then heard vacuum cleaners and knocking. On Saturday night, I came back to the room early around 6pm. There were 3 rooms across from us screaming loudly and slamming doors. They all said they were getting ready to party. Okay, 6pm loudness no big deal. Then they came back at 11pm. Screaming at the top of their lungs up and down the hallway, whistling, slamming doors, etc. I thought they would calm down but by 11:45pm I was done and called the front desk. I tried to tell the man about what was going on but was rudely told he had someone at the counter and would take care of it when he had time. 20 minutes later, we heard someone knock on the doors near us. He politely asked them to keep it down and said thank you. The group left again after screaming many obscenities loudly when the front desk employee asked them to quiet down. Then they returned at 3:48am (yes, I remember the alarm clock). At least 4 to 5 people were singing in the hallway! This continued with whistling and more screaming. We could also smell cigarette smoke coming into our room. I cannot believe that no one downstairs could hear this. It went on for another hour and no one did anything. I did not call again because of the way I was treated before. My family member in the next room decided to wear earplugs to bed because of the prior night. When we checked out this morning, we were told that the staff Saturday night should have called a management member but did not and also the group would be put on the do not rent list. There was another group of people checking out from the other end of the second floor hallway complaining as well. A young lady, who looked as if she was still drunk and had makeup smudged all over her face, confronted me after I complained and stated that because Indianapolis is a college town and bars close at 3am, we should get used to it. I am in my 20s and have been in college myself. However, I never disrespected others around me as this group did. I cannot believe that the staff just sat back and did nothing.

Staff was very helpful with all our needs. We stayed for an entire week 2 times during the month of September. Staff went above and beyond and were very courteous and helpful with any and all of our needs. Will definately stay here when in the area again. Rates were good as well.

We booked adjoining rooms almost a year before we stayed. The rooms were confirmed the day before we got there and then when we did get there, we were informed that they had given one of the rooms away. Ok, not such a big deal. At least we still had two rooms. The first night, the sheets wouldnt stay on the bed. (too small) This was Nascar race weekend and everyone in Indiana knew this except apparently for the management at the hotel. The desk staff was friendly, but the other help was way understaffed. When we tried to have breakfast, we found no sausage gravy, no waffle mix and no orange juice. Unless you wanted toast, bagels or muffins, you were out of luck. I thought for sure the next morning would be better, but it was not. Once again they ran out of a lot of the breakfast options. The bathroom was very small and the tub was in rough shape. Two positives were the price (no one would stay there if they charged more) and the location.

It was essentially our only choice in our price range. Now, we wish we'd have gone ahead and paid a little more. The front desk staff were a bit slow but friendly. The first room we were assigned had smeared pizza on the carpet and when we alerted the staff they more than happy to assign us a new room. The hotel is sporting a banner that announces that they have all new rooms which isn't all together true. It appears some of the decor and bedding are fairly new, but the airconditioner wasn't and the bathroom tub wasn't either. The bathroom, overall, was not satisfactory. The sink faucet hadn't been properly installed and leaked water everytime you turned it on. The bathroom itself was tiny and we bumped our elbos and shoulders several times. The fixture that had been placed over the tub was cheap with the paint/surface peeling off in huge sheets. The beds were fairly comfortable, but one of the bed skirts was dirty and I couldn't help but be bothered by the stain everytime I looked at it. Housekeeping comes around quite early which is frustrating if you are looking to sleep in past 8:30. Doesn't matter whether you place the \"Do not Disturb\" sign on the door or not because the door and walls are so thin, when they knock on your neighbors door it's like they knocking on yours. The hotel offers breakfast but this info was nowhere when I booked on line and no one bothered to mention it when we checked in so we ate elsewhere. Overall, if you can find somewhere else to say, I'd advise you to do so. The location is convenient but aside from that, the place is lacking.", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oconomowoc, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cNice room at the Jameson Inn\u201d", "Author": "Georgetraveller", "ReviewID": "UR10116103", "Content": "We were delighted to see that the room had been refurbished.
