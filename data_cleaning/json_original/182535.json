The owner met my wife and family and was totally gracious--in fact, we were four hours late checking in, but he did not mention that. We had a free upgrade to a three bedroom from a Grand Executive, so the children each got a their own room as did my wife and I. The suite decor was so clean and the interior decorating unbelievably co-ordinated. (The owner said his mother does all the suites individually.) Our suite had brand new wooden shutters and everything was so totall clean! We quickly took advantage of using the lovely garden, enjoying an evening galss of wine there. All the things to see and do in Vancouver were so handy to Pendrell Suites, it was perfect for us. English Bay is a five minute walk, Stanley Park maybe eight. The proprietors answered all our questions and recommended which restaurants might interest us. Indeed, Granville Island is but 12 minutes away, including the little ferry there BY FOOT. We received a free tour of the Suite used as Agent Scully's on X-Files--we qualified because we booked for a week--we could not believe how many movies and TV shows had used the place as a locate: over 55, including Chinese Television! If you can get space here, you best do it immediately because it is going global--a huge number of Hollywood movie stars stay here while filming in Vancouver, BTW. In sum, my children have had the experience of a lifetime. My wife and I have enoyed a 5 star property and suite fir the price of a four star one--and I am not counting the movie tour, either. Exceptional. Don't miss it!", "Date": "September 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cStay away, stay far away!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Robbie11", "ReviewID": "UR5618045", "Content": "The owner did not disclose our room rates and additional charges he intended to charge at time of check in, not to mention being very uncustomer friendly.

The suite was wonderful (clean, large, etc.) and the building itself is in a very nice location. It is very near the park and a funky area with lots of shops and restaurants. No complaints about the physical set-up. On the negative side, it was quite expensive -- and there was no housekeeping. Make your own beds, wash your own dishes and reuse the towels. I am not sure whether this is a once-a-week kind of housekeeping set-up or what, but we paid a lot of dough for no service whatsoever. We won't be staying there again.

We had communicated with the management a lot before we arrived. Specifically we wanted to be away from any construction during our stay, so we looked carefully at our options. We were assured there was no nearby construction. We got to our suite, I opened the kitchen window and 3 feet away the building next door was being completely renovated. We listened to saws and nail guns every day! The owner said he forgot the place next door was under construction! We stayed in their \"nicest suite\" - this translated to mold, mildew, plastic covered mattresses, horribly stained carpet, worn out furniture, and decor from the 1980's (at best!). We didn't even unpack our clothes because the dresser looked like something from Salvation Army! The floors creaked and we heard every foot step (and bump and suitcase wheel) from the place above us. Window coverings were inadequate so street lights poured in. The blender and blow dryer were so old they still had double prong plugs (no third grounding post), and the blender was filthy, as well as having a frayed cord. We found dried food on dishes and cutting boards. The owner was never available so we were stuck to communicate with none English speaking staff. When we had to leave a day earlier than planned due to family illness, the owner charged us for the extra day. There is no service to bring you more towels (and, believe me, you only get the bare minimum), washclothes, kitchen towels. So, you call and hope someone is around. The parking is terrible. And there is no trash receptacle outside - I have no idea where our trash was supposed to go. There were no recycling bins. And the heat in the rooms is unpredictable. One of our rooms was so hot, we turned the heat off - but it never went off! We finally had to open a window just to cool off. This place is not maintained, not kept clean, and not into any kind of customer service. The owner tries to make it look like he's being very personal by having a printed welcome letter with your name on it when you arrive. But that's about all you'll ever see of personal service. Oh, we had a fax machine with no paper in it, too. Forget the fax I was supposed to get! This owner is more interested in his \"X Files\" Tours (I guess that how the place got popular is the filming of part of that show there). When we arrived we couldn't speak with him (about the construction) because he was busy setting up an X Files Reunion. It's hard to find accomodations with more than one or two bedrooms (we checked everywhere) - we found our choices to be limited to The Meridian and the Lord Stanley. Maybe we would have been better off at one of those! I definitely say take this one off your list. Or bring you own appliances, dishes, towels, ear plugs, allergy medicine and mattress!!", "Date": "April 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, CA", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "LesterB", "ReviewID": "UR2803962", "Content": "Made a spur of the moment business trip to Vancouver, the company travel agent made our reservations at Pendrell Suites.

The suite we stayed in was immaculately clean. I am not just referring to the bathrooms or the kitchen: I am a referring to the entire suite, including the baseboards, hardwood floors, windows, garden, etc. Regarding the unaccomadating comment posted, we also have to disagree.
