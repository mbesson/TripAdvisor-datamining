We stayed in a suite, which was lovely and very comfortale. Breakfast every morning was delicious, but we did not eat dinner in the hotel. The only downside was the internet was very expensive and I actually never got to use it because of some problem with the connection.

A lot of hotels are by the train station, which is a scummy area, and I know people whose impressions of Rome have been tainted by this.

It's a stones throw from the Spanish Steps and within spitting distance of lovely bars and restaurants. Also, the metro is close by, just a skip across the piazza. We had a junior standard suite and loved everything about it. Lots of room. Separate room from the bedroom with a sofa and table and chairs was fantastic. Television in the bedroom was great and both rooms had windows overlooking the courtyard, which we could open completely and let air flow through. Bathroom was excellent also, and included a bidet. AND we had a kitchenette, which was useful. The maid cleaned every day. Everything just felt so fresh and airy. Bliss. Breakfast was nice, lots of choice. You could tell who the Brits were though, hanging around for more bacon, and the sausage isn't sausage as i know it but you never seriously go to the continent expecting a decent fry up to you? Lots of coffee, tea, fresh fruit, bread, condiments, pastry and juice. I love Rome and can't wait to go back. I think this hotel may have played a part in nurturing that love.

Also there is an air conditioning and heating system and internet for a reasonable price. Either 10 euros for 1 day or 20 euros for 3 days! There are rooms that face the garden or onto via di ripetta. I suggest the ones facing the garden, there is not as much noise as the ones that face onto via di ripetta. Breakfast is included and it's very diverse. There is scrambled eggs with sausage or bacon, variety of different cakes and pastries, different types of juices, cereal and deli items. Overall I was very impressed with breakfast. The rooms are cleaned each day and each day you have clean sheets and a new set of towels. Also there is a refridgerator in each room with a variety of beverages. However you must pay for them if you drink them that also goes for the snacks that come with the room. The service in general is excellent. There is always someone at the desk who can help you with anyone of your questions. Angelo is very professional and not only speaks english and italian but also spanish and french. He has been there the longest so if you need to ask something you should ask him. Every thursday and sunday there is a happy hour from 7:30pm - 10:30pm. It is either hosted in the inner garden which is spectacular or in the inside bar. I suggest that at least one night you should go to the happy hour, its fun and the music is great. Good way to meet some new people. Also every sunday there is a brunch at 12:30pm. There is a buffet and depending on the weather you can either sit in the garden or inside. The food overall is great!. You can also have a party there seeing as there are many different rooms. Not only is it good for pleasure but also for business. There are a total of 7 different rooms and depending on your business meeting you can choose any of the rooms.

Not once in this 3-week stay did i have to wait for a hot capuchino in the morning. The staff at the desk and around the hotel were willing to help 24/7, which is more than enough. This was a solo trip, but i was entertained by what each room had to offer. The TV's are large and very nice. One feature that i found was that you can purchase internet, movies and everything else for use on the TV for only 15 Euros per day! Even more exciting was the mini fridge, which was alredy full with any drink i so desiered. Angelo at the desk spoke very good english and pointed out ways i could get to places like the Spanish steps and the Pantheon. Even more helpful was that the desk could call a taxi from the hotel! Even when Angelo was not there, the rest of the staff was willing to help out anyone who nedded it. In general, the residenza is very spacious and cozy.

Angelo at the front desk was able to speak excellent English and assist with our early check-in so we could get to our tour of the Vatican without worrying about our luggage. He also gave us a free map of the city (highlighting the places we wanted to go) that easily got us around. Ervin was a sweetheart. He waited on us for dinner and always seemed to be around when you needed something. Our food that evening and the cont. breakfast the next day were amazing. We are very picky and healthy eaters, and were able to find plenty things to eat reasonably at RdR. The location was perfect for us. Easy to get to the subway, a taxi or a bus if you need to. I picked this area because we wanted to do the \"Night walk\" from Rick Steves' Italy book. This hotel is at the end of the walk, so we saw the whole heart of the city from 2 different angles in the same night walking to the start one way, and returning the way the book recommends. Highly recommend this book and the tips/places he highly recommends. Our whole 2 weeks in Italy it was our go to resource, and we were never disappointed. Our room was tiny, maybe the smallest one in the place, but it was clean and comfortable. The beds in Italy in general suck, and this was the best mattress by far. Great shower and updated bathroom, just outdated room. Honestly, we could care less about that as long as it was clean.

We were in Rome in July 2011 meeting up with friends who were staying at The First Luxury Hotel right next door. We did our research and looked for a hotel that was better priced than their hotel which was about $400 a night and finally narrowed our pick to this hotel. The lobby and common areas are very nice but the rooms and staff leave alot to be desired for the price that was paid. The rooms are very old with ugly dirty yellow carpeting, the bed is not comfortable with just a small sheet and 2 very small pillows. The rooms are suites so they are spacious but the decorating is very outdated and very dark and just make everything feel old and very dirty. The washroom look clean but also very old but the shower was terrible as it was a small stream of water and took almost 2 minutes to get your entire body wet. Our safe was broken and we called to the front desk to ask for someone to come and look at it and the answer we recieved was \"there is nothing we can do\" so we had to take our passports and valuables next door to our friends hotel. Since the rooms use only old key locks you can not get an extra key. Our fuse in our room blew twice and my bf had the switch the fuse as the staff was taking a while to come and help us out. I personally was not impressed with this hotel and would not recommend the hotel to someone else. We did not eat in the common areas so we can not rate the food but the hotel food was very expensive.

This put a very sour note to the end of an otherwise fantastic trip.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cUNFORTUNATELY BAD...\u201d", "Author": "Egli_1980", "ReviewID": "UR80821197", "Content": "We visited Rome for our honeymoon and we chose \"Residenza di Ripetta\" because of the reviews of Tripadvisor and the location. First of all as per the location was great and very close to almost everywhere.. But this was the only great thing about the hotel. When we first entered we faced a huge mess.. The hotel was under re-construction, there were workers everywhere who were painting all the walls around and making noise.. The employees there were everything but kind and helpful. No one knew if we were staying at the hotel, neither our room number etc. As per the rooms.. OMG! Awfull, just awfull! Broken walls, a blue dirty carpet (with chips on it), towels that were smelling like dead people and very very noisy plumping! All furniture were very old (probably since early 60's-70's) and a fantastic view to the workers outside..! No one ever informed us that the hotel would be under re-construction and when we sent an email before our arrival - just to confirm our room and reservation - they simply never answered us! So kind and helpful.. I would definetely never go to that place again and of course would NEVER recommend it to anyone else..! Very very... very BAD! So sad for such a historic place and building.. shame on them.. P.S. We only rated the hotel for its location, which was really fantastic", "Date": "September 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "York", "Title": "\u201cCentrally located, clean and comfortable hotel\u201d", "Author": "50somethingyork", "ReviewID": "UR76924904", "Content": "We stayed at the Residenza di Ripetta for one week in the middle of August. The hotel is very conveniently located less than five minutes walk from the Piazza del Popolo and the Spanish Steps. We were able to walk to all the great sights of Rome, the Colosseum, the Vatican, the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, the Jewish Ghetto, Trastevere, etc. We were welcomed by very helpful English speaking staff. Our rooms were very spacious - we travelled with our 20 year old son and both our rooms had a sitting area (with sofa bed) a dining table and chairs, a two ring hob and small sink, a large refrigerator, crockery, cutlery and pans so that we could \"eat in\" if we chose. The very large beds were firm but comfortable, the rooms were airconditioned and very peaceful - no traffic or any other noise! The hotel was in the process of some refurbishment whilst we were there and the rooms we had were certainly a little faded so maybe they are due for redecoration? The TV only had one English channel - BBC world news. There is an internet room for guests use in the lobby of the hotel. 5 euros for an hour or 10 euros for 24 hours. The breakfast buffet was generally good - fruit juices, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage, scrambled egg, cereals, pastries, bread rolls, cakes and hot drinks. Our only criticisms of the hotel would have to be that neither of our rooms had any view whatsoever - they looked out onto a rendered wall. If we were staying there again we would ask for a room with a view of the internal courtyard which was well tended and a nice place to sit, having chairs and tables with parasols. The other disappointment was that the roof terrace was rather neglected - much of the planting was dead or dying through lack of water and it seemed to us that it was a really useful space which could have been made much better use of by the hotel - a plunge pool would have been good and perhaps a bar or cafe - but there may not be sufficient demand? We also thought that the hotel bar/restaurant should have opened longer - it seemed to close by about 7.30 p.m. - we would certainly have gone into the bar for a \"nightcap\" had it been open when we got back into the hotel after dinner at one of the many local restaurants. The transfer time from the FCO airport was about 25 mins. by city taxi (white cars) which operate at a standard rate of 40 euros each way - don't get persuaded into another type of taxi at the airport (there are lots of touts) as it will cost you a lot more!!", "Date": "August 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLacks style and charm but sleeps well\u201d", "Author": "robertguarnieri", "ReviewID": "UR76867640", "Content": "Big, bland rooms.

The breakfast is described as \" American\" so my son expected pancakes and waffles which were not on offer ( so he stayed in bed after the first morning) but a good selection of cereal, pastry goods, fruit, yoghurts and a hot selection were available. The table was constantly topped up right until the bitter end so everyone got the full choice. The location of the hotel was very good. A couple of minutes from the metro providing liknks to all the major attractions but within 10 minutes walk of the spanish steps and trevi fountain.
