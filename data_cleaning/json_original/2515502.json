In general, I found the staff to be very kind and helpful. When I checked in, the lady at the front desk gave me a choice of the two rooms that were available at the time.

Unfortunately, during the rest of my stay in San Diego, 10,000 athletes also came to San Diego and there were quite a few staying at the Radisson. I did not appreciate the fact that there were kids running up and down the corridors and yelling late at night in light of the fact that I had early mornings.

I read them before I stayed there and trusted them. I was wrong and they are wrong. I stayed there one night while visiting the Wild Animal Park with my fiance, and we'll never go back there again. First of all, for the price you pay, it sure feels like you're staying at a cheap motel with outdoor walkways and room entrances. The rooms are old and out of date. The television was old school and had terrible reception. The wi-fi didn't work properly and was difficult to connect to and very slow once connected. The breakfast was terrible. Not much selection and everything tasted cold and bland. Even the key to the door didn't work properly. I thought maybe it was just me putting in the key incorrectly, or that particular lock or key acting up, but I saw the neighbors also locked out of their room, so I know this is problematic for the hotel. There's not very many people around the hotel and I'm sure they're struggling financially, so I'm not surprised by the aging condition of the facilities. I was sent a survey by the hotel after my stay and told them all the same things I mentioned here. I received an email back from the hotel manager who said, in summary, sorry for your experience, come back again. Really? Now I came back to this site to read all the positive reviews and felt compelled to write the truth. It's obvious that hotel insiders are writing phony glowing reviews because no one is dumb enough to pay in excess of $100 per night for what amounts to a Motel 6 experience, then write a good review.

We chose the hotel because they allow pets and their pet fee was way below the other properties. We, unfortunately, came to find out there's a reason this property was so much cheaper. I stayed in the car as he checked in. When the doors from the outside opened, music was blaring from a party booked in the party room. A buffet was set up for this party right in the lobby and children were running around all over the place -- at 11:00pm!!!!! The only saving grace to this property is the staff. They took the first night off the bill for the inconvenience. They have a bend-over-backwards attitude which is even sometimes absent at the finest resorts. The rooms are gloomy. We could not tell if the sofa was old and dirty or just really ugly. The room, however, was spacious. It was somewhat clean, however the coffee maker was dingy. The look is weird. The bedding looks somewhat new. The beds look old. The towel rod in the showe rod feel and cut my foot. The wallpaper in the bathroom and sink basin look new. The tub walls are white, yet the tub itself is an old and dingy yellow. The bathroom has only a sliding door which stays slightly open. The bathroom is very small. The property itself leaves much to be desired. It is really a 3-story cramped motel. Many of the guests on Saturday night chose to drink beer shirtless at the outdoor halls. The parking is very limited. The pool is in very close proximity to the inside courtyard rooms and the acoustics are terrible. This seems to be a bit of an \"event\" hotel. As mentioned, they book parties in their facility which is also very close to rooms. On the positive/negative side, the loud air conditioning covered the noise. Young soccer teams were booked into the hotel. The staff offered to change our room because it was close to the party area, but we discovered it was the \"bride room\" for a nearby wedding. However, kudos again to the great staff for holding a room aside for us to check. Also, a note if you want to visit the attractions of San Diego. Rancho Bernardo is to the north.

Really a good variety, just don't expect high-quality. Every adult does get 1 free alcoholic beverage each evening, which is nice. The Grill also serves dinner as well.
