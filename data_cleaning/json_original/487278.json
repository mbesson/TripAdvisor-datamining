{"Reviews": [{"Content": "hard to find hotel Hotel is hard to find especially at night with all the exits from the train and subway station. best bet is to take a taxi and find your back to rail in the morning. taxi is less than 1000 yen :-)room is small (as all tokyo rooms are), very clean and has everything you would expect a room in the states to have. front desk speak little english and give poor directions....better off getting a map and finding your own way. good location to see anything in tokyo and get to haneda airport by monorail.", "Date": "Mar 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR465998918", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "sora21"}, {"Content": "Pretty good value business hotel Just got back from a three-day stay at this hotel. Company put me up, so it didn't come out of my pocket but for those of you paying your own way, it's not a bad value. Good points: Relatively large room for a business hotel. I've stayed in a bunch of them all over Japan. Room was really clean. Bad points: street / train noise. I had a third floor room and didn't appreciate the rumbling from outside. Also, it's about halfway between JR Hamamatsucho and Hinode Station on the Yurikamome, so take your pick for transport. It's probably closer to Hinode. Front desk service is polite, but it helps if you can speak a little Japanese.", "Date": "May 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR464472211", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "\u6910\u546b\u4eb1\u9288\u5910\u4ee9\u9287\u5b28\u4eef\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(20412959, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR619110527", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "tarepanda-a"}, {"Content": "Optimale Lage   showReview(11667276, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR432439319", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066451-d487278-r7013317-Chisun_Hotel_Hamamatsucho-Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "487278", "Price": "$179"}}
