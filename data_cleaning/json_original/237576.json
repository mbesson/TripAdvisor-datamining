We arrived at the hotel at 3:30pm, an hour and a half after check in time started, greeted by a scruffy pot head who needed a wash. The reception stank of Weed and made us feel quite sick. The room wasn't ready and we were told it wasn't their fault but the guests' who stayed there before because they hadn't left yet!! We were told to go wander around and come back around 5-6pm! Luckily when I complained (as we had friends to meet) they took us upstairs to check if the room was ready (so this wasn't even known to them or not) and said we could have the room. Here's a list of the problems: The window wouldn't shut - a 2\" gap to be precise letting all kinds of nightlife sound freely into the room on one of Amsterdam's busiest streets. The toilet had a leak in the U-Bend meaning each flush would allow water to overflow all over the bathroom floor - I repeat TOILET WATER The toilet hadn't been flushed after the last guests had used it - it was dirty The sink had bits of what looked like Vomit all over it There was no toilet paper There were no towels, finally we were given towel which had stains in them and were ancient. The shower was broken. The TV didn't work The photos were not real We were woken up the following day by the strange looking housekeeper (male) who was actually IN THE ROOM standing AT THE EDGE OF THE BED, he had not knocked the door and the room has no intercom so of course we hadn't received any call to wake us up.

I got the impression it was probably a proper hotel about 20 years ago and then the management decided a good way to cut cost was to stop maintaining it. I expect the pictures advertising the hotel were taken before the maintenance stopped. Be warned, this hotel now looks nothing like the pictures! The thing that really got me was the state of the bathroom. The shower was literally black with mould. The dampness was so bad it had caused holes in the ceiling right above the toilet. I did wonder if there could be a camera at the other side of these holes (it would not surprise me with this place). Then when you come out the shower you get to dry yourself with a 20-year-old towel with nice big holes in it. The door of the room didn't lock right as it had been kicked in at some point and never sorted. None of the lights worked because they had no bulbs in them. The bed linen had the same problem as the towels and it did make you wonder how many bed bugs you were sleeping with. I noticed three reviews actually gave this place 5 stars. Two of these review weren't in English so I can't comment. The one that was in English is from someone called Bill.

What a mistake! For a price of \u00c2\u00a365 per night, special offer down from \u00c2\u00a3 85 according to expedia, I did not expect luxury, but neither this: I had rung the doorbell for 5 minutes when another guest let me in, and it took another few minutes until the hotel owner appeared in a football shirt and grubby trousers. When I asked him where to get the breakfast, it turned out that it was not included in the price because there was none on offer \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only my son does one in his hotel down the road\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The steep and narrow staircase led to an attic room with one chair, two double beds, three night tables with one ashtray and three lamps, but there was no light connected to the switch at the door. The small wardrobe had 4 plastic shop hangers, one still with the label for the clothes size. There was no phone, the lamp next to the TV had neither bulb nor shade, and where the plaster board crumbled on the wall, there was a paper sticker - to hold it together? The only thing renewed in the bathroom in the last forty years had been the toilet. There were two bare bulbs on the ceiling, but neither soap nor any kind of glass by the sink. The good feature was the location: straight in the middle of dozens of bars and pubs to choose from, but that was also the bad feature: even with closed window the beat from the disco underneath kept me awake until three. All this seems bad enough, but the really bad news were the standards of hygiene. My heart already sank when I waited outside the front door and I saw the carpet on the staircase: the dirtiest one I have ever seen in my life, and the walls hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been painted in forty years I guess. Up to reception the handrail was fake brass, up to the first floor plastic, and from then on wood where the paint had peeled off and it was sticky from many sweaty hands. When I opened to door to the room, the first thing that hit me was the smell of must and cigarettes. The carpet had loads of holes and loads of stains. When I took the bed cover away I found a crisp clean pillow case and sheet, but the pillow case was open on the side and unfortunately I got a glimpse of the pillow underneath. When I picked up the duvet, there was dark fluff underneath and it looked as if somebody had already slept in it; I checked out the other three, but they all looked the same. But even if it had been washed and they just never bother ironing those, I wonder where it picked up the fluff. And finally there was the shower: the ceiling covered in mould, signs of more mould in the grouting and the bottom end of the shower curtain was a rotting orange. And when, in desperation, I tried to have a shower nevertheless, the water did not come from the shower head, but poured from a hole in the pipe at the bottom. Although the room was already paid for through expedia, I tried to get another hotel, but only succeeded for the second night, so had no choice but spending the first one there. When I handed my keys in in the morning and told them I would not come back in the evening because the place was so awful, the only response was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alright.

What a relief it was to step into a clean room and have a shower the next evening at the IBIS - all the way out at the airport, but who cares! Although the tripadvisor, as I have now seen too late, has plenty of reviews with warnings, you would not expect any of this when you see the official photos on the site. But beware: neither this reception nor the nice and clean receptionist exist in the hotel! (To start with, there is no window behind the actual reception desk.)

She was so friendly the first day or so. When we were checking out, she made up a checkout fee of 20 euros and claimed she told us about it, which definitely never happened. She's just money-hungry. She didn't want us to have a third room because she didn't want to have to \"wash\" more sheets.

One of ours looked like a metal cone, and the other one was just like a metal booey. The stairs were narrow and steep. Also, it is right across from a club, and the windows don't shut completely, so the noise comes in, and it is quite hard to sleep.

Nowhere near the red light district and a fair distance from the train station but there are regular trams to it. Great if you want to party all night but avoid if y ou like to be in bed by 10, it's directly opposite a really loud and busy club which doesnt shut up til about 3.30am and there's no double glazing. ACCESS 24 hours access (you get given a front door key) although they lock the front door at 11 so if you intend to check in after that its best to ring them. Absolutely not suitable for anyone with mobility problems...its a flight of stairs to reception then another to the first floor of rooms, I think there are 3 floors of rooms so a minimum of 2 flights of stairs and no lift. The stairs are also very narrow with very narrow steps so if you are planning on going out and getting wasted be aware you will have a mammoth task in front of you getting back! STAFF We had very little to do with them but they seemed very friendly and polite and efficient. FACILITIES Rooms are basic. They are kept clean and cleaned and tidied every day but decor is tired. Bedlinen is very old and very thin (not great if you have an incredibly slow metabolism like me!) No air con, marks on the carpets but it was clean. Our window was propped open by a paving slab. TV with lots of channels including english. We had an ensuite which again was basic and old but clean and perfectly adequate. Some damp patches especially in the ceiling outside our door. Basically its an old building that probably needs refurbishing but as their main clientele are probably drunks who are going to make a mess and just want cheap accomodation why bother, it's not cost effective, the location pretty much limits it to party animals. I must stress though, the rooms were clean (and we weren't disturbed once by any other patrons). There is a bar in reception but we didn't use it and never saw anyone else use it, you're so close to so many bars why bother with the hotel one? TO BE AWARE Breakfast isn't free, they charge 5 euros a person a day. We didn't take this up as there are plenty of places to eat nearby (avoid the breakfast at the Bulldog Cafe though, it's rubbish) so I have no idea how good it is. On top of the price they charge for room there is a 5% tourist tax which is standard for amsterdam however this hotel also charges another 5% if you want to pay by your card so I would reccomend getting enough cash out (there's an ATM on the square about a 2 minute walk away but it doesn't always work) If you just want a cheap place to crash after a hard nights partying this hotel is perfect.
