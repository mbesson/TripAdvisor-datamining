{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very Disappointed with Samsara I have been to Bali many times and know what to expect with different accomodation types, My recent stay at this hotel was very disapointing. The room was very basic, no phone or coffee making facilities. The worst part was the water, the water coming out of the shower was saltly, I have never had that in Bali before even in 2 star. Everytime I wanted to buy a drink, I had to go to the kitchen and asked to be served, and I always had to ask for ashtrays. On a few occasions I had to wait up to half an hour to have breakfast as there were not enough tables for the quests. The staff were very nice and helpful but I found it could have been better managed. We paid top dollar to stay at the Samara, and have stayed in much better hotels for the same money. I will never stay gain and will not recommend it.", "Date": "Apr 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR880469774", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Boongie"}, {"Content": "Serviciable - just don't expect the Hilton! Although I'm used to staying in pretty nice hotels (perks of my job) I didn't expect much from Samsara beyond a nice bed to sleep in at night while visiting Bali.I liked the decor of the rooms - simple and functional (but it didn't have a closet - more like a ledge for you to put your stuff on and a a rod for you to hang clothes) and each room came with a television and two bottles of mineral water and 2 glasses. My friend and I weren't used to a hotel room without an electric kettle, but we soon realised why - the water from the pipes were salty! Ugh. Imagine brushing your teeth and bathing with salt water. But apparently, another friend of mine who stayed in another hotel also said the water was salty. Perhaps it's a Bali problem more than anything else.You must go through a narrow alley to get to the hotel from the main road. It can get very creepy at night as it's not well lit.Very near eating places and shops - thumbs up to the location, though it's a good 30 minutes walk to Kuta beach.It would've been great if not for the fact that a) the air conditioning was sub par. It barely cooled the room, and since the windows could not be opened you can't do anything but suffer in the heat. There was a power outtage on our second day there, and we had to sleep in the darkness in the stuffy heat for an hour. Not fun. On the last day the air conditioner failed completely - it stopped cooling the room and started dripping water onto the curtains.Also, the shower area flooded constantly and on one night, burped up something stinky. egh.Have to say that I'm eyeing another place when I'm going back to Bali next!", "Date": "Feb 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR582789078", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "GlobeTrot76"}, {"Content": "It WOW us!

Location: down a narrow little dirty lane surrounded be 1 star hotels No security at all. Rooms: no natural light or air, lots of bugs and the air con was mouldly letting out a horrible riek. Breakfast: very basic hard old bread, choices are very limited.(eggs and bacon and tomato cooked in masses of oil) hotel pool: slimy with lice in it. never seen the pool cleaned for the whole trip. No phones in room or mini bar or hairdryer or tea/coffee making facilites. The hotel spa is very limited and extremely small.The hotel is very small as soon as you step in you can see the whole place- hence everyone knows everyone. Over our time at Samsara we experiened lots of drunks and rowdey behaviour around the wee hrs of the morning (6am). Also fighting and yelling among other hotel guest- as all they do is sit around the pool all day and drink. Alot of single males bringing the bali girls back to the rooms. Not the place to go if you just want to chill and be normal. Overall the staff were friendly and helpful, however this still didn't compensate the other areas of the hotel", "Date": "Jan 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR390915205", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "AustraliaUglybetty"}, {"Content": "loved Stayed at Samsara hotel for two weeks, staff were very pleasant and helpful, food was pleasant.

Coming back to the hotel each day was returning to a safe and peaceful haven. Samsara is a tranqil oasis right in the heart of bustling Kuta. You can be as noisy or as quiet as you like here. The place has a great ambience. There is always lots of friendly faces around to have a chat and a drink if you feel like being social, or you can just as easily relax by the pool with a good book undisturbed. The staff are always eager to help with any requests and always have a smile on their faces. Samsara has a lovely spa room for massages etc or have a pedicure by the pool. The a la carte breakfast was delish with lovely fresh tropical fruit, a cooked breakfast of your choice, pastries, toast and condiments, and freshly squeezed juices and Balii coffee. Alwyas started the day with a full stomach. The rooms are basic but comforable with a large bar fridge to keep your own drinks etc. I would highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "Nov 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR935695125", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "fastcar72"}, {"Content": "Lovely little boutique hotel I found the Samsara just lovely. The staff were friendly, helpful and always happy to help. There is a fridge in the room but no minibar - perfect!! Minibar prices are always so incredibly overprices so why not buy my own drinks and keep them cold. Hairdryers are provided in each room and there is a lovely little spa room on the ground floor - very easily accessible. There is lovely artwork placed around the hotel.Overall ... with all the rooms facing the pool, it creates a very friendly atmosphere with a lot of the guests mingling and chatting in or around the pool. The location of the hotel is great - just off the main street with shops, bars, restaurants just all a short walk away!! I loved my stay and can't wait to go back.

Stayed at the Samsara in December with my sister . We chose this hotel for it's location and its advertised Spa......First of all there was no spa , not one that we could see anyway, secondly one night a group of drunken people partied all night ( from 2am )right outside our room and the barman partied with them. The hotel brochure in the room advised to phone reception if there was a disturbance ......but the rooms do not have phones ( or a minibar or hairdryer ). when I complained the next day the same staff member was still on duty and he apologised saying they were crazy kiwis and he could not control them, the hotel does not have security guards so there was little he could do........ not very good when the hotel is marketed toward female tourists. The staff did the best they could but the management was nowhere to be seen.

When i got there, i asked why the phone call only directed to voice mail and they told me that they just change the number 3 days ago!! What a coincident!! The room is clean and comfortable enough... But i found it strange that it has a safebox there, but no hair dryer nor minbar?? The priority of comfort seem to be a bit mixed up here... And there's not enough one hanger on the rack!!! I ended up hanging my clothes on the rail itself..Hotel staff are friendly, but the management seriously need some major improvement...
