I booked the Y City South after alot of searching for a decent hotel within my budget. I didnt want to stay at a Backpackers this time around, so I landed on this hotel. The reviews on the hotel are pretty much true. Sydney Accomodation is expensive! So you cant expect much if you are not willing to pay for it. The photos that you can find on here and other parts of the internet are the same as what I would be putting up here. I arrived early, and even though my room wasnt ready, but there is a room for my luggage - free of charge. Fantastic! Allthough they do just let people in the room, so I would keep a lock on your luggage. The hotel is walking distance to Central Station, but closer to Redfern. Although from Central, you can either catch a train closer into town, the free loop bus, or the City Sightseeing tour. On arrival to my room, the first thing I thought was \"Boy it IS small. The Double bed was against the wall, and the space in between the other was just enough to fit my suitcase in without tripping over it. It has a desk, a kettle, hair dryer, iron and board, a bar fridge, a tv (digital, no cable, and not all of the channels are connected), your own toilet and shower, towels, and complimentary soaps and coffee / sugar / milk sachets. The bathroom is small, and as a bigger person, I would have preferred a bit more room, but it did the job. In saying all of this, if you are like me, I use my hotel room to store my luggage and sleep in. If I wanted to be in my hotel room for the entire day, I would have made sure that I got a more expensive option. I woke up, got ready, came back, went to sleep. And it was fine. The housekeepers make up your room during the day. Bed and towels only. But make sure you check under your bed when you leave. I found a pair of my shoes! Breakfast is cereal and toast. If you want a hot breakfast there are numerous cafes in town or a 5-10 minute walk away. Breakfast should really stay open until checkout though, 9.30 is just not long enough. BBQ and rooftop area was closed for renovations, so I cant comment. I know on some sites it says that they have a Gym, but it was nowhere in sight. I was running a tad late and checked out a 10 on the dot, but there was a few people after me and they had no problems either. There was a staff member who was a bit sleazy, and I tried to steer clear of him at all costs. He was very unprofessional and it wasn't a good look for the hotel. The other staff were friendly but not over welcoming.

I did not know that I have to give a hotel 48 hours of move/ check-out notice. This is the FIRST ever hotel in the world that I come across with such unreasonable policy. I was not told at check-in day about this policy or when booking. Also, as for the definition of cancellation, it does not fit for my case, as I did not cancel the booking, but I stayed one night there. And, was charged for a service (2nd night) that I did NOT receive. As a consumer/customer, we do not pay for service not received. Most importantly, please allow me the reason I had to move out of the hotel. The hotel air conditioning is NOT maintain at all. Hygiene standard in the hotel is very poor! I was coughing non-stop and having allergic (could NOT even sleep!) for the entire night, caused by the mold, bacteria, debris and particles emitting by the air conditioner. I DO NOT want to be infected with Legionellosis, a fatal infectious disease that killed a group of people attended the convension of American Legion in 1976 due to the Legionella bacteria from dirty and unserviced air conditioning. To me, it is the responsibility of Y Hotel to maintain its air conditioning system and provide clean air for its customers, but this is not being fulfilled at all by Y Hotel. And, it is a law in USA for every commercial place (including hotels) to have their air conditioning and cooling systems be serviced and cleaned periodically. Is this not in Australia? (Attached photos of Y Hotel air conditioning with thick layers of dust, debris, particles and mold inside the duct). Also, I had to see a doctor to get medication for the allergy caused by the polluted air emitted from the air conditioning. I had to fork out medical fees after staying one night in such a dirty hotel. So, do you think the hotel should compensate my medical fees instead? So, I am questioning if this policy still apply for my case. I am unlucky that I had to pay one night for the nightmare in Y Hotel but I am NOT willing to pay for the additional night that I did not stay (and will not ever stay!). Regards.

I wanted to be near one of the city's train station, and the hotel is located near both Central Station and Redfern station. I also needed to budget wisely, and if you don't know, Sydney is a very expensive city. From what I hear and discovered first hand, it is the most expensive city in all of Australia. From these two necessities, I decided on this hotel. Location: The hotel is actually closer to Redfern station than to Central. Redfern station is a 5 minute walk, and it's really just 1 long block. Central is about 15 minutes away, walking, and can be a bit daunting at first. There's a lot of vehicle traffic and not as much foot traffic. So you may be a bit intimidated by the lack of pedestrians and worry about your safety. I wouldn't advise walking from the hotel to Central, or vice versa, at night. In my opinion, Redfern is the wiser choice. There is actually a police station right across the street from the train station. Plus there is a lot of car traffic so you don't feel alone when walking the one block. It's faster and the station is less hectic than Central. I actually was walking from the station to the hotel after midnight and it was perfectly fine. In fact, there were police cars doing random alcohol testing at that time, so it couldn't have been safer. Hotel Service: You get what you pay for. If you're looking for conceirge service, room service, or great service, you will not find it here. The staff will help you, but you have to ask them. And oftentimes repeatedly. They'll give you this look as if they're paying you and not the other way around, but they will work with you. You just have to be patient. I found the cleaning staff to be a lot friendlier than the people behind the reception desk. Just don't expect a lot of bells and whistles here. Again, you get what you pay for. Complimentary Breakfast: Syndey is expensive. If you can save a buck here and there, you can really use it during your outings. One of the things I liked about the hotel was the free breakfast. Nothing fancy, but it's free. You get unlimited coffee, juice (orange or apple), cereal (6 types), bread/toast. I spend about 30 minutes there each morning filling up. This way, I only get something to drink if I'm thirsty during the day, and then I have the chance to really splurge on dinner. I end up only having to pay for one meal a day. Just to highlight how expensive things are in Sydney. An average sandwich in the United States with drink and chips included may run you about $8. In Sydney, you're looking at $12 minimum. Room: Ok it's small. There's no denying that. But for 1 person, I was ok being in the double room. While I was there, there was a couple with a baby trying to get a larger room. Turns out, they couldn't fit their luggage, their crib, and the stroller into the room. They eventually got a bigger room, but they still had to leave their stroller out in the hallway. My room was small, but adequate. I at least had the room to myself, a bathroom that I didn't have to share, and the AC worked which is very important during the muggy Spring season. The walls are a bit thin, so when people in neighboring rooms decided to party late into the night, you get to experience the fun, whether you wanted to or not. I was on the 2nd floor, and the tracks were right below. I had asked for the quietest room possible, but I ended up facing the tracks. No way my room was the quietest in the building. I could have asked to be switched, but I was too tired from my flight and I didn't want to cause problems, so I let it slide. But it turned out that the train didn't really bother me. I'm a very sound sleeper, and usually the day's events would tire me out so that I pretty much passed out. Also the trains stop running a little past midnight and don't start up again til early morning, so you get to sleep soundly through. Other points: The hotel is not very clean. You'll notice the discolored hallway rugs, the streaks on the walls, the old furniture, etc. There's a laundry room down in the basement/garage. It cost $3 AU to wash (30 min) and $3 AU to dry (60 min). There's a microwave downstairs in the dining area, but I think they put it away after the breakfast is over. Not really sure, but I don't remember seeing it after breakfast. Overall, I was satisfied with my stay at the hotel. I had a lot to do while I was there and I didn't want to stress over my lodgings. I got what I paid for, I was well rested, and I started the day with a full stomach. Would I stay there again? If I could find a hotel closer to downtown at a decent price, then I'd stay somewhere else. But if I'm on a tight budget and taking public transit, then I'd consider staying here again. It's really not that bad. Not that good either, but not bad. Honest. The front desk staff could use a refresher course on customer service though.

If you are on a tight budget and you've done your homework about the cost of travel, food, lodging etc in Sydney and Australia in general, you will appreciate this place highly for the price (If you haven't done your homework...believe me, it's expensive in Australia!!) You cannot really complain about anything due to how low, I paid just under $60 for a room for 2 and in Sydney, that is half+ less than most every place else. I don't know about you, but for myself, I don't spend a lot of time in my room...I use it for sleeping and prepping myself to get out there and suck in as much as I can...so I don't need anything fancy or frilly, just a place I can lay my head after spending all day on the go. It is near the rail station (within 5 minutes walking) and the tracks are right next to the Y, so if you don't like the sound of trains passing every so often, you wont like it here. The continental breakfast was a welcome thing, just what I needed: some cereal, coffee, juice and toast & jam. The staff were very friendly too. Take a trip up to the rooftop area and look around too! The location is not right in the heart of Sydney...in order to get to the Harbour you need to take the train....so if you like to be in the thick of things, this place is not for you either. To sum it all up: if you are the type that just needs a bed to rest your head after a long day of sightseeing, a free quick breakfast to revitalize, want to save a good chunk of dough for more important things and a bathroom and shower to prep for another long day....then definitely check this out. *and just to clarify, my ratings are based on what you get for the price of the room.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "new York", "Title": "\u201cNot my worst experience but would not recommend\u201d", "Author": "oxjohnnysangelxo", "ReviewID": "UR118104299", "Content": "Pros: Location is OK.

Wifi was a decent price - $25 for the week unlimited wifi and we didn't have any problems with that. Free breakfast (although it really is just toast/jam and cereals) Cons: Room was about the size of a prison cell. While in London I actually stayed in a hostel that was a former prison so I can tell you - this was about the same. My husband got sick while here and I'm convinced it was due to the dirtiness of the rooms. There was no ventilation in the room. TV was fuzzy with maybe 3 channels that worked a bit. Walls are thin as I could hear a baby crying at the other end of the hall. Bathroom is made for tiny people - shower was too short for both my husband and I (He is 6'2 and I'm 5'7). If you sit on the toilet you cannot stick your arms out so good luck grabbing the toilet paper. The free breakfast was OK however the staff always started putting things away earlier than scheduled. I got the impression that the staff is lazy - the cleaning person huffed once as we left our room and put the \"Please make-up room\" sign on the door. Most hotels the cleaning staff does several rounds until about 2 or 3pm to make sure they can clean as many rooms as possible. The reception person was never actually at the desk - you always had to push the bell to get them to stop playing their music in the back so they can come up and assist you. They aren't unpleasant, however do barely the minimum required of their jobs. And the fact that the breakfast staff cleans up too soon despite people trying to even just grab a cup of coffee or tea.

If you are going to see University of Sydney, it's about 10-15 minutes walk down the road. The catch of this hotel is its price, the free breakfast and location. Although to me, other hotels could have been in the better location than this. The breakfast is quite helpful, considering Sydney is quite an expensive place. Free flow of bread, jams, juice, milk and cereals, from 6/7 to 10 am. I often see people brought their breakfast to their rooms. The hotels has a lift, vending machine, computer terminals for rent, internet using pre-paid card, and free luggage room. In appearance, the hotel is good enough. It allows early check-in if the room is ready. It's very helpful for us, who just had a long journey from Melbourne on train which took around 9 hours. We chose a double room for 2 ppl, with queen size bed. The room is quite small and compact. It's really hard to move around if you have lots of luggage. The furniture is basic. It has a cupboard, corner table, hanging TV, AC, a chair, hairdryer, iron, coffee making facilities. The wall is not clean, with some dark marks on. Yet, it does not really bother us. The toilet is small, just enough because we are Asians. The cleanliness is medium. The shower is good, plenty of hot water. Complementary toiletries were available. The towels are clean enough. The bed sheet is also clean. The sound proofing is... medium. We can still hear the noise from outside, yet not so disturbing. Or probably because we were tired enough to care about it. And, at night, we can smell a funny smell like pesticide in the room. Not sure if it is deliberately provided or smell from outside. All in all, it's an okay hotel.

I was going out before my friend arrived so I asked to confirm the room and all was good. This was about 9am. The room at this time was already ready and the reception guy was really helpful. When we arrived later that night, we got into the room and immediately the blind cord snapped. I advised the reception (as I didn't want to be charged for breaking it) and they offered to change my room for me. We didn't bother as we were going out that night and would sleep through the morning light anyway! The laundry was good with a number of washers. The rooftop would be a fun place for a bit of a party! If you love trains, this is the place for you as it is next to the busy Redfern to Cental line.

A Go Gas station with a small asain take away is just down the road but other than that a 10min walk to broadway is probably the closest for food options.

But then again, my gf and I actually walked from Darling Harbour back to this hotel! Hahahaha...As for the interior of the hotel, well, it's clean and modern...they have a small but nice place downstairs for breakfast in the morning. And there is a microwave for us to heat up any food should you feel hungry in the middle of the night.

Breakfast was fine (cereal and toast) although basic, as would be expected for the price. For cheaper rates don't book directly through the hotel. The only down side was the location being next to a railway track (although soundproofing was fine and the trains were fairly infrequent at night). The rooms are quite small too. This hotel is also a good loction for the airport and mascot area. The roof terrace is useful for smokers and chill out.

The hotel's website says that the rooms are 'not overly large', which is true, however mine was easily large enough. The room was well equipped with everything I needed (en-suite and air conditioning were especially welcome) and was cleaned and tidied for me every day. My single gripe with this hotel was that the milk was left in a jug at room temperature in the dining area - I like cold milk for my corn flakes!
