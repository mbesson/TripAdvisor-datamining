The restaurants in Lido are reasonable and cheaper than the main island. beware of contori. They say no service charge then instead add 2 Euros ahead contori (cover charge...) a bit of a fiddle.

The room was on a small side (and since it was a twin room it can be considered a really small one). The good thing was that it had both a fan and air conditioner so it was a perfect shelter from the outside heat. However, it had 2 negatives about it - the windows that didn't let much daylight in (the classic case of room pictures you can find online being those of their best rooms and not necessarily matching the room you might get) and a TV with a really annoying stand-by light which was huge, very bright (so much so that it was never really dark in the room) flashing red and blue all night and impossible to turn off even if you unplugged the TV from the wall. The breakfast was pretty average but what I really loved was the possibility to have it in the garden which made for a perfect start of each day.

There are some excellent restaurants on the main street as well and all the gelato places are to die for. If you are diabetic like me - be warned. The food and pastries are coma inducing. The breakfast was excellent with fresh sliced meats, cheeses, rolls and pastries. As well as Italian coffee. We could pig out in the morning and then only need a light lunch (a tramezzino - sandwich). Then we could get a great meal in the evening. The two Andreas' that we dealt with were so helpful.

I initially picked it due to the favourable reviews on here, but the price was what made me finally book it. We booked through the hotel's own website and had a large ensuite double room for 3 nights for 70 Euro's per night. The Hotel is located around 200m from the Vaporetto stop. The boats travel from here all over the mainland Venice and to the surrounding islands. We never waited longer than about 8 minutes for a boat at any time. The hotel is on the Santa Maria Elizabetta road which is the main road from the Vaporetto stop to the beach. You can walk the entire length of the road in about 10 minutes. Our room was large, simply furnished with windows on either side. The views weren't especially inspiring, but not offensive and the room was lovely and light as a result of the 2 windows. The bed was large and comfortable with a firm mattress (which I prefer). The ensuite was large and the shower larger than many Italian showers that I have encountered before. There was even a bidet which came in handy for washing sandy feet! The room lacked 2 things. A mirror (there was only one in the bathroom) and a fridge. That aside, we weren't desperate for either. There was a very handy safe (free of charge) and the satellite TV had BBC world and CNN in English (not that we watched much television). The air conditioning was a welcome relief from the stifling heat and the overhead fan was great when getting to sleep. The rooms were spotless and we had absolutely no problems during our stay. The 2 members of staff that we encountered (both on reception) were friendly and helpful. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel (we had too much to do and too much sleep to catch up on!), but the rooms and garden that breakfast was served in looked lovely. There is a lift so anyone with heavy bags will have no problems. Our room was on the 2nd floor and was at the back of the hotel so we had no noise from the road. I would imagine that the rooms at the front may be a little noisier, but can't say for sure. We were in room 28. During our stay we travelled a lot over to Venice. We ate there many times, but also ate on the SM Elizabetta near to the hotel. There are several bars / restaurants which were still open at 2:00am. These serve pizza and snacks as well as drinks, ice-cream and cocktails. We found all of the local places that we ate and drank in to be fine and not as expensive as mainland Venice. I will review these places separately. The advice that I got here on tripadvisor was invaluable, especially the help with the travelling. It had been a long time since I was here last and I was Nervous about using public transport to get too and from the airport. When we arrived at Marco Polo airport (at 21:30 on a Friday) we bought our 72 hour ACTV tickets from the stand near to the exit. The passes were 33 euro's each. We caught the number 5 bus from the airport (remember to validate your ticket in the yellow box on the bus the first time that you use it). The trip to the Piazalle Roma took around 20 minutes. We then walked to the left and found the stands for the boats to the Lido. We caught the 51, but could have caught the number 1 too. The boat trip took around 35 minutes and we were in the hotel and out again with our first beer by 23:00! Here is some information on the prices of things that we bought. Drinks: My husband is not a wine drinker. We found that the beer prices were higher than home, but the quality of the beer was very good. The prices ranged from 3 euro's for half a litre up to 10 euro's for a litre of Nasto Azzurro or similar beer. Wine was around 5-8 euro's for half a litre. We didn't drink any cocktails, but the prices ranged around 5-7 euro's. We had some great drinks in the Campo San Margherita which was a great place for a spot of people watching. We ate a few times in Ferrovia which has great pizza and is generally cheaper than the other area's. We found some lovely bars in some non-touristy areas all over the island. We had a few hours on the beach and in the sea. The free beach is at the top of the SM Elizabetta road. We just took towels and lay on the sand. We had a swim too, but the sea isn't very clear. Ok for cooling off in. The Vaporetti run all night so you can stay really late in Venice and still get back for a nightcap on the Lido. When we come to Venice again, hopefully in not too long a time, we will definitely stay in the Hotel Cristallo and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for non-fancy, comfortable accommodation at an excellent rate.

We decided to take our youngest daughter who is 11 and so had to do the trip on a budget as there were three of us to pay for. We decided on this hotel as it has the best of both worlds: Venice only 10/15 mins by water bus and yet the family orientated lido with access to the beach. Hotel and Room - no frills and basic, yet extremely clean and comfortable. The mattresses and pillows were great. Our room was roomy for venice, on the third floor facing the main road and had a fan, air conditioning and double glazing to keep the noise out. The en-suite had obviously been recently reburbished to a high standard. All this for E110 a night for three people we thought was very good value for money. Also there is a Billa supermarket on the way to/from the water bus stop to the hotel which is great for getting supplies, wine etc. Breakfast - Really great plentiful continental breakfast with bread rolls, cheeses, meats, jams, pastries, cereals, orange juice, coffee which is frequently topped up by a very pleasant lady which is set in a nice ground floor room with access to a small garden. Staff - really pleasant and very helpful. Beach - about a 10 min walk with access to the hotel's beach hut to change in and some deck chairs and communal shower facilities. We used this for a couple of hours after a tiring few hours in Venice - perfect for relaxing. Hints and Tips Buy your transport cards from Venice Connect at a discount price. We collected ours at Piazzo Roma on arrival from Treviso airport by coach, but there are various places that the cards can be collected. Do try the Tourist Menus with 'service charge included' as they are really good value for money. We had two meals near to the railway station quarter as it is better value for money than the main areas - delicious two course meal, litre of wine, soft drink, bread rolls and including a tip E60 - E65 for three. Be warned - on our last day we had three basic pizzas, a beer, two soft drinks and was ripped off for E48 as there was a cover charge for the tablecloth, cutlery etc and service charge included - I would advise to check if service charge is included or there is a cover charge and how much a beer costs as we were charged E12!

There was a place in the garage for us, so we didn't have to worry about the car and all the Italiaan treasures we collected untill that time. The staffmember at the frontdesk was very informative. We had a nice room that was very clean. The bathroom was a little bit small, but everything we needed was there. The location of the hotel is good. In a couple of minutes walking there is the vaporetto. The waterbus brings you in about 15 minutes to town. We bought a 3 day card for 30 euro and could catch every boat we wanted. It was very nice to come back at the Lido after a day full of sightseeing in Venice. Tip. Don't stay to long at San Marco or Rialto. Make walkings trough the city, and you will find a quiet Venice without the crowds. Tip. Just have a look at the famous caf\u00c3\u00a9 Florian at San Marco. But do not buy an espresso on the terasse. We had to pay 22 euro for 2 espresso's, including the music!", "Date": "August 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holywood Co Down", "Title": "\u201cDecent enough hotel- but note....\u201d", "Author": "samrg", "ReviewID": "UR8206946", "Content": "Three of us including a teenager stayed at Cristallo for two nights and found previous reviews reasonably accurate. The accommodation, whilst no frills two star, was clean and roomy; the staff extremely helpful and the breakfast very good. However prospective guests should note the additional cost of ferrying back and forward to the mainland of Venice, unless of course you choose to stay out on the Lido. The vaporetti water buses are not cheap especially for a family. At our time of staying the water bus would have cost 36 Euro for a return trip for three from the Lido to say San Marco. There are 24 hour and 48 hour deals but still not cheap. There is something of a faded grandeur verging on seaside tackiness about the Lido itself though aspects of this may appeal to kids. If you really want to visit the beach then make use of Cristallo's private beach cabin, but note that the hotel itself is not adjacent to the sea.", "Date": "July 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "lancashire", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel, good location\u201d", "Author": "amandaksmith", "ReviewID": "UR7999484", "Content": "Booked with hotel itself having stayed here before, better prices and room a/v.

Lido is such a quaint and charming island. I had my concerns with the distance from Venice, but it's only an extra 10 minute boat ride to the Lido pier. The restaurants and pizzarias were excellent and very close to the hotel. Our room was very clean, spacious (considering European standards) and on a corner so we had three windows; it was lovely. We also had a newly renovated bathroom that was very nice. I cannot say enough about the hotel and its manager on duty (ANDRE) during our stay. He was extremely accommodating and was of particular assistance to us when we did not confirm our water taxi reservation to the airport early enough in the evening before we left Venice. He went out of his way to try to confirm our reservation after hours. To provide us some sense of comfort he mapped out an alternate public transportation route to get to the airport in plenty of time to make our flight. Fortunately our water taxi arrived as scheduled. I recommend stopping by Bar Maleti also on Gran Viale S. Maria Elisabetta. It has great food, drink, GELATO and internet service.
