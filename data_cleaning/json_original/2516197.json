They only offered valet at $27 per day. In many cases despite calling down 5-10 min in advance our vehicle was not ready when we came down. I think the valet were often overwhelmed with the volume.

We both noticed the nice soft water in the shower. Not sure if this is a trait of the Phoenix water system or just the hotel, but it was softer than our water at home even with a water softener in place. (Not something that we usually mention, but it was very noticeable!) One negative was that the room was fairly dark. The room was decorated using darker tones, and it seemed that we needed a little additional light to make it right. There was plenty of light in the bathroom/vanity area however. The flatscreen TV was huge, so maybe the lighting was done to optimize viewing of the screen...? The restaurant was wonderful.

The rooms were large, well-furnished and clean. The bathrooms were large as well. It's a very quite hotel. The location is outstanding with many restaurants nearby. The US Airways Center and Chase Field are only a few blocks away. The light rail stops right beside the hotel and it's a pretty quick trip to and from the airport. (I had to go back to the airport to pick up a rental car. We took a cab from the airport when we came in. I made it as quick on the light rail as the cab and it cost $1.75 as opposed to $30.) The hotel is very quiet and peaceful. The lobby is on the first floor and the next 10 are not part of the hotel. The meeting rooms and gym start on the 11th floor and the hotel rooms start on the 12th or 13th floor. The pool is pleasant (only 3 1/2 feet deep.) Our rooms had a small (empty) refrigerator which was convenient for us. I guess they all have them. Bottled water was free in the rooms as well as the gym. We didn't eat at the restaurant but it looked appealing. We did go to the bar and the service there was excellent. Parking is $27 a night but there is a nice, well-lit parking garage literally right across the street (between the Westin and the Hyatt) which charges $12 for a 24 hour period. The only complaints I have about the room (and they are very minor) is that the lighting is not good at night when looking for something in the closet and the alarm clock rather difficult to figure out.

Several things to note about this hotel. The hotel looks to be a part of a business building (I think the first 10 or so floors are business offices?). Also, not sure but this building may have been a complete office building before the top floors were converted to hotel rooms--each floor has a name that looks as if you are walking into a doctor's office. Also, one of the other downsides while I was visiting was that the pool had been rented out to a private party. Understandable that the hotel needs to make money, but it seems pretty presumptuous to close the pool on the weekend when that is one of the top amenities at the hotel. It wasn't a deal breaker for me, but I could see that a visiting family might be annoyed. Last but not least, the AC unit in the room does not seem to be adjustable. You can control the temperature range to a degree, but the unit appears to be permanently on.

The people, however, make it terrific. Originally, I think the building was supposed to be part of an office building. However, due to the changing commercial real estate market, it was decided to make the floors 11-18 into hotel and meeting rooms (I think the first 10 floors are the parking garage). Floors above 18 are predominantly used by the tenant whose name is on the top of the building, Freeport-McMoran. What this means for the traveler is that the rooms are huge, even by most luxury hotel standards. Add in the fact that it is still relatively new and you've got a physical plant that is both unique, inviting and comfortable (e.g. the Heavenly Bed). Not all rooms have tubs, so if this is important, you might double check with the hotel. However, the bathroom appointments are neat, clean and modern. Internet connection is excellent. Without exception, everyone I have met at this hotel (I have stayed about half dozen times) is friendly and truly seems to want to help make your stay a pleasant one. If you are able to get upgraded to the Westin Club Lounge (not all Westins have this feature), I would highly recommend it. Both Athena and Shaina are terrific hosts, not only knowledgeable about the area and the hotel, but focused on making sure you are comfortable using the Lounge. One final tip: Downtown Phoenix is about a 15 minute drive to the airport, so you can also use this hotel as an 'airport hotel' for those late night arrivals/early morning departures (PHX has no hotel on the premises).

The hotel is a short walk (about 10 min.) to the convention center and to the Arizona center which has several good restaurants and a Starbucks (not very good shopping though). I liked the short walk in the morning; however, if you're the type of person who likes to walk out the front door and have everything right there you might want to choose a different hotel. The location of the hotel was the only semi-negative for me. As I mentioned before, it is only a short walk, but you walk past a parking garage on one side and what looked like an empty run-down building on the other side on your way to the convention center & Arizona Center. I did see a couple of homeless people on that path, but this is a city, and they were not bothering anyone, so that didn't really bother me. During the day this was fine, but at night, as I was a women travelling alone and most of my colleagues stayed at one of the larger hotels directly across from the convention center, it did make me a little nervous to walk back to the hotel, but I just walked fast and stayed aware of my surroundings.

It is a class act upscale hotel with unique design details that shows Westin can still be a head turner and leader in hospitality in an all too often cost cutting world. Upon check in ...... I was welcomed with genuine appreciation as a 12 year Platinum elite member of Starwood Preferred Guest. The young team was filled with passion & smiles.

Hot dishes like eggs are frequently missing from most club lounges I visit. Freshly baked muffins,nice array of newspapers.All the basics are here If you don\u2019t have top elite status pay for the club. It\u2019s one of a handful of lounges that really is worth paying for access and you can get in and out when time matters. Only the evening spread was a yawn and not interesting. Not a big deal when you are about to hit the town for dinner anyway shorty after \u2022 The Legendary Heavenly bed and its nice linens. \u2022 A really good restaurant called Province that\u2019s rising but not fully there yet. The talent is clearly there and I would be delighted to return Yes there were some misses on the menu and local reviews reflect that as well. However there were also some big hits. My stand out dish was the grilled salmon. Look at the seafood items here which appear to be standouts Beautiful fresh fish cooked very nicely. Delicious Brussel sprouts magnificently prepared and a lovely heartfelt team. Not all seasoned or polished but making the effort. \u2022 The health club was adequate and very attractive. Being more serious about my fitness routine I paid to use Gold\u2019s Gym nearby as like most hotel health clubs it just misses the mark with the fitness equipment options unless you after primarily cardio equipment which it has all the basics required. I have moved to Hyatt and other brands in recent years as Starwood and its program has been in some sort of minor decline. Some of their hotels lost appreciation and recognition of its frequent customers. This is a hotel where there is no penny pinching team members are happy to be there and guest are enjoying their stay and being productive Elite members are cared for as is all guests. How good is the Westin Phoenix? I recently stayed at a Starwood luxury collection hotel at 4 x the price and it was inferior in every way. The Westin Phoenix ranks amongst my best hotel stays of 2011 out of 200 plus nights on the year on the road. The only thing I dislike about the hotel is the horrible floral stinky putrid scent in the lobby that Starwood and select other hotel companies pump through their ventilation systems. Some obviously like it. Unfortunately this is Starwood corporate decision to perfume their hotel lobbies so I do not fault the hotel in anyway. Thankfully it is odor free in hallways and the hotels well kept state of the art guest rooms. None the less I thank the management and team of this hotel for a great stay helping me to remember why I like Starwood Hotels and the SPG program all over again. You are my new go to hotel anytime in Phoenix My congratulations to Starwood and SPG they got this one right!!! The Westin Phoenix delivers on the brand promise.Hopefully that never changes More Westins like this Starwood!", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cWestin for New Year's Eve\u201d", "Author": "AnnaAZ", "ReviewID": "UR123270929", "Content": "We stayed at the Westin New Year\u2019s Eve as it was within walking distance to the Orpheum Theater where we were attending a concert.

She asked if we needed dinner arrangements and offered to assist with reservations or suggestions. Once she found that we were attending the concert she offered directions or any other additional information. The room was much nicer and larger than we had anticipated. The floor-to-ceiling windows were stunning and we enjoyed the view watching the sunset. The extended ceiling height also adds greatly to the room along with a well appointed bathroom and terrific shower. There was enough room for both of us to move around and get ready for the evening without a problem with an extremely comfortable bed, additional seating area and ample work desk.

After much research of the Phoenix area, I discovered the Westin had opened and made reservations on their website and found an incredible deal. From the moment we drove up to the hotel to the time we left, we were treated like royalty. The service was impeccable. The guys at the valet parking had our car brought out front as soon as we needed it and always were helpful in giving directions to various places around the city. On the first day that we arrived the bellman that delivered our luggage to our room made us feel right at home. I believe his name was Ricardo. He shared all about the hotel as well as the amenities of our room. The rooms at the Westin are amazing. They are huge and have a great floor to ceiling window overlooking the city of Phoenix. One night we were able to see the fireworks from Chase Field. Another great experience at the hotel was the club level. We paid an additional $30 a day and was able to have breakfast, snacks during the day, different selections of of food in the early evening and desserts after 7 PM. Those that attended the club level were terrific. If you are going to Phoenix, AZ for any reason, be it business or vacation, you need to stay at this hotel. Take my word for it.

I checked in and was advised that because of my frequency status I had been upgraded. I had been careful to book a room with a full bath since I knew that most of their rooms only have 3/4 baths. My room description had said double vanity which I had had previously so I knew It was probably like my last room. The upgraded room only had a single vanity making me question the \"upgrade\". I ordered dinner and specifically asked for a cart not a tray, so I could sit and watch Television. The meal arrived on a tray but the very helpful attendant quickly corected that but when he removed the cover we realized it wasn't what I had ordered. I decided to forgo dinner. As I prepared for bed I tried to close the blackouts but they wouldn't come together. I called and a maintenance man was immediately sent and tried to repair the problem, but we both came to the conclusion that it waas not fixable as it was a design flaw. I thought I could live with it and decided to try to sleep through it. Unfortunaltey the ray of light split the bed right in half and caused a fitful night of sleep. On my way out at 6:45am the next morning I asked for an emailed copy of my bill which I was assured would be sent. A week later no bill had been received. I phoned and someone assured me they would send me a copy. Two more weeks went by and I sent a comment to SPG asking for a copy of the bill. I received a canned response assuring me I would receive a copy of the bill. A week after receiving thiis I copied and pasted the response in another comment asking again for a copy of the bill. Another canned response saying I would receive a copy. It has been a week and still no copy received from anyone.

The thing blows in every room 24/7. That's insane. So you have generally cold air blowing on your face all night long. Not fun. and doesn't exactly make for restful sleep. The restaurant is horrible. The food is well below average and quite expensive. We had breakfast and it was barely edible. The pool deck is closed and not slated for opening for several more months. The stairwell is locked from the inside, so if you get in, you can't get out anywhere but the bottom floor but there's no notice of that. They try to not make up the room or bring you towels unless you specifically ask for clean towels. On the good side, the staff is polite and generally helpful. They try hard to rectify the myriad problems, but ultimately there's only so much they can do. the gym is well maintained and the free bottled water is a nice touch.
