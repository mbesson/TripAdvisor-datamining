We arrived early at noon and asked if we could drop our bags until we could checkin, and they said that they would make the room up for us so we could tidy up after train ride and while we were waiting they offered a cappucino. Just incredible. We stayed in Rome 107 that opens to the roof terrace and it was wonderful. Although the roof terrace is open to all in the hotel, we did not feel our privacy was sacraficed. The other rooms that open to terrace are 104 and 106. The room was very clean, big enough for our bags and a little desk for our laptop and free WiFi. The bed is very firm which was alright with us. Small bath with very small shower, but for value and location this hotel cannot be beat. It is just a very short walk to Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Partheon and Piazza Navona. Lots of restaurants everywhere within a few blocks. Breakfast is included: big basket of croissants, rolls and breads with jam, cereals, yogurt and cheese and any tea or type of coffee you would want.

We spent around 180 bucks a night on the place and for the area, it was unbeatable. As per other reviews the rooms are small, but when traveling in Europe you need to have the right expectations. This also is not a luxury hotel, it is a clean, afforable option in an awesome location. In almost all places you will have smaller rooms than you are used to. Overall though the hotel was very clean and the staff very helpful and friendly. The Pantheon, Trevi fountain, Piazza Navona, and Spanish steps are all in between 5 to 10 minute walks. There are 2 metros nearby: one at Barberini and the other at Spanish steps. We used them to a few times, one to get to the Vatican, once for the Coliseum, then on our trip out to get to Termini with luggage. You can walk anywhere from this hotel, just be prepared as the coliseum is probably a 25 min walk and the Vatican even longer. In our trip we walked pretty much everywhere, but sometimes you need to choose your battles and save your feet for the rest of the day. As for restaurants in the area, be careful as it is near may tourist sites and we found those we stumbled upon when we were tired and hungry were bad, and those we carefully researched were very good. The hotel has a rooftop terrace and a few rooms that open up to it. We stayed in one of those rooms and it was really nice to have easy access to the deck, which we hung out and drank wine on, so ask and see if one of those is available. Unfortunately during our stay the Piazza that the roofdeck overlooks was under construction, which hopefully is done by now. The best tip I have for a stay in Rome is to make use of the many fountains over Rome called nasoni (they are marked SPQR), which constantly have cold delicious and most importantly free water. There is one of these located in the piazza right by the hotel and we filled up our water bottles each morning and night. Breakfast is included with your stay as well and it's pretty basic, which was common with hotels in Italy though I'd say this hotel had a little less than other places we stayed. Breakfast had croissants, fruit, yogurt and other basics, just load up on some carbs and get your day started early. My last recommendation would be to check out a website called Reid's Italy if you are planning your trip on your own and really want to try and make the most of it and maximize what you see, or even just get down the important places to see. He has advice on top sights, hotels and places to eat.

It is not the fanciest, it is not the largest, not the most luxurious hotel we have ever stayed in, but it was perfect for our time there. The location is the best, the metro stop drops you off right in front of the Spanish Steps and you walk through the main shopping district and the hotel is tucked in a side street right off from all the shopping streets. (Side Note: take a bus from the airport, pass by everyone offering you shuttles and taxis and buses, they will rip you off, just follow signs for the buses outside of the airport, they will sell you tickets in front of the bus and it goes directly to the main train station. We bought ours for 8 euros per person and it included a return ticket on the bus). The hotel has an extremely small elevator, we traveled with friends that had a small baby and only one person could go in with the stroller, or two or three adults with no luggage. On arrival we had to take the elevator 4 times to get everything upstairs. (There is the option of taking the stairs as well up about 3-4 flights). The staff was extremely nice, everyone spoke English, they were all more then willing to help us with directions and offered us maps as soon as we walked in. They also sell water bottles and drinks for very reasonable prices, which was nice because we were able to carry those bottles around with us the whole time and refill them throughout the city using the public drinking fountains. We had requested one room attached to the roof top terrace and a second room on the main floor for our friends who had a baby with them. We were able to share the terrace with our friends, who also noted that our room attached to the terrace was nicer then theirs downstairs. It was also extremely convenient that the hotel included breakfast, this was not a deal breaker for us when planning our trip, but it turned out to be a huge help in the mornings to have a good breakfast waiting for us. It was no bacon and eggs, but they had a small table with cereal choices, fresh breads and croissants every morning, fruit, juices, and they would make you as many cappuccino's as you wanted.

We were glad to have a Superior room though with air conditioning and double glazing as this meant our room was a good size, cool and quiet.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Johannesburg, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cVery good, great location\u201d", "Author": "Rikulia", "ReviewID": "UR118385188", "Content": "We have spend 4 night in this hotel last week so my memories are still fresh:) As the 2 star hotel it is really amazing!

From this fantastic location, we walked everywhere. No need for buses, cabs or subways. The major walking route is Via Del Corso, always packed with people, so it felt safe to walk to the hotel at anytime of day or night. Although it might sound nice (at first) to select some hotel on a quaint crooked street, I would pick the Hotel Parlamento in the busy shopping area again in a heartbeat. The best nearby site is the Pantheon, where a local sings opera every night (magical!). Don't miss the Museo Borghese and the Park. Hotel Parlamento will happily phone in a reservation for Borghese the day before you wan to go. Easy! We drank wine on the Parlamento terrace at 6:30 pm every evening.

Just half a block away is a bus station, at piazza San Silvestro. Around the corner from the bus station is a grocery store where we picked up snacks and wine. The hotel has a tiny elevator, so it can take a little time to get people up/down with their luggage. The elevator goes to the 3rd floor and then you have one flight of stairs to the hotel lobby. Next to the lobby/check-in area is a small breakfast room. Our room (#94), one flight up from the lobby level, had a view of the inner courtyard. It was very quiet at night, so I didn\u2019t mind the lack of views. The room was small and a tight fit with our luggage, but we arranged the room so that we could walk around. Twin beds, on the soft side, were comfortable. Lighting was poor but I wasn\u2019t surprised. Most hotels I\u2019ve stayed in while in Europe seem to use low wattage. The room had a flat screen tv., a small table, and end tables next to the beds. The bathroom was a good size with a large counter top space. Lighting could be better but we had a window for light and fresh air. Small shower and bidet. Also on our floor is a doorway to the rooftop terrace. Some of the rooms have direct access to the terrace and pricier than that we paid for our room. This was one area we used during the late afternoon or evenings, enjoying a glass of wine or two, or to simply sit and write in my journal. What I loved the most about Hotel Parlamento was the staff. Everyone was friendly and helpful. One evening the owner, Mr. Chini, treated my cruise friends and me (about a dozen of us) to some red wine and snacks on the terrace. I thought this was a wonderful gesture. The place isn\u2019t fancy but it\u2019s a comfortable place to stay, it\u2019s in a great location and has the best service I\u2019ve found in a long time in my travels.

The breakfast is adequate ---- coffee drinks and tea, juice, fruit, cereal, rolls, biscuits and cheese. If you prefer other offerings, there are cafeterias and restaurants close by. They do have Internet, but charge for it. Many attractions are just a short walk away -- the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, Piazza Navona and the aforementioned Spanish Steps. (As for airport connections, they will gladly arrange transport to Fiumicino Airport, but it's cheaper -- and more reliable, what with traffic being so unpredictable -- to take the subway to the main train station and get the Leonardo Express.)

It was not a handheld shower and because the shower stall was about 30 inches by 30 inches, when the shower was on, it filled the whole shower stall.

I originally found it listed in an issue of National Geo Traveler in the early 2000's when they did an article called \"The Top 10 hotels in Rome for under $135 a night\" and I just kept coming back. It's mostly a family-run pensione, and if you stay for a few days you'll get to know everyone that works the desk. I feel like they've become real-life friends over my many stays there, and part of the fun of returning to Rome time after time is knowing that I have people to re-connect with when I'm there. The last couple visits, I went with my partner... since we're both guys, I wasn't sure what the reaction would be upon our arrival -- we've experienced some unpleasantness from hotels in the past, based on peoples' personal discriminatory attitudes -- but just as I expected, they greeted him with open arms. They're good people, and they're truly a class act. About the hotel itself: the construction is finished, and the lift has been extended so it reaches all the way to the ground floor. But honestly, I've thought some of the past reviews were absolutely silly for mentioning that you had to walk up a half-flight of stairs to get to the lift, or that they were bothered by the construction, when no noise ever reached the hotel and no construction ever blocked entry. I never understood why some of the reviewers got so bothered by these things, when they hardly impeded your travel or your access to the hotel. But alas, I guess some people are just hard to please. The rooms aren't the sprawling, suite-like Holiday Inn-type rooms that many Americans are used to, they're European-sized, which means that they're on the smaller side. They're very clean, have air conditioning (if you request it), and the bathrooms are all new & marble. One of the best features of this hotel is its location: it sits right at Piazza San Silvestro, which is practically \"dead center\" of the city of Rome, and especially to the areas that you'll want to be exploring. San Silvestro is also the hub for all of the buses, and there is a taxi stand there as well. You are 10 short minutes' walk to the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps, Piazza del Popolo; all of the shops that line the Corso and the very inviting sidestreets are at your feet, including the Galleria di Alberto Sordi, which is something like a mall containing a handful of stores in a gorgeous old building. So if your day should get rained out, you have plenty of indoor options (including the Doria Pamphilj museum) very close by. And at the end of the day, you can sit on the hotel's rooftop terrace with a glass of wine, and take in the sights below you: the buzz from the Corso, the people strolling through Piazza San Silvestro... it's a lovely way to unwind. You can also take your breakfast up there, AND there are 2 or 3 rooms that open right onto the terrace as well. We stayed in 104 which was very cute, and we loved being able to open the doors right onto the terrace! If you need help with reservations or scheduling, they'll happily help you. And if you're a seasoned traveler and you want some inside tips -- places off the beaten path, non-touristy areas, neighborhoods that are great for walking or exploring, or even just a place to take in a romantic walk and a sunset -- these are the guys to ask! I've sent about 10 different friends to Parlamento over the last few years -- a single friend, a family of 4, another gay couple, a group of girlfriends traveling together -- and they've all loved Hotel Parlamento and thanked me profusely for recommending it. A hotel in this location normally runs a gazillion dollars a night, and this is part of the reason why Parlamento is such a great find: it's reasonably priced, and it's a lovely little hotel. I'd suggest taking a look at the other reviewers' posted photos if you want to get an idea of what the rooms look like. They're furnished very simply and with some antiques, and I believe that all of the rooms have now been updated to include flat-screen TVs (ours had one). Also, extra bonus: the hotel now has wi-fi! If you don't have a laptop, they also have a computer in the lobby/breakfast area. You need to buy a card w/a password to access the wi-fi (10E for 6 hours of 5E for 2 hours) -- not because the hotel is greedy or anything, but because of the Internet protection laws in Italy, which seem to be quite strict. So alas, no free wi-fi... but certainly not through any fault of theirs! And if you're a traveler who's new to Rome, can I make one recommendation? Take the winding sidestreets, let yourself get a little bit lost, and enjoy the experience. See more of the city than just the Vatican and the Coliseum: go to Trastevere & other neighborhoods and wander the ancient streets, and take some time to soak up what this city is all about. Spend an hour lingering over a cup of coffee or a cocktail, and people-watch. Take in the morning market at Campo de'Fiore or at Bar Farnese. Find an out-of-the-way hole-in-the-wall restaurant on a crowd-free sidestreet and enjoy a quiet dinner. Take a late-night walk down quiet cobblestoned streets. Rome is a beautiful place with a lot to discover: and Parlamento is a great home-base to have while you explore it. They are like my Roman cousins, and I adore them, which is why I keep going back time after time. Thanks Plinio, Andrea, Tiziano, Roberto & Angelica for another lovely stay.

Taxi pick up at Rome Fiumcino Airport (Rome Shuttle) - didn't show. Picked up white taxi at the airport at 2130 for cost of 45 euros. Not necessary to book next time. Hotel Parlamento (2 star) is situated right in the centre of Rome equi-distant from Trevi, Spanish Steps, Pantheon. The Bus Station on the square , designer shops and Parliaament buildings and Post Office are just adjacent. Wise to book room 106 which has french windows to the roof terrace outside your room.. Breakfast on the terrace at no extra charge is OK but not great. Rooms have TV, safe, clean and even a jacuzzi type bath - room bit faded but clean. The staff are courteous, helpful and will help with maps, transport, advice and shopping. This part of Rome is totally safe and secure, day and night, suited politicians and smart businesspeople abound. Lots of inexpensive eating places are very close and the Pizza Restaurant (turn left as you come out of the hotel) up the street to has the traditional open fire oven. The famous ice cream parlour , about 100/150 yards up from the trevi, that's with the trevi on your left straight up the street facing you and take the first left, it's tiny, no seats BUT ICE CREAM TO DIE FOR. Try to see the Trevi at night. Went to the flower market which was just two or three stalls selling flowers but the other stalls were interesting, selling fruit and veg, cheese and some tat. Not really worth a detour. The round-Rome open deck bus is excellent value, you can get off and on when you like and takes in all the sites. Must not miss the Sistine Chapel and the Vatican and the Bergaze Museum which you have to book a slot in advance - the hotel will do that for you but the tip is to book in advance of you getting to Rome. The Pantheon is astonishing and need to walk there. Another tip, the hotel is nearly always booked up so you need to book well in advance, before you book your flight cos it is very popular - partly the price and the location. There is a lift at the hotel but it does not go the whole way, there is a small flight of stairs before you reach the reception.", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cWarm and Welcoming plus Location\u201d", "Author": "JerseyGirl52", "ReviewID": "UR46629071", "Content": "Our stay at the Hotel Parlamento was one of the highlights of our vacation in Italy.

We also used the Parlamento's airport transportation service for 55 EURO. Not so bad when a cab from the airport would be 50 EURO. From the moment we arrived, we felt like we were treasured guests in someone's house. While the Parlamento is certainly not the most glamorous hotel that you will ever find, you feel welcome every minute that you are there.

Rooms - Ample. The only two complaints I'd have was that we could not get the in-room television to work, even with the intervention of Angelica (not the worst thing that can happen on a vacation) and the room suffered from a lack of cabinet space for clothes which we would have liked to unpack a little bit more. Still, a comfortable bed, a quiet room, as requested, and really, it's just a place to take a late afternoon nap and sleep at night. Other features - Breakfast was more than sufficient... grapefruit and orange juice, espresso, american coffee, or cappucino, a variety of cereals, and a variety of cold breads with different spreads. Trust me, you don't want a huge and heavy hot breakfast before a long day of walking. The rooftop garden was a superb way to take an afternoon off from sightseeing... bask in the warm Italian sun, listen to the sounds of Rome, read a book, and sip from a bottle of Chianti.

We thought it was a great value. Service, whether breakfast or housekeeping, was delivered with enthusiasm. The rooftop terrace is a wonderful place to have a cup of their delicious capuccino or enjoy a glass of wine, and take in the energy and magnificence of Rome. The \"icing on the cake\" came immediately after we left Rome for the Amalfi Coast. We had a little train \"adventure\" and could not reach our pre-arranged driver or upcoming hotel by cell phone, to make alternative arrangements.

All of the staff were very friendly. My only complaint would be that the breakfast left a lot to be desired. Lastly, the location was fantastic! We only had 2 days to spend in Rome, so having such a convenient location was really helpful. You're right by the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps (the steps are very underwhelming by the way, especially with current construction). And the hotel is also right by a major Piazza from which the majority of city buses and taxis leave from. Very handy.

Encouraged by other reviews, we booked at the Parlamento. We found it to be an unpretentious hotel with limited facilities - in keeping with its small size (23 rooms). It has, however, several positive attributes that are worth emphasising. First, its location. It is within easy walking distance of the Spanish Steps, the Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon, and a 20 minute walk will take you to the Forum and the Colloseum. Second, the Chini family who run the hotel are friendly and helpful, and all speak good English. Third, the charges are modest. We paid 160 euros per night (inclusive of breakfast) for an adequately sized room with a well-appointed bathroom. Breakfast is a simple affair - cereals, rolls, croissants, coffee or tea - but quite sufficient unless you feel that eggs and bacon or cold meats are a necessary start to the day, in which case you will have to eat out! While the breakfast area is small, you can take it on the roof-top terrace (as we did) or in the privacy of your room. Inevitably there are a few draw-backs. The hotel's central location on a busy street means that it is noisy. The double windows have to be closed at night, and if the weather is hot you will need to have air-conditioning for which an additional charge is levied (12 euros per night). Furthermore, the hotel is on the 3rd and 4th floors of an ancient building; there is a miniscule lift, but you stll have to climb a short flight of stairs to reach Reception. Mind you, if you cannot negotiate a few stairs I would advise that you take a holiday in Rome off your itinerary!

A hotel is more than the rooms, location & amenities. It is the people who run the show and set the tone for the guests. These guys (and gal) were just super - helped us feel comfortable visiting \"their\" city for the first time, and when we hit a snag, helped us rearrange our week to meet our needs, including securing a room at another hotel for the one night that they simply could not accommodate us. As owner/operators, they were genuinely interested in making our stay and our entire experience the best it could be. Details re: the hotel itself - there are several steps/stairs to get to the hotel lobby, and then to the rooms, which could be a challenge for someone with limited mobility, but really, Rome as a whole is not very \"accessible\" so I wouldn't think this would be an issue for most people. We found breakfast to be very fine, including three types of breakfast cereal with milk to supplement a more typical European continental breakfast selection. There is a supermarket one block away for a broad selection of fruit, picnic lunch provisions, food & drinks for afternoon snacks on the lovely roof patio, etc. This is not a \"5-star\" hotel - there is no room service, you cannot independently adjust the heat/air, bathrooms & showers are small. The rooms are each different and typically small by American standards, but we had plenty of space for 3 in our room. Some street noise should be expected when staying right in the center of everything, I actually think the windows were more sound-tight than most in a hotel of this type. What else to say? We felt Hotel Parlamento was an excellent value - not the cheapest place we could find, nor the most luxurious, but met our needs and exceeded our expectations. We had several lengthy conversations with a few of the staff, discussing politics (Italian & American), tourism, and food. To say they speak English well is an understatement - we speak no Italian!

It is worth noting that I don't speak Italian but my friend does. They were much friendlier and more talkative with her (having conversations with her in Italian and providing additional insight about Rome, which was a nice, added bonus for us because I'm not sure we would've been privy to such great insight had we been English-only speakers). The hotel occupies the top two floors of a building in central Rome. You need to climb one set of stairs to get to the elevator (which will take you up the equivalent of four flights of stairs). Once you get off the elevator, you will need to climb one more set of stairs to get to the front entrance of the hotel. The elevators are small--it can comfortably fit two average-sized people, three at most--without luggage. We are in good physical shape, so climbing the stairs is not a problem for us. However, if you have limited mobility, it may be tricky for you to reach the hotel entrance. It is in an excellent location! You can walk to just about anything in central Rome from this location. Additionally, the major bus stops are less than a hundred meters away if you need to take it anywhere (convenient for us when we went to Villa Borghese and Termini Station). The rooms are basic but clean. They installed double windows so most of the street noise is blocked out (the hotel is smack dab in the middle of the city--lots of noise all around--so the double windows did a great job). However, the doors leading to the hallway don't provide as much of a sound barrier. We could hear our neighbors coming and going...and staying....standing in front of our doors. A small safe is provided, which I appreciated. The room offered adequate space; bathroom was spacious but our shower stall was small by US standards--not uncommon in my experience in European cities, though.

At the present time, there are outside renovations going on, but do not let that detract you from staying here during the renovation. This is truly the best spot to walk to almost every monument in the historic center, without ruining your budget.

Everyone speaks English and will be only too happy to help you to get around Rome and see the sights of their beautiful city.

There's a nice little roof top terrace, the staff are quite friendly (especially the two younger desk clerks) and the rooms are well-appointed if a bit small. They also seemed at pains to include some luxury hotel niceties -- like a Jacuzzi shower -- these things were pretty unnecessary, but I could see that they were really striving to shake off their pensione roots and become a real hotel. The first problem is that the hotel's building is undergoing major renovation so the outside is in shambles and there's scaffolding and construction materials everywhere (including around the otherwise lovely rooftop terrace). The hotel clerk we talked to said that the construction company swears they'll be done in two months \u2013 but apparently that's what they said back in March, too. Aside from the noise and the mess, this was also problematic because we couldn't open one set of our windows because of the scaffolding and since the rooms don't come with AC this was problematic in hot and humid Rome. Breakfast was another downer. They serve coffee American style (e.g., brewed in an industrial machine) \u2013 think stale truck stop coffee. It was wretched -- and what greater sin is there than to drink bad coffee in Rome? Fortunately, the two great coffee temples of Rome, Caffe Sant'Eustachio and La Tazza D'Oro are just a few minutes away so skip breakfast at the hotel and stand at the bar with the Romans. Finally, the hotel seemed a bit overpriced for what it is.

To get to hotel itself, you go through a courtyard and up 2 flights of stairs to lift. We stayed in a double room off the roof courtyard. The room itself is of adequate size and the bathroom was modern, clean and I didnt find it too small (we had a bath). The roof courtyard is a great bonus as is great spot for having the breakfast in the morning (croissants, rolls, superb coffee) and for chilling in evening before dinner. The courtyard is open to all staying at the hotel and not just those staying in courtyard rooms. During our stay they were repainting the building and re-doing the roof. I have to honestly say it didnt effect our stay except for one afternoon when we couldnt get out onto the courtyard as they were painting. Aircon costs extra and was needed as the weather was a hot 28-31C and humid. Overall I would recommend this hotel, is great value and in a great location minutes from Spanish Steps and Trevi.

They loved the place and found it quit cozy and perfectly suited for our needs. The staff again was great providing us with airport pickup (and delivery). Even though we had arranged a tour online to Assisi prior to arriving, they made sure the connections were made and all went well. July 23, 2006, my Brother took his family to Rome while he had a business meeting. Paralmento was my recommendation to them until they could check into the much more expensive and five star hotel provided by the business. Their stay was so good at the Parlamento that he called from the airport on his way home to tell me that the Parlamento was right on the money for the place to stay. His family all enjoyed their stay and loved the service and attention of the staff. Their room off of the elevator brought no complaints.

The owner of Hotel Parlamento met us at the entrance asking how much did we pay. When we told him, he chased the taxi away yelling thief!! We should have paid about 30-40 euro!

The rooms were immaculate. The bedding very clean and comfortable. The staff always available, knowledgeable and friendly. They made dinner reservations for us and called for legal taxis. Breakfast was pleasant, just enough to get you out the door; coffee, biscotti, croissants, jam, juice & coffee. The rooms were small , but I don't think you are there to stay in the room. The location was awesome. We walked everywhere, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, and the Coliseum. We took a taxi to the Vatican to meet a tour guide we met earlier at the Coliseum. He was British and his name was Tony. He is a professional archeologist and is a wealth of history! We ate at Hard Rock cafe. HR Rome has the best memoribilia (John Lennon, Tom Petty, Madonna, Wham, U2, Springsteen, much much more than most HRs) We also ate at a restaurant Cisterna (across the river).

It was our first stop on a 3-week trip, so we arrived pretty exhausted after a long flight from California. Let me preface my comments by saying that we like family-run, budget hotels and between Frommer's and Rick Steve have always been happy with the accommodations we have booked. Hotel Parlamento was our first HUGE disappointment! Although it is a great location and reasonably priced, I would have gladly paid more for a more positive experience. We were given room #74 which is right off the reception area, so we could not get any rest because of all the noise both day and night. Late into the night the door buzzer would ring and all day long people were checking in and out. We immediately asked for a different room, but were told by \"Tiziano\" that he would have to check the next day. We paid extra for air-conditioning as it was very hot in Rome. That night, the air conditioning didn't work, so we had to sleep with the window open, creating even more noise from the traffic on Via del Corso. Also, there was no hot water for showers. The next morning, \"Tiziano\" told me that I had broken the air-conditioner by hitting a wrong button on the remote control. He had a very arrogant attitude, but he did tell us to pack up our bags and they would move them to a new room while we went off to tour the Borghese Gallery. Later that afternoon, when we arrived back at the hotel hot and tired, they still had us in room 74 and said there were no other rooms available. They told us that they had fixed the air-conditioner...that the motor had burned out. If we were not so exhausted, we would have looked for another hotel. The next afternoon, we came back to the hotel to find a very rude and grumpy older gentleman at the desk. I politely asked him for our room key and he yelled at me and said we had clogged the toilet and accused us of putting things down it! How mortifying! The toilet had worked perfectly when we had left that morning. The only bright spot of our stay was Andrea, who had to be at the desk all night. He was so charming and humble and did all he could to help us fix the air-conditioner at 2am. After 3 nights, we moved to a wonderful hotel further east, but still a great location...Hotel Nardizi...what a difference...the staff was delightful...the rooms were beautiful and quiet. Please, think twice before you book at Hotel Parlamento. We try to be humble, polite guests when we travel, but the arrogant attitudes at Hotel Parlamento would anger and demoralize even the most humble traveler.

Fortunately, since we were arriving at night, we had them send someone to pick us up at the airport. That was 50 euros well spent. The airport is way out of town, and there was construction on the highway. Took us over an hour to get in, but the driver was waiting for us (flight was delayed), and had a lovely new car. The hotel is in a fabulous, central location. We walked everywhere - including the Vatican (about 45 minutes).But the building is being renovated (probably through December, we were told). There is scaffolding around the outside and only a small sign on a pillar in front with the name of the hotel. At night, you buzz to get in. I don't think we would have found it if we had been on our own at night.The entry (also under renovation) goes to the main building, and the hotel entrance is through a courtyard (yup, being done) to the right. There is another hotel entrance to the left. Once you go through the courtyard (which is only open at the top of where the buildings meet, so is very dark), you have two flights of stairs, then a very small elevator (one person, two suitcases), then another flight of stairs. A little daunting. However.... Our room was quite comfortable with private bath. Shower is indeed small, but more a problem of getting in and out because it was located next to a cabinet. The stairs and the size of the shower would only preclude someone of \"size\" from enjoying the hotel. The room we were given opened to the rooftop (more construction), but there was access to the tables and chairs. Since this was early March, it was damp and chilly, and we really didn't use it. In another season, I'm sure it would be great. Bed was comfortable, towels were just fine (we had been warned they would be very small, but weren't.) Breakfast was downstairs, with the best capuccino(made to order) we had on our 3-week trip. Croissants, canned fruit, other crackers and things. Just fine to get your day started. Hotel staff was very helpful. Someone was there at all times. Even helped us ship \"dress-up\" clothes to Monaco for a family party we were going to attend in two weeks and didn't want to drag extra stuff around. We paid 125 euros a night (and stayed for 6 nights), and I looked for a lot of places.
