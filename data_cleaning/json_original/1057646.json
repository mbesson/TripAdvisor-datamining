It is very close to Garen Via tube metro station, and there are few good restaurants too very close by the hotel, that to pure Spanish restaurants. Hotel is located in a usual small street ( real Spanish way), you might be a bit surprised when very first time you enter into the street, coz' lot of ladies are waiting to welcome you and at your service. Just relax it is just a \"Hi - How are you\" chat, and they are not gonna disturb you. With all those sweet 'n warm welcome in the street, what is next? you think about a Spanish receptionist struggling to welcome you!!!!.. My friend then you are wrong, you will be welcomed with a great and more sweet smile that you already received from the street :) and the best part is they are very good with their english, and explain you each and every thing that you need. No what about the rooms? one the best that i have seen for this price. very clean, well maintained, personal locker, bathrooms are really spacious good shower, clean bath towels. you have small balcony opening to the street, enough to keep just 2 chairs. 2 layers of curtains to have flexibility of privacy and light as much as you want. Good wifi connection too. Even the pathways are really well decorated, and clean. It is really a good service for the money that you are paying for a hostal facility. you can't expect more privacy with respect to the noise in the next room or corridor. Excellent customer service, why this specific statement is we went out to have lunch just after check-in before going out we asked receptionist for some information, she said she will help me regarding with that once am back ( because we were starving ), and when we were back there was a change in the shift and another person was there in the reception, the best part is first receptionist had clearly given instruction/ information to the new person about it, and there was no need me explaining her what was the issue.

The staff at the hostal are friendly and helped us with some directions when we needed it. The Wifi was good enough for our usage and they provided free printers, if we needed to print anything. The ensuite was perfect with an excellent shower. The rooms were cleaned on a daily basis as well. The location is a bit sketchy as you will see a few women hanging around the area - but they never bothered us nor did we feel unsafe at any point in the trip.

We got the metro from the airport to the hotel with no bother whatsoever. It is less than a three minute walk from Gran Via metro station. If you plan what changes you need to make on the metro and have a little look at google street view so you know where to turn off Gran Via you are golden (next to H&M works well!). No need to pay the 35 Euro for a taxi. A hotel shuttle also calls at Ballesta for the return trip to the airport, but we would have to have got up really early to get it, so didn't bother!

Some of the reviews commented on the \"ladies of the night\" and yes they are working the street outside the hotel but they never bothered us as we entered or left the hotel. Other reviews talked about the walls being thin and I found this to be true as well but my room was on the back of the building so it was a lot less noisy. I was very comfortable in and outside of the hotel. The hotel is in a great location and easy to walk to everything Madrid has to offer, we never stepped foot in a cab. This hostal also allows guest which was nice being we had friends staying at another hotel who dropped by our room for a meeting place or to take a free drink in the room. Other hostals in Madrid charge for visitors to come to your room so please be aware when booking. My overall assessment is the hotel in UNDERPRICED and you get more than what you pay for.

The Hostal is in a really central location just off the Gran Via and a few minutes walk from the metro. The area around the hotel is a little \"colourful\" with lots of prostitutes hanging around in the street at all hours of the day and night. They never bothered me however and I didn't feel uncomfortable or unsafe in this neighbourhood. The hostal itself is very welcoming and the lady who checked me in was extremely friendly. The lounge area is funky and had a relaxing feel and the internet room was an added bonus as was the free wifi access. The hostal has a lift which made the trek to the fourth floor easy. My room was small but nicely decorated and very clean. It contained all the standard essentials you need plus the added bonus of a free to use safe. The bathroom was really clean and the shower very powerful which is a bonus. There was a small balcony which wasn't very private at all and the view was horrible but this wasn't the deal breaker. What really let down hostal Ballesta for me was the bed. On first impressions I was impressed by the size of the bed, it was more of a three-quarter double than a single. There was only one pillow provided which was wafer thin so on returning to the hostal after dinner I asked the guy on reception for another pillow. He seemed a little annoyed at being disturbued and went off to find me another pillow. I was really tired after such a long day and was looking forward to a comfortable sleep. I didn't get one. The matress was exceptionally hard and the springs were poking into me whenever I moved. I can honestly say without exception it was the most uncomfortable bed I've ever attempted to sleep in. For me the whole reason detre of a hotel is to provide a good night sleep. Unfortunately I didn't get one. The rock-hard bed was made even more uncomfortable by the plastic matress protector which made me sweat like mad all night. These plastic protectors are a real pet hate of mine. Having gone to bed just after 11:30pm I was still awake at 5am! Not a good nights sleep at all. The hostal was also quite noisy with other guests slamming doors and the walls between the rooms are so thin you can hear everything that your neighbour is doing. On check out I wasn't asked if everything was ok with my stay. The guy was quite brusque with me. The hostal could be brilliant if they sort out their beds and improve their soundproofing. However as it stands I was dissapointed by Hostal Ballesta it had so much potential but it did not deliver for me.
