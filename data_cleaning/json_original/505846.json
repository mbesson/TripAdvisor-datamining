One of the plus points of the hotel is its great and convinient location.

All around the hotel are schools and museums worth visiting! Room was clean although you have to bring your own toilteries as they will offer you next to nothing. I would have given it a perfect rating except for its staff at the Front Counter. Not one single soul was friendly. They will give you your room key and that's it! And don't bother to ask directions from them. They either don't care what you're asking about or they do not know where you're going! But what the heck!

Hint if you do stay here ask for a higher floor due to construction of new subway until 2017. Free WiFi. THE BAD: Only one front desk staff member was helpful, all others clearly didn't want to deal with people. Cleaning staff were so noisy in the early morning didn't need an alarm. Also other staff who seemed to live on our floor were up and down the hallways, yelling, banging in the corridor until 2 am every night. The beds are made of vinyl which is miserable to sleep on. Didn't get any sleep the entire stay. The floor was never swept, the bathroom is very dated, shower was never cleaned. Asked for an extra pillow, never got one. Asked about advertised tours on their website, was given a dirty look and told they don't book tours. Then ignored my further requests for tours. Staff doesn't smile, most people in Singapore don't. Here's an idea, if you don't like foreigners then get another job. THE UGLY: The location is mediocre. Nothing to see until you get to Marina Bay. Little india is a waste of time, Chinatown is good for a visit, the only nice part of Singapore is Marina. And the shopping is as expensive as Canada with the same stores so what's the point of buying. Not impressed with this hotel and not impressed with Singapore. People are very rude and the city is just a big shopping mall. Food is greasy everywhere.

The hotel doesn\u2019t change much. However, there was much more amazing for me to discover. Initial I though the closer MRT station was Dhoby Ghaut (which the important station for 2 lines interchange), in fact the nearer station is Bras Basah (Circle line, new line and also end to Dhoby Ghaut). Bras Basah station just next to food court in the junction. I also visited the new casino Marina Bay Sands, there is a direct bus no. 106 connecting to Bras Basah NTUC bus station. Future, it can be accessed by MRT Circle line. This time I am being observer carefully any changes compare with last time. Basically it doesn\u2019t change much, I am still easy to recognize the road and the building near by, searching easily. It is close to YMCA, and the whole street is having many hotels from budget range to luxury (Bay View, Strand Hotel, Ibis, Bancoolen Hotel, Rendezvous hotel and etc), really no worry for comparison among the same location. We were stayed in the pent house, is having a great city view. The hotel provide basic needs with drinking water and coffee 3-1, room is small and still using CRT TV, can not compare with those ranging hotel and we are paying low rate. I realized the queen bed is smaller than normal, recommend to have twin single bed. Wifi service is provided with password, renew everyday. Maybe it is pent house and close to aircond compressor and water heater, a bit noisy to my room. The location is very near to Orchard road and Bugis, within walking distance. As mentioned, one food court at the junction and opposite is 7-11 24hrs convenience shop. Is really an idea hotel to stay with reasonable price.

We arrived late as flights were grounded in Australia due to volcanic ash cloud. Instead of being given a proper twin room as we expected, we had something the size of a cupboard with a strange double bed made of two smaller ones put together. There was not enough space to separate them and they seemed glued in place looking like any double bed. Instead of having a non smoking room as we booked, we had one where people smoked for years and the last person must have smoked in there just a couple of hours before our arrival. We felt instantly sick and nauseated by the stench. This is not a hotel for tourists actually. It\u2019s more like a hostel for foreign workers. It is basic beyond basic, the corridors smell bad of sewage, tobacco, mold and food as people cook meals in their rooms probably \u2013 I saw some neighbors coming home with supermarket bags full of vegetables, oil, bread and raw meat. The smell of cooking was everywhere, obviously people lived there for long periods of time. The presentation on the Internet made this hotel look reasonably good, \u201ccheap and clean\u201d \u2013 actually the only clean things in it were the sheets on the beds \u2013 meaning they were washed - but that was about it. Otherwise, those sheets had patches everywhere and in places they also had holes the size of a penny, not to mention aged stains of rust, ink or bitumen that did not wash off. The elevator was a nightmare \u2013 it shut itself on you sharply while your foot was still in the door \u2013 literally! Before one had a chance to press any button, no matter how quickly you tried, it took the passenger god knows to what level. The hardest thing was to open its doors \u2013 it was purposely set extremely tight, not to open completely for some reason. You had to squeeze out. Therefore we found ourselves with two suitcases left in the corridor while we were taken swiftly 5 levels down with the rest of the luggage, without having a chance to leave the elevator and follow the suitcases. We worried about finding them again a good 10-12 minutes while the elevator collected 5-6 people and took them down 12 floors. When we arrived up again and managed with force to push the door open long enough to get out with the rest of our gear, we found two men examining our suit-cases with interest. At our sight, they made themselves scarce on the fire evacuation stairs. The door of the room did not lock securely. The air conditioning did not work properly but made a lot of noise and blew in a terrible mold stench. The key-card they gave us was only one, not two. It was bent and cracked and once we went out, the air conditioning was off and the tobacco and mold stench still there \u2013 more powerful than ever. The windows were primitively and carelessly screwed together with bent rusty bolts, not to be opened ever! (?) The walls had stains and scratches everywhere. The corners had built-up dirt gluing the walls to the floor. The bathroom had built-on scum and grime in between the tiles and in every crevasse. We put our suitcases in the wardrobe \u2013 with the way the door opened with just a push even without a card. We had no heart to leave them in full sight. We went out, searched for a while, found ourselves a proper hotel and moved less than 4 hours after arriving there\u2026 Do not go there if you can. Your deserve better, I'm sure. Anybody does.

Even though Hotel 81 is considered a budget hotel ,it's not super cheap and for what we paid we expected a decent,basic standard which we did not get so I can't recommend this hotel.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "manila", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for\u201d", "Author": "vavski", "ReviewID": "UR115940966", "Content": "good location- near bras basha mrt station, staff helpful but can still improve people skills- these are about the only positive thing i can say for this hotel no breakfast included, small room , not so clean bathroom , and you can really hear the noise outside the room, the linen and towels used have seen better days, no free wi fi", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hyderabad, India", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location - reasonable costs\u201d", "Author": "Ajay203", "ReviewID": "UR114783822", "Content": "The Hotel is located just off the Orchard Road and very close to the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station.

This may bother some families. However there there is no soliciting and the hotel staff is very matter of fact about handling this traffic. If you look the other way it should not bother you. The Hotel rooms are pretty tiny and the beds are encased in cheat leather. The staff is helpful and courteous.

I agree with the reviews that say the room is very clean. If a clean room, (besides the great location), is THE ONLY consideration when booking a hotel, go ahead and book the 81 Bencoolen. It is clean, but even a clean place can be below \u201cbasic\u201d. The cheapness of the place is overwhelming. Now, if you are like me, have outgrown the young adventurer in you, and consider that the place you sleep is, for at least one night, a proxy of your home, you surely want a bit more than that. For about \u00a320 more you can stay at the brand new Parc Sovereign (please see the review), or for \u00a330 more you can stay at the Ibis Bencoolen.

For a non-smoking room there were many cigarette burns in the bathroom sink and on the vanity top. The toilet flushed only every second time and there was a permanent drip coming through the bathroom ceiling. The 'beverages included' amounted to one sachet of pre-mixed Milo and one of coffee per day. No milk. The creamer is in the pre-mix. The fridge in the 'superior' room had so much ice around the freezer compartment I couldn't open the door. It was this function I really wanted so that I could freeze some ice cubes to put in my water for my next day's touring. So I defrosted it myself and took the huge lump of ice down to reception to show them. They said 'Sorry'. The bed was the hardest I have ever slept on, with a vinyl covered mattress and threadbare sheets that barely fit. Turn over once and the bottom sheet had rumpled up leaving me to lie on the bare vinyl. And don't ask me about breakfast! YUK. This hotel has no restaurant of its own so breakfast is in a nightclub next door which is even seedier than Hotel 81. The access is through the night-club which smells of stale tobacco and burning incence, and 'tastefully' decorated in red and black. Overcooked frankfurters, solid scrambled eggs, sticky noodles and baked beans. Packet orange-flavoured cordial and coffee. All of it stone cold and tasting gross. All in all, grossly overpriced although in a handy location.

I don't know what sort of guests Hotel 81 anticipates, but I'm not sure if I was grateful for, or repulsed by the vinyl covered mattress that repelled sheets for an uncomfortable night's sleep. The bathroom proved to be a treat too. The toilet seat was broken and there was a discarded sanitary pad bag behind the toilet. I would have thought that the broken seat would have given housekeeping easy access to the crud that was there, but they appear to have ignored this great opportunity. There was no shower curtain, which probably explains why the bathroom floor was quite clean compared to the room, that is, apart from previous occupants\u2019 hair both on the floor and in the bath \u2013 helpful at a crime scene I suppose, but not appreciated in a hotel room.
