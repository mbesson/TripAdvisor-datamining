We ate dinner at the restaurant several times and the food was always fantastic. Kim Parker and the rest of the staff at the hotel gave us superior service and great recommendations around town. Kim even gave us a great lead on a roof top bar that would allow us to celebrate the birthday in style. Kim even gave us sparklers to toast her with. That level of service and detail is not easily found. The hotel is 5 stars all the way. You won't find this level of service and detail anywhere else.

Also, the entire staff was great, working as a team, without the \"attitude\" so common today at nice places. I worked all day writing while sitting at the bar (its' closed during the day), and accomplished my goals. The food is good (my wife is a \"foodie\") and we always eat there during our stays. Its just nice when your on the road, and get where your going, to not have to go somewhere else to have a drink, eat, or just chill-out. Its just a great place to be.There is a little road noise, due to its proximity to the street, and the bar crowd can create some noise if you turn in early. We usually ask for a room towards the back that is a little more quite. I guess in summation I would say that if you enjoy the mortuary quite, cookie-cutter corporate hotel style, stay at one of those. They're all the same, and easy to find.

My husband and I had booked a room at the pearl for 6 nights, but we had also just been in Vegas for 6 nights so needless to say we had a LOT of luggage etc. when we arrived at the pearl we were greeted by the smell of delicious food, good music, friendly staff and lots of other guests/locals just having a good time! When we arrived at our room we were greeted by a modern sophisticated, environmentally friendly, clean space! However due to the fact that this is a boutique hotel the rooms were too small for us (this time due to the fact we had so much luggage and we had 6 more days of travel) I should mention that although the rooms are small they have made good use of the space! My husband and I decided that it was just not the type of room we needed for this trip. I reluctantly made my way back to the front desk to ask if we could cancel our room and was expecting them to charge us for half of the stay which is the policy at almost every hotel and is also fair....I was happily surprised by an entirely different scenario...the gal at the front desk apologized for the room being to small and offered to move us to their slightly larger room which would have been great but another guest had specially requested that room for a portion of our stay, so instead the gal at the front desk cancelled our reservation, offered to make a new reservation for us at a different hotel and gave us 2 free drinks to use when we return to the pearl for supper (which we will because the food smelled great and the atmosphere was awesome!) In short...although we did not end up staying I wanted my review to show others that you DO NOT come across service like this often...even at 5 star properties...at the pearl they really do put guests first even if it means they lost out on a reservation! For this reason alone when we return to San Diego again (under different circumstances less luggage etc) we will definitely stay at the pearl!

It was rather difficult to find a hotel that could meet per diem rates in San Diego while providing a unique experience to the area. A little digging online and I found The Pearl. I took a chance and booked it for the whole 10 days of my trip. This turned out to be an excellent decision! What a fun place! The hotel is small and parking is limited, but they were extremely generous and hospitable. The hotel has a fantastic bar with about a dozen or so taps of all local crafted beer (no macro stuff on tap here) that was a real pleasure to drink. Their bartender manager has created some really delicious drinks here that at first may raise an eyebrow when reading the description, but will have you ordering another before you know it. Also the hotel does dinner every night, but Sunday. This is not your run of the mill sub-par hotel food either, these dishes are made to impress and they do at that. The presentation, taste, and ingredients are all something you would expect to see on a plate at a fine dining restaurant, but the prices can't be beat by comparison. You can get some exquisite scallops here for a little over twenty bucks. Also they have an appetizer of dates, stuffed with blue cheese and wrapped in bacon that's out of this world. It is a bit decadent, though, so share with a friend. My room was great. There was a Beta fish in a bowl named, Flo, to keep me company throughout the week. My room had a nice walk out patio and sitting area with a table and chairs that provided adequate privacy with walls separating you from the rooms to either side of you and wall of swaying bamboo to shield you from prying eyes from the buildings next door. It was a very relaxing setting. Since I was there on business I sometimes needed to get online with my laptop and I was pleased to find that the Pearl offers Wi-Fi complimentary to the room. And one great thing about that was I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to deal with terrible internet speeds because it's not some massive chain hotel with hundreds of rooms sharing the same pipeline. This was a huge plus for me. One thing I should note, if you are an early riser you should be aware that there are many people that come to The Pearl simply for the bar and restaurant so the noise level could be a bit much for you if you are a light sleeper and need to go to bed before 11PM (when the bar closes on the weekdays). For me, none of these things were a problem. I found the noise level to be just fine and I was getting up at 6AM every morning. Go here and you will not be disappointed. The drinks are great, the food is great, and the staff is super friendly. They will engage in conversation with you and address you by name. For example, one evening while I was having dinner the chef came out for something and when I saw him I complemented the meal and the great beer on tap. We got to chatting and before long he was pouring tasters of all their stuff on tap and suggesting other great places to go for a drink. I love microbrews and brewpubs so this was all great info. Another night I got to talking with Jaime, the bar manager, who comes up with some really amazing and unique drinks at the hotel. Before long he was experimenting like a mad chemist and we were all trying out new drink prototype samples. If you want a place that is fun, relaxed, and friendly where you can get a great drink, a fantastic meal, and a nice room at a great rate then this is the place to go.

CON Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the fact I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy a beer at the hotel bar before 5pm, but I do understand Liquor laws. (There is a liquor store about 50 steps away and they have all the drinks, mixes, and snacks you need, along with great service too!) Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like that there was no fridge in the room, but they did offer to keep my beer in their fridge, loved that! Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like that there was no coffee maker in the room, overseen on my part (I never stay at a place without a coffee machine and fridge, but this was the exemption I guess), but the lack of coffee machine was tempered with the offer of free morning coffee at the lobby bar, and strong coffee too, a great wake-up bonus! RECOMMENDATIONS TO MANAGEMENT: THE ROOMS ARE GOOD OVERALL, COOL AND VERY CLEAN, THANK YOU. BUT DO CHECK OUT SMALL BATHROOM REPAIRS SUCH AS BENT SHOWER RODS, WORN BATHROOM FLOOR TILES, TUBS THAT HAVE THE PORCELAIN WORN OUT(MAYBE TIME FOR LINERS?) ALSO, DON'T FORGET TO REPLENISH THE H2O SPA BATH PRODUCTS ONCE THEY ARE GONE. CONSIDER ALSO PURCHASING NEW RETRO CHAIRS AND TABLES POOLSIDE; THEY ARE OLD AND THE LINEN CHAIRS POOL-SIDE ARE DIRTY AND NOT INVITING TO SIT AROUND AT!

After finally staying, it more than lived up to the hype! I stayed in two rooms during my stay: the gem and the jewel. The first night was the gem, and it was the smallest room I have ever stayed in... however it was also one of the best for it's price (even compared to rooms three times it's size at other hotels!) I was easily able to plug my laptop into the HDMI port of the 42 inch tv mounted near the wall, and then sit on the bed and control some of the movies I have prepared for my evening. The bed itself was also VERY comfortable, and featured a very lightweight summer comforter sandwiched between two clean and very soft (high thread count I imagine) sheets. The second nights stay was in the Jewel. The jewel was much larger and had a larger bed as well. The bed was the exact same make it seems so it was also very comfortable, and there was again a large HD television (panasonic) in the room for me to plug my computer into easily via an HDMI port. Also in both rooms were two wonderful little beta fish (one per room) which me and my girlfriend found quite amusing (I've never seen fish in a hotel room before!) All in all, I would steer clear of the gem if you are claustrophobic or dislike small spaces, but if you're anything like me, and love cozy little places that are well furnished and VERY practical, then you will love the \"bachelor pad\" that is the gem. I have never stayed in the pearl's largest room as they were sold out both nights, but I can bet they are very nice! All in all, if you're looking for a luxurious get away, the pearl is not for you, but if you have an interest in something different you just might love it. The staff was also extremely friendly and helpful - some of the best i've ever experienced even compared to the nearby resorts.

It struck a perfect balance between maintaining the original charm and injecting just enough modern style.

We stayed in one of the standard rooms for two nights. While the room was on the small side, it was perfectly adequate. It had been mostly updated with new furniture, carpet, and tv. The bathroom renovation seemed to stop at the tub, which was original and run down. It also lacked a full sized mirror and had a loud AC. However, the room was equipped with a fighting fish named Felix! In the daytime, the Hotel was relatively quiet. It is located on a busy street, but the noise wasn't really a factor. Come evening, it turns into a totally happening bar/ restaurant, which was completely packed. We had a couple of drinks and a dessert, both were excellent.

I have to say though, the staff did seem a little confused and overwhelmed at times and organization was not the best. The rooms themselves were nice. We had a pet fish which was a nice touch. We missed having a fridge though, and there wasn't much storage space for clothes etc. I can't help but get the feeling that they decided to spent the money on the look of the place rather than on the extra room provisions that would have made our stay a little more comfortable. They run a film night by the pool/bar which was a neat idea, except that we couldn't hear the film, so that kind of ruined that. Shame.

The lobby lounge area is essentially a collection of carpeted nooks with pillows and all manner of classic games such as Rock-em Sock-em Robot where guests could entertain themselves while they enjoyed a drink. Upon checking into our room we were delighted to find a very comfortable room decorated in an artfully retro and unique style. The vintage Art Deco theme works very well and I found the inclusion of our own beta fish to be a nice touch. I learned that each of The Pearl rooms come equipped with its own beta, each with their own introductary name plate. For our stay, Willie contently swam in his bowl offering a homey charm. The bed was extremely comfortable and the high-def flatscreen television offered several channels for viewing enjoyment. The room made great use of space and offered plenty of storage for extended stays, as well as a couch and table and all the usual amenities. The bathroom was full-size which gave me the understanding that at some point in its past our room had been a studio apartment. The platform bed was extremely comfortable and with a strong AC system, my wife and I slept very soundly during our stay. As active as the social scene was at the pool it was amazingly quiet in the room even with parties going on. I learned that The Pearl prides itself on being a very active hotel that appeals to energetic adults. This became very clear later in the evening when the hotel started showing its poolside movie. In keeping with the cool Rat Pack-era vibe and motif of the hotel, we watched classic episodes of Get Smart from the bar. While more modern films are shown it is nice to see that the hotel isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afraid to mix things up now and then and having the option to either watch a movie from the poolside or from the bar overlooking the pool just emphasized the laidback and relaxed ambience. The cocktails offered by the bar were highly enjoyable and while we did not get a chance to enjoy the restaurant during our visit I noticed the extremely impressive menu and that the dining options has been cited for excellence in several publications. The hotel is located near Shelter Island in downtown San Diego and offers unique and value accommodations for travelers. There are several restaurants and convenience stores all within walking distance of the hotel should you choose not to dine on-site. This is good as parking is a bit limited at the hotel but the very friendly and helpful staff does have spots marked off by cones which can be accessed upon check-in. One does not normally find as comfortable a room in a friendly and energetic place when traveling, especially amongst the higher priced, more sedate hotels. It was refreshing to find such a unique place and friendly staff doing things their way instead of being a cookie-cutter of the larger chain hotels which often dominate the travelers options. The Pearl was a very unique and enjoyable experience punctuated by a friendly staff that went out of their way to ensure that the guests have a good time. Larger hotels can definitely take a lesson from these folks as they are clearly doing something right and I encourage you to check out The Pearl during your next visit to San Diego.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cGreatest hotel expirence, ever.\u201d", "Author": "PaulinaHC", "ReviewID": "UR115378702", "Content": "I can't say enough good things about our stay at The Pearl.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never felt the urge to write a review of a hotel before, but I really wanted to for this hotel as I was so pleased we found this little gem & wanted to share our experience with others thinking of staying here. 7 of us Brits (age ranges between 30 & 62) arrived at the Pearl late on a Sunday night in November 2010 after driving from Las Vegas. The service we received at check in was great, we were advised on where to park our car (if you park on the street round the corner, its free as opposed to paying for parking outside) & were shown to our rooms. It was nearly midnight when we got our luggage out of the car & into our room when we discovered a (very minor) issue with our room. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to mention it to reception but thought we would bring it to their attention. Without going into lots of detail (as it would be boring!), we received the best service over our 4 day stay we have ever had on our many trips to the US from this hotel. The reception staff were fantastic in helping to resolve our problem & they went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our stay at the Pearl. You can tell this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a chain restaurant & is a family run hotel as the little touches made a big difference to our stay. For example, they leave a note after cleaning your room each day telling you what the next day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weather will be & the menu for that evening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dinner at the restaurant. We were very fortunate to be offered a free meal at the hotel, to be totally honest we were hesitant at eating in the restaurant as we like to explore the local area rather than eat at our hotel for dinner. We were very pleasantly pleased at how yummy the food was, both my husband & I had the burger & loved it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lying when they claim it to be the best burger in the area! We were only disappointed that we left it till our last night to eat there as we would have had more food there had we ate there earlier. We ate in the outside little garden terrace & although it was a chilly November night, it has several garden heaters that made it a nice cosy area to eat & drink in. Before we headed out for the evenings, we had a few drinks in the bar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the beer drinkers in our party were impressed at the wide array of lagers & ales on offer. I had a lavender cocktail that I remember being very tasty indeed. There is a good seating area around the pool / cinema screen to enjoy drinks from the bar. With regards to the room, each one has its own fish tank on the wall which is something I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never seen before in a hotel & I loved this detail. Between us we had 4 rooms so I got to see all rooms & all were of good standard. The location is pretty good, we drove to SeaWorld, San Diego Zoo & Old Town \u00e2\u20ac\u201c none of which took that long to get to. For the evenings that we went out into San Diego, the hotel rang up for a taxi & it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take long to reach our destination. Overall, I would rate this hotel very highly & if you are thinking about booking this hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I recommend that you do as you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t regret it. 6 months on, all 7 of us who went on the trip adored this hotel & we still talk about our stay there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was a real highlight of our 2 week stay to Las Vegas, San Diego, Anaheim & LA. If we ever go back to San Diego, I will make sure we stay at this hotel & if anyone who works at the hotel is reading this \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thank you very much for the fabulous service!", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely Stay Here if in SD Area\u201d", "Author": "dastmal", "ReviewID": "UR107990176", "Content": "we wanted a quick get-away from LA that was fun, hip and relaxing.

The room was nice - modern with a beachy feel. The platform bed was comfortable, the bathroom was old, but renovated to look modern, the carpet was clean, and all the essentials were present (shampoo/conditioner, soap, lotion, and blowdryer). The lighting, however, was very dim with all the lights on and the heater/air very noisy. Overall, it was a comfortable room. And the fish was a unique touch. The other reviews were accurate about the noise level. It seemed like a popular place for people to hang out, even right outside our 1st floor room. We didn't mind since we were extremely tired from our morning of kayaking. Upon our check out, the same girl was at the desk. She didn't ask us how our stay was and did not thank us for our stay. I think I even thanked her without a response. Not only did we not receive a welcoming vibe from her, but also the other employees both at check in and check out. We appreciated the emails before and after our stay and our welcome postcard in our room, but those were the only things that showed us the staff cared. We would have rather received the same attention in person. The Pearl is a beautiful property and close to many restaurants, essentials, and attractions but I would not recommend the hotel to friends simply because of the hotel staff's lack of customer service.

I was surprised how many people showed up in the evening for dinner (we did not eat there). The room was clean and chic, but sparse. The bed was comfortable. It was incredibly quiet. However, by the condition of the bathroom, it was evident this was once a low quality motel: outdated bathroom fixtures, black stained tiles. Considering the reasonable price, other than the condition of the bathroom, I thought the hotel was good otherwise.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delray Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNest with a View\u201d", "Author": "FootWhisperer", "ReviewID": "UR95301793", "Content": "The Pearl's been really good to me everytime I've stayed!

My fiancee and I drove to San Diego for a weekend of work and play and we LOVED the Pearl. What a fantastic, sweet little modern gem in the middle of Point Loma. First of all- disclaimer- I am an extreme bargain hunter with high expectations. So I did my homework on the surrounding areas. You can't beat the price! We pulled in and parked on the same street as the hotel, then went to check in. The hostess/receptionist was totally nice and directed us to our room. After driving 6 hours, having a bunk meeting with someone in southern San Diego and ending up at the Pearl on the rainiest and coldest weekend we could have imagined- we could have been in a sour mood. But the Pearl made us happy! It has a great vibe- very California motel, local, fun. Our room was simple and the satellite radio didn't work but our internet was great and the bed was comfortable and we had a coupon for a bottle of wine when we arrived so really- it was all good. Also, the restaurant was hopping when we came back form a trip to LA that night. A bummer that we had to eat in LA- we really wanted to check out the restaurant. I WISH there was a place like the Pearl in LA, where we go for work more often... we're actually thinking of booking at the Pearl and just driving up. RECOMMENDED!!

They have done some cute things to spruce up an old motel, but it is still an old stinky motel in the end. It is near the airport and would be fine for anyone looking for a bed and a TV, even better if they do not have a sense of smell. I booked the largest room called the \"Strand\" based on the room photo and description on the pearl's website. The room they gave me was the exact photo of the smaller and cheaper \"Jewel\" but the front desk insisted that I was in the right room. They had described the room as spacious (450 SQ FT) with a couch and comfy soft chairs. They promised framed art, chrome accents, high thread count sheets, \"room to roam\" and a large wooden desk. None of these things were in my room. The room was about 100 square feet and the art on the wall was literally a child's crayon drawing about four inches by four inches. No couch, no comfy chair, no desk and no chrome accents but for the Kleenex box. The sheets looked and felt like hospital sheets, I'd guess about 100 thread count. The mattress was about three inches thick and felt like it was fifty years old. Mushy and nasty, I could not even think of sleeping there. The first thing that hit me when I entered the room was the strong smell of nasty air freshener. they literally had one of those tacky oil diffusers sitting on the table. It was clearly masking something, probably the nasty gray carpet that looked like it used to be a different color and was total stain now. They had a few nice design details that I do give them credit for, it looked cuter than your average dive hotel. But to promise high thread count, room to roam and a seating area and then offer none of the sort, that is just plain false advertising. They say that they have four of these rooms on the website but the person working admitted that they had only one and it was out of order. Even though I arrived at midnight, I still refused the room and found exceptional accommodations nearby for the same price. Seriously I ended up with a beach side bungalow with a kitchen and living room for the same price as the Pearl. The person who wrote the ad copy describing the room could have been on crack.

I had a fish in my room named Barnaby. The hotel provided wifi. The rooms open out to an outside common area. The nights can be noisy with people coming in late. If your a light sleeper there may be issues with the noise. I would recommend The Pearl to people who enjoy a boutique hotel. If you want a really quiet space I would not recommend this hotel because it is not laid out in a way that minimizes noise. I got what I expect and I was pleased. I did not have a car so I relied on taxi service to and from the conference. I spoke to the hotel before booking and they said that taxis were easily available. I had the front desk call for a taxi each day. They were hit and miss. One day a taxi might take 5 min the next day 20.

We did come a bit early (4PM) so perhaps the spots were unoccupied for this reason. Walking into the lobby/bar was nice, it looked clean and inviting, and it set hopes up high for our room. The staff was excellent and very helpful. They were extremely friendly and warm. Finally, getting to our room was a different story. We stayed in the Jewel, and the room itself looked drab, like a downgraded version of the pictures provided on the website. There was a dead plant on the desk, the carpet was rough, there was a hair on the pillow, and the room in general was not completely clean, but it was still acceptable to stay in for a night. We tried to look past these little nuances but the bathroom is what ruined our stay. The bathroom inside of the room was filthy. Of course we didn't expect an upscale 5 star bathroom from The Pearl, but there was cracks in the tile with dirty grout, rust and dirt on what looked like a new faucet, permanent stains around the toilet, a weird glob of something on the wall, a big orange/brown spot on the shower curtain that looked strange along with many other dirty spots, and a bathtub with a filthy floor and cracks all through out. We took a piece of toilet paper and ran it across the top of the toilet paper dispenser only to find dust and a strange brown sticky liquid left on the toilet paper. The bathroom was the worst bathroom I have ever been in in any hotel, and I have been to some pretty downscale motels like Motel 6. Perhaps we got unlucky and received a badly renovated room, but if so, I still believe no guest should have to deal with a bathroom like that. Besides that, there was street traffic and noise from the bar downstairs, but the noise from the bar stopped at 10PM. The noise from the street seemed to be more distracting than the bar noise, and our room was close to the bar. So to sum it up: PROS: -Excellent staff. -Cool lobby and bar area. -\"Dive-in\" movies were fun.

The layout of the rooms is great, quirky very mid-century but the lack of hospitality and lack of basic professionalism by the Hotel staff makes me give this Hotel a resounding NEVER AGAIN.

For example, flat screen TVs...yes, in the room - but also next to the tables by the pool...and of course, hard to miss the huge projection screen facing the pool - part of their whole \"Dive in\" experience, a unique touch that no other low-budget motel that I know of has thought of. Yes, the rooms are small and relatively spartan but fresh updates abound in many locations both in and out of the rooms, which help to give a nice, more modern feel to the place. What I liked the most though was the dinner experience. I sat both nights at the bar for dinner and enjoyed conversation with the people next to me at the bar as well as with the bartenders. The menu is appreciated by many locals as well, so many of the guests who eat there are not actually guests of the hotel but instead are people who simply know the restaurant as a great place to eat. One thing that would be nice would be to have a small computer area so that guests can do things like print out boarding passes. I can understand why such a computer doesn't exist though, since the space in the lobby is so small. Perhaps an alternative solution could be to provide guests with an email address at check-in in case they need to print out anything at the front desk (so they can email the document to be printed out). I should say thought that the staff is very friendly and will gladly assist in printing out anything that you need printed out on their computer. Overall, this was a great experience. If your definition of boutique is purely upscale, then this may not be the place for you. But, if you enjoy modern updates coupled with some thoughtful retro design elements in lobby/lounge area, at a no-frills, low-budget price and are willing to concede on extra amenities and space, then this is the place for you.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cA TRUE GEM WITH FANTASTIC SERVICE and STAFF\u201d", "Author": "pazosa", "ReviewID": "UR79800304", "Content": "Great, small boutique property with European-feeling flair & sophistication.

It was evening, so there were people in the bar and we felt a bit uncomfortable to go through them. However, the girl named Adel was very friendly and accommodating. She showed us another room upstairs, which was much less noisy and had a bigger bed and more spacious. We stayed there at no additional charge. Both rooms were clean and the one downstairs even had nice mirrors on the ceiling. Also, they had beta fish in small tanks in both rooms and H2O shampoo/conditioner/lotion.

The layout of the hotel is such that you enter into the reception/bar area that opens out on to the pool. The events take place in the bar / pool area. The staff made it clear that guests were welcome to all, and we didn't feel too awkward hanging out in the bar area however: 1) Ourselves and another two individual guests we befriended were unable to take a nap in the afternoons due to the noise of the events - particularly the skater party whereby the attendees congregated outside our rooms chatting and shrieking loudly. 2) The skater party was filled with underage drinkers, people smoking pot and the path to our room was completely blocked by the large group of teenagers outside our door. We were on the first floor so the path is an outdoor balcony that overlooks the pool. We were eventually compelled to leave the hotel to eat out and returned later to find the police had been called to break up the party. Anybody in their right mind could have predicted this outcome.

We purchased a package that included the cost of parking at the hotel. I highly recommend this as the hotel parking spots are limited and street parking can be challenging at times. The package also included two cocktails and an appetizer each day we were there. We had no idea how fantastic the food was going to be and when we did, we totally took advantage of those coupons. We ate dinner twice at the restaurant and had Sunday brunch. The food choices went beyond the ordinary (brushetta with squash...who knew?), the service was fantastic (Vanessa our waitress was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive), and the food quality was outrageous. We loved the restaurant so much we decided not to go out the 2nd night and dine in again after eating at the hotel the night before. The meals were affordable especially since we ended up getting an entree for free each night for a birthday special and because we used a coupon they have online. You can dine by the pool or inside, but regardless it is an open air restaurant with a great atmosphere which includes groovy tunes and a movie running at the Dive-In Theatre (soundless of course as the music sets the mood). We liked our room as it was clean, well decorated (60s retro), had quality electronics, and most importantly the bed was comfortable. The pet fish was also a great touch! The room was just big enough as we tend to be out more than we stay in. The pool is really a nice to have and I especially enjoyed cat naps in the hammock swings that are right next to it. The hotel was close in proximity to just about everything making it so easy and quick to get around: La Jolla, Sea World, Mission Bay, downtown, Balboa Park, Little Italy, etc... The staff went out of their way to help us get acclimated to the area and settled comfortably at the hotel. John even moved a table from inside to out by the pool for dinner when we asked for an outside seat and there weren't any left. Now that is what I call Service! Ironically we also ran into our waitress Vanessa at a local restaurant she had recommended where she greeted us with hugs and excitement! Overall this staff made us feel at home and even went beyond that by giving us VIP treatment without the VIP cost. Overall I would say this hotel is better for adults as the atmosphere lends to it.

In the first room (standard) the faucet of the shower was dripping but they fixed it properly as soon as we told them. The rooms were clean and nicely furnished (modern style) and the beds were large and very comfortable. The hotel has a pool and a bar which is probably very nice in summer time but we didn't take advantage of them. The Pearl might not be a good place for people who are sensitive to noise. The adjacent road (Rosecrans Street) is a very frequented street and the hotel opens onto the road. So there are more quiet rooms and less quiet rooms. However we did not have a problem with the noise, nor with the bar having loud music till rather late one night. The water and the harbor are very close by car and there's a place Point Loma Caf\u00c3\u00a9 that can be recommended for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Overall the Pearl was a decent stay for its price, although the parking fee might be reduced by about 2$ (currently 10$ a night). Also we personally didn't like the fish in the room. A small bowl at the wall, empty except for one lonely fish. I am sure they are feed properly but lonely like that, no plants, nothing, that's not a life.

Overall we had a pretty good stay with a few minor complaints. The accommodations are very clean & trendy.

It is true that the washrooms have minimal renos (faucets & lights) but they are clean. The staff is friendly. The food is delicious (we found a coupon on their website that gave us 2 for 1 dinner entrees if we purchased 2 drinks) however we had more than two since we were crawling distance to our room and our waitress let us know that they had some wines on special for $5/glass. And the location is fantastic. Biggest downfall is parking. We paid an additionally $10/day (which we figured would guarantee us a spot) however on Saturday night we didn't finding parking and were told they'd deduct the cost from our bill (but forgot to) and told to park across the street in the Medical clinic as they don't check on weekends. The only time we benefited from the parking pass was the first day when we wanted to offload our suitcases.

Parking Friday & Sat night is the biggest issues. The other issue we had was the paper thin walls. You can hear everything. I had issues sleeping one day because someone was chatting outside.

The bed was comfortable, the television was the same one we have in our home in L.A., and we had a fish named Wolfgang for our roommate. The housekeeping was great...I requested a radio and he/she brought us this cool radio with programmed/ satellite channels, did a great job of cleaning the room, and left extra shampoo (by request). The manager (I think) was really nice as well...on Sunday afternoon he was about to close the bar but kept it open for 1-2 hours to serve my friends and I drinks. They have a really cute pool area with cabanas, and a large screen where movies were shown on one of the nights we were there. The only suggestions I have which would make this place a little better would be that the bathrooms are very basic and in need of some upgrading and the hotel is a little noisy.

I think The Pearl is my dream hotel because it really did provide everything I want in a hotel. First and foremost, the style and vibe of the place is amazing. When we arrived on a warm July Sunday around noon, there was a full-fledged pool party going on! Everyone was lounging around with drinks and listening to some great music poolside, some were finishing their brunch which is served every Sunday during the warm months. I didn't get a chance to join the fun that day, but I was jealous of those who did. It's an great example of mid-century googie architecture, but the owners have done an amazing job of renovating the place with one eye on maintaining it's vintage charm and the other eye on tasteful, hip modern design. I love the fact that they brought new life to this old hotel. There is a kidney bean shaped pool in the center courtyard and set next to it is an open-air full bar and restaurant. I think there are probably less than 20 rooms total at The Pearl which makes for a boutique feel. Despite the party in the courtyard, our room was quiet and a great place to relax. It was all brand new and styled like it should be featured in Dwell magazine. Wait, has this place been featured in Dwell? If not it should be. The room had a flat screen TV, lots of Ikea style furnishings, and a very comfortable bed. Oh, and it came with a goldfish named Cosmo! He swam around quietly in his bowl and was a great roommate. The location is great, very close to Downtown San Diego and the whole surrounding area, with restaurants all around. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The one issue is that you have to be careful about parking in the neighborhood. Apparently the police like giving tickets for the smallest parking infractions. However, the staff is very interested in helping that not be a problem for the guests, they will give you pointers and even spot for you while you park your car. So, not a problem really, just be careful parking your car. The The Pearl is my dream hotel because it has great prices, an amazing pool, clean, comfortable and stylish rooms, a welcoming staff, a full bar and restaurant, great and unique architecture and interior design, and it's in a perfect location.

I just hope that when we first arrived the sheets were freash and not from the previous guest. I read the reviews before we got there, and it seems as though I got the room with the leaky tub faucet that someone else mentioned. I thought the bathroom could have used more light.

We did reserve parking one night, because we went out to a wedding and I wasn't sure what time we'd get back. They made the mistake of charging me for 2 nights, but were very quick to fix it and refund me. They also had these cool radios in the rooms that played specific stations.

I went to the hotel's website before I made the booking to see what it was all about and it looked like a very swanky place to stay complete with gorgeous interior styling and H20 bath products (I'm such a sucker for products). When my friend and I got there it was quite late at night as I'd flown down to San Diego after work and the club lounge downstairs was lively with lots of drunk beautiful people. We were a little bit unclear about where to check in, reception is actually just inside to the left away from the lounge. We then walked upstairs past the pool and outdoor film screen to go to our room where we were in for a great surprise.

I read all the reviews before we went, so I was under no illusions that this would be a quiet place, a luxurious place, or a perfect hotel. We had never stayed at a non-chain, and I wanted to check it out anyway. We really enjoyed our stay. We checked in on a Monday, and not too many guests were staying on a Monday. I was prepared to ask for a room away from the pool area if necessary, but we got one without asking. (Number 17.) It was near a side street, so street noise wasn't too bad, but we had to run the AC at all times because the room got really stuffy if we did not, and the AC was very loud. Still, if you don't mind loud fans running, that doesn't seem like a big deal to me. Plenty of chain hotels are the same way. Some of the rooms are RIGHT next to the pool. I wouldn't have liked to stay in one of those rooms. A few of the reviews mentioned that there was no place for breakfast nearby. This is not true (or I guess it may be true depending on your definition of breakfast). A Starbucks and a smoothie place are about two blocks away, and there was another restaurant that appeared to be serving breakfast maybe 3-4 blocks away, although we did not check it out. It is not the most pedestrian-friendly area, but it is possible to get to these places without an automobile. Also - the restaurant does have coffee available in the mornings. They set up a coffeepot at the bar. One day the cleaning people did not clean the room while we were out, but I was able to find someone to ask about getting clean towels in the meantime, and the cleaning crew was still around, so the room was cleaned when we went out again later. The food at the restaurant was phenomenal. I had this mushroom risotto that was just wonderful, and the drinks were great too. We ended up splurging for a daily guaranteed parking spot. It was our honeymoon, after all. I think it was $25 a day. This required us to ask someone to move a cone to our spot after we left for the day, but after the first time we just did it ourselves rather than bother anyone. Street parking seemed to be relatively available, but it was still nice to have that guaranteed spot and not have to worry about it. We paid in cash, and they were not really equipped to handle payment in cash. They didn't have any change, and the bar was not open.

Sometimes staying in cheap motels is the way to go and you don't expect the most comfortable bed. However, for a romantic getaway, when you're really thinking hard about where you want to stay and have the cash to stay in a wide variety of properties, it is a huge disappointment when even the basics aren't met by a hotel that looks like it ought to just fine. The website looks awesome. While I saw some of the negative reviews here: small rooms, noise from both the club (it's a club, ok!) and the road (wow, that is a surprisingly busy road!), what no one mentioned is that the beds are CRAZY BAD. Cheap, soft beds and crappy pillows. It is like staying in a dorm room. It was one of the worst night sleeps I've had in a long memory and certainly not the quality I was expecting. I could feel the springs in my back on the lousy mattress. Yikes! Here's what I disliked about this hotel besides the terrible, low end bedding. 1. Shower was broken. 2. Room had strange moldy smell, like bad venting from hotel and our room felt very airless quickly, even in the cool night. 3. Loud (it is, after all, just a cheap, badly constructed roadside hotel on a busy road...) and so everyone who mentioned how loud it was, I agree! Wow, it was loud! And we had the room in the far, back corner, though it seems next to some kind of generator. 4. Dying fish in room. Our little fish, colorless, lifeless and barely alive. Yikes! A gimick gone horribly wrong... 5. Burnt out light bulb in hallway: it's a small thing, but that's what sets apart a good boutique hotel from a dingy highway motel right? It was hard to see the lock on our door. Again, the expectation, based on the website was pretty high... We had one of the four deluxe rooms and I would definitely have not wanted anything smaller. It did not feel deluxe and did not match the website expectation. I'll mention the service. In a word, definitely NOT boutique service... the bartender had to look up how to make a Manhattan (which was terrible), the front desk did not know how much it would cost to take a cab to the airport, the waitress did not know if there would be coffee in the morning (there's no coffee pots in the rooms) and had to think of places to recommend... it just seemed like everyone was new and you'd think based on the extreme BRANDING and professional gloss they put on everything that traveler basics would be drilled into the staff. Finally, let me mention dinner. Slow night on a Monday, even with the Prix Fixe menu, but it still took over two hours to get our appetizer, dinner and dessert and not in that happy French cafe slow service way. Waitress was apologetic, explaining that they only had one chef in the kitchen but then they only had three tables going! If the chef can't handle three tables, boy howdy. Our dinner order was mixed up with wrong food and while they ended up comping the meal generously, it certainly wasn't how we expected to spend a good chunk of our evening in San Diego. We waited and waited and waited. Though it gave us more time to drink wine out of plastic cups since we sitting next to the pool. Oh! the indignity! The romance ruined! This hotel would likely be just fine and fun if you were there for one of the party nights, thought you'd get some action and romance, and booked a room using their after midnight love special. Maybe that would be fun. I'm not terribly pissed off at the experience since I like trying non-chain hotels and got a room for $99.00 off-season special, but it was DEFINITELY NOT the experience I was hoping for (a special end to a great holiday) and felt the website and presentation was misleading enough to post my first review on this site as a warning to others. I would definitely not stay here again.

I looked around and did a lot of research on local hotels and was really excited to snag a room here. We usually stay at bigger chains like the W, Westin or Omni, but I thought a little boutique hotel (that is in the fun Point Loma area) would be a nice change. Unfortunately it didn't quite work out as hoped. The average rates for 2-star chains (Ramada, et al) are about $150. Higher end (W, Hard Rock, Omni) are about $300. This was in the high middle, about $255 after taxes. The girl on the phone offered me a free room upgrade (from queen bed to king), which was nice of her. I also signed up for the \"essentials package\" (free parking plus 1 appetizer and 2 drinks at their restaurant/bar) for an additional $35. Essentials package is fine for the money - if you want the drinks and apps. Parking was nice, because the street parking is hard to come by on a weekend. Good news is there's free wireless internet. Better news is that ll of the staff are really cool, friendly and accommodating. From the check-in girl (who saved a parking spot for me in the tiny lot with her own car) to the bartender (who took good care of me, even though she was slammed with a party), they all were really sweet and ran their butts off taking care of the guests. Best part was that the food was surprisingly delicious. We had late-night snacks, desserts and drinks in our room and were THRILLED. The hotel is TINY. There's a tiny pool surrounded by tiny rooms. Our room had a king bed (quite comfy) that nearly took up the whole space. The shower was nice (love the rain showerhead), except that it was a little grimy. Could have been cleaner. It was noisy because the bar is around the pool, which is 4-feet from our door. We had to keep the blinds closed or the bar people could see right in. Weird. Luckily the air-conditioning unit was really loud (in a good way) and drowned out the people noises. We slept really well. The unfortunate part is is that the website makes it look WAY cooler than it is. It looks like a groovy mid-century hotel (like the fabu Horizon in Palm Springs) that offers a chill time. Maybe lounge around the pool and kick back with a mai tai and some fondue. Re-reading their website after the fact, they do mention a \"spirited nightlife scene\" and that \"occasionally, the energetic buzz of good times can be heard in-room...\" and that, \"...care is taken to limit sound levels.\" Um, okay? I don't know if there's a college around there, or something, but this was basically a frat party. It's 20-somethings running a hotel and bar that caters to 20-somethings. Definitely go there if you A) want to be in Point Loma, B) like to party and be loud, C) are 21-30, D) get a rate of $160 or less, or 5) can sleep through noise. Overall a decent enough place.

Ha, ha) at this quaint boutique hotel. Now if you're looking for a tired business lounge with computers, etc. go to a boring businessy type of hotel, but if you are looking for something different & fun then read on! For me, The Pearl conjures up moods of old black & white Hollywood glamour, those cool now-famous collectible 1960's HIGGINS glassware pieces, thoughts of Frank Sinatra lounging like a lizard with a Cuban fatty, or images of Marilyn Monroe & Dorothy Dandrich wearing taboo fox fur shawls with the heads & paws still attached! (Sorry vegans). The only difference is that The Pearl has been beautifully updated without bastardizing or compromising the original 1960's design, architecture or flare! It is truly a Boutique Hotel in that it offers \"unusualities\" (my pet word for: unique or unusual amenities) that other hotels may not. For instance, they have a Movie Night! You can lounge, have a gourmet meal or go tapas style out by the pool, all while watching classic movies on a huge screen! Inside you'll find next to the concierge, a cool shag carpeted area with board games to play with. As well, they have an outdoor side patio with a Zen water fountain and a large table that would seat a nice-sized dinner party. The Pearl really almost has a home-like feel to it, because of the cozy floor plan layout. But I can't close without mentioning something my husband didn't even realize before taking me here...the food is excellent! They should really push to the public that they truly offer a full restaurant and bar! Plus if you have dinner, you can get a room (if you are not pre-booked) for a huge discounted price, if there is availability after a certain time (I think almost 50% off!!!). The menu is definitely impressive and tasty to boot! Our room was a corner room #9, I hear it is the owner's fav! Well, it's now ours too! It had cool, simple lines, airy, stylish colors and great tile/wallpaper design, not to mention a truly comfortable platform bed. I also loved the unexpected balcony just off the living room/tv area, where my husband & I enjoyed our early morning coffee overlooking the pool. Overall, I should be giving them a 9 score and that is only becuase they were still in construction at the time of our stay and they could use much brighter/visible signage, but I loved it so much that I'll go ahead and give them a perfect 10!!!

So I took my wife there as a belated birthday present. If you are a design buff, especially mid-century or modern, you get it. Some people just won't get it since there are numerous run of the mill roadside franchise hotels nearby. Its a wonderfully not-overdone restoration/modernization of a late 50's or early 60's hotel, with all the best parts preserved. At the front, its not immediately obvious that its different from its more modest neighbors. The first clue that this is something different is the valet service. Next is the upscale restaurant, in of itself unusual in an under 50 room hotel. The restaurant is very open-air and resort like, with seating spilling out around the pool; and with an architecturally blended movie screen over the pool on which mid-century classics are shown during evening hours (we saw 007 Dr. No). Dinner was long and liesurely, since the surroundings were so comfortable. We just didn't want to leave - not to mention that our room was just accross the pool. The room (#9 - \"The Strand\") was large with a sofa seating area large enough to be its own room, a wide plasma tv, and a balcony overlooking the pool. The bed was nice and firm, the sheets and bedding clean, the bathroom facilities large, modern and luxurious (what do you call those wide ceiling showerheads and separate handheld shower nozzles?). The design throughout is mid-century modern yet warm - about the best I've seen this genre done. What also amazed me was the great number of interesting spaces and amenities packed into a hotel of this size. Lots of lounges, board games, balconies, nooks, and items of visual interest - all in earth and water tones, giving a feeling of warmth. There are even beach cruiser bicycles for guest use. The staff was very friendly and attentive (and probably saved our two year old's life). The location is close to the harbor, and central to downtown, the beaches, and San Diego attractions. About the only complaint I had was unavoidable due to its newness - i.e., the fresh paint and carpet smell. Anyway, think the Dub-U or one of those hip little South Beach hotels - at about half the price, but for my money better.

Hairdryers are provided but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really provide hot air and are quite heavy. And lastly, 3 bugs!

We squashed it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no worries. A couple hours later I went into the rest room and saw what we initially thought was a 2 \u00c2\u00bd\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd long, black crack near the bathtub. Imagine our surprise when it started moving and we realized it was a caterpillar or another crawly like creature, which we laughed and disposed off ourselves. Later on I was blow-drying my hair when a cockroach ran behind the toilet and sink. Boyfriend took a picture of it with his cell phone and at this was pretty grossed out. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in various hotels together, ranging from an America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Best Value Inn ( wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even give it half a star) to the W, Hyatt, or Marriott chain. Have never, ever seen a bug \u00e2\u20ac\u201c let alone a cockroach. He called the front desk and the young lady was extremely apologetic and offered to move us \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but we were already running late for our dinner reservation and told her we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to stick it out. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t encounter anymore creepy crawleys and mentioned the complaint again at check out. Front desk was unable to comp us on our room since it was already paid thru cheaprooms.com but comp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d us our valet ($15 value). At best I would consider the hotel a step up from a good Motel 6. For $200 it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the in room amenities it should, bathroom also had chips in the floor tile, a long crack on the bathroom wall, and the bathtub drained really slowly.
