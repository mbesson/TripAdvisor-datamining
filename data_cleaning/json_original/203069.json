The hotel is situated very close to the Vatican.

Breakfast very poor compared to other NH Hotels: scrambled eggs, bacon, croissants, ham, salami, fruit, yogurt, cereals, tea and coffee from the dispenser, juices from the dispenser. The staff is quite unfriendly, do not smile, like most Italians working in hospitality services. Distance is 10 minutes walk from the Vatican, Piazza del Popoplo 5 minutes, where you can walk to Piazza Spain, Fontana di Trevi, Piazza Venezia, Piazza Navora, Coloseum and all the touristic atractions. Dobledecker rides are an alternative that are not so expensive compared to those in London or Paris. We chose Cristiana tour company. The price is 16 euros for two days, although in the brochure isn~t written.

The location is OK, in a quiet residential area, and at walking distance to Vatican and Piazza Navona. The first time I stayed I was put in a renovated room, which was very nice. I had heard about bed bugs, so I checked everything and can confirm there was no issue in my room. The second time I stayed, was a big surprise !!! I opened the door to find an old and smelly room the size of a closet !!! Had to put my suitcase sideways so it would fit between the twin bed and the wall !! Having the experience of the renovated room, I went back to the front desk and asked to be relocated. I was told so many different stories : 1. there was no other room available, and to come back the next day. to which I had to argue that some people from my company were leaving later that day, and for sure their rooms will be made available ! then I had the 2nd story : OK, you will have to wait after 16h00 (in 2 hours). I told the lady I would wait and handed her my NH fidelity card and suddenly a key for a renovated room appeared in my hand ! (...) . Being aware of that and having seen the huge difference in the quality of the rooms, I would not recommend this hotel to someone going on vacation, knowing there are chances that they will be given an old room and might not be able to change for a renovated room.

The next bus stop is just around the corner and a metro station in walking distance (5min.). When we checked in they had a major breakdown of the computer system. We had to come back in one hour (we used this time to go for lunch). For sure, it wasn't the best first impression of the staff; however, in the following days they were nice and helpful. Especially with insider tips they eased our stay. The hotel is a former Jolly Hotel which is remarkable in some corners. The room was rather small tough. I have seen bigger room Standart Rooms in NH Hotels (even in Italy - Bologna). The ammendities were available and always stuffed up and the bathroom cleaned perfectly. Since it is a popular hotel with tourists due to the proximity to the Vatican and also a crew hotel for major Northamerican airlines the restaurant was very packed during breakfast. We had to wait a little to get seated. The breakfast is included in the room price and offers a continental style breakfast. Especially the fresh juices were very welcomed by us. Other than that nothing really special, just a breakfast. You have WLAN just in the lobby. It says 30min only, but they are more than happy to give you 3-4 or more passwords.

The room was awfully small without anymore space for bags or suit cases. It is located in a quiet street but the hotel caters mostly to airline staff and pilots. So they don't care much for private travelers. There is no iron in the room. You have to go to the top floor to iron your clothes and the room is closed at 8:00 PM and opens only at 9:00 AM. The elevators is too small, almost like the size of a phone booth. The lobby is elegant but not the rooms. There is a timer for hair dryer and it over heats. The air conditioning is not strong enough for hot weather. The meals are expensive. Breakfast is various and quite good. The counter person who received us always spoke in Italian, while we asked the questions in English. The restaurant staff spoke only Italian so an English speaking guy would have to use sign language. Over all, I would not rate this hotel as 4 star.

We took it. Superior Rm (706), was acceptable, although very small. Air Con worked well, which was lucky, as it was VVV hot. 7th floor rear rooms have a view over rooftops, to green hillsides, which was pleasant, this floor also has small balconettes which other floors and front rooms don't have. Breakfast was good compared to other Italian offerings. Good selection continental with some hot bacon, scrambled eggs, sausages and mushrooms- All help yourself. We managed to find a swimming pool on 2nd day.... About 10 min walk. Walk down to Piazza Cavour to the river, and 'La Maison' is located on River lower path, adjacent to Castel Sant Angelo. 10Euro all day, including an excellent Calvin Klein Towel. Perfect to escape the heat and rest from site seeing! Apparently open mid June to Mid September. (I have added a photo of pool). Overall, I WOULD recommend this hotel based upon price.

The hotel is also fairly close to the Vatican, only about a 10 minute walk. To get there, just turn right when you exit the front of the hotel, turn left at the first street (which is about 50 feet from the front door), go one block and turn right which is the main street in the area.

We even had 2 bathrooms, one fully equipped for disabled use. It is only 10 minutes comfortable walk to the Vatican, even in 33 degrees of heat we had during our visit. The queues for St. Peter's were horrendous, but we managed to get straight in to the Vatican museums, although we were told we would have to queue.

Service and food quality were much above average and good value for the money. All in all, the hotel is very good value for the money (we had a special rate of just \u20ac 110.-- for bed and breakfast, all inclusive) given its four stars which it certainly deserves. We will certainly stay there again, when we come to Rome next time. Two small caveats: If you are in a hurry, do not take the elevaters which can take long time to wait for. Secondly, make sure that your English spoken requests or orders are properly understood, as not everybody at the reception desk seems to be very good at English.", "Date": "February 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midlands", "Title": "\u201cThe Jolly.\u201d", "Author": "fullerclarts", "ReviewID": "UR2589287", "Content": "We stayed at the Jolly for 4 nights in September 04.We were not able to get rooms on the same floor as our friends and our room was very small and smelt smokey.The bed was large and comfortable but the bathrom was also very small although the shower was powerfull and the water always hot.

Third...We were in a smoking room and the smoke alarm went off and an engineer came into our room and found nothing wrong and starting moaning...forth....it was 10pm and I asked the receptionist if she could book a taxi to visit a friend and she looked at us and said \"TAXI?? AT THIS TIME??\" Finally, when we checked out, they tried to charge us for drinks from the mini bar which we didn't use....I found the hotel staff really rude and unwilling to help except for two!

First, there was not enough space in the room to open 2 large suitcases. Second, the in-room safe didn't work -- the front desk said that was normal and that they didn't work in any of the rooms (despite this being listed as a hotel feature). On Easter Sunday, housekeeping used at least one of our toothbrushes to clean the drain (which we had left sticking out of the shaving kits on the sink to dry), i.e. the plastic was all scraped up and it was previously a brand new toothbrush. This was in spite of leaving a tip for the maid (of course this was the last one). The hotel manager said it was our word against housekeepings so nobody was going to get fired, but he did give us his apologies and a bottle of champagne (if we could we would have walked out after this 2nd night but we had prepaid and it was nonrefundable). Next, the rooms have no shower curtains so water gets all over the floor. Finally, on checkout, we were asked to pay for 2 bottles of water (7.5 Euros) when we hadn't consumed anything at all from the wet bar. The location was pretty convenient to a Metro station, the bed was comfortable enough, and the drains are pretty clean from all the toothbrushing, but we wouldn't stay there again.", "Date": "April 23, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oak Park, IL", "Title": "\u201cPoor customer service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1808971", "Content": "My daughter was studying in Italy and the hotel was in a good location to her apartment.
