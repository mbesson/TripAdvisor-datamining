The good points: the room was small, but nicely laid-out. The bathroom was a decent size, with marble and travertine floors and walls. The bed was comfortable, and the linens crisp. The television was a flat screen attached to the wall opposite the bed. The breakfast room was nice, and the lady running it was extremely pleasant and cheerful. The bad points: there was no ventilation whatsoever except for opening the window. The traffic noise was so loud with the window open that we could not hear television at all. There was a loud band playing on the street corner outside the hotel. The receptionist tried to get the a/c to turn on, but after multiple tries and a call to her boss, reported that the a/c could not be turned on because \"it's winter.\" We could not even get the fan to run. This was a very warm October day, and the room was quite hot. We had to open the window and also prop open the hallway door for about 2 hours to get the room to a bearable temperature. We closed it in order to sleep, and by morning the room was again uncomfortably warm. The bathroom had not been properly cleaned prior to our arrival: there was trash still in the wastebasket, and the toilet had not been cleaned. The vanity lights above the sink did not work, and also one light next to the bed did not work. The shower head was clogged, so the water sprayed out in various directions.

Our room was nice, I had concerns about the room being dark but we didn't find that to be the case. I liked the modern decoration of the hotel and our room. It seemed to us that they need to spend a little bit of money to bring the hotel back to it's original opening state. There just seemed to be quite a few little things that went wrong. The 1st floor elevator button was broken for a few days. The phones were out for a few days. Our shower didn't drain, you had to stop in the middle of the shower to avoid and overflow. The showerhead was blocked. The electricity didn't work in all of the plugs. There were burnt out lights in the room. Nothing major but enough to see that maintenance is needed. The front desk staff were excellent. They advised us of the best times to head to places, they recommended great restarurants and were very helpful with directions. The woman in charge of cleaning our room was great and super nice. I was sick one day and she wanted to make sure we had clean towels so she sent them up with my husband after breakfast. I highly recommed the breakfast, it's plentiful and good. Taking breakfast eliminates having to find it in the morning, one less thing to think of and it's great food. One note, they have quite a computer system at the hotel, very detailed and I felt uneasy about exactly what they can control from the front desk. They can tell if the bathroom door is locked from the front desk turn on/off the heat, regulate the room temperature, monitor the lights etc. It just made me a bit uncomfortable.

The breakfast on the 5th floor was always really nice. We went to the rooftop one night and had a bottle of wine and a little picnic up there. Highly recommend if you want to get away from the crowds. It was deserted. Also, the hotel is very quiet. We never heard people in rooms nearby. I only have 2 COMPLAINTS: 1. There is no WIFIi available which the hotel could definitely remedied very easily. 2. You have to climb a flight of stairs with your luggage to get to the front desk. It would be great, especially for elderly folks if they had you leave your luggage at the bottom and offered to bring it up for you. We didn't mind though since we were traveling pretty light.

My new wife and I just spent four days on our honeymoon at The Opera Hotel in September 2010, on the recommendation of close Roman friends. I speak good Italian and have traveled extensively in Italy, and have stayed in places ranging from fleabag hotels in Palermo to the Danieli in Venice. I also worked at a luxury hotel earlier in my career, so I know what standards are appropriate in nice hotels. The Opera Hotel does not charge expensive room rates, but its standards are definitely on the high end and it overachieves at pretty much everything. It is an exceptional value. At The Opera Hotel, the rooms and common areas were impeccably clean; the service was pleasant, prompt and discreet; the rooms were generously sized and very pleasantly appointed. The hotel is located on the Via Nazionale, a well traveled street close to pretty much all of Rome's attractions -- but the hotel rooms have double-paned glass so the rooms were extremely quiet. (I refer to \"rooms\" because we stayed in two different rooms, due to my own bungled scheduling of our dates....we changed rooms on the final night, so we were both on the 4th floor initially, and then on the 3rd floor). We slept with no interruptions of any kind. The rooms are all air-conditioned, which can be a life-saver in Rome even into the fall, when the heat and humidity can be high (especially for Americans who are used to A/C and expect it). The hotel could be described as a small, friendly, appealing boutique hotel -- with very attractive, modern, comfortable furnishings and ambiance. One of my pet peeves in Italian hotels in years past has been maids banging around in the hallways in the morning hours, presumably trying to arouse travelers to vacate their rooms so that maids can do their cleaning service in the rooms. This was NOT the case at The Opera, which was quiet throughout our stay. In fact, the hotel only has a few rooms per floor, and although the hotel was fully booked (hence our need to change rooms), I rarely heard or saw anyone in the hallways at all. The hotel serves breakfast on the 5th floor roof terrace, and this is a lovely place to start the day. There are cereal options, croissants, crostata di marmelata options, in addition to juice, coffee, tea and most anything else you would want in the morning. I am trying to think of some shortcomings to mention here....I can think of none. Our stay at the Opera Hotel was a pleasure all-around, and I intend to stay there the next time I get to Rome.", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cJust back from 7 night stay.

The room was comfortable, clean and spacious.

Each day we returned to superbly cleaned room. A fridge is in the room offering a minibar and we left our own drinks in here which caused no issues. Bathroom spacious with marble walk-in shower. A few things to mention, the hotel is situated on a main high street between shops, there is no signage on the front door so look for the flags above eye level. Room had excellent airconditioning, which actually proved too good after three days but it can be fully manually operated. Finally the key operates the power so if you need to charge items or you are in your room without the key the power goes off(except airconditioning and fridge). Staff very helpful. Website also links to Roman Candle Tours whom we used for private Vatican tour which was outstanding.

The Colloseum was about 10-15 minutes walk away, and all the gorgeous piazza's are a stones throw away. The only long walk was the Vatican and St Peters, but it was so close to every where else it was worth it. Its the kind of city to walk in as well so don't get taxis or coaches everywhere.

It is very new and we feel that we were lucky to have found it. The rooms look EXACTLY as the pictures on the website show them to look. Simple, sleek, and modern is the feel, which was nice for a busy stay in Rome. The reception attendants were very helpful and always tried to answer our questions. The maids were also very helpful and very good at their job! Breakfast in bed at no extra charge was a rare and wonderful pleasure. Their pastries were delicious, and the juices were great too. We loved the nuttella on the roll. We hadn't had that before. Our room had a great view of the busy...but not too busy street in front of the hotel. We were able to walk from Roma Termini to the hotel, but we should have gotten a cab since we had so much luggage. We found that the Opera Hotel was in a good position to walk all over, but we utilized the one day travel passes and hopped on and off metros and buses to save our poor little feet. Seeing Rome in two days and nights could be considered attempted suicide, but we made it...almost in one piece. The hotel has no pool, restaurant, etc. which isn't needed. Rome is so big, with so much to see that there really isn't time to hang out at the hotel anyway. If you disagree with that statement, then the Opera Hotel may not be for you, but I believe it is the perfect place to stay if it is a short stay for a first time visitor.

We were on the top floor (the fourth) and had a magnificent time. We had already stayed in 5 other hotels in Italy and this one was very beautiful and modern. I had the best sleep here! Down duvets and a king size bed - it was heaven! Lots of pillows as well - and they were nice too! I am glad I took the risk booking this despite the lack of reviews. As mentioned, there is no common area but it makes for a nice way to have breakfast - in your room. The service was punctual for breakfast, arriving at our door at the time we requested. The woman bringing the breakfast was very quick and friendly. She delivered the breakfast, put it down and literally ran out as to avoid disturbing us. It was a typical continental - nothing special - but it was breakfast nonetheless. For this matter - I wouldn't recommend coming to this hotel with young children. Also, there are stairs in the walkway coming into the hotel - so it woudn't be manageable with a wheelchair. There is an elevator, so if there are issues physically you don't have to walk to the top floor (although they are small - but that is typically European). The bathroom was beautiful although the shower situation was interesting. There was no shower curtain - only a partial glass -and with the shower head located directly in the middle of the shower area it was awkward to shower and wash hair without soaking the floor. But there was the towel warmer and a bidet. Lots of towels as well. Marble and new - it was just like the pictures you will find on Expedia. The view was nice - onto Via Natzionale and it was quiet despite the fact that it is a main street. There is a balcony but the doors are locked - I think - I couldn't get ours open. To work the safe you have to go to the lobby for the master to set your pin (which is personally changed by each person). Also, you will need to ask them to turn you Air Conditiong on upon acitvating you room. I would stay here again. We were able to set out at 11 in the morning - ltierally walking most of the main areas of Rome and right back to the hotel. From the hotel walking with our suitcases (on wheels) it took 14 minutes and from there the train goes right to the airport.

Only one working small bedlamp in the entire room and the safe did not work. The hallways were dark at night which is extremely dangerous and there was not a peep hole to check who is outside. Worst of all was the bathroom. The pictures on the website made it seem like there was an enclosed tub or at least a shower curtain. Not so. There was a shower head pretty much over the toilet so the entire bathroom became immersed in water with every shower. When asked to switch rooms, I was told they were \"working on it\". Yup, still working on it up until my check out. This was a two star experience at best and you are better off at a hostel. If you want a great hotel, stay at the Aleph in Rome. It is pricey, but I was wishing I had just paid that money to ensure a truly delightful stay in Rome. I wrote a review about the Aleph for my stay in May 2003. Check it out.
