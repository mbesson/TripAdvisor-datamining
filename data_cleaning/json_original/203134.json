The hotel is quite normal, nothing special but we wanted a center acommodation to move easily through the city. The rooms although basics, were OK, confortable beds, perfectly clean bathrooms and the maid was very attentive with the cleanliness and order. The breakfast room is quite pretty because is a covered terrace. The breakfast is wide and rich for being for a three star hotel (eggs, sausages, bacon, toast, cereals, fruits, nutella, buscuits, juices, croissants and yogurts). With this breakfast is enough to give you energy for the day! The waiter was very polite and kind. The elevator is small but works perfect during all our stay. We had no problems as it is written in another reviews. Our rooms faced the street so was quite noisy during the night due to the traffic, but fortunately we could sleep perfectly because we were very tired to walk all the day. But maybe you could bring with yourself earplugs, just in case. Suming up, I totally recommend this hotel because the location is the must (one minute walking to the Fontana di Trevi or five to the Panteon square) and its value for money. Of course, do not expect any luxury but... who wants luxury in a hotel in Rome with such a wonderful city?

Overall our stay was brilliant, Rome is a beautiful city and I would recommend a visit to everyone! First for the bad points (there were not many, but lets get them out of the way!) The rooms were not what you would call sound proof! I think it was more the fact that our room was located over a very busy road, at night the constant sirens and traffic could make it difficult to sleep, it was pretty noisy, but to me only a minor problem. I also found that you could hear people in other rooms even if they were just talking, again not a huge problem for me but if you really value your sleep maybe consider staying in a quieter area... Not really a bad point about the hotel but do beware of the driving! Be extremely careful when crossing the roads as the italians do not necessarily stop at crossings and will drive around you even if your in the middle of the road! (they say the best way to cross is to step out boldly!) Now for the good :) We stayed in a superior room and I would recommend paying the extra for one as they were considerably better than the basic room. The beds were comfortable, room was cleaned daily and the minibar was a nice touch (albeit expensive at 3.50EURO for a can of soda) The location of the hotel itself was fantastic! everything was within comfortable walking distance (Vatican city around 30 minutes, colloseum 20 minutes) and the trevi fountain was just 5 minutes away which was lovely! for location this hotel definitely gets a 10 out of 10! The staff in the hotel spoke perfect English and were very friendly and happy to help with any queries. The breakfast was pretty good, although if your someone expecting a full english/american breakfast you will be disappointed, the breakfast is minimal although there is a lovely selection of coffee and fresh cakes. And the view from breakfast is just lovely. There is no lunch or dinner facility but there is a cafe in the sister hotel (accademia) which is just 2 minutes away! Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again, its the perfect base for all the sightseeing! A few tips! Like any other city be aware of pickpocketers, particularly around tourist traps like the trevi fountain, women should also wear cross body bags just to be on the safe side. A cab from the airport should be no more than 45EURO so don't get conned! When visiting the colloseum wear comfortable shoes because all them stairs can be hard on your feet! I would reccomend an open top bus tour, that way you see everything! Be aware that it can be quite pricey, but there are good value restaurants so always read the menu prices before you go in! The Hard Rock cafe is just a 10 minute walk away and is fantastic although not traditional! You get alot of street sellers (generally perfectly nice people) roses, toys, pictures etc, be polite but firm with them otherwise they won't leave you alone! The shops in Rome are fantastic so don't leave without participating in a bit of retail therapy! I visited in January and the weather was fine for sightseeing, quite cold but bright! Try to avoid the summer because Ive heard its stiflingly hot and not ideal for walking around!", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Town, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cA taste of Olde Style Hospitality\u201d", "Author": "Cleopatra030", "ReviewID": "UR90957943", "Content": "I absolutely enjoyed the quantness of this small hotel, situated around the corner from the Trevi Fountain.

We hadn't been organised and booked this last min on the day. The location was perfect, right around the corner from the Trevi fountain and on same road as tour buses etc. The hotel however, was well overpriced for what it had to offer (\u00a3200+ per night). Upon entering this small hotel, you are greeted with a flight of stairs and at the time there was no porter to help us up with our luggage. The gentleman on reception was austere and did not rush to serve us, although he was helpful in terms of trains and further information, speaking fluent english. The lift/elevator was very old and tiny, I avoided using it. We were on the first floor in one of the modernised rooms. It was on the small side, although adequate. The rooms were modern with wood and tiles, however, they were very clinical. The bathroom was lovely and modern, althought the shower was tiny, so small, my husband couldn't close the shower cubicle door. The sink had a drainage problem in our room (room 102). There was a music system and lighting control panel above the bed which was a nice touch and I see other reviews on here that liked that, however, we couldn't get the music function to work (not sure if the fault was ours or that particular room). Our room had a small balcony off of it which was a nice touch. My biggest complaint however, was the bed. It was two singles pushed together to make up a (rather small) double and honestly, it was the hardest bed I have ever experienced in my enitre life. The bed could double as a table if you wanted it to, it was rock solid! I was convinced it was just an upholstered bed base with no mattress on, until I checked. And the pillows were flat as pancakes. Very uncomfortable night's sleep for both of us. Also, we could hear doors being closed/slammed in the corridor and movements in the hall way which woke us up early in the morning. Having said that, if you like the location, don't mind average service and are after modern clinical rooms with extremely hard beds, then I would recommend this hotel. But make sure you get a better price then we did. The breakfast was nice, although avoid the horrible orange squash.

Either that or the water leaking onto the floor from the bathroom ceiling or blood stained mattresses. Either one or the other, I can't decide. The air conditioner did not work and the thermostat shocked me when I touched it. Every morning I woke with a pain in my back. When the thermostat started sparking into the room (in all seriousness) we called for maintenance and after 45 minutes and three more calls the repairman arrived but would not fix the problem without another call to hotel management. He actually tried to convince us that he had indeed solved the problem multiple times but it was clear after our multiple complaints to management that he just did not want to get into the ceiling and actually fix the problem, providing the luxury let alone the safety that $450 a night should pay for. My wife and I asked for a queen bed, but found that we actually were given 2 cots pushed together. My sister who came with us was promised a cot, but got a very small broken pullout with what we can only assume was a blood stain. Our sheets were never cleaned during the entirety of our stay despite requests. We were also followed into the hotel by a man in the evening and the hotel offered no security to alleviate the situation. Instead, they allowed him to follow us. We evaded him by switching floors on the elevator a couple of times. Our card keys to the room didn't work, we had to have it replaced several times and by the end of our stay they had quit working all together. A call to the front desk did not solve the problem, I was told they were to busy to deal with our situation, but when I had gone down the girl behind the counter I spoke to was alone and literally playing an online video game called \"Vampire Wars.\" The same happened when I wanted to know how much the water was in the refrigerator. I asked the price and she told me to come down and check for myself. She was again too busy playing \"Vampire Wars.\" The room was overall very gross and disgusting. The walls were padded and VERY dirty, as were the curtains. The floor in our room was VERY stained and had obviously been in need of a vacuuming for maybe the past six months. Both the Sink and tub did not drain, and when you flushed the toilet water and excrement would splash out onto the floor mixing with the water already dripping from the ceiling.

I would say this is the only advantage of this hotel. As for the rest, pretty terrible. They put me in room 201, horrible bedroom, old and smelly. Bed was old. Furniture also very old. The worst was probably the window would not close properly and I was waken up every morning around 6 by the dustman. Hotel was clean on the other hand which is a good point. Breakfast average but great view on the top floor of the building. Room service is non existing, they have no iron or iron board at guests disposal which is not acceptable.

I had booked two rooms, both of which had been refurbished and were of a very high standard. The bedding and towels were immaculate as was the room and infact the whole hotel. The breakfast was plentiful with a wide variety of items to suit every taste.

The Trevi Fountain was 2 mins away and all the other sights within walking distance. Staff were friendly, brekkie was lovely, room was cleaned everyday. Shower was great although the cublicle was tiny (if you're a large person it would be VERY hard to sqeeze into it). I would recommnend this hotel if you didnt want anything too plush.

We enjoyed the selection of music so much (instrumental with a decidely international flavor) that we are requesting the source from the hotel. They have a small, flat screen tv that, I believe, comes with computer ports in the room. The wood paneling used was very striking along with the sleek, stainless steel lamps. The best floor to stay on currently is the 4th floor as we did. The breakfast room is down the hall from the 5th floor rooms. The breakfast room is a glass terrace with a nice view while you are eating. The bathroom was very comfortable and modernized as well. You are around the corner from the Trevi Fountain.
