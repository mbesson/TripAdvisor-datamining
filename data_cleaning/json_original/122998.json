Being a Seattle native and UW alum, I've wanted to try the College Inn for years. I was thus so very inclined to like this place -- but came away with a combination of anger, disappointment, and the decision not to return. Here's why: --This place is not clean where it matters. The blanket on my bed STANK of some other person's perfume or deoderant -- very distinctive, not an aftersmell of detergent. If they wash the blankets at all, they don't do a very good job. --The shower drain was badly plugged up, so that within a few seconds I was standing in my own wastewater, which, of course, then sloshes together with the remains of other people's showers -- ugh, I don't want to go on thinking about that.... --I was promised a double room and received a twin room (two twin beds). This was after having booked well ahead of time and getting both a phone and email confirmation of this. They were completely full and since we were staying for only one night, I have a strong suspicion that we were given whatever was left over. I also know that they had switched rooms on us at some late point b/c I had received a call from Chris, the manager, giving me the room number and telling me that since we were arriving late in the p.m. to get buzzed up and just go straight to that room which would be unlocked. On arrival I found that the door was locked (I probably disturbed whoever was there by trying the knob), and I had to buzz the staff who live upstairs to let me into the room that they had set aside for me -- a different one from what I was originally promised. --The next morning, when I mentioned the room switch, the manager did not at all appear surprised or concerned. He said that it should not have happened but his statement that it \"shouldn't\" happen again was not at all convincing. --Website is dishonest: under Parking it says, \"Saturday and Sunday free parking one-half block away on a space-available basis.\" When I called to get directions to this free parking area I was told that it is between 42nd and 43rd on Brooklyn -- which is more like 5 blocks away from the inn. We're walkers, so NBD, but this seems to me to be indicative of a tendency to paint a rosier picture than what actually exists. --Having had a difficult day of travel and getting only 5 hours of sleep, the next morning I made the error of leaving a clothing item in the room. Two days later, I realize that it is missing and I work hard to follow up with the staff there to locate it. I leave a message, call back when I don't get the courtesy of a return call, stop by in person to inquire, speak with \"Joe\" (I think that was his name) as well as Dean. I get a couple of assurances that I will receive a call back -- they say they have to check with housekeeping. Even with my repeated calls, including an angry final call that got me the assurance that Chris would call me back the next day, nobody ever bothered to phone me, even to tell me that the item went missing. My guess is that this has happened before, so no big deal from their perspective, and that in my case the housekeeping staff knew someone who could use my clothing item. The only positive comment I will make is a heartfelt one -- but it isn't about the Inn, it's about the College Inn Pub downstairs. The place is friendly and has an excellent choice of ales.

We already knew that it was a dorm-style establishment with a shared bathroom down the hall, so we came prepared with our own robes and shower shoes. Our major problem with the Inn was that my husband had been told when he made the reservation that it would be possible to check in before 3 p.m. The website states that no one is in the office until then and the front door is locked; visitors must be buzzed in to check in and are then given a key to the front door. As I said, we were told that they could make arrangements for us to check in early. We arrived at the Inn around 12:30 p.m., luggage in tow and exhausted, only to find that no one was there. We tried buzzing and calling but there was no answer. We drug our luggage into the tiny cafe downstairs and had a bite to eat and then sat on a bench for a while until we saw someone inside the entryway to the Inn. Lucky for us that we saw them, as we were allowed to stow our luggage in the office for a few hours, but we still couldn't check in until 3 p.m. I understand that that is their stated policy, but they should not have told us that we could get in earlier if it wasn't true. So be warned, do not expect to get into the building before 3 p.m., no matter what they tell you!!! My only other gripes with the Inn were minor. While there was a small chest of drawers in our room, there were very few hangers and no closet. They could definitely stand to have some more hangers available. Also, there is one shared ironing board and iron that is kept upstairs; you have to go up to the 4th floor lounge/office and ask for it. The iron was ancient and completely empty. The room itself, however, was fine. The bed was no more or less comfortable than any other standard hotel bed. The sink in the room was definitely helpful, since the bathroom down the hall could get a little crowded depending on the time of day. The continental breakfast was great, definitely better than any standard breakfast at a major hotel chain. And from what I saw, the staff was very helpful in assisting travelers navigate their way around the city or suggesting things to see. We heard other travelers complaining about noise, but we didn't experience any of the problems with loud neighbors or noise from the pub downstairs. For our needs, the College Inn served us well.

Probably the most important question: Would we stay there again? Lordy, I hope not, but if you need a cheap room in a safe area and can swing with the issues that I have mentioned, it is a very acceptable place.

I felt sick in the am the next two days. When I approached her about this , she didnt want to accomodate me. I moved again to the third floor after two nights in that room because she needed the room for someone else. This new room on the third floor had one double bed so I moved all my stuff again to the third floor. Now I just wanted a little holiday in Seattle. The room on the third floor was 313. It too had problems because it was so noisy. Outside the room was a some type of fan which was so loud. It was so difficult to sleep. One good thing about this place was the continental breakfast although you have to walk a one or two flights of stairs depends on which floor you stay on. I enjoyed the fruit, toast, bagels, and cream cheese breakfast.

The College Inn is advertised on the University of Washington orientation brochure. Although it is the least expensive listed hotel, I had no reason to believe my stay would be problematic. I did not look up the website on-line, instead I called for reservations. I also called again to check the reservation. I arrived from the east coast to Seattle on a Sunday and drove to the College Inn. After walking up one horrendous flight of stairs, with more to follow, because the office is on the top floor of the establishment, I found that my son had arrived first and checked in. I was horrified to find out that the management's idea of not being able to accomodate anyone with disabilities meant if you can't climb 4 flights of stairs, maybe you shouldn't stay there. That fact isn't mentioned on the brochure or on the website, I did check the websites after the fact and vital information is omitted. I had requested a room with 2 beds as my son and I were together. The room was over the pub. The furnishing, in I think room 303,lacked any charm and looked like the set of a bad movie. I immediately went to the management and requested another room. A peek into the open rooms on my walk to the fourth floor office established the fact that much nicer rooms existed. The desk person upon my request told me that he had nothing available other than a double. Now I made these reservation well in advance of my stay. Of course a double was unacceptable as I wasn't sleeping in the same bed as my grown son. The desk person stated that no other accomodation could be made. I went back to the room very upset. Due to the packed schedule we had for the next two days, I could not find another place; however, on Wednesday morning I did find another hotel and went to check out. I was told by the manager that I would be charged a 48 hour cancellation fee and I should understand that he was loosing money by me leaving the hotel early. I couldn't believe the man's audacity and I told him I wasn't paying the fee. He told me that I was told when I originally made the reservation. I told him I had no record of that in my notes. He insisted he told me, basically called me a liar and then he expressed that for me to leave was screwing him out of money. The fur flew then. I told him I would pay in cash for the time I was there and not to charge my account. He took my money and gave me a receipt. When I left the building I looked again at the receipt and realized that he was charging me the 48 hour cancellation fee and that he had an amount due on the receipt. I called him from the street, so I could re-enter the building and walked up the 4 flights of stairs. I found that he had charged my credit card and had no intention of giving me a receipt. I requested a receipt. I also brought to his attention that there is no written policy stating anything about a cancellation fee. Also when I arrived and asked for another room and he could not accomodate me, he was effectively on notice that I was completely dissatisfied with the room. I have contacted the Chamber of Commerce, the College Inn is not a member. I talked with the University office that publicizes the orientation brochure, and they were very concerned about the treatment I had received. And I will follow up with letters to the Better Business Bureau. The College Inn failed to inform me of its limitations, failed to give me a decent room and charged me a cancellation fee after failing to accomodate my request when I made the reservation and when I requested another room. I was called a liar and accused of screwing them over. I would not recommend the facility to anyone. There must be nicer bed and breakfast closer to the University of Washington.", "Date": "September 30, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, UK", "Title": "\u201cIf you're in Seattle - stay here\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1031388", "Content": "The College Inn was everything I'd been told it would be - clean, comfortable, surrounded by great places to visit (bars) and full of fantastic people - loved it!", "Date": "May 29, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cCozy place in the U district\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR644027", "Content": "The College Inn is a wonderful little B&B.
