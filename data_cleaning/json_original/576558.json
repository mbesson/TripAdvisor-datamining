We found a very good rate on one of the major hotel websites. All of the staff seemed friendly and spoke English well. The breakfast was above average, with all of the usuals including cereal meats and cheeses, breads and dessert cakes, boiled eggs, fruit, yogurt, and also mozzarella balls. There was a juice machine and the staff made coffee drinks to order. The room (320) was at the end of a hallway and was much larger and nicely appointed than I was expecting. Room access is by a magnetized card, and the front desk is open late. One time I arrived to a closed door, around 11pm, but a quick touch of the buzzer and the desk man arrived a few seconds later. I suppose this hotel is considered to be in the Termini area (about a 10 minute walk) but it did not seem seedy or uncomfortable in any way. They are plenty of restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk (the front desk recommended 3 to me). The windows are soundproofed and whenever I opened the window and leaned out, it was actually very quiet. It is close to both the Termini and Repubblica metro stops. The only concerns to note were 1) the tv control seemed particularly difficult to use. I think I actually deprogrammed it while trying to get it to work. Something about \"press tv\" to get local channels and \"press...\" to get international channels. Also the free wifi is provided through out of those freehotspot.com setups. It seemed that every 25 minutes or so, the service would disconnect and I would be given the screen to re-enter my password and username. I received a strong signal while sitting at the work desk, but when moving to a different part of the room, the signal was noticeably weaker.

We found it very easy to find, granted we did check out Google maps before going. We arrived in the early evening and the desk staff at that time was very friendly and helpful, showing us a map and letting us know where all the \"famous\" sights were. We really did not have any dealings with the day staff other than to say our hellos and good-byes. We were able to walk to all the major sights although, in fairness, some (St Peter's Basilica) were quite a distance away. If you are not big on walking, it would be very easy to go to the Termini station and take a metro to stops near where you want to go. There is a great, reasonably priced restaurant around the corner, as well as a grocery and convenience store. The hotel itself was clean, including our room which was well maintained. It is located across the street from a police station so, rightly or wrongly, we felt safe. We only had two issues with this hotel. First was the water pressure in the shower/bath. If it is important for you to have a good, strong, hot shower then this is not the room (place?) for you. We were on the fourth floor and, at best, the water was very warm, and the pressure was (extremely) minimal. Our daughter was able to have a warm-ish bath, but only after a very long wait for the water to trickle into the tub. The second issue was that each morning, at breakfast, we had to ask for the trays to be refilled as they would sit empty until you did. Having said that, the wait staff were extremely nice and quick to bring us coffee as soon as we arrived. For us it was a shame about those two issues as, despite the fact that we liked the hotel in general, and thought the location quite ok, we would probably do another investigation / search for a different hotel if we went back to Rome. Not sure we would return here but might.

Having stayed in Italian hotels previously, this is one of the best 3* hotels I ever stayed at, considering Italian standards. The hotel is a 5-10 minutes walk away from the Termini station, thus very centrally and also conveniently located. Despite its central location, the street of hotel is pretty quiet and the windows are so extremely well isolated that one does not hear any cars passing by which guarantees for a very good sleep. Some of the sights can be reached by foot, such as for example the Spanish steps, which are only a 15 minutes walk away...similarly the Fontana di Trevi. A supermarket is located close by the hotel, just down the street. The hotel itself is pretty, the rooms appear new and they are neatly designed. The size of a double room is just right, the bathroom is spacy, though the only downside is the lack of room for toileteries in the bathroom itself. But that was about the only negative of staying in that hotel. The rooms are cleaned daily. New towels are provided daily. The personnel of the hotel, whether that is the reception, the breakfast room or the cleaning lady are very friendly. Especially, the reception is extremely helpful and can answer all questions especially in guiding you to the various sights or which public transportation to take etc. The breakfast is very much Italian style, i.e. do not expect a luxurious buffet. There is a selection of white bread, croissants and toast, jam, cheese, salami, cake and cornflakes.

Fairly large supermarket at one end of street good for stocking up as able to store items in hotel room mini bar. Initial contact with hotel via email and they were most helpful. On arrival a member of grou[p was unwell and reception staff with very nice and helped us any way they could. I travelled as 3 friends and were given 1 single room and 2 doubles for single use. Single room was small but spotlessley clean as was whole hotel. Doubles were extremely spacious and all equiped with mini bar, free safe, ample storage, tv, bath/shower, toiletries. For 3* in Rome very good. Only slight issue was single room toilet would not flush but maid got it working and showed us this but next day wouldn't work again! Breakfast fairly simple continental with cereals, fruit, yoghurts, bread/rolls, juice/tea/coffee, pastries and processed cheeses (no meats) but very nice and well stocked all morning (7am-10am). Hotel has free internet access, free tea/coffee all day in reception, lift but no bar and no problem to leave suitcases on check in/out day. Also small toilet area used to get changed in before late transfer back to airport. Altogether very good hotel, pleasant area, helpful staff and spotless! Very good rates available through bookassist.com (approx 60/65 euro per room per night) with small deposit payable on booking and balance direct to hotel at end of stay.

The rooms arent huge but are more than sufficient, with air con and safe (both of which are free). The breakfast is excellent with Coffee and Juices, Bread, cheeses and Eggs, plus cereals and cakes, and the free internet setup is also brilliant. The location is quiet but not hostile and there are several small and well priced restaurants dotted in the streets around the hotel, all offering a 2 course meal plus wine for 30 euros (per couple). The whole city is superb and with so much to see you need somewhere thats easy to come back to and crash out in after a long days walking - this certainly ticks all the boxes. One thing that i would tell people to be careful of are the Roman Centurions. Be firm and say no if they ask for a photo, we lost out on 40 euros due to one group taking just 4 pictures! A few other key points for first time visitors to rome. If you arrive at Ciampino airport use terravision coaches to get to the city centre - cheap and efficient. The cost of the Vatican was 14 euros each - do not believe them when they tell you the queues are long its rubbish. Dress code rumours are true though, covered shoulders and appropriate shorts/skirts. The Colloseum is 12 euros each - queue was longer but still only 30 minutes.

I had booked another hotel previously...Hotel Lirico...but I had some trouble with this (read my review on Hotel Lirico, Rome). Anyway, we flew from Liverpool to Ciampino, where we got an airport coach (Terravision) to the main station in Rome, Termini Station. This cost us \u00a310 each return but there are other airport shuttle services offering cheaper prices. From the station the hotel is a two minute walk. Unfortunately, we got ripped off by a taxi man who charged us 20 euros to get there by car, as we didn't know how close the hotel was. Warning! It is easier to walk, it is literally two streets away, so print out a map from Termini to Hotel Camelia before you go. We arrived at the hotel to find friendly staff, and we were pleased that the hotel is right opposite a police station, which made us feel safer, and a big supermarket at the end of the street (you can see this as you turn left out of the hotel doors). This was good to know, we picked up a few snacks and some toiletries from here. They sell everything you need. The room, although not huge, was spotless with modern furnishings. The bathroom was spotless. We had a hairdryer, safe, minibar, TV, two wardrobes and large double bed. The bed was huge and very comfy! They give you a key-card to get in, it felt very posh! Plus this meant we didn't have to lug a big key around everywhere we went. They have a lift, which was convenient for our heavy bags. The rooms were cleaned every day, the bed was made and fresh towels given (you just leave the towels on the floor if you want fresh ones). The mini bar was very reasonably priced, our mini bar bill was only 4 euros 50 when we left. Though this was partly because we bought drinks from the supermarket down the road! After reading the reviews on this site about the continental breakfast we thought it would be awful. It was actually lovely! And we looked forward to it every morning. It is served from 7 til 10am and the last day we didn't get downstairs til half 9 and there was still plenty left, it looked as though it had hardly been touched. This free breakfast was topped off nicely with the hot drinks having been brought to our tables by the waitor. They had a variety of hot drinks to choose from, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, cappuccino, hot milk etc. They also had fresh juice to help yourself to. The breakfast included fruit, croissants, bread, eggs, muesli, cereal, jam, fruit and lots more, we were spoilt for choice. There was a computer in the lobby where you can use the internet for free. I didn't have to wait to use it once, I just jumped straight on. The receptionists were all lovely, they helped us plan our sight seeing and gave us a map. We booked an open-top tour around rome for the last two days. We paid 25 euros each for 48 hours hop-on hop-off service. The bus takes you round all the main sites and you just jump off when you feel like it, then when you're done you wait for the next bus. They usually stop every 20 mins at each stop, traffic permitting. We went with Green Line Tours, but we noticed at least two other services and some were cheaper. You get free headphones that plug in by the seats on the bus, and you get a taped audioguide as you travel around the sites. The first day we were there we walked to the collosseum and roman forum. We found them by accident! They're not far away, and we're both smokers so we're not exactly fit. The national museum of rome is also round the corner opposite termini station. We got discounts at the attractions because we were from the EU and were 18-24 years old. We just showed our driving licenses. I also got a discount at the vatican museum and sistine chapel with my student card. So don't forget to take some ID! It can be as big as 50% discount at some places! I would like to warn people away from the tours for the colleseum and roman forum. We were told that we could pay 18 euros for entry and a full tour without having to wait in the queue, they told us we would get no information once inside. We decided against it, queued up for 5 mins at the most, paid 7 euros 50 to get in with our discount and they also had audioguides for 4 euros 50. But to be honest, if you go on the internet and find out about the sites beforehand you don't need a guide at all! Obviously, the tour operators want to make money out of you so beware! Also, beware of the various people trying to sell you things. They are quite forward and we were grabbed a couple of times, we were almost forced to pay 10 euros for a piece of string that went round our wrists! Thankfully I managed to sweet talk the guy but he got quite irate when I didn't want to buy his bracelet! Obviously because we went in November the attractions weren't too packed but I can imagine they are quite busy in the summer, so be prepared for queues. Anyway, back on to the hotel! All in all it was nice to have a descent place to come back to at the end of the night. The surrounding area wasn't too scary at night either! The only downfall is that we booked bed and breakfast only, so we had to find our own food come evening. But the sister hotel Art Deco is round the corner from Camelia, even though this is relatively expensive compared to the other restaurants in the area. There were several other restaurants and pizzerias, some did take-out as well. There were tabacconists on virtually very street, and there is a cash machine just past the supermarket. If you are unsure, they have all this at Termini Station. Oh and there are McDonalds' EVERYWHERE! (in case you get stuck for food!)

I paid online via their website before we went, but you can pay on arrival. I think it was 7 euros each. We had a superb time in Rome. It was a lovely break, and I think 3 nights/4 days was just the right amount of time. We found the easiest way to get around was on/off the metro which stopped at all the sites. The colosseum and vatican are a must see. We paid extra outside to queue jump and have a tour of the collosseum which was well worth it. I cant understand other reviews that say the hotel wasnt clean - as it was completely spotless.

As it turned out, she was incorrect. Of another desk clerk, I asked about the cab I could take directly to the airport. He said he didn't know what I was referring to. To be specific, he said, \"I don't know.\" He advised me to talk with one of his co-workers. Ironically, this clerk, the second I interacted with, was the one on deck the morning I left. When I spoke with the third clerk, he told me the service would cost 60 Euro. It ended up only costing me 40. On my final full day, I really needed to make a call to American Express. The phone in my room was not functioning properly, and there was no other staff to assist me.

But, a visitor may have some difficulty if they need to know something from a front desk clerk. To be fair, I had an equal number of examples in which the above employees gave me great assistance. In addition, their knowledge of English is as good as my knowledge of Italian. So I can't fault them much. Overall, I enjoyed staying at this hotel. But I won't stay there again due to the size of the shower. Also, my experiences with the staff has prompted me to expand my knowledge of Italian.", "Date": "April 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cvery nice hotel at a good price value.\u201d", "Author": "katerinaAthens", "ReviewID": "UR7251800", "Content": "We have just returned from our 5 days trip to ROME. We stayed at hotel ''CAMELIA'' which we fourd it very nice and at a good price. The hotel is at via Goito (PIAZZA INDIPENDENZA), a nice, peacefull and easy accessible street in the centre not far away from Termini station. By walk is approx. 1O minutes away. If you don't want to walk, there is a bus station almost outside of the hotel, the bus line is (38), that takes you to Termini station. Hotel staff is very gentle and very helpfull. Rooms are renovated recently (not so big not so small) and that is shows.It Iis well cleaned every day, with new towels etc. The room is very pretty with nice curtains, nice bedroom sheets, and a very nice bathroom. It has TV, Mini fridge, a hair druyer and very good air-condition. The breakfast was a small buffet, fine with croissants, marmelades, eggs, coffee, tea. Although we would prefer if it had ham and cheece. Nevertheless, everything was fine. We enjoyed very much our stay. We booked the room throughOCTOPUS TRAVEL, and we couldn't beleive our eyes. It was very good for a 3 star hotel. ROME is a very interesting city which offers you so much. You have so many things to see that 5 days is not enough. Although we walked everyday at least 7-8 hours. A suggestion: buy a card for 6 days that is for all transport(TRAINS, BUSES, ETC). It is cheap...And another suggestion: don't miss VILLA BORGHESE,(BORGHESE GARDENS), the historical centre (COLOSSEUM, PANTHEON, CIRCO MAXIMO), and if you have spair days go to Tivoli, to Villa D'ESTE.... It is absolutely fabulous...Don't miss drinking cappuchino con chocolata in cafe greco and in other cafes around the beautifull piazzas. And don't miss tiramissou and gelato especially in casa del freddo. A good suggestion for lunch is ARMANDO in VIA TIBURTINA. Very nice. That's all. Hope to be helpfull.

I need not have worried - the hotel was ideally located, being 5 minutes walk from the Termini station and within reasonable walking distance of all the main tourist sites (except the Vatican which was easily accessible by the number 64 bus).
