I have previousy stayed at the Royal Magda Etoile but chose to stay here because of reviews on trip advisor, and as Royal Magda was booked out. The room was very clean, and a good size by Paris standards. It had all the necessities. The bathroom was also nicer compared to the Royal Magda ( sorry but I have only stayed in these two hotels so far, when I return to Paris I will try another different hotel just to compare). We had a lovely little window which looked over the courtyard. It was quiet and good for sleeping. The hotel was easy to get to/from Metro, and also around the corner is Monoprix Supermarket for drinks etc...also nearby is Galleries Lafayette and Printemps department stores. Galleries have a great Gourmet Foodhall and wines to purchase to drink. Walking distance to the Louvre and Champs Elysee about 15-20 minutes. But if you are someone who doesn't like walking then you may choose elsewhere. But Paris is a beautiful city to walk around and discovering new shops and cafes is best done by walking all over and the backstreets. There is a lack of restaurants around the hotel but we were happy to walk and eat elsewhere and return to the hotel for a quiet and restful sleep. The room across from us had their own balcony and patio to have drinks. Very quaint and pretty place.

Minibar prices are smaller than in other hotels I have stayed in France. 2) HOTEL - very nice hotel, very new, with a nice lobby with a wonderful design that gets you into the \"Paris\" mood. 3) STAFF - extremly friendly staff. They offered immediately to help us with the sorroundings, the best places to visit in Paris and they are at your disposal at any time. 4) LOCATION - PERFECT! Situated 50 m away from Haussman Boulevard close to the biggest shopping area in Paris, 10 minutes walk to the Arc of Trioumph, 5 minutes walk to Champs Elyssee, 2 minutes walk to 2 metro stations.

Overall, a solid hotel. The room was nice though it was small. From researching other hotels for this visit this seems to be fairly standard for Paris, but I wont lie, I was a little disappointed at the size of the room when we first opened the door especially for the price (approximately $220/usd per night). However, this is a minor complaint, the rooms were clean, nicely decorated with a comfortable bed and a nice bathroom. The room had free in-room wifi access though it was a bit annoying to have to always re-sign in to the wi-fi service, a small complaint, sure, but what can I say I have high tech expectations. Our favorite part of the hotel was the staff. They helped me with all of our questions whether it was for suggestions food dining, helping us map out our daily itinerary or simply answering our various questions about life in Paris. The location was visually stunning and as good as any for touristy stuff. The hotel is located between two subway stations accessible in less than 5 minutes by foot allowing you to get around the city fairly easily. It took us a little more than 10 minutes to walk to the Champs de elysee and to the Madeline districts. The only caution I would offer is that the immediate neighborhood shuts down fairly early and completely shuts down on Sunday. Not that big of a deal if you are jumping around the city but I could see where it might be a little frustrating if you just want to walk to get a quick bite to eat.

The location of the hotel was not great, with few eateries in the vicinity, but I was aware of that from reviews I had read prior to booking. The tariff was quite high but as I was travelling alone, I wanted a hotel where I would feel relaxed and happy to spend time. Initially I was delighted with my choice. My room was small but beautiful. The bathroom was lovely and the cleanliness of the accommodation excellent. The decor of the hotel overall was very pleasing and I found the one member of staff on duty to be courteous and pleasant. I slept badly however, because I was cold and the following day the weather was so bad that I returned to the hotel mid afternoon to warm up and rest prior to looking for somewhere to eat that evening. I was so cold in my room that I had to get into bed with my clothes on and all the bedding I could lay my hands on simply to watch T.V. By evening I felt quite ill with cold and unable to venture out into the rain for supper, so went downstairs to speak to the receptionist ( I speak French so at no point was there any failure in communication). I was told that there was a problem with the central heating system and it would be rectified as soon as possible. No food was available but he could make me a pot of tea. ( 5 euros was added to my bill). The heating was not re-instated until my third and last night there. When I paid my bill that evening to a different solitary member of staff, I asked if a small reduction might be made to compensate for the extreme discomfort I had experienced due to the breakdown of the heating system. To my great irritation I was told that the malfunction had only affected the part of the hotel that I had been accommodated in and that his colleague could have moved me to another room! No reduction was made however. A short time after my visit I decided to write to the hotel and explain my dissatisfaction and request a small recompense. A letter and two emails later I finally received a short, unapologetic refusal. The cost of the three nights at Arioso was equal to two weeks wages to me, I felt very badly done by indeed.

I have only ever stayed with relatives in their apartments or in pokey 2 star hotels so I had made this selection as carefully as I could, using a 'luxury, design hotels' specialist website...hmmmm. Disappointing indeed! The room was the size of a cupboard!!!! Due to some other issues with the room we were rapidly 'upgraded' to another marginally larger room on the floor above, which was kind of the helpful receptionist. This time it had a street facing window which was something but the bed was huge and took up the entire room, we had to squeeze sideways to get between the desk and the bed and it wasn't possible to open cupboard doors completely. The Arioso claims 4 stars but it is clearly a sneaky 3 star kidding itself. Later I found that the 4 star rating by France Toursime can simply mean that the hotel has a lift! This hotel is okay but it is by no means 'designer cool' as I was led to believe. Its location is close to a metro station which is very helpful as there are few restaurants around. If you stay here, do your research on where to eat as there are several over-priced tourist trap bistros on Blvd Haussmann and Rue Boetie (yuk!). Breakfast is expensive and very ordinary. Even by Paris standards, this place is pokey. Perhaps the upstairs premium rooms are better but I'll be seeking out a true 4 star next time and not a pretender.", "Date": "August 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rockies", "Title": "\u201cParis Gem - walking distance to everything\u201d", "Author": "MoxieMT", "ReviewID": "UR8511985", "Content": "Only in Paris for a couple of days, the Arioso helped us make the most our time.

The hotel was full of charm and kindness. It was truly a wonderful Parisian experience. Yes, it was on the small side, but rather than seeing this as a negative, I prefer to look at it as quaint. The room was small but quiet. The cleanliness was exquisite and brought a feeling of luxury. The location was great, easy to the metro and all sight seeing spots. The hotel employees were gracious, sweet, and kind. They were all amazing. We booked our room with a special and it came with breakfast which was perfectly european. I only wish that I could sit in that beautiful room each morning for breakfast. The day we left, we had to leave quite early. The gentleman working the night shift knew this as he arranged our taxi. When we made our way downstairs he had set up a breakfast special for my mother and I in the sitting room. It was truly wonder and he without a doubt went above and beyond.
