We found it to be small but clean, the breakfast was great, and the location ideal. When we booked another trip for the spring of 2012 we again chose this hotel. BIG MISTAKE!!! We reserved two rooms, a double for my wife and me and a triple for our three teenage boys. Upon arriving at the hotel I was told the toilet in the triple room was not working but we could have two doubles. Obviously this isn't going to work since we have five people. We ended up getting two doubles and a single so, for the moment, crisis averted. I asked the girl what time breakfast would be served in the morning and she told me there isn't breakfast because the kitchen flooded last week. I explained to her it was going to cost me an additional \u00a335 to feed my family breakfast each day. She offered to knock off \u00a35/day but only on the second and third nights we were staying. After a little bit of reasoning I got her to knock off \u00a315 for the last two nights. No refund was offered for the first night. The explanation being that the first night was used as a deposit and was non-refundable. We get into our room and I step into the bathroom to freshen up so we can hit the streets and see some sights. It took over three minutes to get hot water to the sink and it wasn't until my sock was wet that I realized the sink was leaking. Awesome. I Checked out the double room that my sons were sharing and it seemed to be in good working order. The single room my nephew was in was a different story. The walls were stained with I don't know what and the paint in the corner of the ceiling was peeling off and hanging down. We left the hotel to go out for the evening which proved to be chilly, around 40*. When we got back to the hotel we discovered the heat was not working. The rooms were freezing! To make matters worse they had no additional blankets to use. To make matters even worse my nephew got sick in his toilet. This is how we found out the toilet in his room wasn't working either! I don't know if it's legal to rent a room without providing heat. When I confronted the girl I explained this was unacceptable and I should have been contacted about the ongoing problems (no heat & toilet in triple room not working). At least I could've had the opportunity to make other arrangements. Needless to say we found rooms for the next two nights at a hotel two doors down from this hell hole. Again when we stayed here in '07 it was quaint and clean but it now looks like they haven't done a thing to the place since we left almost five years ago! The place is in total disrepair.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cA nightmare from hell\u201d", "Author": "Sonicjess", "ReviewID": "UR125565113", "Content": "I've been working at Alexander Hotel, September-November 2010, and I will recommend all of you travelers to stay away from this hotel.

The first night we were assigned room no. 2, the room was far below average but worst of all we were bitten by bedbugs. In the morning a girl from Spain which acts as cook and cleaning staff took also the receptionist role and switched us to room no. 3. Room 3 greeted us with a worn down carpet and hole in the floor where you could step into broken wood and a couple of rusty nails, the bathroom was so tiny I could not shower without hitting the shower valve and inevitably changing from freezing to scalding water, also the faucet was outside of the tiny bathroom. We thought we had left the bedbugs behind but on the third night we found many lying around on one of the beds. Again staff was unavailable apart from the cook/cleaner/part-time receptionist who, of course, in spite of her best efforts could not offer us a valid solution. We had paid for a fourth night but decided to leave and paid about half the rate for a far cleaner and better room on the Easy Hotel just accross the street. In summary: paid for 4 nights, stayed 3, slept just one night. The manager a guy that goes by the name of Raphael took two weeks to answer his mobile, offered me a refund for the fourth night but I still haven't got it.

It was such a bad experience. Good points: * Close to Victoria Station which makes easy your traveling across London and England Bad points: * Soooo old rooms * Fire traces and not useful toilet in my friend's room * Fleas and bedbugs in the triple room beside the reception, as a well as a ridiculously small bathroom where you are not able to bend 'cuz you don't fit in the tight walls * No way to contact the staff after 11pm * Dirty facilities * More EXPENSIVE compared to the prices with the neighbour hotels \u00a375 in double room and \u00a3100 in the triple room. The prices in neighbour hotels are \u00a350 in double room and \u00a375 in triple room, with breakfast included. * Tatooed cook girl whom serves food and attends reception while the receptionist is not available! * Not satellital tv as offered in the website * Not Wi-Fi available as offered in the website * Slim walls, you are able to hear EVERYTHING in your neighbours rooms, disgusting! Well, I don't recommend this nasty hotel at all and advice you to search in neighbour hotels as easyhotel or Belgrave Hotel (both of them in front of the Alexander, with much better facilities and CHEAPER rate ), or Stanley Hotel (2 doors away) for similar facilities but clean and with light. Me and a friend of mine made a tour door to door through the area hotels 'cuz it is not possible to be at Alexander. It's more than you can stand! Horrible!

I normally check things out with Tripadvisor first but we were pushed for time so I took a chance and made a booking then felt very worried when I read the reviews. So what was our experience? Well, on the positive side, it is very close to Victoria Station thus making London very accessible. We did not have any problem with the booking - we were late arriving but the nice woman on reception buzzed us in and was very polite and competent. The staff are mostly young European women and they were all helpful and charming. We were a bit early for breakfast but the young lady let us into the dining room and promptly took our order. The brekafast is not going to win awards but we had cereal followed by toast and scrambled egg along with a cup of tea. All perfectly adequate. On the downside, the rooms are small and although we had quite a nice tv in our room, the tiny one in our daughter's single room did not work. That said, we were out all day so that was not really an issue for us. The showers are ok but hot water is still hit and miss. The rooms are cleanish but they certainly are not particularly modern. My daughter thought her room was a joke when we opened the door to be faced with a doorless hanging wardrobe to the side and 2 white fire doors in front of us. In fact, the tiny single room was hidden behind these very springy doors. Hmm. Not sure that would impress anyone! Overall, they seem to have improved on the meet and greet front and the rooms are ok if you just want somewhere to dump your stuff and go off round London. The staff are also very good about allowing you to leave bags at reception once you check out. Would I use it again?

Based on my research, hotels in London can be pretty expensive, so when I found a decent deal on the Alexander Hotel, I took it. We stayed there for two days, and the location was decent, but the accomodations were nothing to write home about. The room we stayed in was tiny with pretty much just enough room for the bed and a small table. The bed itself was comfortable. The bathroom was very small and the shower was a problem. The shower had warm water but sprayed in a strange pattern, and no matter what you do, the floor becomes thoroughly soaked. I believe I read this in another trip advisor review and thought that wouldn't be a big deal, but an inch of water covering the floor in cold London is really uncomfortable. If you take a shower in the evening, the water is waiting for you in the morning. God help you if you are wearing socks. We had a first floor room, but there is no elevator which may make it difficult for guests who have difficulty lifting their luggage. The breakfast was unremarkable but also unoffensive. I do have to say that the location was pretty nice. It was only a 5 minute walk from Victoria Station, and we actually rolled our luggage from the station to the hotel. We were also not far from the meeting point of our tour to Stonehenge. In its favor, the staff were very accomodating and met us back on a Saturday to give us our luggage that they had held while we explored the city.

The staff was all foreign college students who were quite friendly and the breakfast was basic but good.", "Date": "July 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "santa barbara, ca", "Title": "\u201cGood place to stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2185906", "Content": "Despite reading some mixed reviews we decided to stay last minute when a friend came back from a trip to London to say she had left another hotel on the same road (Holiday Inn) and moved to the Alexander hotel for a better price. Staff were helpful (the girl on reception found an indian restaurant on the internet for us) and the room was clean and bright, a bit tight around the edges but the shower in the bathroom had a fabulous extra large head which was just great! Price is right (65 pounds) and the place is close enough to the station to walk (which saved a cab fare). Bad points: breakfast is only to 9\u2026 we arrived just before 10 on our first day (but they gave us toast and coffee still). The weather was in a heatwave so without air conditioning we had to leave the window wide open all night but it wasn\u2019t too bad. There was no hairdryer but again the receptionist gave us one to keep in the room when we asked. Summary: excellent website (our room WAS as shown on the site) with directions and information, genuine staff, location in a good spot, a few bits here and there but nothing major and nothing you wouldn\u2019t expect in this price range anyway. At the end of our trip we left London feeling good, the Alexander is a friendly place to stay folks, if you ever go to London give it a look in!", "Date": "June 13, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cA very enjoyable stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2184911", "Content": "My husband and I stayed in the Alexander Hotel for four nights in May, and we found it to be a very pleasant experience, contrary to the previous reviewer. It is certainly what one would call a budget hotel, and travelers should expect to get what they pay for, as it is a relatively cheap option for London. The carpet may not have been exceptionally clean, but everything else was wonderful. We stayed on the first floor (second floor in the U.S.) and although our room was very small, it was comfortable and even had a balcony! It was very nice to sit out there in the evenings. Our room got street noise during the night, especially with the windows open for ventilation, but it was not a problem. I'm not sure if they have air conditioning in the hotter summer months; should check. We very much enjoyed the English breakfasts, finding the eggs not at all hard. There was a good selection of food. One of the best parts was the en suite bathroom, which is a rarity in London B&Bs in this price range. Ours was great except without a shower curtain. All in all, a very good option for someone on a budget and very acceptable. Also in an excellent location for sights and Victoria Station.

We checked around the street and many other places we saw were not up to scratch, but the alexander was on the whole excellent. Nice comfortable room with pretty furniture and the staff were polite and helpful and knowledgable too. They recommended a great restaurant nearby and I have to say it was one of the best meals we've had on any of our vacations over the years. The only problem I had was that our room was quite high up and there is no lift, but once you got there the room itself was actually very nice. Breakfast was also excellent, long live the great british fry up! Would I stay here again? Yes - the price was good and the service was warm and its in a good location close to the tube station. I don't know what the reviewer above smelt but we didnt smell anything bad the whole time we were there and our radiator also worked fine.

The staff, especially the wait staff, are very friendly and helpful. The free breakfast was good: eggs, bacon, toast, cereal, fruit, etc. The location is good, 5 minute walk from Victoria Station and other tourist sites, such as Westminster Abbey, were about a 15 minute walk. Best bar around was The Elusive Camel. The location was quiet and the bed was comfortable. Negatives: My room did not have a heater or radiator when I arrived, fortunately when I asked the front office the manager immediately grabbed a temporary radiator from his office and took it up to my room and plugged it in. The last night I stayed a radiator had been installed in my room, but it covered the cable outlet, and therefore I had no TV, and I could not get the new radiator to come on. There was a weird smell in the hallway and in my room. Opening the window during the day helped, but not quite enough. The bathroom had some mildew and the air vent was clogged with dust bunnies. Other than that, the room was clean. I would probably not stay here again, but the price is right for a few nights.", "Date": "November 6, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWon't hesitate to stay here again...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1154537", "Content": "Planning a trip to London, this is a great hotel to stay at!

Not to mention the best breakfast we've had at a hotel ( who says English food is bad? )... These praises aren't idle folks, we really had a great trip, due in large part to this hotel. The downside of the hotel is, as with most hotels in the UK, the rooms are REALLY small. If you are traveling with more than 2 people, it will be a real tight fit. We had some friends stop back by the hotel at night & could barely fit the 4 of us in the room.
