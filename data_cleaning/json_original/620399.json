In addition, the housekeeping manager was very nice and helpful when I needed his assistance. Overall, the room was small but comfortable. At night, I often heard some noises from the trains but nothing too serious. The bathroom products (Ren) were nice. The hotel basically offered every thing you needed except a toothpaste and toothbrush.

Can a proprietor sign in and give himself a glowing review? Can a competitor sign in and trash the competition? So, as a comparison, I thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d look at the reviews of the Duane Street Hotel in New York. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at this property about a dozen times over the past 18 months, while traveling for work. I was amazed to find that 19 of 88 reviewers rated this hotel as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153poor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found the Duane Street to be an excellent hotel. The rooms are small but clean and well appointed. The staff is friendly, professional and helpful. The location is perfect for my purposes, because I can walk to my meetings. Tribeca is an interesting neighborhood, and you are just a few blocks from Ground Zero and St. Paul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chapel. The beds are extremely comfortable, and in my experience the heating and cooling are easy to operate and work well. Yes, there is some street noise, but I find the rooms to be remarkably quiet given that you are 3, 4 or 5 stories above a fairly busy street in Manhattan. Street noise has woken me up a couple of times, but that can happen anywhere. I think being just a few stories above Church Street gives you a sense of scale and a feel for the city. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m still left wondering how useful this site is. If I saw a hotel that had more that 20% of its reviews rating it as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153poor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrible,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay away. If I did that in this case, I would have missed out on a great hotel. If you read through the negative reviews, common themes are small rooms, street noise and poor service, my experience on those fronts is addressed above. There are some one off situations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like the guy who had the building fire alarm go off while he was in the shower. Other complaints raise real questions about the reviewers themselves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how long was that guy planning to store two dozen boxes of cupcakes in his hotel room? Does anyone really store large quantities of cash in a hotel room? Can all of these stories be true? The attitudes, preferences and expectations of the traveler play a large role in their experience of a hotel.

Also on the positive side; the hotel has a deal with a nearby gym, so even though there is no gym at the actual hotel you can get a great workout just down the street. To those complaining about noise from subway etc I totally disagree. Sure, you can notice the subway if your mindset is all about finding negative aspects of a good experience, but if you are so sensitive to noise I would suggest a different destination all together or at least bring some earplugs ;) For us it worked out perfectly", "Date": "March 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paradise", "Title": "\u201cThe Unhappiest Place on Earth.\u201d", "Author": "wwrrkd", "ReviewID": "UR57002356", "Content": "Like spending six nights in the 7th layer of hell.

We went to NYC for a fun weekend adventure and we got a little bit more than we bargained for. Aside from my wife being convinced a camera crew would pop up to tell us we were on \"Reality Hell\" (google it), we sure had much of the adventure we were looking for. We checked in and dropped off our bags earlier in the day and when we returned around 11pm to pick up the keys, everything was fine. The girl at the front desk was the sweetest thing, Ana, was her name (same as my daughter), she engaged into a delightful conversation while she handled our questions about the city and made us keys. She assured us if there was anything we needed to better our stay, do not hesitate to contact her directly. That made my wife happy, which is all that matters. We decided to retire early and get ready for a busy saturday of sightseeing and our \"Big City Adventure\" that my wife prepared a scheduled itinerary, covering everything from time to sleep and shower to bathroom breaks and meals. Upon entering our Guest Room, my wife began unpacking her things. I, on the other hand, was scheduled to shower. After retrieving my pajamas, and headed into the beautiful shower, with minimal water pressure (not by choice), the fire alarm ruptured both of my eardrums with the echo in that bathroom. Of course, my wife calls the lady at the front desk to see \"What's Wrong?\" to find out they are not certain, but to be cautious we should come downstairs until further notice. She informed us the elevators were not working, to take the closest stairwell to the 1st floor. We found the closest stairwell and began to walk calmly down the stairs. Once we got to the lobby, there were about 3 fire trucks outside and about more fireman than you can imagine. The poor girl that gave us the keys was playing the role of SuperWoman. Making phone calls to management, calming down scared guests and handling all the requests of the firemen. She was real trooper, no joke, to the point that in the midst of all this chaos, one guest asked her from a room change. Surprisingly, her response to the guest was very calm and she informed her once things settled down, she would be more than happy to fulfill that request. If I was her, I would be singing a totally different tune. Turned out there was no fire in the hotel. We were not on any Fear Factor or Reality TV Show, which I think disappointed my wife. But we definately had the Big City Adventure, just not the one that was planned. We want to give alot of credit to the Front Desk Agent, who handled this event with the utmost professionalism and courtesy. She was the only person there and was able to multi-task without any guidance. She is truly an assest to this property. It was a scary situation for my wife and I, worrying if all of our things would be okay as we took nothing but a cell phone downstairs. I was wearing nothing but boxer shorts outside of the Duane Street Hotel. Other than that, I now see why New York City is the City that never sleeps, or was it Sin City? Either Way. The one thing that does worry me, although the Front Desk Agent handled everthing well, was if this was a real emergency.

Having stayed at many fine hotels in the City such as the Tribeca Grand, The Four Seasons, The Peninsula, The Palace, etc., I'm used to being spoiled, and used to great hotel locations. Interestingly I accidentally discovered this hotel, The Duane Street Hotel, a year ago during a two-week stay at the Tribeca Grand, wandering the neighborhood. At the time I asked the front desk if it would be possible for them to show me a sampling of their rooms and they were very gracious in doing so. I made it a point to put the Duane on my short-list for future trips. What stands out most is the high-quality professional staff. Each and every member of the staff, including the managers, front desk, housekeeping, dining, and maintenance, are friendly, experienced, caring, considerate, professional, and dedicated to providing the best possible guest experience possible. The [smaller] size of the hotel allows for personal service and attention which can easily get lost in the bigger hotels. There are no slackers here. Everyone is on their toes, consistently going out of their way to provide great service in a very timely manner. They are all to be commended for going the extra mile. Speaking of miles, this brings up yet another great benefit of the Duane. It's location. Convenience to SoHo, Tribeca, and the financial district, all by foot, the pi\u00c3\u00a8ces de r\u00c3\u00a9\u00c2\u00b7sis\u00c2\u00b7tance is direct access within about one block of a multitude of trains [subways]. I live by the trains to get me where I want, fast, so it's important that my hotel be located fairly near major train access stations and the Duane, by no accident, is a dream come true with direct access to the A & C lines as well as the 1-2-3 lines. As if this is not strategic enough, just walk over another avenue cross-town to catch the Lexington Avenue trains at the Brooklyn Bridge City Hall Station for access to the 4-5-6! With such quick and easy access to all these major arteries one can travel by train to virtually any location in the City within minutes. Again, the best part of the Duane's location [in addition to being located in the desirable Tribeca area] is it's proximity to the subways, within just a few footsteps. In closing [I'm currently mid-stay during a two-week business trip] I am happy to recommend The Duane Street Hotel to anyone looking for value, location, amenities [yes, they even have thick-heavy bath robes], attention to detail, cleanliness, and most importantly a professional, gracious, and friendly staff. I look forward to re-booking future stays at The Duane. John Hay p.s. ......it's true about the beds. It's like sleeping on a cloud. Also, the rooms are extremely sound-proffed by what appear to be recently installed \"duplicate-double-paned\" dual sets of all the windows which practically eliminate street noise.

I will never stay here again or recommend this place to anyone.", "Date": "October 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "northern California", "Title": "\u201cLocation and boutique charm, but no perfection\u201d", "Author": "slooone", "ReviewID": "UR20912258", "Content": "The Duane St hotel is admirably sited for anyone whose work or play have them in lower Manhattan. Transport to anywhere in New York -- indeed, anywhere in the world -- is as straightforward as from any other hotel. Almost all subway lines, save the 7, the G, the S shuttles and the F/B, converge within a few blocks of the hotel. You are within a few minutes' walk of the major WTC PATH station for a quick trip to EWR (about 48 min), to the A train for an even quicker trip to JFK (41 min). Taxis cruise up Church St day and night -- even in the rain. Greenwich Village and Downtown Brooklyn are each 10 minutes away by subway. All Tribeca and Financial Dist locations are an easy walk, and even South St Seaport is only 15 minutes on foot. The hotel is small enough that the desk clerks all knew each of us -- not by name, but well enough to remember if we had just left or been out all day -- on our second day there. With only 6 floors, you needn't wait for the elevator and can just bound up or down one of the staircases. (Elevator wait is a major time sink at the taller of Manhattan hotels, especially with older elevator technology.) Our room faced directly onto Church St (the busier of the two streets, whereas Duane St is relatively quiet). No problems with street noise, even during rush-hour. The A/C/E trains were a faint rumble every few minutes. The hotel has guest privileges with a well equipped health club two blocks away. In a basement and sub-basement, the club will strike many visitors as claustrophobic, but it has a huge array of free-weights, machines, and cardio equipment. The Duane St Hotel staff were uniformly informal, friendly, and helpful. They weren't always perfectly competent, but at least they were nice about it. Our room was sparse, stylish, and fully equipped. Two queen sized beds with comfortable linens and copious pillows had us resting comfortably. The room was small, but not closet-like. On that subject, there wasn't really enough closet space, and only two hangers, or enough drawer space for a couple and a child. We used room service for one breakfast, and the soft-boiled egg was perfectly done, a pot of genmaicha generous and hot, but the chocolate croissant didn't even get a second bite. Still, the prices were fine and there is plenty of food day and night within a block of the hotel. Here are the problems we had, and only the first was particularly annoying: - we booked a car from EWR through the hotel for a 1 am pickup. In two e-mails, well before arrival, I provided complete flight details. The driver didn't show. When, after an hour of back and forth, he finally arrived, it wasn't at curbside, but he led us through the parking access into the parking lot. Absurd, and $110 rather than the $71 we had been quoted. (And much more than the $50 cab.) - sheets were not immaculate. Just minor stains and a small tear; nothing too distressing. - items in the room seemed to be restocked on some kind of Soviet-era plan. One day the single water beaker disappeared; one day it was the cotton-swabs; another day we were short a bath towel. The next day we got a double delivery of shampoo and hand lotion. I ended up asking for three water glasses. - bathroom fixtures were functional but not perfect, and the hand-towel bar was mounted directly above the toilet paper holder! Try drying your socks when you're worried about dripping onto your only roll of toilet paper. - the air conditioning is unconscionably loud. Like having a jet engine in your room. Fortunately, it blasts cold air so rapidly that it's only on a few times in the course of a night. But in midsummer, you'd want to wear your Ipod to sleep. - a mysterious mini-bar \"coke\" charge appeared on our final bill. I don't think any of us have coke for decades, so I had it taken off. I would recommend the Duane St Hotel to people who want the location in Tribeca. It's considerably cheaper than the comparable, but larger and slightly swanker, Gansevoort, about 20 blocks north but in a similarly fashionable neighborhood. As boutique hotels go, it is pretty and cheerful. The staff might not always get everything right, but they genuinely seemed to try, and they all had the friendly openness that is one of my favorite things about visiting New York. Our rate averaged $409 plus taxes over 4 nights. This is expensive by my wallet, but fine for an upscale New York place and almost absurdly cheap by London standards.", "Date": "October 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cgreat location - insanely loud!!\u201d", "Author": "Furleybird", "ReviewID": "UR20644660", "Content": "Great location to so many things, subway is very close and you can walk to Chinatown, little Italy, and the financial district.

It faces Church st and the windows have zero sound proofing. I could hear people talking on the street! It got so bad that I had to buy ear plugs and eye covers which makes for an absolutely terrible sleep. We got the room for $300 a night, some people paid $500 as I heard another guy complaining at the front desk about the price and the noise.

My fiancee and I stayed for four nights and fell in love with the Duane Street Hotel. Staff was great (especially the door men), concierge was well informed and efficient (Maggie was the best). Rooms were small-ish, but reasonable by new york standards. Loved the hardwood floors and beautiful bedding. Made the room feel extraordinarily clean. The small sweet treat that was left for us each night was also delicious! We had breakfast each morning in the restaurant because our rate included breakfast. Service was great, and the food was awesome! We noticed, as others have, some noise from the street and the construction that was taking place outside, but it wasn't enough to keep us up at night.

Room was small as expected with tiny closet and nowhere for luggage but as this was the start of a longer trip we did have 16 days worth of luggage. Fresh and bright decorated room but as noted already, design of bed, whilst having a comfortable mattress has a wooden base that it is easy to walk into and get bruised from. No fridge. Also safe in closet slightly too big for closet so closet door wouldn't shut properly. Not a problem, just poor design. Another design fault (due to size of room no doubt) only one bedside light. Flat screen TV. Small bathroom, but no smaller than most hotels (could do with a hook for the bathrobe, actually could do with a second bathrobe - why not have enough for the number of guests in a room? Our Boston hotel did the same - is this a new trend?) Shower was a rain shower so not very powerful. Nice toiletries in bathroom and decent hairdryer. Very noisy outside of hotel as some sort of roadwork going on - not sure what it was but a sort of giant orange and white cone covering a hole in the ground that was always noisy. Not the hotel's fault and I always bring earplugs anyway. Location was good, very close to subway so easy to get anywhere and away from the midtown madness, so much more peaceful away from the crowds. Really liked staying downtown. Found all the staff to be very pleasant and helpful. They accepted a package for us before we arrived (Yankees tickets from Stubhub) and brought this to us as soon as we arrived.

Im glad i did as it was probably the best stay so far. I couldnt really fault the hotel at all. stopping here was extremely comfortable and i would say the friendly staff really made everyone feel very welcome. (i noticed there seemed to be British people at the time?!). they went out of their way to accommodate everything we asked for...even special requests that they couldnt do at the front desk and the manager went out of his way to make sure it was all ok. The bed, like someone said before, was so comfortable i didnt want to leave, amazing chocolates on the pillow in the evening, great bathroom with a reasonable size bedroom and because it has so few rooms it felt alot more relaxed and personable than any of the other larger ones. the whole time i never heard any noise from the other guests or from inside the hotel. but i could understand how the street noise from Church that all the rooms look out onto, may cause some people discomfort. at the time they were doing roadworks from 8pm till the morning but it still didnt disturb me. i would recommend asking for the top floor like we did. overall no problems stopping here at all, especially if youre looking for quiet friendly and extremely clean! (free internet access and ac in the rooms). the guy at reception, i think called Sebastian also needs a mention as he was always there making an effort. and u can always and i mean always get a taxi straight away from outside on church st. subway station is very close too. minor things some guests might want to know. -the hotel has no ice machines, but everyday house keeping would fill the ice bucket for us just incase. -the corners of the bed were so sharp as it has a shelved lip, that i came back with alot of bruises due to not much room to manouver round the sides of the queen bed. -the lift is very slow, but it only has 6 floors so who cares. -i didnt see anyone use the bar or small restaurant, but its New York you dont really need to. and why do you only get one robe these days?! all the rooms seemed to be pretty much the same, so no budget option but no penthouse style suites either, just functional rooms. and has everything really you need. i will keep going back here as i left feeling a sense of trust. excellent for a 3star hotel in NY. and away from the usual tourists. there probably was some teething problems still and i did hear some other people vocalizing issues. but we had absolutely none. came back feeling really positive about our stay.", "Date": "August 1, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Duane Street Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d620399-Reviews-Duane_Street_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$270 - $507*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">130 Duane Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10013</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "620399", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/a5/34/a5347c46fcfaf8d240a0c0ae591585a54large.jpg"}}
