{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Don't bother This hotel is a lesson to leaving booking a popular destination like the Cinque Terre in August too late. It was a last minute bid to get accommodation as I really wanted to see the Cinque Terre, while we were in the area, but it really wasn't worth it. The hotel is a long way out of La Spezia in the middle of nowhere, it cost a fortune in taxis which varied wildly from expensive to a complete rip off. The hotel is shabby, looking like it hasn't been touched since about 1968. The rooms were tatty, the bathroom was so tiny that it was a struggle to even squeeze into it past the sink that had to be in the bedroom as there's no room for it in the bathroom. The staff were ok, but there were no facilities at all. Thankfully we were only there 1 night, but it was too long. The Cinque Terre is overrated, heaving with people, tawdry  over commercialised, it made the Cote D'Azur look almost peaceful. Steer clear in August if you feel you have to go.", "Date": "Aug 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR757175676", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Reyn0lds"}, {"Content": "Nice little pensione Rooms were small but clean and modern. The location was close to everything. The owners/staff were very helpful and friendly but would only accept cash. The hotel was located on the 2nd and 3rd floor, but there was no elevator, so one either has to be in good health or have very little luggage. Well worth the price.", "Date": "May 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR258554788", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "JanetCanda"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d610948-r8451660-Hotel_Nella-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "610948", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
