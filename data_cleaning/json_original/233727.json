From the reviews I was feeling a bit wary. Yes the lift is very small, the rooms bit dated. On the plus side staff were polite and helpful, good choice for breakfast. The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable and you could open the windows. There was always plenty of hot water and the location was superb for getting to the sights. This hotel provides everything you need ( albeit basic in some people's eyes ) to see Paris easily and comfortably.", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sofia, Bulgaria", "Title": "\u201cVery good value for money\u201d", "Author": "Tarah_Nathan", "ReviewID": "UR123496445", "Content": "The hotel is very small indeed, and the hallways and the lift are narrow, but to my nice surprise, the room was clean, there was a big comfortable bed, the bathroom was up to standard, too (big and clean, with all amenities included).

We arrived very late, due to flightcomplications and we didn't exactly get what we expected. Instead of a room with 3 beds, we got a SMALL, very hot room with one small bed and mildew on the ceiling. The staffmember said that I had only booked a room for one person, not three persons and showed something on his computer that I didn't quite get since it was in french. When I came home I checked my onlinereservation and it clearly stated that I had ordered a room for 3 people. He acctually expected that we stayed in that horrible room for the night. Good luck fitting two adults and a child in a 120 cm bed. Finally we got an additionalroom after some quarrelling. One big minus was the lack of minibars or eve a vending machine in the hotel. We were deadthirsty when we arrived. The staffmember gave us a bottle of water for free, thanks for that.. The rooms were shabby and not at all like the pictures but clean (enough). The elevator deserves a chapter of it's own. Never saw a smaller elevator and the halls were very narrow two. I'm certain that the safety on this hotel is not up to date! Location, location, location.. What can I say, this hotel is almost perfectly located and is the only reason to why one should pick this hotel! We had a room on the top floor and could acctually see the sacre cour cathedral from the window. Staff was helpful, except from one guy, the one who wanted us to stay in the small, creepy room. I understand that the hotelstandard in Paris is poor but this is NOT a 3* hotel! We stayed in an acctual 3* hotel in Norway on our way to Paris and that hotel was a palace compared to hotel ce chateaudune..", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam", "Title": "\u201cAverage with one big plus!\u201d", "Author": "Gmuzza", "ReviewID": "UR98550538", "Content": "I stayed here for a couple of days on my own whilst on some personal business. I found the rooms adequate but nothing special. It was clean and bedding was changed daily with nice crisp bed linen. It is situated on a fairly busy road so if you are the front then you need to keep the double glazing closed for sound insulation. ONE BIG PLUS... when I left Paris I actually left my laptop in the room... I only realised on the train to Amsterdam so I called them immediately. They found my laptop and posted it back to me within a few days for no charge! The hotel may be average but I can 100% vouch for the honesty of the staff.

The road noise was constant and you know when your neighbors are settling in for the evening. My advise - spend the extra coin on a 4-star. I've never had any trouble at the Le Meridien Etoile.
