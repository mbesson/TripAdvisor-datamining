We were looking for somewhere to stay at a budget price and this place was mentioned when I submitted a question on here loo king for budget motel in LA. The lady who owns the motel showed us round when we arrived and explained parking arrangements because parking is very tight, but not a problem. but free which is a bonus in LA. Rooms were clean with fridge and microwave. The rooms are not ultra modern but at the price you pay this place is a real bargain. Complimentary breakfast in the morning bagels/fruit and cereal. Nice Mexican/sports bar up the street and Ralphs supermarket in opposite direction. Well placed for exploring LA...Recommended", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay here!\u201d", "Author": "mrsarizona", "ReviewID": "UR117381719", "Content": "Never again will I stay at this motel.

Every other review of this motel is accurate. The area is peppered with reasonably priced restaurants, dry cleaners, a supermarket, and even a \"Belgian Chocolate Shoppe\" right across the street.

I was pleased to find the Wilshire Motel because it was within a couple of blocks of the office building where he needed to be each day. Parking is at a premium in that area, but since the motel (which provided free parking) was within easy walking distance of the office building, the parking problem was solved. There are several places to eat in the area within easy walking distance. A supermarket is even nearby to pick up snacks. Prices range from $75 to $105 (single rooms, cottages with 1 or 2 bedrooms, some rooms with microwave and refrigerator, some cottages with kitchenette). To find accommodations in that area on Wilshire Boulevard at those prices is extraordinary. The room was comfortable and well kept. Free Internet (WiFi) is provided. The owners are quite gracious and accommodating.
