The area did feel quite unsafe - I wouldn't have wanted to stay there longer than 1 night - I think breakfast was included but we weren't told where to go to get it and we just wanted to leave in the morning any way.

This is the only advantage. The price is high for what the hotel offers. The floor was so dirty that my feet could get black after a few minutes walking on it. There was no hot water in the shower during the day, only at night. The street is noisy. The attendant was not very polite I noticed early, and later I saw him bitting (strongly) a little child in the reception. When my check out time came at 12h, I was on the shower (cold water) and the maid started to hit my door for minutes until I screamed for her to wait for just ten minutes.

The lobby is one one floor and the few rooms are two floors up. some have called this 2nd and 4th floors, but in Europe where what Americans refer to the first floor is called the ground floor, the lobby and rooms are on floors 1 and 3 respectively. The room was clean, and almost everything in it worked. However, rain the morning after our arrival took of the satellite system, which never came back on. There was no phone. There was no hair dryer & a request to the lobby got a reply that we could have it when some one else returned it. They had no adaptor plug available (we had a converter) There was no literature in the room whatever of the sort that would give information on possible services, emergency information, etc. The breakfast that came with the room was not at a cafe next door - the cafe was across the street, around the corner and several doors down. Breakfast consisted of one beverage and one pastry. In addition to our hotel, the others in the building seemed to have a clientel that varied from youthful backpackers to middle-aged and older. For our last couple or days in Rome, we switched to a hotel on the Via Cavour, equally close to Roma Termini at not that much more of a price, but with amenities (like a working phone) that appeal to my sense of safety. When we went to the lobby at check out & attempted to cancel the reservation we had for our return to Rome in a couple of weeks, the request was denied and we were told we had to cancel via the same website we had used to book the hotel.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cSuper close to the Termini\u201d", "Author": "MoondogNY", "ReviewID": "UR10441612", "Content": "Practically a block from the Eastern entrace to the train station so getting there with bags was very easy. The building was rather dumpy but the room was clean and modern. The room itself was tiny (very old school) but the fixtures and the room and bathroom were newly renovated. TV's in the rooms but no internet access or phones. It was 100 Euro a night for not much by way of services, so I wish it was cheaper but it's Roma so what can you do. The restaurants nearby were very, very reasonable and felt safe walking around. It's a long, long walk to the Colloseum or Trevi Fountain but the subway is just under the train station so you can get to the Vatican easily. The night and early morning staff (non-Italian) were friendly and helpful. My only peev is that the morning/day (past 9am) were not so and they claimed that they had technical difficulties with their credit card machine so I had to pay with cash. This was annoying since I e-mailed them before I arrived to ask if they took credit cards and they said they did. I would probably stay here again if I could not find a cheaper place closer to the Coloseum. We stayed during the Rome Film Festival so many of the hotels were booked already.", "Date": "October 30, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Milazzo", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d567315-Reviews-Hotel_Milazzo-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$73 - $149*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Milazzo, 3</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "567315", "ImgURL": "http://www.venere.com/img/hotel/0/9/3/8/8390/8390.jpg"}}
