The kids always love the serve yourself breakfast with waffles, eggs and hot food as well as cold cereals and rolls and my young teen in particular loves to make her own iced coffees with the premium creamers, etc. There were a few really nice things about this particular stay and a few challenges. The Good: Always a great price for dependable xtras... a good pool, evening food, morning breakfast, good coffee, kitchen in the room, quietness, beautiful grounds with private feel of entrances with the building design and arrangements. Beds were pretty comfortable and my husband and I good a good sleep. Front desk was friendly and check in and out were efficient. The walking path was a-w-e-s-o-m-e. My husband and I walked far every evening, past light industrial area, across the river, soccer fields, parks, etc. Safe and well maintained paved path. A lot of other bike rides and walkers; it was quite nice and didn't hurt that the weather was perfect. The ok: There were a lot of young adults staying when we were there for a week. They were outside the pool, in the pool, doing a lot of drinking, etc. They were not drunk or unruly but there was a lot of profanity I would have prefered my 8 year old NOT hear rather than hear. Still, not too big a deal. Oh, and the Jacuzzi wasn't closed, but it wasn't getting above luke-warm. And thelaundry was useful but the partying guys that were there didn't always come get their wash when it was done so there was a lot of waiting for someone to move their stuff. The unfortunate: When we got there the first night we pulled out the sofa sleeper for the kids. It was dirty... It looked like someone had eated a crunchy chocolate chip cookie on the sheets, and the mattress pad was older than the one my great grandma used to use on her guest bed -- didn't even fit over the matress actually. I called the front desk and they said they did not have rollaway beds, but they would send someone to change the sheets. We had to check a few times with the front desk throughout the evening until Housekeeping finally came. They did change the sheets and pad, but not much they could do with the sad mattress that really needs to be replaced... very worn, thin and lumpy. I asked if we could move to a larger room or even rent an additional room with an adequate bed but apparently they were all sold out every night that week we were staying. My daughter slept in the livingroom chair for that week. The front desk clerk called and spoke to my husband later that night and offerend a $25 credit as an apology for each night we had booked there, which was nice but it never showed up on our bill or on our credit card. I'd probably stay there again if the price was right, but would either get a two bedroom or two- 1 bedroom suites next time.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Providence, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cWonderful experience; clean, quiet & private\u201d", "Author": "mmontecalvo", "ReviewID": "UR117498375", "Content": "We recently had a spectacular experience at the Homewood Suites near the Seattle Airport at Tukwila, thanks to the Front Desk Manager, Michael Monosmith.

I was pleased to get a Habitat-for-Humanity rate, which, as stated, promised $5 a night to that worthy organization. I booked a king fireplace suite and the room was spacious and clean (not spotless). Balcony overlooked the Green River, which truly isn't much to look at, but beats staring at a parking lot or busy street. The room was like a small apartment. Bed comfortable. Bathroom spacious and loved having toilet/shower in separate room. Having a mini kitchen was nice, even though the utensils and cooking supplies kind of limited. (Did not plan on making gourmet meals, so this was fine!) High-speed internet was nice, but not speedy quick. I did stream several movies on my computer without issue. Things to be aware of: Parking very limited for rooms towards the front of hotel by lobby. I had difficulty finding nearby parking even early in the evening. Sometimes I had to park on the opposite side of hotel. I worked very early and late shifts while I was in town and as a solo woman traveler I found walking through dark parking lots a little precarious. Most of the lots are lit fairly well, but still a little creepy. Train noise from nearby tracks is atrocious. Trains often made my whole room shake. The tracks get A LOT of use. I thought it was odd that the fireplace suite had a Duraflame log and wasn't a gas fireplace. Perhaps there is a rule about gas fireplaces in hotel rooms, I don't know. I do know that I was mighty disappointed to not be able to turn on the fireplace for 20 minutes on a cold, wet day to warm me up! Those Duraflames burn for awhile and I didn't want to fool with all that. There is a soccer complex next to the hotel which gets a lot of traffic. A lot of soccer players stay at this Homewood for tournaments and there can be a lot of teenagers - frequently unsupervised, it seemed to me - running around and making noise.

They had one of those waffle makers, french toast, bagels, eggs, biscuits and gravy, yogurt, cereal, oatmeal, etc. We were pretty surprised at the variety. They also had milk, soda, juice and coffee.
