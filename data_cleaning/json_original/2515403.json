We stayed twice (going/returning) and found the LaQuinta virtually flawless. The shuttle to and from the airport, even leaving the hotel at 4 AM on our first stay and returning at 1 AM on our second, was very quick, the drivers consistently courteous and helpful. The check-in was as quick and seamless as that of any other hotel at which we have stayed. The room was large (king bed), very nicely furnished and clean. The beds were very comfortable. Even though it is right next to the (very active) airport, there was no noticeable jet noise in the room. There are several nearby restaurants, within easy walking distance, even in the ever-present Seattle rain. The complimentary breakfast, including a \"make-it-yourself\" waffle, and the normal cereal, baked goods, toast, juice, coffee, etc., was adequate. Since our first stay meant leaving before normal breakfast hours, the staff arranged for a few breakfast items for us before we left. That gesture was typical of the staff, who seemed to go out of their way for us. It takes a lot for us to give a five-star review. La Quinta (Seattle airport) deserves it.

Standard breakfast. The area to let your dog go was covenient and there was bags provided. Come on people pick up after your dogs! I have to say though one reason might be that they put the pags as far away from the doors as possible and you have to walk across the grass to get one.

(At hotels near airports, people come in late and leave early, so I find the top floor to be quietest.) I believe the woman at the 800 number said the whole hotel was nonsmoking. When we checked in, I again said I'd like top floor if it was nonsmoking, and was told we had a room on the 6th floor. I noticed a stale cigarette smell in the lobby, but thought it could be coming in from outside. When we walked through the 6th floor hallway, past doors marked \"No Smoking,\" we could all smell cigarette smoke clearly as if someone in one or more of those rooms were smoking. Our room, also marked No Smoking, had a cigarette smell. I called the front desk to say that someone on our floor was smoking, and they told me that half the 6th floor IS smoking rooms, and they had no other nonsmoking rooms with 2 beds. I went out in the hall again and found that the next room after ours was indeed for smokers, so I called back to ask for a new room, even if we needed a cot for the kids. After first telling me there were no more rooms with 2 beds, they found a room for us on the 5th floor, and the rest of our stay was fine. However, when people request nonsmoking rooms, they most likely do not want to be anywhere near a smoking room, and so I was very disappointed in this experience. Earlier in the week, we stayed at the Everett LQ which was entirely nonsmoking, and so I had thought LaQunta hotels had started to go smoke-free. One interesting point -- the desk clerk said the only other room free was \"way down the hall\" on another floor. I thought she meant it was right next to the elevators, which I find a terrible place to sleep due to the noise of people coming and going, but she meant it was the last room at the end of the hall. As such, it was very quiet and we managed to have a quiet night's sleep before catching a 7 am flight. (We could hear airplanes taking off or landing, but it sounded like thunder in the distance and didn't keep us awake.) So, if you want a smoke-free room, don't book a top floor room at this hotel. The other thing we didn't like was that they were playing the TV really loud in the lobby (and on a politically obnoxious station...). The room itself was fine, but didn't have a fridge, which I thought was part of the deal too. We were on the side of the hotel facing the airport, with a view of the parking garage, but there was little traffic noise. (Our first smoky room had a view of Mt Rainer but also faced the street.) Since we left early in the morning, we didn't get the breakfast (which starts at 6), but there were some muffins and coffee available when we caught the 5:30 shuttle.

High-speed internet was furnished via in-room cable and worked great with no passwords or connection fees required. The room was ultra clean. There was a blow dryer, shampoo, and a coffee maker in the room, as well as a desk, but no fridge or microwave--those would have been the icing on the cake. The front desk staff was friendly and solicitous--they even called when we'd been in our room a few minutes to make sure everything was satisfactory. There was plenty of parking and this hotel really is right next to the airport, though a few blocks' drive from the airport entrance. One small problem is that the wheelchair/stroller entrance is only on the airport-facing side of the lobby, so if you need to enter on wheels (or wheel your luggage in) you have to drive around to that side of the hotel, and it's not obvious that this would be necessary from the parking lot. The hotel is situated on the \"hotel strip\" just next to the airport, and there are several restaurants nearby.
