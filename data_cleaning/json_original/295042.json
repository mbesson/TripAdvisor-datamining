What we liked less - though it wasnt a huge problem - was 1) paper thin walls - we could hear everything in the room next door; 2) a limited breakfast with almost no fruit and little else that you would expect in a hotel like this and 3) a curious check-in process where we were first not given the room we had booked (superior room with view) and then - suddenly - we were given the right room.

Some taxi driver (actually all) will not go into this area in the city except from the airport. I don't know why may be because of the construction going on near by. 2. Besure you have this hotel map when you arrive and take a taxi from the airport to show the taxi driver. 3.

The breakfast buffet was with coffee, tea, Juice (instant), water, fruits, yoghurt plain and sweet, Eggs boiled and scrambled a choice of cheese and sausage and various bred, rolls and sweets. Although that was more than one could eat there was a menu offering additional fresh juice omelets and more at extra cost. The location was perfect: Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, Big Bazaar, Spice Bazaar, train station, habour and a lot more sightseeing points were in walking distance. The tramway station G\u00c3\u00bclhane was just around the corner; from there we could discover more of Istanbul. Around the other corner was a construction site of a future Metro station. During our stay there was no visible action and no noise and we could not see if there was something happening underground. Once that Metro station is finished the location of the hotel will be even better. The roof terrace was opened; the view was really magnificent in daytime and even more at night when the city was illuminated. The view is worth to improve the service as the terrace (7th floor) is served from the bar at the ground floor and from the kitchen in the basement. Altogether the Prince Hotel gives its service at an appropriate price-performance ratio. We can rec-ommend this City Hotel to everyone who wants to go out and discover Istanbul.

Located in one of the prettiest areas of Istanbul (Gulhane Park region) the Prince Hotel is ideally situated for short walks to the Hagyia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace and the Grand Bazaar and is also moments away from the Gulhane tram stop which takes visitors right into the heart of the city (to Taksim Square). Smart but unremarkable as a building from the outside, the Prince is modern and welcoming inside. Standard rooms are modest in overall size but the large area dedicated to the bathroom is a big advantage, as is the powerful and effective shower unit. The rooftop terrace is an unexpected bonus with its fabulous views over the Bosphorus down to Besiktas and the cruise liner terminal. Lunch or dinner on the terrace is a highlight to any visit to this charming hotel. Breakfasts are substantial affairs with both hot and cold buffets and some of the best caffelatte anywhere in the Med from their magic machine! The kitchen is surprisingly good for lunch or dinner with a wide choice of high-quality dishes. But the best thing about the Prince is its staff who are among the friendliest and helpful of any hotel I have visited around the world. Their genuine interest in their guests and smiling, \"can-do\" attitude make it a pleasure to stay there. Having stayed at some 5 star hotels in Istanbul before I found the Prince, I would not want to stay anywhere else from now on. Whether you are staying for holiday or business reasons, I can strongly recommend this hotel as a base to discover the enchanting city of Istanbul.

I asked how hot it is in summer and he said about 26 to 35. At breakfast they tell you that you need to sign for breakfast and then give you a freshly squeezed orange juice.

We had a lovely room, they very kindly let us check in 2 hours early. There are some negatives regarding this hotel as well. You have to pay for EVERY extra, including tea and coffee in the room (1.5 YTL), which I've never come across in any hotel ever. Also, we booked thinking that use of the fitness centre and sauna were included, but actually you have to pay 10 euro for each, which is a shame. Sometimes in the bathrooms (in a couple of rooms) smelt like drains. At breakfast you even have to pay extra for orange juice, though that is mitigated by the amazing spread already on offer. The most helpful person is Seda in guest relations. She was always on hand to go out of her way to offer great suggestions on where to go, what to do and how to get there. When my Mum, who had come with us for Christmas, was unhappy with her room, it was Seda who intervened and made sure she got a great one with a view of the Galata Tower. Seda is invaluable to the hotel, as she is the one who really seems to care about the quality of the visitor experience. Overall, a fine experience, and I'd choose this hotel again on account of the location, the breakfast, and Seda's helpfulness.

Being inTurkey for the first time I was a bit worried about where to stay and where to go since I did not book a tour but I made sure to book a hotel as close as possible to the touristic places; and that's how I've chosen Prince Hotel. We had a very good deal where I managed to book the two connecting rooms with 3 beds for the children at almost a price of one room. The hotel was clean with good service except for the cooling system which did not work properly. However, this was not a big issue since we only needed it during day time. If you are used to 5 star hotels, then you would experience a lower breakfast experience. Internet is available in the lobby. If you are to visit Istanbul, I suggest that you benefit from the Customer Relations services that the hotel offers. We met Seda Tire when we first arrived; she was very helpful in planning our daily visits at the best rates. The 10 minutes you would have with her every morning will guide you to the places that you should visit and would save you a lot of money which you may end up paying had you booked a tour or made your own plans.

On reading the reviews on Trip Advisor it was actually our second choice - our first choice having been booked out. Some of the reviews which some previous hotel guests commented on, on Trip Advisor was that the rooms were very small (which is why it was our second choice)...not big enough to put your suitcase. How far from the truth that is - the rooms are spacious! I e-mailed EasyJet a few times to ensure that the rooms were spacious because both our children are Special Needs and they need the space. EasyJet tried to ensure that we were booked into spacious rooms. On turning up at the hotel, we were greeted by the Guest Relations lady - name: Seda Tire; she handed sweets to the kids which was very welcoming. We were shown to our room which in my opinion was very spacious - it had 3 single beds PLUS we were given an adjoining room with a double bed! We are a family of 4 - we paid for one room but were given two rooms! We didn't make use of the room with double bed and we asked the hotel to sell it to another guest, but they refused and insisted we keep it to ensure we were comfortable even though we say we will not use it but may do. After the second night the hotel did need the double bedroom in the end and offered us another room which was one room but absolutely massive! See our photos of the rooms in the photos section. One end of the room had a massive double bed and the other end had two lounge chairs converted to single beds. We had so much space we didn't know what to do with it! So the other comments on this site that say the rooms are small are not true at all; I know we sent prior e-mails to EasyJet asking for spacious rooms but we peered into other rooms as they were being cleaned and all were spacious. Not only spacious but also nicely decorated, clean and comfortable. The bathroom, which was also very spacious, had a jacuzzi which was nice. The shower is the most powerful I have encountered - on full power - it could have blown you away - it was awesome! The breakfast had a good range of food - breads, cakes, hard boiled egg, sausages, hash browns, cold meats, cheeses, honey and lots of ranges of jam, watermelon. The only downside issues for the breakfast were as follows: you had to pay extra for an omelette, you had to pay extra for freshly squeezed orange juice (the prices are displayed but the price list is not prominent and if you drunk from the glass without first signing the slip you were stuck!). There were only two cereals to choose from - plain cornflakes and chocolate cornflakes. The tea they offer is the Turkish tea which wasn't to our taste and normal black tea is an extra cost but we were not charged. About the guest relations woman - Seda Tire...she was one of the main reasons our stay was comfortable. She was great with the kids - giving them sweets only if they finished their breakfast! She was friendly, charming and walked around the tables asking if guests were OK. One morning when our older child had a tantrum which made us feel very embarrassed, Seda was able to calm her down within seconds. The hotel manager Ozgur was also very charming with the kids. It is a very child-friendly hotel. There are two PCs in the lobby with free internet access. The hotel is situated away from the busy main street with many car spare part shops around which isn't such a big deal. The location is superb - the 'Gulhane' tram stop is around 5 minutes' walk away and that stop is one stop away from the main tourist area of Sultanahmet - it's slightly uphill from the Gulahne stop to Sultanahmet - not very steep at all - so a tram would benefit those with children, Special Needs / Disabled and the Elderly, otherwise you could easily walk to Sultanahmet - it's around a 10 minute walk. The Bosphorous is around 10-12 minutes' walk away with the ferries going to the Asian side. On the way from the hotel to the Bosphorous are plenty of fast food places - both Turkish and Burger King / McDonald's. There is a small supermarket around 3 minutes from the hotel called 'Dia' where you can stock up on lots of things like mineral water (greatly cheaper than the hotels!), snacks, fruit, etc. There are lots of tourist shops around - be war of the prices - it's cheaper at the Grand Bazaar (which is 2 stops away from the Gulhane tram stop)! The Spice Bazaar is around a 15 minute walk away. In a nutshell - very very ideally situated. In some of the earlier reviews there is mention of a building site next to the hotel - a link to a tram line is being built, but the workmen discovered some Roman remains so it's presently an Archeological site until the ruins are moved to the Hagia Sofia. The only negative aspects to the hotel are as follows, and these points still do not even dent the praise we have for the hotel: - We e-mailed the hotel about the room size issue - the responses were vague and further e-mails were not answered. I questioned the Deputy Manager about thi; he apologised and cited it was a busy period which is true because the hotel was very busy - In our room there was the smell of cigarette smoke coming from the air conditioning vent. The manager said she was personally investigating the matter citing it's probably one of the hotel staff secretly smoking in the basement (the hotel has a non-smoking policy) - We had to call the service engineer engineer twice - once because the air conditioning wasn't going on - our own stupidity - we needed to put the key into the slot by the door to get the electrics in the room working - on that occasion we had to call the reception 3 times for the guy to come up; the second time we called him for another reason he came promptly - the rooms facing the lobby - you hear some clinking of crockery/cutlery from the restaurant below - it's the way the inside of the hotel is designed - see photos section with pics posted by another guest All I can say is that this hotel is SUPERB!!! It rates itself as 4 star which although is a tad below 4 star by Western European standards, is still extremely nice. I would (a) definitely recommend other people to stay there, and (b) stay there again myself.", "Date": "September 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salvador Bahia", "Title": "\u201cAn excellent stay in Istambul\u201d", "Author": "odaliscabrasileira", "ReviewID": "UR40882241", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Prince Hotel in Istambul and was extremely pleased with the facilities, cleanliness and courtesy of the staff.

However, upon entering our clean and reasonably well decorated room, we noticed a bad smell...something like dried urine.

I complained to the hotel, and finally a rather surly \"technician\" came up and said that nothing was wrong...he just looked me in the eye and told me that it didn't smell bad. However, another hotel staff person was there, and he admitted sheepishly that it DID smell bad. The hotel told us there was nothing they could do that night (full hotel), and we ultimately tried to solve the problem by keeping the window open. This was not ideal, as it can be a rather noisy neighborhood.

They told us when you want to use the gym tell us 10 minutes in advance and we will make it available to you. It cost EUR 10 per person. So, we never saw the gym. Also the use of the pool billiard was EUR 6. I don't think this is a 4 star hotel. In a 4 star hotel you would have shower/bath gel and body lotion in the bathroom. Also there was no bath stopper in the bath. At the reception we finally got one. I think when you pay EUR 150 they should not ask you to pay for all these extras. We will not visit the Prince hotel again for these reasons.", "Date": "October 26, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Prince", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d295042-Reviews-Hotel_Prince-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$113 - $334*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Nobethane Caddesi Kargili Sok.
