Our room on the second floor was a little small ,as we expected, having read the reviews, but it was clean and well-presented. There was no kettle or tea/coffee though this might have been an oversight. When we asked for a kettle and cups we were provided with them. The bathroom was large, with a bath and a shower, which compensated for the smallness of the room, There was a little balcony, which was great for looking out over the street (and the school) but when we closed the balcony door the room was completely sound proofed. We had the hotel breakfast one day, and, and thought it reasonable value although, as other reviewers have commented, it was much more fun to eat in one of the many cafes within a very few minutes walk. On Sunday, fewer places are open, but still enough to have a choice of eateries. We were a bit anxious about finding some where open, but the receptionist sent us on our way, saying if we did not find anywhere we could change our minds and have breakfast in the hotel.

We arrived very early on an overnight train from Toulouse, with two young children and 6 pieces of luggage. After a friendly greeting and efficient check in we were assured that our rooms would be provided in half an hour - and I don't think we even waited that long. We were so grateful as did not expect to have access 7hours prior to normal check in time. As a family, we had booked the 'family room'. We were on the 6th floor and at the end of the hall, there was a door that locked, so that you effectively closed off the end of the floor, and the two rooms at the end that faced each other, were ours. So we locked this door and left the two front doors of our rooms opened, so that we had a small passage between the rooms. It was a great option to an 'interconnecting room' which was impossible to find in Paris, and well priced at 314 Euros The rooms were a reasonable size, comfortable, very clean, and very quiet. Yes our room faced the street and onto the school, but there was no noise at all from it, other than some playground noise at one point, but what is there to complain about that. We had the window slightly ajar at night even though it was January to let in the cool night air, and there was no street noise that affected us. The mattress was wonderfully comfortable and beds cosy. The children's bathroom was bigger than ours and the shower more comfortable as ours had a slightly sloped ceiling over it (being on the top floor and what seemed an attic room). But our room had a little balcony which was charming. Hotel Alison is in a great location surrounded by fabulous food stores, cafes, and brasseries, with easy access to the metro and Champs-Elysees. Breakfast was generous with a large baguette, the lightest, freshest, warm croissants we'd had so far in the 5 weeks in France, yoghurt, juice and coffee, served by super friendly and polite staff, in a gorgeous old stone 'cellar' (I think it was 10 Euros). I would like to make special mention of the lady at the front desk who was on the morning shift the 3 mornings we were there. All staff spoke English, but this lady was particularly friendly and helpful and the one who was on shift when we arrived. I did not get her name, but she was a great asset to this hotel.
