The rooms are modern and spacious. We got a room on the fourth floor and did not have any problems with street noise. The location of the hotel is great - we basically walked everywhere (Ancient Rome, Pantheon, Villa Borghese, Trastevere, Testaccio, etc) except for the Vatican due to rain. The staff were very helpful - even before our arrival they arranged our car transfer from the airport and made us reservations for Easter lunch. Throughout the week they also assisted with reservations and also delivered a special dessert to our room for my birthday!

The room was very nice and clean and the staff was friendly and helpful.

We only had 40 euro on us at the moment but it was not a problem, it worked out fine anyway thanks to the staff. The breakfast was very good and there were a lot of options to choose from. My boyfriend is allergic to dairy products and therefore couldn't eat the scrambled eggs, but the staff was very quick to make a dairy-free alternative so he too could enjoy the breakfeast! The hotel restaurant was nice and the food was great. The only minus that we could possibly think of is the noisy street outside wich makes it a bit hard to sleep (but that's what can be excpected if you want to live central) aswell as the somewhat hard beds.

The view was definately better in the deluxe room and the addition of the Expresso machine made a world of difference to us. Thank you to Claudia for arranging our change of room. Whilst on the subject of Claudia, we cannot praise her enough. Claudia remembered us by name each time she met us, gave us superb advice on restaurants and how to get to places on foot or by transport. My partner had a personalised cake sent to our room on his birthday again organised by Claudia. The restaurants were ALL excellent and Claudia interpereted our requirements perfectly ( we wanted Roman food, good atmosphere and interesting surroundings) and recommended different areas each night so we saw different parts of the city. All of the staff we met at other times of the day were extremly helpful as well but Claudia did stand out. The Breakfasts were excellent with a good selection of hot and cold food, the coffee was excellent and our waiter very pleasant and attentive, I think his name was Giacomo, we missed him on his day off! I would recommend getting to Breakfast before 9.30 as after that the food does seem to get a little sparse that is the only very minor fault that we found. We still had sufficient to eat but just not a great deal of choice on one of the mornings when we went out for an early walk and returned for a later breakfast.

The rooms were very clean, well maintained, contemporary design. If I had only one negative comment is that the walls between rooms were rather thin. The couple in the neighbouring room watched television until very late, past 1am, and I had to wait until they turned off their TV so I can sleep. We missed out on the rooftop restaurant experience, but we look forward to another stay there next we are in Rome. We tried the steam room on the first night, it was excellent especially if you had a long haul flight and are in need of some humid air to relax the lungs and body.

You are in the centre of Rome with history on every street corner. Rome is busy, noisy, full of character and enjoyable. If staying here you must visit the Trastevere area at night and enjoy the many restaurants and atmosphere, eat good food in charming restaurants at sensible prices. We ate in the Hotel one night (Monday) whilst the food was pleasant, the roof restaurant was closed and we were relegated to the breakfast room. With no view, few customers, no atmosphere it was a expensive mistake and we should have found somewhere else but this is our only complaint.

The next day I ordered a sandwich via room service and it was a goopy mess. However all the great things about this hotel made that not a big deal. Also I thought it was idiotic that when you leave your room and take your key, the electricity goes off in your room (that part is fine, I'm green) but it also shuts off your fridge and any gadgets you are charging!

Marco made great efforts to accommodate our requests, and was very detailed, concientious, and arranged tours and cabs for us. Alina provided us with information and helped us with taxi cabs. Other staff at the hotel were friendly, but sometimes had to be coaxed into helping us with our information requests (which according to the hotel's manual were part of the services). We had room 410 and it had a wonderful view of old roman monuments. The Hotel is ideally situated for exploration of ancient rome, with many ruins just outside your doorstep and within walking distance. The room we had was spacious, clean, well appointed, and had all of the amenities. However, we found the airconditioning to be very quirky. When we approached the staff about the airconditioning and we were made to feel like the stupid tourists who didn't understand anything and that we were telling tales about the a/c. They blamed us for the a/c problem by accusing us of having the window open all day, but we did not have the window open all day, we had just opened (to see if we could catch a breeze from outside, but there was none to be had) and closed the window upon our return to the room. Thereafter, the airconditioning still continued to have its quirks for the rest of our stay, so we just dealt with the A/C quirks on our own from then on. Most times the airconditioning shuts off after a while and even when the room is warm for a long while and the temperature rises in the room, it doesn't turn back on by itself, and it does not turn back on with any touch of the thermostat buttons; we found the trick to it was to re-open and close the window whenever the a/c stopped working and the room was still warm for a long period of time. The other quirky thing about the hotel is that it could take a full day to collect a food tray that is left in the hallways for pick up. Anyway, these are minor things, and apart from that the hotel great and all its staff are nice enough. The roof top restaurant and bar is nice and so is the ground floor courtyard. I also liked the use of the in-room nesspresso machine. Another good thing is that the staff are very visible at all hours of the night. If you are going to visit the Colosseum, we recommend getting the Roma Pass ahead of time, as it helps to surpass the Colosseum line ups. We also recommend the Underground and Roof Tour of the Colosseum, it was only 9 Euros per person in addition to the entrance fee. Apparently this is a relatively new tour that I believe is offered directly through the Colosseum. You can pre-book the underground and roof tours in English (we found the number through tripadvisor, but be sure to have the right number as some tours of the Colosseum are offered by other agencies) . When you get to the entrance of the Colosseum, ask the Colosseum staff where you can pick up your tour tag and the staff will point the way for you (the tour tag is to be picked up before you go through the the final turnstiles into the colosseum itself). We also recommend the Piazza della Rotonda on a Saturday night: its in front of the Pantheon and there was a opera singer street performer in the Piazza, and there were nice indoor/outdoor cafes, a water fountain with steps, horse and carriages, and very charming romantic. We also recommend, at night, Piazza Navona which is a spacious Piazza with street vendors, and nice outdoor/indoor cafes, water fountains, and street performers, and beautiful buildings surrounding the piazza.

This time our stay was for a week. There simply is nothing negative we can say about the hotel, the staff, the service, the rooms and the location makes this one of the best hotels we have stayed in on our many trips throughout Europe This year our daughter and her best friend joined us and we were given two rooms next to each other on the 5th floor. It was their first time in Rome and we wanted them to have a great experience. The hotel arranged for a car to both pick us up at and return us to the airport. It is worth the extra $15.00 over what a taxi would cost, to have a knowledgeable friendly driver greet us at the airport after being en route for 12 hours. We had two rooms with balconies overlooking the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin and a small park with a fountain. The view is wonderful; the rooms very clean and spacious. Rooms 506 and 507 have a full tub, wonderful to relax in after a long day of walking and sightseeing. The A/C was also pleasantly cool after long days in the sun. But more importantly, the staff is most accommodating- everything from converters, to taxis, bus tickets and directions. Marco Luzetti, the Front Office Manager, who is on duty Monday through Friday during the day was just fantastic. He is knowledgeable, friendly, and makes one feel as if you are a guest in his private home. According to my daughter, he is also quite handsome. Marco spent a considerable amount of time dealing with Alitalia for us. This is something we could not have accomplished as it required fluency in Italian. His staff, Jillian (afternoons) and Darnya (weekends) were well trained and always pleasant, cheerful and helpful. Valentino, the bellman, was always accommodating and welcoming (ask about his two children and you will see the biggest smile in Rome). All the staff is fluent in English, and very tolerant of our attempts at Italian. The morning breakfast buffet is served in a wonderful and comfortable open air patio on the first floor, and is excellent: fresh fruit, yogurt, creamy scrambled eggs, bacon, breakfast sausage, toast and fresh croissants, cereals, cold cuts, juices and coffee. There is something for everyone. The staff serves cappuccino and espresso \u2013 a nice way to start your day. For those that have indicated the hotel is out of the way, it truly is not. The only way to truly see Rome is by walking. The restaurants and night life in Trastevere are a 10 minute walk. The area called the Jewish ghetto (with some excellent restaurants \u2013 try Nonna Betta) is also a 10 minute walk. Piazza Navona is another 15 minute walk with its fountains, mimes, street artists and surrounding restaurants. We easily strolled up the Aventine hill in about 20 minutes to the see the Garden of the Oranges, and the Knights of Malta keyhole. Peek through this keyhole on a piazza designed by Piranesi in 1765, and you see a garden path that ends with bushes perfectly framing the dome of St. Peter's in the distance. The Coliseum is about a 20 minute walk or so from the hotel. St. Peters Basilica and the Vatican museum (a must see) would be better by bus ($1.45) or cab (about $12.00); but we walked back along the Tiber. It takes about 1 hour at a leisurely stroll. There is a bus stop just outside the hotel door. The rooms have motorized shutters which, when closed, drown out the noise and the light.

That is in fact where we hung out in the evenings and found drinks and dinner. Second pleasant surprise was how quiet the hotel rooms are, even in this busy location. Third pleasant surprise was a fully functioning AC system that provides pleasant comfort in Rome's blistering August weather. The rooms are well appointed, and comfortable, high ceilings and amenity-rich. Breakfast was nice and plentiful, and eaten on a lovely terrace in the hotel's courtyard. Free wifi was a nice touch.

The main reason we chose this hotel was because of the location and it didn't disappoint. We had a standard room, which was spotless, a good size, well-equiped and had a large bathroom. Our room was facing a busy road, but because the rooms are double-glazed, we couldn't hear the road noise with the windows shut. Breakfast was good - there was a good selection of continental breakfast items and also a few hot items such as eggs and sausages. My only niggle about breakfast was that you couldn't help yourself to coffee/tea and because the staff weren't eager to take our order, it was a bit of a hassle to get a hot drink. We had a few drinks at the roof terrace bar, which had great views over the forum and the river. The bar is on the expensive side, but it's probably worth it for the views. We didn't eat at the restaurant, even though the menu sounded very nice, because it seemed very overpriced in comparison to similar restaurants in the area. The location of the hotel was very good. Circus Maximus, the Forum and the Colesseum are very close by. Also, from there, it was easy to get around the rest of the city (with the exception of one day, when there was a Metro strike!). Also, the hotel is very close to the Travestere area of the city, which is just over the other side of the river. This area has lots of good bars and restaurants and also, in the summer months, each side of the river is lined with market stalls, bars and restaurants. This area is much less touristy, so more chilled out and food/drink prices were much more reasonable. Overall the staff at the hotel were friendly and very helpful, especially the reception staff, who recommended to us a lovely enoteca to visit for an aperitif. They were happy to help with any of our requests (taxis, restaurant bookings, etc). The bar/restaurant staff were good, but unfortunately, not that attentive, even when it was quiet, so it was sometimes a struggle to get served. Re: visiting Rome, if you are going to visit a few of the major sites and museums, its probably worth buying a Roma pass, which includes free entry to two attractions, discounts for others and free travel. If possible, I would suggest buying this in advance because it means that you can skip the queues for the first two places you visit. However, as there was a Metro strike when we were there, we didn't make good use of the free travel. Apparently strikes are quite common on Fridays in the summer, so it might be worth checking if one is planned. Overall, I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel. All aspects of the hotel are really good and the location is ideal for a short stay in Rome.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, friendly staff, excellent hotel!\u201d", "Author": "arctic187", "ReviewID": "UR115866369", "Content": "The hotel has an excellent location right by the roman forum/colleseum and across the river from trastevere.

Pantheon is very impressive, with the huge open oculus (i wikipedia-d that ;) ) in the roof and amazing artwork. St Peters square is also lovely, serious amount of obelisks around there.

Great views form up there & a comfortable place to have some drinks. Didnt eat there though- it looked very good from what I saw on the menu & what came out of the kitchen. Our room was on the 1st floor facing the busy street- good windows made it quiet & sleepable. Nice electric roll shades & good curtains make it nice & dark. Comfy bed, nice linens, great towels & a fantastic shower :) Strong water pressure is always the sign of a great hotel :) Nice bath toiletries- bring a bar of soap though if you dont like liquid body wash- also conditioner. Its nice stuff though. We had a suite so Im not sure the size of the other rooms. Very nice. Great breakfast in the lobby- assortment of breads, cereals, meats & cheeses. Helpful & cheerful staff, service with a smile for sure. A safe place to stay- no riff raff lurking outside, mostly tourists going from place to place. Good juices & great coffee.The 1 bummer is that the internet is 10 Euros for 24hrs- not 24 hrs of usage- you get it @ 8am- it expires @ 8am the next day & have to get a new code......

There are two lucite tables set up right in the entrance when you come in. They were staffed at all times of the day and night that we walked by and people were always eager to help. It is certainly a more modern approach to a reception, which fits with the overall modernist approach of the hotel. The hotel has a bit of a problem with the thinness of its walls. I was literally kept awake in the night (and then woken up in the morning) in the night by the sounds of people having sex (which is not the most pleasant thing in the world...). And I did not just hear one couple. All of the walls of the hotel are clearly quite thin, so I think the sounds were coming from rooms in all directions. This is not the best thing, but it is something that is easily overlooked in favor of the other possitives. The beds themselves were quite hard, but this is standard throughout Italy it seems. The best aspect of the hotel was the restaurant at the top. I didn't eat any of the food, but they have a LOVELY bar area with absolutely stunning views over the river. The wines are all very well priced, and they serve complimentary snacks while you drink. The bar was also open until midnight, and they let us stay and linger even after they closed up. The breakfast in the morning was also quite plentiful -- with a selection of cerals, yougharts, as well as fresh tomatoes and mozzerella and a selection of various meats. It was quite delicious.

The hotel is located just around the corner from the ancient sites of - Colosseum and Circus Circus Maximus. Orther sites are accessible by either a tour Bus or buses that run from literally outside the hotel door ( 81, 85, 95 etc). Which will bring to specific sites for a very small fare.

There is a roof top terrace lounge/dining area with retractable awning roof (unfortunately we were told this could not be retracted this time of year for some reason ? - even though the weather was fantastic) - which was disappointing. The 280 degree or so - vista from the terrace is spectacular looking over the city and river. On the ground floor there is a bar and a separate lounge with complementary newspapers and a couple of PC's for Guest use. Located in the centre of the building is a courtyard - which I believe in summer is used to serve breakfast - but was not set up during our stay. The breakfast itself we found average. The coffee was not good (tasted like instant coffee) which was disappointing for a 4* hotel in Italy - We would have expected excellent coffee as standard. The bread rolls also tasted strange.

We did not eat at the upstairs restaurant, but we did enjoy the excellent breakfast every morning. The food was outstanding. I want to really complement two of the concierge's; Marco and Piero. We did not have any elaborate requests, but they were always able to quickly take care of any needs we had. I did have one misunderstanding about my reservation, but it was something I interpreted incorrectly. My reservation said the room came with internet which I assumed meant complimentary internet. There is no complimentary internet available. I was not there to work, so this was not an inconvenience to me. There are internet access cards available for purchase that will provide internet access. We went across the bridge to Trastevere for most of our meals. Our favorite spot was Ristorante Carlo Menta. It is one block west of the Tourist Information kiosk in Piazza Sonnini. The piazza is on Vialle di Trastevere just south of the Ponte Garabaldi. We did purchase a Roma Pass during our stay in the city. The pass is 25 Euro each, and can be purchased at any Tourist Information kiosk. The pass is good for three days, and allows the user free transportation on the subway, busses, and trams. It also gives the user free admission to the first two museums visited, and discounted admission on other participating museums. We did not effectively utilize the pass, and probably overspent our money. To make the transportation portion of the pass pay for itself, visit www.atac.roma.it. This is the website for the Rome bus, tram, and subway services. There is an interactive portion that will allow a user to enter their departure point and destination. The website will show the user the route and busses/subways/trams to use to reach the destination entered. Overall, we were very happy with choosing the Hotel Forty Seven.

Chose the hotel because of its close proximity to all the main attractions as well as the availabiity of good restaurants within easy walking distance. Service was uniformly excellent. Nothing too much bother for the ever helpful receptionists.Particularly useful when faced with dealing with the aftermath of a wallet \"expertly\" stolen elsewhere in the tourist haunts of the city. The reception area did however become a little chaotic at times owing largely to the fact that there is no reception area! ! Merely two computer screens with reception operators. No doubt this arrangement confers advantages in terms of flexibility but I personally prefer a more formal set up whereby someone has to remain on duty behind the desk at all reasonable times. Strictly a very minor quibble as the rest of the hotel was well geared to our enjoyment. The de luxe room was immaculately serviced and featured one of the most comfortable king sized beds ever. On an environmental note towels were changed only when requested, a practice that all hotels might usefully follow. The shower- personally prefer a bath as well- was effective and easy to control. The internet on the TV proved cumbersome in the extreme and was only useful for the most basic of web functions.No matter as we did'nt have much time for on line activity and more orthodox web access was available next to the foyer. Our room was on a corner immediately abutting the Via Petroselli so some noise proved inevitable.This can be eliminated almost entirely by recourse to the electronically controlled blinds and shutters but we prefer to sleep with the windows and curtains partly open so as to avoid the uncomfortable feeling of being hermetically sealed in a blackout!! No white wine in the mini bar a small minus. The Nespresso coffee machines were a plus provided that you like your caffeine fix very strong indeed. The Circus rooftop restaurant while not cheap was nonetheless good value. It offered a combination of local roman specialities-some better than others- with a more international cuisine. Wine prices were little higher than the average in Rome where even some of the more modest establishments seem to inflate margins by more than is customary elsewhere. Service was attentive without being intrusive and the setting also made it an excellent place to unwind after a sticky day in the city.

Taxis know where the hotel is just by giving the driver the address. There are no food places nearby with the closest mabye 5 minutes away. Hotel has a fine restaurant on the roof that serves good but expensive food. I had ravioli and a bottle of wine there midafternoon and it is was great. We also had dinner there after a tiring day and that experience was strange. The non-smiling hostess said we needed a reservation even though only 1/3 of the tables were occupied. After a discussion, she said she MAY be able to seat us in 30 minutes so we sat at the bar. After 30 minutes we were shown to a table. However, for the rest of the evening no one arrived after we arrived so most of the tables remained empty. Regardless, the dinner was great. Try the pumpkin risotto with choclate shavings.

They were able to call a taxi for us for our Vaticano and Borghese visits with courteous and prompt service. I really want to compliment the front desk services. I had looked literally all over Rome for a hair flat iron. I had even asked a shopping information booth on the Via Del Corso who sent me on a wild goose chase to a store that had been closed for a while. The front desk answered the question immediately with the store and location. Very impressed. They also always greeted us when we returned from our sightseeing. We used the rooftop bar twice to enjoy a pre-dinner glass of wine. They served some lovely snacks with the drinks and the service was pleasant. The hotel is within walking distance to the Teatro de Marcello where we enjoyed a piano concert one evening. It is also within easy walking distance to the Capitoline Museums and Ancient Rome areas as well as the Pantheon and Trastevere districts (although we were very unimpressed with Trastevere) We did have one sleepless night that was our own fault. We had opened the window at one point and failed to close it tightly. This shuts off the air conditioner and also allows the traffic noise in. This problem was immediately solved by shutting the window tightly after speaking with the front desk about our problem.

Take a walk along the river for a more trendy experience. Try not to grab water outside the major attractions it is a rip off. Just a little further out and it is 1 euro or less. If you don't want to pay a premium for pizza and a panini, grab it to go. Most places are tourist traps and the service isn't all that great. Don't miss the Vatican, it is absolutely breathtaking.

The best service you get is the service you don't have to ask for and the staff of the FortySeven provides it without you having to ask for it. The setting by night is fantastic and it is relatively easy to travel to the other major tourist sights in Rome. I cannot say enough good things about how pleasant a stay we had. This hotel is a bit pricey but well worth it for a truly amazing stay in Rome.", "Date": "January 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel great city\u201d", "Author": "MorrisGangOnTour", "ReviewID": "UR53385534", "Content": "What can I say about this fantastic city.

The location was good, walking distance to Roman Forum, Coliseum, Capitoline museums and Travestere. It was not near a metro, but Rome has a very good bus system and we used our Roma pass for public transport. The only issue we had was that staff was not very friendly throughout our stay. It started when my partner arrived a bit later than I did. Although he was not asked for any documentation by a receptionist on his arrival, in the evening when we were on our way out, the receptionist quite rudely stopped him and accused him of not presenting his passport to her. It could have been done in a much nicer and friendlier manner. On our second morning we ordered room service for breakfast by leaving a filled in card outside our room. When 15 minutes after the time we should have had our breakfast brought in, it was not there, we phoned the reception to find out what was the problem. They said that they didn't have our request, but would investigate and call later. 45 minutes later we called ourselves asking where our breakfast was. By that time we didn't want any breakfast in our room, as we were ready to go out. After another conversation and 30 mins later they reluctantly agreed to serve us breakfast in the bar. Again, this was done a huge favour to us, and no apology followed.

Rooms are spacious, modern, immaculate and the bathrooms are large and well equipped--tons of hot water. Excellent bed and I found the concierge to be extraordinarily helpful. Now the issues: there are going to be noise problems, both from the street and the surrounding rooms both next door and above-perhaps because the floors dont have rugs. Definitely ask for an interior room or one on a higher floor--but that wont entirely do it. My major issue is the location: it's a good twenty minute walk to the forum--in the Rome sun, that's alot; other major sites are much further. Most importantly, the hotel is not in any neighborhood whatsoever. At night, once you've returned to the hotel, the area is 100%dead (but entirely safe). There is no grocery, no bars, no restaurants, no pharmacy, no cafe's, nothing at all of that nature within miles; 47 stands alone on a fairly well trafficked downtown street. You will have to take a taxi to and from the sites and to and from dinner-which is obviously costly. Trastervere, which is like the left bank, is hopping but it's a good 15 minute walk simply to get to the beginning of the Trastervere neighborhood and it's a bit creepy walking back to the hotel late at nite from there (drunks/weirdo's particularly in the ill-lit bridge areas and the streets leading to them).

Location: My feelings about the location are mixed. It is not near the Metro, but it is easily accessible by various bus lines. The 170 bus picks you up at the train station and takes you directly to the hotel. Other buses facilitate seeing most of the major tourist sights. It is on a wide, busy road and does not have a neighborhood feel. However, it is directly next to the Capitoline Hill, Forum, Palatine Hill, and Coliseum - so it is great for seeing those sights. It is also directly across the river from Trastavere which is good for food and nightlife. I do think I would have preferred to have stayed closer to the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain areas. The hotel is very smartly decorated. The service was just fine. For some reason, maybe because we were staying so many nights, we got a special deal that included free internet, breakfast, and a 100 Euro gift certificate that could be used at the restaurant/bar. Breakfast was excellent. The roof top restaurant is a lovely place to lounge around. We thought the food was just fine - but we weren't too concerned about price because we were using the gift certificate. It is certainly a nice amenity if you are really tired at the end of the day and don't want to go back out into the thick of things. The walls were very thin, and you could hear noises from the rooms beside and above you. My mother-in-law had to wear earplugs to sleep because her neighbors would watch TV late at night. My in-laws also had problems with the air conditioning. It shuts off when you open the windows. They never opened the windows, but the maids would do so each day when they were cleaning. We finally figured out that you had to SLAM the windows closed hard in order to get the air conditioning to come back on.

Not terrible by any stretch, but nothing to write home about.

I was craving a gym during my 3 week stint in Italy. The rooms are pretty pricey, however; so you are paying for the space and the nice decor. Also, the location is a little odd: it's a couple of minute walk to get out of the ruins, where there is no real street life. That means it's quiet at night (easier sleeping), but a bit boring in the very immediate vicinity (unless you are all about the ruins). The only real bummer was the restaurant. We tried it because others had given it a good review. It was HORRIBLE. Silverware was dirty. Floor was worn. Food was down-right terrible.

We opted for a hotel pickup from FCO , which was welcome after an arduous trip from Sydney via London. On arrival, staff were extremely friendly and courteous and we were installed in our fourth floor room in no time. The rooms are impeccably clean, spacious, quiet and well appointed with all the necessities. Moreover, the bathrooms are large by continental european standards which is a bonus. After a long day sightseeing, the very comfortable bed ensured a good nights sleep. The hotel itself is very elegant and tastefully decorated with a pleasant outdoor courtyard and an fantastic rooftop terrace with great views over the Tiber and the surrounding buildings. The buffet breakfast is also perfect preparation for the I highly recommend an evening cocktail on the rooftop. There are buses that leave from just down the road although the Centro Storico (Spanish Steps, Piazza Navona etc) is a pleasant 20 minute walk. It is very well located for the Forum, Circus Maximus and Coliseum which are 10 minutes walk away. The hotel staff are ever ready to order a taxi if you require it for places such as the Vatican (about 15 euros) and the taxis arrive almost immediately.The other great advantage of the FortySeven is its close proxmity to Trastevere (and all its excellent little restaurants) which is a short walk over the Tiber.

I know very few European hotels provide this but if they want good reviews then why not? It would have been a thoughtful touch. One evening we were too worn out to go looking for a restaurant so ordered room service, which was fine, but again, very pricey & limited choice. The same can be said of the roof restaurant which hardly anyone seemed to be using whilst we were there. We did enjoy a couple of nightcaps there, but were almost alone. There is usually a van nearby for buying drinks etc. in the daytime, but otherwise there is nowhere near to stock up on snacks etc. Trastevere was about a 10-15min walk & there are plenty of restaurants there.

I booked a double delux room which on arrival didn't have a bath, just a shower, but I had requested a room on a lower floor as I'm not too keen on lifts/heights so maybe the choice was limited. The room was nice and clean and spacious. We ate at the rofotop restaurant on the first night, and as it was November and chilly, the restaurant was cold as there is no actual permanent inside seating area, there were plastic transparent shutters pulled down, which meant the view wasn't very good. I ordered fish as a main course which was rubbery, they quickly replaced it though. The food was quite expensive. The hotel is really close to ancient rome, so we were a short walk from Circus Maximus and the Colosseum. The colosseum tour was brilliant, we bought it from one of the vendors that haggle outside the venue, and it included entrance. Be aware that the tour is unlikely to start in \"just 5 minutes\" as promised, they begin the tour when they have their quota of customers (we waited 35 minutes). A short walk from the hotel is also the Vial di Trastavere, where there are lots of restaurants and cafes. We had amazing pizza, the wine was good. Service is generally laid back... We took a taxi across Rome from the hotel to the vatican which didn't take long and cost 9 euros. We ate in the room on the 2nd night as we were tired. Room service was your standard fare. We ordered a bottle of wine which took almost an hour which was a bit ridiculous considering we were on the first floor directly above the bar area. On our third and final night the concierge recommended a lovely chinese restaurant we were really impressed as there aren't many chinese restaurants in Rome so had low expectations, but it was really good fresh food.

The elevator drove me nuts, sounded like banging on the walls when moving and the walls are pretty thin. Actually I was very happy the first few days there, but on my departure, something surprising happened. My husband and I decided to go for a final walk, so we left the hotel and I decided I needed a thicker coat. He waited for me outside while I went back to my room. I got to my room and could not open my door, it had been disabled. After about the 4th try, and standing there baffled, because the staff knew the time we were checking out, did not understand why my door would not open. Will, to my surprise, there was someone in my room, it was the bellman. I had the \"do not disturb sign\" on my door, and never was notified by the front desk that someone needed to enter my room. They had every opportunity to let us know, but did not. The bellman and front desk knew we had walked out the door, they know everything that goes on, it is a small hotel. The bellman that opened my door, did not expect for us to return so soon. That is why he went as quickly to our room as he could. I do not know what or why he was in our room, but one can only feel like they were about to be victimized and do to this I was very upset. Since when do hotels, allow their staff to have access to a room without the guest being aware, and especially with a \"do not disturb\" sign on the door. The hotel has responded to me by stating that the bellman is also a technician, and he was there to fix the A/C. But, if this was such an emergency, then how come I was not notified. In my opinion, the fact that an employee can enter an occupied room without permission, and with a sign on the door, is one thing. But for the hotel to do it the minute we walked out the door ignoring the sign, and not disclosing to us a reason, is horrifiying to me. We could have been a victim and would not have discovered it until we either got to the airport, or home, more than likely the later. Then who would be to blame, by then it is too late. Nothing was missing, but the employee did not have enough time. In confronting the front desk, they did not have a clue he was in my room. I will let you be the judge for yourself as to whether or not you should stay here.

We decided to use the hotels airport transfer service (cost \u20ac50) as this seemed to be only about \u20ac5 more than the suggested taxi fare. This worked well, a comfortable car and no worries about finding the hotel, although like most Italian drivers, I think the driver was a would be Ferrari racing driver. The check in was highly efficient and friendly and as we expected throughout the stay virtually everyone we spoke to were pretty fluent in English (note to self must find time to learn Italian!) They were also very helpful with directions to the attractions and the bus stop is just 20 yards from the front door. Number 81 to Vatican City and 95 to Villa Borghese, and at \u20ac1 each for the journey not overly expensive, although leaving most mornings just after 9 meant that seats were not always available. We walked back each day and the City is small enough that meandering means it is not too exhausting. The room was a corner room, plenty of space and the only point that we might have expected/appreciated would be coffee etc. in the room. The bed was firm as we like it and plenty wide enough. We only ate in the restaurant on my birthday, the meal was good, maybe a little pricey and as we tended to eat at lunchtime a full meal was too much to eat. Breakfast was the usual self serve continental buffet, with bacon, sausage and scrambled egg for the \"English\" part. All very nice. We did spend a few evenings chatting in the hotel bar and had an afternoon drink there a couple of times, and the nibbles provided, savoury in the evening and pastry in the afternoon were very yummy. We did most of the must see attractions. We had pre-booked a tour guide for the Vatican museums. On the first Monday in February we found that we did not really need to do this as the queue to buy tickets was short and we had to wait half an hour or so while we waited for her to arrive and us and our fellow tourists to be kitted out with audio equipment so we could hear what she was saying. Don't get me wrong, the information the guide provided was interesting and informative, but on reflection we would have started earlier and seen as much, I guess, if we had wandered on our own. Possibly might have missed a few useful nuggets of information that she provided though. As it was an all day ticket we did then go around on our own to see the bits we were especially interested in, a small but good modern art collection, after we had a snack at the Museum. We were not impressed with the snack and may have been better to have continued looking around on our own and eating later. The most disappointing aspect to the tour was the Sistine Chapel. It says it should be a room of peace and no photos were allowed. These stipulations were mostly ignored and it felt like being in the middle of a cattle market! After visiting the Last Supper in Milan last yar where a number of visitors are allowed in on a strictly time controlled basis, we felt let down and that they could do so much better. What it would be like in the height of the tourist season, we dread to think. The Colisseum was stunning but needs to be visited early in the day so that the combined ticket for the Forum is not wasted. We arrived in the afternoon and did not have time to do the Forum that day as it was getting too late. The Pantheon was really impressive and although had a lot of visitors seemed to be much more peaceful than the Sistine Chapel. St Peter's Basilica was also so impressive, beautiful and very peaceful. The trek up the steps to the Cupola is an achievement but exhausting. There is a lift for some of the way, although I foolishly thought the exercise would be good for me! At the top, though, the view made it worthwhile! We ate at a number of the \"tourist\" restaurants and got good but tourist price food. The last lunchtime we went over to Trastevere and found Il Ponentino in Piazza del Drago. Looked from the outside another tourist type place but inside we found it was occupied by more Italians than tourists, a small very good value food restaurant which was well prepared and the service was just so friendly.

The previous hotels we'd stayed at during our trip were very different from the Forty Seven (old, charming buildings with an understated elegance), so I wasn't really expecting too much from this uber-modern hotel. However, I don't mind admitting that I was wrong! Yes, the hotel is very modern, but at the same time it exudes a certain charm and was really very comfortable indeed. From previous experience of hotels of this calibre, I was also slightly concerned that the staff might be rather stuffy. Happily, however, I was again proven wrong. We were both made to feel very welcome, and the staff really went out of their way to make our stay special - this extended to their leaving a bottle of champagne in our room. The location of the hotel is brilliant. Pretty much all of Rome's major sites are in walking distance (the Colosseum is about 10-15 mins away - depending on how fast you walk - and we strolled over to the Vatican in around 40 mins) and there are a great variety of restaurants and shops only a short walk away.

We stayed in a standard double room, which was of a decent size. Hard wood floors in the rooms, although they look nice, you could hear the person above, walking around the room at all hours wearing high heeled shoes, this coupled with the fact they can\u2019t have been happy with the Feng Shui of the room, as they were constantly dragging the furniture around, making the noise they created start to grate very quickly. They have put rugs in the hallways presumably to dampen the noise. Also the walls between rooms must be thin as we could frequently hear the couple next door talking and laughing. The Bathroom was Compact but usable, although the shower/bath was a little on the small side with the taps offset to the side, I was constantly bumping into them, and I\u2019m not the biggest of people. The hotel was clean, and kept to a high standard from what I could see, but that\u2019s one of the things I like about minimalist design, there\u2019s not many areas for dirt to hide. I can\u2019t comment on the hotel restaurant, bar, room service or gym as we didn\u2019t use any of them. I can recommend this hotel for the breakfast, as they supplied enough to suit most tastes, ranging from hot bacon, sausage and scrambled eggs to cereals, fruit salad, pastries and cold meats. Some reviews I read before I booked, in which people complained about the lack of space around the breakfast area, I though it was no smaller than anywhere else I had been, so don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. There\u2019s also a nice little ground level court yard to sit out in to eat your breakfast, or for evening drinks from the bar (see pic). Front desk staff were great, very friendly and eager to help from the moment we checked in, phoning the attractions up directly on a few occasions, to get us the opening times, nothing seemed to be too much trouble. There is the usual cable/satellite and internet through T.V. offering free and pay per view channels. There are Ethernet cables in every room and two pc\u2019s in the lounge area available at cost. (Come on guy\u2019s this is 2008 where is the complimentary Wi-Fi in the lobby). Don\u2019t expect to charge any gadgets while you\u2019re out and about, the rooms have a keyless entry system, you plug the card into a slot inside the room to activate the lights and plug sockets, so you have to be in the room with the lights on to charge anything, unless you use the socket in the bathroom (but ours didn\u2019t work). I can\u2019t comment on any outside noise from the road, as our room over looked a side street, but I could imagine there may be a problem for light sleepers in rooms overlooking the road, as it\u2019s a cobble stone street and some of the drivers tear past the hotel as if their butts were on fire. This was the second time we had visited Rome, last year we stayed at the Splendide Royale next to Villa Borghese. But this time wanted to try another area of the city centre, and I\u2019m glad we did as we\u2019ve seen much more of the city from this location. On the one hand, it\u2019s perfect for sight seeing on foot, I find this the best mode of transport as you get to see tons more places of interest, rather than a fleeting glimpse from a taxi, or the inside of a tunnel from the subway. The hotel itself is situated right behind Palatine Hill. Head to the left of the hotel for 60 seconds and you will find the church Santa Maria in Cosmadin which houses the Mouth of Truth, and just behind this church is Circo Massimo (Circus Maximus), walk to the end of Circo Massimo and turn left, and a few hundred yards down the road you have the entry to Palatine Hill, the Forum and also the Colosseum. Even the Vatican and Castel Sant Angelo, are only a 35 minute brisk walk away in the other direction, and even that is taking a route the long way through town, not down the river bank. There is a bus stop just outside the Santa Maria in Cosmadin Church for all the main sight seeing tour buses. On the other hand, the area is not exactly teeming with restaurants, like the Splendide Royale (Via Vittorio Veneto). Nearing the end of our stay we needed to exchange currency during a three day national holiday, I assumed the hotel offered this service, unfortunately it doesn\u2019t, which was a pain as the only places that were open, wanted to rob your eye balls out. On the whole, I would say this hotel is worthy of it\u2019s 4 star rating, and I would have no problem in recommending it as a good base to see the attractions.", "Date": "August 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cLoved up and Loving it in Rome\u201d", "Author": "YorkshireAliBongo", "ReviewID": "UR18357648", "Content": "We booked the hotel for our Honeymoon after looking through several websites to check the location and star ratings, and I must say we were not disappointed!

Buffet breakfast was nice, sets you up for a good day exploring. All the major sites are walkable, although you can really clock up the mileage, so stilleto's perhaps not the best footwear!! Roman Forum : 10 mins walk Colusseum : 15mins walk Circus Maximus : 5 mins walk Trevi Fountain : 20mins walk Pantheon : 20mins walk Spanish Steps : 25mins walk Vatican : 40 mins walk Would definitely recommend the Vatican, and if you can handle the climb, the 540 or so steps to the top of St Peters basilica gives an awesome panoramic view of the whole city. Unmissable. Be aware - they don't like uncovered shoulders/neck on ladies, or 'short' shorts - you need to cover up to get in, but is SO worth it. There is an incredible amount of stuff to see in Rome, and you just bathe in the atmosphere, especially places like the Collosseum, incredible to just be standing there! We were warned about pickpockets around the streets and attractions, so be on your guard! We never saw anything, although there were some unscrupulous locals fishing coins from the Trevi fountain with telescopic rods!! Dodgy blighters!!! Eating out, especially in the more 'touristy' areas can be a tad expensive, but I guess it's to be expected. The rooftop bar and restaurant at the hotel is lovely - great for a romantic meal for two, although check the limit on your credit card first, it is quite pricey.

On arriving our room was ready - a quieter room on the 3rd floor at the side of the hotel. Traffic can be heard but I suspect it is not as bad s a front street facing room and despite not having a view you spend more time out and about looking at the views not fromt the bedroom window. Room was spacious modern and well decorated . Great sized bathroom and shower/bath tub. Bed was very comfortable and the electric shutters helped keep the room cool and blackout for sleeping. Breakfast buffet was fantastic great seletion of fruit cereals pastries breads cheese and eggs bacon sausage.juices etc. Great way to set you up for the day. The hotel staff were all very friendly and although we did not use them for information purposes they were all very pleasant carrying bags to rooms calling a taxi and extending our chekout time as we had a later departure. Several of the staff even came to say goodbye as we left which was a nice personal touch. Would most definitely return to this hotel if visiting Rome again and have no qualms about reccommending to friends and family. I would urge people to ignore and negative reviews (there are very few) I am sure it is hard to please everyone but this hotel and I stay in many across the world for work cannot be faulted Finally the GLT Breen bus tour leaves from outside the door and once you get to know your way around this fantastic city you will be able to easily walk everywhere Collosseum, Trevi Fountains Spanish Steps We only used a taxi to and from the Train station for the airport.

We picked the hotel based on feedback on Tripadvisor and were quite happy with the choice. Front staff was friendly and helpful. Check-in was very efficient. We were placed in a room at the end of the second floor overlooking the front of the hotel. The room was quite spacious and had a huge bathroom. Furnishings were very stylish and modern. The room was extremely clean and comfortable; the bed was quite nice with high-quality linens. We did have some occasional noise issues with upstairs neighbors walking heavily on the hardwood floors in shoes and moving chairs, as well as housekeeping in the mornings. We had no problems with street noise and the room comes equipped with automated window closures. The room had Internet service for 10 euros a day. Most TV channels were in Italian, but we did find a few English channels to watch. You can also order movies, although we didn't do so. The room came with a safe, mini-bar, and bath amenities, including a towel heating rack. Self-service breakfast was included in our hotel rate. There was a good selection: hot foods, cereals, tomatoes and mozzarella, fruit, yogurt, and several juices. Service was friendly and efficient. We ate dinner at the hotel one night and were pleased with our meals. Food quality was very high, although there weren't a lot of menu choices. We liked certain dishes so much that we came back the following night for a \"snack\". We had to eat in the downstairs dining room for the first meal due to rain but were able to enjoy the rooftop the second time. The hotel is nicely situated near the Capitoline and Circus Maximus, close to the river and the Trastavere section of town. For transportation, we either walked or bought multi-day passes on the hop-on, hop-off tour buses. The buses run fairly frequently and hit all the major tourist stops, so they're an easy and predictable way to get around. Avoid the taxis, as the road traffic is insane and we got scammed by two drivers who didn't reset their meters. The Colosseum and ancient Rome area are very close; the major shopping areas are a good 30-45 min walk away, but easily doable. If you plan to visit the Borghese Gallery, note you have to purchase tickets ahead of time; we didn't realize this, so couldn't get in there during our stay. The concierge helped us with some restaurant suggestions. We tried the one closest to the hotel the last night and unfortunately had the worst meal of our three week trip there. Nice staff and lovely restaurant, but what we were served was not what we expected to have. If you can venture farther afield, I would recommend doing so, as there are tons of great restaurants all around.

There is only one thing I didn't like about the hotel. We arrived on a Sunday, so I went to the concierge to ask about restaurant recommendations. Well the lady told me that not many restaurants were open because it was Sunday and that we should eat at their rooftop restaurant. My husband and I looked at their prices and said no thank you...it's way overpriced for what you get and the drink prices are ridiulous. So, we went over to the Trastevere area (about a 5 min walk) across the bridge and the nightlife was hopping.

This was helpful because the only drawback of this hotel was the traffic along the road our hotel stood on. On a night the road isnt particularly busy but there is some traffic. During the day it was very busy and the fact it was cobbled made the noise slightly worse.

We loved the hotel. If there were FortySeven hotels in other cities that is where I would stay when visiting. It's a wonderful boutique hotel with all the amenities I've experienced at Westins and W's and even Ritz's but on a small, boutique scale. There is a small bar, a small lounge a small outdoor garden/patio and a small breakfast/dining room where the level of service and the quality of food is excellent. Additionally it all feels very European which I find refreshing in a much too homogenized world of chain hotels. Our room (Deluxe room on the 4th floor) was very nicely furnished in a modern, simple style- very clean and very comfortable. The bed was excellent and the extra bed which they brought in for my daughter was as firm and comfortable as our king bed. It was not a cot, it was not a pull out couch, it was not lumpy or saggy- it was a real bed with a thick mattress. The bathroom was spotless with marble or granite counters and with nice extra touches like a towel drier/warmer and a scale. Well, considering we were in Italy where food was almost constantly on our minds maybe the scale...... Though I've read some mention of the hotel being noisy we did not find that to be true. We were never disturbed by noise in the hallway or from other rooms and with the windows closed the nighttime noise was no greater and much less than other big city places I've stayed. No question that taking an afternoon nap with the windows open creates a noise challenge but this is a hotel in a big, vibrant, noisy city. If you are looking for a truly peaceful, noise free environment, Rome would not be at the top of my suggestion list. Maybe best of all was the staff. They were all nice, all of them. Granted some of them were less experienced than others but they were all nice and part of the charm of a small place is you get to know who to ask for what. And they seem so happy when they do help you. The concierge is very good. She helped us get tickets to a Serie A soccer game at Olympic Stadium and when we asked her for a simple restaurant where Romans might go she recommended exactly what we were hoping for. (A place where only 1 other party was made up of foreigners -in a city teeming with tourists- and where the staff seemed delighted we came. The cook who looked like Momma, came out to chat though we speak no Italian and she very little English.) We were in Rome with my brother and sister in law. Sadly, my sister in law is in a wheelchair. The bellmen always smiled and always, always were there to help carry her down the front steps to the street and always, always noticed us when we returned and rushed to open the wheelchair accessible side door.

It is much cheaper and more convenient thatn any other mode of transport if you are more than 1 person. The cost is a standard EU35.- one way. It is called : Rome Shuttle Limousine , and their website is romeshuttlelimousine.com. The lobby of the hotel is not great, and on entering was a bit of a disappointment, but everything else about the hotel was great. The breakfast was excellent, the rate, very reasonable (booked through the hotel site). The location is wonderful.. near to everything. Trevi fountain was about 10-15 minutes on foot, and the Collesue a stone's throw away (just behind the hotel). The other side of the river is walking distance (Jewish quarter, etc). Furthermore, the bus stop was just outside the hotel. Ask the front desk staff for tickets and directions. Tickets are very reasonable, and the bus takes you everywhere, Vatican, Spanish Steps, etc, if you don't feel like walking. You can even reach the Catacombes by bus. Rome is like an outside museum, but don't miss the Villa Borghese (you need to book- the hotel can do this for you). The hotel can help you plan trips out of Rome. We went for a day trip to Napoli and Pompei. I checked the price of the trip by train, but it would have been the same and a lot more trouble. The coach took us there and back, provided a guide and a very decent lunch. Ask at the reception. There is a sightseeing bus ride that can be taken from the stop which is about 2 minutes away from the hotel. There are a million things to do in Rome, but the most enjoyable thing is simply to walk around the old streets and Pisazzas.

Throw in cobbled streets and the sound of rubber on stone can be loud indeed. Great double glazing and window shutters, however, deal very capably with this come night-time and we always had a great night's kip.

It was a last minute booking and a bit expensive, but I don't regret our choice. I spend approx. 50 - 60 nights a year at big city hotels in Canada and I would pick Fortyseven over any five star hotel in Toronto, Vancouver or Montreal. The hotel is ultra modern and hip but provides old fashioned top notch service. Our room was spatious (even by North American standards) and luxurious. The personal tour of the hotel with the concierge at check-in was a nice touch. You could not ask for a better location. You are steps away from ancient Rome and the Tiber river plus the open tour bus stops right outside the front door. Because of the price most of the guests seemed to be either middle aged couples or honey mooners. The only problem we experienced was getting a taxi. Even when the front desk called for one they only showed up half the time. Your best bet is to flag one down. Be careful - the Romans still drive like the chariot race in Ben Hur. Overall, this was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at, and I would recommend it to anyone willing to spend about 100-150 euros more per night than your average 3 star tourist hotel in Rome. Dining tips: Take a 10 minute walk across the Tiber and visit Spirito DiVino for dinner. True italian dining on an old narrow side street in Trastevere. The food is first class, not expensive (try the old roman recipe pork shoulder), they speak excellent english and the owner will give you an interesting history lesson about the building which used to be a jewish synagogue over a 1000 years ago.

The bathroom is spacious with a really great shower and marble floor throughout. The outdoor window shutters, controlled from a bedside switch, added that little extra touch. Overall the room was our little haven after a long day (and night) in the Eternal city. Just perfect! The hotel is located on a street 200 meters from the Foro Romano which is at the rear of the hotel and is really quite spectacular. There is no entrance fee, and you can easily spend a morning wandering through the ruins of the Forum. The Colosseum (entrance fee) can be found at the far end, a few hundred metres away. The breakfast buffet was perfect for us, although I know some would regard it as a little short on choice \u2013 it\u2019s not the sort of buffet where you can pile up the plate with loads of hot food. The staff we encountered during our stay were friendly and very professional. We had lunch in the hotel on arrival \u2013 bit expensive; for dining, we recommend the restaurants in Trastevere, just across the river. We spent our nights at different restaurants, and found the quality and choice really good. A good meal for two with wine, coffee etc. is \u20ac50 - \u20ac60. Il Ponentino and Vincenzo alla Lungaretta are two I recall. There is a nice walk along the river bank at night where a number of bars and market stalls are setup at evening time. We visited the hotel rooftop bar for a cocktail before retiring each night \u2013 the end to a perfect day.

The Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon are less than a 15 minutes stroll from here \u2013 Trevi on the right just off the Via del Corso \u2013 turn left for the Pantheon. The Spanish Steps are 10 minutes further along Corso. We walked to the Vatican City \u2013 takes about 30 minutes. The redline sight-seeing tour bus (No.110) stops just down from the hotel (as do many local buses) and is worth the trip \u2013 purchase tickets on the bus. It covers the main sites of Rome and the Vatican City.

The view from the roof top bar was great and an excellent place to either start or finish off a romantic evening. Only a short stroll to the good sights so no need for taxis etc. My only small gripe was in relation to the mini bar. We had some crips, peanuts and some drinks on our first night and these were never replaced throughout our four day stay despite a telephone request to the reception. We eventually bought our own drinks and nibbles and happily stored these in the mini bar. A rather cheaper option but this may not be ideal depending on your point of view.

If you go out and right and across via Janiculum you get to the Tarpean cliff (the start of the Capitoline hill where criminals were hurled to their death. If you go up the steps you come out above the Roman Forum which is amazing. The hotel is literally minutes from most of the ancient Roman sights.

Via Petroselli is very busy, as are most roads in Rome and it does create some noise in the room - we were on a side street and it was still noisy in the early mornings. Rome The 47 hotel is the best location for ancient Rome although around the Pantheon is where I would stay next time because it is pedestrianised and more central to all of Rome. Our favourite area at night was around Piazza Navona and Piazza della Rotunda. Places to eat outside in Rome, in pedestriansed areas like this, are surprisingly rare, which is a shame. I would not stay near the Spanish steps, as many people suggest, because this area of Rome is busier and has less to do. I may be missing something but the steps are just steps covered in thousands of people who do not seem to have realised it is just steps and there is virtually no where to eat in the evening overlooking the piazza. Rome is amazing for its history and places like Piazza Navona but I was very surprised by the amount of (mad) traffic and the endemic graffitti.

Thought I had to write a review straight away. First of all, it's a great hotel- friendly, smart, clean, art deco, lovely rooms with great views, air conditioning, big bed and very comfortable pillows. Although it's right next to a big road it's completely soundproof, and it's only a few minutes walk to circus maximus and palatine hill. Almost all the tour buses stop in front of the hotel too! Anyway, you don't need me to tell you about all the great things about fortyseven, just read the other reviews. The bad points that annoyed me during my weekend there- the rooftop restaurant/ bar is not open for breakfast which is a shame. Breakfast was from 7:30 - 10:30am and ok, not that much choice. Scrambled eggs and fruit salad were obviously popular but were not replenished when I came down at 10:20 for a quick one. When I tried to sit in the courtyard was told by a staff member \"Inside!\" because there were trying to clean it up and obviously I was one of the later guests for breakfast. Oh, and the shower temperature was very delicate and difficult to control. If I sound like sour grapes, it's probably because I paid a lot of money for the hotel and was expecting a bit more. I know Rome is expensive, but I've had better experience in wonderful hotels in London, Berlin and Paris paying less than half of what I paid for at fortyseven.

We are a male gay couple in our 30's. We researched a lot online and through friends where to stay when in Rome, and placed a bet on 47 because of its strategic location near all the main monuments and sites of ancient Rome. We requested a quiet room when booking and were given room 101, on the first floor, facing a side street, which was indeed, very quiet; Via Luigi Petroselli is a main thoroughfare, I knew it'd be noisy from having been to Rome before. After the marvelous sights of the Amalfi coast we could have not made a better choice. My partner had not been to Rome before and I wanted him to have an unforgettable first time, everything is reachable by foot from the hotel, you can easily cover all the monuments in 1 1/2 day. The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable of their city, we got good recommendations to restaurants and the nightlife. Our room was spotless when we got in, and everyday left in excellent conditions, with a turnover service to top it all. The bathroom is marbled, with top notch hardware, their bath products are very good too. The furniture is kept in good condition, so are the bed linens, the bed was very comfortable too, it felt like a new or not-so-old mattress, a problem in hotels through Europe. The breakfast is varied and plentiful, and if you know a bit about the food industry, you know that when the coffee is good, there is attention to detail in the kitchen. The bar at the rooftop deck offers breathtaking views of the surroundings, their cocktails were good, dinner served by the restaurant was excellent. When we were there, there was no phone or internet service due to a problem in the neighboorhood, but in the end, this allowed us to completely disconnect for a few days more. The hotel building is very well kept, many old buildings like that smell of mold, but this one is definitely looked after, once you step in you feel like in a sanctuary away from the Roman traffic, the hotel walls are thick and the inner court is very quiet. I suspect the rooms facing the street are more noisy, though. Overall, we had one minor issue: delays with room service, not everyone in the kitchen speaks English, but efforts were promptly made to assist us and the food was freshly prepared. I would most probably stay there again when I return to Rome (no doubt I will return soon), I know now why so many rave about it and with reason, it is a great escape if you are in business, but also an excellent option for a romantic weekend. The high price tag is well worth if you are like us and wish to return to a comfortable bed and a pristine bathroom after a day sightseeing; and want guarantee of good drinks, excellent coffee and prompt professional service, the front desk staff and the conciergerie were impeccable at all times. Even though Rome has a reputation for not being a gay friendly city, we were at ease at all times, and the hotel staff made efforts to guide us to the nightilfe and beaches. There were absolutely no changes in attitude when asking about gay life in the city, to the contrary, more associates were contacted to ask about the latest places to go and things to do, this gave us an everlasting impression of warmth and goodwill that made us feel welcome, we would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Rome.", "Date": "July 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, NC", "Title": "\u201cLoved this hotel\u201d", "Author": "aagrawal", "ReviewID": "UR8222575", "Content": "We just returned from a trip to Italy and spent two nights at the Forty Seven Hotel that were wonderful.

Also nice, as pointed out by another reviewer, to come back at night to a new, fresh hotel room (an exception in Rome). Now the bad... You can't help but feel short changed when staying there. We paid $500 euros per night for a suite with 1 king and 1 queen for the kids. That is per night and in euros. You agree to that kind of price but you end up setting your expectations high because it is a lot of money even in Rome. The service from the front desk was extremely nice and courteous with the exception of one staff member and unfortunately that is all it takes to leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. Upon arrival we were basically greeted with a \"what are you doing here?\" because we were supposed to be picked up by a driver that was booked by the hotel, however we arrived in Rome 4 hours earlier. After trying unsuccessfully to call the hotel twice to let them know, we then decided to take a cab as we would be there at least 2 hours prior to the set time so we could simply cancel the transfer service upon arrival at the hotel but the staff member gave us some real attitude as to what she expected from us (a call from the airport). If you are the party paying the $500 per night you really don't find yourself in the mood to be questioned and getting some bad attitude from who should be welcoming you instead. Breakfast was OK. Another reviewer raved about the breakfast but I quite didn't get it. We stayed in 10 different hotels this trip. The Fortyseven was the most expensive hotel and their breakfast was quite frankly OK. They would run out of ham every 5 minutes and then take another 5-10 minutes to replenish the VERY small tray. There was one kind of cheese, 3 or 4 kinds of bread, scrambled eggs from the heated tray (as in NO omelet station), so that is why we can at the most rate their breakfast an OK (especially at $500 euros a night). All other cheaper hotels had better breakfast. On the second night we decided to try the hotel restaurant at the penthouse. BIG mistake. Overpriced, terrible service as in 1 and a half hour to bring the meal although there were no more than 4 other tables having dinner. After 1 and a half hour they forgot my son's spaghetti.

Also for the Vatican a bus stopped right outside the hotel which went to the Vatican. We booked tours with ANgel tours before we left and I would recommend this tour group. We used them for The colloseum and the Vatican aswell as a tour of the Panthonon which was free. Rome is in general an expensive city, however we went a walk across the river and found a supermarket to stock up on snacks and beer and wine,which was very cheap!

Prior to our arrival, the concierge Lesya was very helpful in arranging our airport transfer. Our driver was awaiting our arrival outside of baggage claim and promptly delivered us to the front door of the 47. At night, the Via Petroselli is fairly quiet and you would never know that you are just steps away from many of Rome's most famous sites including the Forum and Colleseum. The front desk staff took extra time during check in to explain a map of Rome and suggest several routes that we might consider taking to see all of the sites. Our room on the 5th floor, # 506 seemed to have one of the best locations in the hotel. The balcony overlooked Via Petroselli, the neighborhood of Trestavere and some lesser known monuments and had fantastic views of the surrounding area. In addition, the balcony was twice the size of those on either side and allowed for two sets of French doors to open into the room. The room was very modern and new and had all of the amenities you would expect to find in a four star hotel. Because of the great location, we walked everywhere with the exception of the Vatican, which we reached by a bus that stopped 20 ft from the front door of the hotel. The roof top restaurant had excellent views and was a nice place to relax with some wine and cheese after sightseeing. Breakfast every morning was much than your typical continental spread and included eggs, ham, caprese salad and cheeses among other choices. We had plans to take a day trip to Tuscany and the concierge was very helpful in making travel arrangements for us to Siena as well.(If you are interested in taking a wine tour in Tuscany, I can recommend the perfect tour with Franco Fadda. His website is [--]. You can read my review of his tour by searching Franco Fadda on this site) We highly recommend the Hotel 47 and would absolutely stay here the next time we are in Rome.

The location is easy walking distance to the Palatine Hill and Cicus Maximus, and not too bad a walk to the Roman Forum or even the Pantheon. The location is enough removed from the Roman mainstream that you are not immediately surrounded by tourists when you step out on to the street. The street on which the hotel fronts, Via Petroselli, is definitely noisy and quite busy. It is wide and the hotel itself is positioned so as to be almost directly across from the temples of Hercules Victor and Portunus. The roof top bar was not yet open when we stayed at Fortyseven as it was still early in the season, but I imagine that at night with the temples lit up, the view should be very nice, though the street noise will definitely be audible. We had a deluxe 4th floor room on the side of the hotel that is off Via Petroselli, so the street noise was much less a problem. The 5th floor of the hotel is all suites, each with a balcony overlooking Via Petrocelli. Our room was nicely appointed and the bathroom quite large by EU standards. Both the room and bath were clean and quite comfortable, including a large walk-in closet and room safe. TV was a large flat screen, high speed internet access via cable connection in the room with a large pull out desk with well positioned electrical sockets. Maid service was good and prompt each day. Unless you have a suite with a balcony, I would make sure to get a room on the side, since the windows are not especially large and you won't have much of a view, you might as well have a bit more quiet. Ear plugs would help. We tried to watch a pay-per-view movie one night, but the movie did not work, so the hotel immediately refunded the charge. Taxis appear in 5 minutes when called by the hotel and it's an easy 30 minutes to the airport by car. there were two floor tiles loose in the elevator the whole time we were there, which is a little unsettling when you first arrive and an obvious maintenance issue that should not have been overlooked. As indicated in other posts, the staff is bilingual and very friendly. The reception and front office staff are all very friendly and helpful. The food is not anything spectacular but certainly passable and the wait staff at dinner needs more training. the breakfast buffet is adequate but the breakfast room is rather crowded. Again, the wait staff seemed a bit short handed and tables were not cleared as rapidly as necessary given the numbers of people, but there was generally not a wait for a table. This may be alleviated if the center courtyard is opened for breakfast this time of year. By EU standards, this is a good hotel, larger than average rooms, modern decor and accompaniments. It's a new place in a very old city, close enough to the center but, as I indicated, not so far that you can't walk to most places of interest. In fact, in about a 10 minutes you can walk to the Circus Maximus and sit on the far side away from the Palatine Hill, and gaze on some of the oldest ruins in the Western world, all for free.

The food was both exquisite and beautifully presented. For example, their vegetable soup is made everyday with fresh vegetables. They served typical italian fare like bresaola and the breakfast buffet included excellent warm scrambled eggs, along with a fresh fruit salad, nothing from the can. The location is fantastic: a few steps away from the Forum, Campidoglio, Trastevere, temples and ruins of all kinds. The closests subway is Colosseum. A cab to go from hotel to the railway station is no more than 7 euros. The rooms have email available through the television, and they changed the sheets every single day, while following all sort of ecological measures to avoid waste. Everything they serve is organic. They carry a great selection of newspaper including the Herald Tribune. The clientele is mostly American couples and families, or groups of friends.

The only downsides: (1) the bathroom did not have a bath tub; However, it did have a gorgeous tiled shower with a huge glass door and rainmaker shower head, so we forgot about the tub relatively quickly. (2) The walls at this hotel are oddly thin and you really can hear everything next door. The breakfast buffet at the hotel was great; it included scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, cereals, fruit salad, yogurt, and deliciously sweet croissant. The coffee pot also came to the table with steamed, frothy milk which was quite a treat in the morning. You can also purchase Hop On/Hop Off Tour Bus tickets at the front desk and the bus stop is literally across the street from the hotel. (I recommend you use this bus at least once as Rome is somewhat difficult and dangerous to walk due to the sheer size of it, vespa drivers, cobblestones and amount of traffic). In terms of location, the hotel is not centrally located, although I am not sure where in Rome would be. It just seemed like a long walk to all of the atrractions and the metro really doesn't help. The hotel is, however, very close to Ancient Rome including the Roman Forum, Colosseum, and Circus Maximus as well as the Bocca della Verita.

The location is exceptional, across the street from the Mouth of Truth (Boca de Veritas). This is a small hotel with very nice rooms. We booked directly with the hotel and chose a large room because we needed luggage space and European hotel rooms are generally small. When we arrived, our large room was not available, so we were put in a smaller room for one night. Of course, the price was not adjusted to reflect the smaller room size! (The only negative to the entire experience). We had looked at over 100 properties before choosing the 47 and we chose well. While not inexpensive by American standards, the price was very good for central Rome. I believe we paid around $340 USD per night. When we did finally get to our larger room the next day, it was a view room on the front. We had a refrigerator which made bringing back wine or cheese very convenient. They have electric window and noise shutters so we only heard the loudest noises from the street and these were hardly noticeable. This property is across the street from numerous bus stops and the hop-off, hop-on tour bus stop. A great location. It is within easy walking distance of Campo di Fiore (5 minutes), Piazza Navona (10 minutes), the Forum and Coliseum (10 minutes), the Jewish Ghetto (10 minutes) and Trastevere (10 minutes). It is a quiet area with few street people, so is safe at night. As to the hotel facilities, everything worked in the room, but it did take us a bit to figure out that the room key had to be in the slot near the door for the electricity to work. the decor is stylish and modern. The hotel is clean and the personnel friendly. The hotel has a generous European style buffet breakfast and requests were promptly taken care of. There is wireless free internet in the lobby, although you need to get a sign-on code from the front desk. The concierge arranged both our airport pick-up and transport to the cruise ship. We had read of problems, so we were careful to confirm these arrangements and the exact logistics to meet our driver. It worked out fine and we enjoyed both rides with good drivers. Our Italian is limited and the drivers English was limited, but we hacked along in a combination of charades, Spanish, English and Italian supplimented by guide books and laughter. We would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a reasonably priced central Rome hotel. As to eating, we thoroughly enjoyed the Ristorante Pizzeria La Scala, Piazza della Scala 60 in Trastevere. We also dined one day in the Magnolia Cafe/Winebar/Lounge in Campo de' Fiori - I'd pass on this one, the food was mediocre and the service stunk. They acted like we owed them a favor. For a really fun local meal try the old Peroni factory which is near the Pantheon. No one speaks English and it is crowded and noisy. The food portions are generous, the beer really cold and the atmosphere is truly Italian business people at lunch! Loads of atmosphere and great decor. We did the hop-off, hop-on bus on Sunday.

We were very lucky in that the weather was lovely - shorts and t-shirts were all that was required. The accommodation was very good - the room was spacious and immaculately presented. The bathroom was spotlessley clean. On our return one evening we found a hotel t-shirt which they had left for my 8 year old daughter - a lovely touch ! The rooftop terrace bar and restaurant was a real treat for us. As the weather was so good we relaxed there each evening on our return from a busy day's sight seeing.

The Fortyseven Hotel is that place. The two-year old hotel was formerly an office building and you can tell that they must have gutted the place and started over. The shell of the building is intact, but everything else is modern and new\u2026and it works! The hotel has modern electronics, cooling and heating that actually work, and a great roof deck that boasts views of ancient Rome. The rooms have comfortable beds, hardwood floors, flat screen televisions, marble bathrooms, and, best of all, electronic shutters that block out light and sound. Luckily, the view is ancient, so that you can\u2019t forget that you\u2019re in Rome (our room looked out on the Temples of the Forum Boarium that date from the 2nd century BC). The great view from the roof top was by tasty food and drink \u2013 expensive, but worth it when you realize where you are. The hotel is not perfect, however: there was noise from other rooms \u2013 scraping sounds of furniture being moved in the room above \u2013 but this was a relatively minor distraction. Despite generally helpful advice, we regretted following the recommendation of the concierge on the night she made a reservation for us at a traditional Italian restaurant that seemed more New Jersey Turnpike than Rome. If you\u2019re interested in ancient Rome, this hotel is in a great location \u2013 the Capitoline Hill (and its museums), the Colosseum, the Forum, and the Circus Maximus are all nearby \u2013 and it\u2019s a short walk across the Tiber to the trendy neighborhood of Trastevere.

Others have not. 1) Location - yes, you can walk to everything -- in about 15-20 minutes. You are actually in the middle of nothing. There are no restaurants, clubs, etc... in the area that a tourist might expect, except for a bus station in front. I think I walked at least 15 minutes to find a simple ATM machine. 2) Noise - the walls are paper thin. Noises from adjacent rooms are not even muffled. I heard the Italian man in the room next to me perfectly, who appeared to be speaking in moderate tone. Also, I heard furniture moving, walking, showering, etc... of the room above me. This is not to mention the abundant street noise, because the windows provide absolutely no insulation. 3) Breakfast - Service was poor. There was no one to seat us. It took 15 minutes to flag down someone for hot beverages. They actually burnt my cappucino milk (I didn't realize you could physically burn milk). Selection was average. The eggs were unappetizing, the cheese, breads, etc... were standard fare. 4) Wireless - No wireless access in your room (if you can get your laptop charged). Instead, you need to inconveniently plug into a cord, extremely limiting your access. Wireless was avaialble downstairs through prepaid cards. When I went to purchase one such card, I was informed they were out. 5) Outlets - I am not sure how this is even possible, but their outlets were not powerful enough to power my laptop. It was fine in every other hotel, but I could not recharge my laptop here, unless it was powered off, in which case it would slowly recharge. 6) Nickel and diming - local phone calls are charged, lost room key (unidentifiable white plastic card) are charged .

So we got to enjoy it our first night there but it was not open the other 2 nights. So please be aware if you go in the winter months this is probably not available to you. The second problem was that we had 2 wake up calls that were 30 minutes late. What's the point of a wake up call if it's late? The second one was for the day we left so we could get to the airport in time, and we told them it was very important to get called on time and it was still a half hour late. Not a fun morning scrambling to get out of the hotel in time to make our flight. The room itself was very nice, very clean, and very comfortable. I particularly enjoyed the power window shades, that was pretty nice. The people above us for some reason seemed like they were into moving furniture in the middle of the night, not sure why, but that woke us up a few times, but that's not the hotel's fault. The breakfast was nice in the morning and pretty tasty, and the concierge and staff were nice and helpful. The location is pretty good too. So overall it's a nice place, a little expensive for what you get, but overall we were just disappointed in the circus bar closing and the wake up calls not being on time.", "Date": "November 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Various, USA", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel in Rome\u201d", "Author": "Frqnt_Traveler", "ReviewID": "UR6086285", "Content": "Forty Seven Hotel was wonderful!

Trevi Fountain, the Pantheon, and the Spannish Steps were a little further, but still very close (we actually walked too far the first time we went there, because we didn't expect it to be as close as it was). The Vatican was the furthest away, but we still walked with no problem and enjoyed getting the fresh air. For some, the vatican might be a bit far, but if you don't mind walking, it's not bad at all.

What separates Rome from the others are the ruins, in particular the Palatine and Forum, which are located directly behind the Fortyseven hotel. What also made our stay great was the warm staff, large room (and bath) and fabulous rooftop restaurant and bar at the hotel. While \"pricey\" to some, it was no where near the prices of the Hotel de Rusie where we had a wonderful lunch one day. The rooftop restaurant/bar alone was worth the price of our stay. We walked the city each day and returned at sunset each night to enjoy the views of the ruins around the hotel, the sunsets behind the Roman hills beyond and the comfy but luxurious atmosphere. The two (of the five) nights that we ate dinner at the hotel, the food was above average -- even for Rome. In particular, the carpaccio and grilled squid were excellent. Our room was spacious -- larger than your typical european hotel and was spare and modern, which I prefer. The room and bath were spotless and came with oversize toiletries. We also enjoyed the breakfast each morning. They always had scrambled eggs, bacon and the usual assortment of cheese, breads, cereals and juices you typically find at a European buffet. Unlike other reviewers, we had no problems getting coffee service. We used the concierge for dinner reservations one night -- gracious and adept service. And because we had an early departure, we booked a car with the hotel to take us to the airport at 5 a.m.-- again, no problems.

Based on many reviews on Trip Advisor our expectations were very high but, unfortunately, were not always met. We booked a deluxe room several months in advance and asked for a room with terrace if possible or at least a room on a higher floor. On check in, we were shown to a room on the 3rd floor but were informed shortly after going to the room that there was a problem with it's internet connection and were moved to a room on the first floor (second if you're North American). This room was larger and nicer than the first one we were shown but not my idea of \"deluxe\". When I inquired about switching to a room on an upper floor, I was told that the hotel was full and nothing else was available. The room was quite large for Rome and the bathroom was fine with a large tiled shower but no tub. Closer inspection revealed a bit of mildew in the hard to clean areas of the shower but other than that the room and bathroom were very clean. The room turned out to be quite noisy from the traffic and the metal shutters did not keep all of the noise out. It only bothered us one night but if you're a light sleeper, you really need a room on the upper floors. The hotel is very well located if you like walking. The Vatican is the furthest of the major tourist sites from the hotel and it's only a 30 minute walk along the Tiber. Most major sites are within 15 or 20 minutes. The disadvantage of the location is a lack of convenient cafes or bars. The food and drink at the hotel are only of average quality and very expensive. The exception is a good buffet breakfast although the service at breakfast is very spotty. However, generally, the hotel staff were very good, especially the concierges and front desk. We opted to have the hotel send a car to pick us up at the airport and this proved to be an excellent option. 50 euros but well worth it.

The room is spotless with light color hardwood floors throughout, and it comes with a very comfortable king size bed, and is furnished with contemporary pieces and decorated with original art work. The room is not very large, but large enough to be comfortable. The marble bathroom is modern and bright with high quality toiletries and towels.

The hotel also has a \"living room\" at the lobby level where you can read newspapers or use your laptops if it has wifi capabilities. Staff was helpful and courteous. The entire hotel is modern and cool, but not a \"scene\". The hotel is conveniently located near Ancient Rome. We toured the entire Ancient Rome/Colosseum/Imperial Rome area on foot from the hotel. To give you an idea of distance, it takes about 10 minutes walking north to reach Piazza Venezia, and from there it's another 10 minutes going south along Via dei Fori Imperiali (which is line with ancient ruins) to get to Colosseum. But there are shortcuts before you reach Piazza Venezia, where you can go up to the Capitoline museum and have a great view of the entire Ancient Rome. The hotel is also close to the Tiber River across from Trastevere, an area that's lively at night with great restaurants and bars.

The facilities, the food, the location, the bar, and the staff are all simply outstanding. In the interest of full disclosure, I must explain that our visit got off to a bit of a rocky start, with our rooms - reserved 5 months in advance - somehow being unavailable when we arrived. However, Marco, the Fortyseven Hotel manager, had already arranged other rooms for us at the Trilussa Palace Hotel - a lovely, very accomodating, above-average hotel, but not nearly as luxurious or in as spectacular a location as Fortyseven Hotel. Within 24 hours, Marco had our room at Fortyseven sorted out, and sent a car to bring us back. We were stunned at the lengths to which he went to make up the error to us. He arranged for our party of four to be upgraded to the two penthouse suites, which had massage chairs, huge bathrooms, sitting areas, and, best of all, incredible wrap-around balconies with unbelievable views of the temples of Apollo and Athena, the Palatine, and Teatro Marcello. He sent up bottles of champagne, comped our delicious breakfasts, and made dinner reservations for us at one of the best restaurants I've ever been to in my life. We were completely pampered by Marco, Sergio the bartender, and the entire Fortyseven Hotel staff for our remaining two days in Rome. Upon our return to Rome a week later, we tried to upgrade our regular rooms to the suites again (cost be darned - it's worth it!), but they were unavailable. Nonetheless, our regular rooms turned out to be wonderful, too - spacious, elegant, and with every amenity. The bathrooms were stocked with huge fluffy towels, luxury bath products, hair dryer, towel warmer, and more. Every area of the Hotel - both rooms and public areas, was sparkingly clean. The laid-back and luxurious open-air lounge on the roof of the Hotel was the perfect place for a bottle of wine and a relaxing read before dinner each night and for a nightcap in the evening. On our last night, the young lady staffing the front desk sent my husband and I to Vinando - a thoroughly authentic and very romantic restaurant just a few steps from the Hotel. The location of the Hotel couldn't be better - and the view has to be seen to be believed - it feels like you can see all of Rome without ever leaving the roof!

We stayed there for three nights and received excellent service and a very welecoming stay. Our room was on the second floor and despite other members complaining about the noise from the road, we did not consider this a problem. Once you have closed the electric shutters this not only acts as a black out but keeps the traffic noise out as well. Breakfast at the 47 is a nice and relaxing start to the day, the choice is ample and the relaxation music playing in the courtyard whilst having breakfast is a nice touch. When we arrived at the airport, instead of booking the hotel car, we got the coach from the airport (Terravision) to the Termini. Once at the Termini walk round to the bus station bit and catch the 170 bus, tickets are available at the newsagents opposite the bus stands. I think it is the 5th stop, which is right outside the hotel. This is certainly much cheaper than the 50 euros for the hotel car but we did book this to return to the airport which was in a very nice Mercedes Benz. The Rooftop bar is a must, although expensive you get excellent views over the city and the chilled and laidback atmosphere is a perfect end to an evening. Tour bus 101 is very good as you can jump on and off through out the day, reception sell tickets for this. Ladies - wear flat and sensible shoes, I though I could get away with a trendy pair of wedges but they are just no good on the streets which are all cobbled! I would strongly recommend Vinando restaurant which is situated Piazza Margana street (www.vinando.net).

You can easily walk to the Trevi Fountain and Castle Sand Angelo from the hotel as well (although this takes a little longer and get yourself a good map!). Taxi's are cheap in Rome - from Forty Seven to the Vatican, it cost less than 10 Euros so properly best to save those legs ! We arrived when the Pope was meeting the flock (this takes place on a Wednesday) and nearly got caught up in it all when we wanted to go to the Sistine Chapel - to get to the Chapel, you need to go right of the Vatican. Get there early ie 8:30am or before and you will miss the que, otherwise you could be waiting for 2-3 hours. We found two fantastic restaurants - both within easy walking distance of the Forty Seven. One was called the Alle Fratte Di Trastevere and is in the Trastevere area. The food here was typical Italian fare and was fantastic and was very reasonably priced. To get here from the Forty Seven, you turn right out of the hotel until the first set of traffic lights. Cross over at the lights and walk up the hill, turn right and on the left is the first bridge you come across - walk across this and then when you get to another smaller bridge you walk over that as well. When you get to the road turn right and keep walking until you get to the next bridge. Turn left and walk up the Viale Trastevere - cross over on the right hand side of the road (you should see Trams). You will have to walk approximately 3 blocks until you reach Via Luciano Manara - turn right up here and the restaurant is just up on the right. They do not open on Wednesdays. The first time we went there we had a 3 course meal with wine for 34 Euros !!!! The other restaurant we would recommend is Ristorante Galeassi which is in Piazza S Maria in Trastever 3 - you get here by following the above and then take the first right and keep walking. When you get to the square you will see it right in front of you. We had a 3 course meal with wine (lots of wine!) for 50 Euros. This restaurant does not open on Mondays. Someone recommended for ladies not to wear heels, my wife agreed with this as the majority of roads are cobble stones.

I am so glad I did as everything about the hotel was just what I was looking for. I deliberately wanted somewhere away from the very busy tourist areas but close enough to some excellent restaurants and bars - Forty Seven fits the bill. Well worth arranging with the hotel for a driver to pick you up at the airport - this saves so much time and hassle. The hotel is a modern design with the most helpful desk and staff - welcoming and informative. The rooms continue the modern design so if you are looking for ancient antiques look somewhere else. My room faced the road which was a plus as you feel part of the city - you can block out the noise using the shutters if preferred. 5 minutes walk out of the hotel leads you to the Forum or Trastevere across the bridge. Just strolling along the Tiber outside of the hotel gives you a great perspective of the city. A must is a drink on the rooftop bar - after the inevitable walking during the day it is an oasis of calm with wonderful views, definitely the place to relax with a prosecco or 2!

We chose it largely on the basis of great reviews on Tripadvisor. We were VERY happy with the choice. A little expensive perhaps, but it\u2019s that time of year and it is \u2018Roma\u2019 \u2013 BTW the location was ideal. From the moment we arrived and throughout our whole stay, the spotlessly clean and quiet room, the wonderful breakfasts, the excellent restaurant recommendations (particularly Giggetto\u2019s and Il Pastarellaro), the umbrella when we needed it, the cute little bar, we LOVED this hotel. Great service, great staff \u2013 it would be hard to find nicer and more helpful people than Francesca and Marco and the others whose names regretfully we didn\u2019t record. Forget being near the overrated and very crowded Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps with touristy restaurants with 'American' menus - rather be adjacent to the Coliseum, the Capitoline Museums, the Roman Forum and a short walk over the river to Trastevere for wonderful restaurants and the beautiful Santa Maria in Trastevere, there was even an ATM nearby. You can walk a good portion of Rome from here (including the Trevi) except perhaps the Vatican & St Peter\u2019s and the most Northerly sites. While walking you can stop for lunch along the way (pizza, caprese salad, etc.). In fact there are so many sites it is so easy to keep walking and forget how far you\u2019ve gone \u2013 even as members of the AARP crowd we ended up at Castel Sant\u2019 Angelo, but it\u2019s only a 10 Euro ride back. If it is in the budget, splurge about $500 (50 Euro an hour) and get a private guide when you do go to the Vatican and St Peter's - Silvia Rossetti was wonderful, a great recommendation from the hotel. You could spend a week at the museums. Two small tips - it\u2019s useful to be able to name the hotel and street in Italian; and ignore the initial indifference of the waiters \u2013 smile, attempt a little Italian and be appreciative of this wonderful city \u2013 it will win a lot of smiles back and a great experience. Thanks to all at the 47, we will definitely be back. P.S. We returned to the hotel after traveling to Portofino and Monte Carlo to stay a night (Room 212 at the front of the building) and day before returning to the USA. We were concerned at first about the front (street side) room but it was well insulated and, with the windows closed, there was little noise from the traffic.

Basically, its in a shabby neighborhood with a ton of traffic all around. If you've come to Rome to see the sights, you will end up walking all day, everywhere, and this is too far from the better areas.

Also ladies bring nothing only comfortable shoes even for the evening. To walk the short distance over to the Trastevere in the evening for a meal is difficult even with the smallest heels as there is nothing only cobblestones.

Its location is excellent, as are the rooms, facilities and to an extent the staff. The reason for the terrible review is that out of the three nights we paid to stay in the hotel, we only actually slept there once. Due to \"flooding problems\" we were transferred to another hotel, which was dated, dilapidated and completely inferior. Also, when we finally checked into the hotel, a cursory inspection showed no flood damage, no signs of flooding, and when other travellers in a similar predicament were consulted we had all been given differing excuses. In effect they double booked us, lied to our faces and then fobbed us off with an \"overspill hotel\" for two of our three nights in Rome, presumably for a tidy profit. I am an experienced traveller, and having backpacked across much of the world I have learnt that the maxim \"you get what you pay for\" is sound. I am sure it would have also been applicable in the case of Summit 47, if having paid for the hotel for three nights we were housed there for the duration. Instead, having forked out for three nights in a four star luxury hotel (which undoubtedly the summit is), we were given one, and two evenings in a dated, fawlty towers like establishment with a mediocre meal thrown in as compensation. In light of the other excellent reviews the hotel has received, which to a certain extent have been reinforced by our experiences, I have to concede that the quality of the establishment and its location are second to none. However, I would personally be very wary about booking there again because of the way that we were treated. This young hotel is obviously double booking to ensure it is full to capacity and is willing to inconvenience its customers in order to turn a profit. I would therefore recommend erring on the side of caution and booking at one of Rome\u2019s other excellent hotels. Rome is a wonderful city; my girlfriend and I rate it as one of the best places we have ever visited. I fully recommend anyone reading this review to visit the historic capital, indeed I will return later this year, and if you like to gamble book with the summit 47.", "Date": "March 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Weston-super-Mare", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Fortyseven\u201d", "Author": "Scolsie", "ReviewID": "UR4624061", "Content": "After so many good reviews myself and girlfriend booked at the Fortyseven Hotel for our 6 night stay in Rome. We were impressed the moment we pulled up in the taxi outside, it was a very smart and modern looking hotel, someone met us as the taxi pulled up and welcomed us and took our bags to our room, 409. I was a little concerned about the reports of the road noise, but I am a light sleeper and the traffic didn't bother me at all. The rooms come with superb blinds that you can lower or raise with a switch at either side of the bed, the blinds completely blacken the room and on the first morning when we raised the blinds to find out that it was infact daylight and we had missed breakfast, alarm set from then on. Rooms were very smart as was toilet which had a lovely sized shower. Loved the breakfast and there was plenty of staff keeping the breakfast items topped up if they ran low, they would also take your order if you wanted tea/coffee etc. In the evening reception would always order us a taxi when we wanted to go out for a meal (couldn't get to grips with the buses). The only gripe that we had and the reason that I have given a 4 rating is the attitude of a lady on reception on our final night. It was about 1900 and I looked out of our window to find that the road had been sealed off and there was a number of police vans and officers with shields stood right outside the hotel, after 10 minutes or so lorries with huge sound systems appeared to the left with hundreds of followers, the bass made our windows vibrate and I don't exagerate when I say it was as loud as being at Notting Hill carnival. As the Police had no intentions of moving the rave on that was taking place next to the hotel my girlfriend phoned reception to find out just how long we were going to have to endure half a dozen lorries blasting out drum and bass music that was drowning out the tv. We were informed by reception that it was a demonstration about the punishment handed out in Rome for carrying marijuana and would be gone in half an hour, that came and passed so we again phoned reception and the lady point blank refused to move us to a quieter room and told us to go out for a meal and it would all be gone when we got back. We were dumbstruck by the attitude that we shouldn't enjoy our last night in our \u20ac190 a night room but go out for a meal, the receptionist said on one hand she had no other complaints from guests and on the other told us that everyone else was out to dinner, maybe then that's why there had been no other complaints. We were also told that we should go outside and have a word with the police officers or maybe have a word with the Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi as he was in Rome, really this attitude dissapointed us, being sorry and telling us that all the rooms were full would have been better advised. Although we experienced problems, that was with one member of staff only, the rest were very polite and helpful and would have no hestation in recommending Fortyseven Hotel, only a short walk from the Trastevere and unlike everywhere else in Rome very clean, there was a member of staff vaccuming the pavement when we came back one afternoon!", "Date": "March 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location\u201d", "Author": "EveLorraine", "ReviewID": "UR4607151", "Content": "Stayed here for 2 nights before staying at the Westin Excelsior.

Hotel was not noisy at all at night if you closed the window shutter. However, as one reviewer noted, you can here some noise from other rooms (someone in an adjoining room was practically yelling.) 2. The bar is always empty - likely because of the stupid price of a drink - 12 euros for a gin and tonic. This really bugged me. In talking to fellow guests, this was annoying for many and it appears that the hotel is missing an opportunity here because we bought wine for the room or went elsewhere for drinks. 3. On the suggestion of Trip Advisor people we did not use the hotel's recommendation from the tour company (thanks). Instead the hotel made arrangements for a car and driver to Pompeii. It was expensive (550 euros) but worth every penny. Ask the hotel to arrange for Angelo as your driver - he suggested we go to Sorrento for lunch after seeing Pompeii - a great side trip. 4. Clearly the reviewer who raved about the breakfast was from someplace with atrocious food. It was ok - lots of it but nothing to write home about. Toast would have been nice. 5.

While almost everything good that people have said about the hotel is true, I am only giving it three stars because of the noise problem, which is quite significant. If you are a light sleeper or would be annoyed by spending a lot of money only to hear the constant roar of traffic outside your windows all night long, then you do not want to stay here. While some readers have mentioned the in window shutters as cutting down the noise, they do not eliminate it. They also make the room pitch black, which cuts out any Roman midnight light which you might want to peak through your windows. Despite what the reader from London says below, there are no inside rooms--the layout has all the rooms looking out on the streets, with the corridor in the inside. The superior rooms that were written about are not on the high floors but are the corner rooms on each floor, so that there are windows on two sides. Also, the way each floor is designed, if you look at the floor plan, you can see that superior rooms have bathrooms and closets on both sides of their walls, thereby elimininating the problem that some readers have had getting room noise through the walls. Aside from the noise, the hotel is very nice. It's new, in a boutique style but still tasteful too. Everything is brand new and works well, and the hotel is also very, very clean. Each bathroom has one outlet for US plugs, so you don't need to bring a converter with for small appliances or chargers. Expedia mentions that each room has a clock radio, which is not true, but they do have a programmable alarm on the TV which slowly turns on. There is a wake up service but the phones give the impression that it is automated when you have to actually call down to the desk and they will write down your request for the next morning. Likewise, the TV gives you the impression that you can access the internet through your room which is not true. You need to buy a card and then use one of the two high speed connection computers in the sitting area on the first floor. While some others have complained about the rates, it was pretty comparable to situations I've found in other places in terms of paying for Internet access (10 Euros for 60 minutes). I also called back to the US several times using the direct dial phones, and the rates for evening calls were quite reasonable by hotel standards--seemed to be about 1 Euro for the first minute and fractional charges after that. The breakfast spread was pretty good, and while maybe not up to American buffet standards, it's the best breakfast we've seen after several trips to Italy. The hours are long also, and last until 10:30 AM, which is unusual. If you want true cappucino and or latte, make sure to ask for Italian coffee, which will be stronger than the \"American\"coffee which they normally serve if you don't specify what you want. The staff is friendly and helpful, and quite geared towards an English speaking clientele. Don't take their recommended tour company, of which the brochures look pretty tacky, but instead find one on your own and then either call yourself (every place in Rome geared towards tourism speaks English) or have the hotel call for you. Context Rome and Through Eternity Tours were two good companies that we used. If you need a taxi, the hotel has a computer terminal where they punch in the information and give you a receipt with the name of the taxi and its estimated arrival time, usually no more than five minutes in off peak hours. In Rome, when you call for a taxi by radio, which you need to do unless you're right at a taxi stand, the taxi starts the meter on the way to pick you up. The one morning we called for a taxi at 8 AM, it took a while for the cab to get there and that part of the fare was more than our actual ride. The rooftop is beautiful, but the prices as noted are expensive. However, when we inquired about wine, one very nice bartender suggested that we buy a bottle instead of wine by the glass or mixed drinks, and then suggested that we take the rest to out room, which we did and stashed in our minibar. So instead of paying 12, 15, or 20 Euros for a mixed drink, we paid 18 Euros for a great bottle of wine and had it for two nights (although we drank it in our room on the second night:) Finally, as others have noted, the location is superb. An easy walk to downtown, the Colisseum, the Ghetto, and the Trastevere neigborhood. We stumbled into a fabulous restaurant/wine bar in the Ghetto, which has been mentioned by others-Vinando, where we had the best lunch of the week.

The hotel is very well located for most of the major attractions in Rome. The only downside to its location is that it is on a very busy road, and road noise can be heard in the rooms which some people have already pointed out in other reviews on this site. We stayed in a deluxe room, however I was led to believe the deluxe rooms were located on the higher floors, but our deluxe room was on the 1st floor which was a little disappointing as the road noise was more apparent but you have to get used to it and accept that the lower the floor you are located on, the closer to the road and the noise you will be. So my advice if you are going to stay at the forty seven and are given a room on the lower floors is you may want to ask if there are other rooms available on higher floors. The hotel itself and the rooms are very very clean and modern. The rooms are very spacious and I thought the bathroom was fantastic and the large walk in shower was amazing. The only downside to the room was the lack of storage available for cloths. The minimalist look of the rooms the forty seven has achieved is great, but lets not forget that people need to put their cloths somewhere. The room only had a wardrobe with 3 small draws inside and 6 coat hangers, enough only for 1 persons suitcase at best. But overall the rooms are great, very modern, stylish and clean, the electric shutters on the windows controlled from within your room was a very clever idea. The hotel staff are very nice and always welcome you with a smile so you will feel very welcome at the forty seven. Breakfast was average I thought. There is a large choice but the only hot food was scrambled egg, mini frankfurters and very fatty bacon. Also there are less tables and chairs than guests inside and you may find when you go down for breakfast there is no space. However we went in winter when it was too cold to sit outside but if you go in summer there are chairs and tables outside so space would not be an issue. Overall I enjoyed staying at the forty seven and thought it was a very nice hotel, but personally I think it is very overpriced for what you actually get and probably would try another hotel if I was to go back to Rome. But I would give the forty seven 4 out of 5 for the hotel itself, but think the price you pay is not justified for what you actually get overall.", "Date": "November 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles, ca", "Title": "\u201cwonderful\u201d", "Author": "Temporary", "ReviewID": "UR4124558", "Content": "This was the first hotel we stayed in on our honeymoon.

We placed a reservation with Hotels for 3 nights at Hotel 47, commencing 28th May 2005. On arrival at reception, we were told that our room was unavailable. We were very quickly ushered out of reception and taken to a nearby apartment block for a one night stay. This was not the 1st time that Hotel 47 had used the apartment block as an over-spill facility. We moved into Hotel Forty Seven on the 29th May, and were provided with a complimentary meal and glass of wine, along with at least one other couple that had been double-booked. The meal was mediocre, if it had been good I would tell you so. I complained to the Duty Manager and explained that we\u2019d specifically chosen Hotel 47 and had not wanted to stay elsewhere, and certainly not in an apartment where our view from the window consisted of a huge assembly containing air handling units. Reasons for the double-booking ranged from someone being intoxicated and couldn\u2019t move from the room, to it being due to an air-traffic control strike, to it simply being a double-booking. But to cut a long story short, we were never given any satisfactory answers. Subsequent to our stay I wrote to Hotel 47 on a number of occasions asking for explanations. It has taken five months for them to respond, and then they only responded after I copied in the Summit Group in London and asked for their assistance. But Hotel 47 has failed to answer any of my key points and I\u2019ve given up trying. I\u2019d be interested to hear a Management Response on this subject.

This was an excellent hotel from the lovely foyer to the fabulous rooms. We had booked a deluxe room as it was our 20th wedding anniversary and after being allocated the wrong room at first (not sure if the hotel staff would have changed us if we hadn't queried our room allocation) but both rooms were lovely but the deluxe had the benefit of a balcony with table and chairs and this gave us the opportunity to watch the world go by. The rooms had small special touches such as slippers which were great after longs days out sightseeing. The breakfasts in the morning were great from the fresh fruit salad, ham and cheeses, scrambled eggs and bacon to rolls and pastries and this set you up for long days seeing Rome. We ventured up to the rooftop bar and the views were fab and you could even see the top of St Peter's at night however did find it a bit expensive with most drinks ranging from 12 to 15 euros each this was for beers to champagne cocktails. One or two things about Rome that would have helped us before hand and may help anyone else in the future. The 110 tour bus round Rome stops just down from the hotel but please have exact change as they don't seem to have any change!! and we ended up giving them an extra 2 euros or we wouldn't have got on otherwise so be warned, nice little earner for them. If you want to have the audio guides for St Peter's etc please remember to take some form of identification as you will need this to get them out. We didn't have any credit cards etc and missed out on this. Must say though felt very safe walking around Rome even in the evening. We walked everywhere as the hotel is in a good spot. It took us 35 minutes to the Vatican walking at a reasonable pace so really you don't need to use any other transport if you really want to see Rome. I would recommend a lovely Sicilian restaurant called Trattoria \"Melo\" on via Magnanapoli it is half way up a set of stairs on this road near the Foro di Traiano, the staff were lovely and the meal cost 80 euros for starters, steaks with veg, side salad and a good bottle of Chianti and a couple of drinks.

But the staff was conscientious, the room was clean and reasonably big (by European standards) and the included breakfast was amazing (again, by European standards). We'd asked for an early check-in since we knew we'd be arriving in Rome at dawn, and the staff had our room ready when we arrived. A blessing, to be sure. Caveat: when we read the hotel overlooked the \"Temple of Vesta\", we assumed we'd be looking down on the Roman Forum's Temple of Vesta. In reality, the hotel is a few blocks from the Forum and the \"temple\" we looked at was another lesser monument across the street from the hotel. This building/ruin? is also called the \"Temple of Vesta\", but it is not THE Temple of Vesta inside the Roman Forum. The view was pleasant but not what we'd expected. The rooftop wine bar was delightful for sipping wine & cheese -- spectacular views of the city -- and should not be missed. However, if you're interested in dinner, I'd go elsewhere. Not much choice and too expensive. Other comments: do not trust the hotel staff to set up tours for you. We asked the concierge to arrange both a private walking tour of the Roman Forum and a group tour of Vatican City. Both were overpriced and dreadful, especially the group tour of the Vatican. On our 3rd day, we found a group on our own called Eternal City Tours and I cannot say enough about the company. They give free tours in English at various monuments in Rome and if you like what they do, they invite you to take one of their paid tours of other sites. We took their free tour of St. Peter's and came back for a paid walking tour at night of Rome that was the best tour we've ever taken. If we'd known about them, we would have arranged all of our \"Rome\" tours through them, as they offer a variety of group tours, as well as private & customized tours. Interestingly, though, when I asked the hotel staff to book the walking tour of Rome at night for us with the company we'd found, they balked, choosing instead to send us (again) to their \"preferred\" touring group.", "Date": "September 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service\u201d", "Author": "gedwards100", "ReviewID": "UR3895877", "Content": "I admit that being upgraded to a junior suite may have affected my opinion of this hotel but the experience was still superb.

Rooms are often shabby and cramped and the service provided by the staff is anything but inspired. Not so at the Forty Seven in Rome. This place is an absolute revelation. Hoteliers world wide could learn a thing or two about their industry by checking in at the 47 for a night. Despite the fact that we arrived early in the morning after a gruelling multi-layover trip, the front desk had a room waiting for us on the top floor, complete with a balcony, just as I had requested. While the room was on the smaller side - because of the generously-sized balcony, they explained - it was extremely well-appointed with high-quality, modern furnishings and linens. The bathroom was spacious by European standards and featured a full tub, plenty of counter space, toilet, and bidet. Counters and floor were in marble or some sort of beautiful light-colored stone and the fixtures themselves were modern and of the highest quality. As I mentioned, we arrived early in the morning and were in need of sleep. The balcony doors featured a metal shutter that could be rolled down at the touch of the button. The effect was an absolutely dark and silent sanctuary for severely jet-lagged travelers. Other reviewers have mentioned that breakfast was fine, but nothing special. While it was certainly not gourmet, it offered a wide selections of pastries, breads, meats, yogurts, cereals, scrambled eggs, and bacon. Consiering it is included in the price of the room, I can't complain at all. Everything was fresh and delicious. I didn't eat at their restaurant, but did have a glass of wine on the marvelous rooftop bar. Sure, it was expensive, but this is a hotel, after all, and the wine was excellent. For all of its spectacular features, what made the 47 truly stand out was its staff. Without exception, the staff was eager, friendly, and accomodating. When I asked the front desk for an umbrella at 5:00 AM, explaining I was going out for a walk beacause I couldn't sleep, they showed grave concern that perhaps something was wrong with my room and asked if they could help in any way. When I explained it was only jet lag, they still persisted, making sure I had absolutely everything I needed to make myself comfortable. (In the end, the sunrise walk through Rome was all I needed. I highly recommend waking early and going for a stroll. The streets are quiet and deserted and you're free to see Rome in all its glory.) In short, the 47 is a smashing success.

Overall, I would recommend this place, but dont count on them to help you in all situations -- go there prepared already!", "Date": "May 15, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Fortyseven Hotel Rome", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d319527-Reviews-Fortyseven_Hotel_Rome-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$236 - $435*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Luigi Petroselli 47</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00186</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "319527", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f4/0c/f40c528c2dd533eea43fa4dc4aa54ea01large.jpg"}}
