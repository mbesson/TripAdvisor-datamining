While very difficult to locate, the property is located in beautiful surroundings. However, the lack of attention to detail makes this hotel, at best, a 2 or 3 star property. For instance: 1. Our room's (room 214) air conditioning vent was obscured by the curtain for the window. Since the room overlooked the front entrance to the hotel, we had the choice of leaving the curtain open so as to cool the room (with the result of having the outside lights stream into the room), or closing the curtain and thereby cutting off the cool air flow (resulting in a very warm room). 2. The \"period\" pieces in the room (the dresser, minibar, etc.) were not well maintained. The doors to these items would not shut flush, and the handle to one of the doors actually fell off during our stay. 3. The lighting in the room was extremely poor, making the room quite dark. 4. The bathroom was tiny, and not representative of a top flight hotel. All in all, this hotel did not justify the high ratings given it by other reviewers, at least during our brief stay.

Our deluxe room (general description for what we term a standard) was large and well furnished. It was lovely and very well maintained-unlike some other '';classic' hotels I've stayed at in Italy. Everyone had a different style room on a differnt level owing to the restrictions of the ancient architecture. We arrived late from our travels and dinner was waiting or us.

The service was satisfactory and they were cordial even when we kept them up late in the small bar as we unwound from our drive. TIP: If you know Rome then you would be aware that staying outside makes it difficult to get into town and parking is also a nightmare.

My partner and I were so excited about our 5-day trip having read all the great reviews and seen all the beautiful photos but when we arrived, we felt like we'd been duped. The rooms were not nearly as lavish as the pictures had suggested, the facilities were largely out of use for our stay, e.g. the swimming pool and the cafe area upstairs, despite it being really hot. The gym was also very small and smelly and the breakfasts were rubbish, really rubbish. There was very little selection and the quality of the food was terrible and we had Abba playing every morning! When wandering around the grounds, everything seemed to be in a state of disarray and we got the distinct impression that this is just not the place to go off season or before the end of May. There was an organised party in the hotel on one night and only then did the staff seem to make an effort. Overall, we felt this place had enormous potential but fell well short on what it had promised to deliver. The decor was awful and cheap and tacky looking and there were nasty, dusty fake flowers everywhere. It would have made such a difference if these had been real but no real effort was made anywhere. The only real plus point which was also a negative was the fact that the hotel is in the middle of nowhere and it is a very long walk to the nearest train station in the local town (which seemed very sweet) so although it was nice not to be staying in the centre of Rome, it was a mission to get into town (an hour to an hour and a half's journey) and as we were there over Easter, this was more difficult than usual. It was also very expensive to get back to the hotel from the city centre with taxis costing around \u00a325. So it was either this or get the last train and shuttle back to the hotel around 10pm.

We wanted to stay in a hotel that would match the grandeur of the wedding, and the Castello della Castelluccia was no diasappointment! 13 of us in the wedding party stayed in beautifully furnished bedrooms (as the married couple we were upgraded to a suite with a fireplace and jacquzzi bath at no extra cost by the management). The details of the hotel were more akin to a 5 star hotel in the UK, complete with bath robes and slippers in each bathroom. The decor was just fabulous, as our family slept in rooms with four poster beds and frescos. We ate a delicious meal on the evening of our wedding, and the chefs were happy to cater for our veggie family members. The surrounding lawns, orange trees and castle interior are perfect for photographs. The only inconvenience was the location outside central Rome, but the hotel is very close to the Metro which connects in 20-30 minutes to Metro line A, which is perfect for the sightseeing stops of St Peters, Spanish Steps, Trevi fountain etc. There is a courtesy bus that brings you from the metro back to the hotel 6 times a day, times were a bit inconvenient but as we were a large party we just agreed in advance when to arrive back in the evening. The suburban location also made it fantastic value - I imagine we would have paid excessive amounts of money to stay in a similar hotel in the centre of rome. The spa, with turkish baths and a sauna included in the price of the accommodation, was also a fantastic way to chill out before and after the big day, during times when members of the wedding party could not face sightseeing trips!

We like our creature comforts and very rarely stay below 3 stars so when we saw that three nights at the Castello would be les than three hundred pounds and was four stars as well we booked straight away in Nov 07. We booked through Lastminute.com and selected a deluxe double with spa and continental breakfast. When we set off on a driving tour of Italy some 10 months later I took into account recent reviews that mentioned the hotel being hard to find. I printed off the Google arial photo of the hotel and surrounding roads as well as programming it into my sat nav. We arrived in Rome around 2pm via the A1 motor way and the city ring road. As the sat nav counted down to less than two miles to go we spotted the first of many signs to the hotel and followed it - straight into a dead end. A housing estate had been built since the photo used by google had been taken or the software for my satnav had been written. Several false trys led nowhere but dead ends. We therefore ignored the satnav and tried another of the roads on the map. Again as we got near there were more signs but this time the road ended in a quarry. A third attempt coming in from the north along Via Cassia finally got us to the hotel, after an hour of driving around and around. Sorry to go on but this set the scene for the rest of the stay. The former castle is certainly an impressive sight but from the outside has no signage at all to indicate where the front door is or directions to reception. Only a delivery taking place gave away that the heavy iron gates in the front of the building are the main door. The reception staff were typically Italian in their aloof manner and made us feel that I was an inconvenience to their work. The member of staff dealing with us even ignored us for a moment to sign the delivery mans papers despite three other members of staff standing around. When we got to our room it was stiflingly hot. The A/C had not been switched on. Further more our prebooked spa bath was a bog standard one under the window with a shower over it. I went straight back to reception to query this. I was told in a very matter of fact way that Lastminute.com had incorrectly listed the room facilities and that the hotel had informed them of this numerous times. The mention of a spa was in fact free access to the hotel spa facilities - swimming pool - and not a jacuzzi bath as the blurb suggested. To compound things it later became evident that the location of the bath against the window prevented a curtain being hung there. Therefore if you needed to have a shower after dark you had to do so with the light off for fear of people outside seeing you in the bath room. There are rooms available with jacuzzi baths but only those costing a great deal more per night. The rest of the room was clean but otherwise like many business hotels. there is a mini bar, barely effective A/C unit and a safe but no iron or trouser press and no coffee making facilities. Our room,211, overlooked the terrace used by restaurant guests and so included their chatter and noise. The large swimming pool to the rear of the hotel was down eleven flights of precariously steep stairs. On the first night we went into Rome on the train returning around 8.30pm to take dinner in the restaurant. we were advised that we should have booked in advance, despite being a guest there and there being no other places to eat within three miles! When we were eventually seated it was in amongst a large Italian family gathering celebrating a 25th wedding anniversary. The starter of Gnocchi was plentiful but of one flavour throughout the dish. My wifes seafood ravioli starter was again plentiful and she was impressed by the many tastes it gave her. For our mains we both had veal dishes with roasted eggplant and mozzarella. Thats exactly what we got. A fatty piece of meat, two pieces of roasted aubergine topped with grated mozzarella and a piece of stuffing. the portion size was small and swimming in grease. We asked for a bottle of house red to go with it and were served a bottle of chianti called \"Oddone\". Breakfast the following morning was little better. Scrambled eggs and bacon were the only hot options. the rest being apple croissants - no plain ones or pan chocolate, There was choice of cold meats that you had to slice yourselves along with cheese in a similar manner. This was all taken whilst lift music was played into the room. The second night we took dinner in Rome but returned to find another wedding reception on and the only parking place available at the bottom of the very steep hill to the rear of the hotel. Nine flights of steep steps back to our room were not what we wanted after a long day on the tourist trail. Day three was much the same but this time it was scrambled eggs and sausage. On the evening another wedding that went on until 1am with noisey vocal guests and fireworks outside our window. On the face of it this impressve looking four star establishment is ideal for those that want silver service meals by waiters in white tunics or if you want a fairytale wedding location. If like me you want four star accomodation for a base from which to explore Rome then look elsewhere.

The view of the landscaping was gorgious! 100% romantic. It was very nice to leave the busy streets of Rome into a beautiful, quite, romantic setting! Overall, we did know about the food and transportation problem and we did mentally prepare for it. What we did just planned our day occordingly and mastered the train system. Train system is very easy and the front desk did do a good job at explaining it. This place is not for family or friends vacation. Strickly for honeymoon or a quick getaway to unwind because there is nothing to do in that area and your far from Rome. They do have info on horse back riding and golfing but thats either a little out of the way or the horse back riding that talk about in the website is not offered by them but by a local farmer. Would we stay here again, yes. Only because if we were looking for a romantic setting, this is perfect. The hotels in Rome are not that pretty and don't offer a swimming pool. With this hotel you have ask yourself what exactly are you looking for. If quite and romantic is what your looking for, this is it. If not, RUN. Your better off staying at a local (nice) hotel in the center of Rome where everything for the most part is walking distance and food is great.

First of all, it's a castle and it is in great shape. We requested rooms with views of the mountains which was beautiful. The food was great but yes a tad expensive. The hotel had so many unique characteristics and was fun to explore. The shuttle says it's at fixed times but we found out you have to let them know when to pick you up at the station or they don't come. You must check the time tables at the stations in the city to see when the trains come because they are not as often as you would like. The whole transportation system in rome is slow in general so plan on a lot of extra travel time. Overall I thought it was worth it and wish i could get married in this magical place.

I have visited Rome many times on business and have usually stayed in a city centre hotel. As this trip was mainly holiday, I deliberately chose the Castello as I wanted a relaxing break away from the noise and crowds in the centre. The idea of a castle also appealed and the hotel website had some very attractive pictures of the place. The drive in our hire car from Fiumicino airport to the hotel should have taken less than 30 minutes, but even though I had programmed the hotel address carefully into the memory, we were still not adequately prepared for he chaotic (i.e. typically Roman) road network approaching the hotel. The first thing to note is that the hotel can only be approached from the North, any maps showing direct vehicle access from the southeast of La Giustiniana village are wrong, you will just end up back on the GRA!!! After two phone calls to the hotel and lots of driving around in the dark, we eventaully found the hotel access road. Driving hints: continue driving northwest of La Giustiniana on Via Cassia for approx 1.5km. DO NOT be tempted to turn off Via Cassia into La Giustiniana centre. If you are sharp-eyed you will then see a small yellow hotel sign indicating a left turn off Via Cassia. So, turn left, go straight ahead at the small roundabout and under the railway bridge. Then turn left at the T-junction and follow what can best be described as a pot-holed farm track (!) for approx 1.5km, turning towards the left at a small restaurant, then climbing slightly uphill. The hotel is at the end of the final 300m straight section. The hour wasted trying to find the hotel in the dark with inadequate directions from the hotel was stressful, completely avoidable if the hotel were to add the above information to their website (and put up a bigger sign), and did not get the trip off to a good start. Check-in was fine, and the Castello does look very impressive floodlit at night. We were allocated a small \"attic\" room with exposed beams. Not a particularly bad room, but were were expecting something with a \"wow\" factor after seeing the pictures on the website. We were also dissatisfied with having a skylight as the only window and a very small bathroom. I raised these issues with the front desk the following morning and we were transferred to a more pleasant room with a great view out of the window and a larger bathroom with bath. We ate two dinners in the hotel, the first was excellent and reasonably priced for the quality of food and the atmospheric dining room. The second meal was definitely inferior - one of our orders came out wrong and my tuna steak was overcooked. Pity, as a hotel in this price bracket with such an atmospheric dining room really needs to deliver the highest food standards. Our other dinner was taken at the Antica restaurant round the corner from the railway station in La Giustiniana, a typical local restaurant with pleasant Italian staples and cosy atmosphere. I was glad to have the car though as it was raining. Some other reviewers have mentiomed walking from the hotel to La Giustiniana but I would not advise this at all unless you are a fit, determined walker and have plenty of time on your hands. A hire car is virtually essential for the Castello. I also noticed that there was no taxi rank visible in the villagem and it would be unwise to rely on the hotel shuttle which is very infrequent and can be late if the rush hour traffic is bad (happened to us the one time we used this service). On balance we enjoyed our short stay at this hotel, but I would rate it more highly had it not been for the accessibility problems oin the first night and the patchy service in the restaurant. Both these issues could easily be tackled by the hotel management if they chose to do so. So, recommended but watch out for the issues mentioned.", "Date": "May 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK traveller", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful but lacking elsewhere\u201d", "Author": "UKtraveller34", "ReviewID": "UR16308545", "Content": "After seeing the website and reading other traveller reviews my expectations were high for this hotel, and although aesthetically it was as beautiful as advertised, I encountered several small disappointments which lowered my overall opinion of the hotel.

We enquired prior to arriving in Rome about transport to and from the Hotel and had been informed that a taxi fare from the main railway station in Rome to the Castello would be approx 20 Euros it actually came to 49 Euros which would reduce depending upon the day, time of travel, number of passengers and baggage.

Also because the castello had been booked for a wedding party the main restaurant was not available and that dinner would be served in another part of the castle, in a deserted function hall where we had to then go in search of a member of staff.
