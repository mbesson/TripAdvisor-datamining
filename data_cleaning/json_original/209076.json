But that's what I'm going to lead off with because of the curmudgeonly \"waitresses\" at breakfast. Sure, it's a complimentary breakfast. But can you say grumpy? Irritable? Temperamental? Maniacal? That describes the waitresses serving this complimentary breakfast. I went with a few friends recently, and it's \"seat-yourself\" as you walk in. On one morning, after my friend sat at a nearby table, the curmudgeonly waitress told her, \"No, you'll sit here.\" That is a direct quote. On another morning, who knows, maybe she was overwhelmed by the fact that there were a total of FOUR tables seated, but when another friend of mine was eating his omelette, because the other people at his table were done eating, the waitress went to take his plate. He asked the waitress if she could leave his plate, as he wasn't yet finished, and she simply stated, \"No.\" Maybe they were understaffed the entire week we were there, or maybe they're not paid enough. But I had never seen such a display of outright hostility. The guest rooms are fine, the front desk staff are very nice, and the location is good, but unless you want to be treated with absolute contempt just for eating breakfast, if you stay at the Buswells, do NOT eat at this restaurant.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "Debra007", "ReviewID": "UR127195915", "Content": "Spent four nights in March at Buswell's and we were very happy with the location and the hotel.

The remains of the pork joint was small and the beef large, it looked burnt, and perhaps was not appealing to the diners.

A friend at work recommended the best location to stay in Dublin. Then I did a search on Trip Advisor limiting the amount I would spend for a hotel for one night for 2 people with breakfast to under 200 USD. This was one, of not too many hotels, that came up for that price. So I booked and I was not the least disappointed. It is great value for the money and probably the most luxurious place I stayed on my 3 week vacation. Now the place is old, but the reception and dining room are grand, just grand. And I am one that appreciates old luxury (coming from the states, you just don't get as much 'old luxury'). I especially like that besides the buffet, you could order a limited variety of things off the menu and I had the salmon and eggs. Probably the best part is that the location really was ideal, bordered by Grafton Street to the West, Trinity College to the north, St. Stephen's Green to the south, and a number of museums to the east. All of these within easy walking distance - 5 minutes. The only criticism I have, and it would be so easy to fix, is there was a letter missing from the hotel sign and some of the light bulbs were burned out of the fixtures. Those things reminded me of the age and that it seemed a little worn. The receptionist was just great. It seemed as if she remembered every person. She knew our room number.

My girlfriend decided to come along just to see Dublin. She is VERY choosy over hotels - I would have gone in a \u20ac30 b&b, so I needed to book something special. Buswells fitted the bill. The location is second to none, with everything easily walkable. 5 minutes to Trinity College (sight seeing), 5 mins to Grafton Street (shopping), 10 mins to Temple Bar (entertainment), 10 mins to O'Connell Street (shopping), 20 minutes to Aviva Stadium . And over the road is the Houses of the Oireachtas (Irish parliament) - with the UK Queen visiting this provided plenty of entertainment & sights! Even if you don't want to go far, the immediate vicinity (St Stephens Green, Merrion Row, Dawson Street) have shops, restaurants & bars to suit all pockets. This is a classy part of town. Getting to the hotel from the airport is easy. The Aircoach (blue bus) was \u20ac7 one way or \u20ac12 return, & stopped off on nearby Merrion Square North, picking up on the even closer Dawson street, both only a few minutes walk away. I was told a taxi would be \u20ac25 one way. The hotel is open 24/7. The front desk staff were efficient, informative & polite. The lobby area is classically elegant, with plenty of space. we were able to leave our luggage behind the front desk on check-out. The rooms were elegant. It was clear that the place had been refurbished recently. Everything was spotless (a major point for my girlfriend). Beds were comfy - not too soft, not too hard - with just the right thickness of duvet for the room temperature. Bathroom very good with an excellent, powerful shower. Plenty of storage space - I always unpack my luggage. Only fault was the TV reception was a little fuzzy on one or two channels (most of the channels are UK ones). Our room was internal to the building, so there was no view, although the room was still bright & airy. Breakfast was excellent, & very filling. We had the Irish breakfast every day. The serve until 10:30am which is good for us later risers. It was also included in the price which seemed rare for Dublin. We used the bar a few times. Prices were equal to anywhere else in the city centre, with a reasonable selection of beers. Excellent Guiness. Many of the clientelle appeared to be from the nearby parliament.

Room was more spacious than your usual with a comfy bed, very pleased with the room/bathroom overall. Free wifi in the room, just remember to renew your password at the front desk every 24 hours. Very central and convenient location. Airport shuttle drops you off steps from the hotel. Pick up location for shuttle back to the airport is about a 3 blocks walk.

Being located right near the government building, politicians tend to frequent, so don't be surprised to see an important figure or two. Really my only complaint was with the homeless man who was in his sleeping bag at night across the road from the front entrance. He woke me up more than once, screaming and talking to himself as early as 5am. More than once he also cursed at me for no reason, only because I was standing in front of the hotel. I was told by hotel staff that they could do nothing, as the owners of the building across the street allowed him to sleep there. Bringing it to their attention, it seemed obvious they were well aware of the situation. It was a shame he was disturbing the peace of this hotel every night I was there. So if you book, as for a room facing the side street, unless you are a heavy sleeper, and prefer not to have fresh air with your windows shut. I would have given this hotel a 5 stars, as on the inside it overall exceeded my expectations for the price, however, the man across the street caused such a disturbance it was difficult to get your full mornings rest, even in their comfy beds.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dublin", "Title": "\u201cgood location but very small rooms\u201d", "Author": "a visitor from ireland", "ReviewID": "UR77945364", "Content": "The location is excellent, right in the city centre and a reasonably quiet area.

A charming 67-bedroom Georgian hotel, it is ideally located in the centre of Dublin city a short stroll from St. Stephen\u2019s Green, Trinity College, Grafton Street and many other visitor attractions and near to the DART at Westland Row and the LUAS (Tram) terminal at St. Stephen\u2019s Green. Strangely, whilst I have long recommended it to friends and whilst the present wife and her sister have stayed there this was my first time there as a resident. That is not to say that the place is unknown to me. The bar had Adam style plaster swags painted blue and white and used to be known as the \u201cWedgwood Bar.\u201d Many years ago in the company of a leading Irish feminist I had bumped into the Northern Ireland poet Michael Longley and his poetess wife Edna who were staying in the hotel. Michael had just won the GPA poetry prize and with the winners cheque in his pocket was in expansive and generous form, from what I could vaguely recall the next day! The bar and restaurant are today called Truman\u2019s after an adjoining print and drawing instrument shop which I was a customer of as a young architectural student. When it closed down in 1975 Buswell\u2019s bought the property and incorporated it into the hotel and as Secretary of the Student Union at Bolton Street I bought most of their stock for our Student Shop. Being across from the Irish Parliament it had an erstwhile reputation as a late night drinking den for politicos leading to the story about a conversation between a policeman who raided the premises at 3 in the morning and encountered the then Minister for Justice (and later Prime Minister) Charles J Haughey \u201cWhat will it be for you Guard, a pint of Guinness or a transfer to Donegal?\u201d This is a good hotel in a great location, very close to Grafton Street, Trinity College and the National Museums. Our room was spacious with high ceilings and throughout the d\u00e9cor and furnishings were of a good quality and fresh. The Bathroom and shower were excellent if compact. The bar was good with helpful and obliging service but here and in the lounge you could just sit and relax with no pressure to order anything. We only had breakfast on the last morning (when my parents stayed and this is taken in the rather splendidly upholstered Truman\u2019s Restaurant. It was as good as I\u2019ve seen anywhere with a really excellent selection of juices, cereals, breads (including Irish soda bread) meats and cheeses from a buffet counter with the hot Irish Breakfast, toast and generous pots of tea and coffee served at the linen covered table. Last year when my wife and sister in law wanted to stay Buswell\u2019s quoted 245 euros a night. Well this is far too much (you could stay in the Shelbourne for this) but what a difference a year makes as I got the rooms on their site on the internet for 89 to 99 euros a night. Don\u2019t pay extra when booking for breakfast because they price this separately at 20 euros a night (A Mercure Hotel in Paris charges 15 euros!) but we were offered \u201cany breakfast\u201d at the desk at a more reasonable 10 euros. The hotel needs to get its pricing realistic and consistent. The other thing to remember is that as this hotel incorporates four different Georgian buildings so room sizes vary and the dovetailing of bathrooms into the structure doesn\u2019t always make for good sound insulation. Also, being in the centre street noise is unavoidable but we found by closing the windows, including the secondary glazing, the room was quiet. Also as these are Georgian buildings don\u2019t expect aircon, but really you don\u2019t need this in Dublin. This is a well managed property with well trained and friendly staff who really make a difference and I would single out Mary on reception and Clive the Concierge but most of the staff have been here a while and this continuity makes a difference. If you want a personal hotel with a country house athmosphere in a great location Buswell\u2019s is a good deal. Or as the elder Mr C put it as he was reading the complimentary newspaper in his adopted armchair in the relaxing lounge \u201cI could get used to this.\u201d", "Date": "July 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "sheffield", "Title": "\u201cCosy homely hotel\u201d", "Author": "Dukeno1", "ReviewID": "UR32559576", "Content": "A little off the beaten track but still within walking distance to temple bar and O'Connell street.

On arrival we were shown right to the top of the hotel into the tiniest darkest bedroom with one small window and it stank of cigarettes. Yuk! Apparently I had not requested a no smoking bedroom - I was not asked when I initially booked over the phone and there was nothing on the web to indicate I had a preference! Anyway, they said they were full and they would probably not be able to do anything about it, however, when we mentioned we might have to go and find another hotel, they quickly found us a no smoking room with a nice large window overlooking the front. It was still TINY (hardly anywhere to put all our hard-earned shopping!) and very noisy from early in the morning. I have to say the staff were nice and the breakfast ok. Would probably stay again if we could be guaranteed a bigger room!", "Date": "October 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albuquerque, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "anonymous_from_PA", "ReviewID": "UR5936150", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here in early October for three days.

We had room 114 at the top of the stairs on the first floor. The lay-out of the room was very awkward. The size was not really that bad but the furniture layout made it hard to move around the room. The heater was also broken in the room so the mornings were a little chilly. The hotel did provide a space heater. There was also some type of noise in the room which became more of a \u201cwhite-noise\u201d by the time we left, but it was nuisance.

Lovely room with huge bed, period furniture and fireplace, impressive public rooms including a large bar area serving a wide range of very good food and an elegant restaurant where breakfast is cooked to order - a rare thing nowadays. All the staff are truly friendly with no hint of the stuffiness one might expect at such a refined hotel. If there is one criticism it is that the room (100) was not air conditioned and the weather was very hot, so it was necessary to open the windows, which allowed in a fair bit of traffic noise - but that's a minor quibble.

Had a 2 night stay at Buswells at the beginning of our trip. We took the Air Coach from the airport to the hotel, (drops you within feet of the hotel) arriving at Buswells around 6:30 a.m. (front doors were still locked) and got let in by the night desk clerk. Originally we had planned on dropping off our luggage and wandering round Dublin for a bit until we could check in. The clerk checked on room openings and told us they did have an open triple room we could check into right then. There might be the possibility of having to move us later in the day but he didn't think so. We were very grateful for being allowed to check in so early as our 11 yr. old son had developed a cold on the trip over and was feeling pretty darn miserable. Our room (302) was on the small size but we weren't bothered by it because we figured it was fair exchange for letting us check in so early. From the little card that had our original booked room number on it, I saw we'd originally been booked for Rm 214. I have no idea if that is a more spacious room. Being able to let my son curl up under some warm covers and get some sleep was more important to me! Desk staff was very friendly. One of the evenings I walked into the crowded bar (business conference?----all in dark suits) and asked the waitress if I could get a bottle of wine opened. She directed me to the restaurant and told me Daniel would be more than happy to do that for me. He did indeed and also gave me 2 wine glasses to take with me, without my asking. Our room was clean, fairly quiet for being right in the city and the bathroom was just fine. Apparently the rate was pretty good too as I told our friend over there what we paid and he said it was pretty good for Dublin esp. given the location. He grew up in Dublin but had never been in Buswells and was quite impressed with the lobby when he came to collect us to take us down to Wexford.

The lounge areas have lovely large leather chairs and comfy settees - a very relaxing atmosphere to sit with a morning paper, afternoon tea or a drink before bed.
