If you are driving or will have a rental car, Hotel Circle is an ideal location right off I-8. The room was nicely decorated and extremely quiet. Since the room had a refrigerator, I called the front desk and asked if it was possible to get a microwave also, one was delivered within 5 minutes. The bathroom was large with lots of counter space. The room also had lots of lights and modern furniture. The Bistro was well stocked with a great menu selection and the food and service was always outstanding. The sit-down tables had individual televisions which was a nice touch. There were also taller tables with bar stool style seats. The Lounge area was modern and very comfortable. The business center was located in the same area. The front desk personnel were very professional and extremely helpful with any questions that I had. Housekeeping was also exceptional, when I got back everyday the room had been cleaned and looking like new. If you are going to visit San Diego and want to be located near the highway, I highly recommend Courtyard at Hotel Circle.

After some discussion with the front desk staff...we got that straightened out to my satisfaction. Hotel was easy to find near Highway 163 and within minutes of the Zoo, the Gaslamp district or the airport. However...parking at the hotel is $16/day with unlimited in/out. Yikes. Lobby is well sized with places for relaxing. They could have more power outlets at some of the couches, and some remotes for the TV's. Elite Rewards members are given a coupon for ONE FREE DRAFT BEER or a discount on other wine/beer purchases. They would not budge on this after several repeated attempts at flirting with the front desk staff. Rooms were nice and had actual queen beds in their double rooms. Thank goodness for that! Oh, the water in the shower/sink has varying degrees of hotness, from warm to hot and skin-melting lava. Refreshing, yes...but be advised. Breakfast was standard issue Courtyard fare at inflated Courtyard prices with free coffee for you people around the corner across from the conference room with glass doors so everyone can watch you have a board meeting for some reason. Wi-fi was fast and easy to log on. I'd stay here again, but watch the rates and don't forget to add in the parking fee. I wouldn't pay more than maybe $119-129 for a room here plus parking. They tried to charge me $159 and I got snippy. I mean, why spend that much for a Courtyard room with no Elite benefits when for $50 more I could go to the real Marriott downtown and get treated like a king?

I have to say, we took full advantage of most of the ammenities offered here and were greatly pleased. We checked in on a Thursday and had very friendly service from the front desk staff. Our room was clean, nicely decorated and the two queen sized beds were very comfortable for everyone in our party. We ate breakfast each day at the bistro and it was wonderful- very tasty and, again, great service. The front desk staff was very knowledgeable about area attractions and helpful with suggestions for restaurants and directions. They even provided us with a sheet of paper that listed directions, addresses and phone numbers for area points of interest. Housekeeping was great- the room was always clean when we came back from our daily adventures and any requests (extra towels) were filled promptly and with a smile. My daughter and aunt used the pool and loved it- the pool area is very nice, clean and relaxing. I utilized the on site laundry facility and found it to also be clean and reasonably priced. We found the location of Hotel Circle to be extremely easy access- you just hop on and hop off the highway to get anywhere- we found very easy and quick access to everything we were looking for- Sea World, the SD Zoo, Gas lamp District, Old Town, Mission Beach and Sea Port Village. Every place that we wanted to visit was quickly accessible and within a 10-15 minute drive from this centrally located hotel. The parking fee of $16 is clearly spelled out on the hotel's website, so I don't really understand why it is an issue for other patrons... we went to the hotel knowing full well what to expect. The parking lot was safe, clean and provided easy access to the rooms with keyed access.

We were getting our daughter off to college so it was close to campus and the malls (Target, Bed Bath & Beyond, etc.) which made it ideal for us. I do not particularly \"like\" Mission Valley - and for the quality of the hotel I think it is overpriced. But I assume that they cater to business travelers. I was able to find better rates at 4 star hotels downtown - so if convenience were not the issue I would stay downtown, handsdown. The room was clean although the halls and bathrooms were starting to show wear. They skimp a bit on towels - so ask for extra. The laundry facility was helpful and the gym was decent for a quick workout. Did not hit the bistro or the bar - but it seemed busy. I prefered to get REAL coffee in Hillcrest just around the corner. We tried to use the business center to print something - but it was very busy with all computers in use. The free internet in the room was good as many hotels in MV charge for it (which seems excessive for the type of hotels available). The parking was $16 dollars a day. I do not get it - I realize downtown there is a lack of parking and most hotels need to incorporate valet parking - but this was just a regular parking lot so I do not get point except that it is a money grab. But every hotel I looked at in MV and Hotel Circle charged so that must be the standard. My preference would be to just include it in the room price.

It wasn't convenient for me with respect to where I was working, but for most people the location would be good. The lobby and rooms have been renovated so it's nice. Bed is good. Bathroom is nice. Tv is flatscreen but on some channels the reception is spotty. Parking is for a fee which I disagree with but we will let that factor slide. They have a cool lobby set up with the bistro and bar which has drinks and good food but they don't have room service. My real issue with the hotel is the air conditioning and the service. I am one of those people who needs their room cold- like arctic cold. And I also am one of those people who believe that if I'm paying for the room then I ought to be allowed to make it as hot or as cold as I like. Well, as soon as I got in, I cranked the digital wall control down to 60. I woke up at 2am thinking it was warm and looked at the wall control only to then notice the fine print sticker on it which says that the AC will not go lower than 68 and if you need help contact maintenance. Alright, so the next morning on the way out I called the front desk and asked for maintenance to come fix whatever limits they had set on the control so I would get cooler. I came back from work 12 hours later and no one had come up. The room was 68 although the thermostat was set to 60 all day. I called maintenance again. 20 minutes later the maintenance guy shows up. I ask him to please make it colder. He looks baffled and essentially fiddles with the wall unit and the actual AC by the window and then unplugs the AC then plugs it back it. He then proceeds to tell me he reset it so it will be better. I tell him the system is clearly set with a limit on how cold it allows you to make it and that there must be a button sequence or something to lower it. I know this is true but I also know it because otherwise there wouldn't be a notice on the wall saying call maintenance if you need it colder than 68. He doesn't know how to do that and insists he fixed it. I let him leave and sure enough 10 minutes later the air turns off again. Room temp is of course 68. What do I do? I proceed to take the condenser by the window apart and google the manual for it and then change the dipswitches on it so it now works as a standalone unit (sans wall controller). I turn the AC itself down to 60. And what do you know? It gets down to 60. I am writing this from my room right now which is wonderfully cold, no thanks to maintenance. All too many hotels these days are doing this- limiting your ability to control your own environment because they want to try and cut costs. Well eff em. I want it cold. And if you do too, almost every AC that is \"limited\" has a way to \"unlimit\" it. Most models are online if you google it. If you need help, message me. So yeah.

In the past decade of attending a particular professional conference, something weird happens the vast majority of the time. Sometimes, it's dangerous and unacceptable; other times (like last year, getting a room shaped like an arrowhead), it's just weird. I'm so happy to say my experience at the Courtyard Marriott on San Diego's Hotel Circle was a complete delight and offered no surprises. Check-in went smoothly, taking no more than five minutes. Our room was clean (and my companion and I are both VERY picky about such things), the towels were plentiful, and housekeeping left the room tidy and organized before our return each day. The fridge housing could have been dusted a little better, but the bathroom and bedroom were spotless. The bed was firm, but so comfortable I had the five best night's sleep of the entire year, and the comforter was just the right weight. The air conditioning/heating control let us make the room the perfect temperature without excessive noise. This is the second time in six months I've stayed in a Courtyard, and I like the little touches like the mini-mantels with the black and white paintings, the excellent flat-screen TV with high-quality cable and spiffy, fashionable bathrooms, comfortable desk chair and numerous electronic input panels, easily accessible on the visible wall behind the desk. Two outlets at bedside, right under the bedside lights, enable charging of digital devices. This is a perfect room for the modern traveler. We loved that the free WiFi was blazingly fast; at our conference hotel (a five minute walk away), my colleagues were complaining that the paid-for Wi-Fi was unpredictable and slow, but because I'd read Trip Advisor, I knew to stay away from that venue for sleeping. If you're staying at an (ahem) conference center on Hotel Circle, stay here and walk the five minutes. The staff was friendly, and helpful, though a little unimaginative. The snack bar is right next to the bar; when the snack bar was closed at 11:05p and I wanted a juice, the young men behind the counter shrugged apologetically. I suggested they hand the juice bottle to the bartender and let her ring it up. After much discussion among themselves, they did that, but then the bartender gave me the wrong change without comment. When I pointed out the error, she noted that the bar only had quarters because of the bar's pricing methods. I had her give me back one of the quarters I gave her so that I could provide exact change. (It wasn't the money, but the principle of thinking someone wouldn't expect to get their change back.) All other experiences with the staff were exemplary. They called taxis for us which arrived (with the exception of our middle-of-the-night airport request) within five minutes. My requests for extra hangers and foam pillows were acted upon within minutes. The lobby was refreshingly modern and clean, good for hanging out and people watching, and though the computers and boarding pass kiosks were not enclosed, there wasn't much in the way of noise or distraction.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Washington, USA", "Title": "\u201cVery nice one night pre-cruise stay\u201d", "Author": "justtravel", "ReviewID": "UR104085938", "Content": "I got this hotel thru priceline as a one night stay before our cruise. We arrived at 1:15pm Thursday March 31 and Veni H. was the one that checked us in. We were allowed to get to our room at that time, which was nice since we just drove from Orange County Airport after flying in from Portland and being up since 4am. I put down a $250 cash deposit which was returned the next morning, minus the $16 parking fee, so you do not need a credit card like a previous poster said. The room we were assigned was number 744, on the 7th floor overlooking the pool. The room had two beds and was nicely furnished. Everything, including the bathroom was very clean and working properly. The kids and I swam in the heated pool and really enjoyed the warm San Diego sun. The lobby was very nice and offered three computers with free internet and big screen televisions. The hotel was close to the Mission Valley Mall where we had lunch and close to the freeway for easy access. The only improvements I would suggest are that the faucet in the bathroom needs to be longer to make washing the hands easier and there needs to be four bath towels and not just three. It makes no sense to have a room for four with only three bath towels. Veni H. checked us out on Friday and she did a very good job and was very friendly and even knew my name. Overall, this was a great way to start our cruise vacation and I look forward to stay at this hotel again.

Next, I did not know that I needed to have at least the minimum amount of how much my total stay cost would be on my debit/credit card. I took everything out of my bank account so I could specifically use all cash. Due to that she informed me that my credit card is not valid. I told her that I only had $.40 in my account, but wanted to pay everything in cash. She spoke to me so fast that I can't even remember what she told me, but said it was fine and gave me my room keys. The next day I get a call from the front desk telling me my card is invalid and they need to have a valid credit card on file. This time I dealt with two unfriendly front desk girls that treated me like I should have known their credit card policy and how all hotels have the same policy. This was never informed to me when I booked the room at all, would have been a nice detail to know. The room was nice looking, but there were little things that showed that there was not enough attention to detail. Such as the nice looking chair had one arm rest cover missing and the arm rest had the zipper broken was half zipped down. The compartment that housed the refrigerator had some nasty white grease all over the bottom of the flooring. Personally the bed was uncomfortable because the mattress was posterpedic. Also the room only came with one packet of caffeinated coffee when it was obvious that there was gonna be at least two people staying in the room being that there were two queen beds. Hello!

I informed the front desk thaty maybe someone needed to check the water and they said they would do so. Upon checkout, after having washed my suit twice and the smell was still there (and of course the color was ruined), I asked if it were possible to refund my money for the suit since I had just purchased it ( I presented the receipt and everything). The front desk clerk took the suit and receipt to the back to a manager, I guess and they refused to refund because the suit's label said \"do not bleach\". Well, I told her I didn't bleach it, I went swimming in THEIR hot tub which is what swimsuits are made for. She couldn't help me though and it really put a damper on our trip! Well, I finally contacted corporate when we got back to Texas and dealt with a very nice man from the executive offices who refunded the price of my suit and offered us 2 nights free stay!

Our room was beautiful, with a lovely view, and everything was brand spanking new. It really was a treat and our kids loved it. One night when we were watching a movie after a long day at Sea World our room suddenly smelled of cigarette smoke. We sniffed around our room and looked in the hallway outside our room and couldn't determine where the smell was coming from. A couple hours later our room smelled very strongly of cigarette smoke again. Once again we tried following our noses to figure out from whence the odor was emanating and couldn't find a thing. The next morning as we were preparing for the day our room reeked of the smoke. We went out into the hallway and saw someone exiting the stairwell which was just a few feet away and the scent of smoke followed him as he walked past. The next time we smelled the smoke in our room we quickly looked at the door to the stairs and saw the culprit smoking in the stairwell. At this point we called the front desk to complain that someone was smoking in the stairwell in this supposedly \"smoke-free\" establishment and each time he lit up the smoke was coming in through the vents in our room. We asked if something could be done to dissuade said smoker from infecting our lungs and we were told that while they do have a no smoking policy, it was not something they could/would enforce and, basically, it was too bad for us. We complained a couple more times when our friend lit up, but were always told the same thing--they just didn't have power to enforce their own rules. Seriously people. So while the hotel itself was beautiful and new and clean, it really was pathetic that the reason we stay at Marriott hotels (their non-smoking policy) was a complete farce and apparently something they couldn't actually enforce.", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bakersfield, Ca", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in San Diego\u201d", "Author": "mrktngspclst", "ReviewID": "UR60604293", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Courtyard Marriott along with my husband for our vacation.

This lot is not secured, (although they claim it is) and there are NO places to park your car in the shade during the vast majority of the day. So, most of the time you come out to a car that has been in direct sun and is 110 degrees inside. Why am I paying 14.00 a day for that???

The decor and furniture were nice, but customer service and room cleanliness were lacking. The top of the headboard was extremely dusty, the carpet had sticky blackened stains at the foot of the bed, and the counter and cabinet/closet door were not wiped (we saw oily fingerprints). At check-in, the middle-aged Asian lady was quiet, made no eye contact, and did not smile. We said thank you at the end and she didn't even say you're welcome. The hotel was nice, but being a new property, they need to pay more attention to detail. Instead of just relying on the nice furniture, nice bedding, they need to focus on genuine customer service being that it is the HOSPITALITY business, especially in times like this with tons of competition. Also, this is the first Courtyard we've stayed at that we've had to pay for parking; it was $14 a day.", "Date": "April 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boynton Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cExtremely Clean, Incredibly Nice Staff, and Affordable Bistro\u201d", "Author": "Trip4AWeekend", "ReviewID": "UR26090538", "Content": "I stayed here for a week for a girl's trip with my mom.

Nice restaurants and high end shopping within walking distance. If you're going to stay in this area, there is no other option.

They did a nice job with the redesign as this Courtyard has their new design concept so lobby and room feel more like full service hotel vs. a motel style. Lobby is open and spacious with high tech tools to get news and local events on touch screen monitors. Several TVs set up to watch while you dine and nice wide open business center. Rooms are nice, flat panel TVs, spacious living area, nice work space (free wireless internet) and ample bathroom. Nice hotel for a short stay in San Diego at a resaonable cost vs a full service hotel. As most hotels on Hotel Circle are dated, this is a good option since it is brand new (except the elevators, old and slow, slow, slow). TIPS: ask for a room facing the back of the hotel, the front facing rooms face the freeway and are too noisy. If in the back be on the fourth floor and above as the A/C units on the 2nd floor roof are loud. Be in main tower as the side tower is in a cell phone 'dead zone'. Why do I know all this? I had to switch my room several times to get a room that was quiet and that my cell phone got reception.
