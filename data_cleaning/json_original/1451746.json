We did get one, but we were told only to have one electrical appliance in use at a time which we found laughable, the staff weren't particularly helpful or interested in us and didn't appear to know the local area (we asked for some advice on tourist attractions but other than give me a leaflet and a map, the staff were no help). I was completely unimpressed with this place - it was right on the beach, but even the beach wasn't that nice - there are much nicer beaches in San Diego. All in all, I loved San Diego. We were only there for a few nights but had a fab time despite our nasty sleeping conditions. My recommendation would be stay elsewhere folks.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dallas", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "dianedallas", "ReviewID": "UR125242819", "Content": "We stayed here February 2012. This motel is nothing fancy but the location is perfect, right on the beach. Our room had a partial view of the ocean. The view of the ocean from the balcony outside our door was amazing! The room was clean, very basic, with a small refrigerator, microwave and coffeemaker. They gave us extra coffee, towels, etc. when we requested them. The bed was comfortable. The motel is within walking distance of many restaurants, many of them right on the beach. There is a coffee bar about a block away at Crystal Pier. However, parking is definately a problem. There are not enough parking spaces and the parking on the street fills up fast, especially on the weekend. We would definately stay here again. It is probably the most affordable place to stay on the beach.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOnce was more than enough!\u201d", "Author": "Gl0betr0tterAnnie", "ReviewID": "UR120086403", "Content": "Stayed here for 2 nights on a girl's USA roadtrip and can honestly say this is one of the worst places I have ever stayed. We stayed in a one bedroom 'suite' which was on the ground floor right next to the reception. The room was pretty large to be fair however it was in a word FILTHY! The whole place smelled mouldy and the dust was about an inch thick on the window blinds. The wardrobes in the bedroom were also very smelly and mouldy needless to say we never bothered to unpack. The outdoor area was rather untidy and the tables and chairs were old and dirty. We asked reception to borrow an iron and the one they gave us was covered in burnt in black stuff so we ended up chosing to wear our clothed creased rather than use it. When we returned the iron the lady had the cheek to look at the burnt stuff then at us in disgust!!!! The only thing going for this place is the location which is right on the beach but when you see the other hotels and guesthouses surrounding the Pacific View Motel then it just magnifies exactly how bad this place is.

There was also no iron or ironing board, hair dryer or safe. We also had an odd incident when one of the staff just let themselves in our room while we were in there and made up some strange story about checking the carpet!! But, it is the cheapest hotel in this location and there is parking... well for another $20 per night!

However, people should know what they are getting into. They are self described as a vintage establishment. What this means is that everything about your room will be antiquated and slightly run down. You don't realize how great cable TV and a phone in your room is until you stay somewhere like this. We had three channels, which was fine but for the price we should have had cable. The location is a blessing and a curse. It is walking distance to countless bars and resturaunts and stumbling distance to the beach. This unfortunately makes for a very noisy night with paper thin walls and windows open (no ac at least when I was there). I had four nights booked and they made me pay in advance with a zero refund policy so I kind of had the feeling they knew they were putting one over on me. Lots of wierd policys. There were also people living in the motel. If there had been good weather on the beach it would have been perfect. However, I unwisely came during June Gloom so the crumby motel was not worth it in my case.

The front desk was very busy, but the girl working was very polite and helpful. She even printed us out directions from the hotel to our various destinations in San Diego. Also, she recommended several places to eat, shop (all within walking distance). The service was very good for such a small, mom'n'pop type motel. The room was OK. There was nothing particularly special about it. Be forewarned there is no air conditioning, no pool, no cable (they're still using rabbit ears!), and if the parking is sold out for the day, you have to hunt for a space. A nice touch was that the room did have a mini fridge and a booklet, explaining what the rules were/numbers for security maintenance, etc, and place to eat/things to do. We stayed for 3 days and the housekeeping staff was also very nice, they cleaned our room everyday and made our bed with fresh sheets each day. The location was the absolute best! It was on the boardwalk, between Tower 23 and Pacific Terrace. Our room had a gorgeous view of Crystal Pier/The Pacific Ocean. We parked our car the first day and only used it when we went to Sea World. We walked to the beach, shopping, and dining.
