We (family of five) were passing through Frankfurt last year and stayed for one night at this hotel. Overall, it's a good one. Details:1. Rooms are big (unusual in most other areas in Europe) and clean. Quiet rooms, helpful staff.2. The hotel does have internet acssess; I believe the report of the traveller from USA is about the wrong hotel (He mentions London, not Frankfurt). In fact, since I wanted to use my own laptop, they agreed that I unplug the connections on their computer and plug the internet to my laptop! (no wireless last year, they may have it this year!). 2. Corridors VERY narrow! 3. Funny thing about their elevator: it's not on the main floor! You may not believe this but I honestly tell you you have to carry your luggage a few good steps up on a staircase before you reach the elevator to go up!! Very inconvenient especially for a family of five with small children.4. Oh, another big plus about this hotel is that they have their own free parking (we had rented a car).Overall: recommend!", "Date": "Jul 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR133563537", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Rokh"}, {"Content": "Extremly clean, nice hotel I have stayed in the premier hotel on 3 occasions over the last few years. Everytime i stayed there i found the rooms to be exceptionally clean.The rooms are of a basic nature, but all rooms a fully equiped with all the essentials for a few nighs stay, tv,air con,radio,safe,hair dryer, soap, towels etc.The hotel is located in a quit side street just around the corner from both the main train station and shopping district.I have come and gone from the hotel at all times of the day and night and have not once felt uncomfortable about the area. I felt safe at all times even when travelling alone.I found the buffet breakfast very good indeed.I would stay in the hotel again.", "Date": "Mar 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR479713705", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "No Internet Access The Premier Hotel in London claims to provide Internet Access, but they did not.

The hotel is located about a ten minute walk from the main railway station in a quiet part of town. At first glance, the area may seem a bit sketchy, but I walked to and from the hotel to the railway station during the early morning and late evening hours without problem.The outside of the hotel is not all that impressive, nor is the lobby and the common areas of the hotel or the hallways where the rooms are located. The front office staff were cordial but not all that friendly or helpful. I reserved a single room and was assigned a room on the fourth floor. The room was of average size but was exceptionally clean and well maintained. The furnishings in the room were nice, the bed very comfortable, and the linens and towels clean. The small bathroom had an equally small shower. The hotel offers a breakfast buffet, but since the breakfast was not included in my room rate I did not sample the buffet. At a room rate of approximately US$80 per night, I would recommend this hotel if all you want is a clean, comfortable place to sleep at an affordable price (for a major city) and don't mind the location.", "Date": "Dec 14, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR465853107", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Very nice! We stayed at the Premier last week and we were very satisfied.

However, it is in an iffy part of town (though near Central Station) and the management was very disorganized and harried. They kept trying to push their sponsor's tours on us upon arrival, even though we were asking for directions to an appointment that we had to run to within the hour.
