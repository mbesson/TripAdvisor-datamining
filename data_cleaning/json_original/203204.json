I had a superior room the was quite big and the bed was quite comfortable, but the problems were the hot temperature (and we're not in summer yet) and the unbelievable empty minibar: just two little complimentary bottles of water for the first day, and then you have to go for yourself ordering something at the bar in the lobby, otherwise the minibar will remain left. When I phoned at the reception for another bottle of water during my second evening there, they told me that the bar at that time was closed so there was nothing to do. Moreover, the breakfast is very poor: just some cereals,croissants, non fresh fruit (just the canned one) and espresso and cappuccino from a do-it-yourself machine. But that's not all folks: at the end of the stay, one my colleague had huge problems with the reception staff because they lost some e-mails from our agency with credit card data and they were pretending us to pay again by ourselves...the worst thing has been the rude and unkind behavior of the receptionist, since he had the fault of this misunderstanding.

The moron read the number out loud, checked the system and pleased in realizing I wasn't a hooker he wished me good night.

Well we have - in 2009 and again last week. The good bits remain the same. We think it is in a good location by the Opera House, just off Via Nazionale and round the corner from Piazza Republica. It is well away from the seedier parts of Termini. Whether you consider it far from the main tourist sights depends on how happy you are to walk. Rome is a compact city and we never use any transport other than our own feet to explore it on our stays. One of the joys of Rome is that you can be wandering down a narrow alley and you turn a corner to be confronted by a beautiful church or a delightful little piazza. The Colosseum is about 15 minutes south of the Mondial, the Trevi Fountain about 15 minutes west and the Spanish Steps possibly about 25 minutes North West. I am sure there are hotels nearer these sights, but suspect you would have to pay for the privilege. Breakfast at the Hotel is decent and functional. This has never bothered us as another joy of Rome are all the snacking opportunities from the little street cafes and gelaterias. The hotel room decor has always been a bit spartan. On our most recent visit we were pleasantly surprised to see that the rooms have been renovated and were plusher than before, although I suspect may not match everyone's idea of 4 star quality. Nevertheless the rooms are a good size for a city hotel and very clean. The bathrooms have also been renewed and are a good size and spotlessly clean. I am not sure if all the rooms have been upgraded as yet but this work has made the Mondial even better in my view. I mentioned the Gigolo restaurant down the Via Torino in my last review in 2007 and note I said it was good value at 100 Euros for two. Well, it has now been trumped. Since our last stay a new restaurant has opened, literally next door to the Mondial. This is called \"Cotto\" and it was truly wonderful. I have posted a separate review for the restaurant but a two course meal for two with a good bottle of wine cost us 90 Euros, which was really good value given the quality of the food. The lovely deli and wine bar Enoteca Chirra Goffredo Chirra is the Mondial's other neighbour that is well worth a visit.

The hotel has internet for the usual exorbitant prices. There is a garage next to it that curiously doesn't belong to the hotel. However, it is very convenient, albeit expensive at 25 Euros a night. All in all, the Mondial is not bad if it is attractively priced compared to other hotels in the area, such as the Raffaelo (best choice, but usually more expensive), or Eurostars International Palace (good hotel, but usually overpriced). When I stayed there, the Mondial was 25 Euros cheaper than International Palace and 35 Euros cheaper than the Raffaelo, so selecting the Mondial was a no-brainer. On other occasions, all three hotels were more or less at the same price level, and in that case I'd choose the Raffaelo.", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, Italy", "Title": "\u201cVery satisfied - all nine people\u201d", "Author": "nicex", "ReviewID": "UR97918113", "Content": "We reserved the rooms directly in a hotel.

Our room was nice, but the walls and the ceiling are a bit dirty and old. The doors and the furniture (especially wardrobe) aren't modern - but still very clean. The rooms need to be somehow renovated. However they really were making some renovations in the hotel during our stay, but there were no disturbing and no noise. The bed linen is clean and new. I didn't like the pillow - one was too \"thin\", and the other was too 'thick' - but it depends on the taste ;). The beds were orthopedic and weren't hard at all. It was warm and comfortable in the room. The hotel is situated on the quiet street - so no noise during the night. 6. I've read in one of the reviews at booking.com that the location is not so close to all the tourist's attractions, especially shops - absolutely agree! All the good shops near via del Corso, via Frattina, via Condotti are not less than 25-30 minutes walk by foot. The great advantage of this hotel is metro station Repubblica, so that you can get to the centre of Rome withing 5-10 minutes (for example, to Flaminio, Spagna, Ottaviano (Vatican). Also you can take a bus to get to the centre. The bus stop is 5-10 min walk. 7. We didn't find any good restaurant near the hotel. I guess Termini district is not a place where you can find a good restaurant. But in the centre there're some very good. 8. Termini train station is really 10 minutes walk. 9.

The lobby is fine, a bit OTT and bling but clean and tidy if not a tad dated. The checkin staff were pleasant, no issues there and the staff in general were professional. The room was a disappointment, this is supposedly a four star hotel. The rooms decor was extremely dated and had been touched up badly, to the point where someone had overpainted the bottom of TV in a nice red colour where they had been painting the shelf, which just makes things look a bit shoddy (For staff reference this is room 111 by the way). The room itself was very clean so top marks to the cleaners, but didnt feel like a four star experience, dingy, old decor, not much in the way of nice touches. The bed was hard and one wafer thin pillow each. The breakfast is inlcuded in the price and to be honest I can see why, you would feel cheated if you had to pay for it. 3 hot items, hot dog sausages (??), bacon fat (I challenge anyone to spot meat on them, guess thats why that section never ran out) and burnt scrambled egg, not really what I would call 4 star.

The hotel is located right next to the opera and about a five minute walk from the train station. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and offered a free luggage room to hold luggage after check out which is quite unuaual as most hotels charge. The rooms were basic but cleaned every day with fresh towels etc. There is a TV in the room with only two english speaking channels which was surprising for a four star hotel catering for different nationalites, although we obviously dont spend all our holiday watching TV it is nice to have backround noise while getting ready etc.. There is also no tea or coffee facilites in the room, not being big tea drinkers this wasnt really a problem for us but it may be for big tea and coffee drinkers. The bed was a little hard with only two pillows but after asking for more staff happily obliged. The walls however are very thin and you can almost hear peoples converstaions in the next room! Breakfast was always pleasant with a lot to offer, eggs, bacon, croissants and cereals, more then enough to feel you up till lunch! When you arrive the receptionist will give you two vouchers for two free drinks at the restaurant next door, if you want my advice you wont even bother going. The restaurant looks posh but is completly unimpressive. After unpacking we decided to go and get our free drinks, as soon as we walked in we were shown to a table, we hadnt planned to eat in the first place we saw but being hungry we decided to give it a go. Literally 3 minutes (no exageration) after ordering \"the pasta of the day\" we were given two bowls of luke warm pasta tossed in a bit of pesto. As our first meal in a city like Rome this was extremley disappointing but fortunately we found most roman restaurants arnt like this. Our \"two free drinks\" were two small glasses of a pink sickly fruit concotion, not-as we were led to believe-our own choice in drinks. Ironically this was the most expensive place we went to! When the receptionist gives you these two free tickets at the hotel, your'd be wise just to give the place a miss. The best places to eat are usually the small back street places where locals eat. Try La Pizzeria de Ricci, a small resturant about 5 minutes walk from the hotel, extremley busy but your'll see why once you eat there.

Firstly, the location is good, being only 5 minutes walk from the Termini station and 2 minutes from the Metro. The room itself was spacious but quite basic and a little shabby. There was nothing to make it feel homely. The bed was large, hard and had only 3 pillows! We had to ask for another pillow and ended up with 5! In addition, there were no tea and coffee facilities in the room which, for a 4 star hotel, you do at least expect. We had to go to the bar and request these. They only supplied two milk cartons at a time and we had to go back three or four times for top ups. They also supplied horrible thin plastic cups, both of which split within seconds! Take your own plastic cups with you in your luggage for use by the bed if you want something decent to drink out of at night. The bathroom was clean and spacious and towels etc. replaced as required. The walls were a little thin and you could easily hear guests having a bath next door through the vents. All in all we would rate the room 3 out of 5. The breakfast buffet had a good choice with hot bacon (of a kind) and scrambled egg and frankfurter sausages. However there was a good choice of fruit, cereal and ham, cheese etc. plus croissants, cake and yoghurts. Certainly enough to stock you up for the day! The staff were friendly but wanted to charge us 2 euros for 15 minutes of wifi access which we thought was excessive. We had read reviews on this hotel and were aware that there had been thefts out of the rooms. Consequently we were very aware to always either lock things in our suitcase or take things with us. However, one day I had put my empty handbag in our case and had not locked the case as I did not think it was worth it, there being nothing of value in my bag. However, amazingly, 2 quite ordinary pens were taken from my handbag during the day and the case had obviously been looked in and moved. So beware! There is a safe in the room which we had used without problem. Just dont leave anything lying about that is precious to you. We did not think the hotel was really a 4 star hotel, more like a good 3 star. The hotel is a 30 second walk from the Via Nationale and the bus number 40 will take you directly to St Peters. Buses are one euro per trip and tickets are valid for 75 minutes either on the metro or bus after stamping (on the bus). All the major attractions are also within walking distance. The Trevi fountain at night is better than during the day and not so busy. it would also be a good idea to check if the Pope is due to give a mass at St Peters. We arrived and had to go away and come back as there was no access for another two hours. However, you can watch the mass on the big screens in the square. Eating out is very hit and miss but we found a great little restaurant within about 7 minutes walk from the hotel called Est Est Est. it is down a cul de sac off of the Via Genova. We came upon it by chance and it is busy with italians, always a good sign! It is very reasonably priced and has a great atmosphere. You may have to wait for a table at busy times but tables can be reserved. We reserved a table on our last night and were treated like regulars with complimentary pastries and coffee. A 3 course meal for two is about 40 euros, including wine! Well worth a visit! Do not go into the restaurants close to the main attractions. We went into one for a coffee opposite the colosseum, mainly to warm up! It cost us 7 euros for a sprite, 12 euros for 2 coffees and 8 euros for a small plain pizza. All in all, a bit of a rip off! Unfortunately, we had terrible weather. It rained every day and walking around the colosseum and the forum/palatine when it is cold and rainy is no fun! On the last day it snowed (the first snow in Rome for many years!) and the trains to the airport were a nightmare (and they only had an inch of snow!). A 30 minute journey by train to the airport took 2 hours! However, that was just bad luck. If you are expecting it to rain when you visit Rome then make sure you take an umbrella! Every street corner (and we mean EVERY!) has an umbrella salesman and you will be continually approached. If you dont want to be forever saying no then take your own! When the rain stops they then sell camera tripods!

When we tried to check in were told the air conditioning was not working so they would have us stay at another Best Western several blocks away. We mentioned we really wanted to be with our friends and we were told they did not know when the air would be fixed. We were very disappointed but we walked several blocks away after traveling for 14 hours. Later that evening, we walked back to the hotel to meet our friends and discovered other people were being checked in. We asked if the air conditioning had been fixed and we were told no. Our friends said there was not a problem with air conditioning in their rooms. The next day my room mate called Best Western Headquarters and mentioned what had happened. Before you knew it there was a room available for us complete with air conditioning. The room was quite run down, dark and sad looking. After several days our stay in Rome was over. The 6 of us were on a van headed to a ship for a 12 day cruise. My friend noticed her watch, camera and Ipod were gone. She immediately called the hotel from the van and was told they would look for her things. When we got to the ship I found some of my things were stolen from me too and they would have had to go through my luggage to get the items. My friend called the hotel again and mentioned I was also missing items. They said they couldn't find her items and she would have to send them a letter itemizing what was gone and how much it was worth and they would turn it over to their insurance. To make a long story short, the hotel now refuses to reimburse us and Best Western International says they can't do anything about it. If you do choose to use this hotel, be sure to take the large hunk of metal off the key and take the key with you when you leave the hotel so they do not know you are gone.", "Date": "October 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manassas, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cHotel Mondial is a clean modern hotel convenient to transportation and sites.\u201d", "Author": "darnellgd", "ReviewID": "UR46979658", "Content": "We stayed in the Hotel Mondial four nights before embarking on a Mediterranean cruise for our 50th anniversary.

About a 20 minute walk from the Colosseum and even closer to the Trevi Fountain and Pantheon. The Hotel itself, however, is just average and wouldn't be 4 star by Australian standards. The room we were given was really small with 2 single beds, so we asked for a room with a double bed and got a room that was much larger, it was clean, but the decor is really old and tired. We could hear EVERYTHING going on in the next rooms and hallway which meant we didn't get much sleep - but if you're a heavy sleeper this probably won't bother you. If you want tea & coffee making facilities in your room you have to go down to the bar and get all the stuff yourself, and there is also limited room service. By this I mean you have to go down to the bar and order what you want instead of being able to pick up the phone. The staff were friendly enough, but not overly helpful or forthcoming as they were in other hotels. If you want a basic hotel in a good location then this is it.

My rating is a value for money rating based upon the price paid of \u00a3160 for 3 nights in a twin room. Location is quite good. It is a 10 minute walk from Termini so you don't need to worry about a taxi or underground. It takes about 15 minutes to get to the Colosseum. To get to the Vatican you walk around the corner to the underground station and take it a few stops. It is a little further out than some hotels but all in all the location is decent being at the 'right' side of Termini Station. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. We didn't have any problems but what we asked of them they answered well. The room we had was of a decent size - a little bigger than your standard business 4* hotel in the UK, eg a Marriot. It could do with a revamp but it was extremely clean and the aircon was superb (it was extremely hot when we were there). The bathroom was decent and again extremely clean. There was a safe in our room. There was a TV in the room - only 3 English channels. There was double glazing and we heard no noise from the street (we were on the main st). Breakfast was decent enough as long as you stuck to the continental version. Hot food included hot dogs, scrambled egg and bacon (not too good). There was the normal selection of croissants, bread, ham, cheese, cake, fruit, yoghurts etc. Bearing mind Rome ain't cheap this will save you a few pounds. The communal areas were spacious and comfortable and very clean. I wouldn't say that the hotel is to my style (I prefer modern hotels) but it is still a decent hotel and for the price I paid an absolute bargain - just over \u00a325 each per night! I did a bit of searching to get that price and what I found is that hotel search engines quote wildly differing prices, so shop around.

Our room looked out over the street (Via Torino) but be warned it gets pretty noisy from the constant traffic outside, and particularly on Via Nationale. Also room was a bit stuffy and we had to sleep with the windows open because the air-conditioning system wasn't working. Breakfast was fine, but the waiting staff were a bit over-eager and will lift your plate (finished or not) if you so much as take your eyes off it. They made me pay an additional 60 Euro when i was checking out because they said i didn't stipulate two guests per room - even though i booked and paid for a twin room on the Best Western website. Didn't fight with them because we were rushing for the train back to the airport. Overall good location but the rooms, while clean, are definitely not 4 star and other bits of the hotel look rather run-down (eg elevators).

Bummer. I'll try again. I'll be brief as it's too frustrating to lose the review I was working on. We were able to get three rooms by just walking in off the street. We were so relieved as we had booked at the Sonya Suites and ended up in a dump down the street from that hotel. Deceived by Sonya Suites. The rooms were very shabby but such a step up from the other hotel we almost had to stay in. The beds were hard, as usual. We are convinced that you would have to spend 500 Euros to get a comfortable bed. We were swayed by the Best Western affiliation, but realized that it doesn't mean anything. The quality is not consistent with what we are used to in North America. Still so much better than where we might have had to stay. The irony is that this hotel was less pricey (125 Euros) than the other hotel. Go figure! The breakfast was not great so we ate elsewhere the last two days of our stay at the hotel. If you bring your laptop, the wireless won't work if you use Vista. You will have to reconfigure your internet options and that will lead to a whole heap of trouble for the rest of your holiday. My son and I did this, reconfigure our computers, with the help of the front desk, and we ended up unable to use our internet for the duration of our holiday. It actually took me a good month after my return to Canada to figure out how to get my computer to access the internet. What a hassle. The rooms are very tired and the AC is not up to standard. The walls are paper thin so we had to endure our neighbours having sex. Thank God they were not on their honeymoon. This would not be a great place for a honeymoon anyway. The location is excellent. Just minutes away from the Train and bus terminals and taxis are always going by. The street has a great international marketplace and the restaurant next door is really good. We bought tickets for the ON/OFF bus and were able to travel the city and stop at any of the sites that interested us. In hindsight, we would not buy tickets for these tour buses as the taxis are very reasonable. I had a wonderful experience in Rome, I suffer from Phlebitis and I had a bad flare up and was worried that I wouldn't be able to partake in our adventures in Rome. I did manage to walk to a restaurant the first evening and we went to a pharmacy (look for the green cross), and I told the pharmacist my dilemma. He gave me a packet of pills, that I would have needed a prescription for in Canada, and after one dose, I was ready to walk for miles.

There she was informed there was no spare key and she would need to find the bell boy. 80 years old and a cancer sufferer, she was very upset. I might mention I'm epleptic.

Good location agree with others re distance from Termini. Close to metro for general getting around. Arrived on 19th September in pouring rain which didn't stop all day. We had read about pre booking for Vatican but decided against it. We had read that many of the pre bookings and guided tours commence in morning, that it was therefore better to go in afternoon and avoid Saturdays. With this in mind once we had hotel - we jumped metro and duly arrived at Vatican mid afternoon in pouring rain. Queued for about 30 mins, and have feeling it would have been less but for the rain. which encouraged others. Fantastic. 14 euros. We flew round it due to time constraints and fitted in St Peters afterwards. Also went (via metro) to Trevi Fountain in evening - lovely when lit up and not so crowded. Next day glorious. Breakfast brilliant at hotel and starts at 6.45, great for the early birds, and especially if you are on early morning flight back.

Over the road at Palatine folks could have bought same ticket with much shorter queue. Buy bottles of water or something before going into Palatine/forum, it's a lot of walking, you don't want to rush and nowhere to get liquid refreshments inside. Pantheon impressive, Piazza Navone good fun - watch the painters and the entertainers. Ice cream essential wherever. Okay to eat cost wise- it's the drinks the issue.

Metro station close by and really easy to use. Buy your tickets at the newsagent stand opposite or in the station. Great way to get to St Peter's and the Vatican. All other sites are within walking distance. The railway station and bus station are very close by. We returned to the airport by shuttle bus (Ciampino) - which goes from the railway station. We easily walked to the railway station with all of our luggage on wheels (less than 10 minutes) and the fare was only 6 euro per person. One word of warning. Make sure you know where the bus goes from. There are no signs anywhere. It is actually on Via Marsala at the end of the station closest to the hotel. Check for via Marsala on the map. I think you can also catch the train to Fiumcino airport too from the station but check.. We did have a similar problem when checking in to the hotel to the people from Utah - see their earlier review. I had a stand up row with an objectionable bloke on the desk. There had been a mix up with the booking which they blamed on Best Western. To be fair, we were not 100% blameless but the attitude of the guy was not good. He would probably say the same about me. Anyway, check your booking - room types and number of guests or you may end up like the Utah people. Fortunately, there was also a lady on the desk who together with my wife sorted the problem while I ranted wth the guy, To cut a long story short they solved the problem and were very good about it all in the end. The lady on reception was excellent. Furthermore, her female colleague the next day was superb and gave us great advice about transport etc. She was a star too! The rooms were not brilliant but it was what I expected of a major city centre hotel. Breakfast was okay too. Couple of tips - we stood in the queue for the Colloseum for ages. I think it is possible to buy tickets in advance so look in to that if you can. Also, take the audio guide - it is superb and good value. If you are an EU citizen you also get a discount but need to have some ID. Your EU medical cards are a good idea - saves you carrying passports etc. Also take the audioguide for the Vatican museum and St Peter''s basillica tour. It is excellent too. For the Vatican and the Colliseum you will be offered a personal guide for an extra 20 or so Euros which is tempting if it is hot and there are long queues. However, the wait is never as long as they say and the audioguides are a good way to do it anyway. I'm sure the guided tours are good too if you want to spend the extra cash. If you arrive at Ciampino and need to pick up a hire car you have to wait for a shuttle bus to take you to the pick up offices. It doesn't seem to run very often. After a long flight it is not a good idea to wait around if it is really hot and if the queue is long you may not get on the bus. My tip is walk it!! The offices are within easy walking distance just down the road and to the left. ask for directions or llok it up on the map. Advantage here is you get to the front of the queue too as all the tourists come bashing in after you. Watch out for expensive restaurants close to the hotel.

The bathroom in 402 was adequate with a full tub and reasonable shower. My problem with this hotel is, that for about $300 per night, there was no air conditioning at all. No amount of complaint to the desk or manager had any effect, just a \"sorry, we are working on it\". Perhaps this would not be such a problem at a $40/night Days Inn somewhere but at these prices one should be able to expect a comfortable room. As it was, we had to sleep each night with the window open so as to not suffocate. Rome is not a quiet city and we found it impossible to get a nights rest what with constant traffic noise, the most obnoxious birds (gulls I think) and to our delight, an impromptu fireworks display at about 4AM one morning.

We decided for BW Mondial because Best Western is a well know brand for hotels. The localization ot the hotel is great, one block from the subway station ans three from the central Termini Station, what is really great, lots of nice restaurants and stuff near the hotel. The hotel room was a little old and needs an urgent restoration, but it has a good space, was clean and had a good ans spacious bathroom. The breakfast was very good, with lots of options and very good food. But the problem of this hotel is really the staff. I had read a bad review about them in the booking.com, but I didnt care and now I know I should have. Saying they are rude wouldn\u00b4t be enough. We stayed there for four days, paying an expensive fare and we were treated as if we were in a public lodging. Everything we asked was treated like if they were doing us a favour, since calling a cab to recomend us a restaurant in Trastevere. Bad service would be too little to say about it! In exception of an employee called Fawsil and another guy who was working earlier in the same night and helped us with the key we forgot in the room (he was working at 9 p.m. at sat, 6 oct. I dont remember his name, bus he\u00b4s tall, thin and has dark and little curvy hair. very nice with everyone), that were very kind to us, the others were very very rude, treating us bad and having no patience and understanding with the guests. I was never treated like that in a hotel, no even in youth hostels I stayed in many countries. So, since BW is a weel know brand and this is a 4 star hotel, I really wasn\u00b4t expecting this 'doggy' treatment to guests. So, even though the other things of the hotel are good (room, breakfast, location), all of these qualities are absolutelly anulled by the bad attendance.

The travel agent made a mistake and instead of booking two rooms for myself and my brother in law, she booked a double room (two beds) for 3 people (me, wife, sister-in-law). When we got there and found this out, they insisted we pay for another room even though there were two beds and could easily sleep two couples. Where was my brother-in-law to sleep? They would not help us find another solution, such as paying a little extra for one more person. We are young couples and had budgeted the entire trip around what the travel agent told us it would cost. We could not afford another $230 or so per night for the 4 days we were to spend there. The argument became heated with the management yelling at me, and me yelling back. We came in on a bus late that night, getting there at around 10:30 p.m. It was too late to get another hotel - they were all locked up for the night by the time the argument ended. They would not relent, so my brother in law and myself ended up sleeping at the train station that night. They would not allow more than two people to go up to the room, and were not even going to allow us to put both our (couple's) luggage in the room - only the couple who was staying the night. I just said it was all mine then. I had to haul it all up myself to the room - my brother in law was not allowed to go up. When I and my brother-in-law left they locked the door, and would not even allow my wife and sister to bring down something for us for a pillow (would not unlock doors). In the morning I came back to get showered and help get the luggage down after sleeping on the ground - we were not going to continue staying there. My brother in law waited in the lobby. He overheard them saying something between themselves about calling the police. He used the house phone and called up to the room and I ran down and out to avoid being arrested. My wife later said the bellman did not help her or my sister in law with the luggage on the way out. We found a hotel that morning that while not quite as fancy, was extremely helpful and kind to us. They even let us leave our luggage there after we had checked out while we went sightseeing and waited for transit. To end this, I would not stay there. It is overpriced and the service is abhorrent. It should have been wonderful - it is a Best Western! That symbol is supposed to stand for a level of quality and service! To this day, and forever, I will not stay in a Best Western hotel, no matter where it is at.

It is very close to the main terminal and only a few minutes walk from the Repubblica stop, but we walked everywhere to balance out our indulgent meals! About 20 minutes to the Trevi, 30 to Piazza Navona and the Colosseum. The room's decor and the bathroom were definitely modest, but more importantly, they were very clean and the A/C worked well during the upper 90-degree days we were there. It was a little annoying that the shower would create huge puddles on the floor, but we had enough towels that we just threw one or two down with the bathmat. Front desk wasn't overly friendly, but that seems to be par for the course with the Italian service sector, and they certainly were not rude. The included breakfast was nice enough; wait staff immediately asked if we'd like coffee or tea upon our entrance, and we appreciated being able to have some healthy buffet choices--like yogurt, fruit, and granola--for at least one meal per day! One thing--we asked the front desk about getting us a cab to the airport for an early flight (hence we did not want to mess with the train). They (only) told us about the shuttle service affiliated with the hotel, which was a flat rate of 50 euros. I just read another review here in which someone took a Mercedes for 45 (!) and apparently that was only \"slightly more\" than a cab. So it looks like we probably paid way too much! Lesson learned to do a little more research for airport transportation. Location Info: The few blocks surrounding the hotel are not glamourous, but we certainly felt safe enough walking back at night along Via Nazionale. The hotel is less than a block from the Via Torino intersection, and there is a decent, very reasonably priced restaurant there with standard Italian comfort food. On Via Torino, there are several nice small shops (a Murano glass shop, Italian food specialities, antiques, etc.) and a few nice restaurants along the way. We did not eat at Gigli (others have raved about it) because my husband was wearing shorts; this was irritating since seemingly nicer restaurants did not have a problem with it, especially considering it was so hot even at night! Instead, for a charming setting and an out of this world dinner experience, make a reservation at Latorraca Rosa on Via Farini, a 5 minute walk away. We had a seven course tasting menu for 100 euros that was so delicious, and, as we were one of only two filled tables, we were treated like honored guests! The hotel proved a great location for touring churches; we walked about 30 minutes along Via Merulana to San Giovanni in Laterano, and then worked our way back to the hotel, stopping at San Clemente and Santa Maria Maggiore. There are several other lovely churches (e.g. San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane and Sant'Andrea al Quirinale) within a 15 minute walk as well. All in all, a pretty good deal; we did an \"early web special\" that got us a king bed for about $130 a night.

It is much better than previous reviews may lead people to believe. The problem may be the 4 star rating raises expectations that it is likely to be of a standard similar to an international chain like the Hilton or the Marriott. The Monidal is in a good location. It is directly opposite the Opera Theatre and just off Via Nazionale, one of the main shopping streets. It is round the corner from Piazza Republica which has a Metro station. The Trevi Fountain is about a 15 minute walk. Termini is about 10 minutes in the other direction, but the hotel is far enough away not to attract some of the undesirables seen nearer the station. Our room was very spacious for a city centre hotel, with a full sized bath. The room was clean, but the decoration is a bit spartan. We thought the breakfast was ok for a city centre hotel, with a reasonable choice of hot and cold items. The staff when we checked in were very friendly and helpful. I must admit that when we checked out, the receptionist had a manner probably described as briskly efficient. He was very impatient with some other guests, but in fairness I had every sympathy with him given the inane questions they were asking. The staff reflect the Roman character of the hotel. If you want staff with a permanent smile who are programmed to wish you a nice day, you are probably better off at a Marriott or Hilton. If you want some real character, the Mondial is just fine. The Ristorant Giglo 2 doors down is a very good restaurant but it is at the pricier and posher end of the scale. We paid 100 euros for a 2 course meal with a bottle of house red, which we thought was reasonable value for money. There are also a couple of little bars/cafes either side of the hotel with a few pavement tables. We spent some time sipping morning cappuccinos and one late evening with a bottle of Vino Rosso watching the world go by and playing \"guess the nationality\". Italians were easy to spot as they are so incredibly, and effortlessly, stylish. We used Stefano's car service for the journey from the Airport based on TA recommendations, to which we can now add. 45 euros one way is only a bit dearer than a standard taxi and worth paying for the luxury of a new Mercedes. We would recommend you use a tour guide service to get the best out of the sights. We used Via Tours for the Colosseum and Palantine and Romatours for the Vatican. Both tours were over 3 hours long, very interesting but did involve a fair amount of walking. Two final recommendations - do not try to drive yourself in Rome! The driving is absolutely manic. On both our journey from and to the airport we saw scooter riders who had been knocked off their bikes and we spoke to other travellers who seen similar collisions. Finally beware a friendly little chap at the Spanish Steps who will engage you in conversation and then starts twisting a friendship bracelet around your little finger.

Located just off Via Nazionale, it's surrounded by restaurants and there's a SPAR supermarket nearby. Check-in isn't until 3pm but the hotel staff are happy to stow away your luggage until you check-in. Reception was polite, not exactly chirpy! Our room was quite big and I had earlier requested a quieter room which is what we got. The room and bathroom were all very clean which is very good by my standards! The decor is a bit dated, and we didn't have a view but that was fine with us. Breakfast at the hotel is very good - there's a wide selection to suit all. Also, there is access to the internet in the reception area. We managed to visit all the tourist attractions on our 'hit list' in good time. Plus have time to eat lots of yummi gelato! And we took pictures of all the Illuminati markers as read in Dan Brown's Angels & Demons! Helpful hints: if you buy a telephone card to call home, free phone numbers are at no extra cost if you use the hotel phone (comfier than using the public payphones!). If you plan to visit the Colosseum, the best time to go is first thing in the morning - hardly any queues. The guided tour is quite informative and cheap at only EUR 3.50. 110 Bus tour from Termini is very good - at EUR 13.00 it goes to all the 'major' tourist attractions. If you want good views of Rome, you should climb up St. Peter's dome - a bit claustrophobic when you climb up and down but the views are excellent! NB. women need to cover their shoulders and knees when visiting St.Peter's basilica and most churches - we saw many people turned away for not being covered up! All in all, a good trip although July is veryvery hot! I would recommend this hotel if you need a place to crash after a long day's exploring.

We found the hotel to be an excellent choice, especially for visitors who plan on spending most of their time on the go. Location: The location is excellent. The hotel is located about 3 blocks from the Termini Station, meaning visitors can take a train from Fiumicino (Leonardo DaVinci) Airport to the hotel in about 30 minutes, eshewing more costly taxi cabs, which were on strike for a portion of our visit. Termini is also home to a Metro station, the only station in the system where both lines meet, making it ideal for tourists planning to use bus and metro for most of their traveling. The hotel is even closer (1.5 blocks) to another metro stop (Piazza de Republica), which takes you to popular locations like the Vatican, Vatican Museums, Spanish Steps, and Trevi Fountain. Finally, if you are interested in traveling outside of Rome, as we did to Assisi, being near Termini provides easy and prompt access to TrenItalia and Eurostar service throughout the region. Beyond transportation, Hotel Mondial is located across the street from the Opera House, and one block from Via Nationale, a main thoroughfare that is home to many restaurants and shops. For English-speaking Catholics, the hotel is just two blocks from St. Sussana's Church - which offers both Sunday and daily (6 p.m.) masses in English. Like most others in the city, the church is beautiful; and it was enjoyable to attend mass in my native language one evening. Additionally, St. Mary Major, one of the four major basilica's in Rome, is located about 4 blocks away; and St. Mary of the Angels, a beautiful church built among the remnants of an ancient bath, is just 1.5 blocks away. Rooms We found our room to be simple yet comfortable. It was very clean and the bathroom appeared to be recently renovated. In short, it met our expectations and was a great place to be able to come back to, take a shower, and sleep. The inclusive breakfast was plentiful and tasty, giving us a good start to long days in very hot weather. It started at 6:45 a.m., perfect for days in which we wanted to get an early start. The staff were very polite and bilingual. They were happy to answer questions and relay phone messages. Overall views: My wife and I enjoyed our trip to Rome very much, including our stay at the Hotel Mondial. We would return to the Hotel Mondial without question, and we wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to visitors, especially those who are not looking to spend significant sums of money on logging and who are primarily interested in a clean, comfortable, and safe location near transportation and major sites.", "Date": "July 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNothing special\u201d", "Author": "janicems", "ReviewID": "UR5447981", "Content": "We spent 2 weeks in Italy and decided to stay somewhere simple in Rome as we were not intending to spend much time in the room as there is so much to see.

At this rate, frankly, I certainly did not expect the Ritz but was pleasantly surprised upon arriving at the hotel. As promised, the hotel is an easy walk of about four blocks from Rome's Stazione Termini. Check-in was prompt and efficient and my prepaid reservation was immediately acknowledged. The room to which we were assigned was somewhat dated in decor (as was the lobby), although it was larger than most we've stayed in in Europe and the bathroom was enormous. Best of all, everything was clean and tidy and worked properly, from lamps to the plumbing fixtures to the airconditioning unit. We found the bed to be very comfortable (we like a firm mattress) and the linens and towels were spotless and soft. Breakfast was filling and more than adequate and no questions were asked when we requested an additional pot of coffee in the breakfast room. We briefly made use of the hotel's free internet connection to check emails and the only other time I asked for assistance (with dialing a local phone number), my request was answered promptly, politely and correctly. I am somewhat perplexed by the negative reviews of this hotel. Had I not found the rate I found on the Best Western website, I could have just as easily paid hundreds of Euros more per night for something elsewhere in Rome with no guarantee of anything as nice as the Mondial. If you want five stars in Rome, it is going to cost you at lest 500+ Euros/night. If you are looking for clean, central and more than adequate accomodations (with a good breakfast) at a decent price, check out the Mondial's prepaid rates.

The lobby looked like 3 stars, at most, but from then on it goes downhill....The service was terrible, concierges were borderline rude and ignored some of the questions i asked them or gave me very short, abrupt answers. The room....the room was downright scary....although decently sized (by European standards) the decor was awful, brownish pink....the beds were extra hard and the pillows lumpy....extra blankets in the closet were thin and felt like sand paper.... The bathroom was nice, fairly large and very clean, so no complaints there. The breakfast was average, i expected way way more for 250 euros per night...

The room itself is awful! The size is good by US standards and big by European standards, but thats it. The decoration looks like a cheap, cheesy motel built in the early 80s and havent been updated since. The whole thing, from the carpet, to the closet is puke, greyish pink. The headboard is a ridiculous gold color, as are the lamps and the chairs look like worse than your grandmothers drapes, 50 years ago! The beds are incredibly hard and uncomfortable. The pillows are thin and lumpy. The best way to describe it, is a 2 star MOTEL in Las Vegas. Worst of all, the price was around $235 a night!! For this, in the U.S. you wouldve paid $30, if that. Immediately, we went on TripAdvsor and found Hotel Giuliana - a GREAT hotel, nearby. Its rated a 2 star and has very basic accomodations, but THE SERVICE!! Wow.
