However, they were clearly having issues with the housekeeping. We stayed for 5 nights and, NOT ONCE, was the apartment serviced properly. The problems ranged from the major - NO servicing at all one day - to the minor - the removal of a set of towels, leaving one set for 2 people. Additionally, a little more friendliness from the front desk would be nice. One last point: we had not realised that the building is not airconditioned - and a fan doesn't make it.

The Elfchen is simply a very nice hotel room with a little kitchenette in the entrance to the room. There is no sofa and no dining table, but there is a little desk and a small square table in a little nook in the corner, suitable for one. We raised this point when we arrived and were immediately upgraded to the \u201cBallade\u201d (I have added photos of both). The Ballade has a good size dining table, armchair, and a big walk in wardrobe plus a good size kitchenette with microwave, hob, fridge, toaster, coffee maker & kettle. We also had big French windows which added to the feeling of luxury and space. Some tea & coffee, sugar, salt & pepper is provided. Umbrellas are also provided for guests so no need to take up space in your case! The d\u00e9cor is great \u2013 modern with a boutique hotel feel. It was also spotlessly clean. The bed, which is 2 twin mattresses, is not particularly luxurious, rather hard and with very thin duvets, but the hotel was warm so this wasn\u2019t too much of a problem. You only get one thin pillow too, so perhaps bring your own! Along these lines we felt the towels were a bit thin and worn, which didn\u2019t match the luxurious d\u00e9cor and boutique style bathroom (a \u2018wellness\u2019 shower with massage jets \u2013 fabulous!). However, this didn\u2019t detract from the quality of our stay, which we felt to be extremely good value for money. The gentleman on reception was very helpful, albeit he pops out for a cigarette break quite frequently leaving a \u201cback shortly\u201d notice on the door! But he is only gone for a few minutes, which was handy as he was no where to be seen when we arrived! Breakfast is about 14 euros, but we chose to use the supermarket (about a ten minute walk away) and cater for ourselves, although the breakfast room looked very trendy! The total journey from Berlin Schoenefeld airport to the hotel is approx 1 and half hours. From platform 13 take the S9, (direction Pankow), change at Ostkreuz and from platform 4 take the S3 (direction Spandau). It is then an easy 10 min walk from Zoologische garten station. The hotel is situated on a quiet street in the lovely area of Charlottenburg, full of old bookshops, and traditional crafts such as shoemakers, framers, tailors and a beautiful old fashioned perfumerie.

My husband, my mother, her friend and I all stayed for a week at Goethe 87. It stands tall as the best deal we encountered in Europe, we all loved it. These hotel rooms are like small apartments and include their own doorbell, kitchenettes, and balconies. They are tasteful, sleek and appointed with the best features, such as Gaggenau stoves and refrigerators, gorgeous French doors that swing open or hinge at the bottom for a breeze, push-button shade closures and high-end fixtures throughout. Our room had a lovely view and was very quiet. The bathroom shower is a dream, equipped with a Grohe wellness apparatus that shoots water at you from various heights, culminating in a large rainshower head and a hand-held sprayer. The entire impression is Euro-style and upscale. There is daily cleaning service, despite the apartment schematic. There is free onsite laundry service and wireless internet, unheard of at their rate. The reception and Bistro staff were utterly professional and always helpful. They lent us an English book on what to do in Berlin, and when we couldn\u2019t figure out the shower workings, someone came right to our room and demonstrated for us. They lent us an umbrella when it rained and even faxed for us. If we called for something, it was immediately addressed. We were very impressed. We did have a concern with the cleaning staff, but that was quickly rectified and apologized for. Goethe 87 is in what was once one of the most fashionable parts of town, Charlottenburg. The trend factor loss to the east is our gain in the west, as staying in Charlottenburg is now less expensive than say Berlin Mitte or nearer to the gate. Bearing in mind that Berlin had the best transportation system we encountered, anywhere you stay is accessible to the city centers, and Goethe 87 is surrounded by excellent shopping and varied restaurant choices. When you stay at Goethe 87 you feel you are absorbed into the lifestyle of Berlin. The post office is across the street, the apothecary is around the corner, the grocer is down the street and the Kurfurstendam is a few blocks away\u2014life goes on around you as it would for a local; the environment is authentic Berlin. Berlin is a lush, fascinating, historic and vibrant city with an international flair, don\u2019t bypass it, and get out to museum island! Surrounding the city are a multitude of relaxing parks, quaint lakeside towns (Tegel-am-see), and castle areas (don\u2019t miss the Potsdam Palaces). There is an active art scene. I loved Berlin and Goethe 87 made it truly comfortable and memorable for our entire group. A++!", "Date": "September 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cAwesome stay\u201d", "Author": "robobok", "ReviewID": "UR5724279", "Content": "The hotel is situated in a quiet area of Berlin, Charlottenburg. It's on walking distance (10mins) of the Zoo Station and the Kurfurstendamm. The rooms are big. We booked a 35 square meter Studio Ballade for 98 euros per night. The studio's interior is very modern and looks brandnew. On first entrance, the hotel staff has left a nice green apple on top of your pillow. Other cool features: nice big windows that can be opened; an LCD tv; a nice kitchenette incl. micro wave and complete set of glasses, plates, etc. But the hottest of all features is the generous bathroom with wellness shower! God, we loved taking (long!) showers in this hotel. In fact it's a shower with 4 massaging water sources (whats that called in English? Shower heads?). Staff is very friendly and helpful too.", "Date": "August 29, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Apartmenthaus Goeth87", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d490876-Reviews-Apartmenthaus_Goeth87-Berlin.html", "Price": "$98 - $524*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Goethestrasse 87</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10623</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "490876", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/9d/8c/9d8c516e9411e4c6b6d06bc7645e77647large.jpg"}}
