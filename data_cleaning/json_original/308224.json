In fact, the room at Richmond hotel apartments was slightly more expensive than said hotels and based on the assumption of a relation between price and hotel standard, we decided to give Richmond Hotel Apartments a shot. Now, while the foyer in the photograph provided on several websites is indeed that of Richmond Hotel Apartments, it must be several years old! These days it looks run down, messy and the couch has been replaced by two 1 Dirham massage chairs! The pictures of the outside of the hotel are equally misleading -the place is surrounded by large sandy areas that are used as parking lots. The hotel is also located on a busy road and the traffic and occasional shouting from outside made for a bad night's sleep. AC in the hallways did not work. No bed covers. Cleanliness On the way to our room, we were greeted by a \"liquid\" stained-mattress that was standing in the hall way, and was not removed until several hours later. Entering our allocated room, the first thing we noticed was an unpleasant smell - a mixture of mould and cold smoke! The furniture and equipment of this place are of older date, which in itself is not a problem. However, stains and holes in the bed linens, mould in the shower and kitchen, as well as hairs of the previous guest in the bed and on the floor are! Generally, flat surfaces of any kind were sticky, patches of wallpaper were missing in several places and the safety deposit box did not work. Thick layers of dust and grease in the kitchen and living room. Only 1 semi-clean towel in double-bed room. Staff The receptionists wanted to hang on to our passports for several hours only agreed to make copies etc . immediately after several firm requests. Had to follow up on taxi request, as the receptionist had forgotten first request, since he was busy chatting with one of his mates/colleagues! Generally staff did not seem to care, but this relates probably to the wider problem with working conditions and dubious working contracts for foreign workers in the UAE. Internet The wireless connection is very slow and during our stay went on and off in 1 or 2 min intervals. We therefore used the computers provided in the \u201cbusiness centre\" (2 PCs with dirty keyboards \u2013 bring disinfectant along!). Gym Very small space with four or five machines (stationary bike etc) and some small weights. Small and dark place - AC did not seem to work and temperatures must have been 20C+ on that floor. Bottom line Receptionist said that they consider themselves a 3 Star hotel. This is, in light of our experiences, a complete joke. It is mainly the un-cleanliness of the place, as well as the misleading information about the hotel's standard that are not acceptable. Under better management, this place could actually be quite decent. We tried to find alternative lodging for the night, but all other hotels in the area were booked out - so we had to stay the night at Richmond Hotel. In its current state, this is a 1 star hotel at best - we have been to the UAE several times and have a pretty good idea of what's out there in terms of hotels and hotel apartments. If they would offer 50dhs rooms, at least you'd know what you're getting into - but this place gives false impressions and seems to base its rates on that information. The hotel\u2019s location is OK and Al Karama Metro station is only a 20min walk away. However, as a result of the sum of the mentioned problems this is without doubt the worst place I have stayed in and would therefore not recommend Richmond Hotel Dubai to anyone.

Got there and first impressions were okay. No hairdryer, but had luckily packed my own. No safe. No toaster, but they brought me one up as soon as I asked for it. No kettle, but I'd brought my own. Big balcony, but no furniture on the balcony. Patio door tricky to lock. As for cleanliness.....................hmmm. The \"maid\" at the hotel is a 16 year old boy, and it shows. Dust swept into corners and left there. Rusty nail stayed on the floor by the door for the whole of my 6 night stay. Long blonde hairs on the pillows when I arrived. Toilet leaks on the floor, but luckily it appeared to be clean water. Slightly grubby, but I tried to keep cheerful, as it was so cheap. This place is miles from anywhere. You need a taxi to get to the metro station, then a taxi when you get off the metro to wherever you are going. I walked everywhere the first day, and I was exhausted! Luckily, each taxi journey is only about \u00a32. Getting from the airport in a normal taxi cost less than \u00a310. Bargain. The hotel's own car is a bit expensive - I paid 30 AED (about \u00a38) to go to the souks, and a normal taxi would probably have been cheaper. I took some tinned food in my suitcase, jam, coffee, flora spread and some bread. I was able to make some breakfast and dinner in the room, as there is a microwave and toaster, and it saved me a bit of money. Local bread is wierdly sweet. Some local men are a bit rude - they don't hold open doors for you, or say thank you if you do it for them. Also, the traders at the souk can get on your nerves a bit by trying to get you in their shops, calling out to you, being a bit sleazy. A firm \"No Thank You\" does the trick. All in all, so long as you are aware that you'll need to go everywhere in the (fairly cheap) taxis, and are prepared for below-standard cleanliness, this place will do you fine. It was cheap enough to remain fairly cheerful about it all.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denmark", "Title": "\u201cSpend more and go somewhere else...\u201d", "Author": "xazzo", "ReviewID": "UR95414575", "Content": "Yes, it IS very cheap for Dubai...but you get what you pay for.

The rooms in the hotel were good, had a nice bathroom and a small cooking area. The hotel swimming pool was also quite good, and there was a nice view of the dubai skyline. The best thing about this hotel was the service. We had booked the room for one night and had to check out at 12 in the afternoon.

There is no excuse for poor customer service though and that's what we found when talking to the staff at reception - the concierge was nice though. Beware: they will ask you for your passport & they will hold onto it (apparently they require it to copy & send to the local police in case you get up to no good while staying in Dubai). My partner and I did not like the idea of leaving our passports with these people but did so and told the guy we wouldn't leave them with him for very long - we picked them up off him within half an hour but he didn't seem happy). We were taken to our room but as we walked down the dim corridor there were wires hanging from the roof!! Our room was okay and we slept well but the bathroom was small, the room had a view of other buildings and a noisy road and the room service food really wasn't that great. When you book a room in this hotel it claims it has a kitchen in the room which we thought would be handy instead of eating out all the time. We discovered that the 'kitchen' is only a bench and fridge with a couple of plates and ONE cup! You can't cook or heat anything up & you have to request extra cups. The swimming pool is on the roof & is very shallow so not that great and the gym is laughable - I wouldn't call it a gym, just a couple of old machines & a treadmill on it's last legs! The area isn't too bad, there is a supermarket just up the road which is handy & the Al Karama markets are within walking distance (about 20min walk) or a short taxi ride (taxi's are very cheap).

I was really looking forward to it as I had heard so much about the place and it was the first time we were taking my 4 year old son on holiday. we arrived at Dubai airport and are pick up which was arranged through the hotel was late, we had to phone the hotel to find out what was happening, they told us that it will be there in 15 minutes, we ended up waiting an hour in total from the time we come through customs. when he finally turned he realised there was not enough room in the minibus as there was 12 people which also meant 12 suitcases and 10 hand luggages, so he had to call for another mini bus, which there should of know already cause of the number of us in the group. We then finally arrived at the hotel and was given our room keys and had to give them are passports which we had to live with them for them to scan them, which I found quite odd. Finally got to our rooms at first glance the room looks OK. the room had a smell like damp, holes in the chairs, the room was not suitable for 2 adults and a child, there was just a king size bed in the room, we requested a bed for my son, the bedroom was small so they could not fit another bed in it which means they would be putting it in the front room, when they did come up with the bed, it turned out to be a cot. my son is 4 years old and not a baby how can you expect me to put him to sleep in a cot. with in also this time we had been up down to reception to complain about 5 times. They finally told us some other rooms well be free in the morning about 12 noon and we will be able to look at them and change room. while this was going on other people in are group were having the same or worst problems, bathroom dirty, fridge rusty, smelly rooms, no hot water, and also after moving rooms three times they still wasn't happy. i was going to wait till the morning to see what else was on offer. But same members of are group was so unhappy about the room they had that they were not prepared to sleep the night there, so they rang up the booking company in England and made a complaint. with in a hour they were taken to view a different hotel 2 minutes away called the Jormand Hotel which was cleaner and nicer then the Richmond hotel. so the next morning we were all transferred to the Jormand hotel [----] My advise if you going to Dubai for holiday to relax go to Jumeirah beach hotel it might be more expensive but in the long run it would be better cause you don't have to pay a lot on taxi fares every day to go to the beach.

After crashing out for a couple of hours, as we had travelled through the night, we woke up, unpacked & had our showers. At this point (3 hours after we had checked in) Michelle, the receptionist, calls & says, that the studio is now available & to please check out & move to the new room! We were put off & told her that we had already unpacked & we were tired after our long flight & it was grossly unfair to ask us to do so in such a short period. She vociferously insisted that she had told us that she was only giving us the room for a few hours & we now had to move. If she had told us that, we would not have unpacked & made ourselves comfortable- she was blatantly lying to cover up some mistake from her side. She kept insisting howver & said that another person had already paid for the suite we were in & so we agreed to move to the studio. We moved to the studio & left for shopping etc. & only came back late night. That's when we discovered, the bathroom door did'nt shut, the shower had no force at all, water came out in a drip, flush did'nt work & the safe in the room did'nt work as well. We called reception, dear Michelle again & told her about the faults. Her first reaction was to tell us that the previous tenant of the room had not made any complaints! We asked her to come to the room & check for herself if she thought we were making it up. She immediately said she was not allowed to do so, but grudgingly said that she would send the maintenance people up. 3 calls & 2 hours later no sign of any. we went down & told her that no one had come & all she could say was 'I've told the maintenance people, if they dont come what can I do?' - her exact words. What were we supposed to do? We told her that we were going out & if the room was not done by the time we returned, we would be checking out - her reaction - 'upto you'. No apologies, no assuarances. We did try to get rooms elsewhere, but as it was the wekend & the DSF was on we had no luck anywhere & we were forced to stay there. The flush was the only thing fixed & the maintenance people told us that the shower was faulty & short of changing it nothing could be done. My conclusion is that the room they gave us was up fpr maintenance & therefore was not available when we checked in. Later due to some mix-up, we were forced to move & had to put up with this crappy room. No one from the management side apologised or told us that things would be put right. Rooms are dated, but of decent size. Bathroom tiles were mouldy, carpet had stains. Location is terrible as you never get taxis anywhere. Cant imagine what it would be like in summer.
