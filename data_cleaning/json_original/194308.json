We wanted to go to a luxurious Paris hotel, but didn't want a large hotel. Yet, I was somewhat hesitant about a small hotel, fearing that it might be worn or without some of the niceties we desired for our 40th anniversary. We read many reviews and decided on Hotel d'Aubusson, and I'm delighted that we did. The hotel is extremely charming, and everything is very well cared for and up to date. For example, we watched a woman employee freshen up the paint on the outdoor chairs and tables over the course of three days, which are in a small courtyard and is the only place in the hotel where smoking is permitted. Everything looked as though it were just redone, except the charming, old ceiling beams which are throughout the hotel.Our junior suite was a nice size, with flat screen TV, mini bar, a king size bed, which was very comfortable, and a lovely, generous, marble bathroom. The courtesy toiletries were by Hermes and the service was absolutely perfect. Everyone at the hotel spoke English, with Royce, who greeted us upon arrival and showed us our room, having been born in America and who spoke with an American accent, when he was not speaking impeccable French. He, Audrey and all the staff were as helpful and accomodating as they could be, and we felt 100% comfortable and at home. The head concierge, whose name I believe is Jean Vernaz, was also very helpful. He is very pleasant and had a contagious smile and sense of good cheer. We opted for the breakfast option at the hotel, which was a very good buffet of eggs, bacon (the best I've ever had), sausage, a variety of croissants, toast, cheeses, fruit, cereal and other items, and is offered from 7:30AM to 11:30AM, so you don't have to get up early to enjoy the breakfast. We arrived a couple of times at 11:15AM and the buffet was fully stocked and we were not hurried at all. There is a cafe which offers a jazz quartet on Saturday, which was excellent, and other music entertainment Wednesday through Friday. Quite frankly, we almost didn't go to the hotel because of the jazz, as one review indicated it could be noisy. Not only did we not hear it from our room (309), but we actually were disappointed that the live music was not there Sunday through Wednesday, as we found all the entertainers excellent and it was very pleasing to have this available at the hotel. In all, I believe anyone who is looking for a small, elegant, luxurious, friendly hotel will find Hotel d\"Aubusson perfect. And, I should add that the neighborhood is full of small shops, restaurants, cafes and art galleries. We walked to the Musee d'Orsay (perhaps 15-20 minutes), and did not take the metro once, as we had to do several years ago when we stayed closer to the Champs Elysee. If we return to Paris, there is no doubt that we will again stay at Hotel d'Aubusson. My compliments to the management and staff of this wonderful hotel.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cPerfect!\u201d", "Author": "mjruch", "ReviewID": "UR126560365", "Content": "What a wonderful oasis! This hotel is quiet and extremely comfortable. The beds were great, there were enough fluffy pillows, our bathroom was spacious with an enormous tub, walk-in shower, and DOUBLE sinks ( a real plus, since I was sharing a room with a childhood friend)! The room was cleaned daily, and each evening we came home to a new little gift--macarons, chocolates, etc. The bar and salon were great, especially the salon, which had a real, wood burning fireplace and several grouped seating areas with period furniture. The salon is located in the old, former monastery part of the hotel. Fresh flowers abounded. The complimentary breakfast offered scrambled eggs, bacon (a little on the limp side), sausage, beans (not a staple at an American table), various breads, pastries, wonderful cheeses, fresh fruit, tomatoes, spreads, pancakes, fresh juices, coffee, and more! GRAND by European standards. The front desk staff could not have been more helpful or polite. Royce, in particular, was so nice to us. Having grown up in the States with one French parent, he was just what we needed to help us navigate a couple of problems that required a multi-lingual approach and panache! They were all multi-lingual and were great with directions, suggestions and general assistance. The location of the hotel is only a couple of blocks from the Pont Neuf; therefore, the Louvre, Notre Dame (and all the sights on the islands) were within easy walking distance. (Crossing the Seine on the Pont Neuf is about the distance of a city block--not like crossing the Mississippi River from Tennessee to Arkansas--so if this is your first trip to Paris, don't let the map take on gigantic proportions in your mind.) We were also only a few blocks from the metro, which is easy to navigate and felt very safe. Also, just a couple of blocks down the street is the charming and very historic (1693) restaurant, Le Procope! Have your cameras ready and go with a healthy appetite. We stayed at Hotel d'Aubusson in the middle of March and enjoyed their special winter rates. Splitting the room made it more affordable, and our junior suite (think that is what is was called) was flat-out spacious compared to other places I've stayed! Like a good old American hotel, like H.I. or Hyatt, but with a better bathroom! ONLY complaint about the hotel was that sometimes--not every time--it took 10 minutes or so for the hot water to reach the fifth floor!

On earlier visits to Paris, we had stayed at different hotels each time, but since finding the d'Aubusson we haven't stayed anywhere else. The staff is always unfailingly polite and helpful. There was a misunderstanding about which rooms have king beds, and I mistakenly booked a room with a double bed, but when I talked to the front desk staff they were so nice. They were able to move us to a larger room w/ a king bed at no additional cost. We also had a note welcoming us back, w/ a bottle of champagne, when we returned to our room after dinner that night. The concierge was a great help in confirming dinner reservations, via email exchanges before we arrived and in person during our stay. I also want to note that even the rooms facing the rue Dauphine are very quiet. I am a light sleeper, so a quiet room is important to me. The sound proofing is so good that you never hear street noise. The bar off the lobby has such a warm, cozy atmosphere. My husband and I enjoyed having a drink there before dinner in the evening, before it got crowded w/ people enjoying the life music. We will try to spend more time there on our next visit! One practical tip, especially for women--the hair dryers in the rooms are really difficult to use for styling your hair. Rather than an on/off switch, you have to keep a button on the handle pushed in for it to be \"on\". Try to mimic this the next time you are styling your hair w/ a blow dryer, with a brush in one hand, and you will quickly see how painful/impossible it is. The dryer turns off everytime you move your hand. Bring a little dual voltage travel dryer if this is important to you. Our thanks and appreciation to all the staff.

We booked a deluxe room on a summer package at 395 euros a night for four nights. Upon check-in, we were taken to a two level room--bathroom and living area on the first level and king-sized bed in the loft. Due to the extremely low ceiling in the loft, I knew that at 6'1'' I was at serious risk of bumping my head, especially getting out of bed. So we rejected the room. No problem. We were transferred immediately to another room, less spacious but nice enough. Suffering from jet lag, we simply assumed that this was a \"deluxe\" room too. Our stay was enjoyable. Paris was our first destination on a fifteen day trip. It was also our final destination. During the trip, we decided to return to the d'Aubusson for our final night. We booked a \"superior\" room on the summer package at 280 euros. Curiously, our superior room was larger than our deluxe room two weeks earlier. In fairness, our first room had a nicer bathroom but not 115 euros/night nicer--not by a long shot. Even considering the possibility that prices were a little higher in early July than late July, this huge price differential for practically the same room is troubling. So, before booking a room reservation at the d'Aubusson--which we still recommend--call or email the hotel to determine the difference in size and amenities for superior versus deluxe room.

Royce, Jean, Coralee and Audrey are first class!! They are all friendly, accomodating and provide some excellent recommendations. When the Musee D'Orsay was on strike (as I hear happens quite often!) Jean recommended the Marmotten Monet, a small lesser known Impressionist museum on the outskirts of Paris. It was an easy bus ride across town and it was very impressive. We loved it. Ask Royce for restaurant recommendations-they were both great! They all helped us with our very weak french so that we could navigate Paris much better. My husband especially loved Cafe Laurent. The music was terrific and Laurent is the consommate host. Thank you to everyone at Hotel d'Aubusson we hope that we will be able to visit you all again soon! Beintot!

During dinner, I mentioned to Mrs. Spove that we were staying at the Relais St. Germaine. She then suggested that we check out the hotel her husband manages, the Hotel D'Aubusson. So, we decided to do just that in our return trip in October 2011. We loved staying at this hotel more than the Relais St. Germain for several reasons. 1) The Service at the reception area is outstanding. They are always friendly and patient versus sometimes cold and rude at the Relais St. Germain. Here 's an example of this hotel's patience. They helped me several times in getting. files to print on several different occasions. Service is always greeted with a smile. 2) Hermes bath products are used at the Hotel d' Aubusson and replenished daily. The Relais St. Germaine uses a less standard brand and does not replenish them daily. 3) The bathroom in the Hotel d'Aubusson is larger and more modern than the Relais St. Germain. 4) The Hotel d'Aubusson offers promotions that are a great value. 5) The rooms are more tastefully decorated that gives you a Paris feeling versus at the Relais St. Germaine the decor is too busy. 6) The beds are more comfortable and the rooms are larger at this hotel. 7) The jazz bar at this location is the best. It's nice to come back after sightseeing and having a nice dinner to hear the wonderful music at the jazz bar. It makes the night end on a perfect note.

Hotel D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Aubusson is your place. This was our 40th anniversary, we had high expectations and they were exceeded. Thanks first go to Jill Jergel of Frontiers Travel who, for several months, politely but firmly kept routing us back to the D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Aubusson despite our early preference for someplace else. Although our stay was short (6 nights), we were overwhelmed by the patience, flexibility and responsiveness of the staff. Allow me to single out Laurent (sp), whose English was so good, I accused him of really being an English public school and Oxford grad. My first faux pas no doubt. But Laurent was just one of the many staff who were immediately there to answer questions, provide recommendations, solve problems and make sure your stay was memorable. Whether it was the wait staff in the breakfast room, the bartender, the doormen and baggage staff, room attendants, all went out of their way to specifically address your needs and make you feel welcome. I observed how they dealt with all the guests and not just us. We had a grande luxe room and took advantage of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Romance Package\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The room was in the old section of the hotel with exposed wooden beam ceilings overlooking the courtyard (ask specifically for those rooms). Plenty big enough, very comfortable, nice sized bathrooms and a whirlpool tub to die for. The jets nearly ejected me out of the bath! Breakfast service was wonderful. So substantial you could almost skip lunch. I have to single out the rhubarb preserves -- a personal preference so please don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell them I absconded with 3-4 little jars and brought them home in my carry ons.... As part of the Romance package, we had our choice of tickets to the Louvre or the Orangerie, a concert service in St. Chapelle (don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss the Rose window), a private champagne lunch for 2, private airport pickup (boy was that crucial at 5 am on a flight 75 minutes early!), a bateaux (boat) excursion, and breakfast included. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d also include VIP treatment per their prospectus but they treat all guests that way. Talk about scoring points with the boss. The jazz concerts in Cafe Laurent are amazing and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to check out it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history.

The staff were all friendly and there was quite a large choice of breakfast items, with you being able to eat as much as you wanted and it was all very nice. As for the location, it's fantastic for arriving from the airport by train, easy to stroll to many of the major tourist sites and easily accessible to the metro for trips further afield or slightly away from the main Parisian centre. There are loads of restaurants and cafes in the near vicinity too. However, there are a few points that I would make and these are made because of the cost of a nightly stay - \u00c2\u00a3285 for 2 people b&b at current exchange rates - and for no other reason. I did put these comments on a card at the end of our stay. We realise Paris is not a cheap city but have visited several times before, staying in cheaper hotels that have given better value for money. Sorry! The breakfast service - we found the clearing of tables very slow and as there are only a few tables, they have to be used several times during the long breakfast serving. The first morning, they ran out of cutlery and teapots and there was a comparatively small selection of bread and pastries. This may well have been due to the time we went down for breakfast but even so....The choice improved on other mornings and items were filled up quicker but the staff were still relatively slow at clearing tables and attending to people. They were nice enough staff but I almost felt like getting a tray and clearing some pots myself! My next 'issue' is with the standard of housekeeping in the room. It wasn't bad but the room was not hoovered until we requested it be done on the third day - we came back part way through the day and the bits on the floor from day 1 were still there. When we came back later, it had been done but I believe that it should be done daily in a hotel of this standard and price. I also note that previous reviewers have mentioned this lack of hoovering. Also, on the third day, we found one curtain had partially come down and hadn't been attended to when we came back. This was mentioned at the same time as the hoovering and rectified. We also found they left one small bottle of water for us on arrival but that was it. Again, I think that at this price, it should be standard to leave a bottle of water for each guest every day they are there. We could have used the ones in the minibar but I refuse to pay those prices! These may seem like picky things to mention but they make up part of the overall stay and I don't think should happen in a 4* quality hotel. So overall, a nice hotel to stay in, in a fabulous location but overpriced by 25% in our opinion. \u00c2\u00a3200 a night would have been nearer the mark.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cNever come to paris and not stay here\u201d", "Author": "NLPP_11", "ReviewID": "UR116747655", "Content": "This was the fourth time that we have stayed at the D'aubusson.

So many to choose from, conflicting reviews and where to stay, right or left bank. This was my first time in Paris and I was traveling with my whole family (8). I finally decided on the left bank and the Hotel d'Aubusson. I was not disappointed. First of all I am so glad I chose the Left Bank as it was only a 5 minute walk from our hotel over the bridge to the right bank and many Paris attractions. When we returned back to the hotel at night we were surrounded by an entire neighborhood of restaurants, cafe's and bars. It is so beautiful to wander around the area. Everyone is sitting outside, music is playing. Wonderful area to be in and felt very safe. We were within walking distance to most of the main sightseeing sights. The Eiffel Tower was a good 45 minute walk but in going there you pass many other sights and it is a beautiful walk along the Seine. We did take a taxi there one night though as it was late. The are by the hotel is busy and if you leave your windows open at night it will be noisy but all the rooms have 2 sets of double panes on the doors and when closed you hear nothing. We enjoyed opening our windows during the day to hear everything below. The hotel staff are just A+. We arrived late at night and were greeted outside by several employees helping us to get to our rooms. Everyone who worked here was extremely polite and helpful. Thank god they all spoke english. The rooms are good size by Paris standards. Bathrooms are very nice. Our rate included breakfast which was awesome. Fresh squeezed juices, pastries, cereal, yogurts, fresh cut up fruit, eggs, bacon sausage, potatoes, veggies etc. Wonderful breakfast each morning. We also had a free boat ride on the Seine. The boats leave from Pont Neuf which is 5 minutes from the hotel. This was a wonderful cruise. We went early evening as it was cooler and less busy. The hotel provided us at a minimal charge, tickets to the Louve. We were able to walk right to the front to get in, this saved at least an hour or more in line. Thank god as it was very hot the day we went. Each morning we would stop at the front desk. Tell them where we were heading and they would draw on our maps the best routes, give us ideas for lunch, tips on the area etc. I really can't say enough about them. In the end I came down to 3 hotels to choose from. Relais Christine, Hotel Luxembourg Parc and d'Aubusson. We went to see the other 2 hotels as I was curious. Relais Christine is just around the corner. 30 seconds from d'Aubusson. This hotel is also beautiful. Gorgeous courtyard. The advantage to staying here is that it may be a little less busy as it is on a side street. We needed multiple rooms and the difference in price added up so that is why we didn't go here. Luxembourg Parc looked very nice but the location would not have been good for us. It is right by the Luxembourg gardens which are beautiful and worth a visit but it would take a good 15 minutes just to get to the Seine. The area also gets quite at night. After a long day sightseeing you don't want to have to walk back that far to your hotel. We loved d'Aubusson and would definitely return. There are also several other hotels on the same street and numerous within the area. some are cheaper but the area is the best.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful rooms, excellent location\u201d", "Author": "Alexanasta", "ReviewID": "UR116460539", "Content": "Loved this hotel!

I recommend the hotel. We had two rooms adjacent (but not adjoining) each other on the 3rd floor (floor #2, in European parlance). Our son had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153classic room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and we had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153superior\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room. Both rooms over looked the Rue Dauphine. Although the street is rather narrow and heavily trafficked during the day, two sets of double pane glass doors meant that street noise was never an issue. Both rooms had a small table with two comfortable chairs, as well as a desk with a chair. The beds were queen sized, and were comfortable. We had two windows (floor to ceiling double french doors each) and I was pleased with how bright the room was. Our son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room, which but one window, was somewhat darker. The bathroom had one sink and tub/shower combo. Amenities were my favorite \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Hermes green orange. Linens and towels were of high quality. There was plenty of storage space in a wall of closets in the entry foyer in each room. Lighting in the room was good. During our stay the A/C worked well, although it never truly cooled the room beyond comfortable. Since the weather was mostly in the 70\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or lower while we were there, it made me wonder how the air conditioning would do in truly hot weather. That said, I had no reason to complain. Breakfast was decent by the standards of French hotels. There were the standard hot options \u00e2\u20ac\u201c eggs, potatoes, bacon and so forth. And the fruit and bread selections were plentiful. What made the hotel stand out, by my standard, was how effective and efficient the front desk staff were. As I worked to plan our visit to Paris, I asked for help with dinner reservations. I always amazed that no matter when I emailed the hotel with a question or a request, the staff always got back to me within 20 or 30 minutes. The staff was equally impressive when I posed questions in person. Bravo. The only quibble I had with the hotel related to noise from the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Laurent, on the ground floor of the hotel. We were 2 floors above the Caf\u00c3\u00a9. In the evenings, there is live music. It was plainly evident in our son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room, and generally evident in our room in the evening. It kept our son up until the music stopped, somewhere around 12 midnight or thereafter. With the A/C fan set to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in our room, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice it as much, so it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t affect sleep. That said, if you are a light sleeper and go to bed before 1 am, I would certainly request a room away from the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Laurent side of the hotel.

The hotel also provides free DVD rentals, although the choices are somewhat limited. The hotel is in a wonderful location and many museums and other tourist sites are within easy walking distance. The Seine River is very close and there are a wide-variety of cafes, pizza shops and other dining options at your doorstep. There is a great pub right across the street named \"The Hideout\" if you want to grab a low-key, inexpensive drink at the end of the day.

I highly recommend booking one of the packages on the website.

My mother has an irrational fear of exchange rate fluctuations, so she insisted on booking through an unfamiliar website that allowed payment in advance in dollars. Luckily (#1) I called to confirm with the hotel the day before we left--that booking company had gone belly up and hadn't paid the D'Aubusson. Hard to explain the depth of my gratitude that the hotel had kept our reservation--though they had been assured that the website had contacted all of their customers, the hotel didn't trust them. Not only did they save our reservation, but they also offered us a package with MORE amenities at a slightly lower price. GOLD STAR! We were booked for a superior room, and I think this would be the one thing I would change about the stay. While the room was huge by European standards, the decor was quite drab. It wasn't the end of the world because when forced to stay inside, we used the public rooms of the hotel. The bed was ok-comfy. The bathroom was small but luxurious--WONDERFUL tub and one of the best showers I've ever had in a hotel. LOVED the Hermes toiletries. The breakfast room was lovely, and the buffet breakfast provided hot and cold items. It was perfect for a travelling breakfast, though get their early if you are very hungry! The jazz bar was a delight--there are a few regulars around but all were very friendly. The parlor is a joy as well... We were forced inside one afternoon when my mother was unwell and it was pouring down rain, but it was quite nice to sit by the fire and read or chat with other guests.

Back to the hotel itself: nice enough in overall feel but closer to what I'd consider a 3 star, not 4. Standard room was decent but pretty basic and bland in decor. Not noisy at all, although we overlooked Rue Dauphine. Breakfast was included for us but same thing everyday for a week got old. Front desk staff mixed bag: one girl gave me wrong metro train directions, one young man was sweet and tried hard but not super knowledgeable, one guy (early 30's?) offered valuable info re Versailles being closed on Mondays when he overheard me talking to the other guy about going there the next day, which allowed us to go on Sunday instead and saved us the aggravation of going all the way out there only to be disappointed/frustrated. No water one day when I wanted to shower at noon. I left the taps on and got water 10 mins. later. When inquired later, was told it was out for 45 minutes while being worked on. I realize it was an off time of day to shower, but if I'd been in a hurry, that would have been incredibly frustrating. Also, the water temp was preset to 38 degrees and was not hot enough and had weak pressure, while water from the hand-held head was nice and hot and strong pressure. A bit of a pain to have to use both in order to have a proper shower. Lastly, drain plug didn't work and the maid just pulled it out and left it on the sink after the first day when she saw that the tub wasn't draining. Weirdly enough, though the sheets didn't feel rough to the touch, they made loud paper-rustling sounds when moving around during night. No problem for the asleep one; slightly irritating for the one TRYING to fall asleep. Nice touch was that each day we got something different gratis: 1/2 bottle champagne, flowers, macaroons, fruit basket, jar of poached pears. And the usual chocolate covered almonds each night.

The hotel's lobby is elegant and inviting. The dining room, with its Aubusson rug where we enjoyed a complimentary daily breakfast of coffee, tea, hot chocolate, juices, hot foods, meats and cheeses, breads and pastries, fruit, cereals, yogurt, is cozy. There is outdoor seating, as well. We enjoyed coming home in the evenings(Wed. through Sat.) to listen to jazz in the hotel's Cafe Laurent, a well known musical venue. From the front desk staff and concierges to the doormen, Cafe Laurent and dining room staff to housekeeping, we experienced only warmth and kindness, and a genuine concern that guests have a wonderful stay. The location, in bustling St. Germain des Pres, a short walk from the Pont Neuf, the islands, the Louvre and Luxembourg Gardens, can't be beat. There are several metro stations, as well as a taxi stand, only blocks away. The area is full of restaurants, cafes, bistros, boulangeries and patisseries. With its charming interior and dedicated, first rate staff, Hotel d'Aubusson was truly a home away from home for us. Our stay there helped make our first(and hopefully not our last) trip to Paris a memorable one.", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "benezet", "ReviewID": "UR38394689", "Content": "We recently had a wonderful seven day stay at the Hotel d'Aubusson.

We have a nearly 14 year old and an 11 year old and this room was ideal with a queen size bed on the main level and a sofa lounge bed in the loft, and then a room off the loft area with a twin bed. We heard no noise from other rooms, which is always important. We had done the summer promotion so we got the free breakfast, which is much more than a continental breakfast but less than say a full American breakfast. The breakfast was very tasty and filling and a huge convenience just to quickly eat before out for the day. I would not, however, pay the 25 euros per person for the breakfast. My only complaint is similar to one made by another guest staying in a loft room--the room needs to have another air conditioning unit in the loft area.

We've travelled throughout US and North America, and have a good feeling for what we wanted. The problem with Paris hotels is often that they have small rooms and staff is not friendly. Nothing could be further from the truth at this hotel. The rooms are very reasonable in size. We paid a bit more, stayed on the top (5th) floor, in the Edith Piaf room. Very large, nice Queen bed, nice bathroom. Lots of light. Not a great view, but you don't stay in a hotel for the view. The staff is really, really nice. Always smiling. We speak French, but they speak English very well. The breakfast is wonderful: eggs, bacon, sausage, croissants, fresh-squeezed orange juice, etc... Every day there is a nice fire in a very large fireplace. Every time we got back to our room, there was a little treat: A bottle of champagne our first day. Chocolates our 2nd day. Tags for our bags the 3rd day. There is a very nice little bar downstairs, with Jazz on Thur-Sat nights. Think about it: sitting by the fire, sipping on a glass of wine, surfing my laptop (free WiFi) while a Jazz band plays 30-40 feet away. We saw many other hotels in this area, and I can't think of a better place to stay. The location is really the best. You can walk anywhere. There are great restaurants nearby (try Le Christine just 200 feet away). Fantastic place to stay. Can't see how anybody, even if you have crazy extravagant tastes, would be disappointed.", "Date": "December 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in Great Location\u201d", "Author": "i_luv_stj", "ReviewID": "UR20536360", "Content": "Stayed for a week in the Hotel d'Aubusson at the beginning of September and just loved it.

To be sure, you could rest your head at Le Meurice or Plaza Athen\u00c3\u00a9e and have every luxury at your disposal, but will every single member of staff greet you by name and tailor their service to your evey whim? Will a bottle of champagne with a hand-written concierge letter of genuine disappointment be waiting for you when a 3 Michelin star restaurant drops your dinner rsvp last-minute even though it is of no fault of the hotel whatsoever? And will your prized hotel have front desk personnel like Enzo, Jean, Audrey, and Frederic who will put various entertainment and dining options at your disposal without even asking? (As an example, my partner and I returned from dinner one night to be informed that, knowing we were often out late at night and probably interested in Paris's night scene, Jean had gone ahead and contacted some friends who owned one of the city's most luminous bars and that \"everything had been taken care of\"). And this is just about the service. The rooms themselves are a seamless mix of new and old: history abounds everywhere in this boutique jewel from the exposed beam chambres to the jazz bar frequented by some of Paris's greatest thinkers for more than two centuries; and yet when you're bathing in Hermes products and enjoying high definition television, it's hard to remember at times that you're away from home. The enchanting private courtyard flowing from the lobby spills into a stunning, original fireplaced family room adorned with accoutrements that remain true to the hotel's storied history wihout feeling stuffy. You can sense eveywhere you look in this property, and in everything you touch, that great thought and love has been put foward to making this the jewel of Paris.

I was there for almost two weeks and was extremely happy that I chose this charming, first rate hotel. All of the staff were exceptionally polite and helpful. I cannot remember any service I have experienced anywhere that was better than theirs. After I'd spoken with some of the staff more than once or twice, they had big smiles for me thereafter, something the French don't usually produce for total strangers. I had a \"superior\" room that I thought was very large by French standards for one person. I didn't book any special packages, but they had a lovely, large bouquet of Stargazer lilies in my room when I arrived. Every other night I received a gift in my room when I returned. A split of champagne, a giant brioche in their beautiful navy and gold box, a small fruit basket, a lovely jar of miniature pears in syrup, and eventually, a three drawer box of chocolates and other lovely candies. I don't know if they do this for guests who stay longer than a few days or what, but it was a wonderful surprise. I had planned my own itinerary, so I didn't need to bother the staff too much, but when I had a question, they were unfailingly polite and helpful. My room was always clean. And every night in addition to the candied orange bonbons and \"Good Night\" card they leave for everyone (in memory of Robespierre who often visited their establishment in the 1700s and ate oranges when they were a new fruit for France), they also leave another card with the name of the person who cleaned your room and the weather forcast for the next day. That forecast came in handy for me. My room was on the third floor in the corner, which is directly above the Cafe Laurent. I did notice some noise the first night, which was a Saturday, but I was eventually able to sleep anyway. After that weekend, I didn't notice any noise. The location is terrific for sightseeing and shopping. I was five minutes away from the Pont Neuf and Notre Dame, a great cheese shop, great bakery (one of many in the area), a well stocked little market, several good cafes and a ten minute walk from Patrick Roget's chocolate shop on the Boulevard Saint-Germain. It was about a 20 to 30 minute walk to the Louvre and the Musee D'Orsay. I had room service a few times (their pizza was excellent!) but did not eat other meals at the hotel. Their dining room, the eating area in the cafe and their beautful courtyard all seemed lovely to me. As a single woman traveling alone, I liked that the street was somewhat busy, but not overly so. The Relais Christine just down a side street was a little too isolated for me to have felt comfortable walking down their street at night--even if it was safe. The Rue de Buci, just down the street and around the corner was great for eating and people watching, but much busier day and night. If I ever have a chance to go back to Paris, I would want to return to Hotel d'Aubusson. It's a great little boutique hotel in a great location with a superior staff and it already feels like home to me.", "Date": "September 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palo Alto, California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay at the Hotel D'Aubusson!\u201d", "Author": "hopkinz", "ReviewID": "UR8864368", "Content": "My husband, 6 year old daughter and I stayed at the Hotel d'Aubusson July 1-5.

The hotel is perfectly situated within walking / metro distance from everything in Paris. I was a student in Paris 10 years ago, so I knew St. Germain was the ideal central location. If you can afford it, go for the Romance package. While I did not visit any of the standard rooms, when posts say the room with the romance package is \"big,\" that is by European standards. If one were paying $500 per night in the US, the square footage would certainly be doubled at the least. Regardless, the room looks exactly as pictured on the web site (though if my husband and I were given twin beds for the Romance package, as a previous post mentioned, I would have not been pleased -- good sleep with the Romance package?) The Hermes toiletries are truly fabulous. The shower / bathroom lovely, and the fresh flowers just perfect. The staff does a wonderful turndown, leaving little treats each evening (candies, pears, etc.), along with the forecast. The staff is delightful, helpful and multilingual. The airport pickup (or train station, in our case) was such a welcome relief to the planning process. Our champagne lunch in the courtyard was among our best lunch experiences in Paris. Other than the price, which one should expect for a European trip appeasing our American appetite for comfort (a/c, big rooms, etc), the main negatives at the hotel are truly minor. Those being: our room (210) was right by the kitchen. We are not early risers, so each morning, were were awakened by the sound of clattering dishes and the breakfast staff. Bottled water in the room is nearly 5 euro for .75 liters of Evian. (Though I probably would have dismissed this, except the hotel we just left in Amsterdam provided bottled water free of charge.) Also, the hotel bar is ridiculously expensive. 14 euro for a glass of champage? Nearly 18 euro for an after dinner coffee drink? It would be more appropriate to perhaps offer a discount to guests, plus, when the music begins, all tabs are subject to an additional charge. The dvd rental is also not free. These are 9 euro, and one has to go down to the desk to rent the dvd, or request room service (requiring a tip), so that's 15 USD. In all, the negatives are truly minior nit-picky things. We would still, most likely return to the hotel because of the location. And I would probably book the romance package again, as it is a better rate for the room category than what is published as the stand rate, yet it includes so much.

This was most easily seen in the barely functional bathroom fixtures - shower fixtures barely worked in both of our rooms, sinks had minimal water pressure. I got the feeling that the fixtures haven't been really looked at, and certainly not replaced, since the hotel opened several decades ago.

This hotel made Paris everything that I dreamed it could be. Although the weather was a bit cold and a bit rainy (we had one clear day in the 4 days we were there), the hotel made it that much easier. Staying in the Latin Quarter is an absolute must in Paris. There were literally 30 or 40 restaurants/cafes/bistro within a 5 minute walk of the hotel, all of an excellent standard (contact us for recommendations if you like). The hotel is also 5 minutes walk from 2 metro stations, Place St Michel and Odeon (St Michel is closer) so getting around is a breeze (buy a Paris Visite card if travelling on a budget for unlimited public transport). The best thing about the hotel location is you are 100m from Pnt Neuf, and onyl 10 minutes walk to the Louvre. If you book the romance package, Louvre tickets are included which made a big difference. The room is spacious, the bed is dreamy comfortable and the bathroom was huge! We stayed on the romance package which is one of their large rooms. If you are coming here for romance, find the money to stay at this hotel, I cannot tell you how good it is.

If you've checked the map, you'll see how perfectly located it is, in Latin Quarter almost St. Germaine. Pont Neuf, connecting the nearby Louvre, Marais etc, is only two short blocks away. There are tons of restaurants and shops within a few blocks. It's so centrally located that we only used the metro once- we walked everywhere. The hotel is on Rue Dauphine, which is a nice street with an interesting mix of shops. The neighborhood is great for strolling- cafes, pastries, and a great little counterculture book/comic shop down the block called Librairie Actualit\u00c3\u00a9s. Continuing down gets you to the Buci area, which is always jumping. A few more blocks and you're at Le Deux Magots, Cafe De Flor, and Brasserie Lipp. Go the other way and you're on the bridge admiring the Eiffel tower as you head to the right bank. The hotel feels classy and elegant from the time you come into the lobby, and the Cafe Laurent is a fine bar to have a drink or snack, or listen to some great jazz. There are two internet computers, one in the cafe and right on the street so you can surf and people watch at the same time. Our room was initially the Edith Piaf room, 507, I think. We were on the well discounted Romance package, as it was my wife's 50th birthday and our anniversary. The room was large and well appointed. However, we suddenly realized that some of our favorite times while in hotels abroad were when we could throw open the windows and see the streetscape. 507 is well removed from the street, and very quiet. We felt isolated, and debated whether to complain that the room was *too* quiet! Finally we called and they were fine with showing us another Deluxe, and comparable, room. The next one was about the same, and by now we were feeling pretty guilty, but the reception clerk, Jenny, was extremely gracious. As we came around to realizing what we wanted, and were almost resigned to a big quiet room (!), we explained to her, she made a call, and showed us a Superior room, just a notch down in size. It was room 204 and it was perfect. We walked in and there were two French doors that had two windows behind them with a tiny 'balcony' (not really, just a foot or two of landing and a rail). Finding just what we wanted, we threw open the windows and enjoyed the bustle of the street. It was like sitting at a cafe peoplewatching. Not to worry, the two sets of windows with the air gap were virtually hermetically sealed when closed, and you cannot hear a thing. For us, 201-204 are the best of both worlds, quiet plus a little street action, and we were fine with a slightly smaller room. The staff couldnt' have been more helpful. They were always smiling, accommodated every request graciously. A distinctive mark of an excellent hotel (or organization), is how they deal with challenges. D'Aubusson rose to it by showing us several rooms and finding what we wanted. Additionally, when a mistake was made with the laundry service, they made good on it the only way possible, by paying for the pants. No argument, no explanation, just a sincere apology and a generous credit. The bartender at Cafe Laurent (Flavienne I believe) is fun to hang out with, and the place has its own following. Use the staff for recommendations. They know the area. Avoid the restaurant row nearby where the hawkers practically steer you into their establishments, and either scope out a place in advance, or tell the staff your preferences. Be careful scoping in advance, as there's a big difference in some latin quarter streets for ambience in dining between daytime and night. The staff arranged our Romance Package amenities very well- Louvre tickets, Seine boat cruise, classical concert, car pickup, and of course the champagne, fruit, brioche, and gift. They also got us anniversary lunch reservations at Jules Verne in the Eiffel Tower, which until the next day was the best meal we'd ever had. They also arranged our anniversary dinner the next day at a restaurant a block away called Jacques Cagna. We had no idea if the staff was good at picking special restaurants, and wowwwwww. It was spectactular, and the perfect special occasion place. We enjoy quality gourmet restaurants occasionally, and this place topped our top places in San Francisco and Italy. Thank god we took out the second mortgage on the house! But sometimes, you do something off the charts and it leaves an indelible memory for life, which is exactly why you splurged. Breakfast at the hotel was excellent. Yes a bit pricey but what a spread; and we didn't care since it was included in the rate. The breakfast room is lovely, there's another room next to it if you want to move around, and in good weather, there's a courtyard for breakfast or drinks and snacks. The kitchen staff will make any breakfast dish you request, so if continental isnt' your style, have it your way. We typically use Tripadvisor to find hotels. We look for the highest ranking hotel within our criteria, which is usually at least 3 star, dead center location, not ridiculously expensive, and no recent Tripadvisor comments about lack of cleanliness. We tend to throw out the best and worst reviews, chalking them off to people that love everything or people with 'travel issues', respectively. Curious about our hotel choice, we went around the corner and checked out Relais Christine, which our hotel advised us is a friend of theirs, not so much a rival. Relais Christine had some beautiful features, such as the spa and charming cavelike dining arear. A few rooms even had a patio. However, all in all, we preferred D'Aubusson's location on a more interesting street, the Cafe, and our room furnishings. It was a great experience at the D'Aubusson, and deserves its very high Tripadvisor marks.", "Date": "September 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cD'Aubusson is Charming and Hospitable\u201d", "Author": "LyonDuck", "ReviewID": "UR5794461", "Content": "We booked two standard rooms at the Hotel D'Aubusson the last week of August, (room numbers 201 and 202).

I have also stayed at other Parisian hotels like the Regina and the Hotel Lutettia and wasn't all that impressed. The location near Odeon could not be better. You are in the heart of the latin quarter and only a couple of blocks from Pont Neuf bridge. There are restaurants galore around you ,including L'Entrecote St Germain, which the kids loved. The Hotel D'Aubusson provides a clean, quiet hotel room with a fantastic staff. Our Summer Promotion package included airport pickup, breakfast and various vouchers for the Louvre and Seine cruises. Our driver was waiting for us as we got through crazy baggage claim area of CDG. The hotel provided gifts and turn down service at night. Laurent, the jazz bar located off the lobby is a nice place to hang out and catch emails through wifi. The breakfast includes a wide assortment of cheeses, eggs, breads, fruits, cereals etc. Even though it was included in our package, I still think it would be worth paying 15 to 20 euros for. If you want a big American style hotel, go to the right bank and run with the masses. If you want intimate type stay where the clerks wave and acknowledge you (in building that dates back to the 1600's), check the D'Aubusson.

It was really a 4 star hotel in our opinion, where I can see that some would rate this hotel as a 3 star everyone is different.

Don't expect over the top luxury epecially if you are used to staying at the 4 seasons etc. We stayed for 10 days and loved it so much and loved Paris so much we booked another week for this september and we are bringing more family members so we are booking 3 rooms the next time.

Winter promotion rates where $1 = 1 Euro, including breakfast, 1 day museum pass, champagne, and other amenities make things a bit more affordable.

The street runs right into the Pont Neuf, but for the most part we heard almost no street noise whatsoever. Our room was #406, one of the larger rooms, with 2 beds together, probably in total the width of an American King but shorter.... As we are both over 6' tall, they were definitely too short and this was an annoyance. The mattresses are typically Parisian.. hard... but the linens are very high-quality.
