Great value - the cheapest hotel we could find in the area! We stayed in room 14 which was fine, I'd maybe ask for a room higher up as each night we could hear the hoover (?) in reception. Shower was great, safe in room was useful and bed was comfy. Only issue was the hairdryer, which for someone with thick/long hair, was useless, and reception didn't have another to lend us. Receptionists were always friendly although not too over the top. We didn't try the breakfast, went to a little cafe round the corner and made friends with the owner.

Rue Thenard is quiet, but very central. Easily accessed via RER from Paris CDG airport (get off at Saint Michel-Notre Dame) and walk via the underground connection to Cluny - La Sorbonne station and exit (sortie) on Bd St. Germain on the Musee de Cluny side. It's easier this way than coming overground at St Michel and having to dodge traffic, pedestrians and lights with your luggage. Walk east on Bd. St. Germain, cross rue St. Jacques take the next turn right onto Rue Thenard. The hotel is 75 metres up on the left, opposite the Pre Verre restaurant (excellent value and good food - very handy!). The lift goes to the fifth floor (don't get a room on the 6th). We had room 52 (with balcony) a little tight for space (no chest of drawers). Bed was very comfortable. Decor a little faded but the hotel is clean and the room was scrupulously maintained during our stay. Bathroom very adequate with excellent shower and constant hot water. Breakfast was not included. Best breakfast locally is at the Brasserie Balzar at 49 rue des Ecoles about 150 metres away. \u20ac6 for glass of fresh orange juice, coffee, croissant and half baguette, butter and jam/marmalade. Main sights are all easily accessible. Notre Dame, Saint Chapelle, Musee de Cluny, Eglise St. Severin, Eglise St Etienne du Mont, the Pantheon, St Sulpice and St Germain des Pres are all walkable. From the same St Michel - Notre Dame station take the RER C5 (direction Versailles Rive Gauche) for Musee d'Orsay, Eiffel Tower and Versailles itself. (beware there are other Versailles directions, make sure you are going to Versailles Rive Gauche). Staff are pleasant and helpful and all the receptionists have good english. My only quibble was that the computer provided in the reception area does not have a printer attached. This means you have to email your online check-in page (once you have accessed it) to the receptionist's computer (which has a printer). This is unnecessarily fiddly and not easy unless you are good with computers (I am not). I had to get the receptionist to do it for me.

It is easy to find, and very easy to navigate the city from this area(using the metro and walking). Convenient the RER B line from the airport. Overall- 5 For the value, location, and comfort level.

However the most endearing part of our stay was the staff at the hotel who were extremely helpful and pleasant. One person who should be singled out is Mr. Santana the front desk manager who was always smiling and quick with advice on how to use the Mero to get to other great sights in Paris such as Montmartre.

It says it is a two star, but the rating system really is different than the US. I'd give it a three star based on the quality. The hotel staff was always courteous and eager to help(not to mention didn't mind speaking English with us), we got a great restaurant suggestion for our last night in the city by a staff member and it was fabulous. Our rooms were small (this is to be expected in Paris), but it was well kept and clean, and the bathroom had a tub and shower which was nice. The beds were pretty comfortable, we didn't have a problem falling asleep or hurting the next morning. It is in close proximity to all the major attractions, we even walked to the Eiffel tower, although this was a stretch even for us, our feet were nearly numb afterward! It is located on a (more quiet) street, though it is next door to the Latin Quarter. The only slight issue I would mention is the fact that you are required to be back to the hotel by midnight, which wasn't a huge deal to us (exhausted after our long days), but it may be for other guests.

I'm happy to report that we were absolutely charmed by the Latin Quarter and the Hotel du College de France. It is a wonderful, reasonably-priced option if you want to stay in this part of the city and we found it very convenient to Notre Dame, Luxembourg Gardens, the fascinating Cluny Museum, the Pantheon (sadly closed for renovation while we were there) and Sainte Chapelle. We also walked from our hotel to the Orsay, Orangerie, and Louvre, which took about 20-25 minutes, although next time I would recommend taking the metro. There are several convenient metro stops, including the huge St. Michel/Notre Dame station which minimizes transfers and also puts you conveniently on the RER B line for the airports. There are a number of grocery stores nearby (we actually didn't find the closest one until our last day there, but it didn't matter), several restaurants and cafes, and also some McDonalds and Starbucks for those needing a taste of Americana. The area felt very safe, although there is a lot of traffic as one might expect. The hotel itself is quite charming, with a small sitting area in the lobby and a small breakfast nook. The breakfast is a reasonable-for-Paris-hotels 10 euro, although we never took advantage of it so have no comments as to its quality. There is a (small) elevator which goes up to the 5th floor. Our room was on the 6th. To access the rooms on the 6th floor, one must ascend and descend a spiral staircase, and the room itself is a bit attic-like with a sloping ceiling. If this is an issue for you, be sure to request a room on a different floor. Being on the top floor, we had a small view of the city which actually included the Eiffel Tower, visible through a gap in the buildings. There are several windows so the room is bright and airy, and the lights are controlled by slotting your key into the wall to turn on the electricity - not uncommon in European hotels. Nearly all hotel rooms in Paris are small, it must be said, but we thought ours was an acceptable size and furnished smartly for maximum effect. The tub/shower was high, and so one must be careful getting in and out, but the bathroom was otherwise fine and very clean. There is a notebook in the room which provides information on local sights, restaurants, markets, etc., and the code for the free wi-fi which was a bit slow but very reliable and useful. There is also a laptop downstairs, amusingly tucked into an old-style phone booth, for guest's use and the staff was very accommodating about printing your boarding passes. Indeed, we found the hotel staff to be extremely helpful and kind. The daytime clerk patiently made restaurant reservations for us one night, despite difficulties in communicating with the restaurant's hostess who didn't speak French. The night clerk was extremely friendly (and cute!) and was the one who helped us with our boarding passes and made us feel as if we were friends he was happy to help, rather than guests who were imposing. I typically prefer to stay in different areas when visiting a city multiple times, and so rarely stay in the same hotel twice, even when I liked the experience. However, I felt so comfortable and welcome here at Hotel du College de France, and felt that it was such a great value for the money, that I would be hard-pressed to want to stay anywhere else.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mansfield, UK", "Title": "\u201cAnother great stay\u201d", "Author": "KnD.Moore", "ReviewID": "UR104543618", "Content": "We spent 4 nights at the Hotel du College de France for my wife's birthday.

You may be able to get cheaper elsewhere outside the hotel, but we enjoyed the selection of fresh fruit salad, orange juice, croissants, pain au chocolate, bread, cheeses, ham, cereals and yoghurts.

At the same time, it's on a quiet street and not crammed into the noisier parts of the quarter. Second, the room was comfortable. Small, but who cares if you're out for most of the day. The bed was comfy, the room was clean, it had a safe and a TV, and our third floor room had tons of sunlight. As a downside, the walls are a little thin so you can sometimes hear other guests at night.

The Metro and bus stops were very close, I had forgotten the scale of the Paris maps! The location is very quiet, just off the Boulevard St. Germain in the Latin Quarter. We booked this Hotel because of the excellent reviews and we intended to be out for most of the day and evening, and did not need larger rooms or more facilities. We wanted to do as much walking as possible to visit the main sights close to the Hotel. This was very easy, despite the very cold weather. We found a couple of excellent Restaurants very close by, and opted for the A la Carte, rather that the Fixed Price Menus that were all very similar in the small pedestrian streets. Paris Hotel rooms in this price range are small, we have stayed in smaller! We booked a room on the 6th floor with twin beds, and no Balcony. It was one of the most expensive at 125 Euros a night, which we thought was fair. It was very clean, warm, and had a small Bath with shower. There is no lift to the top floor, the tiny lift only goes to the 5th floor, and then there is a circular staircase with an automatic lighting system that comes on when you trigger the sensor by going up the stairs. If you have mobility issues or are claustrophobic, then beware of the lift and the stairs. We had Breakfast every day there. The Dining Room is very small with seats squashed around very small tables. You can have Breakfast brought up to your room if you wish, a nice idea. However, the Hotel was quiet when we were there, so we ate downstairs. I had no intention of wandering around finding something cheaper than 10 Euros. You could eat as much as you wanted from Cereal, Cheese, Ham, good-quality Jams, Bread, Croissants, Pain au Chocolat, and Tea Coffee, and Herbal Teas. Drinks out were often at least 3-4 Euros, except from a roadside stall with a takeaway cup. Tea and Coffee was available from Reception 24 hours, for a small fee, as were beer and soft drinks from the fridge. Staff were helpful, and an Apple Mac was available free in the Phone Cubicle. My only negative comment would be that the landing corridors are rather shabby and somewhat neglected. The Lobby, small Lounge with TV, and Dining Roome have been nicely re-furbished. Our room was nice too. Reservation was very efficient, and my queries were dealt with very quickly. I looked at a local Best Western nearby, and it was more than 200 Euros a night.

We bought Carnet Tickets and pre-booked Museum tickets in the UK. It certainly saved a lot of time, and meant we could just get out and go! The ticket to Versailles bought from the Chateau on-line was excellent value, and we bought tickets that also included seeing the Dressage Practice Show in the Versailles Stables.

The room and bathroom (with shower) are definitely small, but not as small as other budget rooms (namely compared to those in the Rick Steves-recommended hotels in the Rue Cler area... you know which ones I mean). The room was clean, comfortable and had two doors to the balcony, which contained a small table and two chairs. There was a closet with mirrored doors, and a desk with chair and stool. There was free and convenient Wi-Fi in the room, as well as a computer for internet access on the ground floor. The carpet was a bit worn, but that is the only complaint I MIGHT have. Otherwise, the room and hotel overall were VERY clean. To top it off, the service was warm and friendly, something I have not experienced in other affordable hotels in Paris. (And I say this with the utmost respect for Parisians; I know they have hard exteriors, but are truly nice underneath.) Day reception, in particular, was exceptionally helpful and pleasant, as were the cleaning staff and the woman who worked the breakfast buffet. The Hotel du College de France's Left Bank location puts it very near the Sorbonne, Luxembourg Gardens and Notre Dame, as well as making it an affordable alternative location to Right Bank walking distance visits to the Louvre and Rue Saint-Honore shopping.

Since we had less than two days in Paris I was looking for a location that would allow us to make the best of our time there. This was perfect. We arrived very early and checked out early the next day and the staff was very tolerant of the enormous amount of our luggage in their little office. The room itself was pleasant and the bathroom well renovated, shiney and roomy. The price of the room was quite reasonable but I think 20 Euros for a roll away was a bit much especially since it was of a poor quality and came apart. I did not tell the hotel about it until the next day and they immediately made note. Had I asked I have no doubt they would have changed it. The room was very crowded with 7 pieces of lugguage but we managed somehow. For two people with less luggage the room size would have been quite acceptable. I do appreciate them allowing us to even have the roll away as some places would have forced us to take a second or more expensive room. For one night, just to sleep it was quite sufficient. I regret not taking their breakfast for 10 Euros. The breakfast prices in the immediate surroundings were not much less and the convenience, time saved, and likely quality would have been worth it. In the evening due to jet lag we made an unfortunate choice in restaurants on nearby St Germaine called something like 24/7. The next day on our way to the walking tour we discovered a huge number of nice looking restaurants in the area of Saint Michel including Chez Clement a chain which we enjoyed a branch of last year near the Opera. So do your homework restaurant wise there is more than enough to choose from. I would return with pleasure!!! Thank you Mr. Sadr for all your help.

Once we returned, we were told that we had been upgraded from the double balcony room we had booked to the room with the Eiffel Tower view (room 63). To get to this room, you need to take the elevator up to floor 5 and take the stairs to floor six. We were pleasantly surprised with our room. It was very spacious with a wrap around balcony. A small table and chairs were set up in the area where the Eiffel Tower could be seen. It was a great place to sit, especially in the evening to watch the tower lit up. Although this was a really nice room to have with the upgrade, I would think twice about paying extra for this room since the Eiffel Tower is such pretty far away. If space is worth it to you, it may be worth the extra money. It was a nice touch that they included a binder with information on both the hotel and surrounding area (bakeries, wine shops, etc.). The free wifi worked fine in our room. The bathroom was also spacious and clean. Breakfast was 10 euro. We paid for this on two mornings because of the ease. One morning we did try to find something in the area that would be quick for breakfast, but after leaving the hotel, nothing was open other than sit-down cafes (8:00am). The subway location (St. Michel/Notre Dame) was great because it didn't require transferring to get to Gard du Nord (high speed train), Versailles, Orsay, and the Eiffel Tower.

There is a small table with two chairs that we enjoyed using for an evening meal. Because it was cool we brought the table inside the room, used a towel as a tablecloth and opened the windows to enjoy the view. It was charming! If you like to pick up a baguette, wine, fruit, cheese, and food, everything is conveniently available at Place Maubert.

Chose this hotel after reading the positive reviews on websites googled and also those on tripadvisor. It's pretty much everything you'll read in the other reviews. We actually stayed in two different rooms which included the normal double room and also probably the best room in the hotel on the top floor (with the balcony and view of the Eiffel Tower). First thing to mention is that this is a hotel for those working within a budget. Paris is ridiculously expensive and you'll expect to pay double what you would pay in other cities around Europe. If you got the dough, you should probably stay somewhere else. I paid around 150 euros per night for the best room here. Got offered the No. 1 hotel on tripadvisor (Jays) for 250 Euros. If I had it, I would have paid the extra for what looks a beautiful hotel and rooms. But if you're an average earner like myself then I would say look no further! Getting there- Straight forward. We just grabbed the RER (train) from Charles de Gaulle airport, stopped at St Michel and walked the five minutes to hotel. Easy peasy. Location - Perfect! Right next to the Latin Quarter with plenty of restaurants, shops, bars etc. Lovely for an evening stroll etc. You are right next to Notre Dame Cathedral. Few minutes walk only. And yes, it is located on a quiet street yet so close to all the action. Walking distance from the main shopping area around the Pompidou Centre also. Price - very reasonable. I spent loads of time looking into alternatives and am satisfied this was an excellent deal. Rooms - First room we stayed in was a double with balcony on fifth floor. Pokey and small but clean. The second room we stayed in was room 62. Top floor. More spacious....satisfying more spacious and has a view of Eiffel Tower. The view is minimal and can only be seen from the balcony but fits the purpose of the old romantic idea of staying in a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower. Also had a bath and some matresses there that could be pulled out and used if there was more than two of you. Other info you should know- the lift is tiny so if you're a big boned person, to put it politely, then you'll find it a squeeze. We paid for the breakfast which I was satisfied with. Croissants, pain au chocolat, baguettes with ham and cheese, fruit salad, yoghurts, orange juice, generous jug of coffee or tea. Good enough to set you up for the day. Noticed some other female guest being sneaky and making some sandwiches which she wrapped up and took up to the bedroom before coming down again and having her breakfast. Obviously a means of a cheap lunch and not having to fork out the stupid prices they want in the cafes/restaurants. Paid twenty euros for a couple of crap crepes and coffees on the champs elysees to give you and indication of what to expect. The staff were all very nice and helpful too. Completely happy there too.

My mother and 18 year old niece were in a twin on the 2nd floor, no balcony. The rooms were very small, but it didn't really matter since we were in Paris to see the city and were there only to sleep. The balcony room was a nice bonus, though. We went to a local market and picked up some wine, cheese, and bread and sat out on the balcony in the evening. It was wonderful. Front desk staff was pleasant and helpful, providing directions, etc. The hotel had a certain charm about it and we enjoyed our stay. Everything was clean and in working order. The housekeeping staff was very friendly and pleasant. There is free wi-fi in the lobby. They serve European breakfast in the morning but it is pretty expensive at 10 euros per person, unless you are really, really hungry! The balcony had a small table with 2 chairs and there were 2 sets of french doors opening onto it. Plenty of ventilation, and there was also a ceiling fan. It was very hot weather on our visit, but we kept cool and comfortable at night, even without air conditioning. Very small, slow elevator, but no big deal to pop up and down the stairs (when you don't have suitcases). If you are used to staying at the Ritz, this is not the hotel for you. We took the train from London to Gare du Nord, and from there we caught an RER train, rode it for 2 stops, and walked 3 short blocks to the hotel. Pretty easy, except for the hassles of buying tickets at Gare du Nord. My advice on that is to bring exact change or an ATM card so you can find a ticket vending machine that works (sort of) to buy tickets. We found an awesome little bistro (Bistrot Le Saint Jacques, 71 rue St. Jacques) around the corner that specializes in Parisian food. In particular, galettes, which are thin buckwheat crepes grilled and filled with your choice of fillings. We had ham & cheese. Yum! It is a family owned and run business. The proprietor, Marc, was so gracious and welcoming. We met his wife, and sons. Even though we don't speak French, we communicated in a common language, Spanish! We felt like family members and we got to experience the \"real\" Paris. Unforgettable.

The hotel was located near so many sites - Notre Dame, City Hall, the Senate, Luxembourg Gardens, and within walking distance of the Louvre. It was also near metro stops and a train stop. Not to mention there were tons of restaurants nearby. Just ask the front desk where to go or walk around near Notre Dame for fast food type of stuff. The rooms were small, but not so small as to be a nuisance. They were very clean - no problems there whatsoever. There was enough room to not be tripping over your suitcases all week. (We stayed in two different rooms since we left mid-week for Normandy. They even let us leave behind one of our suitcases while we travelled! I was nervous but nothing went missing, etc.) We skipped the breakfast at the hotel. I believe it was 10 euros per person and we knew we could beat that price. One day we had a full breakfast for 18 euros and every other day we grabbed croissants & coffee for around 7 euros total. The hotel had free computer access, which came in very handy. It's located inside a little booth, so not the best set-up, but really no problem. It was a great help. They also posted the forecast every day. No real complaints about the staff.

' 08. We reserved our first 4 nights in the city at this hotel at the same time. Our decision was based on the many favourable reviews noticed on Tripadviser. We were not disappointed -- in fact we were surprised and \"over-pleased\", if you could imagine. The Hotel du College de France is a very clean, affordable, friendly hotel in a very convenient location to discover the centre of Paris. What more could the average tourist ask for ?! Once there, we asked for a reservation for our last 3 days in France prior to flying home a month later. At first there was no room -- we were approached later by staff to say there was a last minute cancellation for only 1 of the nights we wanted. We grabbed it without hesitation. So my point is, the secret is obviously out about this place. Book well in advance to avoid disappointment. The staff is great. Whenever we approached them with whatever request we had, it NEVER seemed to be a bother to satisfy us. All the top floor rooms had a little balcony & table it appeared. We were assigned room #23 which was the only lower room with a balcony setup and it was delightful. We often brought back store -bought food and drink to dine on our balcony. The store is very handy just down the block to St. Germain, cross the street then a quick left I best recall. There's also a 'pub-like' restareunt at that corner . It's one of the few places in France we could find to go for a ham & egg breakfast if you prefer that in the morning. If you are a strong walker you can reach most popular city attractions by foot from the hotel. There are other attractions that will require public transit use. The subway system is handy and efficient. The larger stations though are hectic and a little dis-orienting.

My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel all three (3) days we were in Paris, and it was great. The website offers great directions on how to get there from the airport, etc. LOCATION: This hotel's location is perfect--we were about a block away from two metro stops, a block away from the hustle and bustle of the latin district dining and shopping, two blocks from the Notre Dame, and two blocks from The Pantheon. We were able to take the metro or walk to all our Parisian destinations. The hotel is located on a quiet street, comparably. THE ROOM: The room was great--a double bed, TV, fan, bathroom & shower in the room, and french doors leading to a balcony. We stayed on the 5th floor, which offered beautiful views of a church and other nearby buildings. My favorite day was when we came back to the room, mid-day, and opened the balcony doors, let the sunlight and autumn breeses in, and took a nice nap. (-) The walls are thin, and we could hear the people in the room next to us, but it wasn't a big deal as our neighbors were not loud. BREAKFAST: We had the option of having breakfast on the first floor in the hotel, for 8 Euros each, each day. Breakfast was convenient and nice--consisted of choice of Coffee, Tea, or Hot Chocolate. Cereal, milk, fruit, yogurt, croissants, bread & cheese. (-) There are hotel rooms on the first floor. These rooms are right next to where people are eating breakfast, which might be loud for those guests staying in these 1st floor rooms. I would suggest requesting a room on any other floor, unless you're an early riser. HOTEL STAFF: Hotel staff, including front desk clerks, house-keeping, and one of two breakfast servers, were all very pleasant, smiling, and positive.

I don't bring my laptop to Europe so no comments about WIFI, but it is available. Didn't eat breakfast-10 euros looked like a lot for what was offered. We probably would have eaten there, but we slept in late the first morning after arriving late and finishing dinner at La Harpe after midnight and we left for the airport the second morning where we had access to the Air France Salon which provided complimentary breakfast and cocktails/champagne. HCF is a definite 5 rating on Trip Advisor for Paris. Unless you're looking for the Georges V or similar or need to stay in a different part of Paris, look no further. I can't imagine anything better on the left bank. Room #42-2 very comfortable, twin beds, free safe, flat screen TV, multi-speed fan with 2 windows opening onto Rue Thenard-might be problem if very, very hot outside but would have to be over 30C/86F at night, I think. How often does that happen in Paris? Noise not an issue when we were there. Extra outlets, if needed, near bed and elsewhere. They have those nasty long, round pillows, but there are good, normal, fluffly ones in the closet-so no pillow issue. Bathroom-best one I've ever had in Paris (I've stayed in many hotels, mostly 2* and 3*) Tub with shower (yes it has a half glass door, but if properly closed by lining up with side of tub and not bumping into while showering, no splatter issue) As in all Paris bathtubs, the side is steeper than the tubs in the US so you have to lift your legs higher. I get tired of hearing people complain about the half glass door and higher side on the tub! Bidet (didn't use), toilet, and sink. Some toiletries provided. Clean towels and restocked toiletries the 2nd day as well-not sure about sheets since I usually just sleep under top cover or duvet. Extras: -we arrived late the first night (at 10 pm), but everything was ready and waiting for us even though the hotel was full (complet) I had emailed the hotel to expect us around 9 pm, but our flight from Vienna was an hour late. Bottom line, they were honest and professional and had saved a quiet room with 2 beds as I had requested. -received wake up call as requested on morning of checkout -younger guy at front desk called Restaurant Le Buffet, Rue des Trois Freres, in Montmartre for me the see if they were open on a Monday evening-they had been closed in the early afternoon when I walked by. Their hours are \"at their discretion and convenience, they will be open\" but food-except for the green pepper sauce-and service is great if you speak some French.

They had a lift to the 5th fool then you had to walk 1 flight of stairs. No problem at all. It was a nice size with a small TV and a desk. The room also had a safe which is great when traveling with your passports. Bed Bed was ok. I can't say I ever woke up with a stiff back so it served it purpose for 4 nights. Bathroom Equipped and stocked daily. They did have soap and shampoo to use. Shower/Tub This was a mess. They had a small tub with a handheld shower head. The tub was too short to put your legs out straight. The holder for the shower head was only at waist level when standing, no higher. Needless to say the bathroom would be covered in water when you were done, whether you sat or stood. There was one morning where the hot water took a little while but after it came it didn't run out. TV They had a small TV in the room. We got 3 English news channels. BBC, CNN and SkyNews. Breakfast We skipped it because it was 10 euros and it didn't really look worth it at all. Checkout No problems here either. We checked right out and were on our way. We were billed the correct amount when we got home. Internet Computer They had a computer setup to check email which was very helpful. Area around the hotel There are a lot of choices of places to eat within a few blocks, mostly sandwich or crepe shops. A lot of tourist places so fixed price menus and higher prices. The RER and subway are also pretty close, there are three locations to choose from. If you had to walk to the Louvre its really not that far, maybe 30 minutes or so. 10 minutes to Notre Dame.

Firstly, it's very cramped. The lobby is very small, and the lift can only fit 1 person with a suitcase. Most of the time we used the staircase with its nuisance automatic lighting system that turned on too late. The lock/key system is difficult to use the first few times (the cleaning lady had to show us) and since the room electricity is controlled by the key, that was a further annoyance.

They eventually arranged a limousine (expensive, but worth it). The location is excellent - close to the metro and the RER to/from the airport (if it is running). A word of caution - you cannot get on or off the RER at either end without climbing up and/or down stairs, so guide yourself accordingly based on the number and weight of suitcases.

My wife and I stayed there for 5 nights last month, and were completely satisfied. It is a charming, small, family run hotel. The owner, Mr. Marc was at the front desk nearly every day. So was Mr. Sadr, who has worked at the hotel for many tears. It was nice to see the people from their website actually working there. We stayed in Room 25, which is a basic room with one double bed. The furnishings aren't antique, but they were functional. The bathroom was good sized by European standards, modern and very clean, we had a bath/shower combo, which had excellent water pressure and temperature. The window in the bath had transparent contact paper that looked like a Stained Glass window. The room also had a flat screen TV and a 5 speed fan. The fan is operated by a white box alongside the bed. It came in handy on a couple of warm nights. We had a nice view down Rue de Latran from our room. Free Wi-Fi Internet is available in every room as well. We brought our PDA and it worked just fine to check our e-mail. One odd feature about the rooms at the Hotel du College de France is that your room key is also used to turn the lights on in your room. There is a credit card type thing attached to the key, and you insert it into the slot on the wall to power up your room. I guess this saves electricity since you can't leave the lights on when you leave the room. The Hotel also follows the standard European practice of leaving the room key at the front desk when you go out for the day. There is a nice little sitting area just off the front desk area. It is stocked with numreous travel books about Paris and France. There is also a laptop computer in the old phone booth that can be used to check your e-mail as well. There is a spiral staircase that is decorated in the Half Timber style. You can also take a tiny, tiny elevator. Two people can barely fit in the lift. When we checked in, there wasn't room for both of us and our luggage. My wife went up with the suitcases. I walked up the spiral staircase. The breakfast room is small, but adaquate for the number of guests at the hotel. It has the typical French hotel items: croissants, bagette bread, sliced ham, assorted cheeses, yogurt and 2 types of cereal. There is also orange juice and cold milk on the buffet. When you first sit down, the server will ask if you want coffee or tea. They will also ask for your room number, so you can be charged the 8 Euro per person fee for the breakfast. This is a normal practice in France. We had breakfast at the Hotel every morning. It was a good, all you can eat spread. We didn't have to hunt for breakfast somewhere else. The location of the Hotel is excellent as well. It is well situated in the Left Bank, in the Latin Quarter. Blvd. Saint Germain is a short block away. It has numerous cafes and restaurants. Most of them are to the left when you get to the Boulevard. However, if you go to the right, it is a very short walk to Place Maubert, which is a charming Parisian Square with a nice selection of cafes. Also at Place Maubert in one of the 2 nearby Metro stations. The other is to the left on St. Germain at Cluny. There is also excellent bus service. Eastbound busses travel on Blvd. St. Germain...westbound busses (towards the Eiffel Tower) travel down Rue des Ecoles, one block south. It is also very easy to get to the Hotel from CDG Airport. We took an express train, RER B, directly from Terminal 2 to St. Michel station. It was a short walk to the hotel from there. Speaking of walking, there are many sites within walking distance from the Hotel. Ile de la Cite and Notre Dame are about 5 minutes away. The Cluny Museum is even closer. The restaurants on Rue de la Harpe are also very close. The Pantheon and the Louvre are walkable too, but a bit further...about 15 minutes. Plus, the hotel is located in a very nice part of the Left Bank, so just going out and wandering the nearby streets can be a rewarding experience. In closing, I highly recommend the Hotel du College de France. It is a quaint, traditional Parisian hotel in a terrific neighborhood.

The decor is quite subdued and on what I assume to be a heraldic theme with statues of knights etc., , to echo the College de France at the end of the street - we thought the stairs looked a bit shabby when we arrived, but it turned out they were in the middle of relaying the carpet (no disruption to guests that I could see) and that was half completed by the time we left. The staff, from the manager and reception staff through to the chambermaids are all very friendly and helpful - and it feels like a genuine charm, not a forced corporate cheeriness. We took the breakfast in the little breakfast room - at 8e, I didn't see many places cheaper nearby and it was generous (help yourself to as much as you need, with cheese, ham and yogourts in addition to nice fresh croissants and bread , with individual large jugs of coffee and hot milk brought to your table ) We were on the top floor in one of the superior rooms, which gives a bit more space - a great and unexpected view of the top half of Eiffel tower lit up at night was possible by looking out of the window to the right.", "Date": "June 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cAnother great stay!\u201d", "Author": "maven74", "ReviewID": "UR7684033", "Content": "When we found another great airfare deal to Paris, we knew we had to stay here again.

The hotel is central but on a very quiet street. My only negative experience came from the amount of noise in the room above me. I didn't hear anyone else, but the walls must be pretty thin, and also the couple above me spoke in really loud voices. For some reason the first night they woke me up at 4:30 am shouting from bathroom to bedroom, laughing and carrying on at full volume.

First of all, the location is excellent. We used the RER \"B\" coming from CDG airport and had only a short walk to the hotel. It was easy to find and because it is just off of Boulevard St. Germain, it is in a quiet location. However, you are still only steps away from a variety of restaurants, cafes, bakeries, and sandwich type places. Also, the location puts you only a few minutes walk to Notre Dame and the islands and the shops in Saint Germain. There are bus stops a stone's throw away, which make getting to places like the Eiffel Tower very easy. And of course, there are several Metro stops that are very convenient as well. The front desk staff couldn't have been nicer. We arrived early in the morning (8:30) after a flight from the US and were very tired. Check-in was a breeze and our room was available right then. The staff were very helpful with transportation questions and arranging for an early morning cab-ride to the train station on the day of our departure. As for the hotel itself, it is quaint and served our needs perfectly. The free internet access was a big plus. Breakfast wasn't a huge selection but a nice assortment of croissants, pain au chocolat, yogurt, jams and spreads, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and meats and cheeses. Our room was small by US standards but it was adequate. The bed was comfy and we had a nice flat screen TV with a good selection of stations including the BBC news. The room also had a closet, desk area w/chair, phone, safe, and 2 large windows. The bathroom was very clean and the shower had great water pressure. Our room was cleaned impeccably each day.

It was not a very big room but perfectly adequate for our stay. We did not intend to spend much time in the room anyway! The room had a flat screen tv on the wall, which we liked, but didn't have the radio alarm clock that all rooms should apparently have. We didn't need one so it didn't bother us, but it is just an observation. I'm sure the hotel would have provided one if we had asked, they seemed very friendly and keen to ensure our stay was enjoyable. The staff were really nice with us and humoured us as we spoke french. My husband and I both enjoy learning the languages and cultures of other countries and can find it slightly irritating when staff automatically start speaking to you in english like you're an idiot. Once they realised we really wanted to try the trip with no english, they were more than happy to oblige, which was nice! The breakfast was really nice - orange juice, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, milk, cereals (cornflakes and chocolate flakes), croissants, pains au chocolat, baguettes, ham and cheese, a selection of jams and marmalade were on offer every day. Thoroughly enjoyable! We checked out at about 11am on Monday and the hotel let us leave our suitcase in the room next to the reception desk all day. The only problem that I could see with this hotel in the near future would be if you intended staying during the week. There are roadworks currently being carried out.

Might be wise to check with the hotel how long they're going on for, or request a room at the back of the hotel? The hotel's location is perfect. A very short walk away from the RER Ligne B that takes you to and from CDG airport. A couple of minutes walk from Notre Dame, the Batobus stop and the tour bus stops. There are two fantastic restaurants nearby also, Le Coupe Chou which was wonderful and not full of tourists. There were quite a few french people sitting around us and again, the waiter was happy to oblige and speak french only. Le Reminet is also really close (on the way to Notre Dame). I was apprehensive when we went in as it was full of tourists (one table with 3 american women was particularly loud and obnoxious) but the food turned out to be lovely. I was a bit irked when the waitress insisted upon speaking in english despite our repeated attempts at french but it turned out she was going to live in Boston shortly and wanted the practice, so we let her off with it!!!

I moved out -- to great apologies and a discount, but they didn't make up for a pretty awful experience.", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Two Star Hotel\u201d", "Author": "JustOneBoomer", "ReviewID": "UR5425475", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel du College de France for 4 nights in early June. We had stayed there before in 1995. The hotel is still in the same family, but is now owned and managed by a nephew who was very helpful and professional and spoke excellent English. Sometimes the front desk was covered by someone less polished, but the service was still acceptable even then. The hotel is in an excellent location, on a small street off Rue Saint Germain, so it is fairly quiet. It is walking distance to Notre Dame and Saint Chapelle. It is a block from the Sorbonne and a block from the Cluny Museum (of medieval art, including the unicorn tapestry). There are many restaurants in the area and perhaps because of the student presence, they were on the less expensive side for Paris. The metro and RER are a 2 block walk. Our room was small, but the space was well planned. The bathroom had definitely been upgraded since our last visit. There was a shower-tub and plenty of hot water with good water pressure. Our room was not air conditioned and a few days were in the 80's. There was a fan in our room when we checked in which was sufficient for us at this time of year. There are large windows which open, but as is the case all over France, there are no screens. There is an old cage elevator and a spiral staircase. The hotel might not be appropriate for people with mobility issues and not being able to use the stairs would be a problem in the event of an emergency. Our room rate was 95 Euros, including taxes, which is about $114 if I am doing the math correctly. Breakfast is not included, but is available for 8 euros. You can get a cheaper breakfast on the street. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel until the last morning. I think it was a very fair value. There was a very good restaurant right across the street (25.50 for the menu of the day). Most of the patrons were French (which meant some smoking), but the meal was one of the best we had in France. The restaurant is very popular, so reservations would be necessary.", "Date": "July 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Placentia, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Small Hotel\u201d", "Author": "janearlgarcia", "ReviewID": "UR5394418", "Content": "Being that it was our first trip to Paris, it was nice that we were not disappointed in our hotel.

I am saying this after several trips to Paris. I stayed around the corner last time at Hotel St. Jacques, and this hotel on Rue Thenard was on a side street which made it very quiet in comparison to the Rue Des Ecoles address for the St. Jacques. The price was great and the rooms, although very basic in decor and small in size had many upgrades and updates for such an old building. There was a dressing table with two outlets which was very convenient. The bathroom we had was rather large. We had two windows.

Three of us stayed here in the middle of March and we all loved it. Each of our rooms was perfect for one person. The bathrooms were spotless and the decor, although a bit shabby, was clean. There were tall windows that we propped open because the heat was on. (It was very cold outside.) None of our rooms smelled of smoke. One of us had a tiny balcony off of her 5th floor room that looked down on a side street that dead-ended to a charming little church. One had a room at the front of the hotel and the third had one that overlooked an interior courtyard (this room was the quietest.) None of us had a problem sleeping at night, despite some rowdy student protests nearby due to the proximity of the university a block away. When we came home late at night the front door was locked, we rang the bell, and were quickly admitted by one of the nice young men (Fabrice and Bruno) who worked the front desk at night. We had breakfast there several mornings, wonderful baguettes, cheese and croissants, great coffee. We also found brasseries and cafes within a block or two for cafe creme (pronounced \"krem\", equivalent of a latte.) We had dinner at the restaurant across the street (Le Pre Verre?) which was pricey but wonderful, a very adventurous and unusual menu. We also walked up rue Thenard, went left on rue des Ecoles, took the first right and then the first left, to come to Le Petit Prince, which was one of the best meals we had in the neighborhood for the money. It is also a lovely and popular restaurant. Mr. Santa Ana at the front desk recommended Le Petit Zinc, got us a reservation and a cab to the restaurant which is located not far away near St Germain de Pres church, and the food was fantastic. I honestly don't think you can get a bad meal in Paris. They do eat dinner later there, around 8:30 or 9, but if you have an earlier reservation, they don't seem to rush you out. The location of CDF of course couldn't be better. We walked to the river and Notre Dame almost every morning to start our day. Walked to the Louvre and to the Cluny (we love the Cluny.) There are many classical music concerts in churches all over Paris and there are some within walking distance of CDF. You'll usually find brochures and flyers advertising these concerts at the front desk. We rode buses that ran West on rue des Ecoles and came back to CDF on buses that ran East on Blvd St-Germain. We stayed out of the subway for two reasons: the gangs of kids that target people in the Metro who don't move quickly like they know where they're going, in other words, tourists; and second, if we went underground we would have missed seeing the beautiful parks and buildings of the city. All three of us would stay at the Hotel College de France again. We only hope that nothing changes it before we have a chance to come back again!", "Date": "March 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Twickenham, London", "Title": "\u201cTop Marks for Top Hotel\u201d", "Author": "MrTwick", "ReviewID": "UR4459342", "Content": "My partner and I stayed here from Feb 9th to 12th for our Valentines weekend getaway.

I chose the HCF based on TA reviews for the hotel for the trip on which I proposed to my girlfriend. As soon as we turned down the rue Thenard, I knew I made the right choice. The hotel is situated on a quiet corner of the Boulevard Saint Germain. Its facade is simple and elegant. Upon entry, the quaint feel of the HCF is apparent and palpable. The warm tones of the hotel really make the hotel cozy. We were checked in by the hotel manager who was helpful from the beginning. Our check in was simple and quick, and we were in our room within minutes. The elevator is quite small, so I took the bags up while my fiancee walked up the amazing spiral staircase. We were given Room 23, a corner room with a balcony overlooking the streets below and the College de France (I feel that our room had the best location but apparently was smallest, based on the comparison of the hotel diagram). The room had a sizeable closet, a safe, two wicker chairs, a mirror and table, TV and internet connection. The bathroom was smallish as well, but had a toilet, sink, mirror, and deep tub and handheld shower head that we both learned to love after walking the city. The front desk keeps your key for you every time you leave, and at night a member of the staff attends the locked door. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. The cleaning staff were extremely friendly, respecting our wishes about when we wanted our room cleaned. They even did things like hold doors and turn on lights that gave the HCF staff a family feel. The location of the HCF was ideal. The 5th Arr. was perfect for us with a bustle during the day and minimal noise in the evening. The college and tourist atmosphere was exactly what I wanted out of our Parisian experience. There were both Metro and RER stops close by, and great places to eat, among them two great food stands with great crepes, several 24 hr. brasseries and cafes, a pastry shop, and a great street that was always busy called rue de la Huchette that had many small bars, food stands, and great atmosphere as there was always something happening. I rate the HCF as excellent for what it is. It does not try to be a four star resort but make the most of its two stars, a comfortable value in a great Parisian neighborhood. Our first night was a bit noisy, but it seemed that it was the result of some renovations. Our neighbors (in the hotel) and staff were up and working by 9 and could sometimes be heard. The outside noise was minimal to nonexistant, a quiet street for the neighborhood. If you're looking for a clean comfortable value near the 5th Arr., you must check out the Hotel du College de France.
