The princess rooms are beutifully decorated and very colorful. The only downside about the room was that the new comforter was very hard and not comfortable to sleep with. Also the housekeeping people came very late around 3:30pm to clean the room. The hotel is very big so there's lots and lots of walking. I think the most beautiful parts of this hotel is the Oak Manor and Paterre Place areas. My only dislike was that the lobby looks old and I think it should be renovated. I had to wait around 30 minutes to complete my check in which was a little bit frustrating because I thought that since I had already done the online check in the process was going to be faster. When I arrived at the hotel they had only 4 staff members (in my opinion they were extremely slow) doing the check in's. Other down side is the food court area which should also get renovated because it looks old and it's very small for the large hotel. During rush hours it gets very busy. My favorite food station was the Pasta station. Overall I really liked the beutiful gardens and renovated princess rooms. I've stayed at other Disney hotels such as Pop Century, Old Key West and Caribbean Beach Resort and I think each of Disney's hotels has something special about it.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cNOT BAD FOR THE PRICE BUT ....\u201d", "Author": "MRJILLY", "ReviewID": "UR129202692", "Content": "Trip started on the wrong foot when the delivery of lugage(we are clothes and packing phobics) took more than seven hours.

Didn't need a car at Disney, so that saved some money. Comfortable trip. The good points - the staff is friendly, bus service within Disney is convenient, the room A/C works well, and the water pressure is good. The room did not smell bad, either. West bus stop is the first, so if you want to be sure to get a seat, this is the best bet. The less good points - we reserved a room with a king bed but were \"downgraded\" to 2 full beds. No apologies, no compensation. The beds are VERY hard, and we didn't sleep well. Bathroom is kind of grungy, especially the tile grout. Soundproofing is poor (connecting rooms since it's a family hotel), and since entry is from outside (no halls), it can be noisy early as people head to the park. The A/C is the type with a fan that runs continuously, but the compressor turning on and off all night also affected our sleep quality. We were in building 35 which is a 5 minute walk to the lobby and restaurant. This was ok except a long walk with luggage (and no one offered to drive us in a cart). We were also on the second floor (no elevators, of course) and a good 200 feet from the stairs. Be sure to get a ground floor room if this is a problem (and beware of French Quarter with 3 floors). The quick service meals are not very good and the more formal restaurant only a bit better - but fine for kids, certainly. VERY crowded at breakfast but reasonably fast. There are designated outdoor smoking areas. There are also a lot of guests walking around smoking. The grounds are well landscaped but not to the immaculate standard of most Disney properties. Next time, we will either stay at one of the high end hotels on the resort (Grand Floridian, Polynesian, or Contemporary) or stay outside the park. Tip - you don't need to be a resort hotel guest to ride the Disney buses. Stay just outside the park and walk across the street to a resort bus stop instead - better value. The Port Orleans Riverside was worse than a Holiday Inn Express, Marriott Fairfield or Hampton Inn. Think Quality/Comfort/Days Inn - but more expensive.

I had heard such great praise about this hotel and couldn't wait to try to it out. I have stayed at many of the Disney Hotels and it's usually you get what you pay for. This being a Moderate Hotel I was surprised when the service was below value. I'll start with the positives, the grounds are beautiful. The problems started when I got my room key and was told it was on the second floor. I had to park very far from the building because there was construction in the building next door and the closest parking lot was reserved for construction workers. So it was quite a hike with 2 small kids. The room was on the second floor with no elevator and once inside we found a dead cockroach inside one of the drawers. We found a little girl\u2019s princess crown on top of the pillows and thought perhaps the hotel assumed we had a daughter because we had requested a trundle bed (we have two sons). The room was not cleaned on the first day; we were surprised to find it just how we left it in the morning. The construction of the building next door kept us from walking around our area and using the closest pool because there were strong fumes from the paint or whatever they were doing. This did push us to walk around and really see how beautiful the hotel property was, however, it made me wonder why we were stuck in the back in an area called the Alligator Bayou when there were so many beautiful areas where no construction was happening. On our last day we did not receive our check out statement under the door as requested and the housekeeping staff was pushing us out of the room at 9:00 am. When we left she gave us a dirty look, then she chased us down to give us the princess crown we had found the first day, it was then that I realized the room had not been properly cleaned before our arrival and explained to her that that had been in the room the whole time. It would take a lot for me to change my mind on this Disney hotel. I visit Disney an average of two times a year and have stayed in most of the on site resorts and this has been by far the most disappointing Disney experience I have ever had.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cnice disney property\u201d", "Author": "kakEngland", "ReviewID": "UR129034728", "Content": "Went as a couple, lovely surroundings had quiet area magnolia bend but not to far from amenities clean and lots to do for families or couples, food okay, this is not a hotel for personal service but if you need anything just ask and they will be happy to oblige, only 10 min wait for buses if that came regularly, may be busy at peak times, boat down to downtown disney lovely to do, fair bit of walking to and fro but if ask for a room close to amenities not a problem, very nice resort many peaceful areas away from amenities.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cDisney Trip\u201d", "Author": "tigers357", "ReviewID": "UR128969577", "Content": "Port Orleans Riverside was wonderful!

Well, I'm happy to report the new Royal Rooms are quite an improvement! We booked specifically at this property for the Royal Rooms, which just opened, because we have a little Beauty & the Beast fan among us. And he is a boy. I have heard many people say \"you booked a princess room for your son??\" But I can assure you the rooms are hardly decked out in a princess theme, rather you feel like you're staying in a room of a castle. The colors are subdued (no pink here) and the only way it feels princess-y is if you count the 4-5 small pictures of Disney princesses on the walls (there are also pictures of princes). The fireworks display above the bed is a real highlight, it's a 30-second \"show\" you get at the press of a button near your bed. There are cool details you can find pictures/videos of online, like the Aladdin sinks. There are some nice touches here. Even the AC vent is covered. Because we have a toddler we came back to the room for naps. A quick call each morning to Housekeeping ensured our room would be made up--we just gave them a wide time range of when we'd be at the park. We forgot to do this the first day and while they left us a generous bag of towels and toiletries, we badly needed the trash taken. Oh well! There is a small fridge, dorm size. Handy for cartons of juice and stuff like that. Everything else is standard hotel room stuff, iron&board, hairdryer, and a room safe (with a key, very old school). The low-light of this property is the dining hall. While we were not on a Disney meal plan, we did use the dining hall at Riverside two times out of sheer convenience and both times were a disaster. There are severely limited options here and all are very overpriced. There are NO vegetarian options, be forewarned if you have any vegetarian travelers. A meatless salad will set you back $10. Everything will set you back about $10. The service is unbearably slow. If you are dining with others, good luck getting your food at once and being able to eat together, it didn't happen for us and we saw so many other people in the same boat. Come to think of it, I've never seen such slow service anywhere. The property is well laid out and the buses aren't far from wherever you are.

My personal favorite snack in all of Disney is the Magic Cookie Bar which can only be found at Riverside (to my knowledge). But if you don't see anything here that you want to eat, just walk or hop on the boat to Port Orleans French Quarter. We ate there one night and it was delicious! I noticed that both at Riverside and French Quarter they are showing Disney movies on the lawn with a giant blow up screen - very neat! We didn't watch, as we spent a lot of time in the parks.

The room was your normal hotel room with two double beds which being used to a King was a bit uncomfortable, but not enough to make me NOT want to go back. There was a privacy curtain in front of the vanity which was nice for my daughter to have her own space while getting ready. This would be especially good for people who may be traveling together, but do not know each other in the \"personal\" sense! The property was well maintained and spotless. If there was a downside, I would say it had to be the price of food no matter where you went - but especially in the resort. Don't expect to get a cheeseburger for under $10.00. The mugs were a great investment. We traveled with three people, two adults and a teenager. We really only needed two mugs.

I was going to originally stay at a deluxe Disney hotel, but figured I wouldn't be in the room that much and it was somewhat less expensive. Upon my arrival, the main building seemed fine. However, the lady that checked me in wasn't, in my opinion, up to Disney standards. She wasn't very friendly and seemed a little.dishevelled. Not your typical Disney employee. I looked at the other front desk staff and about a third wasn't what I would expect to see at Disney. This resort is very spread out. I was assigned to a room farthest from the main building. There is no.way you would want to walk this far. You would definitely want to drive to where the restaurants and pools are located. The room, which was just renovated, screamed, holiday inn. The only nice part was the white silestone countertop and the carpet. It was also really dark in the room. The bathroom was tiny. I had a standard view which equals parking lot view. I would have loved to look at the open lot w some trees. My view was the staircase so it felt like I was in a cave. However, I could overlook all of this since I knew it was a moderate resort. The one thing that I couldn't overcome was the bed. When I got into it, it had one of those creepy plastic mattress covers that you could feel and hear. The bed was so uncomfortable. I woke up several times during the night. By the morning, I was cursing myself for tryin.g to.save a few bucks. I dialed 0 and asked to talk to the front.desk manager. I was then transferred to housekeeping who transferred me to a totally different hotel! After I finally got the proper person, I asked if we could be moved to another room that had a better bed. She called me back and was going to move me upstairs. When I asked if it had a more comfortable bed, she said no it was exactly the same room. I wasn't sure how that was going to solve my problem. I asked if she could find me a room in one of the deluxe hotels. She called me back in 10 minutes and gave me an option at a great price. Needless to say, this bad experience was made good in my book by this manager. This is what I expect from Disney. The next 2 nights I slept much better and walked away a happy customer.

The room was clean and pleasant with a New Orleans decor. I was disappointed in the bed spreads which were itchy and uncomfortable. I prefer the duvet which most of the above average hotels now use. The property was very beautiful. It is huge but set up in a way so that no one is far from the dining room or shuttles. The kids all enjoyed the pool and water slide. The dining room had a lot of reasonably priced food choices for all palates. The shuttles were on time and convenient and that in and of itself makes it worth it to stay at a Disney property but it does take 30 minutes to get to most of the parks so take that into consideration when planning. Some of the shuttles go directly to Riverside but some of the shuttles also go to the French Quarter (another part of the Port Orleans complex) and then you are looking at about a 45 minute transport. If I had unlimited money I would stay at a hotel on the monorail but all in all this was a very pleasant experience.

This was our first time staying at the Port Orleans - Riverside, and we booked a brand new Royalty room for our princesses! While it was more of a wait to check-in than I had expected, the cast members were friendly and accommodating, giving me a letter from Princess Tiana to each of my daughters and a birthday button for my daughter. Our room was in Oak Manor, and when we opened the door, our girls were beyond excited! The room was beautiful and the girls loved the fireworks above the beds, and the princess touches throughout the room! We thought we were a little far from everything, but in fact, we had a short walk and across the bridge to the right for the main pool, or a short walk to the left and over the bridge to the food, store and South Depot bus stops. We found it very easy and peaceful to walk along the river and over the bridge, especially at night after long days at the parks! We all loved the boat ride to Downtown Disney and wished we didn't have to take the bus anywhere! It was nice to come back each night and have peacefulness instead of screaming kids and tons of people around as in the past at the All Star Resorts. We did have 2 problems: 1 in the food court our first morning concerning a food allergy. A woman named Gerdine or something similar from Haiti at the create your own omelette station apparently gave someone else my daughter's order and then ignored my husband when he asked how she could give it away, and is she absolutely sure the one she was trying to give him was his since they were going out of order. She just ignored him and kept saying the number, and my husband was trying to ask what was on it because I have a mushroom allergy, and he had heard someone order mushrooms just before him. She didn't seem to care and just kept saying the order #, so my husband pushed it back to her. While I was waiting just next door for my other daughter's breakfast, I could see/hear her talking about my husband (although I couldn't quite understand her - she did not speak clear English), and I turned to her and said she should treat guests better. He was inquiring because of a food allergy that could make me very sick and she was just ignorant to him. Problem #2: We went to Typhoon Lagoon one day, and left at about 4:30 to catch the bus because we had a carriage ride reservation at 7 that night and needed to all get washed and changed. It only took us 10 minutes to get to the waterpark, so we thought this was plenty of time. The waterpark closed at 6 that night, so we didn't think there would be any problems with the bus. Well, we were WRONG! We had just missed a bus (it pulled away as my daughter and I ran to the front door of the bus). So after waiting 1/2 hour (making it 5:00 or so), a bus pulls up and the driver tells us there are no other buses to the resort that day so we would have to get on the bus with him and be dropped off at the Marketplace and get a bus from there. So what else could we do? We got on a very crowded bus, and thankfully a nice couple offered me a seat since I was carrying my 2 year old! After arriving at the marketplace, we waited with a large crowd in the hot sun for another 1/2 hour for a bus to come (meanwhile there were 2 and 3 buses for alot of the other resorts - even the All Stars and Pop Century resorts had more buses than us). By the time we got back to our room (after also stopping at French Quarter first), it was after 6. I gave the 2 year old a quick bath and the rest of us all took the quickest showers we could, and we ended up being 15 minutes late by the time we walked over to the carriage ride area. Thankfully the carriage driver was ver considerate and still accomodated us for our ride. This was a surprise to the girls, and they just loved it! We just couldn't believe it took us 1 1/2 hours to get back from Typhoon Lagoon which was only 10 minutes away! I really hope Disney reconsiders this method of using the bus service! We all pay good money to enjoy ourselves on vacation, and do not want to keep going from one bus stop to another and spending hours waiting for buses! (Also moderate resorts don't give balloons in the room for birthdays like the value resorts do - at least they didn't for my daughter this trip. All Star left her balloons and an autographed card from cinderella with a picture in the past!)

Our check-in went smoothly, and we were in one of the new royal rooms with two queen-sized beds in the Oak Building by 3:00. The rooms are decorated very nicely with a fireworks headboard, nice princess pictures on the walls--everything new, which is so nice when staying at Disney. The biggest downside was the beds (queen size by the way) were hard, and the pillows were awful. Thank goodness I brought a pillow from home. Beds are very important to me when I travel, so for some of you this may not be a big deal, but personally I like a softer bed. I will try to keep my review brief and just outline the positives and the negatives. Positives: New rooms!! Outdoor movies at night (my child LOVED this!) Pool games/prizes (again, my seven-year-old boy had a blast!) Convenient access to Downtown Disney via boat Poolside bar made great drinks Boat rental Horsedrawn carriage rides Plenty to do for the kids Nice gift shop. Negatives: Again, beds were hard. Granted, not the worst that I have slept on while staying on Disney, That distinction would be left to the All Star Movies Resort. Still, not great. My inlaws had an issue with the maid service. It was resolved, and they received a new person, but the incident shouldn't have happened. Honestly, despite the fact that the grounds are pretty, I just found it to be kind of a boring resort. Resort is very large and spread out. Rooms aren't sound-proofed very well. Consistently heard someone flushing the toilet late every night. Rooms are small. Washcloths/towels were very thin. Room safe was a joke. You can barely fit an iPad in there and a few other items. VERY small. I would suggest if you travel with a lot of jewelry, valuables, etc. to bring along something bigger to store them while at the parks. In summary, would I stay here again, probably not. We live in Florida and visit Disney on average most months out of the year. We have stayed at so many other hotels/resorts in Orlando when we travel to Disney that I just do not think it's worth the money. However, if you are looking for a nice moderate resortwant to stay on Disney and not spend the money for a Deluxe, are okay with hard beds, I think this resort would be fine for you.

Of course, we enjoyed the recreational pool with the spa, slide, and water fun for kids, but we likewise loved the quiet pools tucked between the manor buildings. The marina- fabulous to as a hang-out and for the relaxing options. We took a trip to DT Disney on the free water taxi and rented a \"party barge\" so we could take our own dear sweet time cruising the river. Another fabulous feature- the food court. Enough options from \"grab and go\" items to hot made-to-order meals. Our favorite was the Create-Your-Own-Pasta counter- ample portions and delicious options. And, yes, while it did get busy at peak times, it never felt crowded and the service staff was friendly and helpful. Hint: Plan your stay for when the FREE DINING PLAN is offered. Our room was small but very comfortable, pretty, and centrally located. The bus service to the parks- very reliable. We never felt panicked about missing a bus because another soon followed.

The trip itself was amazing. The hotel.... We were there for 7 nights. I had stayed in the Caribbean Beach Resort, which was on the same tier, and expected a comfortable room with lovely grounds and friendly staff. I expected a Motel 6-quality room, but with bright, cheery colors. I expected a food court with decent food. What we got was the following: 1. Upon check-in, NO bellhop service was offered. The grounds are large, so it was a very long walk to our hotel room. There were no elevators, so after hauling our luggage half a mile we then had to carry it up stairs and around a long balcony walk. I'm a strong girl. I can carry heavy stuff. But if I'm paying that much I shouldn't have to. 2. The room was dark and depressing. I understand the whole \"bayou/swamp\" theme going on with the hotel, but they should have placed more lamps about the room if they wanted to use dark wood in the decor. The sheets on the bed were made of some sort of knit material that kept sliding off us at night. It was like the bed was short-sheeting itself. Also, the bathroom was SO tiny it was hard to sit down on the toilet and shutting the door without bruising a knee. (And I'm average height. Imagine my 6'1\" husband.) 3. The food court was cool-looking, with a big water-wheel in the middle of it. The food quality was so bad I believe I ate the worst cheeseburger I've ever eaten. My advice: eat in the parks. Or, if you want to go cheap, eat at one of the sandwich shops in Downtown Disney. 4. The river ferry to Downtown Disney was NOT convenient. It's so far down the river from DD that it takes like 45 min to get there. Take the buses. However, be aware that on the buses, since Port Orleans is the last hotel on the route, you will probably end up standing for most of your ride. 5. I was horribly sick the day we left, with a respiratory flu so bad I had trouble breath just sitting. We asked for help with our luggage and they said no bellhops were available.

Now as I mentioned we stayed in one of the new royal Guest rooms. Sure it was nice, had a Disney princess theme, which my daughter loved, and it was all clean and new. But probably most importantly is that this room was in Oak Manor which is very close to the main building, so paying the little extra for this type of room won't get you much in the way of amenities, but it will get you CLOSER to amenities.

I started going here when I was 11 so I know a little bit. 1) request a mansion room over the alligator bayou section. Nicer rooms and surroundings. 2) if you don't want to deal with excessive splashing or noise don't go to the main pool. Go to the pools near the mansions. Much nicer. 3) take the water taxi to downtown! Its very relaxing. 4) bay the refillable cups, they'll pay for themselves. 5) go and see the entertainer near the lobby tons of fun and a free show!

The grounds are lush with lots of greenery making it feel a little more secluded. For a quick bite, there's Riverside Mill food court, with a variety of meals and snacks for breakfast, lunch and dinner. There's also Boatwright's Dining Hall for a nice sit-down dinner. Make sure to check out entertainer, Bob Jackson, in the River Roost Lounge. He's a terrific piano player, and lots of fun to watch. One of my favorite things about POR is being able to take a Friendship Ferry to Downtown Disney. After a long day of walking the parks, it's very relaxing to hop on the ferry to Downtown Disney. There are lots of other activities at POR for families. There's Old Man Island which is a great place to swim and play, or take a Sea Raycer out for a spin at the Marina. There's cane fishing (catch and release) and bike rentals, as well.

I have stayed at a few other Disney Resorts (Polynesian, Wilderness Lodge, All Star Music) and I think I preferred each of them to this hotel. I loved the overall beauty of the grounds, and at first enjoyed the huge, spawling, southern feel of the resort layout. However, I quickly realized that 10-15 minute walk from the lobby/restaurant to our room was going to be inconvenient. If you are looking for a centrally located hotel, with quick service to and from the parks, this is not your choice. But if you want a quaint, relatively quiet hotel with nice rooms and friendly staff, and you aren't too conerned about time-tables, this may be a nice place for you. I loved the pools, liked the food choices, and loved the boat access to Downtown disney. We were directly in the middle of 2 bus stops, and both were long walks from our room. The bus service was maddening at times, the buses arrived few and far between, and sometimes we waited for 30 minutes for our chosen bus to arrive while at the main bus stop. There didn't seem to be any logic in how the buses arrived... we would often see 3 buses for one location arrive back to back to back and then leave empty while leaving a bus-stop full of riders waiting for a specific bus that arrived all too infrequently. There are 4 bus stops at the resort, but I wouldn't recommend waiting at one of the smaller ones as we frequently passed them by because our bus was full. The worst part of the bus ride however, is the fact that we always seemed to be last on the line, so there were frequent stops both to and fro the parks. At the end of the night, it was very draining. We lost so much time to travel that it really cut into my enjoyment - it would sometimes be an hour or more from the time you arrive at the bus stop to our destination, not to mention the additional time walking from the room to the bus. The food in the food court was passable, and the kids enjoyed the fountain drinks. We dined at the main restaurant as well, and had a nice dining experience there... much less manic than the pace in the food court which was somewhat chaotic. The din in the food court was quite uncomfortable. The boat ride to downtown Disney was thoroughly enjoyable, and a nice leisurely alternative to the buses. It was a nice way to enjoy the scenery of the hotel grounds and some adjacent hotels as well on the way to the shops and restaurants downtown. The pools are great, we had a nice quiet pool close to our room and the kids really enjoyed it - the one downside is that the smaller pools never had towels - you would have to take a long walk to the main pool, grab towels, and then walk back to the pool. Eventually we smartened up and decided to grab towels upon our return to the hotel at night by taking a small detour to the main pool and then going back to our room to change. Disney World is great, the hotel is beautiful, the staff was friendly and welcoming, and I hate to give this hotel a bad review but I think that there are better options - especially for the price we paid. The hotel was highly recommended by friends and family alike, and if not for the travel delays, I really would have said that this is a great hotel. I won't stay here again, but would certainly visit Disney again.

If you're the type of person who likes long walks or bike rides in serene settings this is the place for you. I can't say enough about the beauty of this resort. Even though it's a Disney property it doesn't feel overly touristy. The rooms are nice. We had one that wasn't refurbished and I was surprised at how well maintained it still was. I even looked behind the sink and could find a spec of dust. Faucets shined. Felt totally comfortable walking around the room in bare feet. Nothing on these floors. We arrived at the whopping early hour of 6am. We drove a straight 12 hours. I checked in fully prepared to be told our room wasn't ready and to sleep it off in the car. To my surprise and JOY our room was ready!!! If there's any doubt as to whether Disney holds out on rooms, saying your room isn't ready when in fact it is, you can rest easy. They want to get you into your room ASAP. We ate at the Mill cafeteria everyday. It was quick and convenient. Didn't try Boatrights. Sit down dinners at Disney are just too crazy pricy for me. I prefer quick services. This resort is enormous though. We did a 10 minute walk everyday to breakfast. If you have trouble walking I wouldn't recommend this resort. If you do make sure you get a room close to the amenities you need. I enjoyed the walks. It was beautiful. Ducks, lizards, and squirrels everywhere. Gorgeous. Only downfall was the busses. Not that it was terrible for me, but the busses were pretty inconsistent. They showed up, but you might see 3 busses to EPCOT before you see a bus to Magic Kingdom. I know there are circumstances that cause the busses to get held up, for instance handicapped people take longer to get situated. I think they do their best to get everyone where they need to go.

My husband and I weren't in that category. We live nearby and have been to the parks many times. This was the first time we splurged for staying on property instead of driving home, since we were celebrating our anniversary. We had a great experience from the moment we drove on to the property. The valets and bellmen in front were very friendly, even though we didn't use their services, and check-in was a breeze (we checked in around noon even though check-in is officially 3 PM). Our room was about an 8-minute walk, if that, from the lobby/restaurant area. (We were in a King bed room in building 25.) It was a very peaceful walk, past natural plantings and over little ponds/streams, and we didn't mind it at all. In fact, we usually saw rabbits hopping by or grazing, which was fun. Our room was very quiet (we did hear some kids playing in the nearby small pool on our last morning), and the decor was homier than most hotels (shuttered, corner windows, an amoire to hide the TV, no \"hotel white\" tiles in the bathroom/vanity area). The closet area was open and there was no cooler (dorm fridge) for drinks or leftovers - otherwise, I have no quibbles. The room was cleaned and made up nicely while we were away. Since our aim was to relax (and sleep in for once!), we skipped the morning rush, getting to the food court around 11 AM and heading over to the parks after that. One night we took the river boat cruise to Downtown Disney and back, and would highly recommend that for a relaxing change. Boats were running every ten minutes during peak times, and ran until about 11:30 PM. We never waited more than 10 minutes for a bus to go to and from the park. When going to the park, the bus displays instructions including advising you to ask the driver exactly where to return to catch the bus. We didn't, and should have, because the pick up area was not exactly where he dropped us off, and we missed one bus before we realized this. The food court had a lot of choices, including grab-and-go containers of fruit and so forth. I wasn't too impressed with the choose-your-own-toppings pasta station (shrimp was good, noodles were overcooked). One day we had breakfast at the French Quarter food court, and really liked the beignets and omelet we had.

The bathroom was tiny, although the dressing area was large enough and contained two pedestal sinks. There was a small refrigerator in the room which was convenient, but an adjoining room for other family members had a fridge that was totally frozen with ice in it and had to be serviced before it could be used. It was a long walk to the lobby, the bus stop and the parking lot. Check-in was slow and I went to another line to purchase a 3-day pass to the parks. After an interminable wait for the pass, which took at least 15 minutes (supposedly a problem with the computers), I found the next day that the card was rejected at the park and had to be repurchased,so after waiting in line to get into the park, I had to get into yet another line to repurchase the pass. The food in the restaurant located in the lobby building was overpriced and of very poor quality.

Had a look around the hotel, huge gift shop filled with snacks and souvenirs, arcade is a decent size and you are greeted by a beautiful view of the water, horse drawn carriages and Disney boats. its so relaxing at night after a long long day at the parks. ROOMS- rooms are a good size with a decent sized fridge and coffee maker and the room was everything else you would expect from a moderate resort. our rooms were always cleaned out regularly. because of having senior citizens in our party we had requested rooms close to the amenities on our booking. we were on magnolia bend which was straight in front of the bridge, beautifully located by the water. the walk was still quite long to the bus stops, and food court but this was the closest we were going to get! i recommend you request close rooms before you travel. the food court is quite dark but we preferred to sit outside by the river and watch the boats. there is a good selection of eating options also a good point about this resort, if you don't want to keep walking to fill your resort mugs, take bottles of drinks to the room to store in your fridge. we found this very helpful. the buses. compared to resorts like the all stars, instead of separate lines to section each theme park off from one and other, all the buses were directed to only 2 depots. It is a free for all to get on the buses with no lines. we did not find this easy. we once got to the bus depot first and ended up not getting a seat because of no lines. plus ts the end of the night when you catch the bus home, it drops off at 4 other depots before arriving at the main depot.

The food selection at Riverside is similar to French Quarter. There are also bikes to rent, our kids loved the 4 person bike.

The resort is located relatively close to Magic kingdom, Epcot, Downtown Disney and Hollywood studios. So once you get on a bus, you won't have too long a ride. But there are 4 stops at this resort and sometimes they also include a stop at Port Orleans French quarter. They provide extra busses during peak seasons, but if you are at Disney during a non peak time you are going to wait a long time for a bus. The entire resort is in the process of room renovations.

At check in the lady behind the counter was extremely helpful, I think her name was Roxanne (sorry if spelling is incorrect) and lovely to talk to. ROOM: We booked a kingroom and wanted to know if the room is one of the newly renovated one as from the reviews here, I got the impression that the rooms that have not had the reno done would be rather crummy so initially was disappointed to find out our room has not been renovated and there are non available at time of check in but without us requesting again, Roxanne made a call to see if there would be one avail the next day and she did get one for us and advised us that we'd get a call at 9am the next morning to confirm if we want to go ahead with room change. We got to our King room which is in the Alligator bayou section, room 2633 and we loved it! It won't suits everyone's tastes but it was homely, and reminded us of a room you'd find it you had a cottage like room in snow white, well maybe not quite that but the king bed was big and comfy, the bedhead had that 'log like' look about it, flat screen tv which is kept in the cubboard that you can open up when you want to watch tv, fridge, coffee machine. there's a curtain that separate the bathroom/sink area, overall, we were happy so made the trip back to Roxanne to tell her not to worry about the room change. Before we cancel room change, we walked over to the newly renovated area and had a peek into the new room and we actually prefer ours, the nenovated room had a more modern feel ofcourse but I rather like our rustic look of alligator bayou room and also prefer the building that its in. As mentioned, if you prefer more modern look, you may prefer the reno room. Alligator buyou area was also lovely and quiet, away from the noisy section. Resort: Love the look and feel of this resort, we saw French Quarter which was the other one we had considered but glad that we ended up chosing Riverside. We were so busy themeparking that we didn't have a chance to enjoy the serenity of our resort but walking around the garden area was just lovely. It is lush with lots of beautiful trees/plants. It reminds me of someplace I've been but can't remember or a place I'd like to be but has never been. I certainly feel like I was on a holiday but still at home. There's also coin laundry for guests to use. FOOD: We don't like to spend too much money on food so the fact that it has a food court was great for us. My faverite was the Marinara Spegetti pasta with prawns at around $12 inclusive of tax was excellent, it usually costs over $20 at home to buy the same type of food! Considering we're at a themepark resort, I thought that was really good value, but you can chose the type of pasta, sauces, prawns or chicken and what vegs you want and its the same price. Ofcourse, there's pizza and roasts etc there but I was very happy with my prawn pasta so didn't try anything else there. Overall, after staying here I don't think I'll stay anywhere else next time we come to Orlando, when we left the hotel to stay at another hotel near universal (to do universal parks) it could not compare and as my partner said, the pixie dusts have gone (as soon as we left Disney) and back to reality!", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cClean, neat, average - like a Super 8 Motel near Disney\u201d", "Author": "SFKSAW", "ReviewID": "UR126059239", "Content": "Maybe we are spoiled - maybe we are jaded, but after staying at a variety of Disney on-site properties we have to declare this one to be the least interesting.

We will definitely go back to Orlando but will spend a better way our money. Universal area in Orlando was very hardly hit by the economic crises. Disney is so far the only company that seems to be spared by this crisis. Don't expect deals or rebates at Disney, they are even full in low season. We were impressed by the number of tourist at Disney, all parks were packed with tourist like a can of sardine. The only way to get some sort of \u201cimpression of a deal\" is to book your holidays 5-6 months in advance (like we did). A similar hotel room that has a real view cost $50 on I-Drive North: Best Western Plus. So this hotel at $220 is really expensive. In addition Waldorf Astoria discounts its huge rooms for $230 ! We stayed in room 413 a remodeled room (with water view +30$ but no real view) still smelling new. The plastic smell is due to use of a large quantity of cheap Chinese plastics everywhere in the room. The room was clean, it had a bad view. The decoration of the room is nice (all plastics) However the furniture in the room is very basic. We lived like homeless people in a shelter. All of our belongings were stored in plastic bags during 4 days. There is only 2 and half beds in the room. There is no place to put your clothing! Don't expect much and you won\u2019t be disappointed. Since the bus service is not running very well, the resort is far from everything. It took us as much as 2 hours commuting per day to get to and back from Magic Kingdom!! After 2 days, we ended up using our rental car to travel. So the Hoper option to change Park the same day. Basically you don't have ANY advantages to stay on site! Commute is slow, Lines are long and slow to get into parks, Fast passes are available to everyone, you even pay more $$ for food as the off resort guests!!! That's being said if you want still stay on site here is the guide how to spend you money wisely (This is something that Disney don't want you to know). THE LITTLE SECRETS OF DISNEY RESERVATIONS: Disney wants you to buy as much as unnecessary things in advance as they can sell to you. The online booking system was built to take your money and mix up your mind. It was not built to explain Disney in detail. The online system is a brain washing system to take your money! Believe me, I am an experienced traveler. The entire Disney holiday system could be explain on 3 pages : Hotel, Park Ticket and Meal Plan. PARKS AND TICKETS: All parks have 3-4 times more shops than rides. LOL. This is ridiculous. MAGIC KINGDOM: We were able to do 90% of the park in one day. It was full of tourists but still enjoyable because of its size. Don't hesitate to take a little 4 years old girl to this park. It will be her princess dream. EPCOT : It is like a huge commercial fair/exposition for $80. Only a very few rides (Am I right 9 rides ?). Basically it is a walk around the world's finest shops. An endless succession of shops and restaurants but it is spectacular. Maybe we will come back here. Actually my 6 years old daughter loved Epcot more than Magic Kingdom ?!. Maybe because she saw more animals at Epcot than at Animal Kingdom ! LOL HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS: Again a few rides a lot of shops but nothing really interesting. If you have been at Universal studios, it will be disappointing. Fast passes are all given out by 11AM in low season !! ANIMAL KINGDOM: Are there any animals ? It was so crowded (300% more folks that it can take). that we only managed to do/see the African section on a Monday !!! This park can't handle tourist visiting it. It is a spectacular place (Kilimanjaro and Tree of life) but again it is an endless succession of shops and waiting lines. You better go to Sea World. The best deal regarding Disney tickets is the 7 days base ticket even if you only go 5 days to the parks !! Dont try to beat the system you will only spend more money. Kids and adults won't walk more than 4-6 hours per day, even if you are a triathlon champion. FOOD AND MEAL PLAN: We had the Dining Plus meal plan for $56 per day. Count my dollars, if I had paid one by one each meal: A snack $4 + Fast food meal $15 + Meal with service $34 = $53 Hey Disney your food plan was more expensive: LOL One advice don't get the meal plan but buy the food as you go. The food on site at Disney is very good. I have nothing to say but good world about what is available. The only advantage of the Dining plus plan is that it will force you to taste and visit different restaurants. We loved the Boma and Cafe may buffets. Best deal for your money. Anyhow if you plan to go to a Disney restaurants book as early as 5-6 months in advance ! (Including buffets !!) Lines are HUGE at restaurants even if you have a reservation. Basically the meal plan is a set of vouchers for each meal. You can use one by one each meal vouchers and snack vouchers. For instance at noon don't take a meal for all family members (unless your body mass index above 30). 1 or 2 meals is enough for 3 ! It doesn't count what time of the day you take your vouchers. Some high end restaurants require 2 vouchers per person per meal (Like the Cinderella castle restaurant). Don't hesitate to ask questions from Disney staff and don't pay for extras! Our favorite place at Disney was the Boardwalk area. A nice trip to Disney but I will need a week to recover from the exhaustion. I would rather spend $3000 on an all inclusive resort in the Caribbean than going back to Disney again. However I did this trip for my daughter. Obviously Disney did a very good marketing job.

We now have children (4 and 2) and this was our first time back to Disney property with them. This was our first taste of the Port Orleans area (French Quarter or Riverside). We arrived on Februay 27th and immediately were bogged down by a resort wide reservation outage, that I was told had been out since 0600 that morning. We arrived at 1230 and were without rooms until it all got cleared up approximately at 4pm that day. That added some stress to our trip I had not expected at all. We were all dressed for a winter morning in the Northeast and it was in the 80s in Orlando. We probably should have packed a change of clothes in our carry ons. We ended up exploring the grounds for several hours. When we did receive a room I was told we were upgraded to a two queen bedroom with river view and stayed in the Acadian House (building 80). Though we did face the river, a giant tree actually blocked our second floor's window's view of the river. I was okay with it as I never really imagined my family would sit at the window wacthing the river while at Disney World! The room was a good size by Disney standards and held the two queen beds, a breakfast nook table with two chairs, a bureau that held the flat screen television and a small dorm fridge. There was a single night stand between the two beds. The bathroom was separated from the living space by a closeable curtain. It contained two mirrors and two sinks. The toilet and shower was behind a door. There was no closet, but an area was available next to the sinks with rod and hangars. My two year old son required a pack n' play which we received from the staff. We managed to squeeze the pack n' play into the bathroom next to the sinks in order to draw the curtain and put him to bed earlier than my wife, my daughter and I. Some PO Riverside rooms have a trundle bed or murphy bed for children. Mine did not. My daughter slept in one of the queen beds and we slept in the other. The beds were a firmer mattress than we were accustomed to, but after a couple tiring days of parks, we didn't care anymore. Wireless internet was available free of charge. This hotel was not listed as a Disney property with free wireless, but it had it none the less. We enjoyed it for making last minute dinner reservations. The signal wasn't the greatest, but it worked. The acreage of the property is quite expansive. If there was any \"con\" to the resort it would be that. After walking the parks all day, the walk from my bedroom to the main building to refill my resort mug seemed awfully far. Coffee was available in the room, but it was not great. So every morning I'd trudge to the main building to get my coffee and bring it back to the room. We tried the cane fishing on the river and my daughter loved it. We also enjoyed the quiet pool next to Building 80. We never used the \"loud pool\" on the island. We saw many people using the horse and buggy for rent, but never did ourselves. In hindsight, I wish we had. Movies were played outdoors between Buildings 90 and 95, always starting at 8pm. That was fun to watch for a short while before bed.

First of all when checking we were greeted by do you want the good news or the bad news that is the good was we were at Disney and the bad was the System was down and therefore we could not check in, but as a consulation they would give us tickets to the parks (which had already been paid for). As we waited for 3 plus hours not once did anyone (management) announce what the progress was as there was many many people waiting in the lobby. After 3 and 1/2 hours waiting we decided to go to the Magic Kingdom and upon our return about 9:30pm went to check in. The receptionist proceeded to check us in as nothing had happened. I had requested a 1st floor room and was assigned a 2nd floor room. When I told him we had already given all the required information he looked it up and proceeded to show us where the room was on the map sending us on our way. Since we had the dinning plan we were told to pay for our meals and we would be re-payed if we brought our reciepts. Proceeding to the concierge I was asked if I wanted room credit on the account but since the trip had been all paid for in full I requested cash which seemed to confuse them and a supervisor had to be called to approved. The transaction complete it was now 10:30pm as we set out to find our room. On our two previous visit I always booked a stardard room and stayed at the Magnolia side but this time we were sent to Aligator Bayou. As we wandered around in circles late at night trying to find our rooms and following the signage for over 1/2 hour. (the signage is confusing and inaccurate) we finally found our room overlooking the parking lot. (this would have been great if we had a car) and as far away from the lobby, and food court as one could get. I returned to the front desk to complain and was told that they had reclassified the roooms and that all the stardard rooms are facing the parking lot (too bad).I notified the supervisor how misleading the signage was and how one sign for the lobby, ole man island and lodges 1-14 would take you directly away from them to he parking lot, he replied that he would have the engineers check it out. I meet other equally confused.and the sign was never changed. The room is nothing special,bed frames made of logs, the faucet handle fell off, houskeeping did not leave any regular coffee after the first days supply, ice bucket was never emptied,shower faucet dripped, and the room not really cleaned. Overall this was a disappointing experience as this resort seems to be going down hill. It would have been appropiate to have some transportation (golf carts) to transport guest that were incovienced by the check-in system being down and returning after dark to their rooms. I agree with other posters that the buses are always packed and standing room only to this resort with longer lines, (probably because all the park busses except the Magic Kingdom serve both the Frencah Quarter and Port orleans) I will offer that if you are a mobile senior as we are, you must either pony up the extra $25.00 per night for a perfered room (what ever that is) or find a better resort.

No frills but clean though the hair dryer was terrible (if you have alot of hair, bring your own). Tip for travel: if you are in building 90 or 95 you can walk to South Depot at POR but if the line is long for the POR bus, you can take the French Quarter bus and walk over - follow the river path then cut up and across the bridge (the one that you drive over - so up the grass hill). We were there in same amount of time as from South Depot. Would we stay again? We agreed yes, of we had friends with us or had more \"adult\" things to do (like drink service at the pool, etc) or could make our own fun with friends.

I have numerous complaints and some are only minor and some may not even be their fault but it impacted my overall experience nonetheless. First off, we arrived at a little past midnight and the check in line was pretty long. There were four people working at the front desk, but the process seemed painfully slow for some reason. We didn't get to our room until after 1am b/c of the wait to check in. Then in the room the doorknob for our bathroom was broken, on both sides. The ring was separated from the door on both sides and was slightly annoying. The light to the actual bathroom took awhile to \"warm up\" so midnight bathroom breaks were a little hard to navigate. The water pressure in the shower was HORRIBLE. The sinks had way more pressure, to the point that I considered washing my hair in there, haha. The pillows on the bed were also pretty bad. I laid my head on it and sank all the way through and felt like I had NO support on my head/neck. Made sleeping a little less comfortable that's for sure. The cleaning was not very good either, there were things on the floor that we had not brought w/ us (and no way we tracked them in). Also where the sinks were they never left us any hand soap, just facial soap. Not sure why a place like Disney would not give you handsoap outside a bathroom, but they never did. A few other quick thoughts for people thinking of staying here, the buses to go to the theme parks seem to be always be packed and running VERY sporadic. When leaving a park expect to wait in the longest line for a bus, not sure why but every other \"resort\" seems to have a short line or none at all. We spent a lot of time standing on bus rides to and from the parks. Also the food prices in the quick restaurant were very pricey for what you got, but that is common in Disney (and the water tastes odd, probably so you'll buy a bottled water). I think next time we will spend a little more money and stay at one of the resorts on the monorail line (Contemporary, Polynesian, Grand Floridian, etc).

The food court food is wonderful! From check-in to check-out, we never encourntered one staff member who wasn't polite, friendly and knowledgeable.

We were in building 36, which is about as far from the main building as you can get and it took us eight minutes to get from our room to the food court--who can complain about eight minutes out of your day!! It was a wonderful walk in the morning. If you have small children or have walking difficulties, request a room in one of the buildings that are closer to the main building.

There was 6 of us in our group, my family (husband and 2 small kids) and my parents. We were in the Magnolia Bend Mansions. Loved Disney Port Orleans for many reasons. What I loved the most was that it's a nicer resort than the value resorts and that alone makes it easier to come back to the resort in the middle of the day for a break from the parks and to come back at the end of the day. The boat to Downtown Disney is a nice alternative to the busses. My daughter thought it was great. I've read mixed reviews about the bus transportation for Port Orleans Riverside, but I thought it was just fine. The busses do rotate where they start and finish on the resort, but for the most part they start at the South Depot. So if you want to make sure you get a seat on the bus, go to the south depot. Sometimes going back to the resort from the park, the bus would stop at French Quarter, and then go to Riverside. But they are so close together, it really didn't tack on that much more time. The main pool is wonderful. The water was nice and warm, except the kiddie pool was kind of cold, but my kids didn't seem to mind. The waterslide at the Ol' Man Island is fun for kids and even the adults. We did not eat at Boatwrights but did eat at the quick service restaurant a few times. A great selection of food that tasted good. The salad bar part was great. The only thing I thought it lacked was bagels/muffins/pastries out during the day. We like to pick those types of things up in the day and eat breakfast in our rooms. Loved that they had the zuper movies at night. This was a nice way to end our day. My kids are young, so we don't keep them out late at the parks, like many parents do- trying to cram in as much as possible. My goal is quality time, not quanity time at Disney. So having the movies in the evening and the boat ride to Downtown is great because it's something to look forward to in the evening for the kids. Our room was not one of the recently refurbished ones, however it was still a nice room. Beds were not the most comfortable, but I'm sure once they replace them in their updates, they'll be fine. This was our 3rd trip to Disney in the last 3 years. We've stayed at Pop Century the first 2 times. We will definitely keep going to the moderates. If you're wondering if it's worth the extra money to go to the moderates....I'd say definitely. Maybe not for your 1st trip because then you're just doing the parks all day every day.

At an evening check-in, there were no bell-men available, so we decided to take a map and stroll to our room. NUMBER ONE PROBLEM: The map for Riverside has many buildings, but does not list their name or number. The desk clerk drew a line to Magnolia Bend and said \"It's just over the bridge\". There is alot \"over there\" We wandered around trying to find the right building for a good 1/2 hour. We stopped a housekeeping person who, a) could not speak English, b) could not direct us to our room & c) had no means of communicating with the front desk. We were schlepping back to the front desk, when we flagged down a bell man, who grudgingly deigned to take us, where he unceremoniously dropped our bags at the back of our building, said \"It's up those stairs\" and drove away. This is the biggest complaint about Riverside - true lack of customer service. There are just too many lodging options not to have good personnel at a Disney Property. The property itself is beautiful - Gone With the Wind facades facing a meandering stream. If you are spending time at your resort, this is a nice one. You can rent a boat, kayak, bike, surrey, or just walk the shaded paths. The main pool is busy & noisy with kid activities throughout the day, but the large pool in Magnolia Bend is relatively quiet and uncrowded. It's nice to take the boat to Downtown Disney, but if it rains/storms you will have to rely on the bus system, as the boats won't run. Food was just so-so in both the Food Court & Boatwrights, but you do have a small fridge in the room for leftovers. The Disney Magical Express is one reason to stay on property - no worries getting to and from the airport, and the resort will store your bags until you depart. Transport to Disney properties is also frequent and fast. They drop and pick you up in front of the attractions. Rooms are nicely appointed, beds comfy, but skip the 'water view' unless you are spending a lot of time in the room.

We do travel often so our comparison may be driven by an overall experience rather than a disney one. This was our second stay at a Disney resort for the Disney Princess Half Marathon. We previously stayed at the All Stars Movie Resort last year. The resort is beautiful and the layout is nice. We stayed in building #95 Parterre and felt that although it was a distance from the main lobby it was a nice to be away from all of the resort traffic. We had been told that we would have a riverside view room however when we checked into our room it was a view of the back, which didn't matter since we were hardly in our room. I would have to check if we were charged extra for this view or not. The room itself was tastefully decorated but was not spotless clean, since there was human hair in the drawers of the dresser (didn't put our clothes in there after seeing this) and there was a stray button by the refridgerator which made me wonder if a vaccum was used at all in the room. The comforters on the bed were worn and there were a few stains on them. As with any hotel, I am not convinced that comforters are ever cleaned. Housekeeping did come each day and made cute animal towel arrangements and made the room tidy, however the stray button stayed on the floor our entire visit until I picked it up and threw it away. The restaurants were average, and the service was fast and the staff friendly. The dining area was clean. Keep in mind that there are lots of kids running around so you need to be careful making your way to a table. We used the water taxi to Downtown Disney and the Bus to get to the parks. Convenient but time consuming. For the Expo for the Race packet pick up we took a taxi because it would require us to take 3 buses to get to the ESPN Center and that seemed not the best use of our time. With all said, the resort is pleasant and is well cared for. Not sure if our room is one of the remodeled ones that are referred to in the previous reviews. In comparison to the All Stars Resort this place is far better and worth the extra money. It is quiet and comfortable.

We just came back today, so it's fresh in my mind as well. So here's the good and not too good: This is considered by Disney to be a \"moderate\" level resort. No problems checking in until I asked for late check-out the next day. My wife was running the Disney Princess Half-Marathon this weekend and we needed the extra time. I thought the check-in lady would certainly understand our need, but she acted like I was asking for the moon- however, we did get the late check-out after her initial few minutes of annoyance display. She was nice otherwise, well pleasant at least, though a bit impersonal. (Remember, Mickey, a smile goes a long way when customers are paying top-dollar!!) I've only had a problem checking in one other time at a Disney Resort a few years ago, so I know this is not the norm for Disney. Our building was in the Alligator Bayou section, but our room was not one of the renovated rooms at Riverside- you can actually check the renovation schedule for all their resorts on-line to see which buildings have been renovated at your resort- and you have to ask for those rooms early! We arrived at the room and I immediately noticed two things- there was a big window cleaner spray bottle in one of our sinks, evidently forgotten by house (or MOUSE) keeping, and there was no shampoo or soap in the bathroom area(!). Now, this is probably no big deal to many people, but I go nuts for the high-quality Disney Resort shampoos and soaps, that's one of the things I like about staying at Disney! I called for some and they came up and gave us a treasure trove of soaps to make up for it. All is forgiven. The room, again, was not one of the renovated ones so yes, it did have that dated Brady Bunch feel to it. The picture on the wall was dated \"1980\" and I'm sure it has been in that one spot all these years. The big square yellowing plastic smoke detector (or whatever that electronic box of yesteryear was) on the wall was off-kilter, looking like a picture hung crookedly. The safe was impossible to find, here's the secret- it's behind the curtain in the sink area. Challenge one of your kids to find it and see how long it takes! I had to call downstairs because I actually thought our room didn't have one! The safe itself is very, very, very small. Did I mention small? It had enough room for my wife's small purse and my car keys- that's about it. The shower looked dated, you know the look, but the two sinks were very clean and having two was nice. The room itself, with two beds, looked generally worn and I can understand why Mickey finally decided to renovate these units. The only modern amenities were a flat-screen tv and small refrigerator. The beds actually made noise when I sat on them, like they were creaky old men waiting to be retired. The carpets were not that clean, you know after several years you just can't get all the dirt out. Ceiling fan was dusty- older a/c unit under the window was touchy with the controls- in sum the room needed renovation and I'm glad Mickey is working on it. (I think Port Orleans French Quarter (next door) has all been renovated, so keep that in mind.) Port Orleans Riverside offers a great pool with slide, and the pool was heated for those cool Florida winter mornings. Poolside bar, kids pool, and small play area. Also marshmallow roasting. As usual, the on-site restaurants have excellent breakfast, lunch and dinner options. Super food at Disney. The great thing about Port Orleans (Riverside or French Quarter)- you can take a cool boat ride down the river to Downtown Disney. Or, you can take a bus anywhere to any Disney resort or theme park. Absolutely no driving required. If you want to take the great monorail, you'll have to stay somewhere else like the Polynesian (my FAVORITE Disney Resort), Grand Floridian, or Contemporary Resort.

Now, as for Port Orleans Riverside, I was very pleasantly surprised. It wasn't more than a two or three hundred more for a week than All-Star and was many times better. The rooms are modern and clean. The beds are adequate, but not awesome. The grounds are very well done and meticulous. The quick service food is better than most resorts (I was addicted to the made to order pasta bar. Very good). I didn't try the sit down restaurant, as I save my credits for the really good places at the parks. The check in and out was pretty good. It is not too far of a bus ride, as opposed to All-Star, which is a nightmare. It is almost worth an extra grand to stay at The Polynesian, just for the monorail service. You learn to hate the busses, especially after several nights of over crowded buses after the parks close.

After reading some of the negative reviews, I was a bit hesitant about staying at Riverside, however my husband and I were pleasantly surprised. We absolutely loved Riverside. The grounds are beautiful and we were in one of the renovated rooms, which was very clean and nicely updated. As mentioned by other reviewers, the resort is LARGE and will require a lot of walking, but you're at Disneyworld and so it is to be expected. The resort is much quieter than the All Star resorts, Pop Century etc., which is a big plus for us because with a 5 year old the parks are stimulating enough and we liked the \"quiet time\" at the resort. The pools are large and a lot of fun for children. We also read reviews regarding the buses being late, not frequent enough etc., however we never had an issue. The buses ran smoothly and we never had to wait more than 15 minutes (both to and from the parks) and we also were there during a peak time. The buses did get very crowded on the way home and they tend to pack the people in, but the bus ride is only 15 minutes long and so it really wasn't a big deal. It is much easier to bus rather than drive to the parks. My only complaint is that there is not a closet in your room, just a rack near the sinks, but is spacious enough. My husband and 5 year old daughter had plenty of room. The dining room had your typical quick service Disney food, nothing outstanding. It is definitely worth getting the Disney Dining Plan to make everything relatively hassle-free. The ladies in the dining room were not the most friendly and moved VERY SLOWLY, but we've found this to be the attitude of many of the quick service restaurants at the Disney parks, but in my opinion you're there for the Disney experience and not the food.

The pool is outstanding (even though we didn't use it). The gift shop is one of the largest and well-stocked resort shop I've yet visited. The River Roost bar was hoppin' every night. The quick service restaurant had a decent variety of food. There is hair wrapping, a horse-drawn carriage ride, a playground for kids, and boat service to Downtown Disney. If I have to quibble, I will only say that I think the bed linens are extremely uncomfortable (stiif sheets and pillows; scratchy horse blanket quilts) and the bus service is a bit sluggish and ALWAYS crowded.

Granted, I am used to staying at the Wilderness Lodge so I guess my expectations were a little high although this time our budget was not. We had an upgraded room with two queens and a bathroom separated from the sinks by a door which came in very handy having 2 adults and 2 teens in the same room. Two could primp (two sinks and mirrors) while the other was taking a shower. Made getting ready in morning easier. The best thing about the resort was it was very quiet. The worst thing was the restocking of the soda/coffee island in the eatery. By the early evening all the lemonade was just water and in the morning the coffee was very watered down. This happened all through the week. Rooms were clean and the extras really catered to little ones but for teens it was, as my 17 year old stated \"boring\". Because of this we just used the place to sleep. The \"mansions\" all looked alike and the pool was just a big pool, nothing special. The grounds are pretty and there is a boat that takes you to Downtown Disney which was nice. The bus route seemed to take forever to get to one place or another. Again, I am used to staying at hotels closer to the action. I did not like the entertainment in the piano bar. Everyone there seemed liked they were having a blast but it just wasn't my cup of tea. I found the piano player to be a bit screechy and doing the conga line well... So in a nut shell: The Good: Price, it's quiet, separation in bathroom, scenery, staff The Bad: Boring for teens, far from attractions with long bus rides, no wow factor to resort. If you want a really memorable place especially for teens, save up and stay at the Beach Club or Yacht Club. They are right on the boardwalk and walking distance to Epcot, mini golf, great pools, even a beach. My teens were very envious of the place.

The first horrible experience that I ever experience that we had was dinner service at Boatwright's Dining Hall. The service was horrid and the food was so-so. The other negative times at the resort involved the food court. Now, I understand, food courts are not expected to be quiet peaceful places. This one however, I think can be blamed on layout... you'll see. It's crazy and subdivided, enjoy taking a stroller in there btw, and don't even think about a double. it was insane.

The buses were prompt and it took no longer than 30 minutes from arriving at the bus stops to getting to any of the parks. We also took advantage of the downtown disney river boat which was convenient but could be cold coming back at night across the open waters.

This resort seems to be the one moderate resort that everyone overlooks. Well, my girls and I don't even look at other options after our last stay - this resort is fantastic!! When we arrived we were checked in by very friendly staff. When I made my reservations I had requested adjoining rooms (my mom came with us) in one of the mansions. When we arrived we noticed we had adjoining rooms but in one of the Bayou buildings. We asked (NICELY - that's the ticket people!) and were moved into Parterre Place without issue. The Room: clean and comfortable, everything worked and great housekeeping with towel animals for my girls (note: we tipped every day - you get what you pay for!). Only two complaints - double beds made for close quarters sleeping (that said we slept well). The other is there was no wifi which seemed odd considering this is a resort in Disneyworld! On our next stay I might consider the extra few bucks for a Royal Room for the queen beds. We had a view of the parking lot which didn't bother us because we only went to the room to sleep and change. That said, it was the prettiest parking lot I've seen LOL. Food: We only used the buffet for breakfasts and the odd supper. The menu didn't change much but the food was good, hot, and enough selection to keep my girls, my mom, and me happy. No complaints - if you want five star food that changes dramatically everyday at a buffet, this isn't the resort for you (and I'm not sure what resort would be for you). For the rest of our meals we ate in the parks. ** If you are planning a trip and thinking about getting a meal plan I highly recommend the Deluxe Dining Plan (3 meals + 2 snacks per person per day). This pretty much gave us the freedom to eat wherever we wanted and eat whatever we wanted, including dinner at Cinderella's castle! It's not cheap but I didn't have to carry gobs of cash - made our lives very easy and I'll definitely have it on my next trip! Pools: the main pool on the island is usually pretty crowded and busy. My girls went a couple times but weren't real thrilled by it - they didn't dislike it they just didn't find it worth the walk. The pool right next to Parterre Place was usually empty and became the pool of choice. Extras: I highly recommend renting one of the little two person \"speed\" boats (they don't go fast LOL). An hour is around 50 dollars and you can zip down to Downtown Disney, circle the bay and back in that time. Great way to spend an afternoon! Also, an evening horse drawn carriage ride is a big hit for my girls and it was pretty cheap too - just make sure you make a reservation, they book up fast! The grounds are amazing!! It was really a treat to take such a beautiful stroll first thing in the morning to go to breakfast. Even coming home at night with two bagged kids and a grandma was made better by such a nice walk. Bus service was fantastic!! Never waited more than 15 minutes for a bus and they are all pretty much direct runs to whatever park you are going to. Yes, you might circle your resort for other stops but it's a bus, not a taxi. They were always clean and comfortable. Yes, I stood probably half of the time but I believe in letting women and children sit first (I wish most men thought this way, kind of embarassing but that's another rant) and it wasn't a hassle. The drivers were very polite and didn't drive like maniacs which made standing fine. Overall, my satisfaction with this resort has meant we will be making a reservation here for Easter 2013. Yes, you can find cheaper but for what you get, the dining plan, the transportation, the early entrance hours, it's all worth it!", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!!\u201d", "Author": "anemales", "ReviewID": "UR123982764", "Content": "First let me start off by saying this is our 5th trip to WDW in the last 7 years. Our first in 2004 was at the Polynesian and the next 3 were at the Animal Kindom Lodge Jambo House (2006, 2008 & 2009.) I have written reviews for both deluxe hotels of which we loved both. Since we wanted to mix it up and save a little money at the same time, we looked into this hotel (POR.) After looking at some photos of a trundle bed before we booked the hotel, I was a bit skeptical but we still gave it a shot anyway. Let me just say the grounds are just beautiful. We had a room in the Alligator Bayou in Building 28. There were 5 of us on this trip (2 adults with a 17, 16 & 12 yr old) thus we needed a room with a trundle bed. Although the bed feels like your sleeping on the floor, my daughter didn't mind sleeping on it every night even though she didn't have to. The room was clean, quite and exactly what we expected. There were two nearby small pools which was very welcomed considering it was 90 degrees for about 23 hours a day. We rented a Pontoon boat one day and took it to Downtown Disney in which we all loved it. We were all satisfied with the food court and it's menu. One drawback is the large layout of the hotel. It could be a bit of a hike to your room after a long day at the parks and confusing at nights in the dark. Also, there are 4 bus stops and buses can get crowded at times. Another drawback is the lack of a decent restaurant. The one sit down restaurant there was poor at best which explains why it was always empty. Overall we loved our stay there at the POR Resort and wouldn't hesitate in staying there again. In fact we are planning to go again in December 2012 and this resort along with AKL are our two places of preferrence. I hope this info was helpful.

So, I have a pretty negative attitude going in - it's very inconvenient for business travelers. While the building layout is very pretty (it's basically an apartment complex, not a single hotel building), you will be doing some walking if you don't have a car. My assumption is that as in a motel, you would check in once, and then park near your room. At the conference, the buses for the Swan and Dolphin left from the main building, so you had to add that walking time into your schedule. The rooms are fine - I had two double beds (are there no king beds available?), and the room was a reasonable size, especially for one. The table was near the (dead) wired Internet connection, but I was using Wi-Fi. There was a small flat-screen TV, but I never used it. The pillows were a bit squishy for my taste. The rooms feel old, not in the \"Mark Twain on the river\" sense, but just like it was built a while ago, and never updated. I know it's part of the motif, but modernization can be a good thing. I did appreciate (but didn't need) the ceiling fan - it's one of the first hotel rooms with a ceiling fan. It reminds me of a basic motel - they're not to the level I expect from business travel, but they are adequate. The Wi-Fi connections can be spotty, which is an issue if you need connectivity. The wired connection in my room was dead. Also, my room did not have a safe, so I took my laptop with me a lot - some of my colleagues mentioned they had safes. I did have a mini-fridge (would prefer a mini-bar.) This was the first trip where I used the free water taxis, and they are a very useful way to get around the resort areas - you do have to make connections from time to time, but those are relatively quick. You will find there are some areas where it is actually faster to walk than use the taxi service (in Downtown Disney, we walked to our restaurant rather than waiting for the next water taxi to go to the next stop - a ten-minute boat ride was replaced by a five-minute walk. You will find some distances are magnified greatly when you have to drive or use the water taxi, because the roads are not in a straight line.) I didn't use the regular bus service, since the conference had its own buses. I have never tried the \"real\" restaurant, but the quick service cafe (pizza, sandwiches, desserts) is fine. The $15 unlimited refills mug can be worth the money if you remember to carry it with you, or don't mind going to your room to collect it before meals. I would see people with handfuls of mugs heading into the cafe in the morning, probably for coffee. The food seems a bit pricey, but it is convenient, and it is open relatively late (I think it was open until 11pm.) I'm not sure if there is any food delivery to the rooms - I did have a brochure left on my table for a non-Disney pizza delivery one day, so I'm assuming not. The bar is very quiet on nights the piano player is not performing. When he is there, don't plan to have any quiet conversations! If you are into sing-alongs, it is a lot of fun. If you are trying to have a quiet drink, it's not the best place, but it is the only bar I've found on the property. The business conference mindset is completely different from the vacation mindset, so that may be part of my issues. However, I do think it could be a bit more business-friendly without compromising the vacation flavor.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Curitiba, PR", "Title": "\u201cPort Orleans Resort\u201d", "Author": "Walter D", "ReviewID": "UR123614695", "Content": "I have been staying in Port Orleans Riverside in the last 15 years, since it was named Dixie Landings.

I then realized that the first room was never renovated and they were trying to see who would just stay and deal with it and not complain! That upset me to know they were doing that....they should have said something about not all rooms being updated or something when we booked or when we checked in. After that was all over with we finally began to enjoy our trip! The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and green, the river runs through the middle and you can catch a boat to Downtown Disney which was really cool! We did that one night when we were going over to Fulton's Crab House for dinner, which is definintely worth going to! The bus system was a little disappointing around the hotel but we did use it some of the time. But we also took a lot of cabs because it could take and hour or more sometimes to get to where we were going. I don't think it's really worth renting a car but taking a cab for $10-15 at night to get back in 15 minutes from where ever we were was well worth it instead of taking the trek on the buses! Also they really need a system to get to other hotels from your hotel...Unless a hotel is on the same bus line as yours you can not get there with out an hour or two of travel time...you have to go to a park then get a bus or monorail or boat to whatever hotel you are going to...and if you don't have a park hopper pass and need to walk through a park to get to transporation this all can be a big hassel! Our family was staying at the Yacht Club Resort and it was super annoying trying to get over to them without a taxi! I learned for next time to check that before booking! I do want to compliment 2 wonderful people at the concierge ....I wish I knew their names because they made our last day a very happy one...they were super sweet! I was so afraid to go down there cause the girl that was there the night before was so nasty to me but they made me forget how mean she was cause they were so delightful! I wish I had talked to them in the beginning of the trip...when I told her what I needed and said I'm not sure if you can do this...her answer was \"Of course I can help you! This is Disney...everything is easy!\" It was wonderful! All in all I would stay at this resort again since I have the knowledge of what to expect and I know to ask for a renovated room! It's much better and closer to everything then staying all the way at the all stars. We enjoyed our stay and all the parks were so great! This is a reasonable price for what you are getting...oh and the pool was heated and also had a hot tub open late which was great after a long day of walking!", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NH", "Title": "\u201cNice place to stay\u201d", "Author": "mjczoey", "ReviewID": "UR123352992", "Content": "We stayed there in Dec for my almost three year old's first Disney trip.

Without question, this beautifully maintained property is one of the best values you will find at WDW. I just have to laugh any anyone giving this gorgeous property a negative review. After our six day stay in early December 2011, my entire family was in love with this hotel and couldn\u2019t wait to return. Yes, the rooms are a little small, but my family of 5 did quite well. This is one of the few Disney properties that will allow 5 per room, with one child needing to sleep in the trundle bed. This sure beats paying hundreds of dollars for an extra room. And besides, if you\u2019re spending most of your vacation in a hotel room, you may be missing out on a lot of Disney fun. I have to say that in my experience of staying at WDW properties (five in the last ten years), you do not here a peep from other guests. You would almost think you are the only family staying at a given property it is so quiet. The grounds are simply gorgeous and immaculate. Disney still keeps all of it\u2019s parks and properties spotless. Every trash can looked like it is brand new. And in today\u2019s economy, you might excuse Disney for needing to cut back on keeping everything spotless, but to their credit, their attention to detail concerning cleanliness has not wavered. We were fortunate to have the Disney Dining plan included (at no additional charge) with our package. So, if you can get Disney to include this to your package, for your entire stay you will not have to look at how much any meal costs, and you will eat like kings. The plan was a little confusing to both myself and many of the cast members at times, but is so worth it.. The food court at POR was terrific, and if you can\u2019t find anything you like, shame on you. We ate either lunch or dinner perhaps five times at the POR food court and found a nice variety. The place is packed about an hour before the parks open, so make sure to get up early enough to either grab a quick muffin or breakfast, in time to arrive at the parks well before \u201crope drop\u201d. You don\u2019t want to rush thru your park experiences, but every minute is precious and you don\u2019t want to sleep in and miss out on any of the parks rides or attractions. It was sunny and in the upper 70s during our stay, and 40 degrees back home. We wanted to enjoy every possible moment of \u201csummer\u201d. We were not big fans of the sit-down restaurant, Boatwrights. The food was average, salty and the service was uneven, at best. The waitress brought my wife the wrong entr\u00e9e, and didn\u2019t clear any of the used dishes. She can call us \u201cSweety\u201d all she wants, but I\u2019d rather she cut out the fake hospitality and get our orders correct. The meal would have cost close to $90 without the dining plan, but was, of course, included with our plan. I\u2019d be really upset if I had to pay that kind of money for that dining experience. But when it\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d, you just move on and learn from it. The main pool area was amazing, with a very nice slide for the kiddies. I\u2019m sure our kids could have spent all day, every day, in the pool. They also have at least three lifeguards intently watching the kids in the pool area. Very comforting, to say the least. Be sure to take the boat ride to the downtown Disney area. This is an attraction unto itself that other properties do not offer. I\u2019m a rather demanding traveler, but can not say enough about our WDW vacation, with POR being a big part of it. I challenge any POR reviewer to say with a straight face that this property is not magical. Yes, I\u2019m sure an occasional reservation is confused, and, incredibly, you may find a microscopic hair on the floor, but all and all, POR will guarantee your WDW vacation to be truly amazing.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Syracuse, NY", "Title": "\u201cTime to update\u201d", "Author": "Elizabethpt", "ReviewID": "UR123293012", "Content": "I was at this resort from 1/5-1/8 for the Disney Marathon.

Even though the room wasn't renovated, it wasn't too bad, just a bit worn. We could have moved to a renovated room after the first night, but the location of our room was really convenient to everything, so we stayed where we were. The grounds are very nice. We only used the main pool once (before it got record-breaking cold). Our kids really enjoyed it and there were a lot of activities going on (music and games) that afternoon. We ate at the Riverside Mill several times. It was easy to grab breakfast from the bakery there the night before to get an early start in the mornings. The pasta bar was a great deal as each serving easily served two of us for $11. The pizza was good, too. Check in was a bit rough. We came in late, but were relieved to see there wasn't too long of a line. However, when we finally got sorted out (our clerk was nice, but was struggling), there was a long line behind us. Not what you want to be doing at 2am. We also weren't charged correctly and our credit card \"dropped\" from our reservation??, so we had to spend 45 minutes of our morning two days later sorting that out (it wasn't due to anything on our end, apparently). The courtesy bus from the airport is nice, but it was a long wait and ride getting to our hotel(including dropping off at all the other resorts first). The bus was over half an hour late picking us up when we left. It was supposed to be a 5:30 am pickup, so it felt like an even longer wait after scurrying to be there on time.

The price seemed crazy through Mears (for a shuttle), but appeared to be the best deal ($75 round trip for four per day). The first day went well using them.

While there are certainly nicer pads out there, this one is good for the price, with plenty of character and tons to do. Disney resorts are expensive, especially during peak periods, but the benefits of staying onsite are numerous. If you're hung up on the price you paid at the Holiday Inn Express in suburban Cleveland for that conference back in September, don't read any further. A Disney resort isn't for you. I'll start with the good: - Good food choices. Everything from filet to turkey dinner to burgers and fries. The make your own pasta bar is good for every taste. Food options might be tough for the vegan traveler; however there *seemed* to be plenty of vegetarian options. - Meandering paths wander through the bayou themed, park like resort. Little bridges travel over streams, and private foot paths lead to several well placed pools; - Grounds are meticulous and clean; - Fantastic feature pool and kiddy pool with poolside activities. Small water slide is perfect for both swimmers and non swimmers. Now the bad - I focus on this aspect not because it was a bad trip, but because these issues may influence where someone else stays. - No elevators. This, by far, is the biggest negative if you are traveling with small children. We traveled with my 2 year old son, who still needs a stroller and is sketchy on stairs. We were in the farthest building from the main dining hall on the 2nd floor farthest from the stair case. I have never stayed at a resort without elevators in my life, so I didn't think to ask. - The resort is huge. It's a 10 minute walk for a fit family from Building 24 to the main dining hall. - Most of the cast members were great, but some were borderline rude. It's the first time I've ever experienced this in a Disney resort. They were no worse than your typical chain hotel, but I expect more from Disney. - The resort is big and buses are busy. Some buses are shared with French Quarter and it may take time to get to and from the resorts. The Animal Kingdom bus is painful, since it's shared with French Quarter, and has a stop at Blizzard Beach. - Again, the buses are busy, so for the love of peanut butter and jelly, leave your sinking BOB jogging stroller at home! I have one, too. I love it, but this ain't the place for it, sister! Get yourself a good lightweight, and leave the jogging one at home. - The people driving the club cars for housekeeping are insane drivers, so keep your toddlers at arms length so they don't get hit on the paths. - The bathrooms are in desperate need of updating. The grout in the tiles is dingy and old, but clean. It's not awful, but I expect better from Disney. This is a great place if everyone in your party can walk on their own.

Within Port Orleans Riverside are two sections with multiple buildings in each section\u2014Magnolia Bend (mansions) and Alligator Bayou. Years ago, when we visited Port Orleans Riverside (not stayed), it was called Dixie Landings and since then I\u2019ve always wanted to stay in one of the mansion buildings. So there was no decision to be made when planning this trip as to which section we wanted within Riverside--it was Magnolia Bend. Note the themed d\u00e9cor in the lobby area\u2014very unusual ceiling fans. Room \u2013 We requested a recently refurbished room on the top floor in the Magnolia Terrace building which is right across from the main area where all the action is and close to an internal bus depot as well. We got our request and got a surprisingly nice view of one of the quiet pools as well (we expected a parking lot or trees view). It took a while to find our room especially since we had to find the elevator with our luggage. (For the duration of our trip, we used the stairs which were closer to our room.) Upon opening the door, we were greeted with a towel-created Mickey on the bed. We carefully moved it to the top of the dresser where it would remain for the rest of our stay. The room was nicely decorated with colors I would not normally choose (greens and blues), but they coordinated nicely with the southern theme of the resort. There were double sink vanities with a hairdryer outside the bathroom which is especially handy in the mornings when you are rushing to start the day. Toiletries provided were less than what we remembered when we last stayed at a Disney resort 8 years ago. Now, only adequate supplies of Mickey soaps and shampoo/conditioner are provided. Our double room was furnished with a flat screen TV on a dresser and a table with 2 chairs with upholstery coordinated to the bedspreads. An oval mirror, riverboat prints, and hanging chandelier over the table completed the look. The refrigerator was handy to store our supply of bottled water and there was a coffeemaker in the room. The hooks and shelf was a nice addition to the closet area since it allowed us to hang wet stuff and bags away from the clothes. The luggage rack was not your standard type, but a cushioned one that looked more like a bench. Never saw scenic headboards like these before\u2014must be custom-made. Beds were very comfortable and provided restful sleep. Riverside Grounds - On our way to the room, we saw a horse-drawn carriage hitched up by the marina ready for rides. It was a nice touch to the southern theme of the resort. (It would be the only time we would see this horse since the rides are only given in the late afternoons to early evening and we were never at the resort at that time.) The grounds are immaculate and the grass always looked freshly mowed. I heard someone comment that he wished someone could come make his lawn at home look like this place. There's even a gazebo to add to the scenery. Since this resort is built along the Sassagoula River, you can take a nice boat ride from the dock here to Downtown Disney making a stop at Port Orleans French Quarter. We did this on our first night just to get in the vacation mood. There is also a lovely riverside path to walk from Riverside to French Quarter. Also by the dock are various watercraft for rental as well as bicycles and surreys for the landlubbers. It may not be apparent when you are actually there, but the main pool is on its own island in the middle of the Sassagoula River and accessible by footbridge from the lobby and from the rooms. There was always music and activity there. Also on that island is the quiet Fishin\u2019 Hole with the catch and release rule. Here you can rent both equipment and bait. Scattered throughout the resort grounds are 5 other quiet pools. There are also self-service laundry facilities which we did not need. We saw the Alligator Bayou section of the resort from across the river, but didn\u2019t venture there due to time constraints and the fact that we were told its theming was a bit swampy which is not our thing. The gift shop, lobby, game room, restaurants and lounges are all connected in a long building. Nicest and most helpful cast members in Fulton\u2019s General Store (gift shop). This store is very large for a hotel gift shop. The game room is called the Medicine Show Arcade and it\u2019s not quite as large as I would expect. They utilize tokens for the games. Dining \u2013 For food, there is Riverside Mill Food Court, Boatwright\u2019s Dining Hall, and River Roost Lounge connected to the lobby. For those of you wondering, there is no room service, but I understand there is pizza delivery available. In the evening live music emanated from the River Roost lounge and people seem to be having fun in there\u2014we were always too tired to stop by. We also didn\u2019t get to dine in Boatwright\u2019s because we already had all our dinners reserved for the duration of our stay. However, we did have breakfast and lunch at the Riverside Mill. Breakfast was abundant and good with the breakfast platter which included a mini Mickey waffle, but lunch at the pasta station was disappointing. Summary \u2013 Riverside has become one of our favorite Disney resorts and if we were to return, we would definitely stay in Magnolia Bend again. It is not how one would picture a Disney resort, but after a busy and tiring day at the parks, the beauty and serenity of Riverside is most welcoming.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Orange, Florida", "Title": "\u201cJust OK, not terrible.\u201d", "Author": "iamaws", "ReviewID": "UR122986188", "Content": "I stayed at Port Orleans Riverside for only one night.

The bathroom is pretty old. Actually, it reminded me Red Roof in for the most part. Towels were clean, toiletries: just soap and shampoo. There was a fridge and coffee maker in the room. TV is 32\u201d flat screen, but most channels are Disney. Two things that I did not like about this property: 1. It looks close, but actually is far from everything. You need to use a bus, and the buses run with VERY long intervals. Guest service at Epcot told me that they ran every 20 minutes, but I had to wait more than 40 minutes. 2. Check out time is 11 am. Which is really early, in order to get a slightly late checkout I had to speak with several levels of management.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cdisappointed\u201d", "Author": "Posted by a Virgin Holidays traveler", "ReviewID": "UR122937604", "Content": "Arrived on a late flight from San Francisco, check in was poor, was given a map of location of our room, no help with luggage, had two prams with a 2 and 4 year old.

I'm hoping we just stayed at the wrong resort, because it was a horrible experience all around. The room was very small, the beds were uncomfortable, but the worst was the dirty bathroom. There was a ring around the tub and I found a hair in the soap dish. The room was cute, but not small kid friendly. The beds were high up and made to look like they were made from pine trees. I worried that someone would fall and get hurt the entire time. The trundle is small, sits on the floor, and isn't very comfortable even for a small kid. The property is beautiful, and spread out. We made the mistake of taking the boat to downtown disney without checking for our bus stop. On the way back the driver put us off the bus at the wrong stop across the property in the freezing cold. He told us this was our stop, that it was the closest he went to our room. We were dropped off in the dark and completely lost, we finally found our way across the bridge back to our side of the resort, cold and hungry. My husband decided he'd had enough and went to complain about our room and the bus driver. The manager Tracy didn't really seem to care and couldn't get him out fast enough and didn't do anything to fix the situation. We went off property for dinner and for tub cleaner so I could bathe the kids. We started fresh the next day, trying the bus again to Magic Kingdom, but with 4 stops in this resort it takes a while and gets very crowded. It was a challenge holding a baby and 2 year old while standing the entire way. This was our first visit staying on property, and the magic we hoped for, was lost the first day.

We have stayed on property many times since our kids were preteens, and now we still go with our grandkids at least annually for the January Disney Marathon Weekend [Four days of managed chaos when 50,000 or more runners, families of runners, volunteers, and unfortunates who unknowingly schedule their visits for the same time invade the parks.]. This year we planned our visit for Port Orleans Riverside and were booked into the Alligator Bayou section. Unlike other sections of the property our room did not have queen beds; we had two double beds and one trundle. The beds were comfortable with good pillows and the two adults and three kids slept fine. However, the room was like the Holiday Inns of the early 70s with the commode and tub/shower in a closeable room while two nice pedestal sinks were in the sleeping area. There is a pullable curtain that adds privacy when needed. Unfortunately, when there is a runner in the family who must get up and out at 3:30 AM for the race, this room layout does not work well. Still, these rooms are VERY quiet, even when they face the heated pool which gets busy at night. These mid-range rooms are booked well over $200 ++ for this weekend, and one must balance the price with the value of being only one mile from the marathon starting line. There is a refrigerator and coffeemaker in each room. The property is huge! Folks have to walk from the registration area to their rooms at night, since there were no bellmen to help. For our section we had to walk thru the food court dragging luggage to get to the walkways; not the efficiency one expects from Disney, masters of que management and productivity efforts. Food in the food court is quite good as are the offerings at the Boatwright Dining Hall. The \"Saloon\" is busy every evening, and very lively with a family-friendly show. Prices for food, beverage, and libation are at levels typical for a resort at this mid-range. There is lots to do for families with older children, but with the under 9 crowd we were limited on property with suitable activities. Staff is Disney friendly and helpful. Complimentary buses to the parks leave from one of four depot areas (north, west, east, and south). At park closing these buses are more than jammed... this property is so big it takes bus after bus to get lodgers home.

The other line was moving fast but everyone had to wait for their info folder to be put together. I am glad we got the refurbished room or otherwise I am pretty sure we would have been unhappy. We got 2 adjoining rooms since we have 4 kids ages 16, 11, 10, and 8. The queen beds were good to have compared to a full. Daily cleaning service was good. I think they made some bunny washcloths but our kids have outgrown those things so no big perk for us. We enjoyed using the Disney transportation but what I read before is definitely true--the Riverside line is always the longest for the return trip back to room at night! We would have to wait through 2 or 3 buses before we could get on sometimes. We didn't mind much as our kids are older and we weren't dealing with toddlers, diaper bags, and strollers. Our oldest child also used the transportation on his own since he loves to hang out in Epoct and catch up with the rest of the family later. He even took his sisters back to the room one day early and took them to the arcade. It was very easy to use. We enjoyed the property but it was a large spread out resort. We stayed in a non-preferred room and didn't mind the 5 or 6 minute walk to the lobby, arcade, and gift shop. We thought it was a pleasant walk. We never used the boat to Downtown Disney so I can't comment on that. We only ate at the quick area not the Boatwright restaurant --lots of options and desserts though. The menu looked good at Boatwrights but not worth a table dining credit. The gift shop was nice and having packages sent to it from the parks for later pick up was very handy. We had the deluxe dining plan and had several reservations. Our kids weren't much into the character meals though. We did the Beach Club breakfast and the Norweigan princess meal. We thought the food was really good overall at our table service meals, but we like to try interesting new food. Boma was our favorite--went there twice! The only fault we found was the size of the kid friendly pool. It was way too small for the size of the resort. We didn't even use it. It was crowded and loud.

As I walked around my first night after check in, I came upon a Gazebo that was lit up with about 25 candles. I watched some guy make sure the candles were lit and then to my surprise, up pulled a horse and buggy, the kind I'm used to seeing in Central Park in NY City, with a couple riding in it. (They have buggy rides and bike surreys to rent) A young couple stopped at the gazebo and the young man got down on one knee to propose. The girl accepted and I couldn't have asked for a more perfect life moment to witness then that. It's more then a magical place and there were other good things to note about this riverside resort. The food lines moved more quickly then any of the other hotels I stayed at. The 10 minute water taxi ride to downtown Disney is another plus as well as the short bus rides to Epcot and Magic Kingdom. This is an automatic pick for our next trip. I'll make sure to book in advance as not to miss out. Well worth a try!!! Please make sure it's the Riverside you book and not the French Quarter!

If you will spend some time in your resort, then by choosing a moderate you get a slightly larger room, a fridge in your room, and nicer pool facilities. Riverside has a main pool area on Old Man Island, which is lovely, but after lunch it becomes very noisy with the kids pool party.

You should be aware the resort is very spread out with a fair walk to most rooms, which may be a bit much after a day in EPCOT! The food court has a very wide range of hot and cold options, and I think it is the best quick service food court in disney world for the food quality and range, but it is a shame that there is just one small bank of fridges for the drinks, which leads to long queues building when a child in front can't decide what drink they want!

I am also a huge Disney fan and have dreamed for years of completing that \"once-in-a-lifetime\" trip. Take this into account as you read the review. About the pics? I just happened to have them. I really was expecting this to be my \"once-in-a-lifetime\" trip, as money is an issue, so I took over 350 pictures during my trip. My digital camera is a life-saver! 1. Your experience will depend upon your attitude. This goes for the whole shebang and not just the resort. If you are excited and willing to experience the \"magic,\" then you will have a great time. If you let every little thing bother you, you won't. 2. When we arrived: we had paid for the trip in full before we got there - hotel stay, theme park tickets, dining plan, everything. The only money we needed to take was spending money. With this said, check-in was a breeze. We went right after Thanksgiving, which all the guidebooks said was the lowest point in the year, so that might also have something to do with it. Everyone was friendly and attentive. The lobby and grounds were beautifully decorated for Christmas. We had to wait until our rooms were ready as we got there before the 3 pm check-in time. Our luggage was stored - for free - and we toured the grounds. We found the two pools - one small hotel pool next to the laundry building - and a bigger pool that had more \"decorations.\" It also had upbeat music playing during the day. There is also a rather nice children's play area next to the bigger pool. My daughter loved it. We also saw the dock where you can take a boat straight to Downtown Disney. Everything was clean and well-maintained. There was some renovations going on in the building next to (the actual building we slept in), but I thought the noise was actually quieter than smaller projects I have heard in my own city; put it like this, we could nap if we wanted to do so. Once our rooms were ready, which was actually quite a bit earlier than 3 pm - we went to the desk, received our room keys, and went to our rooms. We called for our luggage, and it was delivered to our room within fifteen minutes. 3. During the visit: The room stayed very clean with the help of a daily maid. The beds were comfortable, and I loved the sheets. The room was nicely appointed. I thought it was very pretty. The grounds were beautiful. I took quite a few pics of my family out and about on the grounds as they made such a lovely backdrop. Bus Depots- We were very close to one of the bus depots, which was very nice. We never had to wait more than 10-15 minutes for a bus, and that's being stingy. Usually the bus we wanted seemed to pull up as soon as we got there. Boat - You could take a boat straight to Downtown Disney. Look for the hidden Mickey made out of rope underneath one of the bridges! 4. Checking Out: A breeze if you pay for your trip in full before you go. Just pack up all your stuff and walk out. We got to keep the room keys as souvenirs, which I thought was pretty neat. 5. Dining Plan: GET IT! If you're staying at a resort, your opportunities for dining off-site go down unless you rent a car. AND if you rented a car, would you really want to travel off-site to eat every day? We didn't. The dining plan was wonderful. We got the Deluxe because we didn't understand how much food it was going to be. It's more than you can eat, and the portions are very generous. The great thing about the Deluxe is the two snacks per day. We used those for water in the parks. Even with that, we still had 17 snacks at the end of the week unused, and quite a few meals. There was so much food, we usually ate a brunch or just a lunch and a dinner. The cool thing is that you can \"cancel out\" your meal plan. Any unused meal plan items can be traded in the resort quick-service restaurant and the snacks can be traded there or in the gift shop for certain snack items. The gift shop items are the best. Goofy's sour worms. Chip 'n Dale's bag of nuts. Those kind of things. They make great things to bring back for families or friends. With that said, if I ever get to go again, I will not be going with the Deluxe plan. We brought back, literally, a lot of food. There were way more than enough \"Mickey\" rice krispy/chocolate mouse ears for my daughter to bring back one for every student in her class, the teacher, and the teacher's assistant. And we still had some that I was giving away to family and friends. I would rather go for the plan where you get one sit- down, one quick-service, and one snack. That would get us through lunch and dinner (which some of the food from those would be brought back to the room in case someone needed a snack), and let us indulge in a treat that is high-priced in the actual park. I recommend the ice cream cookie sandwich from the Bakery on Main Street in Magic Kingdom. It was so big that my daughter and I couldn't finish ours! My husband could, though! Riverside Mill: There are actually two different places to eat at POR. There is a quick-service part and a sit-down restaurant part. The quick-service has food for everyone. It was delicious, and it was not just fast-food junk. You could make healthy choices. The sit-down restaurant is styled in the Louisiana fashion. The food choices are from that region, and it gave my family a nice chance to try some different cuisine. Alcohol is not included in the dining plan. You have to pay for that out-of-pocket. 6. Tips/Gratuities: The grauities are NOT included in the dining plan. I thought they were, but they aren't. When you sit down, tell the server you're on the dining plan first thing and specify the type. They will help you figure out what you can order; it actually doesn't take long to figure this out on your own. I did notice that service was not quite as fast as I wanted as the sit-down types, but this was my impatience. The sit-down types are expected to be leisurely, and I wanted to explore the parks. I helped speed the process up, though, by ordering everything I wanted in one go and then the next time I saw the waiter, I asked for the receipt. With the dining plan, you just have to sign the receipt so it can be deducted from your meal plan account. There is a line at the bottom telling you the diiferent gratuities you could give. However, I could not tip 18 - 20% on every meal, as the sit-down meals were usually at least $100 at one time, so I generally left about $5 as a tip. I felt bad, as the servers were really great, but money was an issue. One last thing, I did tip the maid five dollars per day. They work hard, and I bet they're one of the lowest paid workers there. 7. The \"Magic\" - The workers at the resort and the parks did a lot of little things that seemed to go unnoticed by the majority of people. One fabulous example was when my family got off the bus from one of the parks during the day, and there was an outline of Mickey, Minnie, and Donald Duck on the concrete. It was so cool! A cast member was standing by watching as all the people just walked by this creation, and he noticed my family's reaction. I thought it was neat, so I took pics. He saw that we were \"open\" to the \"magic,\" and said, \"See, Minnie knew you were coming, so she appeared just for you.\" I told him thank you for drawing the pics, and he said he couldn't accept it because \"it was just the magic. [He] couldn't draw to save his life.\" I then told him to tell the magic maker thank you, It was a lot of those little things over the entire trip - and the big ones - that made it really magical. So keep your eyes open, and look with the heart of a child.

Huge inconvinence since we arrived several hours past (due to traffic) my toddler's nap and she was very upset. Other sidenote: Shuttles are not always every 15-20 mins. We waited 45 mins for a shuttle and missed our reservation for lunch. Try to schedule your shuttle rides 30 mins in advance. Also remember that shuttles pick up other patrons along the way and the total ride could be 30 mins.

One of the highlights of the resort is undoubtably the resort's food court. Definitely the best we've enjoyed at a Disney Hotel. Burgers, chicken and pizza are all good, but the make your own salads and pasta were big hits with us. Pool area is really nice, but does get slightly noisy in the afternoon with the kids pool party. It didn't bother us too much - weather was great (in October) and we spent many happy days here. Pool bar is pretty good, although does close a bit early (10.30). The one bit of the resort that could use some improvement is the evening entertainment in the main bar - very child orientated (ok it is Disney!). We gave that a miss - usually being out in the parks or at dinner. French Quarter had a much better schedule with a jazz/blues type act on most nights - would have liked to have seen a bit of that at Riverside too.

It is a moderate resort, not a 5 star hotel. For a moderate resort, this is wonderful. We stayed here for 8 nights in early December 2011. We were in the Aligator Bayou section of the resort. Note, this is the ONLY section of the Disney moderate resorts that sleeps 5. It was a fabulous stay for my family. We had requested a new refurbished room, but due to delays at the airport we checked in too late for that and were given a standard room the first night. It was nice, and I loved the beautiful location of the first building. The next morning I requested we were moved to the new rooms and they got us a refurbished room right next to the parking lot. My kids got a kick out of the Princess and the Frog theme just like I was hoping they would. \u2013(See pictures) While the first room was nice, the second was better. In the refurbished rooms, the trundle bed pulls down from the way instead of rolling under one of the beds like it does in the old rooms. The room we were in on nights 2-8 was a connecting room. We only heard the people to us on night two though- it sounded like a poor little kid having a meltdown/tantrum late at night. Wasn't too bad though, all of my kids slept through it. Didn't hear a peep other than that. The resort was beautiful- but I say that as a nature lover. It might not appeal to those without a fondness for trees, streams and fuzzy little animals. My kids loved it. They got so excited every time they spotted a squirrel, rabbit, lizard or bird. I thought the staff did an excellent job, everyone we interacted with was professional and treated us with respect and kindness. Everyone was very friendly, and my kids were made to feel special. Pros- Beautiful resort Boat to Downtown Disney was very convienient Pools were great (1 large and 4 small at Riverside, plus access to 1 large at French Quarter) Refurbished rooms were fun Food court had lots of options Quiet and peaceful Lots of biking and jogging trails (I saw many joggers each morning) Cons- Rooms are small Trundle bed was small (my oldest was too tall to use it) Only a curtain between the sink/vanity area and the sleeping area No free internet (Are you kidding?

Much more storage than we anticipated which was a bonus since we had to sneak in and hide a small Christmas tree in the armoire and still store all our clothes. We had a very roomy mini-fridge and small coffee maker. There is even a shelf area under the double sinks which is great for storing personal items and luggage. The soundproofing in the rooms was great and we never heard anything except for an occasional muted toilet flush from the adjacent rooms. Our maid Diana did a fantastic job cleaning the room and must have been trained by a Marine Drill Sargeant in making beds because they were made so tightly we practically had to tear the bedding apart to get into the beds at night:) My suggestion is to skip the food at the resort though as it is marginal and skimpy at best in the quick service areas. I would also skip those ridiculously expensive resort mugs which hold almost nothing and can only be refilled at the one restaurant. And NESCAFE is the only \"coffee\" they serve. The pool near us looked gorgeous and fun and we would have loved to have had the time to try it out but just couldn't work it in. We also didn't make it to the cane pole fishing or playground. Caught a little bit of the evening entertainment guy on my way to refill the $17 refillable mug as often as I could and he seemed to have quite a following. My kids liked the arcade the one evening we came back a little early. We took the boat to Downtown Disney and it was pleasant and scenic but ultimately took a very long time and was crowded so we opted to drive for future trips. We used our car the whole time so I can't really comment on the bus service except for the one time we rode it one evening to EPCOT and the first one was too full to take even half those waiting and the second was also PACKED when it got to our stop with just enough room to squeeze on 4 adults and 4 little kids all standing right in the area where the doors open. On the \"return\" later that night well before park closing we waited a very long time before again squeezing as tightly as possible onto the fourth bus for our resort that came and the que remained overfilled the entire time we were there and as we left. That is really my biggest complaint about any of the resorts during high volume times is that the bus system is inadequate in the mornings and evenings. Disney should really stop cramming every single body it can onto every bus. It's truly not safe. You've got little kids piled on laps or squished between very large standing adults. If the driver slams on the brakes or makes a sharp maneuver and someone loses grip on a pole, a larger person falling could seriously injure or kill someone. It used to be that the buses were a great reason to stay on site but it seems now Disney is building rooms and decreasing buses. And the wait in the evenings for the buses can be outrageous. This is made much worse by the large number of people who do not normally need them opting for those motorized scooters to get around the parks. They are always allowed to break in line and get loaded on the next bus no matter how many other people are waiting for bus after bus (which I never understood because those people are sitting down while they wait for the bus while the rest of us are standing). And before someone thinks I am talking about the handicapped, let me assure you I am not. I've got no problem with accomodating the handicapped. I am talking about people who rent one and then change out who in their large party is driving it throughout the day and use them to get preferred \"handicapped\" seating for their group on rides and even let the kiddies who were hanging off the handrails like monkeys moments before take a spin around while waiting.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cok place to stay\u201d", "Author": "mlm123", "ReviewID": "UR122162599", "Content": "Grounds were beautiful but rooms left something to be desired.

Upon rebooking the trip for October, I found that there were no rooms available at the POFQ, and decided to book into Riverside instead. With that said, I can honestly say that there is no comparison between the two hotels. Riverside is actually a very nice hotel and the grounds are beautiful, but that's about it. The main problem is its size. If you're not staying in a room near the main building and pool, be prepared to walk and walk and walk. It takes forever to get where ever you are going. The other major issue I had was with the bus service for this hotel. There are four depots here and you have to stop at all of them at one point or another. It takes forever. After having stayed at the POFQ on our previous three trips to Disney, I couldn't get away from Riverside fast enough. The rooms are fine, the hotel is beautiful, but it has to be the most inconvenient property on Disney. Too much walking and too much waiting to get where you need to go. POFQ is a much better place to stay. Not as crowded and everything is close by. Bus service is much better there. We will not be staying at Riverside again.

There is also the option to take the boat to Downtown Disney, which is a very pleasant journey. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, but this is the case all over Disney property. The Food Court located next to the lobby of the hotel serves a wide variety of food, enough choice for everyone!

We had not been to disney in over 12 years, and all the properties we visited looked brand new. Although it was May, it never felt too crowded or overun. The option to take the boat to Downtown Disney was a HUGE plus. I definitely reccommend using this. We also took advantage of the pool area on the French Quarter side of the resort. Also an awesome pool that our son really enjoyed. For people debating between staying on property vs off property, I think it would be WISE to stay ON property. The PERKS are well worth it.

The \u201cAlligator bayou.\u201d area has smaller accommodation blocks and an informal feel and atmosphere. The other region (called Magnolia Bend) is an impressive and formal deep south, old grand mansion, look and feel area. There is a (0.9 mile) walkway / cycle path which forms a loop around and across the Sassagoula river which runs through the center of the resort. The pathway has a link to through to the French Quarter resort. The path affords great views of the resort as you wander, jog or cycle around it. Depending on which accommodation you get you may get very familiar with the walkway as you trail back and forward to the food court. Aside from the theming the rooms are identical. The Alligator bayou rooms have (fake) log bed frames which are really easy to stub your toes on. (yep I speak from experience there.) The rooms are slightly bigger than an All Star Resort room and have a refrigerator and coffee making facilities. Other than that they are the same basic layout with the door at the front and the bathroom (with no window) at the rear. The room can be a little dark if the lights are switched off. (Why would you be in the room during the day anyway?) The air conditioning is a through the wall unit rather than a central type and it can be a bit noisy if you leave it on. (It\u2019s Florida, you will probably leave it on.) There are some good swimming pools with the relaxed \u201cOl\u2019 Man Island\u201d pool having a water slide. All Pools at Disney are heated so you can swim all year round. Food court. The resorts reception, bars shop and restaurants are located in the \u201cSassagoula Steamboat Company\u201d building. There is service restaurant (Boatwright\u2019s) and a general dining area (Riverside Mill) with a reasonable choice of food. Both are nicely themed. There is also a bar which serves snack food in the main building and a bar poolside on Ol\u2019 Man Island. The shop has a limited choice of essential items and the usual large choice of Disney items. This is a nice calm and relaxed resort. It is a more grown up resort than All Star for not excessively more money. The grounds and general ambiance is superb and this makes the resort feel like it is a higher standard than the moderate grade it is afforded. I would not recommend this as a first choice for families with young children as it isn\u2019t quite as \u201cDisneyfied\u201d as other resorts.

We stayed here from the 1st-15th November. We booked because it was one of the cheaper places to stay and after booking and looking at the photos and reviews I became very tempted to change to the Caribbean resort which was the same price. When we got the hotel I was really glad we didn't. We arrvied around half 6 in the evening after a 9 hour flight. (got through customs quite quickly and used Disney's Magical Express which was wonderful and simple) We we're checked in by an employee from Sheffield Hallam University, which is our local university at home which was quite interesting. He talked us through our dining plan and (after reading reviews on TripAdivsor) I asked if we could have a room located near the reception. He said it wasn't a problem but said we had been put in a recently renovated room and that it wasn't too far from a bus stop. We agreed on the new room and decided to take our own cases there. We ended up in Magnolia terrece, room 8504. I must say, I was impressed. It looked nothing like the photos and was much more updated with a lovely blue bedding and headboards with characters from Princess and The Frog which was a lovely touch, but not over powering. There were a few little things such as a stain on a throw pillow and mark on the bathroom wall but it didn't really bother us. There isn't a wardrobe but the rack seemed to work just fine for us as there were plenty of drawers too. We ordered pizza using the inroom phone which was great and it was with us within about 20 mins, which was great. The TV channels had a decent choice so it provided some great relaxation after a long day. We found that our room was VERY close to the east depo bus station but we mainly used the south depo near the reception as buses seemed more frequent (maybe just our timing) but we never really waited more than 5 mins throughout our holiday for a bus to the parks. It was more crowded coming back but they seemed to have enough coaches, even if it was a little tedious after hours at the parks. The bus service itself was great, we used it to go to EPCOT on most nights so we could 'eat our way around the world' and with them coming back late, we thought it was fantastic. We also surfed a Typhoon Lagoon and chose not to stay. There were no buses back to hotels at this time and a very kind employee took us in his car back to our hotel without any charge, definatly something that made us happy as it was a cool day. The grounds are fantastic and wonderful to walk around. we saw some wonderful wildlife, mainky squirells and frogs and a couple of newts but it was rather refreshing, it was great to just escape all the rush when we were there. We took a few walks down the river on warmer days and also used the water taxi which was again, great. The onsite restaurant was also great and we ate there on our second night. Not a huge menu, but still very nice. The starter bread tastes a lot like victoria sponge cake which we loved. The food court also has a huge selection and I really enjoyed the 'make your own pasta' which was a refreshing choice from the burgers and nuggets. We used the dining plan, which I would recomend to everyone as we were never left hungry and saved a fortune. Meals in the park came to around $16 each and on sit down meals we ended up spending what would have been $130, so it was well worth the extra money. My only real problem was that after the first week we wanted to lay in bed a little longer and during the late morning the pathways are cleaned and it's very loud. If you intend to be out by 10, you won't notice this. The maid cleaned our room every day which made me very happy and we also got some lovely flannel ducks made. Overall I would go back here again and again.

In the time between my last visit, the resort has begun (and is currently undergoing) a massive rennovation which has yielded some VERY positive results. That said, if you plan to visit in the next few months, do ask reservations for a room in one of the rennovated buildings, if possible. After that time, I suspect the project will be completed and all rooms will be back up to the quality one would expect from Disney. A few notes to consider with respect to this review (and likely any other for this hotel): 1. You are paying for the convenience of being on the Disney Resort property. Thus, you'll likely find that the rooms are priced according to Disney's normal pricing structure (aka: a bit higher than you'd find on the open market). If that's a problem for you, consider staying off-property or looking for one of the many Disney sales that happen through the year. Otherwise, accept that it's just a bit more expensive to stay at Disney, overall, and move on so you can enjoy your experience. 2. The resort is LARGE. That means you'll have lots of peaceful grounds to stroll, a variety of great photo opportunities and possibly some choice when it comes to room selection. It also means that problems can be a bit trickier to sort out as there are a lot of other guests. So, the good news: the rennovations are simply lovely. During our stay, we stayed in both a rennovated Alligator Bayou room and a Mansion room both of which were expertly done. The more rustic Alligator Bayou rooms contain quaint Mickey-themed quilt bedspreads, nicely detailed tiled floors in the bathrooms and beds that appear to be made of unfinished wood. All rooms have fridges and these are hidden in a nice wooden cabinet next to the new flatscreen television. The Mansion rooms are made to look like southern plantations and carry the charm of the \"old south.\" New, bigger sinks make storage easier, the bathrooms are tiled in bright white which was nicely cleaned for our visit and the new, bigger queen beds have inlaid paintings featuring scenes from the resort. All in all, the changes are most welcome and give the place the fresher, cleaner look one desires from a resort of this nature. As always, service is quick and pleasant here. At busy times, you'll wait a bit for a bus (again, you should expect this from Disney) and there will likely be lines at reception and in most eating areas. That said, service is efficient and we had no difficulty obtaining bellmen to help with luggage, desk clerks to assist with boarding passes and the team of fantastic folks at the on-site airline check-in desk even arrived a few minutes before the posted time of 5:00 AM to help ensure our bags were checked for our flight back home. We did have an issue at check in which was not able to be resolved immediately. That said, I do feel Disney did all they could to fix the situation. My mother has extreme difficulty with stairs and some trouble walking and thus we had paid for a preferred room to ensure we could cut down on walking at the resort. When we arrived (very late at night) we were given a second-floor Alligator Bayou room. We promptly called check-in to request a different room and I was told all rooms were full at that time. That said, the staff said if we could stay there that night, we would be moved to a new room first thing in the morning on the first floor of the Mansion buildings. While we were terribly inconvenienced having to move my mother into the second floor room, the staff was true to their word and a first-floor room was presented to us the next day. They also promptly removed the \"preferred room\" charges from our bill to compensate for the trouble. All-in-all, I feel they did the best they could to fix the situation. Additionally, I was told that should we visit again, we should absolutely call the Disney special-needs reservation line, a number dedicated to visitors who need additional assistance, and they would ensure that the problem was not repeated. If you are in a situation to need this service, please investigate via the Disney website. I certainly will next visit. The bad news? The resort is often crowded (as one of the more reasonably priced moderate offerings, many families do stay here) and the breakfast hours in the cafateria style section often reflect that. The room is reasonably sized, though, and I never had difficulty finding a place to sit. Food served here is of reasonable quality and priced, again, as one would expect at a theme park. (You're basically a captive while on property so expect to pay for that!) The best deal available, in our opinion, is the large cheese pizza which was surprisingly good (no, seriously, we were shocked) and could easily feed a family of four for about $16. Also, if you're to stay more than a few days and did not bring your own collection of beverages and/or groceries, we suggest the refillable mugs. Four visits to the beverage station at the main building pretty much pays back the investment in the mug. Since we flew in, we found it to be a good deal with respect to the benefits received/cost ratio. Like everything else, the key, we found, was to just ask nicely for anything we needed. Even though the resort was VERY busy for the holidays, we never encountered an instance where someone was unwilling to assist us.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax", "Title": "\u201cPreferred Room at Port Orleans Riverside\u201d", "Author": "cfudge", "ReviewID": "UR121668840", "Content": "We had an excellent stay from Sunday to Friday at POR.

So I have stayed at many different Disney hotels. This particular Disney hotel was in the Moderate price range. Being in the Moderate price range means you can go cheap, but still get more of the Disney Magic than you would at the Value resort. Let's do the basics: The room was clean and nicely decorated, the staff was AMAZINGLY nice, the food was good (two food options, one was quick service cafeteria style, the other was a sit down place. The bar had food too, I think?) The maid started doing fun and clever things with our towels it was nice. It was a very nicely maintained property too. We did a lot of the activities they offered, we saw a movie under the stars, watched Bob preform in the bar (Fun, you should see it) rented bike etc. So the resort itself had a lot to do. Transportation. The bus system was good, I never had to wait very long, but sometimes when you just want to get home at the end of the day it was long. The boats to get to Downtown Disney also took a fair amont of time too. But this is to be expected at a Moderate resort, after all the more expensive, the closer to the park. The reason this does not get a 5 out of 5 was the room itself. Our Toliet wouldn't stop flushing and our bed creeked a bit. Neither one of these were HUGE problems because we weren't in the room the whole time. And after we called (twice) someone came to fix it. The walls were also thin. Not paper thin where you could hear every word, but thin enough where you would know something was going on.

Although I've come to expect higher hotel prices over holiday periods, this hotel was very overpriced for the quality of service and the quality of the room. We arrived Friday afternoon, a peak arrival time for any holiday wekend, and there were only two staff members checking people in - something that management should have probably better planned for given the number of reservations that they had for Labor Day weekend. The check in line weaved through the entire lobby and out the front door of the hotel. After nearly an hour wait, we finally made it to the front of the line. While checking in, my husband reminded the staff member that we were meeting up with my in-laws, who had checked into Port Orleans a couple of days prior. We booked our Disney trip through Disney Vacations, not through an outside service, and while making the reservation provided the representative with my in-laws reservation number over the phone in order to ensure that our rooms were near each other. This part of the reservation was apparentally \"lost\" and the \"best\" that the hotel could do was provide us with a room on the complete opposite side of the hotel in the Alligator Bayou building closest to the lobby, while our in-laws were already checked into Parterre Place in the Magnolia Bend area. This was a no go, and after asking several more times for a room closer to our in-laws, we were finally given a room in Magnolia Terrace, two buildings away from Parterre Place. Better, but still not ideal, especially since the request for adjacent rooms was made at the the time that we booked the trip. This was topped off by overhearing the family next to us trying to check in, whose entire reservation had been lost n the computer system, despite the fact that they had a copy of the reservation paperwork that Disney had sent them. Needless to say, the entire check in process left a bad taste in our mouths. Then, we got to the room, which was very underwhelming considering the price that we were paying to stay there. We hadn't checked any luggage, so we had very little in the way of personal toiletrees. For the price we paid for this hotel, the least I expected was a bottle of shampoo AND a separate bottle of conditioner, but alas, only shampoo was to be found. Considering the room rate was comparable to that of high end hotel chains, I expected to find more at the bathroom sink when we arrived than just a single bottle of shampoo, which wasn't replaced by the maid once during our stay.

Wanting it to be as special as possible, I booked a room a a Disney resort, off-season so that the parks would be less crowded. Our dream vacation became a nightmare when the handicapped room that I'd especially requested was not simply a long walk from reception, but up a steep flight of stairs, with no elevator. Needless to say, the room had no handicapped facilities (tub bar, etc.). To facilitate a change, I needed to leave my mother alone in an isolated, unfamiliar place in the dark, while I hiked back to reception. The new room, still far away, had a bad chemical smell when the air conditioning was on, which became a burning smell when the heat was on. Repeated calls to reception elicited no response for nearly an hour, when room service came by, offering to spray something on the unit to cover the odour. About 20 minutes after that, two managers showed up and our room was finally changed. My mother was exhausted. Our bags didn't show up for another hour. We'd arrived at 5pm, it was 10:30 at night when things were straightened out enough so that I could finally bring some dinner back to the room. None of the rooms we were offered had facilities for the handicapped, quite a drawback for my mother. The managers had agreed to refund the first night, since we couldn't use our passes. The room was not refunded until I insisted upon it at check-out. Things only got better when I decided to send a few things home by UPS, a service the hotel offered. My UPS bill was under $19.00. The charge to my credit card was over $127.00. The concierge (who pouted when I didn't tip him for weighing my package) had \"somehow\" overcharged me. He also \"forgot\" to send the parcel for 5 days. The resort itself is very generic looking. Complaints about the handicapped rooms elicited a response that the booking agency hadn't requested them.

In addition, I have stayed at the majority of Disney World's other \"on property\" resorts. Port Orleans Riverside continually delivers the best themed Disney experience for the dollar paid. This means you feel totally immersed in the environment once you check in. As you know from the description, there are two areas, Magnolia Bend (antebellum mansion style) and the \"Alligator Bayou\". Request the Magnolia Bend if you want the more formal room/building setting which is closer to the front desk, restraunts, and other ammenities. Stay in the \"Bayou\" if you want solitude and a more relaxed setting. Both are great- each area has access to \"quiet pools\" while the \"feature pool\" area is a short walk from everywhere (closer to Magnolia Bend). In my latest stay, I was housed in the Bayou. The only problem I experienced was with my room keys.... The front desk encoded them incorrectly and once in the Bayou, they didnt work. It took Disney front desk staff around 20 min to come out to the room to replace them once alerted (while I was standing outside holding all my luggage near by - not happy). This experience isnt normal but do be aware due to the layout of this resort, any type of assistance is NOT immediate (including but not limited to housekeeping requests). Riverside has a better selection of food items at its informal food court than its sister resort, Port Orleans French Quarter. In addition, Riverside has the on site formal dining option, Boatwrights, which serves Breakfast and Dinner (no lunch). Finally, Riverside offers more in the way of recreation. Riverside is the home of the main marina for both Riverside and Port Orleans. From here you can rent personal \"Sea Rayers\" and other water craft for sailing down the Sassagoola River all the way to Downtown Disney. Riverside OR French Quarter are both excellent places to bring or rent bicycles. The paved loop around the resort is a couple of miles I believe and a really pretty setting for a leisurely ride. (more serious riders should seek another location for riding). I believe (but cannot confirm) that most rooms contain 2 double size beds. Most couples today find these beds too small. Just something to consider or ask about. I didnt think the comfort of the beds were superior, just average. If I had to say anything negative about this resort, it would the comfort of the beds (which I know is very subjective). Finally, the only other negative comment is lack of wireless internet connectivity. It just amazes me that in today's world, Disney wouldnt have wireless connectivity (at no additional charge) in all of its resorts. I understand that they have made great progress recently in their deluxe and convention resorts but not everywhere (including Riverside). Many vacation spots (and business hotels) now offer wireless internet free of charge - its becoming expected in my opinion). I would strongly encourage Disney to do the same. Overall though, I highly recommend this resort and will be back myself (even with no connectivity to the outside world - maybe that isnt such a bad thing afterall?)", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "newport, gwent, south wales", "Title": "\u201cFabulous place!\u201d", "Author": "pinkfaerie24", "ReviewID": "UR120807883", "Content": "Just come back from a two week family holiday, there were 8 of us, at the port Orleans riverside resort.

There were quite a few different pools to choose from, the main pool was very lively and a nice pool bar there, the other pools were quieter and we had one right near our room so that was great! There was a boat service to downtown Disney which was fab, although getting the bus was quicker. Bus service was great, always loads of buses, they would fill up quickly really early in the morning but always seem to put enough buses on to accommodate. Overall we had a fantastic stay here, didn't want to leave, definitely going to go back there! Disney dining plan is highly recommended too as we saved so much on that, food great in our hotel and wolfgang pucks in downtown Disney was a great place to use the DDP. On the last day between myself and my partner we have 13 main meals left and 21 snack credits, we used the snack on sweets to bring home(which would have cost over $100! also if you have main meals left you can ask at your hotel for them to change them to snacks so you can use them up!

And the grounds were so beautiful and lush. We stayed at the Pop Century previously and the surroundings here were much prettier. My kids loved the pool, it was great it was open from 7am-Midnight. The water slide did close at 8:00pm though. Nice to let them swim after coming home from the parks. Take some time to enjoy the pool and relax. Running from park to park from open to close is no way to relax. We did take the boat to Downtown Disney. We didn't like Downtown Disney it was crowded and full of overpriced merchandise. The only good part was the Margarita Bar, and the Dinosaur Restaurant was loud and overpriced with yucky food. We saved a ton of money by NOT getting the Dining Plan.

This was our first stay at a Disney resort, and we picked POR because it was the cheapest option for a family of 5! These are just some random thoughts I thought I would share for others who are interested in POR. We checked in at 1PM, and our room was ready. We were in Alligator Bayou, building #25, first floor. Our room was a fairly long walk from the main building (it seemed longer toting our carry-on luggage), but a nice short walk to the West Bus Depot, where we went much more often. BUSES - Disney did a great job with the buses. I actually tracked how long we had to wait for a bus each time we went to a bus stop (because I'm just that nerdy), and our average wait was 8 minutes, including three times we went before park opening for early breakfast reservations at a restaurant inside the park. We only had one wait longer than 15 minutes - we waited 25 minutes at peak bus time (8:45AM), and when the bus arrived, it was full. Another bus followed shortly. We always used the West Depot (one stop after the South or Main Depot) - buses come around to all the stops at all times, even for early breakfasts. If you just plan on the bus always taking 15 minutes to arrive, you'll usually be pleasantly surprised. Do plan on allowing an hour to get from POR to another resort - that's just about how long it typically took us. BOAT - We took the boat from POR to Downtown Disney once and back from DD twice. It stops at French Quarter both on the way to DD and on the way back. The first boat of the morning is scheduled to depart at 10AM, but the morning we were headed to the dock at 9:50, we saw the boat already leaving, but it was just a short wait for the next one. It was a beautiful boat trip, especially one evening when we returned to POR by boat with a full moon! It passes by the Saratoga Springs Treehouses, which were fun to see. A nice change from buses! NOISE - Alligator Bayou has got to be full of families of 5 with lots of kids, but it was pretty quiet. We rarely heard noise from the rooms around us. The exception was toilet flushing, which we could hear clearly, and thumping when kids ran on the 2nd level outside walkway. BUGS - Sorry to kill the magic, but there were bugs in the room. I wake up long before everyone else, so I sit in the bathroom and read or otherwise entertain myself until the others wake up. I saw one or more bugs in the bathroom every day ranging from tiny (size of a gnat) to small (size of a pencil eraser). We also saw them in the room a few times. I didn't complain to the hotel, because I didn't want them to come squirt poison in the room while we were staying there. And after all, it is Florida - even Disney can't coax the bugs away. There were also LOTS of mosquitos at the bus stop - we all got bitten multiple times while waiting for the bus, especially in the dusky mornings. I never noticed mosquitos elsewhere in the resort or at the parks.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Claremont, California", "Title": "\u201cSurprised in an great way.\u201d", "Author": "Brian B", "ReviewID": "UR120654481", "Content": "This was my second trip to WDW the previous year I stayed at animal kingdom lodge, which is their deluxe property and it was a good resort - never the less.

Amy not only met my expectations, but exceeded them. I visited her website and chose her because she would shop where I wanted her to and pick up the items I requested - unlike other choices I found online. In addition to regular grocery items, I had her pick up beer and wine for me as well. We met her out front of the hotel at the time mutually agreed upon and had bell services assist us with delivery to our rooms. I packed our toaster from home as well. This tip allowed us to eat breakfast in our room, pack a healthy lunch and snacks for the day. We ate in the hotel restaurants each night for dinner. We found the resort to be everything we expected. Clean rooms, friendly staff, and very scenic. We enjoyed the ferry boat to Downtown Disney, which was a nice option. When heading to the theme parks in the morning you are best to walk to the South Terminal for pick up - once the bus is full at this terminal it will not carry on to the West, North and East Terminals.

Downsides -- rooms were cramped (we had 5) and decor needed updating, however from what I understand, they are currently refurbing the rooms, so this may not apply any longer.

We absolutely loved this resort, especially how the Alligator Bayou rooms are set back in a more secluded area of the resort to make it look like you are truly far back in the Bayou region of southern Louisiana. You will need to do a little walking to get to the main area of the resort (e.g. lobby, restaurants, pools and bus stops) but at worst your walk to any of these spots shouldn't take more than 5 minutes and it's probably less than that for most Bayou rooms. Our room was very clean and the decor was fine (not elegant but very cozy). We appreciated housekeeping coming in every day to tidy up our things, make the bed, replace linens and they always left our kids with a treat of towel creatures or mickey ears on the bed. When we had the air conditioning unit on, it was a little smelly (musty). That just tells me that they need to replace the older AC units in these rooms, which I'm sure is part of their re-furbishment plans that they are currently doing at PO Riverside. What's extra nice is that you can take advantage of all the amenities at PO-French Quarter by staying at Riverside, and vice versa. You can either walk over to French Quarter (which I wouldn't recommend) or take the boat up the river for a short 5 minutes if you are car-less. We had our car, which made the 2 minute hop b/t resort sides very easy. We loved both main pools at Riverside and FQ and used both. The slides were a speical treat for our thrill seeking kids, and the pool activities in the late afternoon was also fun for both our 6 and 9 year olds. We also ate at both food courts, and thought food selection was great. Make sure you check out the bakery at the FQ food court. Yummie! My only dissapointment about Port Orleans is the upscale restaurant - Boatrights. I expected a little more, but the food was still pretty good (our service was not too good that night). The kids menu choices with the dining plan were fast food-like only (pizza, corn dogs, etc). That was very dissapointing for us, considering our kids like trying out different foods and we would've liked to seen something like shrimp jambalya or something else Cajun-sytle on their menu similar to what was on our adult menu options. You will love taking the boat up the river to Downtown Disney (esp. at dusk), for free. The bus stop delays were aggrevating, but aren't they all that way across the WDW resorts. We waited for 20 minutes both times we chose to ride the bus instead of take our car, but I don't think that's any reflection on the resort itself. All in all, it's a great resort and we can't wait to stay at Port Orleans again!

This trip we stayed at Port Orleans, Riverside. This is a Disney resort, on property, in the moderate category. I really enjoyed Riverside. Our room was in Alligator Bayou (Building 17), one of the two areas at Riverside. I loved the lush vegetation in the landscaping and the feeling of being in an exotic place. You do not see building after building, and cement, you see the beauty of the outdoors that Disney does so well. Just walking around the resort was relaxing. Our check in was easy even though our name was misspelled. The cast member was able to find it by the reservation number. One piece of advice, always have your reservation number, for resort and dining reservations!! That way they can find you no matter what!! Don't assume you can be found just with your name. Our room was quite spacious and had all we needed. Besides the 2 queen beds there was a table and 2 chairs, small fridge, plenty of drawer space for clothing, and lots of towels were provided. Our \"mousekeeping\" service was great. My daughter sleeps in and we were never bothered because we put the do not disturb sign on the door. However, when we returned later in the evening our room was always clean and fresh. I still say the only drawback to staying on property is you have to pay for internet. I have checked off property hotels and some have free internet yet some also charge. I would rather be on property. We did not use the buses this time so I cannot comment on that. There is also a boat that takes you to the Downtown Disney area, and I love the boat rides. My trips to the food court showed me that it is better to avoid the busy eating times because this is a large resort and you are going to find lines. If I went in during the breakfast rush (while darling daughter was sleeping) it was quite overwhelming, many families with many kids!! But when I was there later in the morning, say after 10am, it was no problem at all. If you can, either eat a light breakfast in your room or go to the place (park) you are visiting that day and eat breakfast there. I was however pleased with the offerings at this food court, as they are different at the various resorts. I liked this set up much better than Coronado Springs, another moderate resort at WDW. I LOVED the \"build your own yogurt parfait\" station. A fabulous breakfast, rich in protein, for under $5. Yum!! Great raspberries!

Last year we stayed at the value resorts and this year because we were traveling with my mom and brother we decided to step it up just a little bit. So, we chose the Port Orleans - Riverside. We took the Magical Express from the airport to the resort and barely had to stand in line which was a nice change because last year the line was really long. When we pulled up to the resort, you automatically get that feeling that you're on vacation. Everyone was \"dressed for the occasion\". The grounds lived up to the part. There were no lines at the registration desk and everyone was super friendly. As you can imagine, there are hundreds of rooms, but although we checked in at 11 a.m., we were still given access to our room. It was quite a hike to the room and it was quite confusing to actually find the room. When we walked in, my husband and I were kind of shocked at how similar it was to our room at the value resort. The only noticeable difference was the furniture was themed, but the room size was the same...or that's the way if felt! Once we got settled in, we walked to the bus stop to catch a ride over to the Animal Kingdom...that took a almost an hour! Buses to other attractions such as Magic Kingdom, Downtown Disney or EPCOT seemed to come through more regularly. Getting back wasn't as difficult probably because they anticipate the big crowds at the end of the day. Next leads me back to meals. The Riverside has cafeteria style dining as well as a bar and full service restaurant. We tried all three during our 5 night stay and we were thankful for the choices. It was of course overpriced and the quality was mediocre at best. The piano player in the bar was fun to listen to and he really got the crowd into it. For those that are thinking of staying here during the marathon weekend, give yourself a little more time if you're going to use the shuttle buses. My husband was able to get something quick to eat in the cafeteria before heading to the marathon, but the buses weren't running very often so he was afraid he'd miss the start of the race. The bottom line...remember you're on vacation. Try to relax and just go with the flow. Pros: Very friendly staff, several choices for food, clean rooms with daily cleaning services, grounds are well manicured and there are different activities throughout the hotel.

Even coming home after fantasmic, fireworks or late stays we never waited long for a bus an the north bus stop was so close to our room after a long day on our feet! Food was good - definitely try the create your own pasta - delicious and enough to feed two hungry adults!

The Riverside property has gorgeous landscaping, a property with two distinct feeling areas (the plantation style buildings and more backwoods bayou type housing). The rooms are essentially the same in both, but both seemed great. We loved our room in the Parterre building. It was a bit worn around the edges, but everything was very clean. I read recently that they are in the process of renovating all of the Port Orleans rooms, so my only negative comment is probably nullified by that work. I guess the only thing I can say is that I wish they had started renovations BEFORE we stayed there! The center of the property has a food court and a sit down restaurant, as well as a swimming pool. The pool looked really fun, but we weren't around long enough to really take advantage of that. One morning we walked from Riverside down to the French Quarter sister property for a begnet breakfast. They were not quite up to the New Orleans standard, but they were close enough that we could pretend a little bit! It was an easy 10 minute walk to the other property along the property's river (actually a canal I think). In any case, the overall stay was fantastic and we can't recommend it highly enough.

It was absolutley perfect. The rooms are a nice size for a family of four. Everything was new....beds, furniture, carpeting, paint, bathroom. The beds were very comfortable. We were in room 8230 right beside the Northside Bus Stop. The main pool was just a short walk away through the beautiful manicured grounds. The main pool was a generous size. Nice big kiddie pool as well. There's a fun water slide for the kids and pool bar for drinks. There's also a quiet pool between several of the buildings throughout the resort but the one closest to ours was closed due to repairs. The main common buildings were just a short walk from the pool... general store, food court, restaurant, marina.and check-in area. Having visited many different resort dining options over the years, this is one of the BEST food courts at Disney. Riverside Mill is the \"Quick Dining\" option and has something for everyone....a grill for burgers, chicken sandwiches, battered fish, fries, a sandwich area for deli and soups, a pizza area, a create your own pasta area and a bakery/ice cream area. Loved, loved, loved the pasta area! We didn't visit Boatwright's Dining Hall (casual dining restaurant). The piano bar was packed our last night and standing room only.

The other side of this Resort is the Port Orleans. A 5 min along the river to pick up FRESHLY made benieghs is a nice breakfast treat. We also spent a couple of evenings cocktailing in their lounge with wonderful live jazz, a very nice end to a great and tiring day.

This was not given - I know a request for upgrade is a long shot....however we were angry when we realised we had been given a room with 2 double beds in it (Magnolia) I asked where they assumed my 3 children were going to sleep (clearly in 1 bed they had planned). I stood there for an hour arguing (after 13 hours travel time) and all they could say was that it was ok in America that an 11 yr old boy sleeps with his 6&4 year old sisters. EVENTUALLY they brought a blow up mattress and plonked it down in front of the door ( clear fire risk as the door would not open properly) So in upshot my Son who had paid adult price for the privalidge lay there! I'm not used to such tiny rooms and our holiday was no holiday given we couldnt move without waking the children let alone put the TV on. The room allocated to a family of 5 was exactly the same as my parents were given...awful crammed for two weeks with 5 people, a buggy and 7 cases. I must say this ruined our holiday for myself and my husband. The double bed wasn't really big enough anyway and only had 1 bedside cabinet. The grounds are immaculate no question and the transportation is brilliant. The boat to downtown Disney was lovely and I loved Downtown Disney! The quick service meal plan was a great money saver without a doubt but we were sick to death of 'junk' food. At least one counter in the restaurant could change daily surely? The restaurant was busy, hectic and reminded me of school meal hall...stressed me out badly and often a wait for tables. Food: pizza, burger, salad, pasta, fries......on repeat for two weeks. Epcot had great selections so it can be done! Birthday: a gift was left for the children which was very greatfully received and a welcome touch indeed. The shop staff are friendly and happy. A huge miss for hotel entertainment and we were bored. There is a beautiful river they could make the most of with seating areas etc but there isnt any. I think most people must go off to a park (and we did go for parades etc) but when you want a relax without facing the crowds you may as well go to bed and watch a movie (unless you have 3 kids in a small room with you) The main pool wasnt my cup of tea at all....busy, noisy, shaded and kids play there until 11pm with no supervision. The French Quarter pool is better as are the quiet pools (but there are no towels) I think this hotel will come down to individual taste.

Called them again, & was told 10 more mins, they were on the way. Still NOTHING! Now it was 5 p.m. Still no delivery. Called again at 5 p.m. & they somehow mixed up our delivery & showed that it was already delivered. Um.....NO! We waited around for an HOUR! By this time we had to leave for dinner. Told them we were upset & would call them when we got back from the Magic Kingdom which would be around 11 p.m. In this respect, i don't think luggage/bell services knows what they are doing. No apologies either. My other complaint, again, would be that there is no \"queue\" line at the Bus Depot. Pop Century has one but Riverside does not. Aggravates me because we'd be waiting there for a bus in morning sometimes for 10-15 mins, bus finally pulls up, & then people who just walked into the depot would walk up to the loading area. Those waiting on the benches for the longer period of time should be first. All in all the Port Orleans Riverside is one of the best Mods on Disney Property.

Now that we have that straight, I seem to travel to Disney World at least once a year if not more and have stayed at many hotels both on and off site.

We took the Magical Express to the resort and it all worked well. I had done the online check-in from home and when we arrived everything was ready to go. Only took a couple minutes to check in and our room was even ready even though we arrived at 10:00 AM. The resort was very clean and the housekeepers had left a Mickey made from towels on the bed to greet us when we arrived. The past few times that we have gone to Disney World we have stayed at Caribbean Beach, Port Orleans French Quarter and the Hilton Downtown Disney. Rooms are a little smaller than the Hilton rooms but the free parking at both the resort and the parks, transportation system, and the amenities in general just make this a very nice place to stay. The main pool is very large and offers kids games and activites but the smaller pools between the buildings are very nice and laundry facilities are right in the pool area which makes it very convenient to do laundry and lounge at the pool at the same time! Almost makes doing laundry fun! The only issue we had while we were there was that the hair dryer broke. I called housekeeping and they sent someone right up and replaced it within a few minutes of my call. Great service. Food court is nice and offers a variety of menu options. They also have a sit down restaurant and bar area in the main building as well as a bar by the pool for adults. Overall I think this is a great option for families looking for a moderate resort. it is a little louder than the Port Orleans French Quarter mainly because it is a much larger resort.

The only gripe i have with the quick service is that everywhere you can eat there is not alot of healthy options unless you want to eat salad every day, no thanks lol. Now i think the official rating for this hotel is a 3* however it is Disney and the magic you experience from staying in a disney resort makes me rate my review higher, the staff are fantastic and really do make the Disney difference, one night we eat in the Planet Hollywood @ downtown Disney and it was amazing a great party atmosphere with amazing food, i later learned that if we had been on the Disney dining plan (usually free with the deluxe resorts) then we could have eat in there so next time i go to disney i may splash out and go to the animal kingdom lodge instead. Bare in mind this resort is massive however we were in Acadian House which was only about a 5 min walk to the main lobby and the dining hall, not that far at all and the walk is lovely, plenty of pools for everyone and the kids all seemed to be in the main pool as there was regular activities for them every day so you never really seen them at the other pools which was good. I really think anyone would enjoy staying at this hotel i am a travel agent and never usually stay at the same place more than once even if i loved it but this is the one hotel i made the exception for and i'm glad i did, absolutly amazing holiday and can't wait to return to disney in the future, if you have any questions feel free to ask and i will try and answer as soon as possible. So don't delay just get it booked! LOL If you are booking a stay for next year Disney once again are doing the free dining plan offer with some of their holidays this is excellent value for money, take my advice if you want to save money book up in advance if you wait for a late deal it will possibly be slighty cheaper however you won't get the free dining plan so its not worth your while alot of people who were staying in the hotel who had booked late deals actually paid more than me and never got the dining plan, which if it was me i really wouldn't be happy!", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati", "Title": "\u201cGreat memories made but I'd try another Disney property next time.\u201d", "Author": "rsc344", "ReviewID": "UR118911623", "Content": "Just returned from a week staying at Port Orleans, Riverside.

We went to the french quarters pool, but only stayed an hour as it loads of fly like insect everywhere, the following day went to the main pool at riverside and exact same thin so just used the pool by our room for rest of holiday. Used borth resturants,in the morning between 9.30-10.30 it was impossible to get table in quick service resturant, so we used the smaller resturant to sit on a few occasions. We were also on the dining plan(friends recommendation) which saved us a fortune as our 4 yr old lived on chicken nuggets and hot dogs for the 2 weeks.

There was a line and waited 15 minutes to see a representative.

When we got in the room, there were towels that were used by the previous guest hanging in the bathroom and the sheets on the one of the beds were questionably changed before we arrived. We also had luke warm water our entire visit and our AC unit smelt like something was burning. When we call the front desk about the AC unit the gentleman's response was that there was a camp fire burning near the pool (keeping in mind we were about a 5 min walk away from the pool area). Everything is too crowded from the boat service to the Market place to the busses, Disney really needs to increase the number of busses for Port Orleans. The gentleman at the front gate was RUDE and the staff was not what we have experienced before at other Disney resorts. We have stayed at Port Orleans - French Quarter and had a much better experience. I would also recommend looking into Key West Resort as an alternative for typically 20 dollars more or so a day, might be worth it.

There were eight people in our party, including two children ages nine and seven, and my parents aged seventy five and seventy six. It is fair to say that there is something to please everyone whatever their age. We stayed at Port Orleans Riverside in the mansions and what a wonderful setting it is in. Our rooms were comfortable and kept clean daily by a maid,who made animals out of the towels,the kids loved that. The beds in our room were quite small and we ended up having one child and one adult per bed, i would ask for kings next time. Whilst there we used the river shuttle to the French Quarter to have a look around and used the hot tub there. Again all towels were provided poolside, and the whole set up was lovely. We upgraded the quick service dining plan to the waiter service plan, because we thought that there would be more variation in food. The meals were very nice and they averaged about $110 for four of us. All we had to pay was gratuities which worked out at about $17 per meal. We enjoyed all of the meals although we though that the children's meals were quite poor really, for choice and amount. In fact we found the whole dining plan a bit confusing. The information given by the very helpful staff varied depending on who you asked. Maybe a bit more info displayed in the parks and restaurants would help. At the end of the holiday we had 13 waiter service meals unused. The prices were a bit steep in the parks, ie, chicken nuggets & fries outside the parks was 0.99cents, inside the parks $9.99... so the dining plan is essential really with a family, but i think Disney is inflating the prices to ensure you need to go this route and pay up front for food.

We stayed in room 8006 in the Acadian House - the rooms in this section have just been refurbished so everything was new. Rooms have two sinks, bath/shower, LCD TV and fridge. This is a great position to be in as the pool is a 2 minute walk and it takes about 5 minutes to get to the main bus stop, although there is a closer one right outside the block. There is also a private pool around the back of the lodge just for Acadian House guests, but unfortunately this was being refurbished during our visit so we never managed to use it. Only minor downside to the room was the noise from other rooms when they flush the toilet which was quite loud. We never ate in the sit-down restaurant, only the Riverside Mill Food Court but they offer a good variety of food. There is a bakery (the cupcakes are delicious!), pizza, pasta, burgers and fries etc. with soda machines where you can fill up your refill mug. Buses come and go all the time and the boat trip to Downtown Disney is also nice when you fancy a change. One thing we did seem to notice though is that at every Disney park the bus queue for Riverside always seemed to be the longest one. One night in particular at Hollywood Studios there was a huge queue which we would have had to wait about 30 mins in - in the end we ended up getting the bus to French Quarter and the bus driver kindly dropped us off at Riverside.

But it didn\u2019t last. After checking in and purchasing our park passes, a wonderful gentleman wisked us over to our room in a cart. His cheerful personality made up for the reception we had at the front desk. Our room was in a great location (Oak Manor) close to the food court/store, bus stops, main pool and quiet pool and was on the first floor. All our room request were met. The rooms are a little older looking and d\u00e9cor could definitely use an update but overall the rooms are nice. The fridge is especially great for water, milk and snacks. The beds are super comfy. The air conditioning seems strange and we could never could get a good temperature in the room. The double sinks separate from the bathroom are great. The food court is great. Lots of choices and good hours, although if you eat here frequently you will get tired of the menu. We also went over to Port Orleans French Quarter and ate over there a couple times. Atmosphere at this hotel is quiet and relaxing. Even though you know there are lots of people, it never sounds or looks like it. The bus waits were not bad and the covered waiting area was great. The store is large and has a lot of merchandise. One of the great things about this hotel is the boat to Downtown Disney \u2013 however if it\u2019s raining or chance of thunder storms the boat will not run.

Don't know if it was a driver issue or a bus issue. When we got back to the resort I went to express my concerns to a member of the resort management, but she didn't want to hear it. I was told this was a transportation issue, not a resort issue, and I would need to take it up with them. We have stayed at just about every resort on Disney property, and by far the transportation issues and the lack of managements concern, make this about the worst property at Disney in terms of moving guests, unless you have your own car or rent one.

Now I must add this in. This place is huge, my wife and I are fifty somethings in good shape, if you are in the Alligator Bayou section, your walk to the lobby will be five to fifteen minutes depending what building you are in. That's not so bad on a pleasant day but a 90 degree day with high humidity and your soaked by the time you reach the lobby. The walk is beautiful, the grounds are pristine but do request a room close to the lobby if your going to be eating breakfast in the food court each day. Our room was in building 34, it had been refurbished including a flat screen TV. These rooms feature double sinks but the area above and around them is small with not so much space for all of your toiletries. The toilet and shower are a bit cramped but you can make do just fine. The maid service is very good, whatever you ask for they will be happy to get it for you. The main pool is a wee bit small for such a large resort, we were there the second week in September and on the weekend it was crowded, I can only imagine this area in the busy season. The food court is good at best. I would suggest having a danish or fruit bowl for breakfast using your snack option and use your quick service for a nice lunch in one of the parks. As for Boatwrights on the property it was ok but I would not waste a sit down option here. On the weekends a piano player entertains in the lounge, Bob, is very energentic and gets the crowd to participate, including children, so go at least one night while you are at this resort. We never waited more then five minutes for a bus, but it was the off season. The bus ride to all parks in about 10 minutes. Be prepared to spend $2.50 for a bottle of water and if your not on a dinning plan forget the food court, it's simply not worth the money, I believe everything is overpriced to make those that are on the dinning plan feel like they are getting their moneys worth. In summary, the place is lovely, I would stay again.

My girlfriend and I went here this September for a 9 night stay and everything was perfect. We are both in our low 20s for anyone who cares about that. First of all we were worried about what people said about so much walking...we couldnt figure it out as we walked all over the resort and there are four bus depots and the longest walk to a depot would be just over five minutes...considering you walk for 8 hours in a park the five minutes is doable!!! Our room was full of southern charm and had much needed ice cold a/c, a fridge, a double sink, a separate shower and toilet and two queen beds which we wish were one king but wasn't worth the extra 25 bucks per night. It was extremely functional, not the fanciest room ever but the price reflects that and honestly was more than ample for the one hour a day and sleep that we used it for. The double sinks were a lifesaver as were the separate shower and toilet when you are getting ready in the morning. Howbout the service!? It was pretty good again. I found front desk to be very accommodating and friendly. The cleaner gave us a swan towel art thing the first day and made us a cute little toothbrush holder character which really made us smile. So we tipped her two dollars two days in a row (keep in mind we are staying for 9 nights) and she didn't make another shape which kind of sucked so we stopped tipping haha. The service was fine and our rooms were fairly clean when she left. The transportation is a key factor at staying on a Disney property and here they exceeded expectations all around. Again, there were four bus depots, we use the north and the south depot as the north was right by our building and the south was by the main lobby. Both places we got buses within 15 minutes and some were full and some were empty...the big thing is we got on them and didn't have to worry about renting a car or anything. The boat to downtown Disney is amazing and runs about every 10 minutes after 5 so it's easy and actually quicker than taking a bus. We took a cab to Universal Studios and it was about 20 minutes away and only $40 dollars each way. We also might note that we got a free Disney dining plan with this. This value was incredible!!! When we go back we will buy the plan regardless as you get about 70 dollars worth of food per person for free each day for a lot less money. We ate at le cellier, boma, crystal palace, California grill, and the brown derby all with the better portion or all of it included in our dining plan. Even if it's not free, trust me and get it, you will be q happy camper. We had an amazing stay here and if you are debating whether or not to stay at a Disney hotel bang your head on a table and wake up. The transportation, extra magic hours and dining plan options alone make it worth it! What really does it for me is the Disney magic and nostalgia you will feel when staying at the resorts. Every detail is considered and everything is kept meticulous and perfect. They say it's all in the details and Disney has that perfected. As far as the port Orleans riverside specifically it has all of these things. The grounds are breathtaking and so romantic. The cafeteria and restaurant seemed fine. The service was great. Stay here and you'll be happy. If you are deciding between here and french quarter than chose riverside as the French quarter looked a bit more cheesy while riverside was full of class.

Two queen beds, separate sink and toilet areas. Pretty standard hotel arrangement. However, Disney is very good about making those standard hotel rooms feel like home. Everything was very clean and and looked good. My only complaint is finding the room. The building is built like a maze, from trying to find the stairs, or even worse, the elevator, and then twisting and turning your way to the room. But, once you do it a couple of times, it becomes second nature. The lobby and check-in was easy and quick, waiting only a couple of minutes before be called to the check-in window. The \"general\" store was very large, and could fulfill your need to buy a Disney souvenir without venturing to Downtown Disney. The food court was large, but got very busy during peak times.

Sometimes we would not leave our room til after 12pm and then we sometimes came back as early as 5pm and housekeeping would always see to it that our room was always clean and set.

However, this resort is not only gorgeous in landscaping, it is perfect for anyone...the trails are easy to manuever for strollers or that early morning run, I love how close our building was to the main hub, and the pools are perfect. I was a little bummed to learn that the Magnolia Bend \"house\" was under construction, however, once we got into out rooms over at Oak House Terrace, we were pleasantly surprised! The rooms was the perfect size with our two kiddos and also on the corner, facing the pool. We loved it. The staff is super friendly, and any issue we had were resolved promptly. Upon checkout, we were unable to secure a late checkout, but we had three rooms tied to ours, so we suspected it was due to our large party (one of the other rooms did get a late checkout). As for food, we did NOT have the Disney dining plan, and we did just fine. For a family of 4, we spent about $20 for breakfast, and about that for lunch, maybe more for dinner. We brought snacks with us (we flew, by the way), and it saved us $$S! Plus, we bought the resort souvenir cup - it is worth the investment if you are there for more than 3-4 days. We did not eat at the nicer dining facility, the prices looked crazy for the same food at the cafeteria location. Plus, we ventured out to DT Disney and ate at the parks when we could... ACTIVITIES: We happened to go towards the end of summer, so there was SO much going on for the kiddos. If you have kids from 4-10 yrs old, sign them up for the Bayou Pirate Adventure. It is a great 2 hr excursion for your little pirate to learn a great story and go on a treasure hunt up the Sassgagoula River (sp?) - it is a little extra, but SO worth it! The three kiddos in our group had a BLAST, it was worth the investment! There was also \"Rec Agents\" at the pool that engaged the kiddos with games and contests, which was fun for all kiddos (especially the young at heart). We roasted marshmellows in the evening and then had movies under the stars, right next to our building!

(In the past we have stayed at Carribean Beach Resort and the water was FREEZING!) The hot tub was great for the adults. The Old Mill is so great for pictures. My kids love to walk up at night and see it lit up. We had such a nice stay we chose Port Orleans Riverside again this past July when we took my 81 year old grandmother for her first visit. She has a wheelchair, and we rented her a motorized scooter that was waiting for us upon our arrival. When the cast members at the front desk realized she had a wheelchair they gave us an adjoining room at no extra cost to make her more comfortable! I was so happy! The refrigerator in one of the rooms was not cold and maintenance replaced it with a new one even though it was late at night when we returned from the parks. And he was soooo friendly about it.

Even though all these things were great we had an awful experience with the maintancw and house keeping.

After calling several times and no one coming to fix any of our problems, we became very frusterated. It took them almost four days to do anything to help us. Their final suggestion was to move rooms and by this time we were leaving in two days and our other family members were attached to our room, so we decided to stick it out. Finally a nice maintenance man came and he let us in on a secret, they had just renovated the building we were in and we were the first to stay in the room we are in and no one really had made sure things were working.

As others have commented, the general theme of Riverside is well executed. Whether you end up in the Alligator Bayou or Magnolia Bend section, you do feel like you're in the deep South... and hanging around Ol' Man Island (i.e., the pool), the Fishin' Hole and the restaurant/boat landing area of the resort does make you feel a little like Tom Sawyer. The landscaping at Riverside is lush and it does a really good job of providing \"distance\" between each building, especially in the Alligator Bayou section. Strolling along the river and interconnected pathways is also quite enjoyable. My kids were a little disappointed, though, that the grounds didn't have some of those \"quirky/fun\" elements they remembered from the Value resorts (e.g., character sculptures to discover here and there). Personally, after a full day at one of the parks, I was kind of Disney-ed out and actually welcomed the break. In terms of the room, I saw no differences in the size of a Riverside room and one at a Value resort. There was more natural light, however, as our room had two windows (i.e., one on each exterior-facing wall). (Most rooms looked to be the same, too.) I also noticed that even the standard-category rooms in the buildings at the back of the property and facing the parking lots are very often shielded by some greenery, unlike my experiences at the Value resorts where your view in these types of rooms can literally be the parking lot, and nothing else. Otherwise, the quality of the furnishings and layout of a Riverside room is the basically the same as a room at a Value resort. Riverside's food court (i.e., Riverside Mill) was where I did notice a difference. Unless things have changed at the Value resorts, the food available here is better. I was surprised to see a cook-to-order pasta bar (you choose you own combination of noodles, sauces and toppings), a create-your-own salad station as well as a beef/turkey carving station with with vegetables (in addition to the standard hamburger, pizza and sandwich stations). I think all Value resorts have pool-side activities and outdoor movie screenings now, so there are no differences in that regard, but I found there was more to do at Riverside on non-park days, however. Things like a campfires, boat rentals, bike rentals, water-taxi to easily check out French Quarter resort and/or Downtown Disney, kids' pirate adventure cruise, fishing... Check the schedule when you're there if you're interested in the campfire as it's not held every night. In terms of transportation, if you leave for the parks before 10:30 a.m., you never share a bus with guests staying at the French Quarter resort (as I had read in reviews prior to going). Also, Riverside has four bus depots so those too tired to walk to/from the main (i.e., South) depot (just off the lobby/general store), can catch/get off the bus at the West, North or East depots, whichever is closest to their rooms. We never used this service, though, as we enjoyed the scenic walk to/from our room. Note that early-morning buses leaving the main/South depot head directly to a park and do not stop at the other depots; other buses service the other depots in the morning. Once at the parks, Riverside's buses essentially drop you off the same distance away from the entrances as the Value resorts' buses. The only exception I noticed was at Hollywood Studios where you get dropped-off closest to the entrance... closer than the Deluxe resorts' buses! Still, even being dropped off furthest from a park's entrance is really not a big deal... it maybe adds 2-3 minutes to your walk. From my research before going, there is roughly a $75 per night difference between staying st Riverside and a Value resort. Though the rooms aren't materially different that ones at a Value resort, Riverside feels more \"polished\" and more like a resort than any of the the Value resorts (which feel like motels) and so worth the extra dollars, in my opinion. If traveling with younger kids, especially if its their first time to Disney and/or you are a Disney enthusiast, I would actually recommend the Value resorts as they carry on the \"Disney fun\" much better.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beirut, Lebanon", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Resort, best choice ever will be visiting again for sure\u201d", "Author": "SaraDallal", "ReviewID": "UR117152342", "Content": "It was the best vacation ever and the resort is beautiful.

Location, convenience, service and the sense that you never leave the magic. It's true you could get a better deal for an equally beautiful hotel for cheaper but you'd miss: a) complimentary transfers to and from the airport complete with complimentary luggage transfer AND check in, b) extra magic hours (1 hour before a select park opens and 3 hours - yes, THREE hours - after the park closes, c) complimentary bus and boat transportation to the parks and d) the sense that you never leave Disney. In this hotel, that meant wonderful Disney movies at 9 pm outside on a green lawn, fun themed entertainment at the restaurants, excellent service and the use of the Disney meal plan if you purchase that. As for Riverside, you'd have to be a very sour person to not fall in love with this place. I'm a single mom and I went with 3 teens, and we LOVED it. I should say we had the fortune to be in one of the gorgeous newly renovated rooms--the room was large (two queens) and very tastefully decorated. Honestly, I've stayed at Polynesian, Contemporary and other more expensive Disney properties, and Riverside outshines them all, & is very reasonably priced for what you get. If you like privacy and beauty, as well as a beautiful, peaceful boat ride to Downtown Disney, this is definitely the place for you. We took long walks by the river, my kids swam in the main Riverside pool and the youngest did the slide and played the fun games the lifeguards led -- while I relaxed and read and soaked in the hot tub; at night we watched Disney movies on a screen outside while sitting on a lovely lawn. Service was excellent and helpful; at one point we were given wrong info on how to get to another restaurant and Riverside's concierge paid for complimentary taxi just to get us there on time. Best of all, they did this with a smile and proactively, offering this before I could even get upset. Wonderful. Strongly, strongly recommended. The rooms are constructed around a courtyard, and each major courtyard has its own tiny quiet pool, if you like more private swimming. In our case, the main pool was a five minute walk over a beautiful bridge. If you get the non-renovated rooms, I'd still recommend this place, particularly if you like beauty, privacy and quiet. The only negative would be for people with very small children, say, 3-5: too old to be in a stroller, can't really appreciate the beauty, a fair amount of waiting and walking for little feet. Families with children this age would be better served by a more convenient location such as the Contemporary .

What I mean by that is the grounds, pools, main lobby and main building are wonderful, while the motel-style room accommodations are unimpressive. If your idea of a good hotel/motel/resort is one that provides you with an excellent guest room, then Riverside will not be your idea of a good resort (the guest rooms are smallish, the bathrooms are tiny, and the beds are narrow.) However, if you are like me and only think of the guest room as a place to sleep during your stay, and that the primary reason to be at a Disney resort is to enjoy the common areas of the resort (and to visit the Disney theme parks), you will probably like Riverside. I have noticed a few reviewers mention that their rooms were not clean. That was not the case with our guest room. The interior of our room was very clean, and the outer perimeter of the building we stayed in was immaculately kept, with impeccably landscaped gardens. Riverside is a motel, not a hotel, but as far as motels go, it is by far and away the most exceptional motel I have seen. If you are arriving at Disney World by car (or intend to rent a car while at Disney World), you will appreciate the convenience of being able to quickly access your guest room from the parking lot. If you will not have a car during your stay at Riverside, be prepared to do a lot of walking, because this resort sprawls over a huge property. One of my favorite things about staying at Riverside was going for long walks through its spectacular grounds. My family stayed in the Alligator Bayou section of Port Orleans Riverside. This was not by choice, but rather it is the only section or Riverside which accommodates a family with 3 children. Disney resorts are not very accommodating to families with 3 children (once the youngest child is older than 2 years of age), for the most part limiting their options to the most expensive Deluxe resorts, or to having to pay for multiple rooms (or suites) at the Value resorts, most sections of Moderate resorts, and at the two least expensive Deluxe resorts (Animal Kingdom Lodge and Wilderness Lodge). In my experience, it is common for a family to have 3 children (nearly as common as families with 2 children), so it baffles me that Disney can't provide trundle beds, sleeper sofas or roll-a-way beds at its less expensive resorts, when it can do so at its most expensive Deluxe resorts (Contemporary, Boardwalk, Beach Club, Polynesian, Grand Floridian). Perhaps fire codes have something to do with Disney's policies, but it is difficult to understand why the Alligator Bayou section of Port Orleans Riverside can have trundle beds, but all of the other areas of Riverside (as well as French Quarter and Caribbean Beach Club Resort) do not have any rooms with trundle beds. For those of us who are allergic to mold, the Alligator Bayou section of Riverside is not an ideal place to stay. As the name suggests, this area of the resort is patterned after a Louisiana bayou, with dense vegetation surrounding the resort buildings, and an algae-coated bayou running right through this section of the Riverside resort. We stayed at Disney's Riverside Resort when the rooms were discounted to $96 per night, so I have trouble conceiving of how I would have reacted to this resort if I had paid the higher rates that I have seen mentioned in other reviews (I have seen references to rates as high as $250 per night.) If you are faced with paying a high rate for a room at Riverside, I strongly recommend that you consider paying a bit more to upgrade to a Disney Deluxe Resort. I felt it was well worth it to pay $96 (or $129) per night to stay at Disney's Riverside Resort, but to pay in the vicinity of $200 per night would be to overpay for this resort. At that price you might want to keep your eye out for a discounted room at the Contemporary, Polynesian, Beach Club, Boardwalk, and at either the Swan or Dolphin resorts (and if your party is 4 people or less, add Animal Kingdom Lodge and Wilderness Lodge to that resort search).", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "ky.", "Title": "\u201cBetter cleaner places to be had\u201d", "Author": "beerbellyhillbilly", "ReviewID": "UR116284177", "Content": "We stayed here for 2 days and 2 nights, and we couldnt wait to get out.

My oldest son loves the slide and my youngest had fun in the baby pool. We were there over Memorial Day weekend and it wasn't really crowded at all.

We stayed from July 12-19. I also chose Disney lodging because I wanted the luxury of being able to have onsite Disney transportation and the extra magic hours. I have a mixed review about the resort itself. Magical Express: This is an absolute bonus to have all luggage taken care of at the airport and placed in your room for you. It was quick and we were in the lobby from the airport after two prior stops. It took just about 45 minutes. Check-In: I did online check-in 10 days in advance. I had requested a mansion room and this was granted. We were placed in building 85, very close to a bus stop and over the bridge from the lobby/restaurant/ferry. We arrived just before 11:00 and our room was already ready for us, so we freshened up and took the ferry to Downtown Disney for the afternoon. Nice. Check-in took less than 10 minutes. Easy. Room: We reserved a King room as this was the only option available when I booked, and this worked out fine. We had plenty of room to spread out and unpack. There are drawers in the armoire and in the two night tables. There is a refrigerator, a tube tv that we never turned on, a very tiny safe, an ironing board and iron, and a hairdryer. There was also a privacy curtain in the double sink area for dressing and getting ready in the morning. The room was clean, but definitely showed wear on the carpet, walls, bathtub and toilet. On the fifth night, I went to get ready for bed and there was a GIANT spider on the sink sill next to my toiletries bag. I screamed and asked my daughter for assistance. Unfortunately, I'm terrified of spiders and cannot be anywhere around them. My daughter took a picture on her cell phone and my husband identified it as a brown recluse. My daughter went to try to hit it with a shoe, then turned towards me, then back, and it was gone. We nervously dumped out bags, looked everywhere very hesitantly, and then called the lobby. It was after midnight at this point and we were so tired. To make a long story short, after three calls to the main desk to get pest control (the 2nd I was laughed at by the gentleman on duty), I was finally able to talk with someone who understood that there was no way I was sleeping in this room with this spider about. By 2:30, we were finally ensconced in a double with a river view (don't even bother to upgrade to this type-the view is behind trees). By 3:00 we were finally asleep. Of course, after this mess we slept almost to noon, losing out on getting an early start on the last day of our vacation. Basically, if you have an issue with spiders or pests you will be laughed at and it could take some time to get someone to take you seriously. (As a side note, the gentleman who came to pick us and our luggage up in a golf cart was wonderfully patient and kind). Grounds: Gorgeous, peaceful, very scenic. Bring comfortable walking shoes and take care of your feet. You will walk like you've never walked before, both at Disney Parks and at this resort! Food: We opted not to do the dining plan-honestly- we just don't eat this much food or this way on vacation. We brought food for breakfast and I made a pot of coffee in the room every morning. We ate something snacky for lunch and then ate an early large dinner that kept us going until we passed out everyday from exhaustion. We ate in the cafe once here and had chicken sandwiches. They hit the spot. Also, went to the French Quarter and tried the beignets-pretty much funnel cake in a doughnut form. Staff: Mixed here. The check-in person was hardly what I have experienced from a cast member on past visits to other resorts. Efficient, yes, but hardly friendly. Was not welcoming or particularly happy I had arrived. There was no one else in line for online check-in when I arrived, but the brusqueness would have made you think there was a whole long line waiting. Ferry staff were friendly on all occasions. Restaurant staff was just fine. Magical Express staff and luggage handlers were awesome. The concierge I dealt with on the last day was less than friendly or helpful. I had a revised bill under my door on checkout day due to the room change and there was an additional night's charge on the bill. When I went to get this settled, I was told I could not recieve a bill with a -0- balance like it showed on the concierges' computer, but was assured that I owed nothing. I felt very uneasy walking out without getting a printout that showed no discrepancy on my bill, but was told that if there was an issue when I got home, that I could call a 1-800 number. He also wrote his name on the bill as further assurance. I was not told to have a magical day, a nice day, or anything else for that matter, not even an acknowledgment of goodbye. So much for Disney charm or courtesy here. Housekeeping: Towel art two nights in a row-very cute. Room was cleaned everyday. I felt they did an okay job. There was dark hair on the bathroom floor on day 2 and I'm not sure if this rolled out of a corner or what. I felt that the inital room and the double were both just okay. I understand they will be under renovations soon-they need it. Disney Transportation: A joke while we were here. We spent countless hours riding buses, some that were packed beyond capacity. I spent one late night home from MK with a woman bouncing and rubbing against me in wet clothing for close to 30 minutes-where is the concept of personal space. We also waited many times for more than an hour for a bus to take us where we needed to go-sometimes with very tight timing to dining reservations. It made for an anxious and frustrating time, and was a true downside to our vacation. We did rent a car for the weekend to go to the beach and it was wonderful to have the freedom to come and go. All-in-all, I would stay at this resort again in the future, if for nothing else than the beautiful surroundings and Disney Magical Express. I would request a renovated room. We also loved the late night Magic Hours on several nights-there's nothing like staying until 3:00 a.m. at Magic Kingdom. I would also highly recommend renting a car. Disney parking is free at all the parks while staying at the resort. I would also suggest that Disney get up with the times by giving free wireless internet like many of the other off-site hotels.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, very happy.\u201d", "Author": "ROBnMO", "ReviewID": "UR115873297", "Content": "Was at Disney as a business traveler - uncommon to be sure, but I had a great experience at this hotel.

Although the grounds were beautiful, the room was very far away from everything. Once we got to the room, the real nightmare began. Small, DARK and cheap. 2 small full size beds and a trundle. Once it was pulled out, there was little space to walk to get to the other side of the tiny room. A curtain divided the sink area from the sleeping area. Bathroom was even smaller - small closet sized. When we pulled the dividing curtain across, we realize it was splattered with... something. Odd stains on the carpet as well.

Woke up the next morning and vowed to get out of our situation as fast as possible. Spoke to the management and expressed our disgust. We decided to sink an enomous amount of money and transfer to Key West Villas.

However, the room at Port Orleans Resort - Riverside (Alligator Bayou) was just okay. The rooms aren't very big and were old fashioned.

The double pedestal sinks were nice and the small refrigerator was handy as well. Overall, the room was very average and if it weren't a disney property many people would bypass staying here. We looked at it like since we were rarely in our room and were out enjoying the Disney parks that we could accept that we were paying more for the room than it was really worth. Bus service was adequate to the parks and we went during the peak time of the year. I would recommend getting on at the South Entrance (which is by the Main check-area). If your room isn't close to this bus stop you would probably be better off using a stop closer to your room, however, the South stop is usually the first stop for pick ups and drop offs. Which means your chance at getting a seat is greater there. Overall we loved Disney our kids ages 9, 7 & 4 would love to go back - our room was just outdated and not the cleanest considering the money we paid for it.

It was a mother daughter trip and our first time to stay at this resort. I had read through all the information on the resort on this website and others and was a little nervous about what to expect. I ended up deciding to stay in one of the mansions rather than on the alligator bayou section mostly because the mansions have elevators! I did not want to carry my luggage up the stairs. Two days before our arrival, I sent in a fax to the front desk requesting to be on the top floor (I had read it was more quiet on the top floors) and in the Magnolia Oaks building. I wanted to be in that particular mansion because it is the closest to the main lobby and restaurant. We checked in around Noon and were told we had gotten the exact type of room we wanted. We were able to check in within the hour too. Our room was perfect! The only little problem was that the door on the cabinet for the refrigerator was hanging off the hinge when we got there. But I called maintenance and someone was there to fix it within 15 minutes. Our room was perfectly clean. There was plenty of light. The bathroom was small but fit our needs. We were at the corner of the third floor and had a view of the area overlooking the front lawn leading to the back parking lot. It was quiet the entire time we were there (5 nights total). Yes, we could occasionally hear the toilets flushing in the other rooms but this was really only in the morning. We traveled by car and brought a fan with us to drown out any noise. The air worked perfectly, in fact I was cold most of the time! There was more than enough hot water and the water pressure was great too. The beds were very, very comfortable with very soft and clean sheets. We had plenty of coffee and towels. And our housekeeper Luv was amazing! She left us the cute little animal towel decorations and also made pretty designs with washcloths on the sinks and side of the tub. I actually called housekeeping on our last day so I could say a special thanks and leave her a tip. My mom and I loved coming in every day and finding a new piece of towel art! I have stayed at All Star Sport, Pop Century, Caribbean Beach, and Coronado Springs and Port Orleans Riverside is by far my favorite. My mom and I had a wonderful time walking around the resort at night and swimming in the quiet pool during the day. We chose to skip the main pool because we didn't want to be around kids. There was a family who brought some very annoying children to the quiet pool, but we packed up our stuff and went to the next one and found it to be kid-free and very quiet and relaxing. Our favorite thing to do was to ride the boat over to Downtown Disney at night. It is so relaxing and you get to see some beautiful Disney property that is not viewable from any other area. I loved going by the Tree House resort for the DVC members! We ate in the main restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner and loved all of our meals. If you are in there are prime time for breakfast, you can easily carry your tray over to the fancy restaurant and eat in there where it is very quiet and beautiful. We ate our breakfast in front of the fireplace there on our last day and loved it. The food portions are huge so we ended up sharing the chicken salads and pasta meals but it was always more than enough food. The desserts were wonderful. We brought resort mugs from a few years ago (10 years ago actually) and had no problem using them for our drinks. Overall, I highly recommend staying at Port Orleans Riverside and hope we will be able to stay there again on our next Disney trip. The grounds are beautiful; the rooms are comfortable and clean; the staff is very friendly and helpful; there are plenty of pools to choose from and it was so much more quiet and peaceful than the All Star or Pop Century.

We had stayed at the Alligator Bayou section of this resort in building 14 which is very close to the dining hall and South Bus Depot and had been very happy with it before. When we arrived at check-in we were informed that the building we had requested was unavailable due to it having been up-graded to the new 'character-themed' style and already fully booked. The cast member told us that we would be located in the Magnolia Bend section of the property and gave us a map on how to get there. At first I was a little concerned because we have a 6 year old and 2 senior citizens in our group and I had read reviews about how long of a walk it was for some guests staying in this section of the resort. We drove around and found our room and opened the door and were pleasantly surprised! The initial look of the room took our breath away! It was in Magnolia Terrace building corner room 8707 and was a bit larger and brighter decorated than the alligator bayou rooms were. There was much more room inside and the lighter colored walls and up-scale lighting and theme made us truly feel like we were guests in the old gentele South. Our fears about the bus stop were quickly melted away as we saw that the East Depot was just a 2 minute walk behind where we parked. I would suggest that people arrive to their resort before sundown because we had no idea how to walk to the dining hall and main building so we we had a bit of a time naviggating the twists and turns around our building and past several pools and down a lushly landscaped path across the bridge, past old man island, across another bridge to get to the dining hall. We didn't mind this brisk walk each morning for breakfast because it is so peaceful, quiet, and lovely but be aware, you'll want to get yourself acquainted with the path you'll take for the dining hall before going on to do anything else. Good things about this resort: people here are paying for a Moderately priced hotel so the guests are very friendly and the kids were well behaved. Everyone we met was from a nice background and knew how to behave themselves very well in public. That was a plus for us because I'd heard about the noise at Pop Value resorts and rude teenagers and wanted none of that on my vacation. This had GOT to be THE quietest resort on the entire property. We never heard any noise the entire time and slept very well. In the evenings we spent many a magical romantic moment strolling around the lushly green bushes sitting under carriage lanterns on benches admiring the views. I loved seeing the bunnies late evenings the best! The bad: I did notice there were obvious nicks in the furniture and scratches which led me to believe that this furniture hasn't been replaced in many a year. Also, We were incredibly disappointed that the water never got hotter than lukewarm. There is nothing better than a very hot bath full of sore muscle bath salts to ease a middle-aged mom in the evenings and prepare her for the grueling schedule she's gotta walk and stand throughthe next day. I would highly recommend to everyone staying at a resort to know exactly where the hot tubs are at your resort and MAKE USE OF THEM as often as possible. It really helped take the pain away and prepare our bodies for the physical stamina we'd need the next day. Try taking one very early in the morning @7 when no one is there or at 11 pm when it is much less crowded. Trust me when I say that it makes ALL the difference in the quality of the vacation you will create for yourself and you're tired aching feet will certainly thank you. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed the good of this section of the resort over the few bad things and will definitely book a room here in Magnolia Terrace again and again! You just can't beat the incredibly pleasant guests nor the peace and quiet you'll find at the Port Orleans Riverside Resort.

I've stayed in both scenarios and I much prefer using the Disney bus transportation system. That being said...the Disney resorts are getting very tired and the quality is not what you can find outside the limits in other more popular branded hotels. You have to really know what is most important to you. This resort is romantic and lovely. The grounds are well kept and the feel is very Southern. Of all the Moderate Value resorts, this one has the BEST food court and the BEST value for your dollar if you do the Disney dining plan...and you SHOULD do that. It's amazing. As for the rooms...they are old and tired and they lack and sort extra comforts. Again, know what is crucial to you. If you're mainly there to be in the parks most of the day and just need a clean place to sleep, this resort is charming. If you want to splurge and have comfort, choose Grand Floridian, Polynesian or Contemporary resort. The boat ride, bike rentals and pools are terrific and the staff is superb. The food is great and the location of this resort means you don't have to wait too long on the bus system.

This is my family's second stay here. The grounds here are beautiful. We have stayed at Caribbean Beach and Coronado Springs in the past, and the surroundings here are perhaps our favorite. There is a very nice Ole' Man River vibe going on and you do almost expect to see Huckleberry Finn setting a trot line. It is marvelously lush, and in the Alligator Bayou section it gives the impression of being very secluded. The main pool is really cool with a long twisting water slide for the kids that always has a long line. This pool is always crowded, but if you look at a map of the grounds you will realize there are several pools around the resort, some in secluded areas that offer a nice alternative to the madness at the main pool. The food service is really nice and continues with the Mississippi River theme. There is a big interesting water wheel on the side of the building. Boat service to Downtown Disney is cool, but probably slower than taking the bus. You do this for a nice experience rather than convenience. Bus service is adequate if spotty at times. You may for example have three buses for Blizzard Beach or Typhoon Lagoon (water parks) before you see one for Magic Kingdom. As a result, you are in a crowded bus standing very close to strangers. The rooms are what needs work. The beauty of the surroundings belies the actual accommodations. The last Sleep Inn's, Homewood Suites (stayed in one of these in Ocala, FL on the way here), etc. I have stayed in have had far better rooms than this resort. The rooms are showing signs of age. The carpet appears worn, the bathroom fixtures are very dated. Our shower has a WaterPik shower head that does not adjust. The room is very small...two double beds, one night table in between them, and the combination TV cabinet / wardrobe for clothes. There is also a small table with two chairs. The thing that amazes me is the audacity of charging for internet service. There is no free Wi-Fi. This is a universal amenity in the cheapest of motels, but Disney cannot seem to offer it. Instead, you have to connect your computer with an ethernet cable and are charged $10 per day. I can leave the computer alone for vacation, but my wife is a graduate student and needed to complete a couple of things during the trip that required web access. Also, the ethernet cable is not situated near the table where a laptop would fit, but on the the small side table between the two beds. I am precariously balancing the computer there as I type. The cable is not long enough to reach to the table, so any work one has to do is extremely uncomfortable. Listen, staying on Disney properties (as opposed to hotels outside the grounds) really changes the complexion of your vacation. You really do immerse yourself in the Disney experience and forget about the outside world. We haven't touched our car since we got here. Disney simply needs to make their accommodations comparable in quality to the better national chains.

GROUNDS: One thing to know is this property is HUGE. It can take 10 minutes to walk from your resort room to the main pool, lobby or food court. This adds up. Say you want a quick coffee in the morning, 20 minutes total there and back, say you want to swim in the main pool (cause the kids love the slide), another 20 minutes, and then say you have a problem with something and they ask you to stop by the lobby to get a corrected statement (happened to us twice, and no they wouldn't bring it to us) another 20 minutes.... an hour of your day walking back and forth and that's after all the Disney park walking, and not even including all the walking to the bus stop at the resort to get to the parks. The grounds are beautiful, but in the beauty is a lot of creatures. The bunny was cute, the SNAKES that frequently cross the walking path right in front of you... not so much. Main pool is great. Chairs plentiful, kids loved the waterslide, lifeguards very attentive, and some games going on for the kids. ROOMS: We were in Alligator Bayou, which is where you should typically expect to stay if you are booking as a family of 5. These rooms are currently scheduled for a rehab (taking place this year and next), and they are definitely in need of one!! The look is very country, very dated and not at all our style. Mismatched, kitschy. Our room was very clean, no bugs. The room had two double beds and a pull out trundle that is pretty small, with a thin hard mattress. Our very petite 10 year old is about as big a kid as I think would be comfortable, height wise. We had booked a preferred room (closest to bus stop, food court and main pool), but when I got our final confirmation it was for a Water View room (same price, very different locations as Water View rooms are typically at the back end of the resort furthest from everything). I called immediately to get it changed and they said the computer wouldn't allow the change but it was noted on our reservation to put us in a preferred room. At check in we were told no preferred room was available and put in a Waterview room in one of the furthest buildings. Our waterview consisted of a view through trees of one of the smallest pools. If I held 2 fingers in front of my face I could block any view at all of water. I called the front desk and was able to get a refund for the difference between a waterview and standard view room (I also could have moved rooms, but at this point I didn't want the hassle). The room safe is miniscule. Considering we have experienced theft of a DSL camera at a Disney property, we were disappointed to find another room safe that would not be deep enough for a DSL (not that we brought one to Disney this time). It held an Ipad (standing up and resting kind of precariously), 2 Iphones, kids ipod, our passports and that's it, with some creative stacking (not usually something you want to do with electronics). A 13\" laptop would not have fit. It also had a key that you had to carry with you, verses the newer electronic ones you program. A hassle on the day our family split up for a boys/girls day and I got back to the room before my husband who had the key. FOOD: Food court was great. Kids Pizza is teeny tiny but other portions were big (Kid's spaghetti portion was great). We enjoyed the Pasta bar. For $10 we got a huge shrimp and chicken pasta and lots of veggies and garlic bread that was more than enough for myself and my husband to split. 2nd time we got 2 orders and fed the whole family of 5 for $20, and it was good (nice change from all the theme park fries, nuggets, and burgers). Kids loved the ice cream. We would have eaten here a lot more if it was more convenient to our room. We did run into an issue where there was a severe thunder storm in the immediate area with alarms and everything and warnings not to go outside for four hours. We were stuck in the room (10 minutes walk from the lobby) with no way to have food brought (hotel staff not helpful, not that they should have been out in the weather either, but at least they have carts to get between buildings). This would not have been an issue in the deluxe hotels with the rooms attached via interior doors to the building and room service options. BUSSES: This hotel frequently had the longest line at every park we went to. Usually 2 busses worth, meaning you waited for one bus, only to watch it fill, and have to wait for the next bus (they tell you the average is 20 minutes between busses but we found it to be more like 30). I spoke with one of the people manning the lines after Magic Kingdom closing and he said this is always the case, with Riverside having the longest line. It also is the furthest stop on it's side at every theme park. At the resort itself there are 4 different stops. It appears to be random if the South or West stop is reached first. However, when the South stop (main one by the lobby) is done first the bus usually arrives at the other 3 stops already full and you are left waiting for the next bus. Our longest wait was 50 minutes for a bus to MK, 30 minutes for one bus to arrive full, 20 more for the back up bus the driver called in to arrive... standing room only (\"great\" with kids). We had much better bus experiences staying at Animal Kingdom and Beach Club. OVERALL: We had a great time in spite of the resort. When we've stayed at Animal Kingdom, Beach Club, Poly we've had a great time added to by the resort (especially Animal Kingdom). We chose Port Orleans because it is cost prohibitive to stay as a family of 5 at a deluxe resort (at the time we booked it over $1200 more for Animal Kingdom than Riverside for a 4 day trip, because you are forced to book either 2 rooms, or a one-bedroom villa). As a family of 5 Riverside is your most budget friendly option. That said, I would not stay there again. And since Disney is reaching out to families of 5 by creating family suites that cost even more money at values (more than Riverside, for a lower category resort), I won't be doing that either. Given the large amount of families of 5 staying at Riverside (all for the same reason as us) and as many of them as were unhappy (50 minutes at the bus stop gives you a lot of time to chat and a lot of that chatting was vacationers sharing various resort complaints), I would think Disney would do more to reach out to bigger families (Deluxe category rooms for 5 for not much more than a deluxe room for 4, please). Until they do this we've been converted to Universal which is more than happy to put our family of 5 in a deluxe level room for a great price (less than Riverside), and with the addition of Harry Potter is every bit as worth visiting as Disney World.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cShuttle service was the worst!\u201d", "Author": "alphalassie2", "ReviewID": "UR114250285", "Content": "Rooms were nice/very clean, excellent housekeeping. While I appreciate the energy conservation aspect, some people like myself need the \"white noise\" of say an air conditioner or bathroom fan that stays on to drown out the flushing/doors closing/voices of others. The \"Ol Man River\" major pool (a big factor in our decision since the rest of the \"theme\" seemed less fun for kids than any of the others-look at the picture of the discarded sink at the \"focal point\" of the pool, how \"fun\" is that? ) was always so packed with people (thus overflowing our own immediately located pool-we made a lot of use of around the crowds) we never even got the chance to enjoy it-I'm talking shoulder to shoulder packed (just like the parks are). The food was very good, the \"cast members\" very pleasant, the ice makers at the beverage dispensers were always empty/near empty. The only serious drawback that would cause me to dissuade myself and others from staying here was the shuttle service (aside from the fact that a \"riverboat\" theme isn't really that exciting and the decor reflects that compared to other resorts). First of all, in spite of routes cruising by more convenient boarding depots that would serve many buildings (say hit the 4 corners of the resort instead of just 2), you need to walk to either of 2 boarding depots (although located side by side, they're considered 4 separate depots?). We'd heard that there are cameras installed to keep an eye on the crowds/people waiting, and send more if needed, and that they generally run every 20 minutes. False, false and false. Not only for the resort pick-up, but once you're at the park trying to return. As an example, on our last day we waited around 9 a.m. (along with a fairly large crowd) for the shuttle to go to Magic Kingdom while the small group waiting to go to Epcot (a separate depot next to ours) was picked up by the first shuttle, and 3 more shuttles going to Epcot arrived and departed while our waiting line (with tired kids in hot weather and a disabled person-extra time, less capacity since they roll up rows of seats to make room for the scooters/wheelchairs, requires special boarding before anyone else can board-get out of the heat) for the Magic Kingdom kept growing. That was bad enough, but then trying to return, Riverside always had the biggest waiting line, yet maybe one bus would come while several others came and departed for the other resorts. On our last day, after the parade/fireworks (closing) at least 30 of us \"tail-enders\" tired from a hot day at the park with lots of kids simply decided to take the shuttle to the Port Orleans \"French Quarter\" and walk back to our own resort rather than wait upwards of an hour. Luckily, the driver of the shuttle was able to get an \"okay\" to make a stop at the Riverside to drop us all off. Maybe 10 of the total passengers got off at the \"French Quarter\". Still doesn't seem that bad? Imagine doing so with anxious/tired kids adding at least an hour's wait both to and from the parks. (even then, walking at least a city block or more back to/from your room) The Riverside by far had the largest number of passengers, but the fewest shuttles, not planned, not monitored, not coordinated in the least. The only real bonus (aside from being very clean-I've heard many of the others aren't) of this resort is the entertainment of Yahoo Bob (hilarious). Also, I'm sure this isn't exclusive to the Riverside, but I'm a light sleeper and so the white noise of say being able to keep the bathroom fan on (instead of motion activated-I can appreciate the energy conservation aspect, but if I'd known, I would've brought my air cleaner along to make up for the lack of white noise while keeping the room cool), keep the air fan on to drown out the neighbors' flushing, shutting doors, walking by, etc. would be a huge benefit. The other minor thing would be to design curtains to pull closed away from the room so that there isn't the 1 inch gap of early sunlight (or peering eyes) facing into the room (i.e. the inside track away from the room) nothing a chip clip can't cure, but if the curtains were installed properly it wouldn't matter.", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sauk Rapids, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel and accomadations\u201d", "Author": "djpat78", "ReviewID": "UR114183387", "Content": "The service and the rooms were very nice.

We had stayed at French Quarter 3 years ago. This time we travelled with three children (6, 4, 2) and enjoyed ourselves very much. We arrived to the hotel very late on our first night. We had a wonderful surprise to be put up in the Alligator Bayou, Building 15. So close to everything - the lobby, the food court and the bus depot. We were greeted with a Mickey head on the bed. The room itself was pretty standard. It was clean and tidy but older (it is going to be going through a refurbishment soon). Since we are a family of five, we had a room with a trundle bed for the youngest; however all the children took turns sleeping on it. As a heads up to those with small children, the trundle bed is right on the floor and it rolls under the bed for space. On the third night my 2 year old was caught under the bed as she rolled off. She was yelling for help once she realized she was stuck. She sleep in the bed with me after that. My son also ended up rolling off one night but the other way, he slept on the floor for the remainder of the night. There were no sheets on the trundle bed so we used an extra blanket. Maid service was good, however I do not think it was vacuumed during our stay. She did put the children's toys in funny poses for them to greet us. The grounds were amazing, so beautiful and spacious. You rarely felt that there were many other guest at the resort. The food court was huge, lots of seating and had a great selection of food. The salads were amazing, as was the cheesecake. The children really enjoyed the pizza. The swimming pool was great, the kids loved the slide and the waterfalls. We did not find out until the end of our trip (day 9) that lifejackets are complementary and are provided near the boat dock. There are bikes to rent as well but we never had a chance to enjoy them. Disney bus transportation to and from the resort and parks is good, we only waited longer than 20 minutes a few times when returning to the hotel at park close. Leaving Epcot was a nightmare after park close, there never seemed to be enough buses for the amount of people going back. Only once did we have to wait longer than three buses (almost 45 minutes). At the resort, there are four bus depots that service the hotel (South, West, North and East) so that you do not have to walk too far depending on where you are staying. We were closest to the South depot. We did have to stand a good amount, which wasn't a problem at all. The children only had to stand a few times, other guests gladly gave up their seats for them. We also enjoyed a boat ride back from Downtown Disney one evening, it was a nice change from the buses. All in all, we had a wonderful time in Disney. The resort was nice and spacious. We didn't enjoy it much as we spend the majority of our time in the parks. I would go back to stay at this resort, but not until the rooms are upgraded. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We never received rude or unkind service during our stay.

The ages are from 4-12, but the staff really catered to each age group. The riverboat picks them up at the resort and takes them on a 2 hour cruise. It is a definite must do to send the kids on. Another great feature of all disney resorts is the purchasing of items at any theme park and having the items delivered to your hotel for no additional charge by the next day at noon.

In fact, I think I preferred it as I like the fact that we could eat at the Riverside Mill when we wanted to have lunch at the hotel. I honestly cant think of much that I didnt like about the place. Yes the rooms are a bit dated but thats the style of the property - if you want a contemporary design then stay in the Contemporary Resort or the Swan & Dolphin. The only thing I would say is that the plumbing was a bit noisy and you could hear the toilet flushing in the next room! Apart from that I heard no noise from surrounding properties (and hopefully they didnt hear us at 4am as we adjusted to Florida time). We were in Oak Manor which was about 5 minutes from the main reception/poo/restaurant. There was a small pool close by which had a laundry. This is great as you can put in your washing then have a swim/lounge by pool then go and put it in the dryer - it almost makes it enjoyable. If you're looking for a room with a view then I think most people will be disappointed as there are a lot of rooms which overlook the gardens and the carpark. Having said that we weren't really in the room all that much. The grounds of the property are really lovely and you wouldnt think it had over 2000 rooms as there are very few people walking about. Its really well designed as the pools are pretty much hidden by trees. Also there are rabbits and squirrels running about (and sometimes ducks in the pool!). The last reviewer advised not to buy the plastic resort mugs but I found them really good value as we were there for 14 days and had lots of coffee, water and juice. They are about $15 each plus tax so if you're only there for a few days they might not really be worth it. We used to get up early most mornings and head over to the bakery in Riverside Mill - they do deliciious muffins (the bran is really nice), croissants and pastries in the morning. These count as a snack from the Dining Plan. For lunch the queues can get quite busy so its a good idea to go before 12 especially if you want a few different things. There are 4 main counters for lunch: - Chicken nuggets/burgers - Pizzas/pasta - Sandwiches - Salads At night they also do some extra things. Also the cakes from the bakery are great - try the magic cookie bar and the blue cupcakes!! We got the free quick service dining plan and upgrade to the disney dining plan. We felt it was really worth it and had lots of great meals but its a good idea to go online and book restaurants otherwise you might not get to the places you want. We didnt hire a car and had no problems with the bus from the South Depot - sometimes it was the last stop but we just got off at the main reception and walked over the bridge. When you're walking for miles round the parks all day another couple of minutes wont matter. The buses can get crowded especially after the fireworks and they really pack everyone on as much as possible. It probably took 10 minutes to get to each park (Animal Kingdom a bit further) altho it took a bit longer if the bus stopped at the French Quarter. All in all we had a great holiday and this was a great property - you have all the benefits of being in a Disney hotel but the hotel itself is a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the parks. I'd definitely recommend it.", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "lancs", "Title": "\u201cAnother Amazing holiday in Disney\u201d", "Author": "kimmc77", "ReviewID": "UR112555078", "Content": "We stayed at Port Orleans Riverside for the 1st time but have stayed on disney property before.

We loved it. We have been to Disney World twice before and both times had stayed at the Grand Floridian so we were slightly wary of staying at a moderate resort. We were delighted with our choice though. We are a family of 3 (6 year old boy) and had friends over in Orlando with us although not at same resort. The room was perfect for us and also when our friend's son stayed with us too so for a family of 4, I would say it is ideal. We felt it was plenty spacious and we liked the fact we had a good sized fridge to keep drinks/fruit in etc. Housekeeping was very good and we had plenty of towels etc. We stayed in Building 95 Room 9763 and it was great. Nice and quiet and the beds were ultra comfortable which was super as we normally do not sleep very well when we are away from home but we slept like babies :-) With regards the pool facilities, the only comment I would make is that pool towels are only provided at the main pool.The smaller pools have towel collection points but no new pool towels. The laundry room was an added bonus too beside the Magnolia Bend pool. Boatwrights Dining Hall was okay - nothing special and a fairly limited choice of food we would say. The Riverside Mill was okay too and fine for breakfast or pizza for dinner etc but it was like a zoo - hugely busy no matter what time we went and fairly disorganised. If you are going to Epcot for the day, then have breakfast at the Sunny Seasons in 'The Land' - well organised and plenty seating etc etc. Twice we went for dinner at the excellent 'Flying Fish' at the Boardwalk. We were on the Dining Plan and on the whole, this worked well for us. When I booked our holiday last year, a friend (who is a very seasoned Disney visitor) advised us to make dinner reservations 6 months in advance. I thought she was mad as we do not like to be too constrained by bookings when in the theme parks etc. Oh oh - she was absolutely right! I could not get bookings to my fave restaurants (the Signature restaurants) at Disney at all and only took a booking at the Flying Fish because it was one of the few decent restaurants that had a slot for us but we are very glad we did go there. My advice would be that, if you are on the Dining Plan, book the tables at the good places you want to go 6 months in advance so that you can get decent reservation times and plan your park visits around that instead of the other way around. We had a great visit all in all. Buy some mozzy spray called 'OFF' from the on site shop as soon as you get there and use from sunset...no-one in our group got bitten :-) Also - we flew with Virgin and they have a special agreement with Universal Studios where Virgin customers can access the Harry Potter World exclusively before the park opened. Again we thought our rep had lost the plot when she said she was booking us to arrive at Universal at 6.45am!!!!!!!!!! yes you read that right!!! for access to the Park at 7am but it was a fantastic piece of advice. For over an hour, there were only around 100 people in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and we had exclusive use of this area. Breakfast was included and it was great to get photos before the crowds arrived to do the Hogwarts ride. By 9am, there were literally thousands of people heading straight to the Harry Potter section. All in all, the longest wait we had at either Disney or Universal was around 40 mins at this half term week. A lot of the rides stated waits of 60 mins or more but we didn't find this to be the case although we would advise getting Fast Pass tickets for the Toy Story Midway Mania ride at Hollywood Studios to avoid the queues.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Disney Stay\u201d", "Author": "thetravelingfam", "ReviewID": "UR111687846", "Content": "We went to Disney for my little one's 4th birthday and after much research, decided on Riverside.

The service is friendly. I read all the reviews on TripAdvisor before I made the reservation. I requested a manor house rather than a bayou lodging. I did not want to wait for hours for the bus service, so I did have a rented car. Wow, that saved time and aggrevation. Since we stayed on property, the parking is included at all the theme parks and Disney destinations. It was much easier to jump in our car which was right by the staircase to our room, drive to the parks, park and walk or take the trams to the entrances. We then also had the freedom to decide where to go next instead of worrying about bus schedules and which bus went where. One time we did park at The Magic Kingdom, but took the monorail to Epcot and back, or vice versa. Can't remember. This moderate hotel is definitely better than the Value resorts in atmosphere and comfort. Do note that whatever hotel you are in on Disney property, the layout of the rooms is exactly the same.

Port Orleans Riverside was one of the cheaper options so we decided to stay there. I was dismayed to find out after I booked our vacation that the Port Orleans French Quarter rooms had all been recently renovated and that Riverside will be undergoing a renovation later in 2011 and 2012. So basically, we were staying in a room that was in need of a renovation. I called the hotel several times before we left to make sure our room would be clean because of my son's allergies. They told me we would get a VIP cleaning, which I was happy about. I also requested a room close to the main building as this resort is rather large. I am happy to report that we were put in building 16, which is pretty close to the main building. The room cleaning was OK. The carpets looked clean, but there were dirty areas in the corners of the room and the mattresses were a bit rough looking. Since I read all about bed bugs before the trip, I made sure to inspect the mattresses very good. I didn't see any signs of them, but I did notice several large stains (coffee maybe?) That first night was rough for me as I kept thinking bugs were crawling on me. After the first night, after another inspection of the bed, I slept better. The room was cleaned pretty well each day. The first day I left a tip and it was taken. The second and third day I left a tip with note requesting a towel animal and the tip was never taken. On the last day, I left another tip. Just an FYI, if you need any sheets changed after they have cleaned your room for the day, they will just give them to you to change yourself. Not a big deal, but just know you will have to look at those mattresses again! Anyway, the food court was pretty nice, though we just ate breakfast there one day, and the restaurant, Boatwrights, was very good. One of the best meals I ate on the trip was eaten there. The lobby is pretty rough looking. The carpets are worn and the floors are scuffed up. I think they need to do a renovation on the lobby as well. The main was great...loved the slide. Watch out for pesky tweens though. They cut you in line at the slide and act obnoxious in the pool when they are together (one boy kept sticking his middle finger up to anyone who was watching.) The boat to DTD was great too. Nice little perk to staying at Port Orleans...though again, if I had my choice, I would stay at FQ for the simple fact that all the room were redone, it's smaller (half the size of Riverside), and they have a really cool looking pool! The transportation to the park was fantastic. Never had to wait more than 15 minutes and usually was able to get a seat.

There's also a walking path along the river from POR to French Quarter; we walked this a few times on our trip and found it very relaxing. We did not find the resort too big, but we do a lot of walking. For folks not used to walking much--it may seem like the resort is too big, and exhausting.

The west depot was great, since we were often the first stop int he morning and the bus was empty--or the second stop, and there were still plenty of seats. The south depot was often the last stop, and most of those people ended up standing. The pools were fun. We used the quiet pool near our building most often, and there were times when my kids were the only ones in it. We also swam at Ol' Man River Swimming Hole a few times, and really enjoyed that as well--it's always very busy though. And, once we took the boat to French Quarter to swim there (since they are \"sister\" resorts they can use each other's pools), and the kids loved the dragon slide.

This resort for us was the best value price wise. They benefits I find about staying @ a Disney resort from staying outside is 1- the shuttle buses are readily available and 2-earlier entrance to parks on certain days. I don't mind paying for quality but dont nickel & dime me. No free internet, you'll pay $10/24hr period. They only offered about 10 TV channels and 8 of them were Disney related. I'm sure this is because they want you out spending $. They have restauranst onsite which the price is about average for Disney but food was nothing to rave about. The meal plan maybe a way to save some $ but you really need to plan where and when you want to eat with it. They have a store onsite also where you can get souveniors and food (sodas, snacks and such) They do have fridge in room, so it's worth bringing some of our own beverages to have on hand. The room was clean, 2 beds, 2 sinks in bathroom, coffee maker, safe, and small table/chairs to eat at. The pool area is nice and they have an outside bar by it. At the bar, ask for $ of specialty drinks before ordering. 4 drinks cost us over $40. They do offer a mug you can buy to be used @ the resort only for unlimited drink refills. That is definitely worth investing in. You can bring in small coolers w/ plastic drink containers into Disney parks. The grounds of the resort were beautiful and they have boat you can take to downtown Disney and to the french quarter side of the resort. At this resort and maybe other Disney properties, @ check-in they charge your form of payment for your stay, instead of doing it @ check-in.

We had our 3 children - 4 yr old twins & a 3 yr old - and both sets of grandparents. Check in was painless. The resort had already accomated our request for the rooms to be near each other on the grounds. We were all in house 36. Like most of the reviews stated, this resort is spread out and you have to walk a decent distance to get to the bus stop, pool, or dining hall. That was no issue for us. We welcomed the exercise and it was always a pleasant walk in the shade. The kids loved seeing the squirrels and lizards runing across the sidewalks. The walk was often times an adventure for them. Considering we were at Disney, we spent a lot more time by the resort pool than I would have ever imagined. We'd start off early at one of the parks and be back to the room usually by 5pm. We'd throw on a swimsuit and head to the pool. I was a bit disappointed that there was no zero entry/beach type entrance to the pool and all the water was over 3 1/2 feet deep which required us to be in with the kids the whole time, but that wasn't a big deal. They did have a small baby pool but our kids wanted nothing to do with it. They had a great water slide that my 4 yr olds loved. The lack of lifeguards in the slide area made me a bit nervous, but there were plenty of parents around the bottom of the slide to keep things safe. The first day I thought the dining hall food was great... by day 7, not so much. We did have one table meal at Epcot, but other than that we stuck to our Quick Service Dining Meal. A dining plan is a must in my opinion. It was so nice to not worry about carrying cash or having to budget meals. We paid up front and were done. We learned that breakfast between 8:00 - 9:30am was the busiest and if that time could be avoided we got through there pretty fast. My kids loved the coloring table in the dining hall (so did hte adults!) and two nights when we ate, kitchen staff did a musical parade with the kids and let them make sugar cookies - lots of icing and sprinkles for a night time snack. As mentioned on many of these posts, the rooms are nothing to brag about. After reading several reviews, I was expecting worse. The rooms are average, and considering we were rarely in them, a great bargain. The beads were comfy, though by bed time we are usually exhausted. Showers were fair. I will note that the resort had a shampoo/conditioner combo. To save space in my luggage, I didn't pack my sperate bottles and regretted it because between their combo and the pool, my hair felt like sandpaper by the end of the week. The shuttle system isn't always the quickest, but I'd opt for it any day over driving myself. We had one occasion when we had to wait almost 20 minutes for a shuttle. Besides that our waits were usually less than 10 minutes. It often times felt like we couldn't have stuck one more person on, but most people didn't care, they just wanted to get to the parks. The people who complain about the shuttle have probably never had to wait in line for anything. It was tolerable, even with 3 young kids. Overall our trip was great! If you are traveling with young kids, this resort is a great option because you are surrounded by hundreds of other families with small children so embarassment isn't a worry. No need to hush them during dinner when everyone else is loud. I am not sure if we will stay here again next time we visit Disney only because I want to see the theme accomodations of some of the other resorts.

The regular check in wasn't that busy either to be clear. Check in was super fast and I was given our package and off we went to find our room. We were located in House 35 in the Alligator Bayou, which took about 10 minutes to walk there. The room was clean and quite large, some people have been harping saying the decor was dated, etc.. We didn't find that. The trundle bed was interesting, all 3 kids tried sleeping on it but they all ended up in bed by the morning. When I asked them why they moved, they didn't remember, and they said it was comfortable. Who knows... The resort is well taken care of and the pools were excellent. The large pool on old mans island was jammed with people so we kept to our own pool near our building, far less bells and whistles but the kids and my wife loved it. Holy chlorine though!! Your eyes will be sore after swimming. My only gripe about the grounds was when we came back from Epcot at like midnight we got off at the West depot and followed the path back to our building. This path wasn't marked very well and it took us a while how to figure out which building was ours. Not fun late at night with tired children. From then on we walked back to the ring road and just walked along the grass to the bus stop (5 min walk at the most) The quick service restaurant was great. Awesome selection from Burgers to Pasta to Sandwiches and it was never super busy, although we never ate breakfast there. We also ate at Boat Wrights, decent food, but my Prime Rib was severely undercooked and didn't agree with the stomach to well. I know I could have sent it back, but I didn't so its my own fault for that experience. We also used Disney Dining with no issues at all for our entire trip... All in all the staff were amazing, everything one of my daughters wore a princess dress out all the staff would bow and call them princess and open doors for them, amazing... What else can I say.

We also had some snack points left, and were able to bring sweets home with us using the points!

So, we had to work on a little more of a budget than what we've been used to. With all that said... we loved, loved, LOVED this resort. The rooms might need a little bit of a refurb, but we were so pleasantly surprised! We stayed in Oak Manor, adjoining rooms 9104 and 9105. The rooms weren't too small, 3 in one room, two in the other. They were neat and tidy... not \"run down\" at all. Mousekeeping did a fabulous job! (Don't forget to leave them a tip every day... they deserve it!) I took advantage of the online check-in and everything was ready and waiting on us. Check-in was very hassel-free, smooth, and convenient. The grounds were BEYOND beautiful! It was just a short walk to the main resort, but such a beautiful one... so quaint and peaceful. We enjoyed the quiet pool next to our resort. We had a car at our disposal, so we drove to all of the parks and to miniature golf, although we did take the boat to Downtown Disney. It was a little too chilly to do this at night in February... just go prepared with a jacket or buy yourself a neat Disney hoodie at the Disney Store to wear on the ride back! :D We had the dining plan and the food in Riverside Mill was soooooo delicious and there was an abundance of it! We didn't eat at Boatwright's since we had so many reservations at the parks and other resorts. I would definitely stay at Port Orleans Riverside, again, without question.

Upon arrival we were greeted warmly by a cast member who made the three children we were travelling with (ages 1, 3 and 5) very happy by giving them stickers and talking to them. Check in was a bit chaotic, there was 11 of us staying in 4 different rooms and it took over an hour to sort out who was going where and to issue the cards. The rooms themselves were wonderful, the housekeeping was very good and we even got a message from the manager asking us if our room was okay which was lovely. The maid made us towel animals regularly; something really nice to come home to after a long day around the parks. As has been said the hotel grounds are stunning, they are impeccably kept and make the whole experience even better. The food court was good too, a great option of quick service meals and snacks, however it can get very busy if you hit peak times in the morning (around 8:30-9) but there is plenty of seating. I would recommend buying the refillable mugs as you definitely get your moneys worth out of them. The Boatwrights dining hall is also delicious, the service is wonderful and the food is cooked well and there is a good variety. Within the hotel the staff were very kind and welcoming, saying hello to you as you pass and always willing to help you with anything you need. The Disney transport really is a dream, however they aren't very well co-ordinated. Sometimmes 2 or 3 buses will come for the same place at the same time however we were told they are working on it when we mentioned it to staff. It was a treat to be so close to downtown Disney, we spent many nights there as it is a short bus or boat ride away. A tip if you're going to be coming back to the hotel late at nigh; buy some Off! from the hotel shop, mosquitos are out in force on a night as you're so close to the water and it works a treat. But all in all, the hotel was incredible. Of course there were a few things that could be improved but if you spend your time worrying about the little things you'll only ruin the holiday for yourself.

Well, had I known more details about this hotel, I absolutely would have waited even longer to save enough $$ to stay at premium resort. Buses...horrible!!!! For some unknown and inexplicable reason, Port Orleans Riverside was the ONLY resort with painstakingly LONG lines. Our first night in Disney took us an HOUR to get home from MK. What the heck is the benefit of staying on grounds with this travel time???? Completely took the magic out of our first day. Not to mention that the buses were so crowded at that point that it was hard to avoid the hundreds of coughing kids in our faces. My husband and 5 year old had the flu by day 6. Do not waste your time here! Save the extra money to stay somewhere that is walking distance to at least one park or on the monorail line. Hint: Take a cab. We had 7 people including my parents and the $15 cab ride was WELL WORTH THE $$$ and TIME!!! I wish I had realized that option sooner and it would have saved us some agony. Food: You know, I did not have high expectations of the hotel food court. The quality of the food was okay, but I can't seem to understand why the choices NEVER changed. Night after night, the food court offered the SAME EXACT choices. We did not plan to eat there at all, but as the flu would have it, we finished our trip with two dinner at the hotel. How difficult would it be to change it up a little?? Even the cheapest hotels (homewood suites, etc) slightly change their continental breakfasts each day. Really disappointing. Pool: Towels were hard to find and people left towels on the chairs after they left the pool. No one cleared the towels to make the chairs available. The hottub was disgusting. Eight thousand unattended kids. I have three kids and I don't let them in any hot tub for more than 5 minutes (or unsupervised) since the high temps are really not meant for children. Room: Maybe it's supposed to be the \"charm\" or New Orleans, but the squeaking, bouncing bed didn't do it for me. It's 2011 for crying out loud...I'd like a quality bed with beautiful bedding. Also, we requested a connecting room with my parents, which they confirmed, and still DID NOT HAPPEN. They were next door, but not the connecting side. I don't get it.

We saw rabbits, lizards and squirrels daily. The bus service was better than I was expecting - we waited about 5-7 minutes on every occasion, except one. That one time we had a wait over around 40 minutes for an early bus to Animal Kingdom for a character breakfast. We greatly enjoyed the boat ride from the resort to downtown Disney.

I read several travel books at the library & they all said that the Port Orleans Riverside was the most beautiful resort for the Moderates. I have to agree with this one. It was very nice! The resort is LARGE & SPRAWLING but I did my research online before we went & requested a certain building to be closer to the main bus depot & food court. My request was honored & were were also given a corner room which was nice since it has 2 windows. We knew we had to stay in the Alligator Bayou section since we had 5 people. It was me, my husband, Grandma & 2 kids, ages 4 & 5. Yes, it was a little cramped but....we barely spent ANY time in our room. The room was clean & the surroundings were beautiful!! Loved all the walkways & lush trees. I only have 2 complaints & they are rather small. The a/c unit would kick on many times during the night & wake us up. Loud unit. But I have run into this at other places as well. The other thing I wish is that they had an actual \"line\" at the bus-stops. POP had an actual line but it had NO SHADE. Port Orleans had SHADE but no line. WHen the bus pulled up, everyone would just charge to the door.

We stayed 4 nights at Disney's Port Orleans-Riverside resort. Overall our family enjoyed the resort. We opted to upgrade from a standard room to a \"preffered\" which would guarantee us a room in the 4 building closest to the main building with restaurants, etc. Despite requesting building 14 we got building 15 which was indeed close to everything and the south depot bus station. I wasn't thrilled with our view of the parking lot and didn't bother to request a change. Our only real gripe with the resort was the room which we felt was just average and didn't feel that is was worthy of a \"moderate Disney resort\". Room was not that big and one of the beds was equipped with a slide our trundel bed but my wife took one look and said no way anyone is sleeping on that...as it looked pretty ratty. We ended up squeezing to kids in one double bed with my wife and I had the other with me in the other double bed. I understand that Riverside is going to be upgrading to all queen size beds pretty soon which will be a definite improvement. Despite the 5 pools at the resort, we only used the primary/largest pool on \"Ole' Man Island\" which my kids just loved! They especially had fun on the water slide and one day the staff ran a splash contest and gave out necklaces which was a nice touch. We didn't eat at Boatrights...the table service restaurant but used the quick service restaurant for a few meals and snacks which were adequate. This resort has 4 bus stops (North depot, East, South and West). I don't think we waited longer than 20 mins. for any bus (Disney's goal is for buses to run no more than 20 mins. to any of the parks). For the most part my family was able to get on the bus early enough to get seats but a few times we had to stand in a packed bus which was ok. The grounds of Port Orleans Riverside are beautiful and if our trip had not been so quick we would have opted to walk around a bit more and try the boat ride to Downtown Disney.

He was very detailed and helpful with all my questions. Withing 15 minutes I was on my way. We arrived to our room to find it as described online on the WDW site. Nothing huge but spacious enough for the five of us. It was clean and didnt smell and we had our Mickey towel on the bed which delighted my little ones. The grounds of the hotel are just gorgeous. It seems to be very sprawling but honestly its a nice walk around. Just have to not get yourself back wards as the buildings do all look alike but they are all numbered. While here we uitlized the boat to DTD, we also ate dinner at Boatwrights and also in the cafeteria style dining hall. We were on the Dining plan which was not confusing for us at all. It actually was pretty simple and quite conveinent for my family. Food was plentiful for sure. We did a good amount of swimming at Ol\"Man Island which my children loved. I happen to enjoy the water slide also. Its great to be a big kid. Yes the bedding is not \"luxury\" style but its right with the setting of the rooms. The trundel bed was bigger then I expected but my poor almost 6 ft 16yr old got stuck on it most nights as my little ones were to scared to sleep on the floor and that is where the bed stays , right on the floor.

So that made me very apprehensive of what I would find during our stay. I was pleasantly surprised. This resort is very beautiful. The landscaping is wonderful. It creates a feeling of taking you to the bayou. For being such a large resort (and we were there during spring break), we really didn't see many people, until we went to the lodge to eat. Our room was small, but accommodated our family of five just fine. The beds were doubles, but each of us adults slept with one of the kids and the third slept on a trundle bed. We were so tired at the end of the night, those slight modifications did not bother us at all. The beds were comfortable. The pillows were a little small and to puffy, but that is personal preference, as my husband loved them. We did utilize our space wisely. We set up the ironing board in the bathroom under the closet rack and used that for additional storage. There is a clothes line in the shower to hang clothes on. The curtain that separates the bathroom area from the sleeping area, although it doesn't block sound, did block out light adequately. The paths throughout the resorts were a little confusing and both my husband and I got lost a few times. Our kids were better navigators than us. From previous reviews, I would of thought from our building you would had to have walked miles to the main eating area, but that is not the case. From any building, I think the walk wouldn't be more than 5-7 minutes. The landscaping and decor is so beautiful, it was pleasant walking every time (even in the pouring rain). The disney transportation was outstanding. We never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a bus and never had to wait for another bus to come, due to overcrowding. For people who have complained about transportation in the past, I'm not sure what they were talking about. For Spring Break week, there were only a few times we had to stand while riding...but the kids actually found it enjoyable. On the one occasion where my 12 year old daughter was carrying our sleeping 5 year old, people did offer a seat to her so she would not have to stand. My only disappointment was the quality of food in the disney kingdom. The only good food I had for the 8 days we were there was pizza and a hot dog (from casey's hotdog in Magic Kingdom).

There was some confusion with our room, and we had 5 people and a baby so we needed one of their alligator b rooms with the trundle bed, but come to find they didn't have any.

I will say that the buses that come to pick you up can be an issue. They are not only very crowded and don't seem to run as frequently as they do at Kidani, I felt bad for parents who had kids and strollers.

While walking from the reception area, we couldn't help but \"ooh-and-ahhh\" all of the way to our room which was housed in Acadia House, one of the mansions of the Magnolia Bend. The resort is divided into 3-4 storey mansions along the riverside, and two storey buildings in the Alligator Bayou 'swamp' area. Whether your room is in Magnolia Bend or the Alligator Bayou, you are sure to be in a very beautiful setting. The rooms appeared to be recently renovated and were clean and very quiet. If you plan on taking the Disney Transportation to Disney World, there are four bus stops conveniently located in different areas of the resort. The Riverside Mill, located near the main reception, is a cafeteria style eating place with reasonably priced meals and snacks. It is opened from 6:00am to 11:00pm. Fulton's Gift Store is a handy place to purchase Disney souvenirs, stamps, magazines and refreshments, as well as other everyday items and toiletries. There is a swimming pool located near every building on the resort. And they all have their own features and character. The main pool provided the most shade with cozy little seating areas all around and provided pool towels, a water slide, kiddie pool, playground, hot tub and was located next to the Muddy Rivers pool bar. We couldn't get over how spotless and well-maintained the grounds were. Everything was so beautiful. If you plan on venturing to Downtown Disney, I highly recommend on taking the ferry boat. It is a beautiful and relaxing ride down the river, and you get a good view of the Treetop Villas of Saratoga Springs and Old Key West Resort. Disney World can be costly if you aren't on the Dining Plan and are feeding a family. We saved a lot of money (and likely ate more healthy) by purchasing a package of bagels and jar of peanut butter at Fulton's for breakfast. And while at Downtown Disney, we stocked up on fresh fruit cups ($1.99) from Earl of Sandwich. With freshly made and delicious sandwiches and salads for $5.99, you can't go wrong. This place is always busy! Bottled water is also costly to purchase, so we filled up our water bottles when empty. The water in the fountains at the Disney Parks is filtered and tastes great.

It was so much easier being on disney property and being able to use the bus system. The buses ran pretty regularly and stopped at four locations on the property so no matter where you were located you were a close walk. They also have boat transport to Downtown Disney which the kids love. You can do horse and carriage rides, boat rentals, bike rentals, surrey rentals, or fishing all for a fee. We didn't get a chance to do any b/c of being so busy with the parks, although we really wanted to do the horse ride. I would plan a day to hang out at the hotel next time.

I do wish the pools had been colder - after baking all day at the parks it's a bit of a let-down to hop into a pool that's the temperature of bath water. On the plus side, there are laundromats next to every pool which gives you something to do while you wait for your clothes. Bring your own laundry detergent to save some money. A note about transportation: I would definitely recommend skipping the bus system, especially if you're staying at Port Orleans Riverside. Relying on the buses is rookie mistake. The time saved waiting in the hot sun for those buses more than makes up for the $200 you spend on week's rental, particularly if you have young children. Park and hotel parking is is free and, if you book through AAA, you get access to a reserved lot near the entrance. Port Orleans Riverside is a great place if you want an upgrade from the economy resorts and not blow your budget on luxury digs. With a rented car you can get from your doorstep to the front gates of any park within 15 minutes, and it's a great place to unwind after a busy day of touring.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cGreat Family Resort at Disney\u201d", "Author": "sragaines", "ReviewID": "UR101001426", "Content": "We found Port Orleans to be a pleasure to stay at.

Upon our check-in we were surprised to have gotten a standard room with two full/twin beds when we specifically reserved one with a king-size bed. So re-visiting the front desk, we were told \"requests are not guaranteed\" and to upgrade would be an additional $25. I refused to pay the upgrade when we had specifically reserved a king size bed.

I got the PO Riverside bicycle and was forwarded to the operations center whom was unable to do anything and was once again told that \"requests are not guaranateed\".

When we visited the lodge (yet again) were lied too. The not so friendly customer service adviced us that the 1-day Florida residence deals had stopped \"like a year and half ago!\" funny...Cause I've been here several times since then and always get the pass. Luckily I called Polynesian Resort and Shades of Green to verify but somehow, they both still sold the 1-day passes (how strange). When I returned back to our non-so-wonderful hotel and called again about the passes the story had changed. Now I could get them but the request had to be made 24 hours in advance. Aside from this and the horrible \"park\" food they sell, hard beds, the pillows which are roll up and stiched into small pillows cases to make them look more \"fluffy\", outdated and nasty bathrooms, rude customer service, and the new motto \"requests are not guaranteed\", we tried to have a pleasent stay. Not to mention the fact the family members we were visiting were clear across the hotel grounds when we \"requested\" that our rooms be near each other when making the reservations. They also requested a roll out bed or slide out cot and never got that either. This place should fire everyone, shut down, be destroyed and re-build something else.

We were a family of 8 adults with 4 rooms. We came in 2 different cars at 2 different times. I arrived first in a group of 4 and we checked in early prior to hitting the parks hoping to avoid the later rush when the rooms would actually be ready. We were asked for a contact number so when our rooms WERE ready they would call us. We gave 2 different cell numbers neither one of us were contacted. We were told later by staff they never really call any way. It didn't matter TO US because we were at a park and we didn't get back to the property until around 6 so we knew our rooms definetly would be ready by then we could just go to our room at that point. That unfortunetly wasn't the case, not only didn't they assign us a room a gave us worthless plastic cards we had to wait in line all over AGAIN ! So after already standing in line in the morning we once again had to stand in line to get assigned rooms. From the minute I open the door to room 8525 it smelled musty & moldy but after being on the go all day we were exhausted and just wanted to find a place to eat and get some rest. I didn't feel like being put on hold to complain or have to be moved after 8 or 9 pm so I only mentioned it to the other people in our party. We ate dinner and simply went to bed. Hard sub standard sized pillows, stiff bedding, the bath towels were what most people would use as rags. They were old and worn, Sorry I was expecting a little fluff from Disney. The next afternoon when I was in the bathroom ( the lighting was so poor) I was looking at the wall next to the tub and I saw what I thought was blood all over it. I thought NO that couldn't be we're at DISNEY. Well It was. It was splattered all over approximetly a 21/2 foot wide ( tub to wall) to foot high , there were small spots of blood on the shower curtain, the tub and even under the toilet paper roll. It looked like some one had cracked thier head open because it was small dots of blood but there was just so much of it everywhere in such a small area. When I showed it to my husband it wasn't until then that i thought to tell him, when I took a shower that morning there was a left over bar of soap in the shower as well and I couldn't believe the room attendant hadn't throw away the wrappers from the soap I HAD OPENED. He said 'WHAT'????? He used the USED soap not knowing and we were in such a rush that morning hours prior to seeing the blood on the walls that I didn't even mention the left over soap. It was then we looked for our room attendant and asked her to come back and clean the blood off the walls,take the other guests soap from our shower. My husand was so sick about having used SOME ONE ELSE SOAP IN A BLOODY BATHROOM he called the front desk and asked to speak with a manager that's when the house keeping mgr came down to look at what we were talking about but unfortunely after 80 % of the blood had been removed by my request . The houekeeping mgr keep on insisting it wasn't blood. So I asked her what else is a brownish red and is splattered over the entire bathroom. I understand her wanting to deny the fact it's blood,but I know what I saw and I showed others in our party of 8. IT WAS BLOOD, not only that but some one else in our party pointed out that my room didn't even look like it had been vacuumed and she was right, there were plastic tags from other people's clothing,lint,stains, etc.....on our rug which I hadn't even noticed becuase I was still so grossed out over the blood on the walls that afternoon. To Disney's credit they promptly sent more cleaning staff down. We of course were gone for the entire day and when we got back the room was clean, no longer smelt like mold or mildew but it was like to little too late. When we went to check out this morning my husband was going to get ice for our small cooler and that's when he noticed we never had an ice bucket. So I called the front desk just to let them know we were checking out and let them know about the ice bucket and of course she apologized. So I had proceeded to tell her about what had transpired the day before and that this room should have NEVER been rented out in the condition it was in. We have stayed at Disney before and haven't had any problems and our rooms were fabulous but this was not to what I think anyone visting Disney would expect to be acceptable standards and was very disapointed. Having said all that. I didn't ask nor was I looking for any comps for what was a time consuming waste of time I wanted to be spending enjoying myself with family but at no point did they offer, a free ANYTHING !!!!! All I got was denial and I'm sorry. Well at those prices I expected a bit more it's called customer service and it goes along way. I would have been NICE If they had said \"you know what because of the condition of your room dinner's on us\" or even a small card with a mint on the pillow for acknowledging the filth and inconivience. It not only caused us but my entire group that had to wait on us because we had to wait for staff to get to our room or call us back. What\"s happened to customer satisfaction and service ? I guess it doesn't matter or exist anymore.......Very sad. WALT DISNEY himself would probably have been disappointed. If it wasn't for the trip advisor board other's may also have the same misfortune. I live here in Fl so I can visit Disney or any other park at my leisure but others that travel far and wide to visit the 'HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH\" After saving and waiting forever to experience Disney, Which truly is Beautiful and magical shouldn't have to waste there time or money sitting and waiting to have a room clean or cleaned the way it should have been at check in. Port Orleans Riverside is considered by Disney standards the moderately priced accomadation not the Deluxe accomadations but having a clean room should be standard accomadations not only for every hotel but especially for those we hold with such high regard.

One side of the river has 3-story old style pillared mansons surrounded by formal gardens and the other side has 2- story veranda cottage styled units surrounded by lush vegetation. The resort has a total of 5 pools, the most at any Disney resort, including a central main themed \"Ol' Man Island\" complex with a very large pool, a hot tub, kiddy pool, water slide, bar/lounge and a large play ground with climbing/slide equipment. Recreation includes rental bikes, various rental boats, and rental horse carriage rides plus an arcade. There is even rental fishing poles and Disney stocks the river with fish. Most enjoyable is the PO Riverside Boats (50 seat capacity) with 2 way transportation that takes you on a relaxing 20 minute cruise down the river to Downtown Disney. The boat runs late in the evening and the captains give a great story filled ride. Arriving- Disney picked us up at the airport-have your bar-code booklet readily available & don't worry about the luggage-Disney delivers it to the resort. I would advise you do the early on-line check-in to save time although we had no problems and received curtious & effecient check-in service. Luggage will be delivered to you with just a phone call from your room. Groceries & a baby stroller that we had ordered were ready and waiting for us at the luggage pick-up when we arrived.The room has a bar fridge for convenience of groceries etc . Our room was in Parterre Place, with 2 very comfortabe double beds, well appointed (if not a little worn) & clean; with a tub/shower/toilet & 2 sinks in a curtained off area outside the bathroom. The sink set up worked very well as one can take a shower & have privacy & the other person still has access to the sink - so it was a great time saver. If needed the drape can be pulled for privacy to separate the sinks from the bedroom area. Also the room has Internet hook-up available at an additional charge. Our group had one computer & we used it to look at the Disney Photopass pictures (another great thing -just get a card from the Park photographer & use the card to have your picture taken and then check on-line to order) and we used it to check news weather etc.The room was well maintained for the 10 days of our visit. We also enjoyed the pool at nearby Oak Manor as it was closer, warmer and quite. Meals were at the main Riverside Mill cafeteria complex. Excellent offeringings and quick; even when very busy. First, buy the refillable hot/cold mug $12. It is refillable at any resort ( not at the Parks) and is well worth the money. I suggest getting a table first before you pick up your food. We had the Disney Dining Plan-1 quick, 1 snack, 1 table service plan-we made reservations 6 months ahead for the dining supper shows etc.; character dining is 1quick or 2 dining credits which is the best way to have all the Disney Characters come to your table. We really enjoyed it all. Usually we ate a big breakfast-1 quick, and had an ice cream or drink- 1 snack, at the Park and then a big dinner-2 dining credits. We had a number of snacks left over but felt the dining plan was well worth it. Disney gives you a computer print out at the end of your visit & you can amend/adjust any discrepanies-very easy to deal with customer service as we had one small dinner mix up with our credits. The resort had a very nice gift shop and can receive packages from the Parks but expect 1/2 day wait for delivery. The Disney Card you are given at check-in has all your info, tickets, hotel key and $1000 pre-approved credit card limit that is accepted anywhere at Disney. Now for the downside- this is a 2200 room complex so lots of walking-seating space on the bus is limited and always crowded. Getting to the Parks from PO Riverside wasn't too bad but the pick up area at every Park for PO-Riverside is always the last & farthest away bus station. There would be long waits and hudge crowds for our resort when other buses came & went for every other resort. Disney needs to monitor this more closely as I have seen the same review complaint over and over about PO Riverside transportation. Disney says expect to walk approximately 7 miles per day on a visit to a Park. I would add another 3 miles for the resort and back and forths to the room, breakfast, pool, buses etc. Expect 80-100 miles of walking for a 10 day trip and many hours of standing in line. You need at least 3 pairs of walking shoes, to change them up & a med-kit for blisters etc. We had all that and my feet hurt for 4 days after I got home. Disabled people had rental scooters ($50/day) and they were marvelous for anyone with walking problems. So I would highly recommend Port Orleans Riverside but avoid the bus and rent a car-parking is free for Disney guests. A car means you can go to outlet shopping or to Universal ($40 taxie one-way). Also Disney books return airport transportation approximately 4 hours ahead for internatinal flights-sounds like a lot but the bus stops at several resorts to pick up other quests & the check-in at the airport has long slow lines. Oh yes avoid major holidays. We were there over Presidents weekend and it was crazy busy with 2 hour waits for any ride even the Jungle Cruise.

You have to collapse the stroller and therefore take a sleeping baby out of the stroller and carry onto a heaving bus - someone has to carry the baby (standing) someone hold the stroller and if you have a backpack then this too. It was awful - i saw men holding babies and double strollers on the way home whilst standing! I would rather have waited for another bus and have the stroller on a section at back than this - it was very hard work and you dreaded the journey each day.

On check in we went to our room which unfortunately was beside a car park and next to a loud generator. We called reception straight away (we may have settled for this normally , but as it was our honeymoon we decided not too). They moved us to another room immediately. The first room was within the mansion houses and the new room was in the Alligator Bayou. The rooms, although they look different from the ouside are very similar inside, with 2 double beds, 2 sinks. I would say basic but cute. The Aligatir Bayou had a theme a bit like a wooden cabin - with a log bed which we really liked. The rooms are mainly by the lake and within a lovely stroll along the lake to the reception, food hall and restaurant. We loved the hotel. There is a main pool which was great for kids, always at least 2 life guards on duty and plenty to keep kids entertained. We chose to relax by the quieter pools dotted inbetween the blocks of rooms, often in the afternoons we were the only ones around them which was blissful, another bonus is that the pools were open till midnight! The only thing i would have liked was if there was a possible room upgrade, maybe a few suites. The foodhall here is great and the restaurant is AMAZING. Try the soup and the steak. We visited the neighbouring French Quarter and were very happy with our choice of Riverside. Riverside had a lovely relaxed feel to it, it was quiet and felt a million miles away from the bustle of the parks even though it was on their doorstep. The transport to the parks was fabulous we never waited at the bus stop for more than 5 minutes. The transportation system is great and wonderful for no one to have to stress about driving and directions, you really can just kick back and enjoy the atmosphere. We visited most of the Disney hotels, either for spa treatments, dinner, breakfast or just to have a look and we felt for value for money and atmosphere we couldnt have chosen better that Port Orleans riverside.

It means you can try all the restaurants that you may normally not eat at, without worrying about daily budgeting as you have already paid for your food when you booked your holiday.

While it was our first trip I am a huge planner and had been researching Disney for 2 years so we managed to do everything I had planned during our trip and did not feel we missed a thing when we left.

The grounds of this resort are actually very beautiful so if you were coming to Disney but, spending less time at the parks and more time at the resort, this may be the resort for you. The check-in was extremely crowded. A nice man named David helped me check-in and was very helpful. I really found that throughout our stay the staff was hit or miss. You either got great people like David or people who were not so helpful so there was no consistency. Food wise we did not eat at the sit-down place but, did eat at the cafeteria area. We found the food to be just fine and comparible to similar eateries throughout the parks. Entering the room, I did not find it dated. I found it rather quaint. It was clean and we did get mouse ear towels on our first and last day. THE WALLS ARE VERY THIN!!! We heard the toddler next door every morning very early and sometimes very late. They checked out very early too so there was not much sleep for us at this resort. That being said, I assume we would encounter this issue at any resort we stayed. Our last evening some jerk was bouncing a basketball above us. I thought the family next door was annoying but, this was much worse. What was most troublesome for me since we were spending all day at the parks was the bus system. Port Orleans Riverside was consistently the longest line compared to all other resorts. Also, we had requested alligator bayou building 14 as it had been recommended highly but, unfortunately when you are coming back from magic kingdom late at night and exhausted this is the last stop (about 4-6 stops at this resort) so 99% of the time we were standing and unable to sit and so wished we had at least stayed by the first stop. It would have made things much easier for us.

At one of the parks, when I ordered a meal and paid, the cast member just handed me my change and told me to \"move forward\". I didn't get a thank you or a \"have a magical day\". What has happened to Disney??? My last gripe is that we all know how Disney can nickel and dime you, well they have stepped it up a notch to $5 and $10.

Every single night, our bus line was terribly long - one evening we waited an hour and 10 minutes at the bus terminal waiting for transportation, while other hotel's bus lines were very short and their buses came more frequently. It is frustrating to stand in line with three tired, young children, watching bus after bus to go virtually empty bus stops, while the P.O. line was stretching all the way down the bus teminal.

We stayed at the Port Orleans Riverside the last visit in February 2010. The first time we stayed at POR we stayed in the Magnolia Bend section and did not enjoy that stay so much. This time we stayed at the Alligator Bayou section and we loved it! It was alot quieter than our visit to the POR was the last time. The building was still quite a bit away from the main lobby and food court, but it was really quiet and pretty. The grounds at Alligator Bayou were quite beautiful - lots of bald cypress trees and lovely Spanish moss hanging from trees. I've been to the South and this looks very much like it. We had a nice room and the quiet pool was located right outside our door. The only downside to POR is that it takes forever to get around. The buses take forever to get there and then you have to walk quite a ways to get to your room. It is cheaper to stay at POR since it is moderate. However, we decided that we are going back to the deluxe resorts next trip which is planned for the end of this year. We've stayed at AKL, POR Magnolia and Alligator, as well as the Grand Floridian. All in all, the time that we spent waiting for buses, walking to get to our rooms, traveling on buses to get around the WDW compound, walking to the lobby/food - we've decided the extra bit of money you pay for the deluxe resorts is way worth it when you consider these factors. When we stayed deluxe, the travel time on buses and waiting were very very minimal when compared with staying at the POR. So for this reason, I would say stay here if you must because it really was a lovely resort, but splurge with the deluxe if you can. It will give you way more time swimming, park hopping, and having fun instead of spending 1/3 of your vacation waiting.,,", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wirral, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff but the room was awful!\u201d", "Author": "Disney23", "ReviewID": "UR98919333", "Content": "From the outside this hotel is great, the design is really lovely and our room was in the Oak Manor building which looked really impressive HOWEVER the room left a lot to be desired!

My family which consists of Mom, Dad and three children aged 18, 15 and 6, went on the Disney Dream Cruise for 4 days (which was fabulous) and then were booked into Port Orleans Riverside for 3 nights following the cruise. This hotel was suggested to us when booking on the Disney Site on-line by an on-line Disney representative. They assured us that for 5 people to share 1 room this was the best hotel by far out of all Disney resorts. When we arrived we were disgusted. The room was old fashioned and dingy. There were only 2 Double Beds. When I phoned the front desk to complain that the room was not made for 5 people they told me to pull a cot out from under the bed by the door. When we did this we found that there was a small cot (made for a five / six year old) that you could pull out to accomodate the fifth family member. I went directly to the Front Desk to complain, There was no way that my 18 year old daughter was staying with my 15 year old son in the same bed. The manager was very unaccomodating and proceeded to tell me that he didnt see the big deal since they would be supervised ???? What he meant by that I can only begin to imagine. In the end the best they could do for us was wheel in a normal size cot, so we basically had no room to walk around our room and had to suffer with it for 4 days. Even though we had a preferrred room, it was a long walk from the Parking Lot with all our luggage, and to the main building for the Food Court.

I took full advantage of the on-line check in, which claims to be the \"fast\" and \"convenient\" way to check on. What it really meant was that while other hotel guest had 4 attendants to assist them, our line had 2. I realized very quickly as the line for regular check in moved right along that maybe I had made a bad choice. Making matters worse, was the fact that out of the 2 attendants available, 1 was tied up with a really really upset guest. However, being an avid WDW proponent I simply thought that there were going to be some delays due to the long weekend and crowds. I made the best and finally checked in 35 minutes later. I was given very little direction on how to get to my room ( the resort is absolutely huge). When we finally arrived at what seemed to be our \"depot\" our building was not even in comfortable walking distance from the parking lot. We asked various employees if maybe we had parked in the wrong parking lot - but no body knew. Our room was located on the second floor of a two story building that did not have an elevator. I am not sure what the point of letting Disney know you are traveling with infants is - if they are going to put you on a second floor without an elevator. Unpacking was a nightmare and it just set the tone for the worst vacation we have ever had. It was nothing short of watching our money being flushed down the toilet. Don't expect the service to be any better. With the exception of a young man by the name of Alex at the Riverboat Service area, no one is helpful, no one knows anything or is willing to help. Our final straw was a Captain at the boat ferry. My mother joikingly said to him, thanks for waiting for us and he said, I wasn't I would have left had you not been at this rope when I walked up to it. Then, after having taken the ferry various times with our open stroller, he commanded me (asking is associated with politely asking and he was not) to wake my sleeping child up to close our stroller. When I complained, his answer was simply, each Captain has their own rules. I told him I would wait for another Captain. He followed that up by telling the young little boy behind me whose father was simply tantalizing his imagination by recounting pirate tales that \" THE PIRATES AREN'T REAL.\" The father was shocked. My husband then turned to him and said and you sir are not a real Captain just an old man in a costume that should not be working. I am not proud - but I must say he had it coming.

The buses to Magic Kingdom in the AM are bit crowded, try to go on a weekday. Also, try to find a bus stop near you other than the main one and you will have first dibs on seats as it will not be as crowded since the main stop is the last stop to pick-up. I have to also mention Character Dining. Whether it is Cinderella's Castle, Chef Mickey's, Crystal Palace or many others.... I would suggest to only make reservations for breakfast. The breakfast buffets are much better than the dinner ones and they are a lot less money. I recommend going to the countries in Epcot for lunches and dinners.

We arrived at 7am and they were quick to process our paper work (I did use the advance check in), and gave us our room. The staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was in building 38 in alligator bayou. It was a very, very, very long walk through a twisting path from the main building. On the up side it was close to one of the bus stops, which was made that quicker. On the first trip out we went to Magic Kingdom, no problems and when we came back to the room it was fast as well because Orleans French Quarter & Riverside had two seperate stations. That unfortunately was where the ease of the bus use stopped. For the rest of our trip we were sharing buses with French Quarters. The extra stop was not a problem at all, we still made it to the parks in reasonable time. The problem was especially at night, having to get everyone back to the two resorts from one stop. During our first night for the extra hours at Hollywood studios the line was so long it went well past 6 stops for other resorts, it was so cold that night and the line was so incredibly long we took a cab because our eight year old was miserable. For the rest of the time it was decent in the mornings, packed in the evenings and I can't recall to many times the buses werent packed to the seams with people at night... long wait and very crowded ride back to the resort. The housekeeping was excellent, clean room everyday and when we needed extra towels they brought us a huge bag full that we used through the entire week. We never ate at boatrights (which I have heard great things about), the quick service breakfast was so so, okay I suppose but a muffin in the room would have been as well. I will say if you have five people and two rooms at the value are to much and the deluxe is out of the question this is an excellent option as long as you are aware that the buses can and may very well be combined. This was what used to be a slow week at Disneyworld but it was not for the buses at Port Orleans and for this I will never stay here again, but it is clean, comfortable and the grounds are amazing.

Riverside was one of the places that did allow 5 in the room. It was very nice looking place but not practical in the least. You enter the main hub of the hotel and everything looks great. Everyone is so nice and helpful. We did the online express check in and it was anything but express even at 10 at night. Once we received our room cards they told us to go out back and follow the map. A half a mile later through a bunch of twists, turns and bridges we finally arrive at our room. I'm not kidding, at least a half a mile walk. So for the rest of our trip if we wanted to go to the main pool or to the main dinning hall we had to walk all the way back. The only nice thing about being way out there was we were closer to the one bus dock to catch the buses to the parks. The room is small but what do you really need except for a place to sleep. No microwave or DVD player. Just a TV, Dorm size fridge and a coffee maker. The room was clean and the daily service was excellent. New towels, extra pillows, extra blankets whatever you needed. When we first walked in the room there were only two beds so we called to make sure we had the right room for the 5 of us. They told us to look under the one bed and we started to laugh. There is was, a pull out roller shelf with a mattress on it! That was the 5th bed! hahaha Thankfully our 5 year old was cool with sleeping on the floor on this tiny mattress. They did have a bunch of channels on the tv. The air and heat worked great. I would bring a power strip like we did to plug in all your camera's, phones, DS's etc...as the outlets were limited. Also, don't expect to find any luggage rollers. You either have to carry your luggage to your place or have he bell service drop it off. We were part of the disney express so the luggage was delivered to our room at about 2 in the morning. Leaving however was ridiculous. We called an hour before we had to check our luggage in to be taken to the airport and they were too busy. Now it was raining about an inch an hour so I had to walk my luggage to the front. That's right, a half mile with two large bags of luggage in the pouring rain. Needless to say I was soaked when I got to the front and when they asked me how I was doing I told them crappy (not the actual word I used but I couldn't use profanity in my review). They were then able to find someone right away to go and retrieve my family and the rest of our luggage. Make sure you have a bunch of 5 dollar bills handy. From the bus guy that drops you at the hotel and back at the airport, to the bell service both coming and leaving, to the room service, to the luggage check guys everyone has a hand out for a tip. I'm not knocking it just giving you a heads up. The food in the main dining hall was pretty good. Then again after a half mile walk I would have eaten just about anything! haha You can catch a ferry at the back of the main hotel to downtown disney which was nice. You could also take it over the Post Orleans French Quater which looked like they had a nicer main pool. That reminds me that we were back at unit 35 which happened to have their own little pool right there. That was nice even though the kids wanted to go all the way to the main pool since it was bigger and had a slide and jacuzzi. That is also where the bar was. I was going to have A beer but wasn't about to pay $7 for it! Towels were availabe too which was also nice. Internet access was also $10 a day if you wanted it! Good think I had my iphone! Needless to say I would not come back to this hotel nor would I ever recommend it to anyone. For the few positives it had the distance to the main hall and pool was ridiculous especailly with 3 kids.

I have stayed at this resort when it first opened as Dixie Landings and thought (in those days) that it was great. Yes, it is beautiful on the outside and the rooms weren't bad on the inside either, although at the Deluxe resorts, you get, 2 bars of soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion, at this resort, there was just a bottle of combination shampoo and conditioner and one soap, that you had to take from the sink when you wanted to shower. (Disney -- do you really think a guest doesn't notice these things when they are return guests?) Transportation was okay, however, at times Port Orleans-Riverside does have 4 bus stops and at times, it shares a bus route with the French Quarter. If your room is located at the last stop, my advice is that you either walk to or drive to the Main Bus stop. The Food Court used to be the best on Disney property, however, compared with then, now is it is barely adequate. (Disney, you make tons of money, why do you scrimp?) My problem was with checking in. I had booked the room months in advance, requested a ground floor room with a king bed, because I do use a wheelchair. When we checked in, we had been assigned a room on the second floor of Alligator Bayou -- which has no elevator. The front desk cast member told me there were no other rooms available and I had to insist that we can't \"do\" stairs with a wheelchair. It took the front desk manager an hour and half to find us a available room, which was still not ground floor, but at least it was in the Magnolia Bend section, which had an elevator. Needless to say, I was annoyed because we were just there so we wouldn't have to drive home after MVMCP, and at this point, it was getting so late and I didn't want to miss the party. We finally got to our room, after all the winding corridors, dropped off our overnight bag, and drove back to the Main Bus Stop to head over to the Magic Kingdom.

The room was clean and pleasant. We had five people so we had a trundle bed which the kids actually argued about who would get to sleep on it. The location of the room was convenient with a short walk to the bus stop, pool, and parking lot, and about a five minute walk to the main building. As with any Disney hotel they do an impeccable job with the landscaping and we really felt like we were in the bayou. The main pool is very nice but it is busy and we spent a lot more time in the pool closest to our room. It was warm and quiet, and the kids loved late night swimming there. The dining hall is big and airy. Breakfast was crazy in there and we had a few days where we had to practically mug someone to get a table, but other meals weren't nearly as crowded and the food is good. We utilized the early online check-in but it didn't really seem to save much time at when we got there, but either way, it only took about 15 minutes. The game room is awesome, but we were so busy we didn't get to spend much time in there. While there we rented a boat which I highly recommend. The staff was all very friendly and the girl who cleaned our room was wonderful. The bus lines can get very long and although the bus service is convenient, sometimes coming home from the parks can be an absolute nightmare. If you stay until closing you'll get on a huge line to go back to the hotel and sometimes wait as 3 or 4 buses come and go, then when you finally get on one they pack you in like sardines. Halfway through the trip we decided that since it is free parking at the parks if you're staying on property, it was better to drive since we had a car. We have stayed in the Disney Value hotels at least 10 times and while they are also very nice, the Port Orleans is a big step above. For the people who say that the Coronado or any other Moderate Disney hotel is nicer, well of course it is, it costs twice as much or more. As far as a decently priced Disney hotel, this one is great. If you're going to Disney, staying on property is the way to go, and we have utilized their free dining plan offer three years in a row and it is WONDERFUL.

I did that and requested a top floor in the Alligator Bayou section. Upon my arrival, we were given a first floor room in the Magnolia Bend area right in front of the main walkway by the main pool.

Apparently, it had been sitting at the resort and they just hadn't gotten it to us. It was finally delivered at 11:00 that night. The next day, I called the manager at the front desk and he was able to move our room to our requested area. The rooms are not real clean. The first room we were in reminded me of a room at Motel 6. It was just old and the floors looked like they hadn't been scrubbed in a long time. When I'm paying extra for a Disney themed resort, I expect the room to reflect that. The theme of the outside of the resort is apparent and the grounds are nice. The resort is very spread out, so expect to do a lot of walking. Also, I was not aware that the Pop Warner Football/National Cheerleading Championships were the same week we went (Dec 4-11) and Pt. Orleans Riverside is the host resort.

My daughter is 10 but still gets excited to see what towel animals we have been left, the only one we got in the nine days we stayed was a snake which obviously didn't take much effort to make. Other than that breakfast was a complete nightmare so busy, queues for food, queues to pay and nowhere to sit. After the first day we had to split up and stand in different queues just to get our breakfast over and done with in about an hour. After returning from breakfast one day we found a maintenance worker in our room, I tried to get in to the room with my card but after three attempts I shoulted to my husband who was a few steps behind me to get his card out as mine had stopped working, at this point my door was opened from the inside by the female maintenance worker, who told us she was fixing our door! We had been in the room for five days at this point and had not reported a problem but thought nothing more of it and got on with our day. The following day I went to the safe to get out some money and found my wallet all open and I knew I had not left it like that so I checked our passports and money and found both us dollars and English money missing. I immediately went to the reception and was told a security guard would be sent out to me to take details of what had happened, the security guard was at least 70 and I had to repeat everything three times for it to sink in. I left it at that and tried not to let it ruin my holiday but the day before I left I went back to reception to see if they had an update as no one had been in contact we us since the incident which I thought was not very good customer service. A manager was bought out from the back to see me who informed me that they had no record of the incident so I had to waste yet more of my time going over everything again. I described the worker and she contacted the maintenance department to confirm that that was one of their employees, then she checked the computer and found that there was no work order so she shouldn't have been in the room. Then the manager called the sheriff so I had to go over the story again. The only two people who had access to my room were the cleaner and the maintenance worker and since the safe was locked and the key hidden the money didn't sprout legs and run away.

Though it is the busiest week of the year the transportation was wonderful. However, due to the crowds and the high prices, I won't do Disney again at Christmas. This is not an issue with the hotel, just my opinion. For those looking for a place to stay at Disney I recommend the Port Orleans. There is one issue though I was unhappy with unrelated to the hotel, but feel it should be stated. The meal play is really not as good as it used to be. In 2007 your sit down included an appetizer, meal, dessert, and tip. Now it is only meal and dessert. That alone adds 20 to 30% to your food bill.

Once at the desk I was greeted by a rude woman from France who I had trouble understanding due to her hard accent. We were traveling with two other groups, and requested rooms close together. Two buildings away must be their definition of close, and when I requested a different room I received a look that could kill, and had to wait another 15 minutes for her to accomplish my request. Upon entering the room, we were greeted with a musty septic odor which we all found gross. The odor eventually went away, but you never get a second chance to make a first impression. We found the rooms to be very dated, and had the overall feel of being dirty. We found papers from the previous visitors on the shelf, and the shower that would not shut off all the way was like water torture during the night. One of the two sinks drained very slowly making it unusable, and after two calls to maintainance I gave up. I found the house keeping staff to be very rude, and this was not just one person having a bad day- it was every time you had to communicate with them - like when you return from breakfast ant they are in your room and you want to get your things for the day. I have been told to come back later by cleaning staff- It happened here. Overall I found the staff to be rude, and acted as though you were bothering them even if you asked something simple like directions to the bus stop.

There is only one Disney and people will still go even if they built shacks for you to stay in. Here's what I experienced during our stay 12/24-1/1 Pro's: 1. Gorgeous landscaped grounds with nice wide walking paths thoughout the property. 2. Decent hotel staff. Young and somewhat inexperienced but cheery. In fact, most folks on staff are either very young or very old. I understand Disney doesn't pay well. 3. As a previous reviewer said, the buses were very convenient. Running anywhere from 20 minutes to every 10 minutes. 4. Boat shuttle was very enjoyable but doesn't take you everywhere. From the Riverside the main destination by boat was Downtown Disney. 5. The temperatures dipped into the 30's but the outside pool was heated. Pretty cool. 6. The Boatside restaurant was decent but as with everything at resorts overpriced. The cafeteria was the best deal. Breakfast was totally not worth it. They count the number of bacon they give you and nothing is outstanding although the made to order omelet isn't bad. The lunch and dinner are far more worth it. Cooked to order pasta and a carving station with turkey and roast beef (I think). As a quick meal from the meal plan it's hard to beat. Con's: 1. Rooms are seriously in need of renovations. Our rooms had the following problems: a. A/C/hearing unit really smelled bad when used in heater mode. b. Shower head leaked c. Shower vent fan stayed on intermittently and rattled. d. Coffee cups were used (go figure) e. There was tape over our telephone for no reason (go figure again!) f. Tube tv's! Flat screens have been around for years!!! g. Distance to rooms from lobby is quite a walk and we were situated in one of the closer units. 2. The bus drivers aren't very sensitive to older handicapped folks. My dad was in a wheel chair up to the bus' door and walked into the bus. All the handicap seats were taken up by young kids and parents. The driver made no effort to find a space for my dad. Happened constantly. 3. While it's cool to be here for Christmas and New Year's I would never do it again. The crowds are crazy. It's a huge place and when you walk you are shoulder to shoulder with people. Unbelieveable. 4. Distances to each park is very far. The bus rides took anywhere from 15-20 minutes. 5. Many of the park workers don't know much about anything. We tried to ask folks about the Magic Hours times and got six different answers. If you plan on using a meal plan take the time (which will be a lot) to research the different restaurants you can go to. It seems as though the better restaurants are at the parks and not at the hotels. Planet Hollywood and the Irish Pub were excellent. Places like Sanaa were just okay. If I had to do this over again I'd go off season and probably go to the California Park and stay off property. There are far better lodging alternatives than Disney properties.

Christmas Day had buses going to and from Magic kingdom every 10 minutes. That was really appreciated. -The boat to downtown Disney is great. I highly recommend it over the crowded bus to downtown . Again the buses to the parks were good but downtown not. - The staff were all really nice right from our early arrival at 11:00 am being able to check in with our room ready. - The outside area of resort is really attractive. - Daily housekeeping was good -Fulton's General Store is adorable and fairly well stocked Cons: -The rooms seriously needs an overall. The interior is really dated. Reminding me of an older Best Western -Grout in tub surround was discoloured -Room smelled really old and musty -We actually had two adjoining rooms. One of the rooms seemed to be in better shape than the other, maintenance wise. -Daily internet fees: Highspeed internet(not wifi) 9.95 for each 24 hour period(not unique to Port Orleans) -Food Court: This was prob the worst quick service meal we had in Disney. The portions were small. Food was only lukewarm in temperature. I just felt it was not good food. I should add we only ate breakfast here twice so maybe other meals are better but a complimentary breakfast at Homewood Suites beat this hands down. You are much better off going to the Main Street bakery in Magic Kingdom and getting a breakfast sandwich along with a drink and baked good(I gave the cinnamon bun to my son who is a light breakfast eater) and saved a quick serve and snaack on my dining plan to be eaten at a more convenient time. If you're going to Epcot for the day, go to the French Bakery and get the ham/cheese croissant. This counts as a snack and is way better than the bounty platter or french toast you get at Port Orleans. -The only thing I really feel this hotel has going for it is the resort grounds are beautiful, and being a Disney property you don't have to worry about transport at all. I really liked the all inclusive feeling. Again though you'd get it at any Disney property. My husband seemed to like Port Orleans better than me.

This is by far the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at. I travel alot and have never felt compelled to write a review, but this time felt that I needed to make my awful experience known. And NO...I am NOT a complainer, but the customer service at this hotel was nothing but AWFUL! When arriving at the hotel I proceeded to stand in a line that took about 30 minutes to check in. Upon checking in, I noticed that all of my information was incorrect and that they had my name completely wrong. OK ...after being exhausted and tired with 3 young children, I just dealt with it. We were told that we were staying in Alligator Bayou Building#17....a far distance from the lobby and food court for a family with an infant and 2 other small children. Not only was it far away,but the layout of the buildings at this hotel is extremely confusing. The girl at the desk gave us a map and told us how to get to our room.....30 minutes later with 3 children and 5 suitcases in tow we found it. Not a great start after just arriving after a 3 hour flight and being exhausted and tired. The rooms were outdated and just gave the overall appearance of being unclean. Crowded room for a family of 5. We used the trundle bed and a pack and play, and it was much too crowded. During that first night, when we were ready for bed,we noticed a terrible constant noise coming from our refrigerator. Our family did not sleep all night.!!! In the am i walked directly to the front desk @7:30 am to inform them of the problem. They said that they would get someone there by 11:00 am. Nobody showed up.... Needless to say, 2 calls were made that afternoon to AGAIN remind them of the problem and nobody showed up. Everytime that I called, it was like I was calling for the first time. Nobody at the front desk or maintenence dept. seemed to know what was going on. I was trying to get this problem resolved before night time and nobody seemed to care. I finally gave up, because I just did not have the time or energy for it. I wanted to enjoy my vacation with my family, not spend it talking with the most disorganized and apathetic staff that I have ever come across. Suddenly at 9:30 at night someone shows up @ my door to fix my Air Conditioning. The maintenance dept. had the wrong message. I was so excited to finally have someone from maintenance come, that I told them what the real prob was and they then informed me that it was not their job and that I needed to call housekeeping. I decided to do that in the am and deal with another night of no sleep. We were all attempting to sleep when I heard a knock on the door @ 10;30p .....it was someone from maintenence coming to exchange my refrigerator. Half asleep, I told them to come back in am. Needless to say they woke up the baby who spent the next hour crying . Next day ...nobody showed up again...and guess what...I gave up trying! I unplugged the refrigerator and dealt with it the rest of the night. My daughter had a 24 hour virus 3 days into our trip. At night, she had vomited all over her bedspread and blanket. I took the dirty linens off of the bed, and she slept with only a clean sheet the rest of the night. Next am I told housekeeping. Our family went out for the rest of the day and came back 8 hours later to find one bed mad and my daughters bed untouched. They would not even chang ethe sheets or touch the bed that she had vomited in. When I called, someone was to be sent right away. I left and came back a 1/2 later to find a pile of sheets and blankets waiting for me. I guess that they had expected me to make the bed and change the linens. I called again. The gentleman was flustered and visibly angered and said that some one would be righ there after she finished another room. 10 minutes later I opened the door to an angry hostile woman. She stormed into the room and would not make eye contact with me. She was obviously angry with me for calling. She proceeded to mumble to herself under her breath. I decided that I would just remain quiet, in order to get her out of there as fast as I could. Sorry If I asked her to do her job!! She proceeded to ask me to hand her the sheets individually as she made the bed. She then left in a huff. I would have stayed in a Motel 6 for that kind of treatment! and would have made the bed. Luggage check in at the end was just as eventful.. The gentleman basically called me a liar to my face before I left when he gave me misinformation and I verbatim told him what he directed me to do.

We decided to stay at a moderate resort this time. Previously we have stayed at the Contemporary, Wilderness Lodge and Grand Floridian. We arrived on a bad day for Disney because their computers were down. The lines were long, but we were able to get through in 20 minutes...until we realized that our reservation was not correct. We called POR, because we left to eat lunch and they made the changes we wanted. A room in the Mansion Area with a water view. Our experience with Disney is they do their best to accomodate their guests. The walk from the parking lot to our room was long the first time, (especailly pulling luggage) but then our girls found us a short cut. The room itself was felt spacious, was clean and decorated traditionally (just as you see on the Disney's site). We were greeted with a Mickey towel shape on our bed. We had no problem with Mousekeeping, room was neat and clean each day. As for the food court...we preferred the French Quarter over Riverside. It was smaller, fewer guests and our food was hot. Loved the Po' Boy sandwiches for lunch! It was quite cold the week we stayed but our last day we did get to swim a little. The girls enjoyed the slide and landing in the \"warm\" pool! The grounds were beautiful and serene. There's a quiet, slow pace which we enjoyed. The parks can be soooo crazy. We rented a car (we have tried several combinations and feel this works best for us) so we had no bus issues. The only reason I marked the service down was due to the computers being down...I would stay here again. Lastly, we had a really, really loud family next to us...they came in at 1:00 a.m. with small children...one of them screaming for chocolate...I called the front desk and security was dispatched immediately. The family was warned to quiet down or they would be \"removed\" from the hotel.

The housekeeper we had the entire week throughly cleaned our room everyday, left us new towels with some on the bed shaped as mickey mouse and Dumbo. She even cleaned our coffee pot and was able to get us a microwave to use in our room. Room service was extremely quick; we received the extra coffee we wanted in less then ten minutes. All of the Port Orleans staff was cheerful and polite. In the quick time area, the staff went out of their way to start conversation while we were waiting and line and they all had a smile on their faces. The Christmas decorations were gorgeous and we got to take a picture with Christmas Mickey on Christmas Eve Day in the morning, go on a carriage ride for 30 minutes for $45, shop in the general store, and play in the arcade with our arcade voucher. We did not really run into the quick time meal crowds, because we got up early and got breakfast at the hotel by 7:30, 8:00 each day and we would get supper about 4:30. With the buses, the same thing. We got up earlier and missed most of the big crowds. Here is a tip for those who are into the Magic Kingdom and want to ride the rides without waiting forever: If you are able, don't get to the park until 8:00 or 9:00 at night and stay until it closes. We were able to re-ride all of our favorites and get on rides that we had not rode yet in a lot less time. The wait time was anywhere from 20 for the big thunder mountain, 5 minutes for Pirates of the Caribbean and Its a Small World, no wait for Aladdin's Magic Carpet Ride.

My wife and I stayed at the All Star Sports last year for a week and felt that the Port Orleans Riverside was only marginally better. We felt as though the difference in price did not translate into a significantly better experience. Rooms: We felt as though we were staying in a 2 star motel. The room was very dated and looked like it was in need of a major renovation. The carpets were soiled and looked like they needed a thorough cleaning. There was little overhead light in the room. The bathrooms were very dated and didn\u2019t feel as though they were that clean. I know that on a Disney vacation you typically don\u2019t spend much time in the room, but when you are spending $150+ a night for a room in Orlando where there are many options to chose from, this room simply did not cut it. Grounds: Well kept. Location: The location was on the resort so you had access to the Disney buses. This worked out well with minimal wait times for the bus. Conclusion: Fortunately we only stayed at this resort for one night. We spent the other 2 nights of our trip at the Hilton Garden Inn Seaworld which was half the price and significantly better. The rooms were larger, updated, and it was convenient to I4 (which allowed us to travel back to Disney with ease.) I only mention this hotel to demonstrate that for amount of money we paid for the Port Orleans Riverside we just felt the value wasn\u2019t there.

I had very high expectations based on the Disney web site, reviews and the friendly phone reservation attendant. We spent our first night in Orlando at the Hard Rock at Universal and loved it. From the beginning, the Port Orleans stay was a disaster. They were upgrading their computer system the day we checked in (without any advance warning to us). The system was up and down all day. Even though we completed the online check in it took us one hour to check in on site! They couldn\u2019t \u201csee\u201d our reservation since it wasn\u2019t accessible so could not honor any of our requests and no upgrades were given on this day. We checked into our room to find the bathtub almost overflowing with water. We pulled the plug to let it drain but had to call maintenance due to the constant drip of water. The maintenance man finished but left the tub dirty with debris. The cleaning staff did not follow up. The room was small and dark a stark contrast to the comparably priced Hard Rock. When I went back to complain about the entire experience up to that point, I received no apologies or sympathy from the front desk manager. The check-in area was filled with angry guests. They would not let us change rooms and offered up nothing for the inconvenience. One definitely got the feeling of the customer as cattle - move em in, move em out - without any regard to hospitality. Many of the front desk staff were inexperienced, grumpy, and were not given any authority to make any decisions. With each complaint, and there were many, the staff would excuse themselves, go to a back room for 4-5 minutes or so and then come back with an apology that there was nothing they could do. The next day our single key card stopped working (yes, one key card for a family of four). We didn\u2019t have time in the morning to deal with it since we needed to head to the park. Upon returning, I had to wait in a line at the Concierge desk and heard many raised voices with a common refrain of \u201cthis is unacceptable!\u201d Apparently the meal plans were also really screwed up and not recognized. People who paid in advance were forced to fork out money for their meals and save receipts for reimbursement. This time, after relaying my experience once again, I received four key cards with family members\u2019 names printed on each and a credit for a half a night\u2019s stay (of course this after the staff\u2019s 5-minute consultation with their supervisor). When we noticed kids walking around with \u201cFirst Visit\u201d buttons, I went back once again to ask why we had not received them. After waiting in the concierge line for an hour (I know, over a stupid button, but this was my kid\u2019s first visit!) and sharing horror stories with other disgruntled folks in line, I was finally helped by a triage staff who approached me as I was at the front of the line and simply got me the buttons. Why they didn\u2019t think to send somebody out much earlier to triage the line is anyone\u2019s guess. How long have they been in this business??

The hotel was close to the parks so we didn't have to wake up early, we used the restaurant for the breakfast only once, and had good omelets. There is a good shop, near the lobby where you can buy milk,soda etc. as well as good souveniers. We used the car we hired through Traveljigsaw(it was Dollar Rent a car) for going to the parks, and never had much problem in parking.

We had a lovely view of the river and the mill. We got ballons delivered to our room when we where away for dinings one evening wich I thought was a great gesture for our daughter that turned 5 years old , I had asked at the qonsiuer about that.

The bus service if staying here and going from the parks back to the room You should expect the bus to go to the other places before the reception area , wich took abit of a time. The buss\u00b4s filled up and was a bit to crowded for my liking and very many times we where standing from the parks and back home, and I didn\u00b4t feel very safe about that, so we ended up taking a taxi to many times.

To keep things brief... The Magical Express service was great, we checked our bags at our home airport and didn't see them until a few hours after we checked in. Our check in was very smooth, we didn't know about the on-line check-in, but it still only took us about 5 minutes to get through the process We were in building 37, which was about the farthest away from everything, and had a corner king bed room. It was about a 5-8 minute walk to the main building, so although the resort is large, it's not unwalkable. If you have a disability, I would suggest a building closer to main building. The room was laid out fine, but there was some cleanliness issues with a little mold in the tub and our ceiling fan was very dusty. We had no issues with neighbor noise, although we thought they were banging on the wall the first night we got in only to find out it was firework percussion... :) We thought the food court was average. We were split on the cinnamin roles, the waffles were good, the coffee and fountain soft drinks were poor because of the water used. We didn't eat at the table service restaurant on-site. The lounge has a good variety of drinks, as did the bar lounge. The Disney Transportation was bad this time, we waited up to a half-hour for bus transportation at times. And our bus stop near our room was the 2nd to last on the runs so you had to plan accordingly. We used the main stop most of the time, and sometimes the buses only went to that stop. We used the water taxi several times to Downtown, they run every 10 minutes after 4:00pm. It's about 20 minutes each way to go this route, but it's nicer than the bus. We had a situation where we left a bag at a restaurant, and when we called the restaurant from the conscierge desk we were told they had it and were sending it to lost and found. The conscierge was very unhelpful. We asked, since the restaurant had the bag and knew it was our if they could ship it to our resort or hold it, and she said it was policy to send to lost and found. We went to lost and found the next day and they didn't have it, and said since there was food in the bag (chocolates) they wouldn't keep it anyway so it never was going to go there. This really annoyed us. The pool was nice, the hot tub small. They have towels at the pool which is helpful, and the bar there was nice. The grounds were well manicured, although there appears to be a lot of standing water on the property. Check-out went well, but not wonderfully as the computers were down. Again, we checked our bags at the resort and didn't see them until we got home which was great. If I had to rank the moderates I've stayed at - Coronado Springs, PO French Quarter, Carribean Beach and then PO Riverside would how I would lay them out, but Carribean Beach was quite a while ago so it may have slipped.

The resort is very well kept, there always seemed to be armies of men painting. We went in October 2007 for a 'once in a lifetime' holiday with First Choice for 14 nights. After reading reviews we decided to go for this one as we are light sleepers and value resorts had 'thin walls and large groups of loud teenagers and sports groups'. The French Quarter is best, better pool, not so sprawling, cheaper food court than Riverside, we stayed in block 2 close to pool and food court, still quiet at night. lovely walk along the river to Riverside. we also booked the 'Disney Dining Plan'. The first time we went we didn\u2019t know you had to book restaurants in advance, we managed to get most of what we wanted but ended up eating quite late and in resorts as parks were booked up, but this turned out to be good because we might not have thought of going to other resorts before and it really does add a new dimension to the holiday as the resorts are so interesting. I also like being nosey! We booked to go again 2 days after we got back, still jet lagged! We found a good price, \u00a31,000 less than the one we had just been on for 3 weeks with free dining! The only drawback was it was in August and very hot, we also had 5 hurricanes in the 3 weeks, including the one we had to do an emergency landing in! we got diverted from Sanford after nearly landing for an hour (ran out of sick bags!) to Orlando International, and had to sit on the tarmac for 2 hours, (the plane, not us). Also very busy in the parks (and Magic Hours were very late, sometimes 12 midnight to 3am!) for 1st 10 days, after 1st September Q times were slashed. When we were on the 'Sorin' ride we saw Disneyworld all lit up for Christmas and i thought...... So we went again in December 2009. Again in the French Quarter this time block 3. I actually booked a cheap hotel with flights with TCD, (\u00a31,300 for 4 of us!) but decided not to stay in the cheap one and booked the room direct with Disney, only \u00a385 a night for the 4 of us with free counter service dining! Its well worth booking a Disney resort to get free dining, at low season the room is only \u00a385 - \u00a3100 a night for 4 people with free lunch ($50) evening meal ($100 - $130), and 4 snacks ($8 - $20) nearly $200 = \u00a3150.00! Also Magic hours are worth the extra, day time 60 - 90 min wait, evening Magic Hours walk straight on! If you stay in a moderate resort you get free counter service dining. We paid for upgrade to table service last time but it is actually the same price to stay in a deluxe as it comes with table service. (We have booked Saratoga Springs for next year).

I traveled with my mom, my 2 yr old daughter and my husband. We stayed at Port Orleans from October 1st-October 8th. We loved our stay at Riverside. The weather was perfect! 80's and low humidity. The Magical Express was awesome. BUSES: We did not have to wait long for the buses to and from the parks. We did not stay during peak season though. ROOM: We stayed at Oak Manor in the Mansion Section. The mansions are beautiful on the exterior. The rooms on the inside are average, but clean. They remind me of a bed and breakfast room. The beds were comfortable. BUGS: The only thing I complained about to my family was those love bugs. You will see them in the parks, on the resort and outside your room. They will fly in the room when you open the door. I killed like 10. I hate bugs, but it was not too bad. I just had to shut the door, spot them, and kill them. I'll take Love Bugs over Bed Bugs any day. RESORT: The resort itself is beautiful. The landscaping was breathtaking. I loved the river, the pathways, the trees, and watching the ferry pass by. The scenery make you feel so relaxed. POOLS: My husband enjoyed swimming at the main pool at night, but it was too cold for me. I loved the hot tub by the main pool at night. It was HOT, but felt good after a long day at the parks. We all swam in the quiet pool at night. The water felt cold, but It probably feels nice during the day. FOOD: We all enjoyed eating at both food courts. Riverside had alot to offer. Make your own pasta, deli sandwiches, pizza, and a bakery.. French Quarter has a great cheese steak. My husband and I loved it! The Beignets were okay. I never had them before so I have nothing to compare them to. I might have enjoyed them more with a cup of coffee. NAVIGATING: The walk to FQ was nice. I never got lost or confused walking around either resort sides. If you did get lost, there are signs everywhere. LAUNDRY: We did laundry while we were there. It was located in a close and convenient building by our quiet pool. OVERALL: We are planning on returning this February to Port Orleans-Riverside. I'm not interested in trying another moderate resort because in my opinion they don't have more to offer. Riverside has more food options with one sit down restaurant and two food courts, two main pools and 5 quiet pools, on time transportation, a free ferry to downtown Disney, breathtaking views, and a relaxing environment much needed after a long day the the parks. I am interested in trying other Deluxe Resorts, but I don't think they are worth it for the money (an extra $1000) even during value season.

The wait was about 10 minutes. Surprisngly the room was ready and we were able to get our room early. Anticipating problems from reviews I read on this site, I was pleasantly surprised by how clean the room was. Yes they need to be updated and yes there is a very very slight musty odor in the room (bring or request an air freshner, we did) but the cleaning staff surely did a great job with what they had to work with. Outdated doesn't mean not clean. Extra towels were provided which never was a problem for the length of our stay. We had our beds made and the room cleaned every day. As far as some comments posted here about not getting their rooms cleaned or vacumed , all you have to do is pick up the phone and push 1 button for housekeeping and they will be more than happy to oblige. TIP: Hunt down your housekeeper and meet her. Tell her your needs & concerns and you will be surprised at the service you will receive (a couple of extra bucks wouldn't hurt either). We stayed in the Magnolia Terrace (Bldg #85, 1st floor). Try to get the second floor, we had to deal with the sound of the toilette draining when it was flushed. Very close to the main pool and the lobby. The pool is nice and very warm. Average temperature was 65 degrees during the day. Although the East Depot is closer, use the South Depot because that's the 1st stop it hits when it enters the Riverside complex. If the hotel is crowded you will understand why. I agree with the person who posted the comment about the staff not being too thrilled to be there but I only encountered that at the River Roost, they are interns from colleges around the country. I will say they were very friendly when engaged in conversation. I would probably chalk that up to their supervisory staff. Be sure to get all the park maps ahead of time and plan. Also if you have the dining plan be sure to understand it and figure out what eateries accept it. Overall it's a nice place to stay. Are there better, of course but for the price it was well worth it. If you are like us you are not going to be spending much time in the room anyway. If you feel you need to be waited on hand and foot don't bother, it's not that kind of place. That's probably why there were so many nice people at this resort. TIP: If you encounter a long wait for your bus return ride from the's parks take a cab. It should cost you about $10 and if it's late and your kids are exhausted it's worth it.

Our family trip consisted of Myself and My wife, my 65 year old Mom and my 11 year old twins and 8 year old son. We arrived around mid-morning and check in was easy, although the check in attendant was not the most welcoming person in the resort and were assigned 2 adjacent rooms in section 37. Not being at the resort before, we were provided a map and although it did not look like a far walk, it felt like a lifetime to get from the lobby (and restaurant area) to our place. We got to the room and asked to be relocated since my Mom was not able to walk that far to get to the lobby and there is no means of transportation thoughout the resort for the elderly or people that have trouble walking for a long period. The second check in attendant was a bit nicer (not much though) and relocated us to an area we thought was closer to the lobby and restaurants (Lodge 17) and although it was shorter, it was still over a mile walk. that is not an exageration either! Once checked in, we headed to board the bus on the South depot to head to Epcot and looked forward to a start of a great vacation. Not a long wait (about 15 minutes) but a packed bus since the buses pick up passengers for the Riverside resort (4 depots) and then go to the French Quarter resort too. If you are last to be picked up and have a large party, it could be an uncomfortable ride. After our rained out visit at Epcot, we returned to the resort to grab dinner on our meal plan. The huge cafeteria is ALWAYS packed between normal rush hours and very difficult to get a seat for 6 of us. The food in the main dining area was mediocure at best. Nice selection, but not very good. If you are a buffet lover then you will not find this place to be all that bad, but we are not buffet style eaters and were not at all impressed with the food there. The best meal was breakfast because the kids loved eating the Mickey Mouse shaped waffles. My wife and i did not eat there after our fist day. The other restaurant on site at the resort (Boat Rites) was fair to moderate also. OK menu, but it appeared to be the same kitchen staff that works at the cafeteria style restaurant. Good deserts here, but not a very good meal overall. As far as the rooms go. I agree with most of the other reviews. The rooms are a bit outdated and need to be renovated. the bathroom and shower areas were clean, but the hoousekeeping services were not very good. Although they did make our beds daily (not sure they changed the sheets each day), it appears they do not vacuum or remove any finished glasses or plates left in the room. My wife and I had our drink glasses from the bar on the first night there in the room with us when we checked out on Saturday! You would think they would take the empty glasses after the 2nd day they were left there. We decided to see how long it would be until they removed them and sure enough, they were still there when we checked out. If you are planning on visiting this resort, please be prepared to walk. Since there is no transportation between buildings, your venture to the lobby area could be a long one depending on where your lodge is located. Also, i recommend renting a car. Although buses are convenient, you are at the mercy of waiting constantly and then risking them being very crowded. The Riverside and French Quarter resorts are VERY crowded places, so there are many people trying to do the same as you and get on the fastest bus to get to your final location. With a rental car, it may cost a little more money, but you have some more freedom and it is worth it it in long run. Lastly, although I was on vaction, I was trying to stay plugged into the happenings at the office but the resort charges $9.95 per day for internet service and it is very shotty to say the least. On several occasions, I had to re-pay because the internet service would stop working during the 24 hour period. The front desk staff said that has happened before and they did reinburse me for the double charges but it was still not something I can say worked well. For all the money we are spending, the least they could do is offer free wired internet service (since there is no wireless access ANYWHERE). Based on our experience, we would not stay at this resort again strictly because of how crowded it is. We visited in an \"off peak\" time and it was crowded then, i could not imagine how it would be if we were there during a peak period.", "Date": "November 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Konawa", "Title": "\u201cLoved the hotel, everything you could want.\u201d", "Author": "busymama03", "ReviewID": "UR86412693", "Content": "The rooms were nice and clean, a step up in every way from the disney value hotels.

Our first visit in 2008 was in the Alligator bayou section building 39. This visit we were in Magnolia Terrace building 85 which is on the water and very nice. I much prefer the Mansion section. While the rustic outdoor look of the bayou is unique I enjoy the decor and style of the Mansions. Upon entering our room there was a card saying that the carpets had just been cleaned and may still be damp and I was pleased to know they were freshly cleaned. While our room was kept \"clean\", the housekeeping is mediocre at best. We never received any towel buddies despite leaving tips and our family who was also staying at the Resort in building 27 in the bayou received as many as 5 in one day. Not a big deal but my kids looked forward to getting towel buddies and were disappointed daily after returning from the parks. We also saw a handful of small lego parts from the previous guests on the bathroom floor behind the toilet. Yuck! My daughter spilled a small amount of powder on the floor in between the beds on about day 5 of our trip and it remained there until we checked out. I guess housekeeping didn't vacuum the last half of our stay. My Mom had a bag of personal items on the bathroom counter and one day she noticed things moved around and the bag unzipped not like she had left it so we wondered if housekeeping looked around in it. Nothing was taken so no harm done. Bus service is nice and all but if we used the depot closest to our room we would definately have been standing the majority of the time so we walked to the main stop at the front of the main building to catch the bus before it stopped at the rest of the depot's. One day we waiting an hour to get a bus to the Magic Kingdom and watched while at least 2 buses came and went for Epcot and Animal Kingdom. After that day Disney had a cast member there daily to coordinate buses which was really nice to see and it helped alot. Bottom line is I really love this Resort and the problems we encountered were minimal in comparison to all the wonderful things this Resort has to offer. My kids loved the pools and I enjoyed the atmosphere, the music and meeting people from all over the Country. The food court was good and Boatright's was OK- not very good service the night we were there. Server was very busy. I will definately stay here again when we get the chance to go back.

There was a sign on the room door that asked guests to go green and turn off lights and turn up the A/C when leaving the room for the day, but one day when I returned to the room housekeeping had left on every single light (literally) in the room and turned the A/C down as low as it would go. They also left the curtains open so everyone passing by could see into the room. One of the A/C units for the vending machine area was malfunctioning and made loud noise constantly. There is no fitness center. There was mold over most of the tiles in the shower. It was so thick in places there was no way housekeeping could have missed it. It must have been months since the shower was last cleaned well. You get free bus service to the Disney parks, but in exchange you give up many of the amenities that you get in other, even cheaper hotels. The exterior of the hotel is immaculate.

Close the curtains and you could have been in any low end hotel in the world. - Room was relatively clean, but housekeeping only ever made the beds. No evidence of any other cleaning done during our 3 day stay ( even found items belonging to previous guests just under the bed ). - No travel cot even though we had requested it prior to our arrival. - Bell staff (other than one or two) gave the impression their job was to stand about and do nothing all day. You felt that you were encroaching on their time by asking for help. The good points (there were some).. - Nice environment. A walk along the riverside to get to the main building was nice. - Plenty pools. - Bus Service to other Disney parks and Downtown disney was good. ( although we did have one driver give us some incorrect information which cost us some valuable time on our last day). Also, bus service isn't really related to the hotel. Would we stay here again ? - Not likely. It wasn't the worst hotel we've stayed in, but it certainly wasn't the best. Value for money wasn't really that great and the hotel staff didn't really seem to know anything about anything which wasn't in their hotel.

Upon arrival everything was perfect as far as check in, getting the room, and the grounds were still beautiful. When we finally did get our room it was filthy. The border around the ceiling was peeling off as well as there having mold or mildew spots above the border the entire length around the ceiling. The in room fridge was frozen solid with a huge yellow stain on the ice inside, as well as hair inside on all four sides of it. Soda or juice was spilled from a prior occupant in the air conditioner. Food was on the floor in the corners of the room with ants feeding off of it, as well as more hair in both sinks and the bath tub. I called the front desk and requested another room, thinking that would fix the problem. Another room was given in the same building, but had more of the same problems. Fridge was ok, still had mold or mildew around the ceiling border and the border itself was coming off the walls. Hair in both sinks again as well as the tub. The ceiling fan which we would rather use instead of the airconditioner had atleast an inch of dust caked on the entire thing. We decided to stay in the room and cleaned what we could (which we shouldn't do since we payed for this). I left a note for the housekeeper to clean the ceiling fan and they did which was fine. We only had one towel made animal on the bed once throughout the entire trip, and even that was chessy. They just glued fake eyes and put stickers all over it.

The layout and beauty of this Resort is simply stunning. Yes it's big - but that's the point. It is like staying in a small town with winding paths, rivers, trees, gardens etc. It manages to feel cosy and intimate as the buildings are set amongst the trees and each area has it's own pool (Six pools inc. Old Man Island - good fun to try them all and find your favourite). This was our fourth visit - first time without children and to be honest we came back more for POR than to visit the Parks. We have always stayed in Alligator Bayou before - which was fine -(although I think the Hickory bed frames are a theme too far) so requested a room in Magnolia Terrace this time. Lovely location, Oak Manor 2nd floor corner room overlooking river. The rooms are similar but furnishings seemed more luxurious and grown up. Beds were very comfy too. A few things we've learnt that may be useful: Buses - Coming back from Magic Kingdom after fireworks bus queue to Riverside was huge! Would have taken at least an hour in line to get on bus - checked out queue to French Quarter and hardly any wait so we took that bus. Driver was kind enough to drop us (and quite a few others - we all cheered and clapped him) off at Riverside but you can either catch the boat up to POR which goes every 10 minuites between 4p.m. and 11 p.m. or walk along the River path - not as long as we expected - takes about 10 minuites stroll to main building. Meal Plan - We had the free meal plan and often used snack option for breakfast e.g. Bagel or Cinnamon Roll and had with a coffee in our room as we got ready for the day. We found the best place to eat counter service was Wolfgang Puck Express at Downtown Disney - thoroughly recommend it - good quality well prepared food. We did have the full service option but quite frankly we wouldn't bother again - lots of restuarants were disappointing - even Californian Grill and Brown Derby the food and service left much to be desired. I think if we went again we would pop into themed restaurants out of peak time and just have a starter or dessert and enjoy the atmosphere. Boardwalk - If you are spending a day at Epcot and the crowds all get too much - take a break - catch the boat at the International Gateway between England and France and hop over to The Boardwalk for a stroll along the Prom and a cool glass of something outside Big River Grill and watch the world go by.

When the resorts were combined they picked up FQ first, then Riverside, which would have been fine had they reversed the hotel stops, but they then attempted to drop off FQ patrons who were seated, before the Riverside who were standing blocking the way out. More than once the bus had to nearly unload and reload for the FQ stops. All that said, the hotel staff was great. Delivered packages that we had ordered right to our door.

We arrived at about 11:45 a.m. and were thrilled that our room was ready for us, even though we were earlier than the 3 p.m. check-in. We were originally assigned to the Alligator Bayou rooms. However, upon opening the door and seeing the rustic furnishings, I immediately called the front desk to request a room in Magnolia Bend. I didn't want to feel as though I was roughing it for a week and we were again pleasantly surprised to find Disney to be very accommodating. They quickly rerouted us to Magnolia Bend, with a room ready for us. We loved having an in-room refrigerator and the pool and laundry were very close. The walk to the main pool and dining hall was lovely and relaxing. In the mornings the dining hall is very crowded with limited seating, even until about 11 a.m. We ate on the patio one morning and realized later that they open Boatwright's for extra breakfast seating. Boatwright's doesn't serve at that time; they simply allow you to bring your food from the other restaurant. We suggest sharing meals as some of the portions can be large. Disney frowns on sharing meals, especially if you're on the DDP, but it really helps to stretch those credits. Sharing a Quick Service meal is possible--but they won't let you share a Table Service meal. And remember that if you're fortunate enough to get the free dining plan, tips are generally not included and the 18-20% suggestion can be costly, so make sure you figure that into your budget. Dining at Cinderella's Castle will cost you two credits per person and the tip is included, along with a souvenir photo. We only waited an extended amount of time for one shuttle to Magic Kingdom and when the crowd grew restless, three shuttles showed up. We stayed near the North Depot and it was never crowded. Expect to stand on the buses, though, on weekend stays as this is quite a large resort. The main pool temperature was frigid, even on hot days due to the water slide and fountains.

The family friendly \"bar\" near the lobby is a nice place to relax and mingle with fellow guests. My son and husband espeically loved watching the last world soccer match with other fans.

I highly recommend downloading a few Disney World apps on your phone to maximize your experience. One of the best apps gave us instructions on the fastest way to get to and from our destination.

This hotel was ideal and they had plenty of 'them time' with us knowing they were in a safe environment! We were situated in the Magnolia building which was a 2 minute stroll to the pool next to our accommodation and 3 minutes from the main 'feature' pool. The boys spent time at both pools but, to be honest, the pool nearest our block was more than ample and had its own laundry room situated poolside so parents could use this whilst the kids are in the pool if need be. We were approx. a 4 min stroll from the main reception/restaurant/food court bar, etc. We (unknowingly) were on the Disney Dining plan which was fantasic (if you haven't already arranged this, find out more and book it!) and the food and snacks were really good, freshly cooked and massive in portion. If not on the dining plan, food was fairly reasonably priced but obviously that's dependent on your own budget. Only downside is paper plates and plastic cutlery but unless you book a 'service' restaurant off-site, much of the hotel food courts are the same. The refillable mug that you can purchase for, I think, something like $20 is also worth it if you have youngsters but depending on what Disney Dining Plan you get, this is included. The foodcourt in the hotel consisted of five or six different stations: Breakfast ranged from 'All American' to pancakes, freshly cooked omlette with your choice of filling, croissant, fruit, muffins, cereal, etc. with dinner from a meal of meat, potatoes veg. to freshly cooked pasta/noodles with your choice of add-ins to your usual burger and fries! The hotel has a fantastic, extra large arcade where a 'top up card' was used to play (parents can top up so children aren't carrying cash), play park (our boys were too old!) fishing hole where you can hire rods (small fee), bike and speed boat rentals (small fee) and horse & carriage ride (small fee). We took a bike for 4 towards the end of our holiday just to have a ride round the grounds (approx. 1.2 miles) and didn't realise how huge and well kept the hotel was!

Our ONLY real complaint with this hotel was a few bugs in the room......first couple were roaches......but we were in the room so little it didn't make that much of a difference. If I return to Disney I'll probably try another resort just for some variety BUT I would definitly stay at P.O. Riverside again. Excellent VERYFRIENDLY service all over resort and Disney.

We really enjoyed our stay at Port Orleans and we absolutely chose the best time to go to Disney! The Magic Kingdom was decorated for Halloween and the most we ever waited on a ride was 15 minutes! The rooms at Port Orleans were clean, the pools and grounds were clean and it was very peaceful! We stayed in cottage #16 which is close to one of the quiet pools and laundry. This resort is spread out and there is a walk to the lobby/restaurant area however....while there, we visited the Polynesian, The Boardwalk, The Yacht Club, Animal Kingdom Lodge and Wilderness Lodge and they are all large resorts as well. The Port Orleans has several cottages that are only two levels, so that is why it seems like a long walk, but if you stay in the other resorts there would still be a long walk to the lobby area because they are resorts... HUGE! They accommodate a lot of people! I would compare the Port Orleans to accommodations in Pigeon Forge and Gatllinburg, TN. The walkways are winding and beautiful. There are small bridges that are over small ponds of water throughout the grounds so we saw lots of lizards, frogs, squirrels and bunnies! The river is alongside the jogging/walking path where ducks, geese and other birds hang out and you can take a boat ride to the French Quarter section of Port Orleans and to Downtown Disney. Everyone at the resort was friendly and helpful....you will never be confused or lost if you just ask for help. The Concierge was so helpful with dining reservations. They are located in the lobby area and they will assist you with dining, attractions, printing maps, etc. The General Store in the lobby area was wonderful and that's where I did all of my shopping! This resort has four bus stops: North, South, East and West. The buses were really good about rotating which depot to pick up and let off first. A little tip: If your room isn't close to the lobby, you can drive over from your cottage and park at the lobby area near the first depot. That way, if you wanted to get dinner at the end of the day, you could go into the cafeteria through the lobby and drive your tired kids to your room at night instead of \"dragging\" them like so many people were doing:) Our kids loved the 'Ol Man Island with a water slide and there's a bar at the pool...they make the best margaritas! For dining, we ate breakfast in the cafeteria most mornings, except on morning we at at Boma's in the Animal Kingdom Lodge...LOVED IT! They make American breakfast foods and African-inspired items plus they make their own orange, guava and passion fruit juice they serve...yummy! Inside the Port Orleans is Boatwright's restaurant....we ate there one evening and highly recommend it. For your dinners, I do recommend you make reservations! We ate at the Flying Fish Cafe inside the Boardwalk Resort...excellent fine dinning; the Yachtsman Steakhouse inside the Yacht Club Resort...hand-cut steaks, excellent; The Hoop-De-Do Musical Review dinner show at the Wilderness Campground...The BEST! Funny and entertaining! They served the best home-style food and my kids LOVED IT; we also went to the Polynesian Resort for their Luau....great show complete with fire eating and yummy Hawaiian-style food! We did the dining plan and I do recommend it! It's so much easier to have everything on on a card, your \"key to the world\" that is your park pass, your room key, use it to lift the security gate to get into the resort, use it as your credit card and your dining payment. I really wanted to stay at the Polynesian originally but after staying at Port Orleans and visiting the other resorts, I have to say that I don't think the Polynesian would have been worth the extra money. Keep in mind that you don't spend much time in your room and the most important thing for me is the beds...I have back issues and these beds did not bother me at all! They have very nice mattresses and I slept like a baby! If I had any complaints, it would only be that the channel choices on the TV were sparse and mostly Disney-oriented and they charged $10 for 24 hours of Internet usage...I really think that should be included for free. Other than that, I really don't have anything bad to say about this resort and the atmosphere really is comforting.", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wirral", "Title": "\u201cgreat stay at riverside\u201d", "Author": "boothy16", "ReviewID": "UR80154687", "Content": "We have just returned from our 2 week stay at disney port orleans riverside resort and was definatley a great choice.

We stayed in magnolia bend section, this was a great location, we were close to everything. The boat to downtown disney was a lovely way of travelling, we used this many times, as it was very relaxing. The bus service from this hotel to the parks was also very good, did find the air con on the buses a bit cold though. We were on the disney dinning plan, fantastic would recommend to everyone, could'nt manage to eat all the meals 10 left over by the time we left, As the kids were'nt to fussed on waffle omelette and pancake breakfasts that were offered every morning in the hotel, We tended to use a snack for breakfast, bagel. coissant and coffee, and then had 1quick dinning plan meal out in the parks, and then our second meal in downtown disney in the evening, would recommend Wolfgang puck and The earl of sandwich, The dinning plan meals consist of meal, dessert and drinks, my daughter and i frequently shared a meal as we would never have eaten a whole meal to ourselves, . The room was spacious, and very clean, our mousemaid left us towel animals, very clever how they are made. One of the reasons we had booked disney hotel, is so that my husband and son could play golf and have the free golf hire for all the disney courses, this is offered in most of the uk holiday brochures, unfortunately disney reception staff had never heard of this, as we had not taken our brochure on hols with us we had no proof of this, we eventually convinced the receptionist to look up on the uk disney web page to confirm this with us, we did eventually have the free golf hire, as it was in black and white on the page when she looked it up, so if you are planning on playing golf take along proof of the free hire. Reception staff are also not very helpful in directing you off the disney area, we asked how to get to universal, not much help nobody seemed to know, unyet when we asked the bus drivers they were a great help. If you need directions its best to ask the bus drivers they are way more helpful than reception, If you go to down town disney . get off bus at marketplace, cross the main road and there is a local bus service, the 111 takes you to the florida mall shopping centre, we used this bus stop to get to universal, cost us 6 dollars for the whole family, rather than the 40 dollar taxi ride.

The trees are a great escape from the Sun and the heat, we saw many lizards, different types of birds and rabbits on the property. The room was perfect for what it was a place to sleep, shower and change and NOTHING MORE. Very small, the bathroom was outdated and dingy. The maid cleaned daily and left us towel art on the bed and in the sink area holding our toothbrush. My kids needed a rest throughout the day from the parks so we would head towards our room and the TV channel choice's were not the best, being a Disney Property I was hoping for at least a channel that showed Disney movies non stop but no only one or two Disney Channels that the majority of the time showed more preteen friendly programs (zach the suite life?, etc) Reading the reviews on this site prior to our stay and looking at a map of the property I called a few days ahead and requested building 14 Alligator Bayou and what a great LOCATION Close to all!!!! Our room was steps away from the main building which is close to the bridge towards the pool and close to the parking lot. Our room location was PERFECT because walking all day in the parks the last thing you want to do is WALK to your room or WALK to get a drink, WALK to the pool etc. I didnt expect much but years ago I stood at the Caribbean Beach Resort and from what I can remember I prefer that Hotel to this one I dont know why I just do. I did not like the food options at the Hotel at all if we didnt have the Dining Plan I would have eaten out all the time (for a few days we drove about 5min out of Disney and ate at a McDonalds, Chilis, Olive Garden etc.) If you rented a car there are many options ride outside Disney World ;) We did some Character Meals and My fav are The Chip n Dale at Epcot and the Winny the Pooh in Magic Kingdom, we went for breakfast and are allowed into the parks before anyone and get to the rides early my kids were able to get on Splash Mountain, and the Railroad roller coaster twice with no lines at all. We took the boat to Downtown Disney and it was beautiful we never waited for the boat long and always got a seat. The staff at the resort seemed fine some were \"Disney Happy\". The pool was a great escape the boys LOVED the slide. There was always a chair and always a shaded area. All in all the Hotel was a perfect location for leaving the parks and enjoying a swim.

Did not get into the room until about 11:00 PM. I had requested a room close to the main building and near transportation. I was assigned to building 15 of the Alligator Bayou section. I guess this was pretty much as close as you could get but at Disney World nothing is that close. The room was decorated in sort of log cabin style and felt it was dark and dingy looking. The only things that were white were the two sinks which both appeared to be very dirty including toothpaste residue from previous guests and black grime around the faucets. The furniture appeared dusty but it was kind of hard to tell because it was so rustic in style. It also appeared as though the corners were never vacuumed. I could only assume that the rest of the room was just as dirty as the sinks but it was hard to tell because it was the kind of color scheme that camoflauges dirt. I called to complain and a woman did come with cleaning supplies but my kids were already in bed at this time so I opted to clean the sinks and tub myself. I spent almost no time in the room other than sleeping and showering. The bed was comfortable enough. The linens looked worn and kind of shabby and I would have preferred a cleaner and brighter decor. It also had an old type of TV, not that I used it too much but even the Hampton Inns have flat screens. The other section of the hotel that looked like mansions appeared more attractive to me but the buildings seemed to be farther away from the main facilities. The lobby and expansive gift store were very nice. The food court was OK. I did not use the table service restaurant but it looked justed OK. The pool area was nice enough. I did feel the price was good, especially being that at this time of year a free meal plan was offered and we took advantage of this. If I came here for a resort experience I would have been disappointed but we were here only to sleep and we had a great time at the parks so it was OK.

First, let's make sure we are all on the same page: Port Orleans is a Disney owned and operated resort. That means you'll likely a) pay a premium and b) endure some waiting in lines and/or for services. If you're planning a trip to Disney World and expect anything other than the above, you should perhaps reconsider and travel elsewhere. At any Disney resort, you're paying for the convenience of staying on the property and all of the perks that come with it. Riverside is no exception but here we found the prices to be reasonable (breaking down our Disney package, we estimated our stay to cost approximately $180 per night for three people in a room with two double beds) given the number of amenities offered on site. The property itself is lovely with tree-lined walk-ways, attractive buildings and a small river running through the complex. Regular boat service is offered from the hotel to Downtown Disney and we found we had no difficulty getting a seat on a boat with very little wait. Transportation to and from the parks is provided and while it's been knocked pretty badly on this site, our experience suggests Disney is actually doing quite a good job managing that process. We never waited more than ten to fifteen minutes for a bus (Disney promises 20 minutes or less) and often were able to walk up and get on a waiting bus within only a few minutes. Once on board, the ride is always quick and painless. (As well as being much more eco-friendly, riding the bus also saves you from the daily parking charge you would be subjected to at the parks if you opt to stay off property.) Even in the mad rush to leave Epcot following the fireworks, there was no difficulty getting a bus quickly back to Riverside. We used the Disney package delivery service (transporting purchases from the park to your Disney hotel) during our stay and found that the employees at Riverside did a great job. There was never a wait to obtain our packages at the store and the long hours of availability (opening early morning and closing at 11:00 PM) meant we never had a problem getting back to the hotel in time to obtain our purchases. Room quality is perhaps not what one would otherwise expect from a $150 to $200 per night room. However, our room was clean, well-lit, and easy to access from the lobby/restaurant area. We selected the Magnolia Bend area and found we had more than enough space in our room for all our extra purchases and luggage. The staff was friendly and helpful (they can do anything from making dining reservations - necessary in the World now with the new dining plans - to printing boarding passes and offering directions). Our \"mousekeeper\" Elizabeth even left us creative towel animals each day in our room. We had a problem with our air conditioner on the third morning of our stay and found that it was repaired almost instantly once I called to report the issue. Our repair guys even apologized to us, multiple times, for the problem and couldn't have been more polite. It's true, the furniture could use some replacing and I agree that a rennovation is about due. That said, I was in no way disappointed in my stay and would happily select Riverside again in the future. It's showing a bit of it's age and is not as fancy as some of the higher end resorts but it is functional, convenient and the exteriors make up for what the rooms themselves lack. If you cannot afford the premium price attached to the higher end resorts, please consider Riverside. It's a great balance between value and luxury vacation.", "Date": "September 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cLove this resort\u201d", "Author": "cheerdad2009", "ReviewID": "UR78691900", "Content": "This is my families 2nd trip to Port Orleans-Riverside and for the 2nd time it did not disappoint.....My wife and I love this resort because of the atmosphere, the pool and the fun that can be had by all ages.

First - transportation from the airport. Our bus was not the nice Disney Magic Express bus - it was a leaky and run down Mears yellow bus. There were TV's but no shows playing. Water was literally pouring down on the seat beside me from rain on the outside. The bus was smelly and musty. Yuck. The first time we stayed at Port Orleans our luggage was wisked away by a porter and we were carried to our rooms on a golf cart. That was classy. This time we had to hunt down the porter to park our bags, and you get a map showing you the mile walk to your hotel. Not exactly the service we expected. When we got to our hotel room later in the day - our room was hot. The maintenance person was quick and friendly. The fix to the AC unit was a simple knob replacement and someone had duct taped the old knob to fix it. Our room had a great view of the parking lot and the busy road, but you could not hear it as long as you kept the AC going. The room came with a trundle and a fridge which I was happy about. I expected the trundle but not the fridge. Everything was clean except for the tub in the bathroom. I have a pet peeve about clean bathrooms. The tile in the tub had mold in the grout and I could rub it off with my finger. That told me that no one had bothered to scrub this tub in a while. Also the tub itself was just plain dirty and looked like it had not been scrubbed. Yuck again and not what I expect from Disney. You would think that once a week they could scrub the tub. The dining hall was actually better this time around. The first two times we stayed I didn't really like it at all. I was a bit more choosy with my food this time and I hit on a few winners. The carved beef was terrific and all of the deserts were great. But the cleanliness again was only average. Over all I was underwhelmed with my stay at Disney. The cleanliness and service were not what I've experienced in the past and needs updating. No internet. Old CRT TV's. I don't know if they are short staffed or what, but the attention to detail just wasn't there and all of the workers seemed stressed out to me. Dirty shower, worn furniture and AC unit, no VIP treatment upon arrival, yucky magic express. When we were leaving at the end of our week, the bus driver was slinging luggage into the bus like he was in a race. It was too many little things to ignore. The disney parks as well just weren't magical like I remember. The \"cast members\" acted frazzled and on edge. Several times while we were there rides broke down or were delayed. The magic hours were a joke - you waited longer for a ride during Magic Hours than you did during regular hours. I felt like I was a part of a big machine and they were just crunching us through to the next gift shop. I had a horrible experience getting my food in Epcot at the Morrocco counter service restaurant. They took my order then literally served everyone else and forgot completely about me. When I tried to tell the server she said \"I'm just giving out the food they give me\" - so I had to yell at the \"cook\" and order him to make my food. The big kicker was waiting almost two hours for Fanstamic only to have it cancelled due to \"weather\" when there wasn't even a cloud in the sky. I suppose a vacation is what you make of it but Disney standards have fallen since we stayed last. If they expect people to stay in their resorts and pay movie theatre prices for everything (3 bucks for water, 5 bucks for popcorn, 25 bucks for a decent meal) - then they need to step it up on the service side of the house.

Cleanliness you would expect from Disney, however the foodcourt let that side down. Food okay but the cleaners need to clean more often and more efficiently.

The room is basic,clean & comfortable.You don't spend much time in it so I don't know why people moan about the size!! You sleep in it,grab your gear & go to parks.We didn't travel 5000 miles to sit in a room. The food court has great for me as I don't eat meat(I've struggled in other Disney hotels to find anything other than a pizza or veggie burger)There was salades & pastas to design for your own taste,plus chicken/beef 'Sunday' dinners,burgers, pizzas etc.I'd try to get there early for breakfast as it can get packed at this time.We had the Disney dining plan which was great as food can get rather expensive after eating at Disney for two weeks.

We arrived earlier that planned so our room was not ready upon arrival. We left our cell phone number with the desk and were sent a text message once our room was ready. How many hotels do that?? Our room was spacious enough for 2 adults and 2 kids. The amenities included a ceiling fan, mini fridge, a small table with two chairs, hair dryer and iron with ironing board. Although the furniture did look a little worn, cleanliness was not an issue. (and I'm a self proclaimed \"germ-a-phobe\") We tipped our Mousekeeper daily and were greeted with cute towel creations 3 of the 5 nights. The grounds are absolutely beautiful! Disney does take pride in its appearance, that's for sure. The grounds are spread out but the scenery distracts from some of the distance that you have to cover. Ducks and rabbits were a daily sighting. The pool was large and has a fun slide that I could not get the kids off of! The lifeguards were very attentive and friendly. One even made gave my daughter a set of beads to wear. Every Princess LOVES getting jewelry! The food court has a great selection, although it gets crowded at peak times. A friendly recommendation - buy the refillable drink mugs. Always having unlimited access to cold soda, iced tea, hot chocolate and coffee was very convenient. The only form of Disney transportation that I can comment on was the boat from the resort to Downtown Disney. You may have to wait in line to board but it was a nice, relaxing cruise that we all enjoyed. MUST HAVES for visiting the theme parks: snacks, bottled water, drink mix, ponchos and or/umbrellas, misting fans, lots of sunscreen and the greatest thing ever invented...FAST PASS! We must have saved HOURS of time waiting in line by utilizing this system. We felt guilty everytime we'd get in the Fast Pass return line and walk by dozens upon dozens of non-Fast Pass, sweaty, cranky park goers.

In addition, the bed were high enough to be able to slide the empty suitcases underneath. This gave a lot of extra floor space. We never had any issues with housekeeping or maintainence. Our building did not have elevators. This was not an issue for us, just ask for a ground floor room or the Magnolia section if needed. The selection at the food court was ample with a salad station, pasta station, burger station, sandwich station, home cooking area, and a bakery. The main lobby building had a piano bar, concierge, food court, general store, and arcade. On our last day the kiosk at the arcade broke down. Disney then switched all the video games to free. More than a fair trade for the inconvenience. The boat ride to the French Quarter and Downtown Disney was handy. After 4:00 pm the boats ran every 10 minutes, but they do fill up quickly.

I was sad to leave. We had a wonderful time here. This resort was beautiful and very relaxing after a long day at the Disney parks. We've stayed in all the Value Resorts as well as the Caribbean and hands down this is our favorite. I've also stayed at the Grand Floridian, but this of course is not a moderate hotel so can't compare apples to oranges. If you are looking to stay in a moderate resort this is the one to stay at. I read previous posts where people mention having to walk to far and complaining the resort was huge. Yes, the resort is big and there is much land but this is what makes it beautiful to me. If you are not in the greatest of shape or don't like to walk much, then I advise you to stay elsewhere. We were fortunate to get a room in Magnolia Bend so a bus stop was right outside our building and the lobby was right over the bridge. I personally didn't think any of the rooms/building were that far from the bus stops or lobby but I am also a runner, so I probably have a different viewpoint than some. Because the grounds are a bit more spacious than other Disney resorts, it gives you space meaning you aren't on top of a gazillion other families and kids running around. Not once in our 7 days did we feel over crowded anywhere on the resort. We registered without a problem. We had to wait maybe 5 minutes at most to check-in. We took the boat to Downtown Disney and that was a nice ride. Again, very relaxing after a long day at the parks. The room was clean, our housekeeper was great - always arranging my daughters stuffed animals and dolls on the beds. She made some really cute animals/characters out of towels as well. We used the pool next to our room instead of the main kids pool. This was great as well. A nice size pool with hardly anyone there. There are a few pools on this property which makes it nice. We loved the Cafeteria too - it never felt too crowded. We loved the brownie and Carrot Cake. We mainly ate outside of the resort but we did end up eating one meal at the resort and we enjoyed it - it's the basic disney fare. My sister and I asked the main desk for a running path around the property and they told us where to run - the path ended up being the main path around the resort - we took it into the french quarter and so we ended up with a nice 1 mile loop. We ran this a few times - it was so nice to have the 'river' on one side, and the trees on the other side of you. One note to parents is that this hotel isn't as 'disney commercialized' as the value resorts. the rooms are not decorated with disney characters, mickey, etc, like the value resorts. The one and only negative I have about this resort is that you had to pay $10 a day for internet in your room.

If you are looking for some tanning time in the Florida sun, visit one of the other non-themed pools or the waterparks. The other common areas were nice as well. The main dining room was always slammed in the mornings. Either time you trip there for early, early in the morning or wait till after 10:00. Also, the layout tends to lead to guest confusion. People going every which way without any kind of obvious flow. Also, we did not experience any issues with Disney transportation (as I've read in other reviews). The depot closest to our room was convenient, and we never had any issues catching a bus at the main depot. Overall, this was a good place to stay.

My family of four ages are 39, 37, 13, and 9. We stayed in the Port Orleans Riverside for six nights, from July 15 - July 21st. In this review I will break down several parts of the entire experience. Please read as much or as little as you feel necessary. MAGICAL EXPRESS/CHECK IN: At the Orlando International Airport, we found the Disney Transportation to be as efficient as it can be. I had my Magical Express boarding documents in hand which saved me time. We waited for no more than 15 minutes, boarded our bus with people staying in the French Quarter and Old Key West resorts. The Riverside was the first stop. In less than 30 minutes we arrived at the Riverside. I did on line check in the day before our arrival. Upon entering the lobby, there were two active windows for those who checked in on line and 5 for those who had not. I was \"next\" and the young man was courteous and pleasant during check in. I really don't feel checking in on line lessened my time. OUR BUILDING/ROOM We were in \"Magnolia Terrance,\" building 85. I made three requests during my initial reservation, two of which were granted. I wanted this building as one of my three choices, and ground floor. We were very satisfied with our room and the grounds. I timed a casual walk from room 8562 to the lobby and it took 4:35. It took 2:20 to get to the main pool. In 2007 we stayed in the French Quarter, which is the sister resort to the Riverside. The rooms are identical and take advantage of every 340 square feet. My wife and I slept very comfortably in the double beds. For your reference, I am a 180 pounds and my wife is 115 lbs. The two sinks and curtain separating the room from the sinks allowed for enough privacy. THE GROUNDS: This resort's grounds are truly beautiful. If I were a bird, squirrel, rabbit, or snack I would want to live at the Riverside. We saw all four of these when walking around. One snake that my kids anxiously appreciated, and we never saw again. MOUSEKEEPING: We tipped on two separate days. My daughter decorated some envelopes to leave money in. One one day my wife said commented the decaf coffee wasn't replenished. On another day our used wash clothes were left; and during our six night stay, we never had an animal made from towels. DISNEY TRANSPORTATION: My family and I had some really good luck with the bus system. I only remember having to wait for buses going to EPCOT, and those weights exceeded the \"every 20 minutes\" by 20 more minutes. EXTRA HOURS IN MORNINGS/EVENING: Going to the parks when they first open is the best way to maximize your experience. On three days we were at the park with magical morning hours. We fast passed and waited in modest lines to ride the kids favorites. We did all we wanted in those parks and were walking out by noon. Expect 60-90 minute waits during peak hours for Toy Story mania, Space Mountain, Expedition Everest, Soarin', etc. On one of the nights Magic Kingdom stayed open till 3 AM. We had one of our table service dinners at Magic Kingdom that night and had planned on taking advantage of the late night, on property privilege. Magic Kingdom\u2019s regular hours were till midnight. The crowds at this park were the worse I have ever seen!! Stay away. There were so many electric carts, baby strollers and people it was the most miserable experience of our days. DINNING PLAN: This was our fifth time to take advantage of the dinning plan and it is really a good deal. Do some research and plan to eat in some of Disney's wonderfully themed restaurants. It will be hard green vegetables unless your eating a table service meal. This trip I learned how to get more from my snacks. In years past we were utilizing a whole snack for pint size milk. At the end of our 2009 trip I found 1/2 gallon milk jugs being sold in the resort stores. I paid 2.99 for a 1/2 gallon that lasted as long as we were there. Plus, when flying Southwest, I spread a case of water into four different suitcases. That, too, saved some snacks and cash. We packed cereals, granola bars and pop tarts and were glad we did. OVERALL: This was my families best Disney Experience. Since we had been before we weren\u2019t on a quest to do all we could each day. On our early days in the parks we took three naps in the afternoon and felt like new people for the evenings. We initially chose the Riverside for a simple change from the French Quarter, but feel it offers more. The Riverside has six pools, bikes and boats for rent, and a full service restaurant. The food court food was carb heavy, but needed for the long days in the park. We have stayed in Animal Kingdom Lodge, Wilderness Lodge, The French Quarter, and feel The Riverside is a great place to stay.", "Date": "July 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pickhill, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAMAZING!!!\u201d", "Author": "chlobert", "ReviewID": "UR71704667", "Content": "I just came back from the Port Orleans Riverside resort and was beyond impressed with it.

I wasn't expecting a lot but clean a clean room is kind of a biggie, especially when paying the inflated Disney prices. We checked in without a problem although there was no offer of help for our bags-just a map and sent on our way. Our room was on the second floor-no elevators so we drug our luggage up the stairs and into our room. The room size was good; large enough for a family of five for a few days, although the trundel bed (for the 5th person) is only good for a very small person. Toilet and tub are in one room; double sinks are outside and there is a curtain that can be closed to separate this area from the sleeping area. This was a nice feature that allowed the kids to sleep a little longer. Room provides a small safe and a fridge, both nice to have. Grounds are beautiful-well kept and very nice to walk around. Disney transportation is very effecient and convenient-one of the ONLY reasons to stay on a Disney property. Cleanliness of the room left a bit to be desired. I realize humid Florida weather can be a problem but the mold/mildew on the shower tiles was unacceptable. I made coffee the first morning we were there-the coffee pot was not touched by housekeeping after that. Pot was not cleaned nor was additional coffee ever left. Basically, housekeeping made the beds and brought fresh towels-towels that felt like sandpaper, but at least they were clean. I am not a Disney fan to begin with and this reaffirms my belief that they are not worth the money paid. This hotel was listed as a moderately priced property-anywhere else it would be rated below that. I would compare the room to something you would find in a Days Inn or Motel 6.

We took an afternoon to tour the \"Deluxe\" Disney hotels, and we both agreed that the grounds at POR were much nicer. We ate at the food court 4 or 5 times and were always happy with our selections. We rented a car, but used the buses mostly. It was just much easier to have them drop us off at the front of the parks. There were a few waits in the evenings to return when the parks closed, but nothing out of line. We also rode the boat to Downtown Disney one evening - one of the employees in a golf cart stopped to pick us up and give us a ride when it looked like we might miss it!

We had taken the boat trip up the river from Downtown Disney on previous visits and the mansions looked spectacular. On this occasion, we arrived at the resort after a long flight from the UK, feeling a bit tired. Check in was very straightforward and the member of staff was very courteous. We were allocated room 5592 at Parterre Place, one of the 'stately mansions' on the other side of the river. The trek to the room was a bit of an adventure, but we managed to find it eventually. On arrival, the room was cool, and a welcome haven from the 95 degrees outside. We were disappointed to note that although the room had been prepared, there were potato crisps (potato chips) crumbs on the floor and melted chocolate was sticking to the carpet. Furthermore, there were a couple of dirty johnson cotton buds on the floor next to the wash hand basin and clumps of human hair were found in the drawers. We decided to complain about this and made our way back to the reception. The housekeeping supervisor was suitably shocked and promised to clean our room. It was late afternoion and we decide to head off to Hollywood Studion for a couple of hours. On our return there was a voicemail message from the supervisor offering a further apology and a refund of our first night's accommodation costs ($196 dollars). This was a reasonable response from Disney and it was gratefully accepted. During the holiday, we managed to go for a swim in our nearby pool every morning, around 7 am. it was glorious and my wife and I had the place all to ourselves. This was followed by a walk around the beautiful grounds, before breakfast and we were able to walk along the riverside at its peaceful best taking in the sights of all of the local wildlife, including ducks, squirrels, butterflies and othere birds. It really is quite spectacular and makes up for the slightly cramped rooms, where there is no place to sit outside. As has been said before, all of the staff are very attentive and brighten up your day. On one occasion, the battery on my hire car was flat, as I had left the lights on overnight. I asked for assistance at the reception and within ten minutes, a security car turned up at my car with a jump start. A tip was offered but politely declined by the very smart security lady, who told me that it was 'all part of the job' - most impressive. Two minor complaints worth commenting on: 1. We bought four of the refillable mugs a a cost of $14.99 each. Although we made great use of them over the two weeks, our strong view was that, compared to other restaurants outside Disney, the soda (Coke, Fanta etc) was over-diluted. This may be a cost cutting exercise by Disney and I welcome any other comments on this. 2. The bed bugs .in our room were rampant. All of us, except my daughter who wore lycra trousers at night, were badly bitten. I've been bitten before, but never to this extent and never at Disney. Finally, its important to say that we did have a great holiday, although we've probably had enough of Disney now for a few years. We would recommend thius resort to others, as the plusses far outweighed the negatives.

I would rate this as an average resort. I wasn't thrilled but I wasn't disappointed either. The rooms are definitely on the small side. We stayed in the alligator bayou, bldg 17. It was close to the small pool and laundry facilities but far from everything else. Walking isn't an issue for us but if it is for you then this isn't a good choice for you. It's a 10 to 15 min walk to busses and to eat or use the larger pool. Let me start with the room. Like I said it was on the small side and the beds were so creaky. Everytime you rolled over the bed made a noise. They are full size beds so if you sleep in a larger bed at home you might find this annoying. Some days our room was cleaned well and other days it was like they went in and changed the towels and threw the blankets up on the bed. I think they could have done a better job. I tipped and felt like they just took the money and left. We had a corner room and it was nice and bright with two windows. We requested a second floor room and roll away bed and we didn't get either one. You could hear toilets flushing all night. The grounds are pretty nice. It does look like the Louisiana bayou. Lots of greenery and very little flowers. I like the more tropical feel. We took the boat to Downtown Disney which was very relaxing. The food court was good and the bar with Bob the entertainer was a fun night. Someone mentioned that the bus transportation was slow. I just learned an inside tip from someone that drives for Disney. She said each resort is responsible for their own transportation. They all have budgets and create their own transportation budget. So if the busses here are slow it's the management at POR that sets the budget to hire the busses and drivers. Maybe if enough people complained they may increase their budget. I didn't find that an issue. Once we waited forever for a bus to Epcot while four magic kingdom busses went by. I wouldn't stay at this resort again because I want more of a tropical feel but it wasn't terrible either.

Our family has stayed at many upscale hotels, as well as your standard Hampton Inn/Fairfield Inn, etc. I would compare Port Orleans rooms to a nice Hampton Inn, and the grounds to one of the more upscale resorts we have stayed at. The grounds are gorgeous. Our room was recently redone so we had beautiful all new bedding, 2\" wood blinds, etc. It was spotless and we never saw a single bug, even being on the ground floor. We had a corner room by the pool which was especially nice. The rooms are very sound proof so we never heard a peep at night, even staying near the pool. I would agree with some of the other posts that the food court is not as good as the one at the All-Star movies resort, but remember that this resort also has a sit down restaurant where you can go for a nicer meal, something the All Star resorts lack. The gift shop is great. We never needed to call the front desk in the entire time we stayed there. The Old Man River pool is fun with a great water slide that our 5 and 7 year old girls loved. Here is the best hint I can give you....request a room near the food court and main pool. Otherwise you will be walking forever to refill your drink mugs or eat. It is a very spacious, sprawling resort. My only real complaint is that at the bus stops, there is absolutely no organization. It is a free for all. There are no \"lanes\" to stand in, so basically you can be waiting for 10 minutes, only to have a family walk up at the last minute, jump ahead of you in line, and miss a bus. Not fun if you are in a hurry. We are not a confrontational family, but I can't tell you how many times this happened. That is truly our only complaint though. Everything else was great. You will enjoy a stay here. However, having smaller children, we might stay at a more colorful, \"kid friendly\" resort next time like Carribbean Beach.

We live a little over an hour from Disney so we have stayed in the value resorts on numerous occasions but this was our first time staying in a moderate resort. I think I'm hooked. POR is absolutely beautiful, quiet and offers so much for kids of all ages. We did the carriage ride to French Quarter for the whole family and the Bayou Cruise for my oldest. We had the option of renting a surrey bike or boats at the marina. There's a piano entertainer named YeeHa Bob that performs Wednesday through Saturday but unless you get a dinner in the River Roost area and stay at the table until he performs at 8:30pm, be prepared to stand. The lack of space in this area is the only negative we experienced. We stayed in the Magnolia Terrace mansion of Magnolia Bend. We were in room 8912 and did not experience one single problem with mousekeeping. When we got to the room, the carpet had just been steam cleaned and the employee was getting his things together. He apologized for how he was in our way from getting in the room. Dude, seriously?!?!? We thanked him for making the place spotless. This was just a prelude to the service we received from mousekeeping on our trip. Around 11:30 pm the night before our check-out, my oldest daughter got sick. She spewed all over the pillows and linen of her bed. I called the front desk and received, what I felt to be, a sincere well wish for my daughter from the cast member and was told she would summon mousekeeping. We waited about 10 minutes and a young college student working at Disney showed up to exchange all the linen. Although it, technically, was his job to do it, he did it with care and did not rush though it. Not once did I feel it was a bother, even though I know it was not something pleasant to do. If I had to give POR one negative, it was the breakfast we chose. We only ate there one day and we ordered the bounty breakfast. The food was your typical fast food type in quality but the quantity is what I found to be poor. For nearly a $9 plate, the portion was that of a $5 plate. Although this was a negative at the time, it is also something we could have avoided and learned from had we eaten there on other days.

And I took my family to the Boardwalk Inn in December and the hotel and room are on another level. Now, that being said this is what I think of the Port Orleans Riverside. For the money it is good. The room is certainly smaller than the rooms at the Deluxe hotels. The rooms have two double beds instead of two queen beds. And our bed did was not comfortable. We were in Alligator Bayou and the room faced the parking lot. The pros were I pulled right up to the room and unloaded the car easily. The disney bus stop was fairly close to the room also. The hotel is nice looking. The negative for my particlular room was it was a pretty good walk to the lobby/food area. Now, we were right next to A swimming pool - BUT - my kids always wanted to swim at the big pool with the waterslide which was a decent little walk. But, they loved the waterslide. The buses ran pretty good. I am certain we never waited more than 10-15 minutes for a bus. We ate at Boatwright Dining Hall on our last night and it was excellent. My wife and I both had the prime rib. We also had an appetizer of shrimp over fried green tomatoes with a remoulade sauce drizzled over it. It was a good meal and the waiter - forgot his name but he was a Columbian - was outstanding. Sometimes an excellent server can make the dining experience. Overall, I was pretty satisfied with the hotel considering what it costs compared to some of the other hotels we've stated at. The discounts Disney is offering made it hard to pass up. We had 5 days of tickets (family of four) and four nights in the hotel for $1,260. I added on the Disney dining plan and we were out the door for $1,700. You cannot beat that.

We caught a promotion and got $50 in disney bucks along with a room that ran about $100/night. As always we go when the crowds are lower and the prices are better. The main snafu we had was at checkin, when the clerk said they had no record of any $50 gift card promotion. We had booked 2 rooms for ourselves and some family members coming along, so $100 was at stake. Rather than let it waste more time, we agreed we'd contact Disney and settle the matter later, especially as the clerk didn't seem to care enough to even call over management to ask if they were running this particular promotion. (we later got an apology and $100 in cards from Disney's guest relations manager in CA) If there is one problem at the lower cost disney resorts, it is that sometimes the desk staff seem undertrained and almost always \"new\" to the job. Some definitely are not really into the job, too. The resort grounds are nice, very lushly landscaped, if not always manicured to a high standard. Mowing quality was mediocre, some shrubs needed work, but overall the look is nice and most wouldn't notice the little flaws. The view from the dining facility is very serene, with the water wheel and a view of the \"river\" outside. It is very spread out, so if you hate walking you may want to stay at PO French Quarter down the street instead. It is somewhat more compact in nature. The theme is either ante-bellum mansions or Disney's idea of homespun backwoods. Ours was the latter, and the effect is quaint, not trashy. My wife really liked it a lot. The rooms are comfortable enough, quiet enough, and convenient enough. It's nice not to have an interior corridor where you hear late night partiers and doors slamming. I also love being able to park near the room and get to the car fast. There are not really any \"views\" from the room, even the water view rooms you probably want to keep the curtains drawn, because people are walking by a lot at times, and they always seem to be checking your room out! Cleanliness was fine, the bed comfort is typical (not great, but bearable), but I'd like to see Disney do a better job with in-room TV quality. A cheap old tube TV and scratchy cable doesn't really cut it for an entertainment corporation. You don't watch much TV while there, but for a modest cost they could upgrade it. In room internet is avail for $10/night but only if you plug in. No wireless in the rooms. The amenities are fine, though we didn't use the pools. The main building has a table service restaurant, counter service offerings, and a convenience store type place for snacks and small items. They also have a bar. The counter service tastes ok, but service there on two trips has been mediocre. One time they didn't even staff the pizza kitchen and people stood waiting and wondering. The layout is done wrong, causing people to pile up together. They also require you to order each different type of food at a different station. I would imagine this to be hellish for a family with small children each wanting different food types (burgers, pizza, sandwiches, pastas etc). As with most Disney fast food offerings, prices are roughly double what you'd expect in the \"real world\". Food really is where Disney gets familys' money, I think. Bus service is ok but slow. If you miss a bus mid day, you might sit there 20 min till the next arrives. And to me, riding a bus really saps away any pretense of \"disney magic\". I prefer to drive to the parks from this resort, whic is much faster, and if you've been there before and understand Disney's strange way of not telling you road names (only showing arrows to go here or there) it's easy enough. A $150 GPS also helps. I find the fact that people go to WDW in the summer and on holidays when it's packed proof that a large number of people are insane, but in the off season this is a nice resort for a relaxing trip. If staying with more than one small child, I'd stay off-site and get a much bigger place for the money. Just be aware that Disney charges $14/day!!!! for non-resort guest parking at the parks. But food and lodging will be less, and many non-disney resorts are nearly as close by. You will get to a park faster if you are driving from off-site than if you are taking a bus from this resort most of the time. But in the world of Disney the moderate resorts are the closest thing to a \"good value\" that you will find. The \"value resorts\" are said to be too noisy for many, too small, and lack the attractive peaceful vibe. But if you are simply a park commando, you might find them to your liking due to the reasonable price. If stopping in for a night I may stay here again, but in the off season one can usually find deals at Swan/Dolphin for a better more convenient location, and the Downtown Disney resorts are also a good alternative for a cheap but nice room that is close to dining and fun at night. Disney, being kid oriented, gets VERY quiet after a certain time at night around the moderates. If you like doing things after about 8pm there are more things to do staying other places. You may feel \"stuck\" at this resort if you do not have a car after dark. Budgeteers. Especially those with families to feed. Disney zaps you on food, park passes, and lodging. Consider staying at a more expensive resort there but for fewer nights. This will allow you to spend less time getting TO the parks and more time ENJOYING them. You can also pop back to the room for breaks and get more out of each day. Go in the off-season, when heat and crowds won't ruin your trip. Plan park outings for mid-week days, when crowds are smaller and you can walk on many attractions. Basically, a family man staying at this resort will be dropping maybe $500-$700 per NIGHT to stay here, eat, and have fun. Don't spend your valuable time standing in lines for attractions, waiting on buses, standing in more lines for food, and waiting to get somewhere. Turn a 7 night trip into 5 by going at the right time of year, staying in the right place, and you will probably have a better time.", "Date": "May 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAnother Great Stay at Port Orleans-Riverside\u201d", "Author": "johnnymike", "ReviewID": "UR65437740", "Content": "This was my fourth stay at Port Orleans-Riverside and I still love it as much as I did the first time.

We stayed in one of the \"mansions,\" not one of the bungalows. The staff was very nice and our room was kept clean. It wasn't the largest or fanciest room I've ever stayed in, but I had no complaints about the size and thought it was quite nice for a 'moderate' level hotel. I should note this is the only Disney resort I've ever stayed at, and have no point of comparison for their other in the park accommodations. Things I liked: beautiful grounds; lush trees; great attention to detail; great atmosphere. Several fun choices such as a horse and carriage ride. A fishing hole that was perfect for my 3-and-a-half year old (possibly not as much fun for older children). Multiple pool choices, including a good sized wading pool, outdoor hot tub, and fun water slide. Anoles and geckos which were fun to spot. Nice sized general store with a good choice of souvenirs. A dining hall which I think has a tendency to get crowded but we never had a problem (could be lucky). Babysitting service. A housekeeping staff with a whimsical sense of humor (for example - my daughter's Cinderella doll was placed with one slipper on, one off to the side like it had fallen off as in the movie). Several bus stop choices. Things I did not like: for our first day, the bus service was horrible. Not inconvenient, not less than perfect, not annoying - horrible. We waited over 45 minutes to see a bus to the Magic Kingdom before giving up and driving our rental car. Then we waited over 30 minutes to see ANY bus for our resort in the evening. We were in a line that extended to the end of the bus depot and witnessed MULTIPLE busses arrive for EVERY other resort before a single bus arrived for this hotel. When we called to complain (we were not the only ones who did) there was not even an apology, just the excuse \"they're doing the best they can.\" How good can the service be when literally every other hotel can get 2 or more busses in the time it takes ONE to arrive for one of the largest bus-needing resorts in the park? I repeat, the service was beyond bad - the WORST bus service I have ever experienced. An absolutely miserable way to start our vacation. Having said that, AFTER the first day, the service was VASTLY improved. Even though lines got long to leave the parks (it's a very big resort), there were at least busses arriving with a much steadier frequency. Naturally when it gets crowded you can expect to wait, but after that first day we didn't experience the horrible service again on our trip. I've read other reviews that mention the bus service - both good and bad - so it does seem to be spotty for this resort. I get the sense they can handle an average sized crowd, but are completely unprepared for peak levels. I hate having to mention the terrible bus service, since overall I really enjoyed our stay and thought the resort was very lovely with lots of choices to stay entertained. In many ways the resort was better than I'd expected. My recommendation would be to STRONGLY consider taking your car to head to the parks, especially if you are travelling to Magic Kingdom or if you will be travelling during busy times such as park close. It's just too much of a risk in my opinion - especially if you have young ones - to be left stranded by the possibility of awful service.

In the past we have stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge, & Grand Floridian - so I was hoping not to be disappointed cause lets face it those are both GORGEOUS :) I'm so glad we stayed here - I LOVE LOVE LOVE this hotel!!! We stayed in the Oak Manor mansion with a river view (I wasnt interested in the Alligator Bayou section). Sure the room could use some updating (mostly in the bathroom area) but it wasnt so bad that its a deal breaker...we were pretty much just there to sleep. We enjoyed the grounds and one of the most fun things we did on our trip was rent the surrey bike....that was a BLAST!!! Housekeeping was there everyday restocking our towels and making our beds...and always left a towel animal or did something cute with our daughters stuffed animals on the bed which she loved. Ate at the quick service restaurant often - which fortunately is open LATE. One night at Magic Kingdom the park was still open for EMH but we couldnt find an open restaurant to eat at, so we had to wait until we got back to the hotel. One night we even ordered pizza from pizza hut and they delivered it to the lobby. We were on the regular dining plan but it only has 1 table service, 1 quick service, and 1 snack - so on late nights that wasnt enough and we were STARVING :) The pool was fun - our daughter LOVED the slide, and I have to admit even us adults loved it. We also walked to POFQ and used that pool too - i think both are fine. Bus transportation was sometimes frustrating but mostly just at busy times. We would hang out in the shops in the parks and wait for the crowd to clear out before we would even try to catch a bus in the evening. And its good to have early bkfst reservations so that you can get in the park before it opens and then you dont have to stand in those crowded lines ;) We are on a mission to try all the WDW hotels so our next trip we are trying Wilderness Lodge - but I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

Having been to quite a few, there are a few things to know about Disney Resorts before booking to stay in one: 1) The higher price you pay to stay on Disney is made back by the Free Transport ANYWHERE in DisneyWorld, the service that takes any goods you buy in DisneyWorld back to your room for free and the non-stop Disney magic all day and night. 2) Disney Resorts do have bars, however these aren't the resorts to go to if your sole aim is to get drunk. 3) Disney standards of service, at all levels, are 100%...always. The food here is amazing as is the pool. It is well worth renting a boat and sailing on the River that runs through the resort. Disney staff amaze me always as they constantly go the extra mile to wow you.

This was a little challenging after long days at the parks, but was still not that bad.

The resort is very accommodating with their concierge, shipping, busing, and water taxi service. Our room was adequate - nice, slightly small, but clean. (After staying at another hotel the night prior in Orlando, we were relieved. So many Orlando hotels charge too much for mediocre rooms.) The Port Orleans Riverside beds are full-sized, which is fine for us. The bathroom was also small, but clean. What we liked were the two pedestal sinks and long counter above them. With the 5 of us, those sinks got a workout! What is especially nice is that there is a long curtain that you can pull to separate the sinks/bathroom from the sleeping area. Gave us a tad more privacy for getting dressed or if someone woke up a bit early. The floor was nicely tiled with slate, which was a great touch. There were lights over each bed with a dimmer switch for each. The room also has a ceiling fan. The dining hall was a zoo in the morning - a downfall. We never ate there but saw the craziness firsthand. We never ate breakfast because we were on the Disney Dining Plan, which doesn't cover breakfast. (We just ate lunch early). We always ate at the parks or resorts - not there. The restaurant/bar there did have a fabulous entertainer play piano and sing one night - and really had the crowd going. What fun they had! You won't wait more than a few minutes for a bus. Port Orleans Riverside has stops at the front and 2 other locations towards the back of the resort. This was nice since we didn't have to walk all the way back to the front of the resort. A bus stop was a short walk across the parking lot for us. There is also a water taxi that can take you to a few other locations at the parks. We rode to Downtown Disney on one, which was a relaxing ride. As far as being on the \"riverside\", we in a building next to the water (a pond). Still, it was very nice. The Riverside resort has mature trees and shade, which many of the other resorts lack. Our building was totally quiet. No interruptions or excess noise at all. We had neighbors and never heard them. Personal recommendations: 1. Stay here if you want a quiet and wooded location that's family friendly - as long as you don't mind the slightly smaller rooms. We only slept in ours, so it wasn't a big deal. 2. Pay for the Disney Dining Plan. Food's expensive! With the plan, we at $200 meals each night that were covered by the plan. Pretty nice having crab legs, steak, desserts.... Mmmmmm.... Drawback: 1. $10 a day for wired internet. We passed on it and went internet-free for 4 days. My email inbox was only full of junk when I came home and got online. 2. No elevator - we had to drag our luggage to the 2nd floor. (Somehow we managed to get the 2nd floor of every hotel we stayed at on our trip!)

Our room near the main bus stop was a real plus, especially when walking back to the room on a rainy afternoon. The resort restaurant was overpriced, as typical for Disney, but nicely themed and located in a wonderful timber framed building. The only real negative, AND THIS IS SIGNIFICANT, is that the Disney bus service to/from this resort is by far the worst that we've experienced, primarily due to heavy demand, but also due to long waits in the middle of the day. At Magic Kingdom, the Port Orleans (Riverside and French Quarter) bus stops are at the far end of the bus depot. On one occassion, the line literally extended beyond the bus depot, with approximately 5 bus loads of people ahead of us in line. Unfortunately, Disney was very slow to respond with more buses. Throughout our week-long stay, it was easy to find the Port Orleans bus line from a distance -- just look for the longest line (no kidding). Granted, we were there during a very busy spring break week, but Disney should know how many people were staying at this resort and planned accordingly. Last year we stayed at All Star Sports (very basic; poorly reviewed in this forum), but we never experienced such a problem with the bus service. Despite these challenges, we really loved Port Orleans Riverside, due to the beautiful surroundings. Note that the Port Orleans \"Riverside\" and \"French Quarter\" resorts are side-by-side, but significantly different; the French Quarter resort was less appealing to us, more of a cliche, but the French Quarter had a more kid-friendly pool, which we used because the Riverside pool was closed for maintenance.", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "south carolina", "Title": "\u201cWon't go back\u201d", "Author": "elwoodSouthCarolina", "ReviewID": "UR60422807", "Content": "As an annual passholder I have stayed at all the moderates in Disney this year.

Apparently, Disney herded everyone who fell for the \"deal\" into this one resort. I emailed and called prior to our stay indicating that I was facing knee surgery and would require a room near the lobby/food court. Upon arrival, my request was not granted, even though I practically begged. We were situated in building #24 - the very last building in its section. While not too far from a Disney bus depot (read on), it was extremely far from the main part of the resort. Furthermore, my silver earrings were stolen by the housekeeping staff -I have no doubt about this since I know where they were left and my husband walked back into the room while both a male and female housekeeper were there and they freaked when they saw him and scooted out before replenishing the coffee supplies (exactly where the earriings were left).

Needless to say the parks were mobbed - and for $75/day to enter a park, one should be able to go on all the desired rides and attractions. This was not the case - couldn't get into Pirates of the Caribbean on the day we went to the Magic Kingdom - it was a one hour wait on line (NOT!) and on one day in Epcot, a Fast Pass obtained at 10:30 AM for Soarin' had us coming back at 8:12 PM !

This was our family\u2019s first trip to Disney and first time staying in a Disney Resort. This resort was perfect for our active family. I picked a moderate resort because I knew with a toddler we would not be spending hours and hours at the parks, so I wanted somewhere that would be a nice alternative when we were not at the parks. Port Orleans fit the bill. First, I am not sure what the heck some of these reviews are talking about when they criticize the cleanliness and lack of updates to the rooms. We continuously saw things being cleaned, blown off and dusted. My husband even noticed the glass on the fire extinguisher in the hallway did not have a fingerprint on it! We stayed in the Alligator Bayou section, building 38. We did pay extra for a waterview room, which was nice in terms of convenience because we were at the front of the building, but I would probably not spring for this again. Since none of the rooms have balconies, the \u201cwaterview\u201d is not really necessary. At first I thought building 38 would be too far from the main dining hall and pool area, but for our family it was perfect. The kids enjoyed walking over the bridges and we actually liked the more secluded location. It felt like we were camping in the woods. Plus, we were equidistant from both the South Depot and the North Depot bus stops. This was great because on return trips (depending on how the bus traveled), we could get off at whichever stop came first. The room itself is your basic hotel room. I did not feel it was overly small or cramped. The two sinks were great for convenience. With a toddler, we utilized the fridge for milk and made coffee one morning (bring your own, the stuff in the dining hall is terrible!). My boys took turns on the trundle bed and got a kick out of that. We enjoyed going for walks around the resort. We also rented a surrey one morning and liked riding around for a change of pace. We LOVED the water taxi to Downtown Disney. What a great perk! We also walked over to the French Quarter section and rode the water taxi back one night. The pools were always clean and my boys enjoyed the water slide. We only visited one \u201cquiet pool\u201d which my kids found boring, so we headed back to the main pool, but it looked nice if you wanted serenity. The food court was fine. Even though it almost always had a crowd, we never waited very long for our food at the counters and we always found a table. We had the quick service dining plan, and the cashiers were always helpful and willing to explain it to us (and many other confused guests). I would recommend the chocolate croissants for breakfast and the make your own salads for dinner. Yummy! Overall, I would definitely stay at Port Orleans Riverside again. We loved the overall relaxing feel of the resort as well as the additional amenities that the moderate resorts offer.", "Date": "March 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cNice Grounds...Mediocre Rooms\u201d", "Author": "ohiomother", "ReviewID": "UR58996582", "Content": "The review were correct.

Plus lots of wildlife (we saw lizards, birds, rabbits at night...the kids loved that part) It also offers fishing, which our kids really enjoyed (their first catch). The main pool has lots of fountains, and a slide. The cafeteria is a food court, so you can get your food fast, especially important with small kids. There is an arcade. Also you can catch a boat ride to downtown disney. This next trip we are going all out and staying at the Grand Floridian for 5 days. But our kids really want to go back to Riverside for them to relive their first trip to disney memories. So we are switching to Riverside for the last four days. I the dad look forward to walking the path of tranquil tropical peaceful surroundings, which is very contrast to stay in the resort. Please note for those of you who are a family of 5. This is one of few resorts who can accomodate a family of 5. However what they call is a trundle bed, is a materess that pulls out from under one bed. I the dad slept in it, since I didn't want my kids to sleep on the floor. But after a day in the park, I could even sleep on the hard floor. So it's not luxury, but after you consider the price. It not that bad. Sleep is the last thing on my mind for going to Disney. Overall I the dad loved it. But this time we will spoil mommy and go to grand floridian for a 5 days.

The bus service is reliable (perhaps the odd wobble, but pretty good) and you can get a boat to Downtown Disney which is a lovely 15 minute ride.

What a fun experience they made it with little TVs. and quick too! - Great food choices - lots of variety and fresh options at the food court - all very quickly and very well prepared! I personally LOVE the fresh yogurt and berries and cereal station for breakfast!! We did not eat at Boatwrights... - Beds and room size and layout (loved the external vanity area with 2 teenagers trying to get ready!) - Grounds - WOW, just WOW.... Some people complain about the size of the resort and having to walk 10 mins to the central food court....oh, please. We stayed at the furthest point from the food court during a week that rained 5 out of 8 days straight and still loved the grounds... - Service - FAB! My daughter bought a Queen Amidala set at the Star War store in Hollywood Studios and it broke. We were on our last day and trying to leave the giftshop took back the whole package and gave my daughter a credit to buy anything that store, saving us a crazy trip to Hollywood Studios on the buses before we left! Pool - only got to use on one morning because of terrible weather all week....my daughter really liked it but did't get to try the slide because we were there too early and it wasn't open.... Buses - never waited very long at all. I'm not as picky on transport as some reviewers....at least there IS transport and it is professional and well done. That's soemthing that you're paying the premium Disney prices for that other resorts simply don't have. Possibilities for Improvement: - Covered areas during rainy days. It POURED down 5 of 8 days were there ...I mean from when we woke up until when we went to sleep!! Some covered areas outside would have been great. - Breakfast - they need multiple fridges to get drinks in the morning...the food lines are very quick moving but there is always a hoard at the fridges trying to get bottled drinks. Crazy dangerous when you're trying to balance trays with food. - Nothing else. All in all, this resort is EXCELLENT value if you manage your expectations up front.

It is a nice place to stay for people who dont want the small, cheesy overcrowded value resorts. The hotel is kind of a middle ground between the other moderate resorts. It isnt as hectic or busy as either the Cor Springs or Car Beach. It is more spread out & relaxing than Fr Qrtr. The grounds literally encourage you to walk out & around & enjoy the river views. The room itself was a decent size. Nicely furnished with more than enough storage room for a family of 4 for aweek. The shower could have been bigger, but it was comparable to most mid range hotel chains. The food court had great selections & was able to be very diversified. It overlooked the river & some of the Magnolia bend buildings. We stayed in Magnolia Bend... btw. The main lobby was nice & helpful for first time visitors. We checked in online 3 days earlier, it was very easy to do & we had no wait literally when we arrived. The resort provided us with good information about the ferry, DTD & the available recreation at Riverside. We enjoyed the pool & went one day to the Fr Qrtr pool. It looks fun, but not nearly as much as the Riverside pool which isnt pictured in the slide show. We had a great tie & will go again this December. The bus transportation was not bad, sometimes we waited about 15 mins, but it was due to where we were more than crowds. It takes longer to get from like downtown disney to animal kingdom, than the riverside resort to hollywood. So ofcourse, at times you will wait. The plus to this resort is that it isnot as far out from theme parks as others & so you can have a great time, stress free, on a relatively lower priced stay (compared to the resorts right at the theme parks).", "Date": "February 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ga", "Title": "\u201cThis palce is truely great!\u201d", "Author": "Debbie123Ga", "ReviewID": "UR55878629", "Content": "This is a great place to stay.

We stayed at French Quarter last year over Christmas and loved it. This time, French Quarter wasn't available, so we booked through Disney for a water view room, which was all that was available . First of all, the water view room was a view of a pool (which I knew could happen from reading previous reviews). That's all well and good, except for the huge travel groups of teenagers staying there that stayed up yelling until 1 AM in the pool area, waking all of us up even with the fan on in the room. Disney had a lot of conferences and large travel groups of teenagers in this hotel, so it wasn't nearly as relaxing as we had been told. Our first room ended up having a large amount cigarette smoke coming in through the bathroom vents, which I am allergic to (and so much for a \"non-smoking\" hotel). In order to move, due to the hotel being at capacity with all the groups, they made my husband come back to the room before 11 AM so they could clean and turn our room over to another guest. That morning we had a scheduled character breakfast at another hotel, so we lost at least 1/2 day in the parks getting back and forth and trying to move rooms. The next room we had was fine. The rooms are in need of a refurbishment, but the staff overall was friendly.

The hotel grounds are exceptionally beautiful and well maintained. The resort is quite large, so you should try to book a room that is close to one of the four bus stops on the resort if you are planning to use the Disney bus system. We were pleasantly surprised by the bus system, after reading some negative comments about it. Our wait at the bus stop was usually less than 10 minutes and buses take you to all the theme parks and also to downtown Disney. A time-saving tip for the hotel is to do the online check-in because when you get to the check-in area, there is a smaller line for those who have checked in online. If you buy a vacation package then you get a personalized room key that is the key to your room and also your admission to all the theme parks. If you put a credit card on file with the hotel, then you can use your room key to charge food and other purchases at all the Disney theme parks. This was great, because then we didn't have to keep using our charge card everywhere. You can also have express check-out when you have a credit card on file, so this saves time. We did call ahead 3 days and gave three choices of buildings that we would like to be in, but when we got there they tried to put us in a building that was very far away from the food court. When I complained about this, they were very accommodating and gave us the building that was originally our third choice. Although they don't guarantee room requests, don't be afraid to call ahead and try to get the building you prefer. We wanted a room that was close to the food court and also close to the bus depot. The room we got was in Parterre Place and had a beautiful view of the river. The room was very nice and clean and we were happy with it. We did eat at the food court quite frequently and the food there is pretty good. I would recommend buying the refillable mug for $12.95, because that will save you some money on drinks. The omelet station and the breakfast platter are very good and the food is reasonably priced. We also ate dinner there once and that was good also and they give you a lot of food for the money. The resort also has a free boat that takes you to downtown Disney. This is a scenic 15 minute ride and is quite nice. (Tip:A good place to eat in downtown Disney is the Earl of Sandwich. They are reasonably priced and have a wonderful selection of hot sandwiches, soups and wraps that are quite delicious.)

Bathroom was plenty big enough to use the toilet and take a shower. Not sure what the other people on here do in the bathroom, but it was fine for normal bathrooms duties (pun intended).

The bar at the main pool was fantastic. I found it was a great place to celebrate getting a new job with a few drinks. Resort is convenient to all parks. We rented an Expedition and drove down from NC and simply drove to the parks each day as 1) it is free to park if you are staying at a resort property and 2) it is easier to leave and get back to your room if you have a little one that needs a nap. We were not there long enough to utilize the boats to Downtown Disney, but loved sitting on the banks in the evening watching the boats go to and from before bedtime. All of that being said the Disney Port Orleans Riverside Resort was wonderful and a great experience.

There were walking paths everywhere, peaceful rivers, large shade trees, and small wildlife running around. The pools were very nice. The main pool was large and fun for the kids. It was a little cool at night, so the one hot tub at the main pool was very crowded. The food court was very nice. We never ate in the main dinning room. We typically ate at the food court in the morning, and ate there once at night after returning from the parks. We were able to get a cook to order pasta with shrimp for a quick service meal credit. It was delicious. We also enjoyed the piano bar where the piano player was very entertaining. Everyone sung along and had a lot of fun. Other activities that we participated in included taking the free river boat down to downtown disney. It was a very relaxing ride and convenient for getting around.

However, there was noone at that desk when we arrived. After waiting on the regular check in line I asked the woman why did I bother doing the pre-check in. Her only response was that they send the precheck people home by 10pm!!! I was not happy. Also, there were workers taking down the Christmas decorations and two of the men were sleeping on the couches in the lobby-not very disney like. We were a little concerned at this point as to how our trip would go. We checked in to one of the mansions on Magnolia bend. The room was very nice and clean except for some obvious mold and dust in the bathroom. It didn't really bother us though. There is a safe in the room that you can open with a key and it was very useful to us. It's only about 3-4\" thick though so you can't put anything bulky in there. The room itself was very nice the problem is that the walls are very thin. We woke up several times during the night when people flushed their toilet. Also, one night out next door neighbor was having a coughing fit and it was as though he was in the room with us! DISNEY REALLY NEEDS TO TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM WHEN THEY REFURBISH THIS HOTEL. The grounds are just beautiful. I read alot about people saying they were so far away from the main building but we didn't think it was so far. We had about a 5 minute walk to the buses and appreciated it so that we could see all the beautiful flowers and trees. We enjoyed the pool very much. Even though the temperatures were at freezing and just above most nights we still went in after we got back from the parks. It was heated to about 75 degrees and we alternated between that and the hot tub and were just fine. We did the Disney dining plan and had breakfast several times at the main dining hall. The Mickey waffles and bacon were good. The eggs, no matter where you were in Disney, were scrambled but very runny. We didn't care for them at all. Lunch was good as you have many things to choose from. I had custom made pasta one day and it was good but the portions are HUGE and the woman who was making it for me seemed absolutely miserable like I was bothering her or something.

The channel options were typical of limited cable (the ESPN channels, networks, CNN, HLN, ABCFAM, etc.) with no movie channels or channels like MTV. (I probably wouldn't even be mentioning this if it hadn't been so cold... keeping us in our room more than we wanted.) The resort is HUGE which is probably true of all Disney resorts. We had to walk rather far to and from the main building with the restaurants every day. Again, had the weather been nicer, we probably would have enjoyed this walk (the grounds are beautiful). The restaurant options are Boatwright's (moderately-priced sit-down) and the food court. We did not eat at Boatwright's but they seemed to have New Orleans style cuisine. We ate at the food court several times and liked our options. They have a dessert station, burger/chicken station, pizza/pasta station, and sandwich/salad station for lunch and dinner (they also have several stations (waffles, omelets, etc.) for breakfast). I thought the wait times were reasonable. Although we may have had to wait in line for 15 minutes once or twice, the waits were usually under 5 minutes for our food. The food quality was very good (especially liked the pasta and sandwiches), and the staff was very helpful with my husband's dairy allergy. We averaged around $20 per meal (for two people). You might want to consider buying a souvenir mug for $15 that you can keep and use for unlimited refills during your stay. There is plenty of seating in this area as well. We were fortunate to be put in a room that was close to one of the 4 Disney bus stations at the resort. It literally was 50 yards from our hotel room. This was convenient for picking up buses to the parks and downtown disney. Unfortunately, not all of the return buses stop at all 4 stations so we often had to walk from the main station at the front of the resort back to our hotel room (about a .5 mile away). We were happy with the wait times for buses as well. Our longest wait was maybe 20 minutes, but we probably averaged 5-10 minutes. Depending on the time of day and where we were going, sometimes we had to stand the entire time, but the longest trip to a park was about 15-20 minutes to Animal Kingdom. The resort is closer to Epcot and Hollywood Studios (maybe 10 minutes). I'd also recommend using the resort's complimentary Disney Magical Express for transport to/from the airport. Very convenient. There is also a small souvenir/snacks shop at the resort. They have a lot of the same t-shirts, toys, jewelry that the stores in the parks have. They also sell a few snacks, magazines, etc. I don't have much to say about the pools since the weather wasn't good enough for us to use (although some people braved the 40 degree weather!). There is a also a hot tub at the main pool.", "Date": "January 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rotherham", "Title": "\u201cPort Orleans - Riverside\u201d", "Author": "Ranxkilluslow", "ReviewID": "UR53089583", "Content": "1st trip to Disneyland.

We stayed for 10 days and had the food included where we had 2 main meals a day and 3 snacks which was great and could be use in any of the parks. food and drink would of been pretty expensive otherwise but plently of choice! great idea to use snacks on micky mouse lollys or bottle of water. The grounds are lovely, and the boat that takes you to the riverside and down to downtown disney was fantastic and the boat drivers were always helpful and sometimes singing disney songs. Downtown disney is worth visiting, it has plently of shops and food places (which you can also use your food package credits) they even have a christmas shop all year round plus a HUGE cinema. We went to disney quest which was included in our unlimited disney park ticket which was fun had plently to do and you could kill couple hours in there. The balloon ride is also worth a go and wasnt to expensive. I recommend going to port orleans riverside rather then french quarter as there is more to do and the food hall is bigger and better.

We had a water view room with a full view of the river that winds through the Port Orleans resort. We did the Express Dining Plan which is two quick service meals and two snacks per day per person.

Never saw a piece of trash laying on the grounds the whole week. * Staff was very friendly and helpful, which must have been difficult with the masses of people who were there and fighting, scratching and clawing for food and services. I don't know how they kept a smile on their faces, quite honestly. * The shuttle was always consistently-there, without ever having to wait more than about 10 minutes. * Food was excellent.....prices were extremely reasonable, I thought. Sometimes the lines and crowds were irritating, but hey.....everyone needs to eat, right? There are ways to avoid the crowds: don't eat when everyone else does! simple logic. Get up and out a bit earlier. * pools were heated, but a bit cool in the evenings -- too cool to swim, actually. My kids were a bit disappointed with that..... Yea, it's expensive.....no doubt about that...probably too expensive.....but hey.....we had fun. I can't complain.

We've stayed in both moderate and deluxe resorts and up until a few years ago have always had stellar service, immaculate rooms, and fabulous meals. I regrettably have to say that all three have gone down the toilet. Our last stay at POR was in 1998 and while the room wasn't spotless, it wasn't \"dirty.\" I wish I could say the same about this trip. I'll start with the cleanliness issues. The tiles in the bathroom area looked like they hadn't been cleaned in years, the bedspread smelled of something I don't even want to know what (we threw that right in the corner), you could build a pyramid with the amount of dust behind the nightstand, and the walls looked like a child had used them as a coloring book. Now, I'm not sure if I should be more disgusted with the housekeeping Disney employs or the guests who have obviously treated the hotel room like a garbage dump. It's very disconcerting to me and my family that people have so little respect for others property. That said, filthy floors and dirty bedding is unacceptable. The room was utterly disgusting. Smoking. I don't smoke and neither do my family members. I get that people are addicted to smoking (as disgusting as it is). That said, when a hotel mandates a non smoking policy in all rooms and specific areas are NON-SMOKING, it doesn't mean pull up a chair on the balcony and smoke away. While we didn't moan to the front desk (not that they would have resolved the issue, but we'll get to that later), Disney really needs to do a better job at enforcing this non-smoking policy because people obviously have a difficult time reading. Food court. Atrocious. I swear I thought I was waiting in the bread line for the last loaf. Where on earth have people's manners gone? Soccer moms were pushing 5 year olds out of the juice line so they could get on the next bus for Magic Kingdom opening. What an embarassment. Come on people. The cast members working in the food court were trying their best to put on a happy face, but it was evident they hated their jobs. I've never seen such forced smiles in Disney World. Boatwrights. We only ate there once but the food was fine and the people working there were quite nice. The gift shop also had wonderful employees. Boat to downtown Disney was very nice and the grounds were just gorgeous. The landscaping company must not be employed by the same company as the housekeeping staff. Main Pool. HORRID. We didn't even swim in it because of the vast amount of people swimming around. I don't even want to know what kind of \"stuff\" was floating around in there. The pool was closed twice during our trip due to \"accidents.\" You get my drift. The quiet pools were nice and we don't use hottubs but I couldn't help but notice the toddlers and preschool aged children jumping in and out bothering the other adult guests. Are hottubs for kids? The one time we used the bus was fine, but I can see waiting getting real old. Front desk personnel. Blah. No comparison to the front desk personnel at the Animal Kingdom Lodge or Contemporary (they appear to know what they are doing). I really want to cut the employees of Disney some serious slack given the amount of rude, ignorant guests we saw and I know they are over worked and underpaid. I can't help but think that Disney is their own worst enemy by wanting to jam as many people in their parks as they can and pay no regard to the little people working to make the parks clean and operate properly. :/ So, would I recommend POR? HECK NO. I'd stay off site and rent a car. You'll get clean rooms, better service, and much better prices if that is a big consideration. Our next trip in 2010 will be spent at the Ritz Carlton or Portofino in Universal (The beautiful Royal Pacific is the same price as a Disney moderate resort and much nicer, lavish, and clean). Did I say clean? It pains me to do it because we love Disney (have been on-site Disney guests since the late 70's when we were children), but we can't justify the cost anymore.

This resort, like all the others, is functional and should be a decent place for families to stay at. Now for some opinions which may offend some, but sometimes the truth hurts. After reading some complaints from all the resort reviews.....travelers should take note of the following. #1 - It's Disney World! There are anywhere from 150,000-250,000 people on this property at any given time. That right there should tell you a couple things. One, you will have no privacy. People will be coming and going at all hours and you should not expect a serene and quiet place. Yes, you will hear toilets flush, and yes people will be walking by your room. You didn't visit a retirement community where bedtime is scheduled for 6:00 just after The Golden Girls. Realize what you are getting yourself into. The restaurants will be busy, kids will be running around, and it may take a few minutes to catch that bus or get your buffet in the morning. Despite the sheer volume of people, everything runs pretty efficiently, or at least as efficient as you can be with so many people. Each resort will have 1500-2000 rooms. Just think about that. #2. For the money, the moderate resorts are fine. In all honesty, what are you going to do in the room other than sleep? Those reviews that claim they didn't get their 5-star experience need to realize once again.....you are at Disney. All the resort rooms are fairly clean, the beds are comfortable, and each resort has all the amenities you need. If you are that concerned about a big room, or a leather chair in your room, or the selection of TV channels.........why are you here in the first place? #3. Do NOT expect a relaxing trip. While the folks at Disney will do everything to make your stay enjoyable, this is a chaotic place. Just look at the numbers. Prepare to do lots of walking, lots of waiting, and be butts-to-elbows wherever you go. Don't like large crowds, then this probably isn't the place for you. Go sit on a beach somewhere and relax.

We were so impressed with our stay the first time at Carribbean Beach Resort that we were afraid Port Orleans Riverside would never measure up. We had nothing to worry about! Port Orleans Riverside is a sprawling beautiful resort. I get tickled at people complaining about the size of the resort and the walk to get the main area and/or bus stops. If you don't like to walk, don't to come to Disney World. We checked in about noon on the day of our arrival. We were travelling with our daughter's family and so we had requested connecting rooms. We paid for the upgrade to King bed for the two of us but still requested connecting rooms. When we checked in, they told us we had \"adjacent\" rooms but not connecting because we had a King. I politely explained that if that was the problem, then I would happily move to a doubles room and be connected because that was my primary request. The Cast Member went to her manager and explained the problem. He resolved this quickly and with a huge smile by explaining that in order for us to have connecting rooms - they would have to upgrade us to a water view room for free. Woo hoo! Happy Disney Customers! We were in our connecting rooms by 1:00 and our luggage arrived shortly (woo hoo Magical Express). We did laugh a little as the \"water view\" was merely a view of a tiny concrete pond outside our windows, but the grounds at this resort are SO beautiful that the pond was beautiful. The resort is home to a lot of amazing flora and fauna. We saw many different water fowl and birds and even saw some lovely wild turkeys. We were in Building 17 of the Alligator Bayou. I was a little worried that our close proximity to one of the satellite pools was going to be a problem when we would get home at 11:00 at night from the parks and be exhausted and children would be whoopin' and hollerin' in the pool. But, it was never a problem...once in bed with the heater/ac running, we crashed with no further thoughts about the pool or the people in it. The food court was awesome! They have a couple of stations that give you LOTS of choices for salads, pasta, omelets, sandwiches, soups, baked goods, etc. I stood behind many people checking out and the Cast Members would patiently describe how each person's Dining Plan worked. I saw an earlier complaint about being confused with how it worked. We were there for 8 days and I have to say, if you don't understand your Dining Plan, then that is your fault. Cast Members at every turn are VERY helpful about what is and isn't covered on your specific plan. Just ask until you understand. The gift shop was a really nice size and contained many of the items that we found in the parks so we were able to wait until the last day and do a lot of our shopping there. With regard to the Motel windows and the need for updating. Well, I think that some people are just never happy. The windows to the outside world never posed a problem for our two families. We left our curtains open during the day and shut them at night. If the curtains were open and I needed a little privacy I just used the curtain that separates the dressing area from the rest of the room and dressed behind it. As for the need to update, I would prefer that Disney concentrate on a good experience rather than worrying with matching someone's ideas about \"updated\" rooms. If you are at the parks during a \"busy\" time then you have a clue how many people that place shuffles through...EVEN with an update there are going to be scratches, dings and signs of usage. This place is a value AS IS, a room in a resort that has the grounds and amenities available such as those at Port Orleans and is affordable for a family of 6 is the bomb! NOTE: If you are a jogger, you will CERTAINLY appreciate the jogging trail there. Lack of free Internet Access is the one thing I do agree that needs to be updated ASAP. In today's world where we all depend on the internet for daily access to information, I think Disney has to step that up. However, on the other hand, we used our phones to update Facebook and answer emails, so maybe Disney thinks if they wait long enough it won't even be necessary to provide internet access. The Alligator Bayou rooms are not nearly as \"fancy schmancy\" looking from the outside as the Mansions section but are still awesome accommodations and the doubles rooms have trundle beds. Although our family didn't use it, had we wanted to use it, we would have appreciated it. We liked the Alligator Bayou. Mousekeeping was great. We got what we needed and towel animals too! Happy little Mousekeepers were more than happy to go away and come back when we were in the room too long... We used the Concierge to answer questions about park hours, best transportation suggestions for destinations and to print out boarding passes. If you like a beer with your Disney trip, not a problem at Port Orleans...We were able to buy beer AND they have a very nice bar. We never were able to work that into our schedule but it looked fun! They also have a nice sit down restaurant, again, our schedule had us eating most nights at the parks so we never got to use the resort restaurant, but it was crowded so somebody musta liked it! Overall, a huge thumbs up once again for Disney giving us a fantasy place to stay and enjoy our Christmas vacation with our family and grandkids! You can't go wrong with Port Orleans, Riverside! One note for those planning a Christmas vacation to Disney World. If I were to plan this trip yet again, I am now firmly convinced that you should get the heck out of town by the weekend before Christmas. Both times we planned our trips, although we wanted to be at WDW close to Christmas, the crowds become insufferable the weekend before and week immediately leading up to Christmas. Up to that point, the experience is truly enjoyable and magic. We never waited more than 30 minutes for any ride and with the use of Fast Pass and Extra Magic Hours we were able to get on all of the \"popular\" rides multiple times! and we never waited more than 10-15 minutes for the busses...

Port Orleans Riverside was fine: the rooms were a bit small (though all Disney property rooms are on the small side), clean, and in decent condition: about the level of a three star motel. The grounds are very nice and the service was fine as far as it went. Our two main complaints, and the reasons we wouldn't return are: A) THE RESORT IS TOO SPREAD OUT. It was a ten minute walk from our room to the main building. Which is not much of a hassle to get the bus or breakfast (it was a pretty walk) but was an issue if we wanted to run to the gift shop to get a bottle of water or a cup of coffee. Ditto the main pool: the satellite pools were fine, but the main pool was something of a hike and was the only one that had water slides and a bar/restaurant. B) THE BUILDINGS ARE LAID OUT LIKE MOTELS, so that the only windows in the room open up onto the outdoor hallway. This means we had to keep the windows closed the whole time unless we wanted to be on display-- there was a steady stream of traffic past the room in the AM. There were no curtains that might let in light while maintaining privacy - just venetian blinds and blackout shades. It's nice to wake up in the morning and be able to let the sunlight in. OVERALL: The deluxe resorts at Disney feel more like hotels and for us, are worth the extra money for the reasons stated above. But if those are not important to you, or if the savings trumps morning sunlight, then Port Orleans Riverside is a great option. We certainly were not disappointed with the room or the grounds. NO WIFI: This is a major Fail on all Disney properties: not sure why they don't supply WiFi at a kid-friendly resort and why they charge $10/day for wired internet.

We were on the top floor of a 2 story building and couldn't hear noise below or next-door from any other guests. The resort exterior was very pretty - nice landscaping, scenery, and nice to be near the water. The shuttles never were never that long of a wait from the resort to the parks - no more than 10 minutes. We did wait about 20 minutes for a pickup from The Magic Kingdom back to the resort at the end of the night, but they say that's the max you have to wait. We took the boat to Downtown Disney and it was nice. Hassle-free is always a plus with young kids. The food in the restaurant was surprisingly good for a cafeteria like setting.

We were guests at Port Orleans Riverside. While we had a wonderful time at the parks, our stay at Riverside was terrible. From the rude girl that checked us in to the nasty woman at the food court we really did not enjoy ourselves at the resort and never plan on staying there again. We had specifically asked for a king size bed and to be on a top floor. The girl said that we would not be able to get a king size bed but that we would be on the 2nd floor, so I thought one out of two I guess would be okay\u2026not so much\u2026.the building that we stayed in had 3 floors and double beds. For 5 nights, every night and all night we heard the toilets above us constantly flush. The beds were too small for us (newlyweds) to sleep together so after the second night of getting elbowed in the head by my husband I decided to sleep in the other bed alone. When we checked in, the girl did not explain anything to us and seemed extremely annoyed at any questions that we asked her, not exactly a warm welcome to the best place on earth. The room size was okay; however I found the room to be old and dirty. The bathroom really turned my stomach and the beds made my skin itch! The food court experience wasn't too pretty either! Stalking other guests for seats every morning to eat breakfast really wasn\u2019t too fun. The second to last day we were greeted by the rudest person I have encountered at the food court working the cashier desk who argued with us that we weren\u2019t doing the dinning plan as we should, which was really strange to us since we ate the same exact thing every day we were there. The busses were a nightmare! We waited an hour an a half just to get a bus to go to Downtown Disney only to wait another 20 minutes for the bus driver to load a handicap cart. The rest of our travels took about an hour to get anywhere and forget it when we were leaving the parks. The busses were extremely overcrowded. The bus drivers weren't exactly friendly. Our last visit to Disney we stayed at the Caribbean Beach which we thought was heaven, however we thought we would try to experience all that Disney has to offer and try somewhere different, what a mistake that turned out to be! I am seriously re-thinking ever staying at a Disney resort again! Our experience at Port Orleans Riverside has really put a bad taste in my mouth!

I would like to offer another terrific reason to choose Riverside - the power to eat healthy while on vacation. Of course, the ability to have some control over your diet is diminished if you are in the parks every day. However, when you\u2019re just hanging out at this resort, opportunities to eat better are abundant. I must begin by saying that I don\u2019t believe the Disney Dining Plan is an option for anyone wishing to eat in a healthy manner. Disney advertises the cost savings of purchasing the dining plan and how easy and stress free it is by having the meals prepaid. I\u2019m not really sure either of those advantages really exists. The savings may be there if you are willing to eat large meal platters with huge desserts twice a day. The plan certainly encourages you to eat more than you should or normally would because of what\u2019s included and, of course, you want to get your money\u2019s worth. I also can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve witnessed parents arguing in the dining court over what items are included in the plan and what aren\u2019t. How they can substitute item A for item B to leave no prepaid food item uneaten. Not exactly stress free. Taking the dining plan (literally and figuratively) off the table, I\u2019d like to point out some of the options that Riverside offers which won\u2019t derail all of the progress that you have made watching your nutrition at home. While few people actually want to diet while on vacation, these choices will at least help you to maintain and not gain weight and make more healthful choices for your children. There are four dining options at Port Orleans Riverside. They are Boatwright\u2019s Dining Hall, the River Roost Lounge, the Riverside Mill Food Court and Fulton\u2019s General Store. The best opportunities for clean eating are at the food court and general store. The store has many healthy snack choices and this particular food court offers an option not found at other food courts on the Disney properties - the create-your-own food stations. These fix it your way food stations allow you to enjoy freshly created meals by choosing from fresh fruit and vegetable selections and eliminate hidden calories by letting you speak to the person who is preparing your food and direct how your entr\u00e9e is being prepared. For breakfast, the create-your-own Oatmeal/Yogurt/Cereal station features slow cooked oats and yogurt. Some of the choices available for adding are fresh strawberries, raspberries, dried banana chips, cranberries and nuts. Cartons of skim or 2% milk are available in the drink cooler and artificial sweeteners like Splenda and Equal are available free of charge as a substitute for brown sugar. If choosing yogurt, ask the chef to go easy on the yogurt and heavy on the fresh fruits. For kids who like cold cereal, it\u2019s a great way to sneak in a serving of fruit for the day. Another healthy breakfast alternative is to purchase the multigrain bread at the pastry counter in the dining court or if you are feeding a large family on a budget, you can purchase a loaf of the bread and jar of peanut butter from the general store. Toasters, as well as microwaves, are available in the food court. Honey, jellies and jams and low fat margarine spread such as Smart Balance are available at the drink station. While the multigrain bread is perhaps not as nutritious as 100% whole wheat bread, it still beats choosing from the extra extra large pastries and muffins that are offered. Individual prepackaged cold cereals are also available in the food court and multi packs of cereal are available in the general store. Cartons of Skim or 2% milk can be saved in the refrigerator in your room. The cereals are also great as an evening snack. When you buy the multi-packs in the general store, they have disposable bowls and spoons behind the counter available free of charge. If they don\u2019t offer them, ask. Bananas, apples and oranges are available at the food court throughout the day. For lunch and dinner choose the create-your-own Salad or Pasta stations. The salad station features Romaine or Spring Mix salads with several fresh options to add such as cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, peas, mushrooms, onions, carrots, broccoli, chick peas and grilled chicken. The salads are mixed to order behind the counter. You choose the ingredients. One note: some of the salad dressings offered are not low fat or low calorie so asking for them on the side is very important. This way you can have control over how much is added to your salad. Not advertised, but available, is vinegar and oil. They also have malt vinegar packets in the condiment section by the toasters. This can be combined with another dressing to lower the calorie content. With the create-your-own pasta station, guests choose from three different pasta selections and then add ingredients such as marinara, sun dried tomatoes, fresh spinach, black olives, peas, onions, chicken or shrimp. The pasta dish is prepared to order in front of you. Ask the chef to go easy on the oil that they use to saut\u00e9 the vegetables in. Also, asking for extras of vegetables in place of the chicken or shrimp is also an option. Other healthy fare besides the Salad and Pasta bars are available such as turkey sandwiches with lettuce and tomatoes and PBJ Uncrustables. Again, you can make your own PBJ by getting multigrain bread and an individual sized peanut butter from the pastry counter and use the jelly at the condiment station. Soup options include selections such as Minestrone, Chicken Noodle, Chicken Gumbo and Tomato Bisque. Smaller side salads, yogurt, grape and melon bowls, sliced apples with caramel dip and veggie packs with low fat Ranch dressing are available in the drink cooler. For snacking, buy the refillable resort mug for unlimited access to two types of unsweetened iced tea, light lemonade and coffee. Or you can take the disposable cups from the guest room to use for ice water from the food court. Fulton\u2019s General Store also carries several different types of dried fruit, nuts and pretzels. If you must have the double bacon cheeseburger, fried fish, French fries or chicken strips, consider sharing a meal. The adult sized portions are generous. The desserts (brownies, cake, cookies, cupcakes, ice cream) that are offered in the food court and general store are huge \u2013 definitely enough for sharing. Or consider choosing a kids meal. Besides the smaller portions, the sides for the kids\u2019 meals include raw carrots and grapes. Bottles of water, apple juice and milk are included in the cost of the meal. Ask for meals to go. All adult meals can be halved and saved in the guest room refrigerator and warmed up in the food court microwave at a later time. As you can see there are several healthy food options available at Port Orleans Riverside. One sad commentary but convenient aspect to choosing the healthier fare is that the serving lines and wait times are always considerably shorter!", "Date": "November 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Forney, Texas", "Title": "\u201cThanksgiving week @ Port Orleans Riverside\u201d", "Author": "Rowedog", "ReviewID": "UR50300978", "Content": "I read several reviews on this site before my trip.\u00a0 I am at a loss as to how anyone did not enjoy their stay at the Port Orleans if they had an experience similar to mine.\u00a0 The room was simple but very nice.\u00a0 The room contained a table with two chairs, twin beds, TV, and a mini fridge.\u00a0 It was a pretty normal hotel room.\u00a0 It was clean and neat.\u00a0 The cleaning staff came everyday and it was very well maintained.\u00a0 The grounds were wonderful and very well kept.\u00a0 Disney does a great job of keeping everything clean and neat.\u00a0 This place was no exception.\u00a0 We greatly enjoyed our stay.\u00a0 The Magnolia Bend section is very nice.\u00a0 The buildings look like Old South plantation homes.\u00a0 The Sassagoula River runs through the property.\u00a0 There is a sidewalk that runs around the edge of the river and the property.\u00a0 I used it to jog every morning.\u00a0 The pools were heated but they were too cold for my taste.\u00a0 We had sandwiches in the dining area and they were very good.\u00a0 My son enjoyed the arcade.\u00a0 I saw a man performing in the hotel piano bar but did not stay for the show.\u00a0 The TV selection is limited with mostly Disney affiliated programming (It did include all the important ESPN channels).\u00a0 All in all I really enjoyed the stay and considered it a good value for the price.\u00a0 Our room purchase included meal plans.\u00a0 That made all the difference for us.\u00a0 It was great and I would stay here again.", "Date": "November 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "maryland", "Title": "\u201cOverall y nice place\u201d", "Author": "coricluster", "ReviewID": "UR50297762", "Content": "My girlfriend and I visited Riverside over the thanksgiving holiday. this was my first time to disney in about 18 years.

We saw squirrels, toads and fish. There is a big main pool with water features and a flume, and towels that you can help yourself to.

Eating at Disney has gotten so unfathomably expensive, we thought we'd give it a try. My family of 7 go to Disney every year. Usually we stay off property at Marriott Vacation Clubs. This time we got connecting rooms at Riverside. I'll try to give a list of pros and cons to staying here compared to off property. Pro's The grounds are beautiful, and the staff are all very pleasant. We were there at a busy time, and we didn't run into a single worker who was not over the top pleasant. Pools are very nice and well kept...and they are open late. Rooms were very clean, and in great shape. Double sinks that are separate from the shower/toilet are very convenient for big groups of people. Boat ride to downtown Disney is nice. Good departure from taking the bus everywhere. It's a bit slow, but enjoyable. Food at the food court was over priced, but of good quality. Many options, and all seemed pretty good. Disney magical transportation really was magical. They pick up your bags from the baggage claim belt, and deliver them to your room. Once we checked our baggage in Chicago, we didn't see it again till we got to our room. This was really really nice. Cons Place is pretty spread out. Some one mentioned they had 2000 rooms. We had a pretty long walk to the theme park buses. Rooms are nice, but small. And the beds are doubles not queens. After a week, we were looking forward to getting back to a larger bed. I would really consider staying off property with 4 or 5 people. That room gets pretty cozy after a week. They really could provide either free internet, or at least a free internet area. They charge a premium to stay here, and another ten bucks a day seemed kind of silly to me. There aren't many hotels left that still charge for internet. Comaprison to staying off property We really loved the resort, but We'll probably go back to staying off property. We really missed not having a kitchen and the extra space. Eating out is fun, but three times a day for a week started to be more work than fun. We also missed not having a car. For the most part, outside of being crowded, the disney buses were pretty convenient. It was, however, a challenge if you wanted to visit another hotel for dinner. You needed to give yourself a good hour, and be prepared to switch buses. Tough for a family of 7. Overall, it's a really nice resort. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it, especially if you haven't been to Disney before. However, if you have a larger family, and like a bit more flexibility, renting a car and staying off property is probably a better choice. Be prepared. You will have to wait for buses once in a while, and there are 2000 other families there, so things can take a while to get done.

The room had a refrigerator and a coffee pot. We didn't eat at the restaurant but did eat a few times at the food court.

The breakfast spot was mayhem every morning - you had to wait in line at many different stations to get a full breakfast together - on the flip side, the staff was very pleasant in the restaurant and 'cafeteria' though. Food at Boatwrights - the sit down restaurant was very good too. Also, not having wireless internet was a major disappointment. Get with the times Disney! What's worse, the wired internet required a half hour conversation with the IT guy on the phone and costs 10$/day. I've stayed places less than half the cost that have wireless for free.

It was anything but a restful trip! We have been to Disney a few times and usually stay at Animal Kingdom. We thought we'd save some money and try this Moderate hotel. What a mistake! Since there are less Pro's than Con's, I'll review them first. The hotel property is well decorated with vegetation. It was scenic and there were a lot of flowers, plants and local animals. It made for a nice walk. There is also a dock that rents boats and bicycles. I would definitely recommend this as the boating down the outdoor hotel river is relaxing and beautiful. It's a bit pricey ($45/hour for a 2-person boat). Now the con's: The room itself has a outside door, so anytime you leave your room, you are outside. Not too fun if you want to walk to the lobby and it's raining. This also means there is only one window in the room that points to the outdoor hallway where all guests walk to their rooms. This, along with the MANY children running around, the paper thin walls, really squeaky beds, and early morning ground cleaning (yes, gas blowers and trimmers going at 7:00am every day!) made our room very loud. Plus, any time our neighbors flushed the toilet or took a shower, we could hear it very clearly. For security and privacy, I left the blinds shut since every guest in my building was walking by. This made my room very dark--who goes to Florida to not see the sun???? Housekeeping was no better. Every morning they entered our room at 8:00am. When they saw we were still sleeping, they left, but you'd think after the second or third day that they'd realize the pattern (even with the privacy sign up!). They did a good job cleaning, but there were a few times when we received bath towels that looked very old (mine had a huge tear in it!). The hotel is just around 2000 rooms I think. The hotel was not full when we were there, so I can only imagine the chaos when it is full! On the entire property, there is only one 10-person hot tub. Every night we tried to use it, it was full of unsupervised kids or teenagers drinking. Breakfast was an absolute nightmare where people were bumping into each other, no tables available, and staff that was so overwhelmed that food was just slopped on your plate. The buffet was the only option for breakfast as the sit-down restaurant was only open for dinner (5:00pm to 10:00pm). In terms of service, this was some of the worst service I received--ever. After the second night, I called the front desk and politely requested to be connected to Animal Kingdom as I was uncomfortable and wanted to switch hotels. The woman would not transfer me and advised the only way I could speak with someone at AK was for a manager to call me back. After 20 minutes of not receiving a call back, I called my front desk again. It was a 10-minute fight to be transferred to the AK, but I finally was transferred (the woman from AK was extremely helpful). Ultimately, we chose to stay at our hotel and \"rough it out\" but that proved to be a mistake that my husband and I both regret. On the night before my departure, I tried to check in to my flight (via my phone--Disney charges $9.95/day for internet). I was already checked in so I could not change my seat or pay my baggage. After much confusion and talking to about 6 different people, I learned that Disney checked me in to my flight (without my knowledge or consent). It took a 20 minute call to the airline to clear up the situation. My airline does not allow pre-paying of luggage via phone and Disney had no way for me to do this online (no business center or check-in kiosks and in-room internet is $9.95/day). When I asked for a 15-minute complementary internet session in my room just to check in, I was rudely denied by 2 different people who told me to use Disney's luggage service. So, I paid Disney, received a receipt and took my baggage to the airport....only to find that my airline had no record of my payment and I had to pay for my luggage AGAIN! This seemed to be common as the rep at the airport told me she deals with this many times per day and there were at least 12 other people behind me that had the same problem with their luggage. I'm still fighting Disney to get the refund of their baggage \"service.\" Overall, this was one of the worst vacations I've ever taken. I was nickled-and-dimed for every extra service (and double-billed for a few things that I had to clear up prior to check out), the staff was rude and unhelpful (I can't even count how many times I heard \"I'm sorry\" followed by \"You'll have to go talk to someone else\"), check out and luggage service was horrible, the Disney Magical Express shuttle service to the airport was 30 minutes late, the rooms were dark and very loud and the dining options limited. If you have a family with lots of small children and you are going to Disney on a budget, you might not mind this hotel. However, if you are trying to relax or want genuinely caring service or a non-hectic return home, stay away from Port Orleans!", "Date": "November 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "33935", "Title": "\u201cDisney stay\u201d", "Author": "70cuda33935", "ReviewID": "UR48913867", "Content": "awesome, not one bad thing to say. i would stay there even if i didnt go to disney", "Date": "November 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Destin, FL", "Title": "\u201cWe had a great experience at Port Orleans.\u201d", "Author": "dunfordhome", "ReviewID": "UR48674459", "Content": "We stayed at Port Orleans in September 2009, during our first trip to Disney World.

We dined on property for breakfast one morning and found the prices and options to be quite fair. We paid $20 total for 2 full breakfasts (Mickey Waffles, pancakes, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, biscuits and juices for both of us). We took advantage of the boat which ferries between the resort and DownTown Disney. It was a beautiful scenic tour. Both times we had great captains that were funny and entertaining and gave educational tours along the way.

Since we had never been, I definitely wanted it to be magical for my 5 yr old daughter. I booked the resort primarily based on reviews and of course we had free dining. However prior to our arrival, I think I was looking at to many reviews, and was second guessing our decision. We arrived about 2:00 via ME (Magical Express - see below for comments) and since I previous had checked in \"online\", I headed to that section of registration. I personally think people get too rapped up in \"where is the best location\" or \"which rooms should I request\". We did not have any special requests, however, I was prepared to ask for a room change, if I thought it was going to be too far of a walk to a bus stop or a pool! We were greated immediately and were assigned AB building 14. Pretty much the closest building to anything. It was perfect! a 1 minute walk to the food court, 2 minute walk to the pool, and a 2 minute walk to the main bus stop via the shortcut through the back parking lot. No complaints here! The rooms themselves are pretty dark. Everything was clean. Loved the area near the sinks, that allowed for the curtain to be closed. Great for families, one can start getting ready while the others sleep. Our mini frige worked perfectly...actually if you placed items in the far back - they froze....perfect for water!!!! I really have no complaints about the room. However, they are definitely starting to reflect some age and wear and tear. The bath area is one are that needs an update. Our shower handle kept sliding down from warm to extremely hot, so needless to say, my daughter didn't like that! The tiles did show some wear - no mold - did look like it was recently caulked. Just looked pretty dated. Shower curtain rod was all rusty. Other than that, it was kept clean and tidy. Every day we received towel art...which my daughter tried to recreate, unsuccessfully. Food...we only ate at the Food Court a few times, mostly for lunch, and once for dinner. Decent selection. In the am, get there before 8:00 am to avoid the crazy madhouse! Lunch time was also busy, however just more spread out. Our daughter liked the kids pizza and ice cream sundae station. We liked the Turkey Sandwiches, Make your own Salad and the bakery items. My only complaint would be more related to the guests of the hotel, who just seemed rude, or maybe just in a fog. We opted for the refillable resort mug, which worked out great for us, as we were in building 14 and could just walk over quickly for a refill. Pool - always crowded. Chairs come at a premium. However there were always some available in the shaded areas. The main pool area seemed small to me, however the theming was decent. The restroom at the pool always seemed dirty to me. Decent drinks at Muddy Waters. The quiet pools are deep. I thought my daughter might enjoy a change of pace and I brought her to the quiet pool near our room. WOW - it was 4 -6 feet deep with very little being 4 ft. Gift Shop - Nice size with a decent selection. We decided to buy 2 bottles of Rum at 12.95 each. Much cheaper that $6 a drink at the bar. So, now you know what was in our resort mug! :) Buses - Mostly good experience. We waited only a few minutes each time and it seemed like we rarely shared with POFQ. We only had a few bad experiences with the buses - mostly because we used them to go to another resort. We went to the Poly for dinner and it took us 1.25 hr to get there. Our mistake was taking the bus to Downtown then switching. We should have taken the bus to MK then switched or walked/mono etc. A few times they were standing room only - which is to be expected. Magical Express - the name says it all. Not one problem! We waited maybe 5 minutes at the airport and off we went. POR was the first stop. Our luggage arrived about 3 hrs later - we think. We didn't care we went to Downtown Disney for dinner. We did use the resort check in on our return trip and once again - all went like clock work.

The cleaning staff did a great job fixing up the room each day. Washcloths and hand towels were made into different shapes each day which we looked forward to. They started cleaning the rooms early (about 8 - 9am) since most people are heading to the parks. This is great when in case you want to go back to the room for an afternoon nap because your room is already cleaned. The concierge staff was wonderful (Allison - you're the best!) and went out of their way to help you book a dinner reservation or offer suggestions since there is SO many opportunities.

You can take the water taxi to Port Orleans-French Quarter and to Downtown Disney. Downtown Disney offers a respite from the parks: shopping, live bands, special \"street\" performances, and restaurants. Great for families as well as adults w/o kids. Portebellos is a fantastic Italian restaurant that will surely leave you with a full stomach. In summary, Riverside was a nice hotel, close enough to WDW parks, and clean. For our family, it sufficed however I would have personally liked a bigger room with queen beds (I'm a big guy) like at the Polynesian Resort but that was the upper tier WDW hotel with their upper tier cost. If you have four in the family, be sure to ask for a trundle bed. If you have five or more, you may want to consider booking two rooms. All said and done - WDW proves it has cornered the market on superb customer service.", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA great place to stay\u201d", "Author": "stesuec", "ReviewID": "UR46862945", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for 14 nights and what a beautiful resort.

It was such a lovely resort....where do I start? ROOMS The room although not huge was more than ample for myself and my friend who was travelling with me. Unlike at the value resort this room had 2 sinks, which was fantastic for getting ready at night and in the morning. We stayed in Alligator Bayou Bldg 26, a short walk from the main complex which offered many amenities. The Bayou rooms, are themed with rustic wood carved beds, lanterns and a wooden trunk and furniture. They were VERY soundproof, although we were on the 2nd floor so perhaps that helped. Bear in mind there are no elevators for the Bayou rooms so if you are needing access to an elevator, you should stay in the Magnolia Bend section across the river ( themed like southern mansions with elevators). Room service was impeccable and our room was a welcome retreat at the end of a tiring day. RESORT AMENITIES There is an onsite restaurant Boatwrights, that serves plentiful portions of southern themed meals, as usual the Disney servers were friendly and service oriented...no complaints. The food court was large and had wonderful selections including an onsite Bakery with warm cinnamon rolls, squares and cookies. The food court could be crowded at peak times, but it was never hard to find a seat. Fultons general store had LOTS of merchandise including clothing and sundries..... great shopping options. In addition there were bike and boat rentals, horsedrawn carriage rides and power boats. Transportation options included Boat Service to Downtown Disney, as well as Buses to all the parks. From experience we found it best to wait for all buses at the South Depot ( Main Depot) as they seemed to be faster from there. Only negative.... despite requesting an Alligator Bayou room for months before our arrival and following up on the day of our arrival, they initially didnt have one for us, saying they were not available.....after speaking with the Manager on Duty one magically became available..... I was courteous and explained how special our trip was... and Disney accomodated. I have always found that the kind approach when dealing with service people is the way to go, and this once again was the case. The resort grounds were peaceful, despite there being hundreds of people on property, the design and landscaping of the property is amazing, would not hesitate to return. Last thought, if you are unsure of French Quarter or Riverside, I would recommend Riverside, it is the main complex with full amenities....French Quarter guests need to come over to Riverside to take part in all the fun there... as welll French Quarter had minimal lush landscaping and had a stark feel to it...... just my opinion.

Between special deals sent from Disney via internet, and being able to use Disney Visa points, got an exceptional deal. We had stayed on 2 other properties before (All-Star and Caribbean Beach) so decided to give Port Orleans a try... Check in was a challenge. We arrived at 1:00 pm, so not the peak time. We had dione express on line check in on the computer, so there was a 'special' line set up for us. Well, the wait in that line was longer than the others, as only 1 person was staffing it. I would suggest that you don't even bother with the express, if this is the norm. The other problem with the check in was that they had secured the room on the credit card, and had already charged the card before my arrival. SInce we w ere using DIsney points, they had to do a credit card return transaction, which took some extra time. They also didn't give us a room per my request (no parking lot view) I had spoken with reservations agents at least 3 times about that, and it was supposedly noted. Of course, they were directing us to our room, which we could clearly see was in the parking lot. We complained, asked to see a manager...the room was changed for us but all new key cards had to be made, etc. The room itself was fine. We had a king sized bed, and there was just enough room for us not to feel cramped. The landscaping and grounds were beautiful, and were very appealing. There are nice walking paths which provide lots of places to walk. Be careful though--the staff fly around on golf carts and we were almost bowled over several times. Another perk of the Port Orleans is that you can ride a 'water taxi' to Downtown Disney. We did this several times during our stay, which cut out having to look for parking.

We stayed here for our honeymoon and although it wasn't a very romantic hotel it was wonderful as we stayed in the parks most of time. We booked a standard two bed room, and at check in we asked for an upgrade to a king bed, but they weren't able to do it because they didn't have any available. The hostess seemed very willing to do it, but couldn't because there just weren't any available. Also, if you're on your honeymoon, mention it at check in and they will give you \"just married\" pins to wear during your stay. We got so much free stuff with those pins, not to mention a ton of staff members congratulated us. The room was nothing special, but the double sinks were nice and the room was spacious and clean. We didn't get any towel animals even though we tipped everyday, but that could be because we didn't have any kids with us. The grounds were beautiful. We stayed in the Magnolia Bend part and all the buildings were very beautiful. The pools were also nice. The main pool had a waterslide and looked like a lot of fun, but was pretty crowded during the day, We used the quiet pool right by our room only once because it was a little too cold for us. We used it after it was technically closed, but we were quiet and it wasn't an issue. The food at the hotel was okay. We ate at Boatwrights one night and the service was good and the food was okay. The cafeteria wasn't anything to brag about. I had the build your own pasta and it was burned. Also we found that the breakfasts were actually cheaper in the parks. The shuttle to and from the parks was very convenient. Our room was right next to the East depot, but by the time the bust got to us it was pretty full and we usually had to stand. We quickly realized that if we walked the short distance to the South depot right near the gift shop and hotel restaurant the bus was nice and empty. The gift shop was very adequate with lots of souvenirs and clothes. Also, I recommend using the feature where you link your credit card to your room key to pay for things in the park. It was so convenient to have one card for everything (room key, park tickets, and credit card). I didn't think it would be so convenient, but I'm glad we did it because it was one less thing to worry/think about while on vacation. We used the shuttle service (Magical Express) to and from the airport and it was great. It's wonderful that it's included in the room price. We didn't have to wait long either to or from the airport and it was very comfortable. We didn't use the feature where they pick up your bags from baggage claim because we booked our trip too late to get the luggage tags, so I can't comment on that. A word to the wise: If it rains a lot during your trip some of the walkways around the hotel will probably flood. We didn't mind because it just made it more of an adventure. Also, I think most (if not all) of the gift shops, including the hotel gift shop, sell ponchos, but they hide them behind the counter so you have to ask for them. This hotel was great if you aren't looking for something too fancy. It was definately a step up from the economy resorts like Pop Century. Even though we didn't have any kids with us, I think I would be good with kids, too. The shuttle to and from the parks alone is probably worth the difference in cost of staying in an \"off campus\" hotel and a bona fide Disney hotel.", "Date": "October 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed our stay at Port Orleans\u201d", "Author": "Tayjha", "ReviewID": "UR46390861", "Content": "I'd like to first compliment the Port Orleans cast members.

Our room was in Acadian House(mansion side) right next to the quiet pool. As we walked to our room we did notice a maid cart with cups sitting right next to the dusters.

They gave us a room in Alligator Bayou, it was nice, but rustic whereas the Magnolia Manor room was more elegant looking. But it was close to the food court, and was had a pool really close. The complex is extremely large and getting lost is easy to do. But this is where the trouble began, when we changed room, they gave us a new key and told us we had one more use on our old key to retrieve our luggage . We we got to the old room the key wouldn't open the door, so we walked all the way back up front to fix it, then we went back and again the key doesn't work, then we go all the way back again. When we get back to the room the key still doesn't work after 3 tries and a family is sitting outside my door. They had been given my room, that fast. They entered my room with all my luggage, my purse, money everything we own. But she said when she saw someone was still in the room, she closed the door and left, she was honest, but what if it were someone who wasn't. Finally we got our stuff out and went to the other room. But I called the manager on duty, to tell what had happened and that I wasn't happy and he pretty much called me a liar, telling me they would not have given those people our room. Other than this horrible ordeal, the room was decent and the food court was good. We had the south depot bus run close to where we were, so that was good. The buses come frequently, so you don't have to wait very long. The pool was nice and the ferry was relaxing. Our room was cleaned everyday and that was good.

It just gave us less reason to feel guilty about eating all the wonderful food! We stayed in Alligator Bayou #28, which was pretty far from the lobby, but the walk was very pleasant. It was very quiet also. Our room was ultra clean; we had 6 clean towels, new toiletries, and room cleaned every day. They even left us a new towel animal every single day of our 5 night stay.

We were there the day that the Free Dining Plan started, so I think the hotel was filled to capacity. Took the Disney Magical Express over to the hotel and got in line for the express check in. Only had to wait 1 or 2 minutes, although on the day we checked out, I noticed ALL check in lines were extremely long. We were in building 27 in Alligator Bayou, which at first, looked like a haul from the main building, pool, etc. It really was not far at all. They honored our request for a first floor room, which was so much more convenient. Since we were somewhat centrally located, we were relatively close to a bus stop, another pool and the laundry facilities (which i did use--no problems there). The main pool was great, as was the bar by the pool! They even had a small smoking section where my husband could enjoy his cigar. We ate at both the quick serve food area (Riverside Mill Food Court), which was good and had everything needed for a quick breakfast or lunch, and at the sit-down restaurant, Baotwright's, which was delicious! Great food there. Keep in mind that it was free, though, for us. If I had to pay the prices they charged, I would say it was a little overpriced for what you got. The boat ride over to Downtown Disney was very convenient--we did that a few times. And the bus service to the parks is super-convenient. Out of all the trips we took to the various parks, I think the longest we waited was 10 minutes. The caricaturists in the lobby and the hair-wrap staff were excellent. The entertainment in the lobby bar were great as well! The housekeeping service was just so-so. This is the closest thing to a complaint that I had with our experience. Now I don't expect perfection at all, but I just don't think the attention to detail was there.

She attached a $5.00 bill as a tip, to the note. Much to our surprise, after returning from our day at the park, the note was still there, the $5.00 bill gone and NO towel animal.

We also had the free disney quick service dining plan which was great, you got far too much to eat, and we didnt even use all our meals. We caught the bus from the south depot (main depot) and didnt wait much longer than just over 5 mins for any bus. There are 4 bus stops in riverside, and during the busy seasons i can imgine that it will not be good getting a bus from any of the smaller stops.", "Date": "October 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "ronfunlover", "Title": "\u201cRoom was not what was expected?\u201d", "Author": "ronfunlover", "ReviewID": "UR45735643", "Content": "My girlfriend and I stayed 28Sep-01OCT and were not happy with the room conditions at the hotel.

However after another 30 minutes of waiting for the call that twice never came I drove to the front desk and spoke to a supervisor.

We traveled with our two young children, one set of grandparents and one great-grandparent, and we requested two connecting rooms with a water view. Despite reviews I've read where people haven't received what they requested, we received everything we requested. Our connecting rooms were located on the 3rd floor of the Acadian House (which has an elevator) and we had a view of the quiet pool. I would highly recommend Acadian House (at least, where our room was located), as it's not a long walk to the main pool and dining hall, etc. Our rooms were nice, if not overly luxurious. They suited our needs perfectly. We especially liked the fact that the two sinks were separate from the toilet/shower and that there was a curtain separating the sink area from the rest of the room. We arrived at the resort before noon on our first day of the trip and we were pleasantly surprised to learn that our rooms were ready. We were very pleased with that. Perhaps it was due to the time of year. We flew to Orlando and used the Magical Express to travel to the resort. Everything was very organized and we received our luggage later that day without any problems. I would highly recommend using the Magical Express if you're flying to Disney. When we checked out, we were also able to check into our flight at the hotel and the agent was able to get our seats together on the airplane (hint: not all of the agents know how to do this...there's a trick to it and it definitely involves luck too). We left our luggage at the hotel and they took care of getting it to the airport for us. No problems there, either. The only thing I wish I had known before choosing this resort was more information about the bus system. We were visiting Disney during the off-peak season, so it was not super-crowded in the parks; however, Riverside was sold out. We found that we had to wait up to 30 minutes for the bus to arrive. Most of the time we waited between 15 and 20 minutes for the bus to arrive (usually 20), and sometimes we got very lucky and got right on the bus. There didn't seem to be any pattern to when the buses would arrive. Additionally, all of the buses except those going to the Magic Kingdom stopped at the French Quarter first. We had to stand on the bus many times, which wasn't a big deal for us. And all but one time people stood up to offer their seat to our 81 year old great-grandmother and the person in our group who was holding our infant. However, when leaving the parks (no matter what time of day), Riverside always had the longest lines and the fewest buses. It was a bit frustrating. Also, be aware that if anyone is in a wheelchair, they are loaded into the bus first and it can take quite a while. We had to wait a number of times for wheelchairs to be loaded. All in all, Riverside is a nice resort and I don't have any complaints about the hotel itself. We are planning to return to Disney in a few years, but we will stay in a resort on the monorail line to make transportation easier. We had an infant with us this year and had planned to leave the parks in the middle of the day so he could take a nap, but with the travel time of up to an hour to get back to the resort & back into our hotel room, it wasn't worth it. Overall, I felt like we lost a lot of time waiting for the buses and riding on them. If you stay in this resort, I would recommend staying in the park all day. There is a way to \"work\" the bus system, so if you park hop, look into that (for example, we wanted to go to the Magic Kingdom from Downtown Disney but you can't go straight there. We took a bus from Downtown Disney to the Grand Floridian and then hopped on the monorail for one stop to the Magic Kindgom).

That took the 2nd trip to find out. The gift shop is sufficent but has a very small grocery attached that only sells beverages, Entermain cakes, chips, some first aid items, and candy and cigerettes. There is a piano player that jokes around while playing piano a couple of nights in the lounge and that is fun as he gets the people there laughing and singing and kids even sit quietly there. We had cake in the resterant and it was really good. The food court has good pasta dishes and wonderful chocolate crosiants as well as yogurt. The yogurt is almost $2 but the pastry is average price. They have very small bottles of wine also. Then there's the hamburgers and chicken dishes and fries. The main theme pool is nice but can be a difficult walk in the very hot months. Luckily there are some regular pool near the behind the hotels to share. The Ferry can take you to visit the other pook at the French Quarter or to Downtown Disney. Just make sure to use the safe as I lost all my ID and wasn't sure how that happened as I thought for sure I'd left it in the drawer.

Needless to say, the maid was not tipped at all. I find this just inexcusable. I also walked around in a clean pair of socks in that room and they were filthy on the bottom after that. It was gross. The food court and Boatwright's had very good food. I have no complaints about the food or service in there at all. We had the deluxe meal plan, so we ate very well. I would highly advise getting the meal plan, as the food is very, very expensive. I would never go back to Disney again without it. We never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a water taxi or a bus to go to the different parks. That was awesome!

This resort is located near the French Quarter and is within walking distance to each other. The resort staff were very friendly with the exception of the concierge we dealt with who was a little rude when we asked to make a dining reservation. However, we dealt with one Disney cast member named Chris who in particular astounded us with his knowledge of the parks and his tips were spot on. Chris greeted us just about every morning at the door and this person is a must before heading into the parks, designate 10-15 minutes out of your schedule to speak to him. He has so many tips be sure to take notes and make sure you ask him about theme park locations with \"stories\" he will let you know where to go. The rooms had all the neccessary amenities and plenty of room to move around and store luggage/ souvenirs. Our room was kept very clean by the maid staff and all maids we encountered were very friendly and courteous. One disadvantage to the rooms is the bathroom its very crampt with very little room to move around however there was more than adequete towels available. The resort has three bus stop locations around the resort area just be sure to give yourself plenty of time you will wait for buses. Some disadvantages to the bus system is Port Orleans services both resorts with the same bus so it can get very packed. The resort does offer a boat to the Downtown Disney area and this is a great alternative to the buses and is highly recommended. With the boat ensure you again have time to wait with boats docking every 20 minutes until about 4 or 5pm where they run every 10 minutes. Overall, this resort is great with everything you could need from a nice foodcourt, good restaurant variety, ample resort market shopping, a descent transportation system, and a world class staff.

The shop sells the usual disney apparrel, some general first aid such as tablets, creams and plasters etc, sweets and snacks and sun creams. The restaunt 'Boatwrights' serves delicious food but is a little on the expensive side. The Food Court is far more reasonable as you would expect and serves delicious food for breakfast lunch and dinner. The bar is good fun in the evenings as there's usually some form of entertainment for the whole family to get involved with. Just outside the main building is the main pool area called Ol Man Island.

The very warm whirl pool is also great especially later in the evening when you need to soak those aching muscles after a day at one of the parks. There are also several other 'quiet' pools if you'd prefer a bit of piece and quiet. Rooms are clean but quite basic and usually have 2 queen size beds and are all air conditioned with a free to use safe.

The resort cafeteria food was good, the only complaint was that we found that the staff really scrimped on the portions. Booking reservations for the sit down table service meal was challenging. Since the meal plan was included with the resort package, reservations filled up quickly. We had to alter park plans to coincide with the dining plans. The Coral Reef (Epcot), Liberty Tree (Disney), Tappan Edo (Epcot), Nine Dragons (Epcot), and Spirits of Aloha (Polynesian Resort) were all excellent.

The theming of Riverside is flawless and the grounds are absolutely stunning. Even though the hotel was filled to capacity during our stay, the grounds were still amazingly peaceful and it was so wonderful to come home here after a busy day in the parks. There was such an abundance of wildlife here, everywhere you looked, there were rabbits, squirrels, ducks, lizards and birds, I even saw a turtle (or tortoise, I never know the difference!) swimming in the river a couple of times!

I have to say, the front desk were very helpful about this. They didn\u2019t have a new room the day I asked, but were able to move us the next day. Our new room was in the Oak Manor building, it was a lovely location, less than five minutes walk from the main building, overlooking a lovely fountain and right beside a quiet pool, I was delighted with this room. The rooms themselves are nice, if not massively fancy. Our room had two queen beds, table with two chairs, locker, drawer unit with TV, fridge and coffee making facilities. There is a separate dressing area between the bedroom and the bathroom, which contains a hanging rail, two sinks, iron and hairdryer. The bathroom is pretty tiny with toilet and shower over the bath. I would think the rooms are a pretty tight fit for 4 or 5 people, but for the two of us, it was more than adequate. The twin sinks are great, it was so handy that both of us could get ready at the same time and I would imagine this is a Godsend if you had 4 people in the room. If I was being very picky about the room, I would say that I would prefer a full wardrobe rather than a hanging rail and also there was only one locker, rather than one each side of the bed, this meant that I had to drag over one of the chairs to act as a locker and rest my book on! But overall, the rooms are comfortable and nicely decorated. You don\u2019t tend to spend that much time in the room anyway, so they more than serve their purpose. The housekeeping was ok, again if I were being picky, I would say that there was a lot of dust on one of the shelves when we first went into the room, and the corners of the bathroom looked dusty. However, we were always left plenty of towels and toiletries. We never received a towel animal during our whole stay despite leaving a tip everyday! Maybe they didn\u2019t bother when they saw it was two adults in the room, but I\u2019m a kid at heart and would have liked a towel critter or two! This hotel has a lovely pool with a slide, but it can get pretty busy and it can be hard to get more than one lounger together at busy times. There was a nice (if overpriced) pool bar. We preferred to use the quiet pool beside our building, it was lovely and peaceful and suited us better as two adults without kids. However, there are no towels at the quiet pool, so you either have to take them from the room or get them from the main pool. There was a laundry beside our quiet pool, which meant we could do our laundry while sunbathing, very handy! This hotel has a sit down restaurant and a food court. We didn\u2019t try the restaurant as it seemed pretty overpriced and didn\u2019t look to have a particularly nice atmosphere (when I\u2019m paying $25 for an entr\u00e9e, I expect tablecloths!). We ate at the food court a few times as we had the quick service meal plan, it got seriously busy after 9am, I would really advise getting there between 8-9am as otherwise it was like a zoo! I wasn\u2019t keen on the breakfast choices, but then I\u2019m not a fan of cooked breakfast, we ended up using our snack credits to get pastries instead which were always nice and fresh. There was also cereal and yoghurt parfait for those wanting a lighter choice. The selection of food was the same every day, which was a shame, although the \u2018make your own pasta\u2019 was seriously tasty and you got a huge portion. I got shrimp in mine, and there was a huge amount of shrimp in it. There was also a lounge bar in the hotel, however we didn\u2019t go in to it as every night there was a very loud, irritating piano player and we didn\u2019t fancy it. He seemed to be a big hit with the kids, so this is probably a big plus if you have children, but certainly not our cup of tea. There is also a shop, which has a pretty good selection of Disney merchandise as well as snacks and some essentials you may have forgotten. We didn\u2019t use the bus transportation as we had our own car. In addition to the buses, there is also a boat service to Downtown Disney, which is lovely, but be prepared to wait at busy times. All of the buildings have a car park behind them, so if you do rent a car, you shouldn\u2019t be too far a walk from it. People talk about how huge Riverside is, but I walked the entire property and walking at a reasonable pace, no building should be more than 5 minutes walk from the main building. For joggers, there is a nice walking path along the river to the French Quarter, it is about a mile long I believe. Overall, we absolutely loved this hotel, it was so beautiful and peaceful, especially after the busyness of the parks. The staff were all lovely and very helpful. I would find it very hard to stay anywhere else on future trips to Orlando, I didn\u2019t want to leave!", "Date": "September 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harrogate, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201canother lovely holiday\u201d", "Author": "GwenU", "ReviewID": "UR40127289", "Content": "Just returned from a lovely stay at Port Orleans Riverside Resort, Its a large resort we were in Alligator Bayou Lodge 34, we got lost numberous times gettting to and from the lodge!! There are 3 small pools and laundry facilities shared between the lodges and one big main pool. There are 2 places to get food, we ate in the large caferteria type place, I had a burger one night but it was raw in the middle. Put me off of eating there again. Meals are pricey, a large size pizza was $16 and burger $10. We bought the re fillable mug option which is a good idea and we made good use of it. The weather was hot and humid and it rained for 2 days of our stay. Not sure if it was because of the wet weather and lots of grass but I got covered in bites but just on my legs. The rooms tend to be dark, the fridge which was standard in all rooms at port orleans was a big bonus, the air conditioning works well but tends to be noisy at night. There are 2 hand wash basins, and every day a fresh supply of soap and shampoo/conditioner and fresh towels. On arrival we had a towel animal on the bed but despite tiping the maid on a regular basis we didnt get any more towel animals. There is a safe in the wash area which is handy for passports etc., The bus service is good we were by west depot which is one of the first stops. We walked over to french quarter and had a nice meal there. The boat service to downtown disney is fun to do. The on site shop sells lots of disney goods and also milk, plasters and cereals, bread and pretty much most things you might want. We found the bell service to be good, we were given a map on check in to find our lodge but as we had stayed at Port Orleans before I knew bell hop was just outside the lobby and went and asked them to take us and our bags to our room and they did it with no problems and when we left we rung them about 10 mins before we needed them and they came promptly and then stored our luggage in the luggage hold until we departed. All the staff were helpful and friendly. And we are planning to go back there next year.

First time stay was at Coronado Springs in 07'. Prior to my travel I reviewed all the moderate resorts with a fine tooth comb, so I thought! Previewing all the month of July's reviews and high recommendations all the way across the board. So it was no contest to book at the RPO this time. Room was clean the first two days of stay only. There is some sort of linen shortage in Disney so you do not get your sheets changed every day nor do u get clean towels. Oh yes, did u know that ur towels might not be getting washed everyday, but rather hanged dried. They spray them with some disinfective and thats it!!! How disgusting and unsanitary is that!!! They actually put cards in ur room asking u too hang dry ur towels as well. OMG !! What is this world coming too? One day my 2 children and I wanted to swim in the main pool only to find out some child was extremly ill in it!!!! So they shut the pool down for only 1/2 day!!! What about completly emptying the pool and doing some serious disinfecting. There's only the SWINE FLU going around and god knows what else!!!!! Very unsanitary. Needless to say we went over to the French Quarter Pool to find that no child had been ill in that one. The service was aweful throughout the resort. There was a variety of food in the court, however I really cannot believe how it is served and handled!! You must stay close to the main bldgs or plan on long walks and getting lost. Arcadian, Magnolia and Oak were pretty close to everything. Ladies do not leave any jewerly items open and loose anywhere in your room. THEY WILL BE GONE!! Even the cheap stuff!! The management is terrible here. One thing that I have learned throughout Disney is that the employees are not what they use to be!!!! First of all at least 50% of employees do not speak or understand English!!! They are not knowledgable of anything. Nor are they trained well!!!! Its too bad Disney does not take better Pride in customer service relations these days but rather just hiring massive amounts of internationals. Although it was nice to have two resorts under our thumb at the same time (French Quarter and RPO) to use I would rather spend the extra $$$ to get treated better and my $$$ worth at a Delux Resort. Always ask as many questions as possible when u travel. Talk to people who u know that have stayed at the resort. Make sure it has everything u need and want for ur family. Do as much research on the place u want to stay at way before u leave so u have plenty of time to change ur mind!!! Especially if u are on the Dining Plan, which by the way I highly recommend to everyone traveling if it is available !!!!!! Yes I will return to the most Magical Place on Earth with my family, but I will not be staying at the RPO. P.S.

We had 2 zippie bags of toiletries to take home with us to remember our stay! The room was always clean upon arrival back from the park. We can say nothing negative about the resort. My husband had to be taken by ambulance for a ongoing medical issue and the manager came to our room and gave myself and 2 children cab vouchers to and from Celebration hospital and took great care of us. We were very greatful for the compassion and assistance during this time. The ducks in the morning were always a pleasant sight to see by our family as the kids loved to chase them around! The grounds were always neatly manicured and the cast there was extremely friendly and helpful. Even though breakfast at any time of the morning was a zoo, the staff did a teriffic job moving the lines quickly and we did not have too much difficulty finding a place to sit down. We would come back here and use one of our counter services for dinner as this resort had such a variety of food and what a great value. We were on the dining plan so it made it great. We also bought one resort mug that my husband used for his coffee in the morning and we took a bottled water as his beverage to the parks. I would defenetely recommend this resort to families and those on a honeymoon! This is the perfect resort for a wonderful disney stay.

We stayed in the Acadia House facing the parking lot, and all we had to do was turn a corner and we saw a beautiful view! I think it was actually a bonus to be facing away from everything, b/c we were never bothered by noise outside our room. The buses ran pretty regularly, the only time you really waited for a bit was to go to the Magic Kingdom...Most of the other parks you could just walk right on. You can take a ferry to Downtown Disney, and that was very relaxing and a nice break from crowded buses. The Boat Captains were really nice and would talk about the birds we passed or about the Treehouse Villas we passed as well. The Horsedrawn Carriage rides were very romantic as well!!! It's $35 for a 1/2 hr. I believe, but you get your moneys worth, and the horses were treated very respectfully and carefully. The food is pricey...But so is everything at Disney!!!! It's mostly 'down home' and Southern food...I had turkey and fixings one night, and though it was a little overpriced it was good.

We thought it was great. We have 3 children ages 11,8 and 6 and found that this was the only place Disney offers for a family of 5 that is not a \"Deluxe\" resort. The kids took turns on the small trundle bed, It was fine. After a long day at the park, they were too tired to care where they slept. Our room was very clean. The kids loved the main pool which had a fun water slide. There was also a small pool outside our building (17). We took the boat to downtown Disney for dinner one night. The food court was adequate and the sit down restaurant was quite good (only open for dinner). We rented a surey bike (they had boats too). OK the big question...the bus system. It is hard to know whether the buses in general are slow or just at Riverside. I would tend to think they are just slow everywhere. We stayed at the All Star in the past and it was worse. In the morning we always got on the bus and generally the buses run more frequently during an extra magic hours day. One day we left Animal Kingdom with a full bus and instead of going straight to the resort it went to Typhoon Lagoon. Not sure the point, you couldn't squeeze one more person on. One complaint I had was 24 hrs before our Southwest flight I went to the Concierge desk to have them print our boarding passes, I stood there for 30 min while they planned meals for those people who didn't do it advance. (The line moved so slow) And for those of you who fly Southwest you know the timing on printing the boarding passes is crucial. I told them they should have a separate window for air travel business and they didn't seem to care. In summary I would say for the approx $159 a night to stay here, it is a great deal. We paid more than that to stay at a chain hotel in PA to visit relatives. Also if you have a car, the parking at the park is free. We didn't need the car, the magical express worked fine.

We could not go back there again because our yougest was over that we could stay in one room. We were going to stay at another Deluxe hotel (Contmporary), however, discovered that we could stay at Port Orleans Riverside for $1000.00 less. I was a little leary about staying at Riverside after reading the reviews about the poor transportation to and from the park. I thought for a $1000.00 price difference, I could put up with the transportation. Since we were just on another vacation last month I thought, this would be a good deal. Everything I read about Port Orleans on Trip Advisor was correct. This is a beautiful resort. The room was fine for the 5 of us. Our two younger children took turns sleeping on the tundle bed. Which as others have mentioned is a mattress on a wooden frame. It was fun for them. I loved the double sinks. The refridgerator in the room was great. I will warn you about one thing. Everything I read about the transportation system at Riverside was true. We stayed in Alligator Bayou Lodge 27. Less than a 5 minute walk to the South Depot. After reading all of the reviews, I requested certain buildings near the main building and this bus depot. It is the first stop on the bus route. Every morning we arrived at the bus stop around 7:20 for extra morning hours. The bus stop was packed. Every day a good number of people had to stand on the bus. 3 of the days, there were too many people so they had to wait to get on the bus. We never went to another stop at Port Orleans because there was no room. On some days, they did stop at the French Quarter first too which limited space on the bus. Every time we left a park, the bus stop back was full. Again, people standing and being left to wait for another bus. We never stayed at a park till the end of the night. I read about how difficult it was to get back. I also heard that from 4 people through conversations on the bus. (All 4 said it took them almost 2 hours to get back from the parks at night.) We had dinner at Ohana's on night and watched the fireworks. We actually took a $12.00 taxi back to our hotel to avoid the bus. (Someone said they did this as well. That is where I got the idea.) People actually cheered on 6 different occassions when the bus pulled up to the stops at the parks when we were standing there. I, as do many other people, wonder why Riverside does not provide more buses being that the resort is so big. We are going back in 2 years again. We will not stay at Riverside only due to the fact that the transportation was inadequate for us. I will tell you that it is a great hotel. It is a great value.

The beds were okay, not too lumpy and not too hard, and I was able to fall asleep very fast after a long day at the park. The quick-service area was huge, seating was plenty, but the food was typical; burgers, pizza, sandwiches, salad, etc. I do want to note that their desserts are absoultely delicious, specifically the cheesecake! There were a couple minor things that I would like to note. When I got to the room, the refrigerator was broken, but maintenance came in while I was out and fixed it immediately. I even called the front desk and they said they would reimburse me for the food that got spoiled. Also, for those who aren't morning people, houskeeping wakes you up early in the morning to check if you want your room cleaned up. I even put a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the doorknob but they ignore it.

The Magical Express picked us up from the airport and dropped us off at the hotel. We had checked in online before we left for Florida so our check-in involved one minute at the desk to pick up our folder with our keys (which do triple-duty as Disney tickets and Dining Plan passes). We stayed in Parterre Place, which is about a two minute walk from the lobby and a three minute walk from the bus pick-up. The building was lovely and our room was clean. Housekeeping was good and actually decorated our room with mardi gras beads one night. They also left a birthday card from Mickey for my husband and made a towel Mickey-ears sculpture on the bed for our arrival! The only problem we had with the room was that although the a/c worked well, it made funny noises when it was on, so we had to turn it off at night and just run the room fan and the ceiling fan. Despite it being 100 degrees outside for most of our trip, this was completely satisfactory to us -- having the a/c on low during the day while we were gone was enough to keep it very cool all night. We only ate at the hotel twice during our stay. The food court create-your-own pasta station was good, and Boatwright's was fine. Both were overpriced as compared to normal life but about par for the course in terms of Disney. The gift shop attendants were very friendly and helpful (more helpful than the concierge in terms of hotel information), and we used the package service twice with no problems (if you buy things in the park, they deliver them to the hotel gift shop for pick up the next day so you don't have to lug them around). Our one disappointment was that we didn't reserve a carriage ride in advance. By the time we decided we wanted to do one, all the slots were taken until 9:30 at night and we had an early flight the next morning so we didn't get to ride. Magical Express was on time for our departure and we had no problems making our flight at the end of the trip. Bottom line: This hotel was completely acceptable.

We drove all night and checked in at midnight with 3 small kids. The buildings for the units are all a bit of a walk from the parking lot. As we unloaded our suitcases we looked for a luggage rack but none to be found. I went to the room and called the front desk and asked where they kept the luggage racks however the not so pleasant lady said we don't offer luggage racks but a luggage attendant will help you bring your luggage to the door. (that is if we could find one). As we continued to unpack and carry our luggage to the room we saw one of those luggage attendants and as he drove his little golf cart by, we asked for his help \"he said he is on his way to do something else and said it looks like we have it under control\". So after we managed to drag all 3 sleepy kids and luggage to the door \u2026.we noticed the disgusting trundle bed underneath one of the double size beds where I guess they expected our 3 year old to sleep. The sheets were discolored and nasty and the mattress laid low to the stinky carpet, the mattress itself was as thin as paper. I called the front desk to see if we could get a cot but she said we would have to move all of our stuff to another room because our room doesn't allow for a cot. Of course we decided against that due to the fact we have already broke a sweat bringing our stuff to this room. We pushed one bed against the wall and had all three kids sleep in one bed and my husband and I squeezed together in the other one. The refridgorater is certainly a plus to have in the room however it helps if it works. We loaded our fridge with $30.00 worth of food and the next morning it was all hot and the fridge over heated somehow. We tried to save our food by putting it back in the cooler we brought but when my husband went to get ice from the icemaker down the hall, it was broken. The front desk did send someone immediately to fix it. they said they had to replace the fridge however, after we bought more food to put in the fridge \u2026\u2026it broke again and now lost another $30.00 worth of food. SURPRISE\u2026SURPRISE! We also ate onsite at the hotel restaurant which was not bad. The attitudes of the people working there could have been more pleasant since we are in disney and the food cost a fortune. I would recommend going out to breakfast somewhere else or at least go to down town disney for breakfast. On a positive note the front desk did reimburse us for the food we lost. Other then that I wouldn't say that our time in this hotel was a positive experience and would certainly never come back. We have had better experiances staying in near by hotels.

We spent three nights at Port Orleans Riverside. I can't think of anything I didn't like about the property. For anyone considering going there, I will describe it: It has a large pool on a little island in the middle of the resort. You can walk across a pretty bridge to get to the lobby. We stayed at a place called Alligator Bayou, and it was located on a beautiful, lush, tropical-style setting with a bayou. Although there is one large pool on the island, there are smaller pools near the lodges. The dining area is large and set up like a food court. You have many choices for food. If you buy the refillable mug, you can get as many drinks as you want during the duration of your stay. The mug makes a nice souvenir to take home. We actually found that the food was better at the lodge than in the parks. The lobby and other main building areas are very attractive. There is a large paddle wheel at the back of the building, and people apparently rent paddle boats and bicycles there. The gift shop has a lot of Disney souvenir items, some of them reasonably priced. We liked this resort because it was quiet. We were actually able to sleep there. The room was very cute, with log beds and New Orleans bayou themed items. Service was good at the hotel, and the employees were very friendly and helpful. Bus service goes from several places, including by the lobby. It is probably better to get onto the bus at the lobby area, even though you can get on at a location closer to your room. The bus tends to fill up at the lobby area, so you will most likely have to stand when the bus gets to your bus stop.

I was very concerned based on reviews that I read prior to visiting. However, our family had an excellent experience at the POR. We found that location of their building at the hotel (the place is huge) had everything to do with the people being unhappy and that they were not disatisfied with service or the cleanliness as I have read in complaints. Our maid was on top of our rooms cleanliness throughout the morning and everyone I asked for help went out of their way. The rooms are no smaller than some rooms I have stayed in some luxury hotels chains. The trundles are smaller and probably would not accomodate any taller than 5' comfortably, so they are really made for kids. With three kids, ages 10,6 and 2, feeding everyone can be a chore. The food court had a variety of the things kids like and were rarely crowded at lunch or early evening. Breakfast is very crowded. The mark up on food was not that bad, you can get a large pepperoni pizza for just under $16 that can feed two adults and two younger children easily. If you are staying for more than a couple days and intend to eat at the property at least once a day, get the refillable mug. I never had a complaint about anything I had to eat but you have to remember that it is a food court, not a gourmet restaurant! They also have the Disney channel playing in the food court and a lego table with crayons and pictures to color that are a nice distraction so that mom and dad can eat!! All my interactions with cashiers and counter help was very positive. Transportation was efficient and each morning Disney had somone at the South Depot letting you know about how much longer your wait would be. Be prepared for long waits to return from the parks to this hotel at rush times. It is so huge that it always had the longest lines for buses, especially after fireworks. The pool was a blast for the kids. The water slide is a bonus! If you are honeymooners or don't want to be bothered by noise, use one of the quiet pools on the grounds, they are MUCH less crowded. The playground for kids is practically brand new. If you use the Airline Check In, be sure that you check the information that is delivered to your room ahead of time!!!!!

Go to the car rental sites and become a member of their rental clubs, this will help you to go to their \"express\" line and save time. 4) Time your meal times for off peak hours. 7-8am breakfast, 11 am lunch 4-5pm dinner this will help to avoid the crowds 5) Rainforest cafe in downtown Disney is popular. Join the Safari Club and get priority seating and a discount on dining 6) Don't get the meal plan, you are spending 10-15% more on food and you won't eat it all. Go to the grocery store for food items and eat breakfast in your room. 7) If you have young children, go to the parks early and leave by 11, go back to the resort and go to the pool. Eat an early dinner and go back to the park when everyone else is leaving or eating around 4. These are just some quick tips. Riverside has nice landscaping and nice clean rooms and in my opinion is a better value than the Disney luxury resorts.

A vacation at Port Orleans Riverside is most definitely worth the extra couple hundred dollars you will spend compared to staying here and staying at one of the value-priced resorts (see my previous review on one of the All-Star resorts) and along that same vein, a better value and bang for your buck \u2013 especially in this economy - than staying at one of the high priced luxury resorts. If you have no need to keep up with the Joneses back home, the Disney moderate resorts are THE best value at Walt Disney World. Before I left for my trip, I opted for the advance online check-in tool now being offered by Disney Destinations, the Disney travel company I booked my vacation through. This entails logging in and completing a form with my room preferences, and I was under the notion that I would breeze into the hotel lobby and have room key in hand faster than the Fairy Godmother can turn Cinderella\u2019s mice into men. Not. We arrived at the Port Orleans Riverside at around 7:00 in the evening, and the line for regular check-in was about ten families deep, with only two clerks to check them in. No problem (so I thought) because I did the online check-in from home and the designated line for online check-in had no line, but it did have one family at the counter. So I stepped up to the online check-in area and waited my turn. And waited, and waited, \u2026 for a good 15 minutes before my sister in law offered to stand in line for me at the regular check-in since the Magical Express airport bus had just pulled up with a full load. It turned out that the people in front of me had a credit card issue or something because they had to speak to someone over the clerk\u2019s phone several times. Needless to say they took a very long time to get checked in but the worst part was that the clerk didn\u2019t have the courtesy to direct me to the other line, or at least let me know she would be a while \u2013 a LONG while. When I finally made it to the counter about 20 minutes later, I asked the clerk what was the purpose of having express check-in if it was not speedy or efficient. She told me that the people in front of me were pulled from the regular line and had she known they would have problems she would not have allowed them in the express line. Then she handed me my packet with our park hoppers which also serve as room keys, showed me on a map where my room was located and handed me some extra \u201ccelebration\u201d buttons to appease me. Everything I asked for on the online check-in form was in order so I thanked her and went along my merry way. We were on a ground floor room in building 17 in Alligator Bayou and on a corner, so we only had neighbors on one side. Building 17 is about a 6-8 minute walk to the bus transportation via the parking lot as well as the main building where the lobby, food court, and gift shop is located. On our morning walks over to the food court we meandered along the designated pathways and were greeted by bunny rabbits and ducks along way. From our building it was about a 5 minute walk. On one rainy afternoon, and on the day we had extra magical hours (until 2 AM) at the Magic Kingdom we drove to building 15 and parked there because it is only steps from the bus transportation, and since we had a 4 year old we knew she would be zonked out by night\u2019s end. (For some reason, a 40 pound child seems to weigh 100 pounds when she is sleeping.) My next trip there I will ask for a room in Building 15 because it is so convenient to everything but most importantly, transportation. The rooms are decorated in a rustic back woods d\u00e9cor which is casual and relaxing. I like that the bathroom area has a privacy curtain and TWO sinks. The shower/tub is average, but it does have a sitting bench for people who are bathing small children, or for elderly to sit on. The room can actually sleep five people because underneath one of the queen beds is a trundle bed, just the right size for a child. My 8 year old niece slept there and she said it was like camping. There is also a refrigerator which will help you save money if you take bottled waters (we did) and other refreshments. We ate at least one meal or snack at the food court each day and all of the food is excellent \u2013 the breakfast grits are among the best I\u2019ve had. Dinner of pasta and salads along with Mickey shaped crispy treats for two adult women and three children on our first night there ran around $60. Adults who are not heavy eaters can opt for a child\u2019s meal to save money as well. Also, for $12.99 you can buy a souvenir cup and refill it as much as you like for your entire stay. I am a heavy coffee drinker and I LOVE Disney coffee so I got my money\u2019s worth from the cup however, the room does have a small coffee maker if you don\u2019t feel like making the trek to the food court. One of my favorite things to do at any Disney resort is to walk to the food court at 6:00 AM before the rest of the world wakes up, and to get my coffee and sip it alone on the terrace as I watch the joggers and the landscapers, all while taking in the general splendor of where I am. We had so much fun in the WDW parks that we did not take time to use the resort\u2019s bicycle rentals, carriage rides or even the swimming pools, but they looked inviting. I did do laundry one morning and the laundry facilities were clean and tidy. My only issue was with some inconsiderate guest who opened a dryer I was using thinking it was hers, but she didn\u2019t bother to restart it, so I fell behind by about 30 minutes. Finally, on our last day we boarded the river taxi from Port Orleans over to Downtown Disney. The ride alone was an adventure in itself, making just one stop to pick up guests from the French Quarter section of Port Orleans Resort. The boat captain handed out pirate hats at random to the little kids. When you get to Downtown Disney, take the kids over to World of Disney where the Fairy Godmothers will sprinkle you with fairy dust as you make a wish \u2013 I wished that I could come back to Walt Disney World, and real soon!", "Date": "July 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "us", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!

You save the money by not needing a car to get around (other hotels have this service also, but I find that for DisneyWorld the park shuttles are convenient and frequent). The rooms were laid out well and it was nice that there was a curtain to separate the sinks/bathroom from the rest of the room. This meant that I was not forced to change in the bathroom if my daughters were awake or around. The bathroom was not large, but a decent size for a hotel. The only possible issue we had was the room cleaning. The room was clean, but we did not get coffee packets dropped off every day.

Ever tried to store duffel bags on top of the TV wall unit? Don't even think about it: upon retrieval the bags were coated with dust bunnies. Nobody ever dusts up there ?!?! Fortunately, that was the only negative aspect to our stay. The wait for the shuttle buses was not that bad. Buses were packed coming back to the hotel at peak times but what could one expect? Some of the bus drivers did not speak English well or know anything about the resort. I saw one guest ask for directions at night to get back to his accommodations and the driver just shrugged his shoulders. The man and his tiny daughter walked off in what I realized the next day was the wrong direction, toward the vast pitch-black open spaces. The food was good (beer and wine a rip-off, but I expected that). The \"better\" restaurant was actually more limiting for the kids and hence just a hassle. I ordered a jambalaya that tasted more tired than I was. Abita ales were the only real plus to the sit-down restaurant. The pool on \"Ol'Man Island\" was great fun; however, the lifeguards should be more stringent about enforcing safety rules.

But don't expect anything special in the rooms. We benefited from the \"Extra Magic Hours\" offered to resort guests, and this made it worthwhile. The sheer magnitude of this place amazed me. The buildings are all 2-story, so this place is sprawling, with four different bus stops, 6? pools, and a river running through the middle. It takes a LONG time to walk from just about anywhere. I don't know if this is possible, but if you can look at a map before hand and request something near the main building, do it. Rooms: Clean Motel 6. Nothing more. Wall A/C units are annoying to control, but it provides what you generally need at a place like this: Two clean beds and a working bathroom. Not too many people head to Disney World for the hotels last I checked. I'd stay here again based on that premise alone. Facilities: You could easily spend a day or two just enjoying the fun at the hotel. There are several pools (which can get crowded, we were there in high season), a fun (but expensive) arcade, cane pole fishing, and rental boats. We took advantage of all of these and if you need a relaxing day in the middle of your busy vacation, you can save a few bucks and do this. Food: Like all Disney food, they offer a mix of pizzas, sandwiches, and other basic American fare. I personally despise Disney food, although the kids were fine with it. If you're there for more than 3 days and plan on eating on site a couple meals a day, get the $13 mug for free refills. It pays for itself eventually. Go to Downtown Disney for real food. They do offer healthy choices for the kids, which i appreciated. We did not try the on-site, nicer restaurant. Transportation: I think this is a fundamental problem right now. The buses are pretty frequent, but are always packed and it can take a long time to get where you want to be. If you're going to EPCOT, you will have no problems. Otherwise it was tough. Rant: There are people in this world that are handicapped, and Disney provides special consideration for them. I saw people that genuinely needed these services and used them. This I have no problem with; I can wait an extra 5 minutes for them to board a bus. I could be wrong, but there seemed to be more than a few people that stretched the definition of \"handicapped\" in order to get around the park easier. Example: Overweight 50+ year old with a family of 6 hanging along side. So the 6 people get to pretty much go to the front of every line. I hate feeling this way, because I just don't know, but there were people that just didn't seem like they needed the little scooters, they were just lazy. Some I have no doubt needed them. Either way, it slows your day down, rent a car if you can. Complaint: This is probably just bad luck, but we took the free boat down the river to/from Downtown Disney, and had severe problems. They shut these down twice out of 3 times we used it due to weather, in the middle of the trip. One time we were probably 5 minutes away, and the guy just stopped at Saratoga and told us to get off. The end. No help for about 25 people. It was a terrible way to handle people. So we trek through rain and lightning with two kids to a mosquito filled bus stop (no safer than being on the water, yet I digress). There a bus arrives with an angry driver who wasn't offering any help. We go to another hotel, then back to Downtown Disney, and finally to Riverside. It took over an hour and a half. I certainly appreciate safety concerns, but if you're going to drop people off like that, HELP THEM. The other time they stopped the boat at least at Port Orleans French Quarter, where it was easy to get back. But that time it was due to \"high wind.\" The boat wasn't even rocking. It was ridiculous. Bottom Line: Good value, nice facilities. Nothing luxury at all. Avoid the boat to Downtown if there is any weather at all in the area; if it's good weather USE IT. I would recommend renting a car if you can afford it.

Everything is always freshly landscaped and manicured. There are several pools throughout the grounds. The central pool has a waterfall and slide for kids, along with a hot tub and a pool bar for adults. There is a play ground behind the pool area. The food is great, too. Even the food court has far better food than most hotels in this price range. The resort is divided into 2 different sections that have totally different looks. I do not care for Alligator Bayou, but if you have small kids you may like it. The outside of that area looks like country type cottages in the woods. Even the landscaping is different on that side of the resort. The rooms are done in furniture that looks like it was made from tree logs (think rustic log cabin type furniture). Magnolia Bend, however, is gorgeous. It is made to look like sprawling mansions in a southern area. There are little gardens that are perfect for pictures. There are magnolia trees everywhere, too. Totally romantic and relaxing if that's what you're looking for! The rooms are different inside on this area of the resort, too. They look like old fashion mansion style with very traditional furniture and arrangements. All rooms have double pedestal sinks so it's convenient for 2 or more people. The resort has an amazing boat ride that you can take to go to the French Quarter (the other Port Orleans resort) or to Downtown Disney. The boat ride is about 15 minutes and again, is totally amazing! You pass along through the Treetop villas and the golf course on the way to Downtown Disney. If you're going to a park, the buses area great. You never have to wait more than 10 minutes (maximum) and usually get right on a bus. Disney's buses do not stop at any other resorts or any other stops. They have buses that go to every park so you never get stuck waiting to drop people off like you do on all other non-Disney resorts. You are at whatever park you're going to in less than 10 minutes ALL THE TIME! Same goes for leaving the parks. Buses are constantly coming to pick you up and they go straight back to your hotel. When you stay at another hotel outside disney, you often wait for 30 minutes (or more) and then you have to stop at other hotels and/or other parks making your ride back to the hotel very long! At this (and probably all disney resorts) you do not need a car for anything. We park in the parking lot and don't even go to the car until we are leaving and we have never been inconvenienced in any way from the resort transportation, which makes a HUGE difference if you are traveling with children! It really takes a lot if stress out of the issues that can arise on vacation. Also, the resort has paddle boats, small motor boats and larger party boats for very reasonable renting prices. They have an arcade and a general store that sells anything you need. There are bike rentals and buggy rentals. At night they have a horse drawn carriage for a great price. The resort has a beautiful walking/running track that is very peaceful at any time of the day. Also, there is lots of wildlife here. We've seen tons of rabbits, otters, hummingbirds and may others. Even the Disney rep that I made reservations with in Tampa said this is his favorite Disney hotel! The resort grounds are luxury all they way with the exception of the room decor. I say that because the inside of the rooms don't look like a Hyatt, though they are immaculate and comfortable.

Tip: Pay CLOSE attention to which bus stop you board the bus that is near your room so you remember where to get off when returning. The busses were over crowded and we always had to stand up which was difficult. THis hotel is good for Adults and Teenagers because it was not decorated or geared for serving small children.

Upon check-in we were put in bldg 36. Very far from the main blg, which I had requested we be close to, so I was offered a room in bldg 14 starting the next day if we wanted to change rooms, which I accepted. The dining plan was very convenient and we were more than satisfied with the size and cleanliness of the room. The trundle bed was fine for my 9 yr old twins but too small for my 13 yr old. On the days we got up early to get to the parks at opening the food court was not very crowded at all (between 7:30-8) On the mornings that we slept in and tried to eat around 9ish the food court was extremely crowded. The buses ran fairly regularly but got very crowded in the evenings. Tips: We made ADR's for the Crystal Palace in MK for 8am. We were able to get in to the park before opening walking down a virtually empty main street which made for great pics of the castle with no crowds and finish brkfst (which was fantastic) before the park opened, so we were able to be first in line at the rope drop to get over to splash mntn and thunder mntn. Because of being there early we were able to do all major rides with no more than a 20 min wait and were done by 2pm. At hollywood studios we got there at opening and I sent my husband and the 3boys to rock n rollercoaster while I went to get fast passes for toy story then was able to meet them as they came off the ride and we all got on tower of terror with only a 20 min wait. We ate lunch at 50s prime time-woiuld not recommend it really was not very good. Epcot was the most crowded and had we not been there at opening we probably would not have gotten on soarin. We got fast passes for mission space and had to get in the single rider line and ride separately for test track. Animal Kingdom we went to on the afternoon that we arrived. We got to AK around 2pm and found it to be very manageable crowd wise. We got on all rides including Everest with only a 20 min wait and no fastpasses needed. We also ate at at Tusker house which was fantastic! We are not adventerous eaters and I really was apprehensive but needed to use a sit down meal credit and I was more than pleasantly surprised. Actually on our last day we decided to go back. I tried to get ADR's at the concierge desk at the resort only to be told there was nothing available and so upon getting to the park we walked up to the restaurant at 5:10 to try our luck and were able to be seated with a 25 min wait. which was fine with us. I really was very satisfied with the resort the only complaint was that the pool water was very warm and not at all refreshing in the 100 degree heat but I think that had more to do with mother nature and all the hot bodies in the water than with the resort so I would definately recommend POR to families looking for a place to stay. I have to stay that I was shocked at how expensive everything was. Tshirts ranging from 20-30 dollars, baseball caps were $20, sweat shirts $40-$50. The small sized stuffed animals were $13-15! AT one point I needed to get medical attention for my 13yr old, We had used Magical Express (worked great) so we had no car, I went to the concierge desk and they were able to call a walk-in clinic that picks-up and then brings you back (free of charge) we only had to pay our co-pay and they had a pharmacy on site for medications.

No surprises based on online research and reviews. We do recommend that anyone planning to stay here visit www.portorleans.org for valuable information. Our stay was for the seven nights and we flew into Orlando. We chose to use resort transportation and purchase the Quick Service Dining plan. We are a family of four with two children. Our room was in the rustic Alligator Bayou section at Building 15. We followed online advice to request this building location with a second floor, outside corner room. As recommended, the second floor room was quiet and the extra set of windows in the outside corner room did make the room brighter and less \u201ccave-like.\u201d Buildings 14 & 15 are close to the main complex (lobby, restaurant, food court, store, arcade, baggage station, etc.), main bus station (South - Blue Bayou & River Delta), and water taxi dock (Riverside Levee). The convenience of this room location was great! The close proximity was really appreciated during stormy weather and you will have the shortest wait times at the South bus station; especially during peak hours. FYI \u2013 be sure to use the path between the bus platforms to shortcut your walk to buildings 14 & 15. Heed online comments that rooms located closer to the main complex had more wear-n-tear than rooms further away. Our first night was in Building 39, as our room request was not honored at check-in. This building and room was in much better condition than the room we moved to, but the walk to the main building was a long trek. For us, convenience was of higher importance than condition. Room size is not spacious, but was comfortable enough with two large suitcases, four backpacks, and three carry-on bags scattered about. However, it may be too cozy for four adults or a family of five. Housekeeping was adequate, but we did need to request that the second room be vacuumed at check-in. As always, we travel with disinfectant wipes to quickly go over the room upon returning each day. This practice tends to make the place feel cleaner. We also wear flip-flops in the room. Daily tipping kept us well stocked with extra towels and toiletries. We also chose this resort because of good reviews for its food court. As expected, the selection was fine and meals were mostly good. Actually, it was better than most over-the-counter meals at the attractions. During peak times the lines moved quickly and we always found a table. We agree that the pasta bar and warm cinnamon rolls are a very good choice. The make-your-own salads were a favorite for my wife. The roast beef was usually overdone. The only drawback at the resort is the water taxi transportation to Downtown Disney (DD), as the wait is quite long during dinner hours. Also, the boats stay docked during bad weather and you are rerouted to the bus service. We got delayed going to and leaving DD during thunderstorms. Disney does react to these situations by dispatching additional buses, but the wait can be quite long. We never regretted hauling around umbrellas and rain jackets in our backpacks. Overall, this Walt Disney World (WDW) resort is pleasant and relaxing. The setting and buildings are charming. The grounds are picturesque and well kept. We found the room quaint and adequate for the price of our discounted package. The staff members were friendly and courteous. We felt welcomed and were treated respectfully. In fact, the staff made our stay more enjoyable due to their conduct. We would return for another stay at this resort. Additional Notes: The best surprise was the WDW Water Parks (Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon). Highly enjoyable! Purchase the Water Park & More Option to visit both for less cost. Disney Quest was a huge disappointment. We are glad that we did not pay admission for this attraction (included in the option price above) Buyers beware of the Quick Service Dining (QSD) plan. Do the math. You must average about $11.50 per meal and $3.50 per snack to BREAK EVEN. This price point is above most QSD meals with drinks or QSD snacks. The 20% discount comes into play if you normally eat dessert with a heavy lunch and dinner each day. We overindulged ourselves to use up credits and meet price points and we still had 14 unused snacks remaining. A quick trip to Goofy\u2019s Candy Company at Downtown Disney solved that problem. QSD Tips: The best WDW QSD meals/deals are at Wolfgang Puck Express, DD Market Place. Do not estimate the cost of meals based on Disneyland, as WDW food costs less. Creative use of the QSD plan (i.e., use snack credit for breakfast croissants, muffins, etc. and resort mug for hot drinks) and splitting large portion meals, allowed us to stretch the seven night QSD plan for all meals, snacks, and drinks for the entire stay (eight full days). The bottom line cost for food was $105 per day for our family of four. The Disney Magical Express and resort bus service were both efficient and convenient. We had no ground transportation costs. Baggage services were also good. Since we arrived in the early morning hours, it was nice to check our carry-on baggage at the resort then head off to the attractions for the day. Airline check-in at the resort is easy, but pay baggage fees beforehand.

Much to our surprise, I called at 11am and our room was ready. We were in Alligator Bayou, building 18. The location of this building was great. We were close to the dining hall as well as Ol' Man Island, the main pool. There was a small \"quiet\" pool located right outside of our room, but we chose to go to the main pool instead. The room itself was nothing special. The rooms were definitely dated, but clean. They are not big enough for a party of 5. We did notice a few critters in the room, but when you are surrounded by that many trees and bushes, what can you expect. The trundle bed was a joke. It was basically a small mattress on the floor. It was located right next to our door, so we had a hard time going in and out if the bed was out. My husband ended up sleeping on the trundle bed because my kids were scared to sleep so close to the door (not to mention the fact that they were scared that \"critters\" would crawl on them). The bathroom was very small, barely enough room to move from the toilet to the shower. One good thing was the double sinks, that was a great thing considering there were 5 people in the room. Mousekeeping was ok, but could have been better. The food in Boatwrights as well as in Riverside Mill was very good, no complaints there. There were plenty of options for everyone in Riverside Mill, and you can't go wrong with Disney's Dining Plan. The lines did tend to get very long at certain times during the day. POR is an extremely large resort. In my opinion, it is just too large. We stayed at the Wilderness Lodge several times before and I don't have a single complain about that resort.

I had stayed with family at POFQ for Christmas 2007 and loved it. This time I wanted to try POR. Overall, I had a very nice stay. Here are some specifics: Magical Express - The bus shared a route with BC, YC, and BWI. (No one on the bus went to BWI though!) I was at the resort about 70 minutes after landing. The resort airline check-in was quite convenient. I never saw a lot of people there. The return route made stops at POFQ, OKW, and SSR. It took about 30 minutes for those stops before we were on the way to the airport. Online check-in - The sign at the front of the registration desk has an arrow pointing to the right. I followed it and had to ask at the regular check-in where I was supposed to go. The desks were at the far end of the lobby (the bottom of the U shape). One other family was checking in, and another cast member was available to help me. I had made three requests upon making my reservation - near the main building, Magnolia Bend, and top floor. The first most important one was not granted. The room assigned to me was on the back corner of Parterre Place facing a parking lot. I asked about a different location, and after a few minutes, I was assigned room 9717 in Parterre Place. I had ordered a case of water, which the cast member got for me. She had it sent to my room, since my hands were full. Overall, online check-in was easy and quick. The room - It took me 5 minutes to walk from the main building. The room itself showed a little wear, but it is a hotel room! It's not going to be absolutely perfect. My mousekeeper had left me a towel Mickey head on one of the beds. (The next day, I had more towel creations.) I had a view of a quiet pool in the distance. I am guessing the room was classed \"water view\" because of it, so I suppose I received an upgrade as I paid for a standard room. Transportation - I really have no problems with the transportation system. I always use the busses to travel around the parks and I love the boat to Downtown Disney. A few times I had just missed a bus so I had to wait 15 min or so for the next one, but Disney does say that busses run every 20 minutes. Sometimes you're lucky, and sometimes not. One night I did have to wait for a third boat to DD, as there was a long line of people waiting. It's free and a relaxing ride, so I didn't mind. The bus depots were a long walk from my room. It took 5+ minutes to get to the South Depot, and it took 7+ to get to the East Depot. I usually went to the South Depot. Sometimes the busses stopped there first, and other times they stopped first at the West Depot. I'm sure there is a logic to it, but I stopped trying to figure it out. Riverside Mill - I usually eat breakfast in the room, but this trip I splurged. I had something in the food court most days. There were very few people up as early as I was (usually between 6:30-7:15). I never had to wait in line and I never had trouble finding a table. I only ate lunch there once.

Though we assumed we'd be placed in Magnolia Bend (due to our family size), we were thrilled to be assigned to the more rustic and lush Alligator Bayou. The buildings in the mansion section were GORGEOUS, but we just preferred the relaxed feeling of the lodge-style accomodations a little more. All those green ferns and plants were so welcoming to a Canadian family who departed Toronto in the midst of a deep freeze.

How nice to have the choice of 2 feature pools! - the buses.....we didn't wait more than 10 minutes for a bus from this resort, and in most cases, it was 5 or less. We were extremely satisfied with Disney transportation!!! The resort is very big and there's a lot of walking, but honestly, that didn't bother us at all.

We made our table service meal reservations 90 days prior to arrival as per the new WDW policy, but couldn't get all the restaurants and times we wanted. Secondly, with the table service meal, the gratuities and appetizers are no longer included. If I would have known these changes prior to booking, I would have chosen the Quick Service Dinning Plan. On the plus side, the rooms were in reasonable walking distance to the bus stop and main lobby. The buses, boats and other transportation had reasonable wait times. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We took advantage on the extra early and late hours at the theme parks for guests. There was very good family (kids) entertainment in the River Roost Lounge in the evenings.

Check-in was very quick and smoothe and the clerk was helpful. Stayed in 36 Alligator Bayou. Quite a long way from the lobby but with a very pleasant pool nearby. Be warned that the pools get very busy late afternoon as everyone returns from the parks. Room was fairly dark, even with the blinds open, and we found we had to put the lights on in the day (if you opened the blinds people stared in as they walked past). It would have been nice to have some chairs on the verandah to sit on. Also the air conditioning was very noisy so the overhead fan was a big help. As stated in previous reviews room was 'tidied' every day rather than cleaned and I was disappointed to find stains on the comforter on Day 1 that were still there on Day 17. We weren't lucky enough to get any towel animals - despite tipping generously. Grounds were beautiful and well maintained. The boat ride to Downtown Disney is a must-do - the Captain of the boat will give a very informative commentary, pointing out places of interest on the way - although once you've heard it a few times it can get a little boring. Ate at the food court a few times. Food was ok and quite reasonably priced but a little like a school cafeteria. We did enjoy the pasta station - very generous portions and very tasty. One annoying thing - we saw many people with refillable mugs that had quite obviously not been bought at the resort, (some were even from Sea World and Universal) filling them for free at the beverage station in full view of the staff, who seemed to turn a blind eye. This is something that needs to be addressed!! The main pool was pleasant, with very attentive lifeguards and my son loved the slide (we saw a couple of occasions where the lifeguards jumped in without a moment's hesitation to assist a child in trouble, even before their parents knew there was a problem). However we were disappointed to find the pool closed on our last day for cleaning - with no prior warning. When we asked the pool staff when it would re-open they were a little vague and evasive?? Overall I would recommend this hotel. This was our first stay on Disney property - we have stayed in villas and other hotels in the past and I think we prefer the freedom of a villa. We didn't use the Disney transportation as we hired a car. The buses did seem to run very regularly and we never saw more than a handful of people waiting.

For the first time, I was able to afford to take my family there on a very short one night getaway. Whereas 95% of my stay was extremely enjoyable, the 5% was enough to make me decide to write a letter to Walt Disney World's VP of Resort Operations. First, the good. The Hotel is owned by and located at Walt Disney World. This means that as a guest, you are entitled to complete, unrestricted use of Disney World's phenomenal transportation center, access to extra hours at various parks at various times, and of course, it's Disney! Our room had a rustic flair, and on the surface seemed to be extraordinarily clean and inviting. The themed decor was beautifully simple, and there was plenty of room to store quite a bit of personal belongings for extended periods of time. Port Orleans - Riverside is the ONLY resort in the Moderate or Value categories that accept 5 persons. Regrettably, it didn't take too long to find out where WDW Co., was skimping on cash. Sure, these are tough times for all, but there are some certain hotel no-nos that Disney should be setting an example for - especially when you spend on average about $100 per night more for a room just because of where it is. First of all, I can understand using the absolute cheapest toilet paper in the theme parks, but in a NICE hotel, they should consider stepping up at least one grade level of paper. Disney also chooses to use lesser grades of blankets and coverings. None of that soft under cover at THIS $200 hotel. Next, there was a fruit loop under the bed. Ok - no big deal. Hard to vacuum under there. The last straw is perhaps the most unforgivable. In every hotel I have ever stayed at, paper cups (or in this case, some sort of paper/styrofoam/plastic hybrid) are individually wrapped in plastic to ensure their sanitation. Not so at cheap-skate Disney. They just plop however many cups they need to for the next check in. The problem is, they don't throw away the cups from a previous guest. This can cause MEGA problems. Family of four stays in room, everyone drinks from their various cups and stacks them nice and neat on the counter. Guest checks out. Housekeeping sees cups nicely stacked and assumes they are not used. Next guest unwittingly uses same cups. How would I know this? When I separated my cups, there was grape juice all over one of the stacked cups. Again, unforgivable. Other than that, I loved my stay. I hope you do, too. Just remember to call Housekeeping and ask for fresh cups when you check in. Maybe someday they'll realize that 2 cents per cup is worth spending for sanitation.", "Date": "May 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "maryville, mo", "Title": "\u201cGood value Disney resort with beautiful grounds\u201d", "Author": "arkansanbelle", "ReviewID": "UR31042044", "Content": "My family of four stayed at Port Orleans last summer (we have previously stayed Disney at Boardwalk, BeachClub, and Animal Kingdom Lodge).

They even sent a little gift to our room to apologize...very nice gesture. Mistakes will happen, but they way you handle it is what really matters. These women & men were top-notch! Honestly, we were a little worried when we heard how Disney was cutting back staff, but we were still impressed with the level of service. 3) Food on the property, and all over Disney, was awesome. We were on the dining plan and found it to be beneficial. Probably wouldn't have been as thrilled if we had to actually pay the listed prices (which are outrageous), but we milked the dining plan for all it was worth! Filet mignon every night LOL. We dined at Jiko (killer!), The Wave (best in Disney, in my humble opinion), Boatwrights, Tony's, and the Sci-Fi Diner. We had great counter-service at Flame Tree in Animal Kingdom. BEST BBQ on the planet! The biggest downside to the dining plan is there are NO substitutions. We don't usually like to eat a big dessert after lunch, so that part was a waste. Would have been nice to have an appetizer instead, or to be able to pick up something else later. 4) The boat to Downtown Disney is a must-do. So relaxing & serene. Can't comment on other Disney transportation svcs, except that it seems to run pretty consistently. We had a rental car since we also had tickets to Universal Studios....which, btw, was fantastic. The attractions are far better than the Disney Parks if you are with a group of adults/teens....highly recommend. 5) Cirque du Soliel. You simply have to experience this. Now for the minuses...and none were bad enough to keep us from coming back! 1) Mousekeeping is hit or miss. Don't expect to be wowed. I overheard other guests saying the same. Weird, b/c Disney seems to really set the bar for service. The first couple days we left healthy tips, hoping things would improve, but sadly, they did not. On a bright note...no tropical bugs surprised us, and the maids respect the do-not-disturb signs (probably b/c they aren't in a hurry to clean, anyway!) 2) Toilet flushing! These are some MEGA flushes, and you WILL hear it through the walls & the ceilings. It woke us up a few times, but it still beats screaming kids. 3) Room size. We knew what to expect ahead of time & the pictures are very accurate. This room was fine for the two of us, but I don't know how larger parties would manage. Also privacy could be an issue if you're that type of guy/gal. Overall, I would probably stay here again if the price was right. TIPS for those traveling without kids, or who want to avoid throngs: 1) Ask about non-peak times at restaurants 2) If you're gonna do the Magic Kingdom, wait until the Extra Magic EVENINGS, or on an overcast/drizzly day. Parents scrambled out of the parks at the first drop of rain, and also at night after the fireworks show, which was lovely for us! 3) Epcot is great for boozing, gluttony & peacful strolls through lush greenery if you're into that sort of thing..and is the least favorite park for many kids! Wink wink.... 4) Animal Kingdom is great for a day in the shade. Seems to be 10 degrees cooler. 5) Not many (any?) baby attractions at Hollywood Studios, so this tends to be an older crowd. 6) The Boardwalk Hotel area has nightclubs, a sports club and a piano bar...all kid-free!!! (At night, anyway). 7) RENT A CAR!!! Totally worth the extra expense. Nothing beats the freedom of traveling when you darn well feel like it....and without other people's noisy little ones. :-)", "Date": "May 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "River Falls, WI", "Title": "\u201cbest value in disney\u201d", "Author": "WIFamily", "ReviewID": "UR29860037", "Content": "Our family of five just returned from a week's stay at Riverside. It was awesome! We looked at some of the other properties while there and were glad we picked Riverside. Compared to other resorts it was much more peaceful and private even though it is huge and sprawling. Bus system works almost flawlessly. We stayed in bldg 14 which I would recommend. We were three minutes from the restaurants, bus stop and two pools. The main pool is nice but crowded, so we really appreciated the others pools scattered throughout the property. Quick service restaurant is good for the cafeteria it is. The sit down restaurant, Boatwright's is nothing special at all. If possible make reservations at Boma, an African buffet at Animal Kingdom Lodge--it is one of the best meals out there for families--plus kids get to see giraffes, zebras and more right outside the window. All in all, Riverside is good value. Because it is centrally localled it is never more than a 15 minutes bus ride to Epcot, Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom or Hollywood Studios. There is nice boat shuttle down the river to Downtown Disney where kids will love a huge Lego store and big shop with all the Disney stuff available in wide variety. Rooms are small but bearable. We had two adults and three kids (11, 9 and 8) and the trundle bed works great. Plus with the curtain area toward the bathroom, you can close the curtain and read while the kids fall asleep (which won't take long as they will be very tired).

Had originally wanted the French Quarter but we ended up going to Riverside and happy we did. The hotel grounds are quiet and serene. We've stayed at other Disney hotels including Pop Century and the Wilderness Lodge, but definitely enjoyed the Riverside just as well, if not more, than those hotels. The evening carriage rides were very charming, and our room (in Magnolia Bend area) was very nice and really close to the main lobby (less than a 5 minute walk). We did have to wait for the bus on more than one occasion, but nothing too excessive. One oops that we made was getting off the bus at the French Quarter stop rather than Riverside. No announcement was made and after we exited the bus, and it drove away, we realized our mistake. A cast member took pity on us (since it was 90 degrees and I was attempting to carry my sleeping 4 yr old) by offering us a lift almost to our room door in a golf cart. The comment he made was that we weren't the first to make the mistake. I'm just appreciative he was kind enough to offer us a ride. Regarding the pools, we used multiple pools at the Riverside as well as Doubloon Lagoon at the FQ during our stay. All the pools were very clean and best of all not cold. The kids especially loved the water slides which were sized just right for the younger crowd. The food selection in the food court was surprisely good (don't miss the create your own pasta station, it was amazing). The bakery items are not to be missed either, especially the chocolate croissants. Everything we got there was delicious and very fresh. That's not something we've always found at the other resorts. The one negative comment I have to make was about the room cleanliness. While the bathroom area was always spotless, my kids found chewed up dried gum under one of the beds as well as a dirty headband and a partially rotten apple. Overall though, we were very pleased with the hotel, and it was an excellent vacation.

I booked through a travel agent this time and while I still faxed in our room requests, I think our requests were largely ignored because we didn't book directly with Disney. We stayed at Pop last Sept 08 and had all of our requests honored. This time when my husband went to check us in we were able to get a ground floor room only because my husband insisted; we were able to check in early though which was a big plus. I was pretty disapointed in the room furnishings. The armoire and tables & chairs had plenty of scratches on their finish which I thought was unattractive. The light fixtures and any \"hard to reach\" areas were very dusty which was off putting, to me at least. The bathroom fixtures were always clean however. The hotel was quiet and the grounds were very serene which was the best part of the hotel in my opinion. We only used the bus once since we rented a car; nice plus about this all exterior corridor hotel is you can get a room very close to where your car is parked. We didn't recieve any towel animals although it must have been apparent that we had 2 young children due to our 2 pack n play cribs which Disney provided free of charge. We did tip every day and recieved lots of extra soaps, shampoos and towels which we didn't really need. I'm not sure we would stay here again; both my husband and I thought we couldn't really tell much difference in the room size from Pop Century and Pop had more child friendly features like scratch resistant furniture, wall thermostats as opposed to free standing air conditioners, and better positioning of the furniture to accommodate pack n play cribs.

Having our initial worries that it was going to be very full on disney it was very relaxed and scenic with the river running through the grounds and lots of greenery and wildlife. The rooms however were not very big and sharing it with 3 young children the lack of wardrobe space was a problem. The room had what looked to be a large wardrobe but when you opened it the extremely large TV was inside. But the beds were comfortable enough and due to the fact that you were never in it apart from sleeping it served its purpose well. The disney transportation was just so easy and efficient and we never had a problem getting a seat or waiting for a bus, apart from when a private hire one picked us up and took us to the wrong water park. The food was a little boring after 2 weeks of eating the same things in the hotel but in downtown disney you struggled to get a reservation so i would suggest that if you do have a planner then make reservations (your hotel reception will do this for you) can reccommend Portobellos in Downtown Disney and Primetime Cafe in Disney Hollywood Studios. Watch out for Mamma ! The parks are so well organised and would recommend getting ultimate disney ticket as it was so easy to use and fastpass was a saviour but still struggled to get on the more popular rides. Toystory Mania is a must for young children but the queues for fastpass went quick. Did not use the disney dining plan and when looking at options dont think it would have saved us money. All in all would definately reccomend this hotel if your main plan is to visit all the disney parks as it could not be better located and the boat to downtown disney was one of its benefits as it meant not having to queue for the bus back to hotel at night.", "Date": "May 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barrie, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cAMAZING resort - very relaxing after a day in the parks\u201d", "Author": "ontariocanadafamily", "ReviewID": "UR29400446", "Content": "I promised that I would write a review as I found all of them on here so helpful....

The grounds are absolutely gorgeous! The resort is tranquil and very relaxing and the weather was delightful, sunny and warm! There are boats that take you to Downtown Disney and that is a great esperience in itself. The rooms are \"moderate\" as they are listed, clean but not fancy. The rooms have two sinks which was very convenient and there is also a frig. which is great for fruit , milk and other drinks. If you love coffee, take your favorite kind with you as the coffee at disney (everywhere) is horrible. There is a small coffee maker in the room and you can get half & half at the food court. Towels were rather dingy for the first 3 days and then we got nice white thick ones for the rest of the time we were there. The beds are only changed once every 3 days. We stayed in Magnolia Terrace and were pleased and found it very quiet. The only con for us was the check-in staff -----not great--- and for us they were not accommodating after requesting a room with a king size bed and on an upper floor (I have severe allergies to mold, dust, etc) way back in February. We were first put in a room on the first floor way at the back of the building facing a parking lot, and it was musty smelling and damp when we went in. We had to go back to the desk lugging heavy suit cases and insisted to be put on the second floor. After 20 minutes the young fellow finally came out and gave us a room on second floor, not offering to have our luggage taken back there for us and clearly not particularily pleased to have to wait on us for a second time. Perhaps another clerk would have been more helpful. I should have insisted on speaking to his Supervisor and would definately do so another time. I would only go back to this particular resort if I were guaranteed, in writing, a king size bedroom on the upper floor facing the river or side. That was the only thing I can complain about as the rest of the vacation was just spectacular!!I You can rent bikes, boats, surey's (bicycles with 4 wheels and 2 seats) horse and carriage rides (even the horses have a bag type catcher so that the droppings are not going on the grounds!) The food court has a lot of good selections. If you like coffee, tea, soda pop, lemonade, etc., it is a good deal to purchase one of the mugs that they sell for about $13.00 and you can get all the refills you want for the duration of your stay at any resort. It is not good at the Theme Parks. If you want a real eye opening treat, go to the Grand Floridian Cafe for a lunch of dinner, it is absolutely awsome! The entertainment in the evening is out of this world. You can use your dinning plan there and the food is great. To get there you take a bus to downtown disney and catch the bus to the Grand Floridian Hotel or you can get there by monorail. It stops in front of the Hotel. Allow about an hour to get to any restaurant for reservation. Also, most restaurants require that you arrive and check in with them 20 minutes prior to your reservation, we saw folks turned away from Crystal Palace because they arrived at the time of their reservation. Be there early!!! The little french pastery shop at the French pavillion in Epcot is wonderful, you can have them pack up a sandwich or what ever takes your fancy, grab a nice bottle of wine across the street and have a wonderful supper in the comfort of your own room after a busy day of exploring. If you are going to the swimming pool take a towel from your room, there is a rental charge if you get them at the pool. If you plan to take a cell phone and you are from Canada, check to make sure (from a reliable source) that you will have service. We asked at the aliant shop and they told us it would work, it did not. The cards you purchase at the resorts at Disney are $10 or $20 dollars and give you 19 minutes for $10.00, the problem is that you are charged connecting fees and on top of that, it starts deducting minutes as soon as you dial the number .... I was left with 5 minutes of actual talking time. Get a calling card from Canada before you leave --they don't have connecting fees.

The bellman that drove us to our room was also exceptionally nice and friendly. The grounds of the hotel were beautifully kept and had all the little 'theming' details you come to expect from Disney. The room itself was very clean upon arrival and stayed that way throughout our stay; it was a bit on the smaller side but suit us just fine. It had a small fridge, safe, iron and ironing board. There was 5 of us in the room so the trundle bed was used by an adult. She seemed to be okay with it as there were no complaints. The hotel also had an expansive food court and sit-down restaurant; I recommend the food court but not the full-service restaurant (Boatwright's). We were quite disappointed with our meals. My wife and I ordered the Jambalaya and I have to say it was the worst I ever had, meats were tough and salty. My wife sent hers back to get just chicken with rice. It came back extremely salty so she ordered something else from the menu. That was prepared so tough she chose to skip the dinner altogether. We had eaten a turkey dinner at the food court the night before and that was ten times better than the Jambalaya. The main pool was very nice and big. The wife and kids had a good time there. There is a boat that takes you to Downtown Disney at this hotel, which was pretty cool and convenient. Also we had the convenience of having a bus stop real close to our room. During our entire stay I only had an issue with waiting for a Hollywood Studios bus. It took one hour for one to get to the resort, which was very uncommon considering that the most we usually waited was 10 mins. on any given occasion. And although we did not take full advantage of the Early/ Extended hours I have to say it is a nice perk to have.

This resort was everything the reviews promised. The grounds and location along with the food court was fantastic. We traveled as a group of 8 which included myself, my husband, our 4 children aged 9, 12, 13 & 16 along with both our Moms aged 71 & 75. We stayed in the Magnolia Bend which was centrally located to the pools, the food area and two bus stops. The service we received was excellent. Our only complaints were that the check in line up and the concierge line up were both very long. We were supposed to have ground floor rooms as our Moms' struggle with stairs but ended up on the second floor which luckily had an elevator, but this was still inconvenient for our Moms' who were driving rented electric scooters. Also we did not get the adjoining rooms we were promised (as the resort could not put the six of us in our immediate family into one room). We were right next door to each other but this wasn't a great way to sleep at night . Our room was a little dusty in some hard to reach places and our fridge initially wasn't working but it was fixed immediately. However the grounds and location more than made up for it. The highlight of this resort was the boat ride to downtown Disney. It was so beautiful and for the most uncrowded. It was a great way to unwind from the huge crowds in the parks. We loved the pools and the laundromat was right next to our building (another plus for us). When the check in and baggage delivery took too long the staff found a private van to get us on time to our dinner show reservation. The food in the food court was reasonable and no long line ups and always an empty table. Beware though, no free internet services any where and no business center to access a computer. We used the Disney Magical Express to travel from the resort to the airport and this was a definite bonus. On of our real disappointments had nothing to do with the resort but one of the benefits in staying at the resort which was the added hours that were supposed to be available only to those staying in the resort. This did not happen in any of the late evening hours, anyone who was already in the park was allowed to stay.

Talk about the time of our lives! If you have never in your life experienced Disney, it is a must do, have to have, Top notch vacation! Even me yes me. could not find one thing to complain about! Yeah that\u2019s right! Even from the start, when our flight got delayed due to bad weather, and we didn\u2019t arrive to Disney until 10:00pm at night! Disney greeted us with a 75.00 credit, and a gigantic welcome with a smile! We stayed at one of the moderate resort\u2019s Port of Orleans Riverside . Beautiful! Clean! Excellent service! Animal towels everyday, Mickey soap, shampoo, clean room everyday! We took advantage of the dining plan which includes: Character breakfast/dinner one each day, counter meal each day, and snack each day. We all gained 5.lbs. We ate at the best restaurants; Hollywood studios had two great ones: Hollywood and Vine, excellent buffet style. They had a beautiful salad bar, Prime Rib, Roasted Chicken, Seafood Pasta Alfredo, and much more, then there was 50\u2019s Prime Time, this was themed after 1950\u2019s style home kitchens. All of the server\u2019s names were mom and they were all in character, they made you take your elbows off of the table, eat all your veggies, and say yes mam and no mam, the food was great home-style cooking with Pot Roast, Steak, and Fried chicken. In Epcot they had a fantastic restaurant by the name of Laisellie (spelling oops!) this is a 5 star upscale spot in the Canada section; here is where we celebrated our daughters 13th Birthday. We each had a Filet topped with garlic mushroom gravy; they sang and brought my daighter a telephone with Goofy on the line wishing her a happy Birthday. We ate at several other places but those places stood out the most! Okay the fun begins! We started with Magic Kingdom AWESOME from the moment you step through the front gate! I am talking Huge Parades every hour, Music was phenomenal, everything was over the top, perfect, and nothing at Disney is half way done! We took advantage of the free fast passes and never stood in line more than 20 minutes (this is available to everone until the passes run out. You scan your room key and the machine will print out a ticket with a time for you to come back and ride the ride, you have to get these early in the day). The end of the night fireworks show \u201cWishes\u201d was breathtaking, I cried three times, just in disbelief that I was actually there. Watching my kid\u2019s faces was just indescribable! I always felt that my kids were spoiled and unappreciative, but not this time! They were so grateful and happy! No arguing! Just in complete Bliss! 2nd day we went to Animal Kingdom, which is like going to the zoo! My son was even pulled into the Lion King Stage show! 3rd day we took a rest and slept in, went swimming over at French Quarter, which by the way is availble to all guests. We took a Ferry boat to downtown Disney for shopping with the $200.00 gift card that came with the package! I ended up buying three lanyards with Disney pins! Let me tell you about this! Every kid at Disney is doing this! You buy a lanyard with character pins, they are all valued differently! The trick is! You buy cheap and go around to cast members who wear the Lanyards with Pins and you trade with them. They have to trade with you no matter if you have a small inexpensive pen you can trade for whatever pin you like. So let me tell you, my kids had more fun running up to the employees asking to see their pins and trading, than they did riding the rides! Fantastic idea from Walt Disney because it detours the attention from standing in line to trading pens. So all of the kids walk around comparing there pins to the other kids, before you know it it's time to board the ride! So anyway, back to the trip, so after we were rested from the Ferry Ride! We took the monorail to one of the other resorts and had a wonderful dinner at Ohanas with Lilo and Sticth at the Polynesian themed resort with big sumo wrestler looking chefs behind the big flames, grilling up Steak, turkey and giant shrimp on skewers. This is a literally a feast! Not beetr than Texas de Brazil, But similar! The next morning we woke up and went fishing at our resort, where my 9 year old son caught a fish! He has been talking about catching that fish for days now! \u201cCan you believe I caught a fish\u201d he say\u2019s over and over geeesh! Then we headed to our favorite park of all Hollywood Studios! We went there twice! The American Idol Show was great! If 7you want to audition you have to be 14. And it takes an entire day if you get chosen to do the show! So be prepared! OMG! Everywhere you look people are acting like big Hollywood stars, driving around in old time cars, big extravagant colorful costumes. Parades, and the best show I ever seen was Fantasmic! AWWWWWWW! It is a water show under the stars! They play cartoons on a huge Water Screen, with vibrant laser lights and fireworks. I can\u2019t even describe it other than beautiful! Music was moving and just a perfect ending to a perfect day! The next day we went to Epcot! We enjoyed visiting all of the different country\u2019s France , Canada , China , Germany , America , Mexico , each of the counties had a show telling about the country! Very educational! My husband got pulled into a show! Hilarious! Best rides must get fast passes for these: #1 Souring (Epcot) you feel like your flying, this ride is amazing! #2 Test Track (Epcot) you drive in a race car going 60 around a speed track, testing different road conditions ice, heat, bumpy. They even do a crash test with you on it! #3 Rockin Roller-Coaster (Hollywood Studios) 0-60 in .2 seconds! #4 Toy Story Mania ( Hollywood ) You\u2019re inside of a video game #5 Dinosaur (Animal Kingdom) Roller-Coaster, You have giant dinosaur\u2019s popping out at you. #6 Tower of Terror ( Hollywood ) Big Hotel elevator that drops you 15 stories! Well that about tells you our vacation story! Making memories! Enjoying Family! And loving this life that we live! P.s. Word of advice! # 1 Take your own camera, do not trust disposable cameras! As you can see the quality of the photos are terrible! But\u2026. At least we have pictures! CVS damaged a whole roll! I was very hurt!

This time we tried Riverside (POR) and were more than happy. After spending six hours per day within the theme parks it\u2019s great to walk by the quiet river and bridges of POR. The food court has upscale pasta and salad bar options and does not resemble the mall like atmosphere of the CBR food area. Our room was slightly run down and was not immaculate but where can you find hotel rooms that are brand new without paying over $300? The size was fine and the location is what I requested in advance. I found it worth paying slightly extra for being near the river and food/check-in area (a/k/a water view). The water taxi to Downtown is worth the trip even if you have no interest in Downtown - - it\u2019s a quiet distraction from a high energy trip. The main pool is crowded but has a great waterslide for kids. If you want a quiet pool, the other six or so are not heavily used. The Magical Express operated without a hitch. The only complaint I may have is that the buses to the theme parks did not work like clock work - - especially to/from MK. They came in clusters and sometimes had to wait up to 30 minutes and most of the time there were no seats. Overall, I again have to give Disney credit for doing what they do best, which is providing a magical experience. The one insider\u2019s tip I would give is that during a morning or evening when extended magical hours for resort guests are offered, actually try going to another park, where you may find even less crowds, especially on the transportation to/from the parks. Also be aware that most attractions within the respective park are not open during extended magical hours. For more info re: POR, I found the following site to be helpful: www.portorleans.org.

The on-site restaurant was forgettable. The best advice we got before going was from a friend who works at the park. It's worth spending a little extra to stay on Disney property for the convenience. You can take a bus to any park from your hotel. That saves time and gives you more of the day to enjoy the parks. But, it is not worth spending extra money to stay in one of the most expensive resorts like the Grand Floridian. Basically, as our Disney friend explained it, there's little difference between the rooms themselves in the different levels of resorts. You're basically paying for the extravagance of the lobby and the restaurants. If you want to experience that, better to book a table at one of the high-end resort restaurants and have a great dinner there. But there's no need to spend hundreds more a night to sleep at the high-end places. We had an excellent meal at Jiko, the Animal Kingdom resort restaurant one night.

The first visit was let down by very poor housekeeping, so I was slightly concerned when I re visited this resort. However, I had nothing to fear, perhaps leaving a tip everyday helped, but, the housekeeping was much better this time. As a female travelling on my own my major concern is safety, this hotel made me feel secure at all times, it has a lovely charming relaxing atmosphere and because it is so popular there were always plenty of people about. The rooms are a nice size, I would imagine four adults would find it a tight squeeze as there are not enough hangers in the 'wardrobe', although I'm sure if you asked housekeeping would provide more. For a family with young children it would be quite comfortable. For myself on my own it was great. The staff were in general friendly, although they need to train their new staff better, particularly in food hygeine as one night a new employee from China attempted to give me a display pasta salad that had been under lights for god knows how long and didn't understand when I tried to explain it could give me or whoever ate it food poisoning, that aside I had no other real problems with the food court except that it can be a bit boring for choice in the evenings and for snack choices, even the All Stars provide a better choice. My other gripe came on checking in, the lad on reception gave me directions to my room that led me all around the houses and I was furious after 15 minutes of looking to find that it very near to the river itself. All he needed to say was across the bridge, building with the square fountains first floor at the front. All reception staff should have training in giving directions and made to walk around the site to familarise themselves with the layout. The fifteen minute walk with a heavy suitcase after a 10 hour journey didn't enamour me at all.

We checked in late afternoon and the lobby was extremely busy to be the value season. Check in staff were polite and efficient. We were placed in the Magnolia bend buildings the first \"mansion\" closest to the bridge. Our room appeared to be and smelled clean. My brother and his family had the room next door. We were close to the bridge that takes you to the lobby and food court. The walk to the 'Ol Man Island was not very long, my two y.o. nephew could even make it. The quiet pool and laundry were a short walk away. The smoking area for the two smokers with us were close by and I must compliment the location was not some ugly out of the way place yet it was not so close to rooms that it may offend. The bus terminal closest to us was the main stop at the lobby which was moderately busy most of the time. There was however another bus stop two buildings over that was quieter and offered a visually nice stroll if we were in no hurry. As for mousekeeping I must say yes the quality of cleaning is not top notch, most of them speak little english, therefore it is sometimes difficult to communicate to them your needs. But most of us who travel and especially if you are not familiar with Florida this is how things are here, don't get upset over it. Best advice is to take it in stride and find ways to ease the situations. We were always smiling and saying thank you even if we got decaf instead or regular coffee, or hand towels instead of bath, etc... then we would politely ask again for what we still needed. With kindness in your voice and on your face I feel this helps ease the situation and make it less stressful. The food court is where we mainly had dinner. With two growing, hungry boys this was our best value. We were able to eat here for around $40 and our hollow legged boys were full and everyone could choose from a variety of foods. Pizza, make your own pasta (two could share this meal with a salad.), Carving station with roasts, turkey and hams, southern side dishes (greens, mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, etc.) the old stand by burgers, chicken strips and fries. There is a bakery and cold case with salads, fruit, juices, etc. The quality of the food would in my opinion be equal to golden corral or such places. The French Quarter fc had somewhat different menu items which adds to the variety if you eat at the resort courts, and the walk is about 2-3 minutes maybe less. The grounds, pool and rooms were clean, however I agree that the rooms need new carpets or thorough cleaning. But as we experienced first hand, Disney staff are CONSTANTLY working on things. Case in point follows: My brother had maintenance knock on our door (early), when we opened it the gentleman apologized and pointed at my brother exclaiming \"he made me do it!\" My brother then exclaimed \"you gotta see this!\" These men came in and changed out the Air unit and replaced it quicker than a NASCAR pit road crew! Our dad worked maintenance in a hospital for 30 years, so seeing this was astounding to say the least. These men told us they are always changing them daily at all the resorts and when they have made it to the last room they start all over again. They get taken to a shop for cleaning, charging and repairs to be used again later. They stated that Disney is constantly working such projects like these to keep the resorts up (hence \"maintenance\"). So, if you get a room that looks worn, you just got one that has not been taken care of yet. They do their job and stay busy,these people are the unsung castmembers of the \"WORLD\". Our overall experience with PO Riverside was great, we got to do most of what there was to offer and enjoyed it all. We would have loved a water view, but we didn't open the windows to our room much so it would have been wasted. Why stay in your room when their is so much to see around the place? It was packed while we were there, yet we never were disturbed by anyone. One exception was like another person said was door slaming from \"mousekeeping\" coming in and out of nearby rooms. We did have a couple of times where the bus just took sooo long! But again the \"World\" was busy for a value season. I must say one bus driver in particular was great, we were his first group of the night and he made us feel like we were on \"Letterman\" or \"The Tonite Show\", he gave a monologue and jokes, welcomed us to the bus and stated he would be here til 3 am. He even offered photo ops for us as people departed. We literally took him up on this and still have a pic. We never once came across an ill mannered castmembers on our trip, although we did witness some annoying visitors (line jumpers and the types with expired fast passes or no fastpass and pretend they didn't know and they get on the ride anyway. If it had been me they would have made me go to the back of the line!) But as for PO Riverside, If you go here with the understanding that Disney properties are always higher w/ less accommodations. And this is not five star housekeeping nor five star dining. Remember to try to keep a friendly face when dealing with castmembers who do not understand you, try to help them understand you and they will do their best to accommodate your wishes. It truly is their job to make you happy.

The grounds are lovely but that was about all I can really say on the positive side. I traveled with my husband and 3 children, ages 10, 6 & 3. When I arrived there at about 5 pm on Tuesday, there were about 5 people in front of me in line to check in and only two people working at the front desk.

I had requested a room in building 14 which is close to the main lobby but when I arrived I was told that they could not accommodate me and that I had been placed in building 24 which is very far out on the property. They offered to move me the next day which I accepted. We ultimately did not end up switching because we realized we were close to a pool that was open and a bus stop which suited our needs better after all. The room was fairly small (equivalent to a Best Western or Comfort Inn) but I expected that. Our room was not cleaned very well - almost every day we had to call for more soap, shampoo, pillows (they kept taking one away from us -weird). I noticed that the floor was not vacuumed at all and I also found a Micky shaped pasta under the table which must have been from someone who stayed there before us. I have stayed in all levels of hotels and am not that picky so I just tried to go with the flow but I was bothered by the price I was paying for very minimal service.

I worried that it would be too much Disney, too much of the time. But it wasn't. Very relaxing. We didn't have a car and didn't miss it. Stayed at the Riverside in the Magnolia building. After reading some of the reviews I was a little apprehensive as to what the room would be like. We arrived at 1:30 a.m., so check in was not too much of a problem (certianly no long lines). I asked for an upgrade, but at that time of night could not get one. Finding the room was a slight challenge. The room was way in the back and the signs did not seem too helpful in getting to the room. Once at the room, it was clean and quiet. It was far from the restaurant. The next morning I asked for a room closer to the restaurant and they quickly were able to find me one. We moved our own bags (though they offered to do that) and found this room to be clean with no problems. Lots of clean towels (including the five extra I was given off the cart), extra coffee, etc. Fridge worked fine. Beds were comfortable for us (maybe a little too hard if you like a soft mattress). The pools are clean and at this time of the year, not crowded. The food court area is large and has a variety of foods, plenty of check out lines, and lots of seating. If the weather is nice, there are some outdoor tables (but you must enjoy birds to sit there). The main restaurant was only a few dollars more and very enjoyable. Be sure to get reservations. The French Toast was excellent. The lounge area was o.k. We stayed for part of the entertainment one night, but that was just o.k. I would have liked a variety of entertainment on different nights since we were there for seven nights. More jazz to fit the theme would have been great. The gift shop (with some food and drinks) was more than adaquate. The one day it rained some of the Cast members came in and offered games to help pass the time. I highly recommend the Magical Express to and from the airport. This was a last minute trip, so we did not get our luggage tags in time and had to pick up our own bags (which was fine since we were getting in so late). The check out service for the airlines was really great. They give you a phone number to call and pay the airline fee for checked bags. Take your bags and the confirmation number showing you paid the fee, and that is it. They weigh your luggage so you know you are not over the limit. We didn't see our bags until we arrived at our home airport. They also held our carry on bags until we were ready to leave for the airport. The resort bus service was perfect for us. We waited no more than about 12 minutes (and that was for a downtown disney bus in the morning when few are running). Be sure to use the stop closest to your room. Riverside has four bus stops scattered around the buildings. The boat trip to downtown is relaxing and takes about 20 minutes. At night, the return trip can get crowded, so plan to wait for a few minutes. All the cast members were really nice and friendly. And I can honestly say we had no complaints about staying at the Riverside. But please remember, we were there the last week of January, so crowds were very light. One helpful hint. If you like spending a lot of time at Epcot, you might want to think about staying at the Boardwalk. You can walk to Epcot and Studios. In fact, the walk from Boardwalk to Epcot is shorter than the walk from where the resort busses drop you off.

We stayed in Bldg 17. Unless you don't mind doing a lot of walking then this location is ideal. The problem is that it takes about 10 minutes to walk to the bus stop, lobby and food everytime you need to do anything. Not practical with small children. We also had to pay for a waterview room because the regular rooms were all booked and keep in mind a waterview room may be of a stagnant watering hole. The rooms are really small. There were 5 of us with a trundle bed and 2 double beds it makes for a crowded area. Luckily we don't spend a lot of time in the rooms. The food I thought in the restaurants on the grounds was average to above average. My daughter really liked the make your own pasta bar. We didn't get to take advantage of our refillable mugs like we would have liked because of the long walk to the area to get them refilled. The staff was somewhat helpful when asked questions. Word of caution, when you set up to have things charged to your credit card on file while staying there they have a limit of 1000.00. Noone told us that at check-in. So on day 5 when we hit that limit our cards were being declined at the stores in the parks even though we knew we had enough limit on our credit card on file. I then waited in line that evening for 25 minutes in the lobby to find out that I had to go ahead and pay the 1000.00 against my credit card on file before I could charge anymore???? Didn't make much sense to me since I had already given them permission to charge that credit card on day one at check in. Two other issues....the wait for the buses is way too long. We almost missed reservations because buses were taking 20 - 25 minutes to arrive and then making additional stops once they picked us up. It was really hard to plan. Lastly, they really need to do something about their check out procedure for checking your bags for Magical Express on the day your leaving. We had to wait in line for 45 minutes and then they make you catch the bus to the airport 3 hours before your flight when you have already prechecked everything. Alot of wasted time on your last day there. We were very rushed around just to sit at the airport. The main swimming pool was closed for refurbishment so we had to take a boat to the French Quarter.

We found the inside of the rooms fairly basic and on the small side and not the cleanest, but nevertheless adequate for our purposes given that we did not spend much time in the rooms other than to sleep. The rooms are definitely not posh or 5 star, but of moderate rating. The outside of the buildings were beautiful, very clean and well maintained and styled in the southern plantation manor. The walkways and grounds were also very well kept and beautiful with many trees, foliage and the lovely Sasagoula River with many little bridges crossing over it. Our rooms were perfectly situated very close to the dining hall and main reception building which also had a decent souvenir and small food store along with a small bar/lounge. In addition there was a fantastic little wharf area that had many different types of boats to rent and ferry terminal to catch the ferry boat to downtown disney (about a 15 minute ride with some good scenery). Our building was also very close to two swimming pools including the larger and excellent pool at Old Man's Island. The island also had bar. The bus stops for connections to everywhere in the park were also very close by. We found the main dining hall to be fairly quick on most occassions despite usually large crowds. The staff were very effecient and polite. We never had any trouble finding seeting. Note that we only ate here for breakfasts however on the Disney meal plan. Most of the breakfast and bakery foods we found to be tasty and of decent quality with the exception of the coffee, which is without doubt the worst all of us has ever had. Disney has a contract to use only Nescafe instant coffee which can best be described as hot tasteless brown water! We craved Starbucks greatly during our stay. We had some fantastic dinners in the park at Teppan Edo in Japan pavilion in Epcot, Le Cellier in Canada Pavilion at Epcot, Wolfgang Pucks in downtown disney for lunch, Boma at Animal Kingdom Lodge, Coral Reef in Epcot, Chef Mickey's in the Contemporary Resort and Akershus for Princess Storybook dinner at the Denmark Pavillion in EPCOT. The only complaints that come to mind about our resort are that Disney gouges an extra $10 per day for in room internet access that is not even wi-fi and the connections are very slow and irratic. The plug is also most inconveniently located behind the tabel between the two beds instead of beside the table and chairs near the front door of the room. Also, the prices in the store in the main building were quite steep, most notably for beer and alcohol, e.g. $5 usd per beer or cooler and wine and spirits approx double the price of anywhere outside the park. We can see Disney adding a premium, but double or more is an outrageous gouge. The beer and liquor in the parks and restaurants is also ridiculously overpriced. We plan on going back to Disneyworld when are children are older as we were there 10 days and didn't even come close to seeing all there was to see in Disney World, let alone the additional things to see outside the park such as Seaworld, Universal and Kennedy Space Center. We would not go back for less than 14 days next time given the amount to see. All in all a fantastic experience! We would recommend this resort on the basis of its excellent central location and lovely grounds/setting. It also offers pretty good value for money relative to the many other hotels located within the park. Next time we go we will likely stay at the Animal Kingdom Lodge so we can enjoy the savannah views and setting with all the animals right outside your window.", "Date": "February 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, NC", "Title": "\u201cDecent value, gorgeous grounds, pleasant staff\u201d", "Author": "Aerosmith", "ReviewID": "UR24407446", "Content": "I brought my mother to Disney with me to be my cheerleader while I ran the Disney Marathon. We ended up paying $$$ for a cab to Disney because the line for the free Magical Express was nearly out of the door, and I had to get to the Expo before it closed. This was a good move because we beat the bus to the resort, and I was able to check in with only about a 10 minute wait. The staff and check in were extremely friendly. The hotel grounds are huge, and it was a little confusing finding our room, but the grounds are spectacular. Every staff member (a/k/a \"cast member\") had a smile and was pleasant. Our room had 2 full size beds which were very comfortable. The bathroom area had 2 pedestal sinks with a ledge for your toiletries that ran the length of the wall. There was another, wider shelf along the perpendicualr wall as well. The bathroom/sink area could be separated from the bed area by pulling a curtain across the room. This was a great convenience when I had to be up at 2:30am to get ready to catch the marathon bus at 3:15am and didn't have to wake mom up. There are 2 restaurants on site, one is sit down, the other is cafeteria style. We only had coffee there. The bus service to the parks is great. I would have rated this hotel higher if it had 2 queen beds rather than the 2 full size (double?) beds. It was just my mom and I this trip, and we each had our own bed. However I would like to return with my children and it will be a tight squeeze putting 2 people in 1 bed, regardless of whether it is 1 parent/1 child, or 2 parents or 2 kids in a bed. I think Disney does this to force us parents of teens and tween to upgrade to a deluxe resort that has queen beds.

We decided to stay at a moderate resort as opposed to a value resort in hopes that we may receive amenities that would otherwise be unavailable. We chose Port Orleans: Riverside because of it's \"homey\" appearance, affordable rate, and its easy access to the water taxi that serves as transportation to Downtown Disney. Upon arrival, the facade as well as the interior of the resort was all that we expected it to be. Clean, reminiscent of the old south, very pleasant. However, upon checking into our hotel room, we found ourselves rather.. underwhelmed. Two double beds, a television, a table with two chairs, a bathroom, two sinks, and a nightstand, nothing special. We quickly unpacked and decided to spend this first day exploring the resort. While the rooms were not spectacular, the resort provides its temporary residents with an array of things to do. There are 6 quiet pools that are indeed quiet. They are located in secluded alcoves in the resort and serve as a place to relax. I personally never made it to the large \"noisy\" pool, I found no need; I was quite pleased with my experiences in 3/6 quiet pools. Furthermore, the resort has an arcade that has a plethora of games for all kinds of people. My family and I spent many a night after a long day at a park racing to the arcade for a game of air hockey. Outside, one may rent a bicycle and take a ride around the resort, absorbing the breathtaking scenery and crisp clean air. As far as food is concerned, (**side note--I recommend getting the meal plan, it is a beautiful thing that takes your mind off of paying for the expensive food in Disney World) the riverside mill is a buffet of sorts that shifts from breakfast to lunch. The food isn't spectacular, but it serves its purpose: a quick meal to start your day. My family and I did not eat at boatwrights, only because it is the same food you will receive at the riverside mill. Your money (or meal card) can be spent elsewhere on better food for dinner. All in all, the resort was a fun place to be. If you are doing Disney the correct way, you will only be in your hotel room to sleep, so not much concern is needed when dealing with it. OH!

As we had stayed there before, over 10 years ago, we knew what size room to expect. What we forgot was that the double beds are really doubles, and were too tight to accomodate our two grown children and my husband and I. One (adult child) had to sleep on the pull -out trundle bed (they are only in Alligator Bayou, I heard) each night and they took turns, they both said the bed was \"fine\". Fortunately, they are not very large young adults! We stayed in a very convenient location as I had requested in advance. . It was building 14 and was near both the main building with the food and registration, and near the main bus stop that goes to the parks. there are four on the property, this was the South Depot. The room was quite clean and in good repair. The service was good to excellent and seemed to depend on who cleaned the room. Plenty of whatever you needed, I would leave a note with the tip! The pillows were okay, not the best but at least not so big that they break your neck. The mattresses were about medium in hardness. Grounds: People rave about the grounds. It was quite cold most of the time we were there, so we could only appreciate looking at them, they are very beautiful. Transportation: We used the Disney Magical Express. I don't like to be parted from my luggage for too long, so we transferred it to the bus ourself. the service worked fine in both directions to the airport . The buses fron the property to the Disney parks usually came fairly quickly, waits ranged from a few minutes to 25 minutes (that was unusual) and we always had a seat. We did not try to take buses to other hotels, but my son did one afternoon and it took a long time, he had to change buses and was told the wrong bus to get on, etc. I would think you would want a car if you did a lot of that, we did not rent one. There are busses and a boat that take you to Downtown Disney (with restaurants, shopping and entertainment) , the buses seemed to run very regularly. Food: We ordered food before we left home from gardengrocer.com, this is a service where you can pick out what ever you want on-line and have it delivered to your room , prices are the \"high\" end of a regular grocery store and they deliver it for a fee of $12 for less than $200, free if above that. the refrigerator in the room is big enough to hold quite a bit of chilled things, but it does not have a freezer. This service worked very well and saved us time and money by our usually eating breakfast in the room, and making sandwiches to eat in the park for 2 or 3 days. The food in the cafeteria at Port Orleans Riverside is okay, probably the breakfast is best, but the lack of variety does get to you after a few days. If you really are fussy about what you eat, you won't eat there every night! The prices were reasonable. They do have a small general type of store on property, but the prices were very high there Overall: We enjoyed our trip to disney and going to the parks most every day, and the property was fine. If i had to do it over again, I think I would spring for a second room for our adult children as the room was really quite tight for four adults.

It was a bit long, which really is to be expected. Once checked in, we left the airport quickly. The bus made two stops before getting to Riverside. We had reserved a king room, which is what we received. However, the original room assigned to us was on the very end of the property. When I located it on the map, I asked to be moved to one a little bit closer to the main building, which was no problem at all. They seemed happy to make the change for us. We were in building 18 in Alligator Bayou. Our room was a very spacious corner room that overlooked the pool. The room was very clean and didn't appear to be \"worn out\" like other reviewers have said. The bed was comfy, the linens were nice, the pillows were soft and we promptly received extra pillows and blankets when we requested them. The enitre resort was very quiet--we rarely heard or saw any other guests. The only complaint (noisewise) was that the toilets flush very loudly--almost like rockets taking off. Every now and then, we would hear someone flushing a toilet. There are 4 bus stops in the resort and the buses were running regularly. We never waited longer than 10 minutes for a bus. We always had a seat on the bus, but it did get crowded on a couple of rides. Still, it was extremely convenient. I would definitely use the Disney transportation again. We used the Magical Express transportation back to the airport, which worked out great. The bus got us there with plenty of time to spare and the bus driver was very friendly and helpful. We had also looked at the French Quarter when we were first booking this trip--we had a chance to see it while there and I'm glad we chose Riverside instead. The grounds are much prettier at Riverside and the atmosphere is better. It's true that the resort is huge but they have 4 bus stops for their guests.

To our surprise they expected my 17 year old son and 13 year old daughter to sleep together. Because we booked through Disney, they are very aware of the ages of children you are brining so I was very surprised of the sleeping arrangements. I immdiately called the front desk and spoke to the night-time supervisor. He listened to me and agreed that the sleeping arrangements would be inappropriate and moved us to another room. Mind you it was past midnight by now... the room sizes are all the same. All I wanted was a cot brought up but for some reason they do not do that in this section. So we were moved to the Magnolia section which was beautiful as well. If you are looking for a large room, this is NOT the place for you. However, if you are looking for a room to accomodate you and your family with beautiful outdoor surroundings then this is the place for you! The stream was beautiful with all the bridges. The water wheel was so neat! The restaurant was very nice with both counter and sit down meals. On certain evenings they offered a camp fire with other fun things to do.... The pools were nice. And I agree the waterslide was a tad bit lame but it was quite cholly when we were there and pools were not used. We also did not use the bus transportation offered. We had our car and decided we would drive to the parks since parking was free and the options to come and go as we please was nice for us. We have stayed at The Grand Floridian.

We arrived mid morning on the 4th ( a few ours prior to check-in) and were pleasantly surpised to find that our room was already available. The staff were all quite accomodating and polite during the entire checkin process. The room was located in Aligator Bayou, as I had requested to be as close to the main building as possible. The grounds in and around the buildings were very well kept, as you would expect with many Disney properties. We had a king bed room which seemed as if it must of had a recent facelift. The bed, flooring and furnishings all appeared very clean as if new. Other than the slightly smaller size and lack of a flat screen tv, we found the room nearly identical to the quality of rooms we have experienced at the Wilderness Lodge and other deluxe level resorts. Overall, the room and buildings location gave our stay a very cozy and slightly rustic feel. After a long day at the park, it was very nice to be able to return to the resort and park almost right below our room. As other reviewers may have stated, be prepared for a pretty hectic experience at times in the resorts restaurant area. We waited in line for our food at least 10 minutes at times, and then waited again just to pay, only to spend another 5 minutes trying to secure a table. I imagine that we could have just picked the busiest meal times of the day. We had grown use to the less crowded meal times at Wilderness Lodge which had virtually no waiting in line. Although we drove down, we did make use of Disneys transportation system, and found that buses ran regular to all parks every 10-15 minutes or so. I know that our trip was during a least crowded time of the year, so I imagine that the wait could be quite a bit longer depending on when you go. Overall we found the experience of staying at Port Oleans Riverside to be a good one. It was a nice place to come home to and relax after 8-12 hours out in the parks. Due to the fact that we came primarily to spend at much time out in the parks as we could, we werent as concerned with staying at a more expensive/nicer resort, but were quite pleased with what we discovered here. We found this to be a wonderful time of year to visit the parks as well, as we waited an average of no more than 15 minutes in line for any attraction (of course using fast passes throughout the day didnt hurt either). If youre looking to make a trip down to Disney but dont want to spend a lot of cash on a bed for the night, I would definately recommend this resort. It offers all the benefits of being on Disney property without breaking the bank in the process, while at the same time still managing to be a pretty nice place.", "Date": "January 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cWe loved Port Orleans Riverside\u201d", "Author": "ScotlandDollyDimples", "ReviewID": "UR23521400", "Content": "I was worried about my stay at Port Orleans Riverside as I had read some terrible reviews and I can honestly say we had nothing to complain about.

This hotel makes the Animal Kingdom feel like a palace.

The room is very small and the beds are also small. That being said, our room was quiet and we got what we were looking for, a place to sleep. If your vacation happiness hinges at all on the quality of the hotel room, you should spend more and stay somewhere else.

The hotel maintenance manager was really nice and had the disney pest patrol check out our room and found nothing- thank goodness. Who could sleep comfortable in that hotel after that?

We love the beautiful landscaping and long walks you can take. The boat ride to Downtown Disney is fun too. The buses run fairly quickly from the 4 bus stops. We took advantage of the free parking you get when staying at a disney resort and drove to all the parks, except for the magic kingdom, to save time. Because the parking for the magic kingdom is on the other side of the lake from the magic kingdom entrance it's actually much faster to take the bus because it goes directly to the entrance. Our room was a short walk across the pool island (nice pool!) from the food court. The food court is somewhat average, I do NOT recommend the hamburgers or fish basket, very bland and overpriced. A negative for riverside is one that I've been hearing from my other disney travelling friends. The room upkeep has gone downhill over the past 5 years. I was a bit disappointed since the carpet was a bit worn, the tile a bit dirty and nothing seemed bright, new and maintained like I remembered from previous visits. My family tends to sleep late (9:30 or so) and then stay late at the parks. We heard almost no noise from adjacent rooms with one big exception. When the housekeepers started cleaning they would pull out the metal locking bar on the door so they would not have to keep using a card key to unlock the door. Unfortunately, since the doors close automatically they would make a booming metal sound each of the 20 or so times they entered and left the room. Not a pleasant experience.

We have stayed in the budget to upper range of Disney Properties for the last seven years.... Sadly i do have to report this is the worst and very unhappy with our experience at this resort.. First i must say if you are more than a family of four NEVER book this resort unless you are ready to leave your luggage in the car and take in what you need daily as there is no room to unpack, no room for luggage just small and cramped space, The rooms with the trundle beds have no linen on them and the cover that is on the thin mattress which is more like a mat is thin and DIRTY.. I would not lay my pet on it no less my child. The towels are old and shabby and better towels can be found at a thrift store.. Added to that the sink area has a tile floor and a marbe counter and they give you GLASS drinking cups which they place on this narrow counter over the sink and can easily fall and shatter in a million pieces. The eight days we stayed on property the glasses were never changed.. I guess in trying to save money Disney did away with paper cups but bar glasses sure don't belong in the room with floors for them to shatter on and to cut someone. The services of housekeeping stink. My little boy brushed his teeth looking in the full length mirror which is on the bathroom door. The whole time we were there housekeeping did not clean it once. The tub i would not let my child bath in and we took showers. the tub is dated and shows major signs of wear and dirt. The carpets are filthy and my son who was playing on the floor with toys had black marks on his feet and knees.. The grounds outside the room are lovely and the pools are clean.. The staff is nice and even being crowded there is places to sit if you want to go to the dining hall.. The place does need a good cleaning and sadly not worth the money you spend staying there.. I wish i could give a better report as we do stay yearly and make reservations asoon as we get back from our previous trip but we have not this year and probably won't.. We spend too much money to live in suitcases and filth!

The toilet and bathtub were old but in working order. The beds were only double, so it helped that my one daughter stayed next door with my parents, because the beds were small. I heard that some of the rooms come with a trundle bed. The cafeteria style restaurant that we ate in for breakfast/lunch got real crowded at certain times. The buses to Disney were a great convenience, but they also got crowded. We enjoyed the boat ride from the resort that took us right to Downtown Disney. We also took advantage of magical hours-when certain parks opened early or stayed open later for resort guests. Make sure you have your room key. You needed the key to get on the attractions after hours. My kids loved the resort pool area, called Ol Man River. We ordered pizza and they had fun playing bingo with the staff.

I know everyone has their own experiences, and they are all different, but we have stayed here a dozen times, and we have a ball every time. We had 2 rooms for me, hubby, and 2 sons( ages 25 and 21). The rooms were connecting, although we didn't ask for them to be. We ended up having my nephew join us for a few nights, so it was nice having the extra room. The bathroom is small but functional, with the toilet and shower/tub combo. The double sinks are separate, and the sink area is private with a curtain you can pull closed to dress, etc. The bath area is granite countertops and slate floors with granite accents. The rooms are clean and decorated in an outdoorsy way. The property is spread out, but a pleasant walk with stamped concrete to look like wood planks, and native Florida landscaping. There are squirrels and ducks everywhere to add to the backwoods feel. My only complaint was the bar at the main pool was closed. This was the first time it has been closed during our stay. The food court was very good, and the prices were a little high, although I didn't think they were outrageous. We typically eat at the food courts and pass on the sit down restaurants due to time constraints. We did find the place got really busy the day after Christmas, with a huge influx of guests. Most of the people visiting seemed to be foreigners. I do have a bit of advice for inexperienced Florida visitors~ my son and I got eaten alive by the evasive NO SEE UMS. I laughed at a post from a message board from a poor lady who thought she had been attacked by bedbugs. The Florida NO SEE UMS are a small biting insect ,like mosquitos , that bite, and leave you with welts within 24 hours. The welts then become pussy with golden puss, they scab over. They itch a couple of days. The No SEE UMS are worse around water. To make sure you don't get bit, spray on some OFF. The weather was in the 80's and this probaly added to the bug attack. They had 2 horse drawn carriages going during our stay. We did take the bus one day while the other boys went golfing. We had to wait about 20 min before the bus picked us up at our stop.

So, we arrived to Port Orleans Riverside, it was beautiful as always (my husband and I stood here 1997 when it was called Dixie Landings). Check in was great and fast.

Keep in mind that this is one of Disney's \"moderate\" resorts. The name is exactly what it says it is - moderate - it is not one of Disney's \"deluxe\" resorts and it is certainly not a luxury resort by any means. Do not expect that - if a deluxe or luxury resort is what you need, then pay the extra money for one. However, the grounds of Riverside are beautiful and generally quiet and serene, rooms are clean and satisfactory, and the amenities are plentiful for a moderate resort. Here are some observations about Port Orleans Riverside and some general recommendations I think may be helpful: 1) First and foremost, DO YOUR RESEARCH before you book your room and before you go to Disney. Look at Trip Advisor reviews, buy a current travel book on Disney World and use this website - www.wdwinfo.com - it is an \"unofficial\" website on Disney, has a ton of information on all things Disney and comes in very handy. For instance, it is true that the Riverside grounds are very large. For us, and because the grounds were so picturesque, it added to the appeal. However, because I had gone to the website above, I had looked at a map of the resort in advance and picked the building I thought looked the most centrally-located. When I made our reservations through Disney online, I requested this building. When we checked in 11 months later (at 11 a.m. without difficulty), the lady at the counter had us in a different building. I nicely asked her if we could be moved, she made a phone call to see if a room was ready there, and made the change - no problem! Disney is there to please, and courtesy and politeness is appreciated by them as well. I'm sure they deal with more than their fair share of cranky travelers so be nice! 2) We traveled with three adults and a teenage girl. The room was plenty big for all of us. It is not huge. The curtain between the double-sinks and the bedroom area is nice for changing or getting ready in privacy, even while someone else is showering through the door. The room was also clean. Based on some of the pictures below, I was looking in the corners and cracks and crevices for something gross - but found nothing. 3) Our housekeeper left us fun surprises - a Christmas tree made out of a large pine cone the first day and different towel animals other days. She left us plenty of extra coffee packets each time so that the three of us were able to enjoy at least 2-3 cups every morning. Tip your housekeeper! 4) Two observations where I thought the resort needed to improve. First, the quality of the towels are not great. They are thin, and sometimes stringy. Second, the doors to the rooms, at least the ones I saw, needed a fresh paint job. Hopefully Disney is getting around to fixing both! 5) Food in the food-court area was fine. We especially liked the create-your-own omelets for breakfast and the create-your-own pasta for lunch. One day we walked along the river to the French Quarter and had lunch in the food court there. They have made-to-order beignets. Anyway, it was nice to have two options. 6) We spent time at both the main pool and the smaller pool by our room. Not having any little kids with us this trip, we thought the main pool might be too noisy or little kiddy for us. Though there were kids, of course, it was not loud. There is a bar at the main pool that has fun cocktails and beer. We also went down the little water slide a couple of times! Towels are available at the main pool, but not at the smaller pools. 7) The bus transportation is fine. The longest we waited for a bus was probably 10 minutes. Also, depending on which park you're coming back from, you may stop at the French Quarter to drop off its guests first (there is only one stop at the French Quarter, though, compared to Riverside's four). 8) Utilize the free Magical Express if you're flying into Orlando. It was so nice not to have to worry about our bags. We checked in and went straight to a park. When we got back from dinner that night, our bags were waiting for us in the room. (As a side note, we chose not to take the Magical Express back to the airport because you typically have to leave the resort at least 3 hours in advance of your flight. We took a cab. If you do this, call the bell desk and arrange a time for them to pick up your luggage - they won't make you lug it through the resort. They'll also check it for you if you want to hit a park before you leave.) So \u2013 have a great time at Disney and the Port Orleans Riverside! We would stay here again, but would like to try other resorts in the future because Disney has so much to offer.

This is the down to the nitty gritty review! I will be completely honest and give you a review from a regular middle-class stay at home mom of 2 kids. Resort- I was a little disappointed in the resort. For the money we paid, we could have stayed at the Hilton across from Downtown Disney. The only reason we stayed inside Disney was b/c of our 2 year old and we thought the convenience would override anything. We found out that anything you buy can also be delivered to the Hilton or any other \"offsite Disney\" hotels. Just so you know, a double stroller rental was $170 for 6 days. I could have bought a jam-up stroller to keep for that price. My own fault though for not checking ahead! The resort is very \"green\". Breakfast was ok, but the burgers were great. The piano man was awesome, although we didn't eat at that restaurant. You could see him as you walked through the hotel. I wish I had heeded the warning from the other review that said it's hard to make the south interesting when you live in the south. I think this resort would be great for someone from the city who lives in an apartment, but we can see woods in our backyard. Also, there was not much for the kids here. They had a 25\" or so tv in the lobby playing the classic cartoons. My kids thought it was great. There was also an arcade there that my 5 year old son loved. They did have carriage rides and boat rentals, which we didn't do. The boat to downtown Disney was convenient. The room was clean and service was great. We needed extra blankets and towels on 2 different occasions. Each time they were there within 5 minutes.No cute towel animals, though. Also, the guys who helped with our luggage were super! One gave us tips and the other talked like Donald Duck for the kids. Super-nice guys!!!! I can say that I would not want to stay there again. We went to the Hilton just to see what it was like. It was more beautiful than the PO Riverside. We also toured the campground at Fort Wilderness. It was awesome!!!! We have already booked for 2009. It had horseback riding, a marina, pools, playgrounds, smores campfires at night, Mickey's Backyard BBQ, Hoop De Doo?, etc. So many things for kids!!!! Places to eat---- We had the dining plan and saved lots of $$$$. The average meal would have been about $100 for dinner and counter service (hamburger, fries, wraps, combos, etc) would have been about $40 for 2 adults and 1 child. We paid $38.99 per adult per day. Favorite was Wolfgang Puck's Cafe at Downtown Disney-sushi was excellent!! Mud pie was best dessert at Disney World! Boma at Animal Kingdom Lodge was very interesting and very tasty! Pecos Bills at MK was good for a counter service (dining plan is good idea) Kona Cafe at Polynesian is awesome! Le Cellier was delicious! (Canada at Epcot) Tokyo Dining was good. Raglan's Road had best bread pudding ever, but chowder was not good. I had mixed grill. It was good. I hope this helps. Have a good trip.

In order to accommodate 5 ,our choices were limited. We stayed 4 days 3 nights at Port Orleans Riverside. We are from Michigan and live on a farm. I wanted this one and only true vacation to be wonderful for our 19,16 and 11yr old daughters. A Christmas to remember. Due to snow storm we arrived later in the day and in the dark and we were given a map indicating to \"go over the bridge stay to the left, circle around to here\" and your room is in this area. Wow, after what seemed 20 minutes through the curvy, dark, sidewalks with 5 suitcases we finally found our room.The hideabed was a mattress on wheels. NO SHEETS which at 7pm is a bummer.The room was fine. Quiet. My recommendation is get closer to the main lobby. Dont stay in 34, recommend 17,18 otherwise you are in the boonies. Each time we went to the lobby we never found the same way twice. It is too spread out. The food is definitely overpriced. YOU MUST take the dining plan. We took the shuttle(fortunately close by) to downtown disney and ate our Reserved dinner at Wolfgang Puck $168 ,good food, good portions, our favorite. The tip is not included and is 15-18%. Bring extra$! We purchased breakfast the next day and traveled to Polynesian Resort ate at Kona Kafe good, $65+ tip. Monorail to the Magic Kingdom. The older kids did not like MK. Bored after the fast rides were exhausted. The castle and night parade were great. We ate off the 2 meal Dinner Plan Plus 1 snack/ each day We recommend paying for breakfast (cheapest) and use the plan for Lunch (cafeteria service) and Dinner table service (make reservations for dinner), The Crystal Palace was nice- character dining. Prime rib, salmon, shrimp, and other palatable kid foods $190 + tip. EPCOT The Princess Story Book in Norway $215+ tip, small portions - character dining, over rated. The kids overall were not particularly impressed by the characters, and likely would avoid character dining in the future, in search for better food. Disney personnell were great. Crowds at Christmas and waiting 70 minutes for rides were the norm. Take the Fast Pass opportunity. Advantages: since you have access to any Disney area, you can eat or go anywhere. We brought our swim suits and when we were tired of walking at EPCOT, we slipped over to The Beach Club and Yacht Resort and swam a couple of hours. Changed our clothes and went to finish Epcot. In the future we will pay the extra dollars and stay at the Yacht Club. Alot less hassel for kids enjoyment and less shuttle service required. We left Disney and Alamo car rental picked us up and brought us to their door. We traveled to the Gulf coast and stayed in St. Pete. Beautiful beaches. Returned the car at Orlando Airport easily.

It is something to ask about though because it made for some long bus rides when they had to stop at the other stops before they took you to were ever you were going! We have also stayed at the Animal Kingdom lodge which was great! I totally recommend it if you have the money to upgrade to a deluxe resort, one main reason is that you don't have to go outside for anything if you don't want to. One day that we were there it rained buckets on us all afternoon so we went back to the hotel and it was covered all the way from the bus stop to our room and then we did laundry and went to eat , they had activities going on for the kids and we never had to go outside and get wet. At the Riverside we would have had to go outside and have quite a walk to do all those things. Anyway back to the Port Orleans riverside, I was also disappointed that they could not guaranty us adjoining rooms, we booked 9 months in advance and had a Grand Gathering and they still could not guaranty us adjoining rooms or even side by side. I was told to call 3 days prior to arrival and ask then, which I did and I was told they still didn't know if we would get adjoining rooms and then the night before we checked in I called and was told we would get adjoining rooms, but we did not, they weren't even side by side.

We have got to know this hotel and some of the staff very well over the years and the kids have always looked forward to staying here. The hotel is very big, it takes a bus fifteen minutes to get around the whole complex. There are plenty of pools in the complex although the bigger one (ol' man river) tends to get a little too busy. All disney hotels are nice, well maintained, well staffed and above all very secure. From the moment you arrive at the gatehouse check in, you know you are going to feel safe and relaxed. This is classed as a mid range hotel by Disney, but it isa decent four star to say the least. The rooms are spacious, with comfy beds, good size bathroom/shower and sat TV. The big thing about Disney is that you feel like you are part of it, that you are coming home as such, and you only really get that feeling by staying in one of these big resorts. Most nights we would get the 30 minutes ferry boat to Disney Downton & Marketplace. There are plenty of shops and restaurants to choose from and the BIGGEST Disney shop in the world. It is worth mentioning that the last two years we have travelled to Disney, we have used the Disney Dinning package. This is a MUST especially if you have children. You can get to eat in any Disney restaurant, but you must book early. We planned and booked our dinners 6 months in advance. Sadly we will not be going back to Port Orleans next year as we have booked a two bedroom/kitchen suite in Saratoga Springs for 2009. We feel a change (although only small) is needed.

We were hesitant to try a different resort, as we were very comfortable with CS, but we were actually a little \"tired\" of the Pepper Market at CS, so we stayed at POR. It was a good decision, as Port Orleans, with it's beautiful and tranquil grounds, is probably the best of the moderate hotels within WDW. The boat ferry to Downtown is an attraction unto itself. We did pay a visit to Coronado Springs and it seems that resorrt has now been positioned as a convention property; we noticed several businessmen around the property with alcoholic beverages whooping it up a bit after the meetings and seminars. Um, not the kind of atmosphere I'd want my kids around. The POR food court gave us a lot of dining options and we ended up doing pizza a few nites and sharing a lot to save money. With four kids (three under 6) you can't spend $50/60 for every meal. We were able to do a lot of meals under $40 and all were happy and filled. You can't beat the free shuttle to and from the airport and within the WDW complex. Although it did seem that the shuttle buses were way less frequent to and from the resorts/parks as opposed to our previous stays at CS. Still, I guess it's also a matter of being at the right place at the right time and catching the buses at the right moment. But for the convenience of not having to drive for a week, you put up with having to wait a bit for the buses. Besides, we're on vacation. The rooms are small, as they are at most Disney properties. And to pay an extra $150 (or more) to stay at a Deluxe resort for an extra 100 square feet of space doesn't make sense. And it's really true that you are only in the rooms to sleep. We were up and out everyday at 8a and returned around 7p. Just in time to grab dinner, a shower and then sleep. And boy do you sleep after a day at Disney. We didn't spend a lot of time in the pool, mostly because it's tough watching the little ones, but the times we did go in, the kids just loved the little waterslide. How can you beat it? It looks like we're not going to do Disney this year, but we can't wait until next year when we will definitely return to Port Orleans Riverside. We still have fond memories.

One Adult and three children (age 11, 12 & 14). The check in process was quick and efficient; we arrived at noon, and were promptly given our keys to our room even though check-in time is at 3:00 pm. We were asked if anyone was a 1st time visitor, or if we were celebrating any birthdays. Answering yes to both questions got us buttons to wear; the kids loved that. All three children were celebrating birthdays, so our check in person asked for their favorite character. On day three, we returned to our room and were surprised to find color photo cards; addressed and autographed to each kid, wishing them a special birthday celebration. That was a nice touch, and it even impressed the 14 year old. The room was more than adequate in size for the four of us, there was plenty of storage in the drawers for us to unpack and get comfortable. Since the kids were boys and girls, it was nice to have the curtain section near the sinks for some privacy. Our room was nicely located in Oak Manor, facing the river and next to one of the small pools. We were a very short walk to the main building, the main pool, the boat depot, the food court and the South bus Depot. I had hesitated to make the reservation at Riverside, wondering if one of the \u201cPOP\u201d hotels would be better for the kids and was surprised to note that they really enjoyed the look and feel of the hotel. They loved crossing the wooden footbridge over the river. We all enjoyed the quite peacefulness of the resort, especially after a long day at the Parks. Meals in the food court were quick, efficient, and tasty. We had one lunch, three breakfasts and a number of snacks at the hotel. My picky eaters ate almost everything. Although I had rented a car, we did not use it. It sat parked not far from our room for the duration. We choose to use the Disney Transportation each day, which was wonderful. The busses do get crowded, and on a few occasions we did stand on the bus. But the Port Orleans Riverside is so nicely located that it never took more than 20 minutes of travel time to arrive at our destination. The queue for the return from the parks was very large, and our hotel seemed to be full the dates we were there. Sometimes we saw three or four busses arrive at one time, or shortly after each other. We never had to wait more than 12-15 minutes for a bus; which was just good timing on our part. The boat service from Riverside to French Quarter and to Disney Marketplace was fun and enjoyable. Our boat driver gave us an update on the construction along the riverside, while keeping us informed of time tables, and how to return from the Marketplace if we choose to travel after the last boat at 11pm. We were prepared to \u201cover use\u201d our fast pass, but the parks were not as crowded or full as we had expected. We used the fast passes, so we could ride something a second or third time. We didn\u2019t miss out on anything we wanted to do. It was amazing to be in the Magic Kingdom at 11:00 pm on Friday Night then again at 9:00 am on Saturday Morning and see the Christmas Decorations that \u201cmagically appeared\u201d overnight. I had dinner reservations for three nights, and each one was better than the previous. We started at the 50\u2019s Prime Time Caf\u00e9 in Hollywood Studios on Thursday; if you go please say hello to \u201cUncle Tim\u201d for us. It was a treat to eat in mom\u2019s kitchen and enjoy talking with Uncle Tim during dinner. And even funnier when he put the 14 year old in the corner for not eating his string beans. Even when Uncle Tim disguised them as desserts, the kids would not eat them. We all had a great laugh. Friday was at the Contemporary Hotel at Chef Mickey\u2019s. Nice way to meet and greet the characters getting photos with Mickey, Minnie, Donald Duck, Goofy and Pluto. Saturday was the real treat, to have dinner at Cinderella\u2019s Royal Table. Cinderella gave my 11 year old daughter a hug like they were best friends that had not seen each other in months. The dinner includes a photo with Cinderella at no extra charge, soft drinks, appetizer, dinner and desert. Just when we were leaving there was also a meet and greets with the godmother and the coach mice. Even the 12 year old enjoyed looking around the castle, and getting photo\u2019s taken with the Knight in Armor. Overall, a fantastic trip, wonderful hotel, which was both enjoyable and relaxing.

Two adults and our 14 year old visited for the 1st time and stayed 4 days. We liked the Riverside Resort property very much. The setting, grounds & landscaping are beautiful. Sadly the Magical Express was disappointing upon arrival. It took too long before it left the airport to drop us along with other newly arrived guests off - too much time and opportunity waisted. Check-in at the resort went smoothly with a very helpful and polite young lady. Then off to our room (#8034) which was not magical at all. Simple, plain, unexciting but functional. Tolerable until I discovered both a filthy coffee maker and hairdryer. (I took photos! Nasty, nasty, nasty). However the beds were clean, well made & comfortable each day of our visit. A few general thoughts about our Disney World experience/lessons - Stop by your local library and borrow a few Disney World advice books prior to booking your trip - they are full of great insights. We would strongly encourage you NOT to use their luggage delivery service - why wait 3 hours for your stuff - one of our bags arrived around 11pm?! The bus system between resorts and parks is a great service & worked well, just expect some buses to be packed with visitors and leave enough time between points. The Disney meal/dining plan is a TERRIFIC VALUE! Don't second guess it - Buy it! Make dining (table service) reservations. The food was generally very good. Buying food items a la carte in the Disney Resorts without the dining plan, is very very pricey. We reserved dinners at Boatwrights, Mama Melrose's, Ohana & Marrakesh - all delicious meals. Choose your breakfast/lunch/snack (quick service meals & snacks) venues in the parks (Except EPCOT) carefully - they were hit and miss. It was encouraging to find salads and a few other non-typical fast food menu items in a few of the parks venues. The FASTPASS service for the park rides is super, once you figure it out. Use it! Go and see Fantasmic! Wow! Wow! Wow! The evening fireworks displays were very impressive. Take a river boat ride from Riverside into Downtown Disney. Spend a few hours in your room or by the pool regenerating each day - the constant standing, walking and lines are draining. The Magical Express back to the airport was prompt, efficient and easy.

I will begin by saying that the hotel was by no means full and my review will probably reflect this. Both my husband and myself agree it could be a really diffent experience (not a particullary good one) if the hotel was busy!!! I found every area of the hotel inside and out to be very clean and tidy. The reception staff were always on hand to help, and with a smile, we never had to wait long in a queue. The rooms are NOT posh but are adequate for crashing in. We had two small double beds and a small childs pull out bed, one bedside table. There is a table and two chairs, a bench and tv cabinet, with draws underneath. The sink area of the bathroom is open onto the bedroom with a curtain you can pull over, in this area is a hanging rail for clothes - no wardrobe. From the sink area is a door leading to the toilet and small bath and shower over. You have a fridge which is not stocked like a mini bar so great for cooling drinks bought at wal mart. There are 6 pools in the riverside part of the hotel, one with a slide. We used 2 of the 6 and they both appeared to be heated. Later on in the afternoon you may struggle for a sunbed if you want one in the sun, otherwise there were plenty in the shade. They have a lake where you can go fishing. You can hire boats of varing sizes to take out for a spin. You can hire bikes of varing types. In the evenings they have a couple of horse drawn carriages you can take a ride in. ( all extra charge) The free transport worked well whilst we were there, but if it's busy we can see that it could become a bit of a nightmare as previous people have reported. There are coaches constantly running from disney to the hotel and visa versa. You can also get on a boat to downtown disney. At the hotel there is a restaurant and also a small food court. We ate in the restaurant only once - it was dire, food and service. We were rushed through, the main course came whilst we were half way through our starter, half way through the main course we were asked if we were going to order dessert and when we said no the bill was put on the table. The food court was a bit better but really there was only burger/ fish fingers/ pizza/ chips, pasta, roast meat and salad stations. Breakfast was ok but get down earlier rather than later as it gets busy. The hotel sell cups that cost $32 and this allows you to have as many refills from the food court drinks station as you wish during your stay, anything from coffee to fizz drinks, there is also a sink at the staion so you can wash your cups. On these counts I would be very wary about opting for the disney food and drink option as you'd not have the choice to go to eat elsewhere. There are some good restaurants in downtown disney and on international drive. Although the hotel is a disney one it is not in your face, infact if you just stumbled on the hotel i doubt you would realise it was a disney one, except if you went into the shop! Would I stay here again probably not BUT just because we like to try a different hotel even if we are going back to the same place. Would I recommend it to friends with kids.

The hotel is vast, and a little impersonal. Don't expect to see the manager strolling past! However, check in was quick and our room was exactly what I was expecting. Its not huge, but was perfectly adequate for a family of 5. The beds were high enough to stow the suitcases underneith, which helped. Mousekeeping was absolutely brilliant. They arranged the childrens toys into amusing situations every day, left towel animals and cleaned to room to a satisfactory standard. The children raced to the room at the end of the day to see what their toys had been getting up to. It was a lovely touch. The room was a little walk from the main foodhall, but it was a very pleasant walk, and only took about 4 minutes. Over the last few months I've read many reviews which had lamented the distance involved. I think its healthy to have a stroll after a meal, and there were quite a few folk here who needed to do a bit more walking! My husband hated the foodhall with a passion, The carvery was fine, and the pasta bar was good too. The bakery was ok. However, the pizzas were dreadful, and the childrens options were very poor. I tried to get the lady serving to give me 'adult' chicken nuggets for my daughter - as they looked a bit more appetizing than the childrens ones. She was very unhappy to oblige, but I stuck to my guns. The customer is always right. Boatwrights restaurant was fine - we ate there twice. Its got a very limited menu, and again the childrens options were very poor, As a Brit I found it quite disconcerting that waiting staff would swoop on the table and remove a plate as soon as someone had finished. Don't they realise that this is a real faux pas? Leave the plates till everyone at the table has finished! Its not rocket science! The waiting staff were attentive, but I grudged leaving the requested tip, when they repeatedly removed plates before we required. The corn bread was very good though. The boat to downtown disney was brilliant - very pleasant way to start or end an evening, and we never waited more than 10 minutes or so. However, the buses were disgraceful. If all you want is to get to the parks within half an hour, with no regard to safety, they hit the spot. The heavy wait times predicted in previous reviews did not materialise. No wait time was longer than 20 minutes, which I think is acceptable. However, what is definately NOT acceptable is the crowding on the buses. I think it is ludicrous to expect small children to stand, holding on to rails. What happens if the bus brakes suddenly? It doesn't bear thinking about. Occasionally adults could be pursuaded to vacate their seat to allow a 3 year old to travel more safely, but more often than not, the adults already seated would look away, avoiding meeting the parents' eyes. Shame on you! Give your seat to senior citizens and children you rotters!! Also, much has been written on the web about Disney system of giving priority to motorised scooters. I don't mind at all waiting on someone who is genuinely disabled - and I realise it can be hard to tell - but there were occasions when we were held up considerably while the driver loaded on someone who was not disabled, but who had hired a scooter for the duration. A walk round the park would probably be just what the doctor ordered! The pool and landscaping of this hotel is fabulous. The lifeguards are very attentive. Generally the staff were good. Don't try to order pizza with a Scottish accent though. The non English speaking staff made the food court a trial at times. The shop is grand - with just the right mix of goods for sale. I probably won't stay here again, but that has more to do with the bus safety issues than any issues with the hotel itself. We stayed here a fortnight, and felt it was a little long.

They ended up putting us in the Oak Wood Manor Building 90 Mansion side; boy was that the best building ever. We had a corner room, looking at the river and a beautiful fountain. There was also a quite pool next to us as well. There are so many things to do at this resort that anyone could make a vacation just staying at the resort without going to any of the parks. They have horse and buggy rides, boats, and several other wonderful things to do. Our favorite thing to do was to take the riverboat to the French Quarter and Downtown Disney - wow what a beautiful site. I will have to agree with other reviews that the buses to the parks were a little overcrowed at times, but nothing super bad. The food court was the best way to go as far as taste and cost.

For our timeframe, the Port Orleans Riverside was the only moderate hotel offering this rate, so we chose to stay there. Our room was in building 28 of Alligator Bayou, which was some distance from the main resort buildings, but was quiet and very close to a smaller auxiliary swimming pool. From our building we used the west bus depot for transportation to the parks. This was nice at it was generally the first of the resort's bus stops. We had a standard 2 double bed room with a small table and chairs. Nothing fancy, but large enough to give the 3 of us room to move and as most things Disney - it was clean. A couple of nice feature about these rooms were the two sinks and separate room for the toilet and tub/shower. A couple of improvements would have been nice for the sinks to be in a counter rather than pedestal, and for there to be a fan in the bathroom with the tub/shower and toilet. Overall, however, the room was fine. As it seemed we were always in one of the parks, we may not have fully utilized our resort's amenities. As I mentioned there was a smaller pool very near our building that we used. We did try to use the main pool, but it was closed due rain. The main pool did have an outdoor bar. We did not use the main restaurant or bar in the resort, but we did get some take out from the food court. No complaints about the quality - I thought it was reasonable for cafeteria food. In the evenings when we purchased food there were baked goods, a salad bar, pasta bar which included pizzas, and a more traditional meal counter with items like turkey & mashed potatoes, etc. Overall I liked the relaxed tone of the resort and would stay here again. Maybe my only complaint is with the size of the resort and the distance we were located from the main building, but that was balanced out by the quietness we enjoyed. As for additional notes on transportation, the trips to Epcot and Disney Studios seemed quick, and the trip to the Magic Kingdom was just a little longer. Certainly the longest ride was to Animal Kingdom. We also used the Magical Express transportation to and from the airport. The trip went smoothly both ways, possibly helped that we may not have been at the busiest time of year.

I would likely stay here again with the kids - they'd love the main pool, the fishing hole, etc. (But this was a kid-free week!) Getting around to the parks was easy and convenient, though the Magic Express from the airport was really rather slow. I only have a couple of areas of concern: 1) There seemed to be something in the room I was allergic to. There was some mildew in the bathroom that might have been the culprit, but I'm not sure. At any rate, my sinuses and throat would flare up any time I was in the room to the point I had to go to urgent care to get medication to take the swelling down in my throat. After being out of the room for a while, I felt much better, then would go back and it would start all over again. 2) Dining options at the resort - one of the things that was recommended to us was to visit the resort restaurants at lunch time when they were not as crowded or booked solid. The restaurant at Port Orleans Riverside is not open at lunch. They have a food court, but to be honest, it wasn't really that good. At dinner, they had additional options that were much better, but those items, such as carved roast beef or turkey with all the fixings, are not available at lunch time. So that was rather disappointing. So, I think this is a perfectly fine place - just a couple of things. We stayed with the kids at the Fort Wilderness Lodge a couple of years ago, and I really liked that much better. But, it is a bit higher priced option, too.

This is a really good hotel if you want to relax after a long day out and have a bit of down time from Mickey and friends. The hotel resort is huge and very relaxing, you can even go fishing at the fishing hole for $10 a hour which my husband loved (Fish not huge but great relaxation) There is a bit of a walk from most rooms to the bus stops/ shop and main bar but this is not a problem unless you find walking difficult. The only downside with the walk is that if you buy a refilable drinks cup ($12 I think) then you keep having to walk to the front of the hotel to fill it. The rooms are great and the Housekeeping did not let us down. We have found in America if you leave a small tip every couple of days rather than all at the end you do get a slightly better service. This is probably because they get paid less than $3 an hour. The main pool is lovely and nice and warm, there are other pools dotted around also. The Pool Bar is great and again relaxing. We never had a problem with the buses. They run about every 20 minutes but we found them more frequent than this. If you choose to go to the parks around 11am then the buses will be busy which is why I think people have to wait for the next one. You can also get a boat from the resort to Downtown Disney which run every 20 mins before 4pm and every 10 mins after (Journey time 20 mins) Overall this is an impressive resort and we would visit again.

This hotel is an ideal base for the parks and Downtown Disney, It is a huge resort, with stunning scenery, lovely walkways, plenty of wildlife(squirrels, ducks, lizards etc) but it has got a couple of issues: On our previous visit in 2006 we were allocated rooms in Oak Manor this year we were given Alligator Bayou, building 14, both are ideally situated for buses, food court etc, but the beds in Oak Manor are much more comfortable than Alligator Bayou, none of our party of 6 had a good nights sleep in 17 nights. Rooms are clean and the housekeeping was very good. We visited the bar a couple of times, which was not really to our taste and you need to keep an eye on your change from a couple of the not so friendly bar staff. We found this on our last visit, but think they are a little less friendly this year. Most of the other staff are great - as Disney staff should be. FOOD COURT:- We only used it a couple of times to grab something quick, but it does get very, very busy and there does seem to be only one speed - SLOW! BUSES:- This does need some improvement, one day we waited 30 minutes for a bus to Hollywood Studios, in that time there were 2 buses for Epcot, Magic Kingdom and Typhoon Lagoon, so you can imagine the queue when the bus did eventually turn up! Most of time the wait was only approx. 10 minutes but they do squeeze in as many people as possible, again this seems to be worse than before. The boat service to Downtown is really good, you might fall asleep on the return as it's so relaxing. DINING PLAN:- This is the 1st time we have had the dining plan and it was EXCELLENT and it was free with our package - you get 1 counter service meal, 1 snack and 1 table service meal per person per day of your disney ticket. We ate at a few top restaurants ie. California Grill at the Contemporary, the Maya Grill at the Coronado Springs, the Yachtsman Steakhouse at the Yacht Club and the Aloha at the Polynesian (character breakfast)these were all excellent you do have to give 2 of your table service allowances for the signature restaurants, if you plan where you would like to eat, rather than just using food courts you can get really good food, obviously we had to pay the 18% gratuity to pay, being a party of 6, but we still saved a fortune. Other places to try are Planet Hollywood and Raglan Road in Downtown Disney. We actually had 18 counter service meals left this is because we went to Universal, Island of Adventure and Seaworld, any snacks that are left you can use them on crisps, chocolate, drinks etc, we used 17 on the last day for nibbles on the plane. Overall this hotel is very good and yes we would stay here again, because there are more good points than bad.", "Date": "October 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "SOUTH WALES", "Title": "\u201cAwesome\u201d", "Author": "JINXYSouthWales", "ReviewID": "UR20817447", "Content": "This is an awesome family,single,couple holiday .......We are allready booked to go back next year but staying in Animal Kingdom Lodge not that there was anything wrong at all in the Port Orleans I do not believe any hotel in Disney is bad, Its just that inc in our booking was the Disney Dining Plan....Well worth having as we basically spent no money inside of Disney at all ....... I believe they have changed it this year coming 09' to Quick service dining if you are staying in a 4 mickey key rated hotel, If on the other hand you stay in a 5/6 MIckey key you will have the dining plan we had this year dependant on when staying (check out Disneys site for dates). Sept was really a great time to go what little rain we did have was refreshing also the longest we waited for a ride was 10mins & as i mentioned previously the dining plan was amazing we ate at Cinderella's royal table an hour after arriving on our 1st night & also had a character breakfast dinner or evening meal everyday & all these were inc in the table serv dining plan ....even Planet hollywood so the only money we needed were for tips. It was also a year of a million dreams while we there & we were lucky enough to win special park dream time event tickets which gave us the chance to experience Magic Kingdom almost empty it normally holds 65000. people that evening there were approx 250 of us quite spooky but amazing all the same :) I would say to any one booking to stay in 4* or above simply for the plan the quick serv wont give you the character meals but it will save you a fortune especially if you have children with you.

We have previously stayed at French Quarter 3 times previously but felt like a change this year! Check-in was a little slow but there were 7 of us altogether, checking into 3 different rooms. We were happy with the Decor of our room in the Alligator Bayou section of the hotel. We were in building 14 which is the nearest building to the main lobby and food court. The other family members stayed in building 95 other at Magnolia Bend, these rooms have not been recently renovated like the Alligator Bayou rooms but they were still well presented. Our rooms were all clean and well stocked with soaps etc... The food-court was very busy and the main problem was by the time you waited in line to pay for your food, it had gotten cold. No choc chip pancakes at this food-court, which I thought was strange because you can get them at French Quarter which is a smaller food-court? Bacon delicious, burgers good also. Staff friendly and helpful. We also ate at Boatwrights for breakfast 3 times, try the Banana Stuffed French Toast, amazing! Wish I could have some now. Staff at Boatwrights also really polite and helpful. Used the main pool as well as the smaller pools, they were all clean and not too crowded. Didn't use the Bus Service as we rented a mini-van. We used the Boat Service to Downtown Disney once and it was nice, got a seat no problem. We rented bicycles which was fun and we also booked a Horse and Carriage ride around the resort which was very pleasant. The bar at the hotel is not bad but we didn't enjoy the entertainment it was a children's entertainer, not that he was bad, just that it was a bit loud. We visited Scat Cat's Lounge at French Quarter to see Elliot Dyson perform, he is really good.

This was actually my second stay at Riverside, but since my first stay was only a few nights on a business trip it really doesn't count. Check in was initially painless, but I was not provided a room right away (I initially checked in around 12:30 PM). At first this was no big deal and we took our three boys (6, 4 & 4) to Downtown Disney for lunch. However upon return to Riverside, the room was still not available at 2:30 PM, 3:00 PM and at 3:30 PM. After being told that the room might not be ready until after 5:30 PM, I had the issue escalated to a manager and was given another room. This process may not be an issue for families with older children (i.e. - they can check in, hit the parks right away and then come back in the evening) this does not work for other travelers that simply want to get in a room (like we did with our young boys). Admittedly I became very frustrated with the cast members considering that there are over 2,000 rooms at Riverside and they were trying to tell me that none of them were available at 3:30 PM. It is the norm (not the exception) for large hotels to provide travelers with a room well in advance of the standard 3:00 PM check in. This situation was made even worse by the cast member indicating that could end up being well after 5:00 PM before I ever got into a room. Just beware on this front. We ended up staying in Alligator Bayou # 34. At first I thought it was retribution for my escalation at check in since the room seemed to be in the building that was the greatest distance way a from the Lobby and Ol' Man Island. However we ended up enjoying # 34 because it was A) very quiet and B) right next to the West Depot bus stop. It was very nice having only a short walk from the bus to our room after a long day at the park. Speaking of the bus system, I would give it an overall grade of a B. It actually was a little more crowded than I expected (this holds true for the parks as a whole considering it was September - supposedly one of the least crowded times of the year), but our average wait was probably 10 minutes. For those of you new to Disney, beware that in terms of parks the Animal Kingdom is the greatest distance from Riverside. On top of that, the AK bus is often combined with a stop at Blizzard Beach. This can make for a very long ride. Considering that AK ended up being our kid's favorite park, we got to know this route very well. Also don't be afraid to grab a cab (either at the Resort or at one of the parks heading back to the Resort). We did this several times and it was always well worth the $15. Back to the room. Overall it was clean and met our needs during our 8 nights. However there was nothing special about the room or the Housekeeping (no cute towel animals or anything like that). My kids loved Ol' Man Island. While the water slide is probably too tame for teenagers, my kids thought it was the best. The layout of the pool also worked well in respect that my wife and I could hang out on a lounge chair and enjoy a cocktail while the kids enjoyed the pool. The lifeguards are also on top of their game at Riverside. There are always three monitoring the pool and they seemed to be doing a great job. We ate at Boatwrights one night. Pretty much what I expected (which was not much). It is OK when you have nowhere else to go (I think I threw the server for a loop when I ordered a bottle of wine). We ate in the food court once or twice and I would put it in the same category as Boatwrights (once again not much, but will make do). The best dining experience we had at the Resort was the in room pizza delivery. The pizza was very good and delivered in well under 30 minutes. I also used the laundry facilities on several occasions and have no complaints. There was even a \"broken\" drying during our visit that everyone was using to dry their clothes for free. Overall I would recommend Riverside. The grounds are beautiful (my kids loved chasing the lizards), the pool is very good, the rooms are as advertised, the bus service is acceptable and the food is OK in a pinch. Just beware that if you are used to checking into a large hotel before 3:00 PM (i.e. - actually getting into a room) it may not hold true at Riverside.", "Date": "October 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Cayman", "Title": "\u201cPort Orleans Riverside - still a great resort\u201d", "Author": "tinkerbell39", "ReviewID": "UR20504823", "Content": "Have just returned from 14 night stay as Port Orleans Riverside and this is our third stay ( and 13th trip to WDW) at this resort and again we werent disappointed.

We booked directly with Disney and used their Dining Plan, unless you opt for the \"deluxe\" dining plan, tips are now not included and this suited us much better, because unless you get good service you dont have to tip and when you do its your call how much! The room was exactly as we had asked for on the booking, high floor in a quiet location, it was clean and smelt great, we also noticed that the a/c had been updated since our last stay this time last year - the room was always cool, but with the new A/.C it also seemed to remove the moisture so nothing felt damp, which was great. Bathroom was clean, no mould or mildew, no stay hairs left behind and always had fresh towels, and room was cleaned daily, i think the mouse keepers get to know your pattern as we always left early in the morning sometimes returning lunchtime but our room was always done on our return. Bed/sheets were clean and comfy... little high up I am not the tallest person so have to climb up onto the bed, but hey its all part of the adventure. The resort is large but we find the walks from our lodge to the food hall quite nice and part of the holiday.. we walk at a relaxed place and where ever we have stayed in this resort at most its taken us 15 mins to walk but because the landscape is so nice, and the walks with bridges and all the foliage its really nice and relaxing, they even have different coloured paths so you know if you are on the right route! We hired bicycles and also the sea raycers and had a great time, so you dont need to spend all day every day at the parks, we swam in our quiet pool just a few steps from our room, this was always clean, we used the guest laundry, again this was great and really convenient. Also I have never seen so much maintainence, they are always doing something here, last year they were painting the external sections of the lodge we were in, this year they were doing some near to where we were staying this time, and also the main building was getting a makeover! Also they always seemed to hose down around the pools in the early morning. I think that the wildlife in the resort is great - squirrels, rabbits, ducks and also those little lizards are all part of it. The Cast members were good too, always said hello when going past in their carts and waving when on the boats.... all part of it to make you feel like you matter, we never had a problem with rude cast members.

We stayed in one of the \"mansions\" close to the main entrance on advice of our travel agent. Our room was very clean, spacious and suited our needs just fine. The grounds were beautifully landscaped, but Disney could do a little better w/ the lighting at night - it's very dark and difficult to see when walking, Add in all the tall plants and you could easily get creeped out if by yourself. Resort was very family-friendly. The pool: Kids loved the main pool w/ the water slide (grown ups liked it too!) and sprinklers. Lifeguards very observant. Pool clean and warm. Never used the hot tub once I saw a parent bring their toddler in it wearing a swim diaper! Ick!!!! The food court/restaurant: GO EARLY. Food court gets very crowded, especially in the morning. Buy a refillable mug but just remember its only good AT this resort, not at the parks as we were originally told. Also, if on the Disney dining plan, be aware of what your ENTITLED to per meal. Create- your-own omelets and pasta dishes were very good. Send in a family member to reserve a table. Bugs: I read several reviews about cockroaches but I never saw one myself or we'd have been out of there in a hot minute. My husband informed me after returning home that he did see one outside our room on the walkway. There are also plenty of little salamanders scurrying around outside too which wouldn't surprise me due to thick foliage. Buses: Holy cow does this ever need an improvement. Be prepared to wait and get crammed in like sardines. I'm convinced on more than one occasion we were over legal capacity. Hotel staff also swears they come every 20 minutes which is also not the case. If you have dining reservations at the parks, get to the bus stop an hour before you need to at your destination. No need to locate which bus your on when leaving any of the parks, just look for the LONGEST line possible and thats the one for Riverside. Honestly this needs some Disney magic to improve. Also parents w/ young children - don't expect grown adults to give up their seats for your kids. Service: We had great experience w/ the concierge, check-in, wait staff and life guards. All friendly, helpful and provided good advice. The only rudeness we encountered were other tourists! Extras: Character meal w/ princesses in Norway/Epcot and Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party were definitely worth the money. The Polynesian/luaua was boring and didn't keep anyone's interest.

Check-in may have taken a little long, but the desk staff was super friendly and helpfull. He was very good at explaining the details of the resort and how my room key worked as tickets. The food court had a good selection of food and at a reasonable, theme park price. Not too bad. The room was great. We stayed in an Aligator Bayou room. The double beds weren't the biggest, but my wife and I managed to share one just fine. No complaints all week. My son loved sleeping on the roll-out trundle bed. All of the facilities in the room were very clean and working in proper order. During the visit, our housekeeper even left us little towel animals as decoration. We thought it was great.

We stayed in block 16 in the Alligator Bayou section which was about 5 minutes walk from the lobby area although you could be unlucky and get a room in one of the outlying blocks and face a long walk for breakfast. I would not recommend paying extra (as we did) for a water view as the corridors are on the outside of the rooms so you cant really sit on a balcony and enjoy the view. The room itself was well maintained with a nice bathroom. The air conditioning was a little noisy at night. As well as the main Ol\u2019 Man Island pool, there are many other pools around the complex, enabling you to have a quick dip close to your room. The food court has a wide variety of fast food (burgers, pizza, pasta etc) with some healthy options too. Boatwrights restaurant is adjacent to the food court and was able to accommodate special meal requests (my partner is vegan). If you are a UK visitor, I would suggest checking any offers on the US Disney website as you may find some offers that are not available on the UK site - we got the meal plan thrown in free saving $$$, plus a few other extras like a round of mini golf and a free photo in the parks. Finally if you are in two minds about saving a little money by staying off site or spending a little more by staying on Disney property, I would strongly recommend choosing a Disney hotel. Disney staff are so helpful and make your holiday all the more magical. But the big thing is that you get the Disney transport included which makes for a much more relaxing trip back after a day in the parks and also enables you to go out and have a drink in the evening without worrying about having to drive home.", "Date": "September 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cWe loved Port Orleans Riverside!\u201d", "Author": "nakt", "ReviewID": "UR20029745", "Content": "This review is pretty long, but, I did a lot of reviewing before choosing a Disney accommodation, so wanted to provide detail for those who might do the same. Overall, I thought Port Orleans Riverside was a great Disney Resort because it offered peace, relaxation, and a great pool after busy, tiring days at the park. I thought we got a lot for our money in the moderate category. I struggled to decide between Deluxe and Moderate and wasn't displeased w/our choice at all. Overall Resort: We were in bldng. 16, further back then our request of 14 but not as far as it could have been. I LOVED the room. It was very clean, and the decor was wonderful. I loved Alligator Bay and was so happy we ended up there. The theming, too us, seemed more apparent and kid-friendly vs. the Mansions, though those seemed beautiful as well. The rooms offer curtains that form a changing area which is so nice for families. Though the double beds are small, they are comfy. Having two sinks was very nice. I didn't think there was enough room to set toilitries out and would have liked a few more hangers. Other than that, all was wonderful! We always had plenty of towels, mousekeeping was wonderful. The views in AB are so nice, it's such a relaxing place after the parks, with beautiful scenario. I never felt that we had sacrificed in theming from being at a moderate vs. a deluxe. I truly loved the southern theme. POR Foodcourt Review: There is a wide variety of hot and cold options. The make your own pasta bar is yummy but can take a while. The deli sandwiches are good. The fries, burgers, chicken fingers, etc. are good and because that is what so many people eat, always seemed very fresh. Didn't try the salads but they did look really good, they make them there and you pick your ingredients. I recommend getting the refillable mug, whether you are on the dining plan or not. We filled ours ALL the time. Room location Notes: I read before we left that POR was very large and could take a while to get to bus stops, food court, and main pool. I figured, hey, we don't have babies or even very young kids, this won't be an issue. Please don't underestimate the impact this will have on you at the end of a long day or when you're exhausted and want to relax in the main pool. It is VERY spread out, even our location, 16, which is not near as far away as others, seemed like a very long walk at times. I am not complaining, as it is a lovely walk. I am just wanting everyone to be fully aware that it is a WALK. There were several times when my daughter said she'd rather go to the near-by pool (I think it's GREAT that they have these) vs. getting to play on the water slide @ the main pool, just because her feet hurt and she didn't want to walk. I would have loved location 14 or 18! We would absolutely stay here again, however, I might consider paying the extra for the water view, as I think this might help you get a little closer. Also, if we went back w/a baby or very young child, we might consier POFQ for the compactness. Summary, the walks and grounds are gorgeous and enjoyable, however, they can be long and tiring and you need to be prepared that in a lot of room locations you'll do a great deal of walking. This resort couldn't, be more beautiful, calming, peaceful, and expertly themed. LOVED IT! Pool Review: The pool is great. The slide is long and fast and kids and adults both can enjoy it. Despite crowds, we were always able to find chairs. The pool-side bar was very nice and convenient but expensive. I reco getting a 6-pack of beer in the gift shop and bringing a small cooler, this would have been much more affordable and will be what we do next time. The hot-tub is very nice, not a luke-warm, over-taken by kids hot tub. It was nice, hot, and relaxing. Yes, there were kids, but we were never unable to find room in it. There are waterfalls in the pool that are fun to play in. Overall, the pool is very nice, offering chairs, pool-side bar, hot-tub for parents and great options for kids in the size of the pool, water slide, and waterfalls. We had a great time playing w/our 8 yo in the pool. It is open until midnight, but, at 7 when the lifeguards go off duty the slide and waterfalls shut down. There are towels at the pool but we chose to bring our own. We also used the smaller pools several times, these are quieter and more relaxing and are very convenient to the buildings. These were nice to have as a secondary option.", "Date": "September 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coventry", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Landscaping\u201d", "Author": "Rach217", "ReviewID": "UR19939185", "Content": "Well I'm rather late with this review but thought it was time now I'm planning my next trip to Disney World and am seriously considering revisiting Port Orleans Riverside. The Great: * The Theming at Port Orleans Riverside is comparable with the deluxe Disney resorts, its just a matter of personal taste which hotels you prefer, but for me this is one of the best 'looking' * The price. Okay so you could stay at the Hilton or Holiday Inn and get more *'s for less $'s, but for my $ you can't beat being inside the 'world' (WDW not earth 8:o)) * Travel times to resorts. Despite the apparent distance from some resorts, the commute was very reasonable ~30 mins each way, to all parks. I spend more time getting to work each day. The coaches are clean and punctual and if there's a queue at the end of the day at the parks they just provide additional buses * Ol Man Island. The pool is large and nicely styled and there are 5 other small pools if it is busy * Fulton's General Store. A really good Disney Store in the hotel which, quite frankly is about 5 times better (and bigger) than the one at Covent Garden in London. They also do useful stuff like painkillers and plasters. The shop staff were lovely too * Boatwrights. We only used it for breakfast on our last day but now wish we'd used it more. The Eggs Benedict were perfect 8:o) * The boat to downtown disney. We found excuses to go to downtown just to have another trip on the boat. Really relaxing and great views enroute * Surrey Bikes and boats to rent add nice little extras The Good: + The room was fine, plenty large enough and clean. The maid replaced the towels daily and brought new Disney soaps, shampoo and cardboard coasters 8:o) + The food court did some nice fast food. Mickey waffles were my favourite, some food was a bit 'so what' but so what!! The Disappointing: - I had requested a king room with a water view in building 27. You can pay for 1 or the other but not both. There were no king rooms with water views available at all - The aircon unit was a bit noisy (my guess, its a bit old and needs replacing) In summary we will probably go back for a longer stay. It is half the price of the deluxe resorts and way better than half as good.

Our room was clean, sheets fit the bed, and mousekeeping was very diligent in keeping our room clean and our supplies well stocked. Everyone who worked at Disney and at the resort were very courtious and wishd us happy anniversary (Wore our Disney pins) multiple times. At almost every meal, they brought us a little something special ie. A chocolate covered strawberry, or a glass of champagne ,or a cupcake with a candle. These were the nice things I believe set Disney apart from other places, and I for one am glad they kept my dreams alive. The restaurants were really good, especially Spoodles at the boardwalk.

The grounds of this hotel are nice, a small army keeps them that way, even in the awful heat of August when we stayed here. Our room was on the top floor and it was very annoying that other people thought it fine to shout loudly throughout the night and constantly wake me up, including families leaving their rooms from 6am, letting their younger children shout loudly or play around outside other people's rooms whilst they are trying to sleep. We had water tanks above us that were so noisey that they also kept waking me up during the night. I came back, from this hotel, in desparate need of a holiday after the lack of sleep I'd had. The bed was diabolical. It was dirty - both beds had carved, wooden bedheads that had not been dusted for months. I lifted up the mattress protector on our bed and found a used, dirty tissue screwed up, lying on top of the mattress. The mattress was so lumpy and when my husband and I got into bed, we rolled into one another! It was terrible. We did try reporting things to housekeeping, but they were just not interested. If we needed more soap or coffee, fine - they'd bring some more along in minutes, anything more than that, then they'd pretend to not be able to understand you!! Even the manager tried that one, what a very poor excuse and how disgraceful. Disney management do not care about anything but saving money. The bathroom had a very dirty, stained bath - yeuck. The carpet had several stains on. The air-conditioning - there is only one unit in the room, under the window. It had not been serviced in a very long time. The filters were filthy and this is a serious fire hazard - people be warned. My husband serviced ours. Disney should be routinely doing this, they are not - they are out to save money at all costs, beware of this. Due to there only be one unit, it meant that when you got dressed, with the curtain pulled across, you had no air-con in that area at all, this made it very hot and uncomfortable. The first evening we arrived late and went to the food court to get something to eat. I had chicken nuggets and chips and a small amount of salad, I don't know which bit of it made me ill, but I woke up 4 hours later with terrible pains in my stomach and had to go to the restroom where I was very ill - I didn't eat at this food court again. It wasn't being kept very clean - the carpet in there, is dirty and sticky - how mad is it, to have carpet in an eating area?! The tables were all sticky. The food is left sitting around, this is probably why I got ill, please be careful what you eat, if you eat here. I found the staff very unhelpful and quite rude when I tried to get served. We did try the sitdown restaurant at this hotel, once, for breakfast, that was awful too. I had the eggs benedict, which was extremely poor quality in comparison to the same dish I had at the Grand Floridian Cafe, which cost $1 dollar more! I dropped my strawberry from my drink and asked the waitress if she'd be so kind as to bring me another one, as I love strawbs and she bought me one that was mouldy!!! This was just what I came to expect from staff at this place. The boats from here to Downtown Disney - they are open, so you boil alive. It takes a very long time, the drivers are in no hurry and often stop for a very long time at the P>O French 1/4 - so we tried them twice and didn't enjoy either time and took the car, much better! Transport - buses - fine if you like waiting ages - in the heat! Disney's magical express - if you call taking hours for a journey that should take minutes, a driver who got lost and generally being over-heated in an old bus, magical - then go for it. To anyone who prefers air-con, being taken properly from place to place and quickly - then get a hire-car from the airport or a taxi! Even the Disney rep who we found in the airport, MCO, sent us to the wrong place for the magical express to the hotel!!!! If it could have gone more wrong, I would have been surprized. I wouldn't go back to this place if it were offered to me free of charge, I paid \u00a31200 for 2 weeks and to me, after paying \u00a3500 last year to stay at the Caribe Royal - which was far, far better, I would have to be paid a million pounds to stay at this dump again!", "Date": "September 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cA fantastic stay at Riverside!\u201d", "Author": "sar2036", "ReviewID": "UR19713375", "Content": "We have just returned from a two week stay at Disney's Port Orleans, Riverside.

Prior to arriving, I had requested a room in the same building with friends we were meeting there. I was told it would be taken care of. Upon arrival, we were booked in a different buidling, quite some way away from our friends. The hotel said they would move us the next day. We were instructed to call the hotel by 10:00 am the next morning to confirm and that if confirmation was not received, they would assume we were not moving. Since we went to the park that day (and our room was very nice), we decided to stay and did not call to confirm.

I have very high standards and have been lucky enough to stay in some wonderful hotels around the world. The POR was a wonderful romantic base for our Disney stay. There were only 2 negative points throught the whole stay. Firstly, the room we were allocated on arrival was at the back of the resort in the Magnolia bend part of the hotel. There was virtually no view and the room had a rather disappointing feel to it, even though it was a King size room that we had booked. I rang the reception desk and asked if any other rooms were avaliable. I was told that no other King size rooms would be avaliable until the next day, but as this was our actual anniversary day, I did not want the inconvience of moving so we elected to move to a double room in a beautiful spot in Partierre Place. I would highly recommend this Mansion to couples as it is very romantic and peaceful, with rabbits running around the grounds, the fountains and gardens are so pretty it really is a lovely spot to stay. The only other minus was the Disney Buses, they dont really seem to have a timetable and we did have quite a long wait on a few occassions and my Husband did end up standing most of the time to make way for children - obviously he did not mind this but we felt that the busses should be more frequent so that no guests should have to stand after a long day on your feet in the parks. On the very positive side the Food court was much better than we had expected, the oatmeal at breafast was lovely and the Salads at lunch are the best I have ever had. The food court was very good value for money. We only went to Boatwrights once for Breakfast which was nice but I would not rush to go there again. The drinks in the bar are more expensive than the rest of Disney therefore it is not very busy in there. The gift shop is fantastic and you can buy nearly everything you want in there. We went on the horse and carriage ride and our Driver talked to us non stop, which was not ideal as we were looking for a quite romantic ride so we, did not feel this was a good trip to advise you to go on.

This is a HUGE resort which is divided into several sections. Our room was in the Lodge 36 area which is on the north side of the complex near the smaller (a.k.a. the \"quiet pool\") of two pools. As expected of a Disney resort, we enjoyed our stay and would consider staying here again. The room was clean and quiet. It had two double beds and a pull-out trundle bed, a large TV, refrigerator and double-vanity sinks. Our only real complaint was that we felt the beds were too firm and double beds are a little crowded for two adults. My daughters were delighted with all of the wildlife we saw. There were rabbits, a cat, a hundred little geckos running all over and all sorts of birds. The so-called \"quiet pool\" was really nice to have right outside our room. This pool has no water falls, slides, bar or hot tub - so it attracts a quieter crowd. Parents sat by the pool reading and sunbathing while their kids swam. The pool was open until midnight and while we would hear kids laughing and splashing while we walked to our room, once our door was closed we couldn't hear a thing. We would typically head to the parks in the morning, return in the afternoon to beat the heat with a swim and then go back to the parks in the evening. Disney has four bus stops situated around the hotel which take you to their attractions. It was a couple of minute walk to the North Depot which was really nice. The buses tend to pickup and drop-off at these depots before it went to the main pickup area. This meant we usually got seats on the bus so our kids could sit and look out the windows when we left for the theme parks in the morning and were among the first to be dropped off late at night. Epcot, Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom could be reached in about 15-20 minutes from this hotel. We took the boat to Downtown Disney but had problems getting back - there was a long line for the boat back to the hotel so we tried the buses - but they don't pickup as often and there are no queues so everyone had to \"jockey\" to get on the bus when it finally arrived. That's a problem in general with Downtown Disney and no fault of the hotel itself. We found the staff to be friendly although we didn't interact with them too much. They smiled and waved at our kids. At one point, my two year old was having a meltdown in the cafeteria and a staff member came over with a free package of grapes which calmed her down immediately. We ate there once and the food was very good and not unreasonably expensive. The child meals included a main dish and two healthy sides (fruit and vegetables, for example). We were there early afternoon and it was unusually quiet. We tried to have breakfast there the next morning but it was too crowded - it was our own fault because we had gotten up later than usual. I have stayed at two other Disney resorts (Port Orleans French Quarter and Coronado Springs) and have found this one to be of equal or better quality. Our family got a particularly good deal through our travel agent so it was practically impossible not to enjoy our stay. I would definitely stay in the Lodge area of this hotel again.", "Date": "August 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cDisney at its finest\u201d", "Author": "jtkirkfan2002", "ReviewID": "UR19053386", "Content": "We booked our stay here because we have three children and needed the optional trudle bed, something they should add at all of their moderate resorts.

Since we had a pool view we were located very close to the pool and we had about a 3 minute walk to the West Depot bus stop. The West Depot bus stop was usually the first or second stop on the bus list which was great because you usually got a seat instead of having to stand. We were about a 10 minute walk from the lobby and food court, which was okay for our family because we don't really have a problem with walking. We purchased the refillable mugs which was a great deal since we were always filling them up. We also purchased the Disney dining plan which was such a great choice.

We stayed at Riverside for 15 nights. When we go to Disney, we always stay at least two weeks so that we can really enjoy our vacation--and get some relaxation. When we figure the cost of getting there, the small difference between a 5 day versus the 10 day pass, it just makes sense to go for a longer period of time. We've stayed at Animal Kingdom Lodge two times in the past, at least 8 times at Riverside(during many of those times it was called Dixie Landings), and a couple times off property when our youngest was a baby/toddler so we could have a suite without the high price. We prefer staying on Disney property even though we do go to Seaworld(went to Aquatica) and take a couple of side trips to the Gulf side of Florida. As in the past, the grounds were beautiful and the water ride to Downtown Disney was wonderful. The room was fairly clean as long as you don't look too close at the corners or under the bed. Wear your slippers in the room...as the carpet in our room wasn't cleaned(steam cleaned) for sometime. The bottom of my slippers which were cream colored when we went were black when we left. The shelf that you can hang items(like a jacket or beach bag on) was very dusty. The bottom sheets do not fit the mattress and come undone which is very annoying. The last time we stayed at Riverside was in 2006 and I don't remember having these problems---are hotels just going downhill because they don't want to spend the extra money--it's ashame if that's the case. The bed was comfortable and didn't squeak as someone had mentioned in an earlier review. I've never had a bed that squeaked at Disney. I'm glad we didn't have one this time either. We didn't do the dining plan since we take Amtrak's auto train from Lorton, Virginia and am able to take a small refrigerator and plug-in cooler(the plug-in cooler doesn't freeze our fruits and salad as the small refrigerators can). And since we have a car there we are able to go to the grocery store(we like Publix) and stock up on what we need. We also have a pull along cooler that we take into the parks with our lunch, water bottles(I freeze them in my small refrigerator's freezer area), snacks, and we especially like to have a lot of fresh fruit with us. Our 12 year old daughter, my husband and I were on this trip(our other two children are past 20 and tired of Disney) and had a great time. If you are flying in and do not want to pack a lunch and etc., then the dining plan is probably a good value as long as you eat at one of the buffets. If you have room in a suitcase or are willing to pay the extra baggage fee, I would take some food along such as peanut butter and jelly, bagels or pita bread to put it on(bread will get smashed--or they have bread for sale in Riverside's store), some of those powdered drink mixes(or the tube kind you put into a bottle of water), some cereal and powdered milk(you can mix with water in container and refrigerate it to save money--or there's milk that comes in juicebox containers that do not need refrigeration. This will help your wallet and save you from wasting time in the restaurant which is very busy. Your empty suitcase could hold your souvenirs on the way home! You could also take snacks like fruit snacks and whatever else you and your children like. We ate at what used to be our favorite restaurant Boma at Animal Kingdom Lodge and were very disappointed. The desserts used to be very good(excellent!), but unfortunately have gone downhill. The other foods offered didn't seem to be the same quality as in the past either. One of the people that work there told me that Disney is contracting out many of their restaurants among other things and that's why the food isn't what it used to be. I personally think it's because of the Dining plan...they are getting less money and thus giving less quality than they used to. We did enjoy the supreme pizza at the French Quarter(they left part of it cheese for our daughter). Riverside just has pepperoni and cheese. We also enjoyed some of the desserts Riverside has. We tried breakfast at Riverside and were disappointed. The potatoes were very greasy and the bacon not cooked well enough. The food is mass produced and not the quality is used to be. The transportation was terrific again and this is one of the main reasons we stay on Disney property. When you figure in the parking, gas, and time, it doesn't make sense to stay off property. We had a 10 day hopper pass with waterparks. It was more than enough days with doing non-disney attractions. Even trying to get time in to do the quiet pool, Old Man Island, and relaxation within two weeks can seem tricky. Just a note: When you're at Disney or anywhere, do not expect other people to make your trip wonderful. You and who you are with can only do that. Yes, I do feel that Disney employees do try to do their best to make people's vacations/holidays enjoyable, but they can only do so much. I think it is the way we feel about what we are doing and who we are with. Yes, I do expect a clean room, good food, nice attractions, and polite employees. I think Disney needs to sharpen up on the quality of food and cleanliness of their rooms as they used to be in the past.

The first room was large and had 2 full sized beds and a trundle bed. The second room was equally as large and had a king sized bed, and a roll in shower. The rooms were both very clean. The \"Mousekeeping staff\" was wonderful. We requested clean sheets on the king bed everynight as my son has diapers. They were wonderful and he always had fresh, clean sheets on his bed. There were always towel animals on the bed for the children. The trundle was a matress on wheels that went under the full sized bed. This was perfect for my 5 year old. She loved hiding her bed away in the morning. If you do get a trundle make sure to ask for extra sheets and a blanket. They were not there when we checked in and we had to ask and they were brought right out to us. The trundle would probably not be comfortable for anyone over the age of 12. There is a small fridge in every room. We requested a room close to the main bldg and we were given one. It is very easy to lose your way walking the paths at the hotel. The pool is FANTASTIC. The children loved the waterslide and the fountains in the pool. The quiet pools are very nice and they are open very late at night. My daughter and I used them late at night every night we were there. Word of advice if you are swiming late, bring a towel from your room. They just re-furbished the playground and took out the old chlimbing structure and put in a nice new metal one for the children to play on. We had a car so we did not use the bus service. We took the boat to Down Town Disney a few times. It was nice to not have to worry about parking. There is lots to do at POR. There is an arcade, bicycles, surrey bikes, and water crafts to rent. There is a fishing hole and a scavenger hunt is held for the children on specific days. The Alligator Bayou section is very rustic looking and the rooms have log beds. The rooms are very dark when the blinds are drawn which made it great for my daughter to nap.The Mansion section is a bit more refined and fancy with water fountains etc. The main building has a beautiful lobby , restaurant and bar. The hotel also has a cute little general store where you can purchase just about anything. It is expensive but isnt everything in a hotel store. We loved this hotel. It has a very laidback feel to it. The landscaping is breathtaking. The wildlife (ducks, birds, squirrels, rabbits etc) just sit on the grass and watches you watch it. My daugher loved sitting and watching the rabbits etc in the early morning.

The reception staff where very friendly and pleasent to deal with. The absolute best thing about the resort is that you can skip the bus when going downtown Disney and can take a relaxing boat ride down the Sasagoula river on a riverboat, the boats go back and forth every 10 mins.

I think overall it is definately better than a value resort but the size does bring issues to the table. First let me say that the check-in was very smooth, very fast and they had our room ready before noon. The CM checking us in was knowledegable but not overly friendly. I was so enthusiastic and he did a lot to bring down my excitement. We booked through Disney and asked for the Magnolia Terrace. I requested a standard view room to save some dollars and we got basically a room about as far back as you can go in that particular building. To get to the food court from our room was a chore. The mansion buildings themselves are enormous, bigger than most hotels and just to walk from one end of the building to the other was a workout. Once we covered the expanse of the Magnolia Terrace building we had to go maybe 100 yards to the right, across a sizeable bridge, a long left along the pool area, and across another bridge just to reach the food court. At a good pace this was an 8 minute walk and we were in one of the buildings that is \"close\" to the food court! Some people must have had 20 minute walks from the buildings they were in. The last thing I wanted to do after walking about 10 miles in the theme park was to come back and walk another 8 minutes to get a soda. We bought refillable mugs but it was such a pain to walk to the food court for just that purpose that it may not have been the wisest thing. The good thing about being in the back of Magnolia Terrace was being fairly close to the east depot bus stop. It was a quick 100 yards across the parking lot to get to our bus stop. Before you get excited about that though you must understand that the buses will make 5 stops. One at the French Quarter, and four at Riverside. We were usually the last on (crowded buses at that point) and the last off (a looong ride home from anywhere). We usually didnt wait long for a bus but my oh my what a long ride. It was not zipitty do dah. We found the grounds to be immaculate and pretty much like a picture post card. It was usually quiet and every morning I ventured out before anyone else was up in our room just to marvel at the scenery. The property is very, very nice. The food was pretty decent in the food court which was open until midnight I think. We utilized both the main pool that had a slide and water falls and the basic but very large quiet pool closer to our room. We also did laundry once and they are located at the quiet pools where you can swim or relax while the laundry tumbles itself clean. We took a water taxi once to Downtown Disney but it was sort of a long ride (but pretty) with a full boat of people and yep, you guessed it, we stopped at the French Quarter in route to pick up more people. Needless to say we took it one way and only did it once. Downtown Disney by the way is unbelievably crowded right now. Stay away unless you are bored to death. Riverside has a really nice general store, has lots of activities to do, has a certain southern charm, and has lots of character. The rooms are adequate. Having two sinks is nice, having a curtain for privacy is nice. Having a fridge is nice. The bathrooms are small. The beds are doubles not the queens you would expect when paying this amount of money. The mouse keeping is excellent and accomodated our requests for extra towels, shampoo etc. The air conditioner is either too cold or not cool enough. There are both thick pillows or flat pillows in each room to utilize based on your needs. On getaway day we checked in for our flight in the lobby. They took our bags and that was that. Great service! Magical Express was nice but again, you stop at several properties before getting to your destination. It is included in the price though so that made it bearable. All in all, I liked Riverside better than All-Star Sports and Carribean Beach Resort. I really want to move up to Deluxe to see if it is worth it or not. Those considering this resort should know that the place is huge, you will walk a great deal and yes I know it is a beautiful, serene walk but man my feet were already walked out in the evenings. I would conider staying here again. I would advise anyone to spend the extra bucks by getting a water view room but specifying you want to see the river from Magnolia Terrace. This will put you in a position where the walk to the food court and the walk to the bus stop is moderate in length.

People have written that it's better than a deluxe at a moderate price. I will honestly say you get what you pay for in this case. We are a family of five, two adults and three children. So here goes.... 1. We stayed in Alligator Bayou and the rooms are really, really small and dark. The pull out bed is nothing more than a mattress on wheels without any real bedding. We had to take our comforter off of the double bed and give it to our child because of being cold. The air conditioner options were cold or hot and because the rooms open up to the outside, you had to keep it on cold. The walls are paper-thin and we could hear our neighbors, especially the turbo-flush toilets at all hours of the night. I will say that I read the complaints about housekeeping, thinking people were being picky...wrong on that one. Our room was not clean, even when cleaned. My husband had to shift the nightstand to get something that fell behind it, and the dust bunnies behind it were huge!!! Our room was never vaccumed the 13 nights we were there. The best thing about P.O.R was the staff at the main lobby ...very helpful, very professional. Always willing to be of assistance in any situation. 2. The complaints about the hotel being far away from everything is very, very true. We thought it couldn't be that bad...well if you don't have your own vehicle (which we thankfully did) you are at the mercy of hot, crowded buses. We saw all these guests at the park waiting for the bus in hot, humid weather or rain and thunder looking miserable. This hotel is far from all the parks and other hotels, and therein lies problem #3. 3. The food at Boatwrightsand the Dining Hall was just terrible. Maybe we are just picky because I cook for my family, but part of Disney is the dining experience. You need to consider the average QS meal costs $70 (for 5 people) and the average TS meal cost $150. We added the meal plan and are very thankful we did. We saved $2000 from what we thought we would \"really\" spend before adding the plan!!! After adding up all the meals from the receipts we \"ate\" $3500 of overinflated meals. That's $270 a day! We met a family that didn't do the meal plan, and had a budget of $100 a day for a family of 5. They could only afford lunch. What a shame. Another issue is that if you don't eat at the park or Port Oleans, it's going to take you a good amount of time to make it to the other hotels to eat if you don't have a car. The Polynesian and Animal Lodge have the best food at WDW. 4. You get what you pay for...meaning that there are no little luxuries at P.O.R. I wasn't looking for a deluxe stay and most definitely not a value stay. But this resort leans heavily to the value stay. Not much to do except for the pools, which were terribly crowded. Which leads me to point #5. 5. I know you must be thinking \"Well, I'm not there for the hotel and I will be in the parks all the time.\" This could be true in the off, cool season. NOT during the spring and summer though. One huge, huge problem is the foreign tourists. Our dollar is weak, making their currency strong. I had more Disney employess tell me that March-August is just miserable now because of these groups. It is winter break in the Southern Hemisphere, so you have these tourist groups (from a specific country which I will leave unnamed) of teenagers that take over the parks. I mean 100 teenagers with four chaperones. My children ages 10, 9 and 8 were so tired of being push, poked and run over by these groups, that we had to take a break to the hotel in the afternoons. These groups of hundreds will wipe out Fast Passes faster than you can blink. Do all the \"kiddie\" rides in the morning, because by noon these groups have taken over everything. And that includes the dining facilities at P.O.R. Another problem is that these groups will cut you in line, and claim to understand no English. They only speak Portugese. When you tell them they can't cut in line, you get a dirty look and they push ahead anyway. I know you must be thinking that it can't be that bad and you can stay away from it...Good Luck! These groups use the moderate hotels for their stays. 6. Final point...just because Disney has been a favorite American pasttime doesn't mean it has continued in that direction. We were there to celebrate the Fourth of July. My husband is in the military and we were excited to see the celebration. We stayed on property so that we could get into the Magic Kingdom, but guess what? Hotel guests are never guaranteed park admission on busy days, especially if you don't have the monorail at your resort. (We were told this is a problem at Christmas too, so beware.) Kind of strange if you ask me. So my husband who has been in harm's way in the past for this country, wasn't able to see fireworks on the most Patriotic Day of the year. What a slap in the face from such iconic American company. So in conclusion...I would not stay at the Port Orleans again. Pay the extra $50 and stay at a Deluxe if you want a truly American experience. We have dicussed if we will ever go back to Disney and our suggestions are: *Stay at a Deluxe. *Take the kids out of school and go during the Value Season. *Plan your meals wisely, because most of the food is only good, at best. *Use the Morning Magic Hours. *Plan to spend $500-$1500 over what's in your budget. *Avoid the spring and summer like it's the \"Plague\". *Save all of your patience up for this trip because it's not a vacation in the relaxing sense. It's a fight of the fittest to get through the inconsiderate mobs. *Enjoy!", "Date": "July 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for the price!\u201d", "Author": "oec7516", "ReviewID": "UR17802387", "Content": "This was my first time staying at Disney.

June 4, 2008. If you are reading this... no doubt, you are considering a trip to Disneyworld and are seeking a place to rest your tired heads when you are done with the day. Well... I must say that our trip to Disney with Riverside as our away-from-home-home was most pleasant. I emphasize that point... our trip was awesome. Yet, nobody comes to this site to just read about all the awesomeness that somebody else experienced. Read on... and perhaps your trip can be even more \"Dream-worthy\" than ours. We booked our trip fairly \"Last-minute\" and I didn't have time to research much. If I did... I would have done a couple of things different. 1. Pack a spare set of clothes for everyone in a carry-on bag (including swimsuits). 2. Investigate the \"Meal-plan.\" Ok... About number 2. I don't know much about the \"Meal-plan\" option, but I'm sure others will figure it out if they dig into the Disney Vacation website. I didn't have time to do it, but it might have saved my family some money if I did. The first (and practically the last) I heard of it was when one of the cashiers at the place asked if we were on a \"Meal Plan\" or not. Investigate it... It might save you some money. Back to #1. Pack a thourough carry on. We used the Disney Magical Express service. With that service, you simply make the LONG walk through the Orlando Airport towards the baggage claim... but continue on past baggage claim to the Disney Magical Express counter. At that counter you \"Check-in\" with Disney, then just follow their directions to the bus that takes you to your destination... Ours was Riverside. More on #1. For anyone living in a dryish climate like Colorado, the sight of a swiming pool at your destination while adjusting to the heat and humidity of Florida will cause and unresistable urge to swim... especially if you are travelling with a three year old and a pregnant wife. Your bags however will not arrive with you. They will be faithfully delivered to your room later... in our case 5 hours later at 10:30pm with me and my family wearing towels and/or covered with sheets watching the Disney Chanel on the room tv. Ok... I really didn't mean to dwell on that point.... honestly that was the only downside to the whole experience. The place is big and fairly well spread out. Expect a long walk to the \"Mill\" for all of your meals. Spread out is not a bad thing, though. A long walk to get breakfast for your family in the morning or some yogurt for your little one before bed in this peacefull environ is certainly not a bad thing. Just don't make the mistake of trying to be in a rush. Unlike some places you research on the internet... this place is exactly what it seems like in the pictures and even more. Tranquil and relaxing. The boats in the river, horse-drawn carriges, and water-wheel add to the ambiance in a way that photos don't capture. At mealtime, I suggest finding a table near the gear mechanism just inside the water wheel and windows overlooking the river for some extra interest. There is a big table with tons of Legos, crayons, paper, and a tv with Disney cartoons (of course) near there to keep your little one occupied while you finish your meal in peace. Of course, the place is there to make a buck, though. Expect to pay to rent a boat for a while, ride the horse-drawn carriage, or ride the bike-car-thing around the complex. The food isn't McCheap... but it is solid and will keep you and your family fueled. (I suggest getting one \"big breakfast platter,\" some fruit and a few forks so your family can all share it. Your family will need fuel for the day ahead when you go to the theme parks. The more you fuel up back \"at home\" at the resort the less you will need to answer the call of hunger (and pay the price) for food past the gates in the parks. The place was super clean and everyone was pleasantly cheerful without being cheezy... even the guy working the weed eater down by the river had some pleasant words for us and our 3 year old. The pool was nice and had a little water slide. The lifeguards will kindly tell you \"One at a time\" down the slide if you go down with your kid on your lap, but there are free floatation jackets for kids at the marina if you want to use them at the pool. The transportation to Downtown Disney takes about 30 minutes or so by boat. That was free, but of course there are plenty of ways to spend your money downtown. We hopped on the bus to get back to the resort. After the heat while walking around downtown, we were ready for the air contitioned bus ride. Transportation to all other Disney parks works just as advertized. No need for a rental car here, unless you plan to get off the reservation. I planned on it, but once I got there I decided that I just didn't want to leave. Hmmm... I just got back, so maybe I'm just on that vacation high, but honestly my experience was fairly awesome on the whole. Yeah... it was hot. Hot and humid. Well... its Florida in the summer.

Our first encounter with the staff was perfect in that the woman who helped us was friendly and helpful. Since we arrived at 11:00am, our room was not ready (no surprise). We just grabbed our key, which is also the park pass, checked our carry-on bags with the AMAZING Luggage handlers and went on our merry way to EPCOT. When we returned that evening, everything was in our neat and tidy rooms. We had adjoining rooms in the Aligator Bayou Bldg. 28. The rooms were clean and fresh (no musty smells as some had reported). Housekeeping was good about cleaning the baths, changing towels, and making beds. We had no complaints. One comment I would make about the Bayou is that if you have a stroller, you might want to request the 1st floor since there are no elevators. Every night when arriving back with our son sleeping in the stroller, my husband and I had to carry the two up the steps. Luckily, our stroller is light. The pool, though we only went once during our stay, was nice for our older children and our three year old. There were plenty of chairs and towels available while we visited. The food court was great for breakfast. I especially liked the yogurt bar, my kids enjoyed eggs or pancakes, and my mom had an omlette every morning. We had the basic dining plan, so our breakfast was on us, and we found the prices to be reasonable. The yogurt counted as a snack, and by mid week it was obvious that we had lots of extra snacks, so I put my yogurt on our plan. If there was one concern, it had less to do with Port Orleans than it did with Disney transportation. Yikes!!!!!!!!!! We were sadly disappointed, as were many others. This was our first time on property. In the past, we rented a car, and could come and go at our leisure. This time, we stood waiting for a bus only to often be jammed in with other irritated guests. Not pleasant - let alone \"magical.\" What was maddening was that other resort buses would pull away from the parks with 10 passengers??? I don't know who manages the system, but that person should be re-evaluated. My husband and I thought about how Mr. Walt Disney went to such great extremes to create the perfect experience for his guests - even so far as to build Magic Kingdom above a level of tunnels so that a cast member from Frontierland would not be seen walking through Fantasyland. I am sad to say that our beloved Walt would be horrified to see his guests stuffed onto a bus where the elderly, along with parents holding sleeping children, and toddlers are holding on for dear life after waiting sometimes up to an hour for the experience. With this said, though we enjoyed our stay at Port Orleans, we might consider a resort with better transportation service, or perhaps better yet, renting a car.", "Date": "May 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cGlad We Chose Riverside\u201d", "Author": "LAMOM77", "ReviewID": "UR16394545", "Content": "We just returned from a magical week at Walt Disney World. I stayed at Port Orleans Riverside years ago, but was worried about my stay here years later after reading some of the reviews. Let me say that our experience here was a pleasant one. The Magical Express ride to the resort was great. We practically stepped off the plane and onto the bus with little wait. Check in was easy and the staff was very courteous and answered all my questions. We requested a room in the Magnolia Bend area. These rooms look more like the antebellum mansions rather than rustic log beds found in Alligator Bayou. For the most part our rooms were clean. The sheets were very clean, the bed comfortable. No BED BUGS! The bathroom sinks and tub looked clean. Each day the maid service did a good job cleaning the room and replenishing the towels. The furniture looked a bit worn and scuffed. The baseboards and the bathroom tile looked as if it needed a good scrubbing. I had considered upgrading to the Wilderness Lodge resort shortly before leaving for Orlando. I am glad I did not. We visited the Wilderness Lodge for dinner the first night we arrived. Although the lobby and exterior of the resort was impressive, the same theme reemerged at this resort as well. The true attention to detail and cleanliness I have come to expect when visiting a Disney resort was lacking. When paying $300+ per night I expect perfection! When you consider the cost of the rooms at the Wilderness Lodge compared to those at Port Orleans, I feel that I got a lot more for my money by staying at Riverside. My kids loved the large pool area and slide at the main pool, and our room was also very close to a smaller less crowded pool. We ate breakfast each morning in the food court. The breakfast was great. I recommend adding the dining plan to your vacation package. The grounds at this resort are quite extensive so be prepared to walk to everything- bus, food court, pool, etc. I would definitely plan to stay at this resort again.

It's clear that this is a hotel that caters to families on vacation and not business travelers, so I will consider that in expressing my opinions here. For the vacationer, the Port Orleans has a number of benefits. It's directly on the Disney property, so you get the Disney hospitality and there are transportation options for getting to other parts of the park and property. However, you are not in walking distance to any of the other Disney sites, which means you are reliant on shuttle bus schedules. There are several pools and other recreational options at the Port Orleans property, which is nice for a day outside the park. I thought the price was a big high for what the Port Orleans offered, but I guess you have to expect an upcharge for the Disney brand and the Disney experience. The rooms were decent, for a family vacation it had several nice extras (two sinks instead of one, a privacy curtain that could be drawn between the bath area and the bedroom area, a decent-sized mini-fridge, etc.) and it did have high speed Internet access for business travelers or recreational web surfers. The food was OK, and it was cheaper than I expected for a Disney property. There is a sit-down restaurant and a cafeteria-style dining area as well, so you can balance your needs and your budget. I found it a bit strange that many of the rooms were in buildings that required a fairly significant walk from the main building, I was traveling light but for those with a couple suitcases and no car it could be an awkward and uncomfortable walk to your room...I did see several resort golf-carts cruising the grounds, but I didn't see any guests on them nor did I see anyone offer this help to a guest. All in all, I would say that there are better options for a family vacation at DisneyWorld, but this is fine option for a family with a little bit of energy and patience. For the business traveler, I would recommend looking at other properties that cater more to this audience segment.", "Date": "May 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, NY", "Title": "\u201cNice, but not perfect\u201d", "Author": "ArgyleJoshTaylor", "ReviewID": "UR16058747", "Content": "We stayed 6 nights and generally had a great time. There is nothing drastically wrong with this resort and the criticisms I will mention are not going to ruin your stay; they just outline the difference between the moderate and deluxe hotels at WDW. First and most annoying, the only way to get anywhere is by bus. Yes, there is a water launch to Downtown Disney, but because of wake restrictions, it is like a slow boat to China. So buses are the primary mode of transport. They run frequently, but it seems if they have more than one stop, the stop you want is always down the list. Tuesday morning we took the Downtown Disney bus to go shopping. But we had to stop at Typhoon Lagoon first. On the way back, another stop at Typhoon Lagoon. Later that morning we decided to go to Typhoon Lagoon, but this bus went to Downtown Disney first. ARGH!. Aside from the potential crowds on the buses, the worst part is the music they play, which is computer programmed by the route you are on. The Port Orleans music starts out with a good 6 minutes of a duet of banjos and crickets. Then a [--] rendition of One by U2. Then one or two other songs and it starts over. Unless an announcement is made and the whole banjo hell thing starts from the beginning. ARGH! Have these people not heard of an Ipod? The theme of the old south is done just fine. But looking at the landscaping closely makes you realize they are not manicuring it the way they might at Grand Floridian. We had the Deluxe Dining plan. The restaurants at Riverside are nice, although a bit on the loud side. The dining plan lets you eat at over 100 different restaurants, including those at other resorts. The problem is there is no way to get easily between resorts. You always have to take at least two buses. This gets tedious. One night we tried the water launch to Downtown Disney and then the other water launch to Old Key West for dinner. We really like the restaurant, but it took over 40 minutes to travel the approximate mile between the resorts. ARGH! The room itself was fine. The resort is getting a bit long in the tooth, but has been kept up right along so nothing was particularly worn out. The room had a ceiling fan, a refrigerator and a safe. The resort has one main swimming pool, but the best kept secrets for adult parties are the other 6 pools scattered about. They are much quieter. The gift shop was large and had everything from Mickey Mouse shirts and ice cube trays to Advil and bourbon. Overall not a bad value for the price, but if you can swing a hotel on the monorail line or even Wilderness Lodge with a short boat ride to the Magic Kingdom, you will find it far more convenient to get around.", "Date": "May 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cJust Terrific!!!\u201d", "Author": "nyrhky94", "ReviewID": "UR15999645", "Content": "My family and I stayed 6 nights at Port Orleans Riverside during April school break, along with several other families from our town/area. Our daughter's dance company was performing at the Magic Kingdom during that week. As this was a large group travel situation, a travel agent coordinated the entire trip for us. Our stay at Port Orleans Riverside was just terrific!!! The grounds are absolutely beautiful and very well maintained. We were located in the Alligator Bayou section of the resort, which we loved. The lush grounds and meandering paths made for very pleasant walks to the pools, main dining house & bus stops of the resort. I know some folks don't care for the \"longish\" walks involved in staying here, but we rather enjoyed them. Given the amount of park food we were consuming during the week, we actually looked forward to the walks as part our daily exercise. The whole river/bayou layout & theme was just great. It really felt like you were living that type of lifestyle while you were there. Service at the front desk and elsewhere around the resort was excellent. The rooms were cleaned promptly every day and were just fine for their intended purpose (a place to sleep/crash). The 4 of us slept fine in the two queen beds, but my son also put the spare trundle bed to use on a couple of those nights. We did a 4-day park hopper while down there and had no real issues with the buses. Sometimes the wait was a bit longer than others, but generally the wait times were not that bad at all. A really nice benefit of staying at Riverside is the free water taxi (boat) to Downtown Disney. We found that to be a nice relaxing way to get there and used it several times. Learning about the Disney tree house villas along the river was kind of neat. As far as food goes, we were happy with the overall dining experience. While the main dining hall area gets quite busy in the morning as folks get ready to go to the parks, there was always an open table and the food lines moved along at a decent pace. Our favorite breakfast was the omelet station. A ton of ingredient choices and a hearty portion for a decent price. The guy making the omelets (4 at a time) was fun to watch. The other food stations were good as well for both lunch & dinner. And the desert station had a nice selection of goodies. Lastly, the drink refill cups that we bought on our first day was a very good value. Over the course of our stay, we got all of our money back & more on all the fountain drinks, juices, water etc. Overall, I would have to say that if you're looking for a good family value (i.e. moderate Disney resort), Port Orleans Riverside is a great way to go. From the lush, well maintianed grounds to the \"realistic\" look & feel of being in a river/bayou setting, this is a great place to stay with the kids (mine were even older) while \"park hopping\" at WDW. I would highly recommend it to others and would go back there again on our next visit without hesitation.

We would recommend this hotel for short stays but we stayed for 14 nights and that was far too long. The rooms were big but not the beds for two adults used to a double bed in England this felt bit small. Regardless of previous reviews we found it to be clean and well kept. The grounds are amazing, We would recommend a walk along the river at about 7:15 to 7:30 am when the water is very still and the reflections are wonderful, you may also be lucky to see the otters hunting for food they come right up on the bank with there catch of the day. The rooms are very dark and you will need the lights on regardless of the time of day. Also the air conditioning noise came to be very irritating. The main pool is noisey at all times the music goes on late into the night and people swin until at least midnight, we were lucky to be a little way away and the quiet pools are worth visiting. Disney Transport is good, if you want an excellent night out book the Hoop de Do show at the Fort wilderness campground, Buckets of ribs and Chicken and great entertainment..Go on the bus to Magic Kingdom and get a boat from there to the campground, this in its self is a great boat trip, there are buses straight from the campground home but don't take too long about getting to them. The Aloha dinner show was also good but if you can only go to one then go to Hoop de do. Food at Riverside is not brilliant, not much choice and seemed mostly to be buggers and chips. But the French Quarter does a great Taco salad and for a smaller quieter restaurant seemed to have more choice well worth the walk down the riverside. Overall we enjoyed our stay but were thoroughly all themed out by the end, relaxation and peace and quiet seemed to be hard to come by in disney. Other trips worth a visit are the Kennedy Space Centre (Which was really really excellent).

Myself, hubby and 5 year old son. We loved this resort. Although we have nothing to compare it to because it's our first trip to Disney but I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Next time we may try somewhere different just to see what other resorts are like but it's not because we had any problems at all at this resort. The only rude person I ran into during my vacation was the guy working with Disney who was working at the airport. We used the yellow Disney tags on our luggage but I was still a little nervous about leaving our luggage for the Disney people to pick up and expressed this to the 'gentleman'. He was extremely rude to me when I expressed my concerns. We did in fact hop on the Disney express and trusted the Disney staff to get our luggage to our room safely...and they did! So we get to the resort after a comfy ride on the Disney bus. We were second in line to check in, therefore we didn't have to wait at all. We had paid for a 'preferred location' when we booked our trip assuming this meant we would be located in a building near the main pool and main building which housed the restaurant, food court and store. But a preferred location just means a water view...either the river or a pool. Next time we won't pay the extra cost for a preferred location because we were not in the room long enough to care much about the view. We did request a building near the main building and the lady working on the front desk did get us into the Acadian House...which is pretty close. So if you don't really care about the view, don't pay for a preferred location. If you want a building close to the main areas, just request it when you check-in. And guess what? It was approximately 1:00 pm and the room was ready! We went to our room, changed into our swim clothes that we had in our carry-ons and headed for the pool. When we came back to our room perhaps 2 hours later our luggage was sitting there. The room was quite clean. The bed was one of the comfiest beds I've ever slept in! My son slept better than he does at home...but that may be because he was exhausted after our busy days at the theme parks! The lady who cleaned our room didn't do the towel art thing but each day she did do cute things with my son's MANY stuffed animals and he really enjoyed coming back to our room each evening to find what she had done. The resort is beautiful...very large but beautiful. We never heard any noise at all from the outside when we were in our room. I don't even know if we had neighbours because it was so quiet. The food court at breakfast time was crazy!!! The food was pretty good and we enjoyed having our breakfast outside each morning before we started our busy day. Used the bus system and had no problems. But if you watch the fireworks at Magic Kingdom just remember that after the fireworks are over the park closes and EVERYONE is heading for the busses! More than once my husband had to carry our son to the bus depots and wait extra long for a bus....and then we were lucky to get a seat. Most men are very polite and will give up their seat for women and children. My hubby hardly ever got to sit down....'cause he's one of the nice ones! Other than that I highly recommend using the bus service to the theme parks. The store at the resort has everything you need that's Disney related. That's where I did most of my shopping and it was great. We did buy a few grocery items and found that they were quite costly but you have to expect that I guess. There is an arcade at the resort that my son loved. The pool was a lot of fun and he loved the water slide. The quiet pool was nice as well. Loved seeing the little lizards, squirrels and rabbits that seemed to be everywhere. My son even loved feeding the fish in the river. Found our room to be kept pretty clean each day and noticed the staff doing painting and upkeep all around the resort. I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. I called the front desk several times to ask various questions about locations of things, etc. and they were always able to give me answers.....never an 'I don't know'. The room wasn't perfect but it suited us just fine and I highly recommend this resort. It is a very busy resort but I believe the reason for that is because it has a reputation of being the best moderate resort that is owned by Disney. My husband really enjoyed the steak at Boatwrights. The desserts at the food court, ie; the carrot cake and cheese cake are fabulous!

Yes, I saw some of the things people talked about, but we'll get to that later. To me, its mostly funny stuff and all part of the Disney (sightseeing) vacation, note: Sightseeing does not equal relaxation, and this week was a marathon of sights. We started our trek with our three kids, took the Disney magical express from the aiport, Went right downstairs and was checked in by a cast member in 2 seconds. First question? Did I see any any cast members up in the main airport to help me down here? NO, none at all !!! But one really helpful security lady helped me find it, very easy too.. Next, no wait for the Magic Bus, but for some reason, the magic express bus going to Riverside was not the yellow and blue bus with Travelin-Mickey on the hood and the side. I thought to myself - uh oh ! not a good sign. But it was just as comfy with the movies and everything, funny driver made a joke about having two hours to now pray for our luggage to make it to our room. Got to Riverside, very grand entrance way, lots of people already vacationed-up, shopping, waiting for cruise-line buses and park buses. Off we go to the lobby, about 1pm, only 2 people in line, im the second. Kids immediately spot Crayons and paper and the TV, then spot the Riverside boat and other boats at the Marina right outside the window, their pretty excited and I cant wait to stroll around. Very nice place. One thing people havent written about that is absolutely the coolest thing about Disney to me is: There is Mood-setting MUSIC playing in each place you go. So the lobby has some nice trumpets playing, I felt all steam-boated up... Checked in in 5 minutes, only problem, room is not ready, have to call from house phone more towards 3pm to see when ready. I asked for a different room, she checked and said, this waterfront room is for you, there is some other room but it is further back. Waterfront can be a Pool View or a river view, She told me we would have a pool view which at first I wasnt that thrilled about. Noticed: People at checkin are dressed up and the concierge people are even more dressed up in some bonnet type get ups. Everyones hungry, so we set off to the food court, which is not too crowded, but is built for at least a thousand people (which we see tommorrow at breakfast). Have a good selection of food and immediately we use 5 quick service meals off our dining. Sat next to the awesome water-wheel which is just nice. Noticed: Tables were like sticky from Syrup or something, this does bug me out, so I went over and wet a few napkins and cleaned it myself, I saw some people during the week making the bus service people clean it up for them. Noticed: The bus service people and the cafeteria people are dressed up in these bonnet type suits too !!! There is a lot of attention paid to the whole theming of the resort, the more you look around, the more you see. We quickly bought two mugs to refill for the whole week, a 12.00 investment that pays off in hours. Ok, went to Ol man Island pool, again, music is playing from the landscaping, and now I really feel relaxed already. This time its more of like rag-time, happy go lucky bayou river music. Wife has a Pina-Colava(raspberry twist) and I have a Mai-Tai, which become the daily routine, kids jump in the pool, hit the slides. I ran to see if the room was ready at 3:00pm, man advises, No, their painting the door ? I said I hope its the outside of the door, because Im not into smelling paint. he said yes its only the outside, should be ready by 4:00pm. Im kind of bummed out because I wanted to hit a park that night, which by the pool are the park open-close times which I notice most of the parks close at 7:00pm to 8:30pm. I was shocked about that. Is april not full swing ? So anyway, killing one more hour at a pool is not really a problem. I go back at 3:50, and the room is ready, Im given the Room# now, it was a secret until then, Its Alligator Bayou # 3906, Let me tell ya, Im very glad we waited for this room, after making a few wrong turns, we came upon our room, 1st floor and literally 30 steps from one of the quiet pools. In fact we can see the pool from our window !!! Score !!!! on the way there, we see all sorts of towel animals and displays in peoples room windows. We already have an Elephant waiting for us in the window ! We were in the room no more than 1 minute and PooF our Luggage appears which was not really a surprise considering it was here already for three hours just like us. But we happily tipped the guy ! Two other things I know that Disney knows how to do, When the AC is running, and you sit outside, you can not hardly even hear it. It is the quietest unit Ive ever heard, It cranked, we never had to turn it on to hi-cool, and kept it only on 5-1/2 (out of 10) on lo-cool all the time, 6 was too cold ! And then, they have the best pillows in the world, they are really small, you think you need two, but when you use just one, it like explodes around your head and it feels like theres three, no matter how you turn it, you have just the right support. There are plenty of shelves, one over the two sinks, held all of our stuff for all 5 of us. There is a nice marble shelf near the tub, mirror on the bathroom door, nice touch for kids because they cant see them selves in the over-sink mirrors. There is a nice armoir with a big tv, lots of drawers. A shelf with 6 hanging pegs which I used to keep all my Park Maps, cell phone, money, watch, its up high and worked out nice. A big trunk thing that held one of our suitcases. The beds have wooden posts that are great for hanging hats, jackets and things. There was a big table and two chairs. The window had nice wood blinds that closed up nice and nice thick room-darkening curtains. We are just totally impressed by the room, it looks just like the Wilderness lodge we were in two years ago. Im so happy about the pool location. I guess if I was a real complainer, I could say there was a pink-milk of magnesia type stain on the floor near the corner of the refrigerator. But who cares about that ? I got bigger things to worry about. Like how much fun Im going to be having all week. The refrigerator was cool and helped alot with milk for the kids. We wanted a micro-wave, so I called for one, they have them, but they must have a limited number and asked if we needed it for medical reasons, I said, yes, my children need warm food and drinks, that did the trick, we had it in two hours. So now we were set, un-packed watching the Disney tour channel. We set off to Epcot the first night just to get out. We could hit the North bus-stop in a pretty fast 5 minute walk. The grounds like everyone says are just awesome, little ponds, bridges, turning sidewalks, lush gardens, Oh yeah, we had a bunny rabbit lived near our house, we saw her everyday. And plenty of lizards, ducks and assorted birds. Just a real paradise. One thing I want to mention is: Dont think that Disney has not put millions into this resort and maintains it very well. Every one is on the ball ! After some peoples reviews, you would think the place is falling apart, absolutely not true. Oh yeah, remember the painting of the door ? No one painted anything near this room. He must have been drinking some Mai-Tai's. I wasnt about to make sure any thing about the painting either. So when we got back to the room that night, the beds are pretty high up in the air. It would not be good to fall out from that height, so I ordered bed-rails. This was later in the evening, and we did not receive them the first night. We passed out without them anyway and I called in the morning, and told them we asked for them last night, she apologized and we had them in our room in 20 minutes. Thats good service. Our first official day was about to start, we head off to the food court, wow ! its packed ! We quickly came up with a plan we did every morning. We all spot the table, grab it. Wife goes and gets the food. Pancakes, bacon, eggs every day, awesome ! I settle the kids at the table, fill the mugs with coffee, get the knives/forks/napkins, and get the syrup. Note You need a knike to stir the coffee in the mug, the coffee stirrers are not tall enough for the mug. We have this down to a science, and the kids are at their best at breakfast, we have a great time watching all of the people so happy to be at Disney. Everyone is very courteous, polite and helpful, holding doors, etc... The only time all week I saw anything remotely problematic was with some bad mouthed teenagers, hey but what are you gonna do ? their teenagers ! The buses ? your curious about them right ? well, I saw it all, mostly they were always there and ready within 5 or 10 minutes, I had a few times of over 30 minutes, and one really bad time where it was 50 minutes. I watched the time like a hawk, but the majority of the time, it was only 10 minutes. and Yes, I did stand a few times, but im a guy, and my wife sat everytime as did my kids, people would go way out of their way to stand for a lady, an elder or the kids ! It was actually very nice to see such nice people. I love America, we're the best people ! And the toilets ? Yes ! they're loud !! its like a suction -explosion just like everyone says, but I couldnt really hear other rooms toilets like some people say. I was actually laughing to myself because I remember the toilet noise problem ! haha ! Do the dining, and make sure you try to get reservations, we had only one when we left from home: At BoatWrights, I ended up making another one at BoatWrights, and we got a reservations at: Tuskar House in Animal Kingdom, Mama Melrose in Holly wood studioes, Liberty TreetTavern in Magic Kingdom, and do believe!!!!!!!!!!! we got a reservation at Cinderellas Round Table Sunday Morning for Monday Night, dont give up, just call every morning. People really do cancel, it happened for us last time, and it happened for us again this time !!! Boatwrights I couldnt say more about, I was more relaxed there than at cinderellas castle. Just like Cinderellas castle has these pretzel appetizer rolls, Boatwrights has fresh corn bread with real corn for appetizers, also got the romain lettuce with parmesan and the spiced shrimp. Then got an excellent Filet mignon. You have to get the top shelf things at the top shelf restaurants because with Disney dining, 1 table service is 1 table service no matter where you eat, so get to the nice places and order up the most expensive stuff. So glad we really ate well all week. Still had 10 snacks after 6 days. Well we put a whole lot of blisters onto our feet, each day we had a new towel display in our bath room, one day it was a dress shirt and tie, next day it was a sea shell, all of our toothbrushes where spread in different patterns, There was always something to see when we got back to the room. And the kids got a Bunny one day, and on the next to last day they got a kangaroo ! so the Elephant, bunny, kangaroo and a bunch of toys were all looking out the window. We never got to do the fishing hole or rent the surrey bike. But we saw people everyday fishing and biking, We did take the Horse and carriage ride on our last night after another fantastic meal at boatwrights. Luke was our horses name, almost 2,000 pounds he is, a really beauty. We went down to the french quarter as the sun was setting, the kids first time in a buggy, it was just surreal. Very beatiful. We took the boat to downtown disney which was very relaxing and also beautiful, you can put the strollers right up into the front of the boat and just relax. We also took the boat on our last day to the French Quarter swimming pool because the kids just HAD to go down the Dragon Tongue Slide ! Oh yeah ! The gift shop at riverside is gigantic, we saw a lot of the things that were in the parks were also available right here in the Hotel gift shop. We also bought stuff in the parks, and they shipped to the hotel gift shop for free! it was there the next day, we did that twice, really worked out great. I was just totally relaxed by the day we had to leave and really comfortable with Riverside, the Magic Express arrived like clockwork, and we checked in for our airline right at the hotel, took 5 minutes. I wish we didnt have to leave, couldve stayed another few days. I hope people remember Disney has done alot with Riverside to make it a great place for anyone, couples, families, tours. If your reading reviews and are thinking - uh oh ! that doesnt sound nice. Remember this, I read them and thought the same thing, and unless im just not a nit-picking party pooper, I just totally had a blast there. I would go back in a second. Its a paradise waiting for you to explore it.

The grounds are really well done. The atmosphere outside really was wonderful. Water taxi to Downtown Disney was very enjoyable and convenient. The resort was quiet - the pool is on an island away from the guest buildings. We had a room that looked back at the parking lots. A little bit of a bummer if the room view is important. Try to get one facing the river side, otherwise you could be staying anywhere with a parking lot view. The room itself was a typical budget-style room. Ours was little tired, but tidy. The handicapped shower and bathroom were well laid out (neither of us is handicapped, but we have a wheelchair bound parent). The shower curtain rings in our room were of a style that were difficult to slide, particularly if you are sitting. The bathroom fan was wicked loud and randomly timed, it seemed. However the bed was comfortable and the sheets were, too. The pillows are puffy and compress down to nothing. My Kaymed pillow it wasn't. :-) The room had a small fridge to store food, beverages, or refrigerated medication. Check-in service was fine. Check-out was easy (we used the Magical Express - I highly recommend it going between airport and resorts). The restaurant, Riverside Mill serves typical cafeteria food. The Nescafe coffee is horrible. It's huge and gets very crowded. My local hole-in-the-wall diner serves better eggs for half the price. It's pretty much the same breakfast everywhere and gets tired, quickly - especially at $7 for scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, and potato wedges. If getting an early seat on a bus to one of the parks is important, I recommend getting a room near the west depot. The south depot (near the main entrance) is always most crowded and is arrived at after the other depots. Coming back from a park, we got off at the south depot and walked to our room through the pleasant grounds. Staying within the Disney grounds has definite transportation advantages. However, Riverside drop-offs and pick-ups seemed to be further away than most and definitely much more populated. For the handicapped: the buses all kneel and accommodate scooters and wheelchairs. The bus driver will let you on first, closing the front doors until you are situated. On return trips from parks, you are allowed and encouraged to move to the head of line, bypassing substantial lines. The \"general store\" is decent. The big store in Downtown Disney has better prices for Disney gear. If wanting to have a beer (and all of it is pretty mainstream), it is better to spend $17 for a six-pack of Corona or Bud Light than $5-$7 for a bottle or a glass of beer.

We ended up in Parterre Place, but when I called the front desk, they promptly provided a rollaway cot that met our needs. Otherwise the room was quiet and housekeeping provided adequate service. Rooms have a refrigerator so you can pick up some milk, juice, yogurt, etc. if you want to eat a quick breakfast in the room. The resort property more that made up for the average room. The grounds are beautiful and our boys absolutely loved the pools, particularly the main pool with the slide. The lifeguard staff at the main pool are very attentive, so parents can relax a bit and let the kids have some fun without having to keep a constant eye on them. Main dining hall is busy, but we were satisfied with the food in general. Staff were very helpful in sorting out the details for the Disney Dining Plan (I highly recommend the plan). Had breakfast there a couple of days and also picked up a pizza one night when we just wanted a quick meal. Also, you can buy mugs for $13.75 that allow for unlimited coffee/soft drink refills at the resort for the duration of your stay. If you are staying more than a few days, they are a great deal considering you can get your coffee and cool drinks for pool time each day. Was somewhat skeptical about how much more convenient it would be to stay on the resort as opposed to in Kissimmee, but am now definitely sold on the value.

After waiting 30 Mins my boyfriend phoned reception to see if it would really be 4 hours waiting for our luggage, They explained yes it would be, Within 5 mins of this conversation there was a knock at the door and a young guy brought our suitcases straight in!! I could not have been happier!! The rooms were extremely clean and tidy and every morning our maid would leave clean towels! To be honest when you are in orlando you dont really spend much time in your hotel room as there is so much to see and do!! However the swimming pool was really clean, There was even a llaundry room!!

A bayou is a name for a small slow moving creek that originated in Louisiana and this landscape is evident if you spend any amount of time walking about the lavish landscape which is particularly pleasant in the evening when the heat has dissipated and there is a warm perfume emanating from the gardenia bushes speckled beside the sidewalks. The Ol' Man Island is the largest swimming pool in the resort. It has a slide which is popular with the kids and a poolside bar popular with the big people. There are five other pools which are spread out in close proximity to the other lodges. There is a full A La Carte restaurant and a self service restaurant which provided adequate eateries and free soda and coffee refills after an initial minimal deposit and a shop, arcade and indoor bars populated by the crowds who were there during our visit.

We were a short distance from the pool and didn't get much noise from there. Our room was pretty good. The tub, shower and toilet areas were clean. The carpets were worn but OK. The two pedestal sinks were great and made getting ready much faster and easier in the mornings.

The food court is open until midnight to accomodate everyon's schedule and eating habits. The cons: the rooms were somewhat clean, but in a very superficial way. I never felt that the room was truly clean. The carpets were stained, and we saw a dead cockroach on the room refrigerator. Also, the air conditioner didn't seem to be that effective. The rooms can be a bit of a walk from the lobby area, and not easy to find when arriving at night. The bathroom areas are extremely small. The food court was okay, certainly nothing special.

I stayed at the Pop Century in October 2007, and stayed at the Port Orleans Riverside March 2-8th. I enjoyed the Pop very much and thougth it was a tremendous value. I decided to upgrade this time and spent an extra $100/night to stay at POR, which is a moderate resort. I thought POR was nice, but not worth the extra $100/night over the Pop. POR has a nice southern theme. The rooms are slightly bigger than the Pop with double sinks and a refrigerator. POR has a boat that does to Downtown Disney which was OK and nice for strollers. The POR property was very big and my family and I did talk a walk around the river, down to French Quarter. We did think taking one of those family bycles or carrige rides would be fun but we really didn't have time to do it. I thought the pools were really great. They were heated and open until 12am. The main pool had a nice bar that opened up at 11:30am and onece I got a $8 Mai Tai that was good. I thought the food court wasn't that great and better at the POP. I gave up on the food court for breakfast and ate at Boatwrights for breakfast which was very good. I had the bannan and strawberry stuffed french toast which was so great. One morning I also had a mimosa to start the day for $11. Again, expensive, but it was fun and I enoyed it. I was at building 18 of POR and it was a quick walk to the main building and I paid for a water view, which meant I got a view of one of the smaller pools. The smaller pools were also heated and open until 12am. I paid for a water view hoping to get a view of the river. We called the front desk to see if they had any river view rooms and they did but I didn't want to relocate. That's OK. Bus times between POR and POP are about the same. I thought the bus queue situation at POP was handled better. POR is not \"In your face\" Disney where the POP is. At any rate I thought POR was nice but not worth the extra money over the POP century. My wife actually commented thatt she missed the whimsical theming of the POP. A week stay at POR was $3300, and the same package was $2600 at the POP. If you are booking a similar vacation, I recommend keeping the $700 in your savings account and going with the POP. We did the dining plan (highly recommend) and if you are too and love to eat your way through a vacation here is some input for you: Boatwright (Port Orleans Riverside) - ate breakfast there 3 times during my stay and thought it was very good. Boma (Animal Kingdom Lodge) - very good, but you must be a little adventurous! Whispering Canyon Cafe (Wilderness Lodge) - very good and get the BBQ skillet--all you an eat and includes a bottomless milkshake! La Cellier (Epcot Canadian Pavillion) - PHENOMINAL, don't miss this if you can get reservations. This is amazing it is only a 1 table service restaurant. 1900 Park Fare (Grand Floridian) - food is pretty unimpressive, but the show they put on with Cinerella, Prince Charming the stepmother, stepsisters is really very nice. I don't recommend having a birthday here though. We spent $60 on a special cake from the Grand Floridan bakery to celebrate a birthday and the waitress forgot it before handing us our check. What a bummer. I wouldn't recommend this place. Chef's de France (Epcot French Pavillion) - food was so-so which was suprising. I woudln't recommend it. Biergarten (Epcot German pavillion) - really great food, and you can order one of those huge german bears. Enjoyed the Oktoberfest band that plays every hour. Highly recommend this place. Liberytree Tavern (Magic Kingdom) - really good. There is nothing on the menu to choose, it just comes to you family style. Well done, tasty Thanksgiving style food.

Riverside was a major disappointment! While no one argues that the grounds aren't beautiful (they are), I expect a lot more from a room. Our first room, in Acadian House, was simply disgusting. There was blood on the toilet and brown substance (hopefully coffee, but maybe not) on the walls. That night, very large groups of apparently unsupervised teenagers ran around screaming and throwing things off of balconies. We called security, and about an hour later they stopped. Then they began slamming the heavy metal door above us and stomping on the floor (they must have seen us look outside before security showed up). After security showed up again, they stopped until around 2:30. At 7am, I dragged myself to the front desk to complain. The staff was very apologetic, and offered a very honest complaint about Brazilian teenage tour groups. They moved our room to Alligator Bayou. Compared to the first room, it seemed nice (at least it was clean). However, the trundle bed was a joke - barely big enough for my six year old, and having him sleep basically on the floor with dirty carpet was a big concern. The beds were incredibly noisy. Any movement at all would wake up everyone in the room. When other toilets would flush, they sounded like torpedos being lauched. For three days, we didn't hear anything from our neighbors (we were on the corner), but then a family with two little girls moved in, and I doubt that we could have heard them better if they had shared our room with us. In the other two moderate resorts, we never heard another guest. Another reviewer commented on \"crabby\" guests. We experienced that too. When entering the overcrowded dining room, absolutely no one held the door open for other guests carrying luggage or food, or said \"thank you\" if we did. All in all, there was nothing \"magical\" about this stay (although we did enjoy the parks). Buses weren't bad, except for Sunday to the Magic Kingdom. The line for the bus was so long that we rode the water taxi to the French Quarter and got a bus from there. When I read things that other reviewers post, like \"if this were a European hotel it would be 4 stars\", I have to point out that it's not a European hotel! It's a Disney hotel, and you have a right to expect better quality for $185.

The waterways, pools, foliage, and architecture provided a photogenic spot in any direction I looked, and romantic strolls along the paved walkway were easily had.

We were able to book through a friend who is a castmember for Disney, so we received a discounted rate. That was a huge money saver for us, as we soon realized, as always, that Disney World is also known as \"Spend Lots of Money World.\" This was my 6th trip to Disney, first to Riverside. The resort was beautiful- had beautiful grounds and there were always people powerwashing and groundskeeping to make everything look nice. The rooms were moderately nice. I have stayed at the value resorts twice and Riverwide was a step up- but not a huge one. I think I was expecting a little more elegance for the stated 185 per night rate. Everything was very clean. We had our little towel animals upon arrival. Did not receive anymore through the duration of our stay, but we are both adults with no children so they probably thought we didn't need them :) Housekeeping was kind and considerate each day, as we both slept in until 10. They always did a great job. The fridge was a very nice size and was a convenience to us. The bed was comfortable- we got a king room. Sinks and bath were both nice and worked just fine! The food court was always extremely busy in the AM, until around noon. For lunch and supper it was usually pretty vacant. There were many crabby patrons- kids and adults included. The food court staff were also more crabby than I remember Disney staff being, but we found that throughout our entire Disney experience. I no longer say that Disney World is the happiest place on earth- times are changing I guess. The food was alright- not many choices but that is to be expected. I'm guessing most of the moderate and value resort food courts are the same with choices. The resort is very large but manageable if you are ok with walking. We stayed in the Acadian house and it was about a 3 minute walk to the food court. We had a nice and quiet pool right next to our house, but the walk to the busier pool was about 3 minutes as well. If you have kids- bring your strollers! Transportation was alright as Disney transport goes. We did not use Magical Express but we did use the buses and the boats to get to various parks. Never had to wait very long but the rides themselves seem to take forever. We were glad to have a rental car for those times that we didn't want to sit on the bus. Riverside is also slightly further away than the deluxe resorts, so transport time is longer. Overall, Riverside was a fine resort. We will not stay there again though.

Arrived at Orlando International at about 5pm (flying Virgin) and collected luggage. Walked a few yards through the exit doors and the luggage was taken off us for delivery to the hotel, as all guests at this property qualify for the Disney Magical Express Service. We were directed to the basement level of the terminal where after a brief check of our tickets we were put on a free coach to the hotel. This took about 25 minutes journey time. On arrival at the hotel, check-in was very fast, you are given the option to leave a credit card to be able to charge anything you purchase(at any Disney Park/Resort) to your room, but this is optional. The rooms are very spread out over the resort, we were allocated a room in the Alligator Bayou section - about 5 mins walk from the lobby area. The room was more than adequate in size, very clean and tastefully decorated. There was a refrigerator in the room, and a wall safe although this was on the small side and not suitable for large cameras or laptops. The room was serviced daily, usually with a small surprise left for the kids. The only thing that caused a small annoyance was when we needed internet access. The rooms have a wired connection available at $9-95 per day, however we were having problems connecting, which took 2 days for their tech team to resolve and apparently they do not allow guests to access their Wi-fi at the lobby area. The resort seems very quiet and peaceful despite the large numbers of guests staying there. There was no smoking in any rooms and smoking was only permitted in designated areas however these are reasonably spread over the resort and within a short walk from any room. The main pool area has hot-tubs and a bar area serving drinks and snacks, and life-guards on duty. There are also smaller pools dotted about the resort, these have no-one on duty and tend to be almost deserted, however perfect for a relaxing, undisturbed swim. We were not on any dining plan and purchased a few meals and snacks from the food court, the food there is rather basic fare and pretty much what you'd get at any shopping mall food court. Most meals cost less than $8 and much less for children. One thing that was great value was the refillable drink cups that we purchased on arrival at the food court. They cost about $12 each but can be refilled from the drinks station as often as you wish during your stay and do save a lot of money in the long run. There was also a large gift shop at the hotel selling souvenirs and basic food items at a reasonable price. We had a ten day Disney Park ticket and used the free hotel shuttle service every day. I could not fault this service - the buses ran to all the Disney Parks every 20 mins and also to Downtown Disney. There were 3 bus stops servicing this resort and the maximum we had to wait was about 15 minutes. They did not stop at any other resort and we were at the park gates within 15 minutes. They also run a free boat shuttle to/from Downtown Disney until 11-30 at night. The park shuttles ran til an hour after park closing and continued to run during the extra magic hours available to Disney Resort guests. On return to the airport, a phone call to bell services got the luggage collected, and again a courtesy coach provided travel to the airport.

One examaple was I tried to ship some documents and was instructed \"the front desk could accommodate any of my needs\" by the hotel staff. But upon bringing my documents to the front desk I was instructed to go into the gift shop and ask for a box. I then was given a large Desani water bottle box to ship my documents. (The box has vent holes and was taped on the bottom with masking tape and had obviously been wet at some time in the past and was much too large for my documents I needed to send.) I was then told that the front desk would have newspaper to pack the box with. I asked the woman at the gift shop whether she could ship the documents due to she was packing up several things and shipping them directly from the gift shop. She said, \"we can only ship Disney merchandise.\" I then went back up to the front desk with my unraveled box.

The room smelled fresh and appeared clean but there were a few stains on the carpet and the bathroom floor tile although swept, did not look clean. After the first day our cleaning person stopped leaving clean cups and became very lax about cleaning the room. We had pizza in the room our first night and snack just about every other night and the same crumbs remained on the floor for the entire time we were there. Also, the air conditioner did not work well. It would only run for about thirty minutes at a time. Luckily it was not very hot but it still made the room uncomfortable at times. Final analysis is that although the resort grounds and amenities are nice, the room is lacking enough so that next time we go to Disney World we will look into Hotels off the Disney World property. For what they charge, I am not impressed.", "Date": "March 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canandaigua, NY", "Title": "\u201cDirty and they didn't care!!!\u201d", "Author": "CanandaiguaTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR13866768", "Content": "We spent 7 nights at Port Orleans Riverside in Bdg 25.

The pillows arrived in a plastic bag with the pillow cases next to them. Not the Disney Experiance I expected. The room carpet was torn. The bath tub had mold on the walls. The bathroom ceiling had a red stain on it. The showerhead had some sort of orange buildup all over it. The sheets did not fit the bed. One of the bedframes was cracked and made noise everytime the kids rolled over. The ironing board pad was black! On day 2 the maid never changed the ice bag and left it full of water. They also never swept the floor. I know this because I dropped a small plactic pice of a braclett on the floor late the night before. This little piece of plastic stayed on the floor, in clear view, for 4 straight days. I thought it was a simple oversignt. The next day I left it on the sink with the ripped bag. The bag was gone without a replacement and the floor was not swept. That night I called the front desk to speak with a manager about the issues. I was told that no manager was available. The lady that answered the phone took all of my information and said she would take care of it. Next day no change. Called the desk for a manager again and got to speak with Ann (Anna?) who stated she was the manager on duty. She appoligized up one side and down the other and promised the room would be cleaned and the problems corrected. Guess what, next day the problems were still there (and of course no ice bag which is now a shopping bag full of water). I called and asked for a manager and again was told that no manager was available. I was transfered to housekeeping. I requested to speak with the resort manager. After a 10 minute wait I was put into his voicemail. I left a very detailed message about the ongoing problems. Within a couple of hours I had a return call and someone coming to \"check\" on my room. The resort manager, Mr Mario Ferno, called at 8:01 a.m. on day 6 of our vacation and promised to \"make things right\" and that there would be \"something for me\" at checkout. He also promised to have the room cleaned. On the night of our last stay the housekeeping staff arrived to clean the room as we were trying to get ready for dinner.

Overall I love this resort! It is beautifully maintained and the way it is spread out makes it never feel crowded. The rooms are fairly average but nice. On this particular trip my mom & I were traveling together and requested connecting rooms. While Disney will not guarantee this (they told me priority is actually given to families with young children) we had no trouble with getting our request. We were put in building 17 in the Alligator Bayou. My mom has a fear of bugs, lizards, alligators and other Florida \"creepy crawlies\" and she said if we had to do it over she would have requested the Mansions at Magnolia Bend or else stayed at the French Quarter. She felt that even though is was maintained, there was a little too much \"foliage\" and it was not all that well lit at night. (I did not think it was bad, but I thought I would mention this in case others are not much for the \"wooded\" atmosphere) As many other reviewers have mentioned, this resort is BIG. Expect to walk a LOT. We are in better than average shape (I was actually at Disney for the marathon weekend) and still found the walking to be a bit much at the end of a long day on your feet (or after running a half marathon!). However, I still think I would choose this over noise which is minimal because of the way it is spread out. Just don't choose this resort if you have physical limitations that make walking difficult. (Or at least make sure to stress to reservations the need to be in a close building!) The food court is very nice with a decent selection (for Disney). I know they renovated this area about a year ago and they did a nice job. We had no troubles with the Disney buses. Our only transportation issues were with the special marathon weekend buses. None of the Disney employees knew a thing about this and repeatedly gave me wrong information about bus time and locations to get to the race expo. Even the concierge seemed to know nothing about the marathon weekend even though at least half the guests at the resort seemed to be there specifically for that. That was our biggest gripe with the actual resort staff. Other than that they were great from check-in, mouse-keeping and bell services. It is a wonderful convenience to be able to check in your bags for your return flight at the resort! Overall it was another great visit to Riverside. I will definitely stay there again, though I might try the French Quarter if I go back for marathon weekend (less walking!). The one major advantage I see with Riverside over French Quarter are the \"quiet pools.\" There are something like 6-7 smaller pools throughout the resort that do not get nearly as busy as the main building. We used our nearest \"quiet pool\" several times and at the most there were 4-5 other people at any given time. One other great thing about Port Orleans is the boat to downtown Disney. Definitely take it at least once during your stay!", "Date": "February 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice Resort\u201d", "Author": "mardia", "ReviewID": "UR13782176", "Content": "I had originally booked our stay at the Port Orleans French Quarter, but after finding out that the resort's pool would be closed during our visit, changed our reservation to the Riverside. I received a letter stipulating that the pool was closed one week after returning home. As there were 6 of us, I booked 2 rooms and requested connecting rooms, and also requested a room not too far from the main dining area in the Alligator Bayou section, unfortunately our request was not honoured. The rooms were next to each other but not adjoining and were located in the Magnolia building - rooms 8925 and 8926. The rooms were fine, although you could definitely see the wear and tear. The location was okay, but I would definitely pay the extra $15 and get a view room. Although we did not have a view of the parking lot, the room was right beside two very large air conditioners, which you couldn't hear in the room, but sounded like airplanes taking off as soom as you opened the door. Mousekeeping did clean the room nice, and although we tipped every day, we never did get a towel animal, which my grandson looked for everyday. As per staying at a Disney Resort due to the perks is absolutely true. The Disney Express at the airport was hassle free; there was a Disney agent waiting at the airport giving directions to the loading area. Check in was absolutely hassle free. I must rave about the Disney transportation - absolutely wonderful throughout our entire stay - very seldom did we wait more than 10 minutes. The boat ride from the Riverside to Downtown Disney was always fun and quick - 20 minutes. We bought the refillable mugs - it's a must do! Great for soft drinks and coffee - for an 8 day stay we really saved a lot of money. As for the food court at the Riverside, I must say it was just okay. Most of the time the food was okay, but most of the time the food was cold. Never ate at Boatwrights, but heard it was good. This was our first visit to Disney World and we absolutely loved it. The parks were great and we absolutely loved Downtown Disney. As for the staying at the Riverside Resort, the visit was good but not excellent. We had a few hours to scour the resort before our vacation was over, so we took a trek over to the French Quarter. We had lunch at the food court there, far better than the Riverside and not as spread out.

Boatwrights is ok in my opinon but I am not a very big fan of southern style food. Now for the reasons the hotel was just average. The rooms were not that clean.

Very lush and green and well-maintained. It was such a calm, peaceful greeting when we returned from a day at the parks. We stayed in the Alligator Bayou section and I loved the recent renovations! The beds are framed with a faux curtain, the bed frame are branches and sticks, and the lights are designed to resemble tin lanterns. Also, since our last stay, they've added the privacy curtain in the bathroom sink area which is very helpful in the morning. The rooms are adequate size, not overly large, but not too small either. It was a bit of a walk from our room to the restaurant/registration area. I'd estimate it took us 5-10 minutes from the South depot to reach our room. If this is a concern for anyone, make sure and request something closest to the main building and avoid that walk. I've always found that WDW does a great job in trying to meet a customer's requests. After reading some of the recent reviews, I was a bit nervous about housekeeping. I can honestly say that our room was very clean and well-maintained! The only day we had a slight issue, was on the day we all slept in and didn't leave the room until noon. When we returned that evening, it was evident that the mousekeeper was more hurried as forgot some minor things. . such as replenshening the coffee supplies and cleaning the coffee pot, and the tub looked as if it was wiped quickly vs. more thoroughly.

The whole place was fantastic. I loved it for a variety of reasons, but it started with our hotel. It's been said, but I'll reiterate it, the grounds of riverside are gorgeous. Meandering rivers, bridges, gorgeous flowers, herons and egrets combine to create a truly remote feeling. As for the amenities, my daughter adored the pool, and, I must say, it was pretty great.

The rooms are large enough but i would say bring your own hangers as they only provide a small amount. The hotel has two restaurants, one that is a proper restaurant with fixed meals and then a hall with a wide variety of food to suit everybody, this is where we tended to eat as it was less expensive and suited us both. There are many other things to do at the hotel, horse and carriage rides around the resort, hiring a bike, hiring a boat to go down the river, there is also a boat service that takes you to downtown disney and the port orleans french quarter resort.

Food is a little pricey, especially if you have a family of more than two, but it's Disney and none of their food is what you would call cheap. We had a corner room, which was nice because it had two windows, rather than just one, and it's nice to have more light coming into the room. We've stayed at six Disney hotels, and I have to say Riverside is my favorite. I even preferred it over the Grand Floridian; GF is beautiful also, but their standard rooms aren't any larger than Riverside. I also thought GF was ridiculously expensive, unless you have alot of money to burn. Riverside also has boat transportation to and from Downtown Disney. It's about a 15-minute ride. I would highly recommend Riverside. I would gladly stay there again on our next visit to Disney.", "Date": "January 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cA fantastic family place\u201d", "Author": "TSHIndiana", "ReviewID": "UR12748507", "Content": "Our family had a great time at this Disney resort.

Check in was smooth as silk - we arrived around 4:00 pm and were checked in immediately. We were put in Acadian House (part of the \"mansions\" section). It was a very pleasant and pretty - and quite relaxing - walk from our room through the courtyard, over a lovely bridge, past the amusing main pool, over another scenic bridge to the main food area. It sounds long but the walk was really only about 5 minutes at a stroll and we enjoyed it each time. I can only imagine how pretty it must be when the flowers are in bloom! Our room was actually more spacious than I expected - there was plenty of room for my family of 4 (kids aged 8 and 11). We did not feel crowded at all. While it is obvious that the room is old and in need of freshening up, it didn't bother us at all. We were only in our rooms long enough to sleep, that's it. We didn't notice anything terribly wrong with the room other than perhaps it looked tired, but nothing that stood out as terrible. The beds felt comfortable to us and the linens were just fine! It was very quiet in a our room, too - we were not disturbed at all by any other guests. It was nice to have rooms opening to the outside vs. to an inside hallway. It was too cool (there was a weird cold snap hitting Florida when we were there) to swim other than the last day we were there - but my boys certainly enjoyed the pool that day. The water was heated quite nicely. I just found this was a very pretty resort and I really liked the fact that it didn't scream \"Disney\". I felt like I was somewhere other than Disneyworld, in fact! The area where the boat docks and that leads into the food court and the whole area around the river with the bridges is quite scenic. We did take the boat to Downtown Disney one evening and that was relaxing and peaceful and enjoyable - highly recommended (we were pretty much alone on the boat, due to either weather or time of year). We ate at the Riverside Mill for breakfast and we were very happy with the variety and selection for breakfast. I especially liked the yogurt/oatmeal bar - great idea! We did eat there one night for supper and again, there was enough selection and variety to please us all. We won't go back to Disneyworld because we had decided once was enough for our family, but I'm totally satisfied that on our one trip we selected Port Orleans Riverside. I am sure I would have been even happier if the weather had cooperated! We did take the Disney bus a few times (we were closest to the North Depot) and did not experience any problems at all.

It didn't feel like a massive resort, where we were, in terms of the number of guests we came across. Magnolia Terrace was only a short walk ( couple of minutes) to the main building over a bridge. The main pool was half way between the two. There were also quiet pools located around the resort which were relaxing places to go. There are two food outlets, Riverside Mill which is a food court and the Boatwright\u2019s Dining Room. Both good places to go for something to eat. The food hall has a range of food and any queue moved quickly. There is a free boat shuttle that takes you to downtown Disney which is a nice bonus. It takes about 15m and is a pleasant trip. You can also walk to the neighbouring French Quarter and use their facilities if you wish. You can park your car in any of the other resorts or in the theme parks for free when staying at any Disney property. A car is also useful to get to Florida Mall and all the other outlet shopping places, as well as the other theme parks nearby. All the staff were very helpful and polite; this was also the case around the theme parks too.

We so appreciated the curtain between the bedroom and sink areas, which allowed extra privacy for our group. The in-room coffee maker was also a very much appreciated amenity. I also think we had the best room care! Each day when we got back to our room there were bows made out of the bathmat and towels and one day we came back to find a peacock, that was just adorable!

To begin with I had a big problem getting a confirmation from DIsney when I sent my deposit in months ago, to the point where I had to write to the Presidents office. Guest relations then called me and sent me a hand written confiirmation with the amount that needed to be paid when I checked in. OK, so I thought that was settled. NOT! I arrived at the resort and check in took close to 45 minutes for me and there was no line. Of course they wanted to charge me more then I was supposed to pay and it was a good thing I called for the manager and showed him all of the back-up documents I had saved to prove the correct price. They also were supposed to give me a free $50 dinner card (go to mousesavers.com to find out how to get this and other freebies) but they did not have it. We finally agreed to deduct $50 from my bill. I then told them that I wanted a room close to the main lobby, food, etc. They gave me a room that they said was a 3 minute walk. Yea, it was three minutes if you are a marathon runner. It took 10 mintues to walk there and 10 minutes back to my room. I really don't want to spend that much time just to go get a cup of coffee or breakfast in the am before I go to the parks. The resort is huge and this was my major complaint. If you dont mind this then go stay there. Finding the room took another 45 minutes because even though there are some signs once you get to the block of rooms where yours is located it is very difficult to find the numbers. I had to go back to the main lobby and get someone to escort me to the room. Once in the room it was just OK. The decor was nice. However, the beds were very small. This is definitely not for someone who wants to sleep two to a bed unless you want to sleep on top of each other. Pillows were hard and so were the mattresses. As a previous reviewer mentioned there was refuse in the room under beds and other furniture from previous guests. Rooms was not cleaned very well. It was quiet until the last night when a couple moved in next door and had a huge party staying in other rooms on the floor. Everytime someone went in or out their door slammed and vibrated in my room. For anyone reading this please be consious of this and considerate of others. Now for the kicker. I don't know whether to laugh or cry. I ended up laughing because I didn't want this to ruin my vacation. When you flush the toilet it sounds like a bomb going off. You can also hear then from other rooms. The flushing was so powerful that water would come flying out of the toilet when you flushed it. One night I went to the bathroom and flushed the toilet and water shot up so high that it hit my neck. Can you believe this? The next morning I called the front desk to tell then about this and they laughed ansd transferred me to maintenance. Maintenance said they would see to it but never came and fixed it and I never got another call from anyone about it either. In the usual Disney tradition when there is a problem they cannot fix they generally just look the other way and ignore it.

This one feature almost makes it worth the stay on property. We made it quickly through the airport even though we had 5 sub-10 kids with us. The lines went quickly and we were on our bus in under 15 minutes. The busses were immaculate and very comfortable. Our luggage arrived later that evening with no problems. On arrival at the hotel I was prepared for battle. I had researched the hotel and, because of last years bad experience, knew what to ask for in a room. Using the Unofficial Guide to Disney World (the best $20 you can spend in preparation for Disney) I asked for a room in building 18. I was offered a room there but told that my friends with their three kids would be in a different area, as opposed to being in adjoining rooms as it was in building 16. The desk clerk assured me that we had very quiet, nice rooms so we took the building 16 rooms with the threat that we would be right back in all was not perfect. He could not have been more right. Even though we were only about 50 feet from one of the small pools it was quiet all of the time. The lush, tropical landscaping kills the noise in this property. Building 16 is just a short walk to the 1st bus stop for the property, so we always got seats. The room was good sized and well set up. A $20 tio to room service ensured towel animals all week. The kids stuffed animals were creatively arranged every evening, waiting for us in the window one night, watching tv another, a fun touch for the kids. Service was wonderful. We used the concierge service several times and each time I felt like I was dealing with an old family friend. The gift shop people went WAY out of their way. One night, we bought a toy for my son that did not include batteries, which we didn't discover until we were back at the room. When I found they were out of AAA batteries at the shop (?!?) the manager found some back in the office and didn't even charge me for them. Disney level service at it's best.

The hotel itself was nice, the room was spacious, my only critism of the room was that I felt it could have been slightly cleaner. Although the bedding, bathroom areas were clean I felt the 'unseen' areas hadn't been cleaned in weeks (maybe even months) ie tops of shelves, between beds etc. We did have a few problems with one of the rooms, we checked in and were given maps to our room, when we got to one of the rooms the key wouldn't work in the door. When we doubel checked we realised we had been given someone else's room key (as it had someone else's name on it) admitedly we should have double checked ourselves.

The hotel had told them that their room was ours (despite the fact that we weren't leaving for another 3 days). Their key didn't work and we assume it was just a mix up when giving the number out ... We took advantage of the disney dining plan, although not sure if we would use this again as we felt by the end of the week we hadn't really got the benefit from it, as in order to make maximum savings and get value for money you should have had a starter (appetiser), main and dessert. However most days we didn't want all 3! We had breakfast in our hotel most mornings, although we did go for breakfast in one of the resturants in the swan (it was a buffet and very nice). Evening meals we went to 50's Prime Time Diner (in MGM) which was pretty nice (traditional homecooked style food - meatloaf, pot roast etc), Ohana in Polynesian, food was lovely although we felt the service could have been a little better as other tables around us kept getting more meat brought to them.

One of the nicest meals we had was at The Contemporary Hotel (the name of the resturant I can't rememeber) it was on the 15th floor, although it used 2 of our dining credits it was still well worth it. The view is amazing. We got talking to one of the waiters and he recommended going back on one of the evenings when MVMCP was on and eating then, to tie in dining with the fireworks as he said the fireworks were amazing or to go back and tell them you have already dined there and you are just wanting a drink and you can watch \u00a340,000 worth of fireworks (which cost people approx \u00a340 for a ticket) FREE! Which we thought was a good tip. All in all the hotel was nice and it was worth staying at a disney hotel to take advantage of extra magic hours, no extra travel etc on top.

Transportation: We rented a car and I am so glad we did. My son was persistent about riding a Disney bus so we did to Epcot one evening and it was jammed full. And we had to wait thirty minutes to catch a bus back. So for me and for you guys with kids and strollers, rent a car!!! I am so glad we did!! Summary: All in all I would stay there again.... and I would do Dining Plan again we only spent money on souveniers this time and it was much better for the wallet!!!

I recommend arriving in the AM. We left Boston at 7AM and arrived at Orlando Airport by 9:30 AM. The Magical Express bus was waiting for us, no wait at the airport. Upon arrival at our hotel, which was the one and only stop that morning, we entered the lobby, and were taken directly to the front desk. No lines, no wait. The lobby was decorated festively for the holidays, absolutely stunning. We got into our room right away, and were off for a full day at the Magic Kingdom. Our room was more than large enough, ample towels, extra pillows, coffee maker and fridge. Very clean, lots of hot water, and a very quiet AC. What ever our need was at the time, we always got our questions answered promptly and with a smile! When we came back from our days at the park, it was lovely to sit by the fireplace off the lobby, have a beverage, and have pub style food at the bar. We love the buffalo boneless chicken fingers!! It was a lovely way to end our day. We have nothing against children, (have one ourselves) but after a long day of lines, children crying, it was such a relief to sit quietly and have appetizers and drinks. The horse drawn buggies, are so romantic, and for the more athletic you can rent a surrey bicycle (but they are not allowed at the French Quarter). We took the ferry almost every night to have dinner at downtown Disney. The Ferry ride in the night time is also very romantic, and quiet. After dinner, a 25 minute ferry ride back to the resort. Who could ask for better? We have been to many disney resorts, including the luxury resorts, but this one is quiet, awesome food, romantic, and away from the hussle and bustle of being directly in Disney.

I had booked a water view room almost a year in advance. Upon checking in around 9am we were assigned our room. When we got to the room, there wasn't even a pool view. I called the front desk and asked for a room change, it took some time but we were finally given a room on the second floor of the Acadian house with a view of the river. Very nice. This was my first stay at this moderate catagory hotel and I liked it better than the Coronado and the caribbean beach resorts. I really liked all the plants, flowers and trees around the resort , not to mention the beautiful river that winds it's way thru the resort. It made me feel like I was at home in Seattle. Our room was very clean and the only thing missing was shampoo and soap in the bathroom. One call to mousekeeping and they were brought to our room. The bathroom area was large but not much shelf space for stuff. Luckily we had a hanging toiletry bag so I just hung it from one of the hangers. It was also really nice to have a mini frige in the room to hold water and any left over snacks or food. We stayed in room 8255 and it was a short walk to the main pool, quiet pool and the food court/check in area as well as the north depot bus stop to go to the parks. The resort has all kinds of activities such as watercraft rental, horse drawn carriage rides in the evenings, the water taxi to the sister resort the Port Orleans French Quarter and Downtown Disney, a video game arcade, bike and surrey rentals, and you can even rent fishing poles and go fishing. Catch and release of course :-) We had a breakfast one morning at Boatwrights, I had eggs benedict (very good), niece had the french toast which was 3 HUGE slices of french bread baguette covered with cinnamon and sugar and hubby had the stuffed french toast which he said was very good also. Service at Boatwrights was friendly and pretty fast. We did purchase the dining plan as part of our package thru AAA. We also ate several times in the food court area and found the selections to be pretty good and the quality of the food to be pretty good. I don't think any of us completely finished our meals as the portions are very large. My fondest memory of this resort will be my encounter with some wildlife. One evening after returning from the parks. I was outside late at night just enjoying the quiet night air and I happened to look over in the bushes and there was a pretty good sized critter creeping out of the bushes. I had to do a double take before I realized I was looking at a armadillo! He walked right across the path in front of me! He didn't seem to even know I was there or he didn't care because he just went on his way. Pretty cool to see one that close up. We sure don't have them back in Seattle! We used the airport check desk at the resort and this is a really great service for guests. If you use the magic express service to return to the airport, a word to the wise....... Call bell services as soon as your bags are all packed and ready on the moring you check out and have them take your luggage to the check out area, get in line for the airline check in desk as soon as you can. There was a pretty long line when I got there and it took about an hour for me to get to the desk to check in. This desk closes at 1pm and I think this is because the connection between the resort and the airline gets cut off at that time. The cast members working this desk are at the mercy of the computer system linked to the airlines so please be patient with them. There are luggage scales right there and your luggage will be weighed before being tagged. If your luggage is over the 50 pound weight limit, it's my understanding you will not be able to use this service. I suggest buying a luggage scale and weighing your bags prior to getting in this line. We had a hand held luggage scale and it worked perfectly! Overall our experience at the Port Orleans Riverside was a wonderful one and I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a beautiful resort and great Disney service at a moderate price. This was my fifth trip to Walt Disneyworld and I've stayed at the Grand Floridian, the Coronado Springs, the Caribbean Beach Resort, the Beach Club and now the PO Riverside.

There are a lot of windy paths and if you aren't careful, you can end up walking a ways. It was very quiet during our stay, which was enjoyable. We had one of the quiet pools to ourselves many afternoons. The main pool (which is very themed) was always quite busy.

It was nice coming back and seeing what animal the towels were made into. We even got a card left in our room from Cinderella & her Prince wishing us a happy Honeymoon which was a nice touch. Boatwrights and the Food Hall were both brilliant as was the gift shop. Staying in Disney has definately got its benefits the one we found most useful was the delivery service back to the resort on purchases in any of the parks especially for attraction pictures. The location of the resort was great, not too far from any of the disney parks (you could even see Illumaintions at Epcot over by the main pool) and still in a good location to travel to the non Disney Parks.

It was a bit of a walk to the front, but we didn\u2019t find it to be a hassle at all (although if you have mobility issues, it could be a problem). We were also right next to a quiet pool and the laundry. No pool towels at quiet pools, so grab at the main pool or take your room towels. The main pool was great fun\u2026 the kids enjoyed the slide, as well as the kiddie pool which was fun for them to jump around in (very big and warm). The pool bar was nice, and the playground was right next to the pool as well. It was an easy walk to the food court to grab a bite and bring it back to the pool to eat. There were also bike and boat rentals and a little place to fish, none of which we had time to do (but wished we did). We enjoyed the water taxi twice\u2026 once to go to French Quarter\u2019s pool, which the kids loved as well, especially the slide (a bit gentler than at POR). As a comparison, FQ also seemed nice and more compact (food court didn\u2019t seem to have as many choices as at POR). We also water taxi-ed to Downtown Disney. It was a fun ride for the kids, although the boat is a bit loud. Easy transportation option, and the kids think they\u2019re on a ride! The food court was pretty good, lots of choices and pretty quick service (the last day we were there, the crowds picked up and it was a bit slower). We also did pin trading in the lobby. The arcade was pretty decent, but I like the arcades at All Star Sports and Pop Century better than this one (for little kids at least). One morning, many of the machines weren\u2019t working, but someone at the front desk got a manager on the phone and he was very apologetic and refunded the money we lost. As for bus transportation, I would walk to the front to catch a bus if I were you. We got one easily the first morning at the West Depot for AK magic hours. The next morning, we were going to MK and ended up at the main stop after breakfast, and still had to wait three buses to catch one (also, once they are full, they do not make the trip around to West, etc\u2026). I do not know when the 1st one actually made it around. But all in all, I found the bus transport to be good. The room was pretty standard, but I liked the privacy curtain at the sink area (good for putting a small child in a pack n\u2019 play or blow-up bed behind it like an extra room). And the main room lights had dimmers which was AWESOME!!! I have never had that at any of the other 4 Disney resorts I have stayed at. The pull out trundle was great for my big kid\u2026 a much bigger kid could probably fit as well. Refrigerator was nice to have as well.

We chose this hotel because we had visited some of the resorts last year on a day that we had deemed too rainy to go to the parks, and loved the atmosphere of Riverside. Part Mississippi riverboat, part Southern plantation, this is very nearly a perfect resort for the price, but I'm afraid the secret is out: Riverside must be very crowded, for the lines for the free bus transport are always longer than those for any of the other resorts. However, we found the grounds to be practically deserted most of the time. (Probably because the resort is very large and spread-out.) The food court was usually crowded, but we never had any difficulty finding a table close to the water wheel. The lobby, store, lounge, and restaurants are beautifully designed and decorated, each in its' own unique style. My husband grumbled about the \"high\" prices of food in the food court, but I thought they were very reasonable. We ate all of our meals at the food court and found the food to be of a higher quality than that of mall food courts. The breakfast made-to-order omelets and Mickey-shaped waffles with strawberries were fabulous. We stayed in one of the \"mansion\" rooms; furnished in a simple elegance, these rooms feature two double beds or one king, an ample table and two comfortable chairs, a comfortably upholstered bench, a beautiful mirrored armoire, refrigerator hidden in a wooden cabinet, and twin pedestal sinks in the dressing area. The resort is full of amenities I would have expected to find at a higher-priced property: beautifully landscaped grounds, spectacular views, bridges over a winding river with a free boat ride (to Downtown Disney,) seven pools, hidden and very private little nooks, and romantic rentals: bicycles built for one, two, four, or more; two-or-more passenger boats, and twilight horse and carriage rides. The lobby (like most of the Disney hotels) also features a little tv area just for children, with Disney (of course!) programs constantly playing. We found the entire staff to be extremely pleasant, helpful, considerate, and, seemingly dedicated to their jobs. The only drawbacks to this hotel (or any Disney hotel) are that they do not provide free wireless internet (a hook-up will cost you $9.95 per 24-hours,) the small size of the rooms, and prices of snack and pharmacy items in the store.

All the resorts used the same cup so we could refill for free at Animal Kingdom, the Polynesian, etc. We dined at Boatright's one night and while it was good, it was expensive and not alot of food on your plate. $9 for a cocktail was also a little steep! The general store sells alcohol but it too is very expensive. $19 for a 325 ml bottle of Absolut. As stated in another review, there is only one hot tub for the entire resort. It does get very crowded especially for us, the parks all closed early while we were there. One thing we noticed was how incredibly friendly all the cast members were. Everyone we passed had a sincere greeting for us whether it was hotel employees, park workers or bus drivers.

Since we were on a first floor, our view was obstructed by the plants and bushes surrounding the pool. Tip: A waterview room cost extra, if you get a room on the first floor it is not worth the extra money since your view will be obstructed. Rooms were cleaned everyday, but housekeeping had to be reminded to replenish the toiletries. Though I was on vacation, I unfortunately had to work for a couple of hours, Disney premises are not wi-fi capable and I could not use my aircard. Instead I had to rent a computer line from the hotel. Our room was located on the opposite side of the registration building. The walk around the premises and to the main building where all the restaurants and store was located was a nice leisurely stroll from our room. At night the view was beautiful. The buildings and architecture are reminiscent of New Orleans French Quarter. The main pool with the slide was always filled with families as to be expected, but the property offered four other quiet pools. The pool by the Alligator bayou rooms was always quiet, and there was always chairs available.

We stayed in one of the \"Oak Manor\" mansion rooms for our first 7 nights, then relocated to the Alligator Bayou building 26 for our last two nights. The grounds are beautiful, and there are alot of things to do around the resort if you decide not to go to the parks, ie.: The \"Surrey Bikes\", boat rentals, horse drawn carriage rides, swimming pools, fishing hole, and ferry boat rides to French Quarter & Downtown Disney. The \"mousekeeper\" at our Oak Manor room pretty much just made the beds & re-supplied the Disney soaps.....and that was about it. The mousekeeper at the Alligator Bayou room was great, a very noticable difference, and more what we expect for a Disney Resort. We liked the mansion room better I think- location closer to the center of activities, transportation, food, etc. We did have one problem aside from the lackluster Oak Manor mousekeeping, and it only happened one night, but that was enough for us to ask to relocate. Our next door neighbors (two rooms next to ours) -both rooms- a bunch were all traveling together, and decided to have a big party on the front balcony/walkway of the hotel. The room walls are all very well insulated for sound, but the front of the rooms where there are windows, are not so great keeping the sound out. That night was the only problem we had with noise, the partying adjacent neighbors were very loud & obnoxious. The next morning, I spoke with one of check-in managers, & she was wonderful, understanding of the situation-( I think others must of also complained besides us). That is when they relocated us to the bayou, where it seemed there was no one else around us for the remainder of our vacation. The only other minor critism I have is that there is only one hot tub, & it is big, but very popular & crowded after a day at the parks...the only time we were able to enjoy the hot tub was in the morning one day. They could use a few more hot tubs maybe with the quiet pools.

Back in February, I booked a MYW with Dining for October 21-27. We arrived in Orlando on the morning of the 21st. We used Magical Express from the airport to Riverside. Check in was smooth and they gave my boyfriend a pin since it was going to be his birthday during the week. We stayed in Acadian House, which is not too bad a walk from the building to Riverside Mill, but our room was at the furthest point in the building. The room was furnished OK. There was no overall cleanliness problem, just the whole place looked rundown. This place deserves a major rehab soon. Our bags were delivered while we were away in the parks. We had some snacks and wine delivered by wegoshop.com. I can't recommend them enough. You can shop from your preferred grocery/discount store and have it delivered directly to your room at the time of your choosing. No surprises or hidden fees. My boyfriend and I got engaged when we were down there as well. Buses were slow in coming and frequently overloaded. We were told at check in that the resort was at full capacity, yet the bus route was still shared with French Quarter. Being a former Disney resort employee, I was underwelmed by the attitude, performance, helpfullness and friendliness of the staff. Even when wearing pins announcing we had gotten engaged and it was his birthday, we didn't get any \"congratulations\" and only one \"happy birthday\". For me, it was very, very odd - not because I was expecting special treatment, but no acknowledgement was given and I found it disheartening. We used Magical Express for the return trip. Our flight was scheduled for 12:48 PM. Our Magical Express instructions told us to take the 10 AM bus. We arrived at the hotel lobby with our luggage at 8:45 AM, knowing it can take a while to check in. When we finally got to the front of the airline check in line, we were told that our luggage would not make it on our flight because we were not within the three hour window prescribed by Disney. We showed the letter which was left on our door instructing us which bus to take. We were told they could not guarantee anything and we would probably not make the bus ourselves. The next bus would be able to take us, but we may not make our flight. Fortunately, I knew enough to force the issue with the correct people and both we and our luggage made both the bus and the flight. The food court was at best average. The Disney Dining Plan was definitely worth the money. I would advise using Magical Express from the airport to Disney, especially if you want to take advantage of the facilities and parks upon arrival and do not need your luggage immediately to do so. I would not advise it for the return trip.

Our room was not ready at that early time, so we gave our carry ons over to the Luggage Storage and were on our way. At 3:00 pm we had to call and see if our room was ready and they said they were shampooing the carpets and it wouldn't be ready for another 2 hours. This made me a little grumpy because we had been up since 3 am and just wanted to get back and relax. Our friends room was ready so we went to there room and tried the keys in our room and it was done. Don't know why they said another 2 hours but we had our luggage delivered probably within 1/2 hour of calling. We were in the Alligator Bayou Building 25. A walk to the main buildings, but close to the West Bus Stop and we had a quiet pool and laundry facilities right outside our room-- which was extremely nice. If going for a long time... Do not overpack... the laundry room was very nice and accessable at all hours. $2.00 per wash and $2.00 per dry-- I brought my own travel size detergent. Food was ok...nothing special but there was a large selection. Dining hall was sometimes crowded, but you could usually find a table within a few minutes. Buy the refillable mugs!!!!!! It may seem like a lot in the beginning ($13 each) but you are sure to get your monies worth. I know we made several random trips just to get a drink. The buses.... YUCK!!! Depending on what time you leave to go to the parks... you will be herded onto the bus until there is absolutely no more room for one more person. I know the drivers tried their best, but leave in plenty of time if you have a reservation. You may stop at other resorts plus all of the bus stops around the hotel. You will learn the best times to go for the buses... But be prepared for a not so great experience. We decided just to make the best of it and altered our plans as necessary. The grounds were beautiful. The kids loved the pool and the waterslide. Take the boat to and from Downtown Disney. It is a nice relaxing boat ride. Helpful hint: We traveled with our 2 kids.. 5 & 7. Before we left, I packed a small box of snacks, juice boxes & goodies to keep in the room (Rooms have refrig). With airline restrictions and having to pay for luggage or over the weight limits, I UPS'd ($10-$15) it to myself at the hotel to be there when we arrived. I packed peanut butter and jelly and you can get 2 slices of bread at the dining hall for cheap. It made for a quick snack or even a breakfast some mornings when we wanted to avoid the crowds and the lines and we ate in our room.

No lines at check inn at 2:30 pm however our room was not ready till 3:30pm, so we just walked around the resort and checked out the stores\\food court. The room was fine for two people any more it would have been cramped. The bed was fine however the pillows were small and stiff. The room was pretty clean but far from the food court but close to a bus stop, somtimes a little noisy as it was right next to the pool. We stayed in the Aligator Bayou room 2042. Maid service was good, no issues. I highly recommend using the Disney dinning plan and make your reservations way in advance. We ate at Borights one night at the resort it was real good. Food court was also had a big selection. We also ate at Wolfgang Pucs, Spoodles, Sci-Fi Drive inn, 50's primetime, food was good everywhere, again you need to make reservations and leave your hotel at least 1.5 hours before your dinner time as the buses can take a while and the walk to the restaruant can also take a while. The hotel grounds we nice and clean, Port Orleans Riverside I would say is more for adults then children. Most of the time the room was pretty quiet, sometimes you could hear kids at the pool late at night but eventually they went to bed. Another thing to note after fireworks at night, there is a mad rush to the buses so you may be waiting up to an hour. There is also a growing trend of non-handicap (overweight-lazy) people using scooters to get around, they can hold the bus up for 20-30 min while the driver has to load their scooter on, one \"handicap\" man actually picked his scooter up and carried it onto the bus after making everyone wait 20 min.

This was about the 8th time we've made this our vacation home during our last 13 visits to Disney. During this visit we stayed in Lodge 27 of Alligator Bayou. It was a nice location, offering a rather short walk to the food courts, Old Man Island swimming pools, and the main bus depot. Overall, the rooms have been slightly updated during the past couple of years, with noticeable upgrades in the bathroom and the addition of a privacy curtain near the sinks. The best upgrade is the addition of a refridgerator! Sure, it's not huge, but it still offers plenty of room for leftovers, milk and water. Overall we continue to be very pleased with this resort--which is one of the main reasons we continue to return to Riverside. At check in, our room had a few housekeeping concerns that took longer to correct than should be the norm. There were traces of leftover shaving cream on the tile at the back of the shower, lip marks from a toddler on the mirror, and two mystery spots on the tile (one of which was nearly petrified gum). My wife called housekeeping and despite being assurred we would get the \"VIP Cleaning\", it still took two days to correct these. My recommendation to the Housekeeping Manager would be to focus periodically on a true deep clean and dusting. Unless you're really brave, you probably should not look (or most importantly place) anything on top of the television stand, as this is a major source of dust bunnies. We traveled with our 4.5 year old and 15-month old sons. A pack and play was provided, however full-size bed sheets were the only sheets provided for the pack and play. A call to housekeeping and the matter was resolved within minutes and fitting sheets for the pack and play were provided. The rooms are quite goods sized by Disney standards. A recommendation for those traveling with small ones using a stroller would be to request a first floor room--as hauling a stroller up and down the stairs became rather tedious by the end of our vacation. The food court has been updated--offering about the same variety of food as in the past with the addition of some \"flair\". The food court is usually very crowded in the morning and evenings. The onsite restaurant Boatwrights offers a very nice menu, especially for those on the Disney Dining plan. One plus of Riverside is the location. Although the trips to and from the parks can be trying--especially on a crowded bus at the end of the day, the location assures you're not trapped in a bus for nearly as long as you would be if you stayed in one of the All-Star resorts. The idea of being able to take a boat from Downtown Disney at the end of the evening where most times you don't have to break a stroller down is a definite plus.

However we needn't have worried, it was a lovely area of the resort and no-one had any trouble sleeping after busy days visiting the parks. From here it was a short walk to the lobby/food court area. When we needed a swim in the pool to cool down later in the day, we tended to use the smaller pool nearby rather than go to the main pool which tended to be very crowded at times, even late at night! The boat service to the French Quarter/Downtown Disney was excellent, and boat drivers were happy chatting away during the journey and giving a bit of info on the surroundings. Boats were pretty regular, probably around 10-15 minutes between them. Also the bus service was impressive, rarely did we have to wait any length of time - the only time we had a reasonable wait (20-25 mins) was when we were waiting at the Magic Kingdom after the fireworks, obviously a very busy time! Just a couple of warnings - the food court is very busy in the mornings! With most people getting to the parks between 9-10am, everyone was eating between 8.30-10am in my experience. You have to queue to get your food, then queue again to pay for it - this can be a bit time consuming. I did not enjoy the entertainment - Bob the Piano Player. Personally I wanted to enjoy a quiet beer in the bar, but this was impossible with the entertainer urging everyone to sing along to the most irritating songs. In the UK you can go to Butlins for such entertainment, rather than pay Disney prices to get that. We went there on a couple of occasions and it was exactly the same show.

We had only a short wait in the line for registration of perhaps 5 or so minutes, our check-in papers were all in order and correct, and we had keys in hand in about 10 minutes. Prior to my arrival, I had requested to be in the Alligator Bayou section in buildings #14, #15, or #16 if possible. However, upon check-in, we were informed that all 16 Bayou buildings were full of families who had 5 people. The registration cast member did try to re-check one more time about getting us in a Bayou building, but to no avail. We also had requested a ground room floor, but were again denied, due to the sheer number of rooms booked at P.O.R. for the week. The cast member informed us that over 800 rooms were \u201cchecked in\u201d on Saturday, and so by Tuesday, rooms were very limited for requests (something to keep in mind for future visits). We were assigned room 8912 in the Magnolia Terrace building of the resort on the 3rd floor facing the river, but no direct water view. This room location was a much longer walk to both the food court and the parking lot than I was hoping for, but we still managed pretty well. The room was large and clean for the most part, but the mansion building\u2019s rooms have not been renovated in some time, so the wear-and-tear is starting to show and renovations appear to be needed. We had two very comfortable double beds, however, with good mattresses. Linens were very clean with some signs of wear, but not much. Carpet was vacuum-clean, but had seen its share of traffic over the years. The two pedestal sinks were so convenient for us, and there was a full-length shelf running the length of the sink area to place our cosmetic items on. There was a ceiling fan which helped with cooling of the room, and the A/C was very cold and worked great with no motion sensor, just an adjustable thermostat. I found no \u201cblack dirt\u201d along the vents of the A/C, so I had no cleaning of that to do either. We found no residual dirt or hair in or around the bathroom or sink areas. I also loved the individual light fixtures over each bed which had dimmer switches instead of \u201cflip\u201dones. Disney has converted many of the room light bulbs to the longer-lasting, low-energy florescent bulbs, so lighting is very bright in the bathroom areas now. In the room, we had a mini-fridge, coffee pot, ironing board with iron, safe, wall-mounted hair dryer, and 27-inch remote controlled T.V. inside a large T.V. cabinet with several drawers underneath for storage. No problems with the mini-fridge this year, as it stayed cold enough to practically freeze our liquids during the week. We also had an extra pillow in the closet area, bringing the total of 5 to the room. The closet area had 11 wooden clothes hangers with a long shelf above the hanging rack. There was an additional small rack in the main room with pegs for hanging items and a short shelf. There was also a retractable \u201cclothes line\u201d in the bathtub/shower area for hanging wet items over the tub. The exhaust fan in the bathtub area was \u201cmotion sensitive\u201d and would cut on anytime you entered the bathroom area and flipped on the light. The tub had a very nice shelf section across the entire back side for your cosmetic items and there were two built-in soap dishes in the tile walls of the tub area. The tub also had a \"pull up\" bar for those who need a hand-hold. The shower head was an actual \u201cShower Massage\u201d brand and had several water settings to choose from for water. I was also very happy to see a \"recycling\" bin in the room for paper, plastic bottles, and cans. We had very little actual garbage as a result. Housekeeping during our stay was excellent. Each day, we were left with 2 or 3 bars of bath soap and at least 2 bars of facial soap, along with 2 or 3 small bottles of shampoo/condition. The soaps have changed this year and are round-shaped instead of bar-shaped as in the past. We always had one to two spare rolls of toilet paper (2-ply, but rough texture). Since Carol drank coffee each morning, the coffee supplies were also replenished each day, and the coffee pot cleaned. We had one \u201ctowel critter\u201d in the room when we arrived (a puppy dog), but we never received any more during our 5-night stay. I was looking forward to having a collection of them by week\u2019s end, but it never came to be. Each day, we were left 4 bath towels, 2 hand towels, and 4 wash clothes. I left a $2 tip each day during our stay, and $5 tip on our check-out day. The area surrounding our building was brimming with greenery and, during the week, we crossed paths with rabbits, mallard ducks, and other native water birds regularly, along with countless lizards. The grounds of the entire resort were once again simply wonderful and beautiful to explore. The main pool area is large, and the regional \u201cquiet\u201d pools within the building complexes were also nice. There were surrey bikes rentals, horse carriage rides, boat rentals, a children\u2019s playground, and a fishing hole area. Our Magnolia Terrace building had a beautiful garden gazebo out front near the river. The river setting of this section of Port Orleans is a real delight for a nature lover. The main pool on Ol\u2019 Man Island was very busy and noisy during our entire stay, so Carol choose to visit the quiet pool next to our mansion\u2019s building on one of our resort days. During our stay, we utilized the boat transportation service to Downtown Disney, and what a delightful ride it is. The boat ride takes about 20 minutes total, with a stop at the French Quarter section, but it\u2019s a very relaxing experience. The food court, called Riverside Mill, was excellent as well. I loved the large water wheel you could sit near and watch as you ate. While we only ate two meals at the food court, both were excellent. I had no problems using the Disney Dining Plan at the food court as everything was clearly labeled as to whether it was counter service or snack credit. We did purchase the refillable mugs for the resort, but didn\u2019t make as much use of them as I would have liked, due to the distance from our room. However, the choices for drinks were excellent. Condiments of all kinds were plentiful as well. We never had the chance to eat at Boatwright\u2019s Dining Hall. When check-out time arrived, we\u2019d opted for the express check-out when we registered, so it was extremely fast and easy. We were leaving early in the morning around 8:00 A.M., so we had no wait at all for check-out. One thing I noticed during the week was that all varieties of the refillable mugs were being used by guests, and all were allowed. You didn\u2019t have to have the 2007 version at all, and one man we saw each morning actually had a mug from back when the resort was still called Dixie Landings. I even saw mugs from other resorts being used, but no one from Disney seemed to object. I was also somewhat disappointed that the current mugs are smaller than previous versions. I now regret not purchasing one of these mugs last year on my first trip. Price of the mugs is still $11.99 + tax, and, after visiting other resorts, it does appear that the same mug is being sold at each resort this year, rather than each having it\u2019s own version.

We decided to come to Orlando one day early and only needed a hotel for one night. We arrived at the resort around 12:30 p.m via Disney's magical express. Check in went quickly. Our room wasn't ready but I was given a phone number to call periodically to check on the room status. We had lunch at the food court. I had the chicken pasta and my son had the chicken tender, fries and a sundae. My pasta was good but I didn't like the chicken in it ( it was very tough). Chicken tenders, fries and sundae were fine. I called to see if the room was ready and it was not. Actually, the room was not ready until approx. 3:45p.m. I packed a swim suit for my son for this reason so we headed over to the pool. While my son swam, I found a nice spot at the Muddy Rivers bar overlooking the pool. I really liked the set up of the bar area. I sat in a comfortable chair with a drink while watching my son in the pool. I requested a room in the AB section, bottom floor and I was given this (Building 28) Our room was located at the back of the building. There wasn't much of a view, but I liked how you got the feeling of a cabin in the woods because of all the foilage. The room was really cute. I liked how the beds were made out of timbers and the double sinks in the bathrrom area. The room appeared very clean and we had three towel animals waiting for us (adorable). The walk to the main building took between 5 and 10 minutes. I would have preferred to be closer to the main building but our location was fine for one night. The next morning we had breakfast at Boatwrights restaurant. We had an omelette (sp.) and french toast. The breakfast was large and very good. Our waitress was friendly and efficient. I would have enjoyed another day or two to check out the rest of the resort but because we were heading to Universal Sat. and returning to Wilderness Lodge on Monday we didn't have the time.

We arrived around 1:30pm to find only one other person in line to check in. Check in went smoothly. Our room was 1521 at Alligator Bayou. It was a first floor room which was really nice. It was also right to a parking lot which was right next to the entrance to the resort so the location was perfect for us. The room was very clean and better than I even expected. We recieved a call about an hour after we checked in asking if we approved of our room. They left a message since we were already go to the parks! We drove to the parks instead of using their shuttles. With the parks being as empty as they were while we were there, driving was a smart option since we parked so close! We visited the foodcourt for pizza at 11:30pm. The pizza was very good. We visited the quiet pool which was a short walk away.

Every park we went to on the way home there was a huge line-up to the Port Orleans resorts. Obviously this is nothing new as previous reviews suggest. One night when we were leaving the Magic Kingdom we went on the French Quarter bus, the Riverside bus was extremely lined up and no one was waiting for the FQ bus.

Instead I shall address some of the points raised by other and give you my views on the resort. Size Matters One of the biggest issues posted about this resort is its size and the amount of time it takes to get around it. Even one of the better known (and extremely comprehensive) Disney guides says how its staff rent bikes when staying there. All I can think is that in this modern day certain people, and possibly certain nationalities have forgotten how to use their legs. I walked around the entire inner road and it took about 10 minutes. I can not believe any room is more than 5 to 7 minutes from reception. The resort is big but it is not enormous and is certainly not so big that it will cause any but the most rotund guests problems with walking. If you are concerned about carting your luggage around they will pick it up or drop it off at your room if you ask. This resort is NOT too big as long as you have at least a vague recollection of what your legs were designed for. The only size issue I have with POR is that as some people are too lazy to walk to the main bus stop POR has 4 of them. This means you can get on a resort bus at the main reception (the south depot) and still be on the same bus 15-20 minutes later after stopping at the 3 other stops at the same resort and end up practically back where you started from. To Flush or Not to Flush (the big noise debate)\u2026 Another issue that seems to arise a lot is that of noise from other rooms, specifically the noise of the neighbours flushing their toilet. To answer the question \u201ccan you hear the neighbouring rooms when they flush their toilet\u201d simply, the answer is yes you can. However, to answer it in a bit more detail, you can hear it mainly because the toilets flush with a similar noise and ferocity as aeroplane toilets, and flush for about the same amount of time. You can hear it but only just and it\u2019s hardly a big problem. I travel a lot on business and have a real issue with noisy rooms but I can confirm that these rooms are not noisy in the traditional sense i.e you can not hear the neighbours. However, I suspect the main reason you can\u2019t hear the neighbours is because it\u2019s difficult to hear anything much over the air-conditioning. Sadly POR still uses the old-fashioned \u201cin-window\u201d type aircon units rather than central air and this causes 2 problems. Firstly it isn\u2019t quiet and secondly the person in the bed nearest the aircon unit freezes at night whilst the person furthest away boils. The only time we heard noise other than of our own making (and the infamous flushing of toilets) was when the people in the room next door decided to have a loud conversation on the balcony outside our room. Cleanliness is next to Disneyness\u2026. There have been comments about the bathrooms being dirty with mildew on the tiles and shower curtains. All I can say is that our bathroom was spotless. There was a slight stain on the carpet in the main living area but nothing unexpected for a hotel room. We did find a mini-donut under the front of the aircon unit the day we left and it wasn\u2019t ours so it must have been there for at least 17 days but on the whole the housekeeping and cleanliness were adequate. We had loads of towel animals made for us too, and the maid kept re-arranging all of my sons soft toys in the window in amusing ways. Made us laugh every time we came back to the room. On the whole the maid service was excellent and the room was certainly on a par with the better hotels I have stayed in. Spooky Lighting One of the other reports referred to the \u201cspooky\u201d lighting at POR and said it reminded them of a Scooby Doo set. I find this very odd. The lighting is probably best described as \u201cromantic\u201d. If you want floodlighting sleep on a football field. The lighting is minimal but very nicely done. Wildlife There is lots of wildlife at POR in the form of very friendly rabbits, ducks, egrets, tree frogs, massive butterflies and see if you can spot the otter at the fishing-hole (a real one, not a Disney animatronic). Riverside Views For some reason we were given a riverside view even though we hadn\u2019t requested (or paid) for one. However, when I say riverside view what I actually mean is tree view. You could see the river but only partially as it was blocked by a large tree. This is actually more of a problem than it sounds as the tree blocked about 80% of the light coming into the room. This means that even during the day the room was so dark we needed to have the lights on. POR or POFQ There is obviously a little bias here but we spent a fair bit of time at POFQ and although I am sure the rooms are pretty much the same I can make the following observations. The arcade is about 1/3 the size of POR as are the check-in and the food court. PRFQ has no full service restaurant. The boats, bikes etc are rented from POR so you\u2019ll have a bit of a walk or a boat ride to rent them. The grounds and the pool look distinctly shabby in comparison to POR. Also the general architecture makes POFQ look like a cheap motel rather than a nice hotel. I think if you stay at POFQ and walk up to POR you will spot a massive difference in the styles and layouts of the hotel. There is also no large dock at POFQ as there is at POR, just the doc for the boats to downtown Disney (which start at POR so are often full by the time they get to POFQ). Conclusions Port Orleans Riverside is a fantastic family hotel. You would have to be in a very bad mood or be very unlucky not to enjoy your stay there. We visited many of the other hotels whilst there, including the Grand Floridian, and found POR to be the best hotel by a long way. The food in the food court is very good but the sit-down restaurant is just ok. It is a very very nice hotel with excellent amenities and a really great place to stay. Have a great time there, we certainly did.", "Date": "September 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island,New York", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel was GREAT!\u201d", "Author": "funinthesun0007", "ReviewID": "UR8606111", "Content": "My family of 5 just got back from Disney's Port Orleans Riverside and LOVED IT!

Traveling with our three children (ages 1,4 and 6), we found our double Queen room in Oak Manor to be more than adequate. After spending 10-13 hours each day in near 100-degree heat at the theme parks, it was a cool and comfortable respite from the hustle and bustle around us. Even though our room was close to the pool, it seemed the walls were thick enough that we were never bothered by noise. The property itself is well-maintained with plenty of shade trees and manicured lawns. (Look out for some agressive ducks, though. Disney grounds personnel fed a group of ducks near our building every morning and the waterfowl would spend the rest of the day following guests around \"begging\" for food. Some may find this cute but the last thing I want is my toddler nipped by a wild duck.) There were plenty of paths for quiet strolls about the grounds. The common buildings were clean and charming. We used the Disney Dining Plan and found the quick-service restaurant on the property to be convenient and filled with tasty options. The Boatwright's Dining Hall table service restaurant on the property was seldom crowded but featured large portions of outstanding food and excellent, friendly service. The crawfish cakes are a must-try. While we did not use the main pool on Ol' Man Island at the center of the resort, the one between our bulding and the next was very clean, well-kept and often left open after hours to accommodate guests due to the heat wave. Throughout our stay, the people working at the resort catered to our every request and really took time out make sure and spoil our children. The concierge and bell hop personnel were especially accommodating. One particularly good experience for the older boys was renting a pole and using the fishing pond on the property to catch some small bass and blue-gills with which the \"river\" (more of a man-made canal running through the resort to PO French Quarter and Downtown Disney) was well stocked. Two areas left something to be desired, however. The Disney Magical Express and bus service to and from the theme parks was anything but Magical. We lost 2 hours of our first day at the airport waiting with hundreds of people in a space that did not feel air-conditioned for busses that seemed to only trickle in. On the way home, our driver dropped us off at entirely the wrong terminal , even though he knew what airline we wwere flying. Once we got to the resort and checked in, things went well however, until we needed to get back and forth to the theme parks. Time and again, whether coming to or going from a park and whether it was 10 AM, 2 PM, or 2 AM, we waitied in long lines for busses while people going to other resorts were picked up at least 1 1/2 times as frequently. My elderly mother and wound up on a three-hour odyssey trying to get back to her room from Blizzard Beach because of bad directions from staff and inefficient route service. It got to the point one day at EPCOT that myself and several other guests were saying we had gotten the \"real New Orleans experience\" and Disney must be run by FEMA becuase we waited forever in the heat for busses that would never seem to come. The only other negative was what I found when I went to retrieve my glasses that had fallen in front of the night stand one morning. While the room seemed quite clean otherwise, I found adult entertainment items and a half-eaten bag of chips under the night stand from a previous guest. This did not mesh with the rest of our stay because the room really seemed properly cleaned on a daily basis. Overall, it was a good experience at an affordable price for our family (I would liken it to a clean Holiday Inn with Embassy Suites-level customer service) and we will most likely book this resort for our next Disney vacation in two years.", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norway, Maine", "Title": "\u201cA great experience\u201d", "Author": "silver1ME", "ReviewID": "UR8517192", "Content": "We just returned from a FANTASTIC experience. I went with my two teenagers (17 & 18). I was a bit hesitant to stay at Port Orleans Riverside after reading some of the reviews but boy am I glad we did. We had no problem checking in - it only took 15 - 20 minutes and our room was ready. We were in Building 85 in Magnolia Terrace and we loved it - perfect location. We were only a few minutes walk from the theme pool and the dining areas and only a short walk to the bus stop and the quiet pool. Yes the weather was hot.... but what else do you expect in Florida during August! We took advantage of the pools in the morning and then went off to the parks in the afternoon. We were happy with the food in the food court and extremly happy with the restaurant. We had dinner their the first night and found both the food and the service excellent (by the way we highly recommend the Disney Dining Plan and making reservation at least a month prior to your trip). The buses were great. The average wait was approx 15 minutes and the only time we found the buses full were at night when the parks were closing and everyone was going back to their rooms for the night. However, we expected that and so we were fine with it. We did take the boat a couple times. It was relaxing but we found it was abit slower than the buses. The kids rented the two man boats at the resort and had a blast. They also loved the extra evening hours at the parks. They would stay at the parks til they closed and then come back and swim at the quiet pools at 2am! They loved it. They also liked the arcade at the resort. The only negative things I can add is that their was a hole in the wall in the bathroom (where the bathroom door knob had gone thru the wall) and there were times that our room could have been cleaned abit better. However, overall..... a great stay. We had stayed at the Caribbean Beach resort a few years back and didn't really care for it. This trip we took time to tour and eat at many of the other resorts (Animal Kingdom Resort, Polynesian, The Contemporary, The Boardwalk, French Quarter). All in all, I would not hesitate at all to stay at POR again. The grounds were gorgeous, loved the laid back atmosphere.

Both were very good; the Filet Mignon at Boatright's was the best I have ever had! The transportation service was good as well. No mosquitoes to deal with was a pleasant surprise. Our building was as far away from the main building as you can get at the resort, but our family found the walk very pleasant walking along the river - it took about 5-8 minutes to get there. There is also a large general store there with almost everything you would need; we were pleased to find ear drops for our 9 year old who had developed swimmer's ear. They also rent bikes, kayaks, and boats at the resort. You can also take a boat to the French Quarter (sister resort) or to Downtown Disney; we just didn't have enough time to do that, but it looked like fun. On the last day, we were able to check our luggage in and obtain our boarding passes from the lobby - a great service that worked flawlessly.

Last year I stayed at the Animal Kingdom Resort. The food court at Animal Kingdom was no where near as good as Port Orleans Riverside. The Resort, as all Disney Resorts I visit was always clean. Never see any garbage! I saw a soda fall in the dining area. In 3 minutes it was cleaned up. You would never know there was a spill! The pool was great, the New Orleans feel was right on! My wife and two kids loved the hotel. We spoke with people who stayed at the French Quarter and they all felt that 'Riverside' had a better restauraunt and food court. The room we had was great. A little tight, but who cares? Especially when you spend the day at the parks. The Resort is HUGE so if you mind a little walking around to get from point A to point B, you may want to stay at the French Quarter. People who complain it is a little overpriced don't put into account the great food and transportation Disney provides to the parks.

There was an accumulation of dust on the top of the armoire, and on the light fixture in the sink area, but the room ws made up every day by 2pm or so. No towel animals or posing of my daughters stuffed animals, but no deal breaker there.

The meal plan was a great value, but thats another review... We ate at Boatwrights one night...I enjoyed it very much. Our waitress, Kerri, was excellent, and the food and portions were just right. The little store in the main building had everything you might need.

We are a family of 5 with Mom, Dad, preteen daughter, and sons ages 9 and 7. We have stayed at Disney twice before, and have always been pleased with the service and the attention to detail. In the past, we've stayed at the cabins at Fort Wilderness, and at All Star Movies. Since this is a moderate resort, we expected decent, Disney service. We were disappointed. When I initially made our reservations, I requested the Disney Magical Express service. When we received our documents, our tags weren't included. When I called to ask, they said that I was signed up, and not to worry. I wasn't surprised to find out that we weren't on the DME list when we got to the airport. They did take care of us, and we arrived at the hotel just fine. Once at the resort, we were charmed by the decor. We live in a Victorian home in a historic district, so we really felt at home with the charming trim and soft colors. The check in process was not very good. Although it was quick, it wasn't accurate. I had major surgery in May, and requested a room on the first floor, since I was renting a scooter. I was assured that there was no problem. When I reminded them of that request at check in, they again said it was no problem. The clerk then told me where to go to get my scooter. She was well aware of my needs. We were given very poor directions to our room, and actually ended up on the path to the Port Orleans French Quarter resort. Once I realized this, and we were on the path back to our room, a half an hour had passed. When we got to our room, we found it was on the 2nd floor. There were no elevators, and no way to get the scooter upstairs. Fuming, we went back to the front desk, and again reminded them that I was unable to use a 2nd floor room, and to please put us in a first floor room, as I had requested, and as they had said we had when we initially checked in. They gave us a new room, and we were again given poor directions to the room. Another hour wasted. I couldn't believe we had been there over 3 hours, and were still messing with check in! Once situated in our new room, we tried to find the bus stop to take us to the parks. There were no signs anywhere. We walked/scooted for about 20 minutes before we found a sign that told us that the bus stop was behind our original circle. At this point, I didn't think we'd ever get to the parks. The rooms are adorable. We were in Alligator Bayou, which had two beds and a trundle, along with overhead ceiling fans, adjustable lighting, rustic decor and a soft bench. We loved that the bath and sinks were separate, and that the sink area was separated by a curtain. It was charming. The rooms are small, but large enough, even with all of our luggage! The paths were rustic and nice. The river running through the resort was nice. Every so often, you'd see a bird or lizards. There was a family of ducks ahead of us on a trail one day. That was a neat touch. We loved the little bridges connecting the main hall to the rest of the resort. The dining hall was kind of a mess. The floor by the drinks was always sticky and filthy, and I never saw anybody cleaning it. It was very difficult to find a clean, empty table, and we didn't even eat during the peak times! There is a charming water wheel on the outside of the building, which was very thematic. The main swimming pool was nice enough, but it would have been better if the slide was turned on, or at least if there had been a sign stating that the slide wasn't working. Instead, my children climbed the bath, only to be turned away. The hot tub was a nice touch, and very comfortable after a busy day at the parks. The poolside bar was never open, and we were there three different times. We have never had these issues with Disney before, and were very disappointed that we had them this time. Even my children were disappointed, and for the first time, we aren't planning a follow up Disney trip. The hotel was nice, but we really got the feeling that the staff was overwhelmed by the summer crowds.

After a very longwinded departure from Orlando International Airport (you collect your luggage and then get separated from it again) we collected our hire car and drove ourselves to the resort. It is possible to book Disneys Magical Express which is a free service, if you don't plan to hire a car. You park at the front of the main resort building to check in. This is a slow process considering it is tea-time there, but our body clocks are almost at midnight!, however, this is due to the staff being very helpful. We were given a map to our rooms, directions for parking and also advice where to catch the nearest Disney bus to get to the parks. This is a large resort, and our room was quite a walk from the main building, which feels much longer after a day at the park. The site was immaculate and the staff work very hard to keep it that way. The buildings are all two storeys high. We stayed in the area known as Alligator Bayou. The landscaping gives it a traditional swamp feeling with lots of greenery. There are little lizards flitting around when its hot and we saw owls, hares and even a raccoon whilst we wandered around. Be prepared for the afternoon storms. We tended to get very sunny mornings and around mid afternoon a wet and windy storm would arrive. We carried our little raincoats everywhere and they were a Godsend. You do dry off fairly quickly, temps were around 90 deg+. Food is of an average standard in the food hall. You can make your own yoghurt parfait (add fruit and cereals of your choice to yoghurt) but this is large enough for two people. There is a cooked breakfast with Mickey waffles, bacon, scrambled egg and sausage. There is also a grill and a bakery where you can get lovely cinnamon buns, cookies etc. We tended to just get small pots of yoghurt and fresh fruit pots here. The food hall is open from 7am until 11pm. In the evening you can make your own salad, have a roast or design your own pasta (although this is flooded with cooking oil) and visit the grill. This is absolutely fine if you are on a budget. There is a restaurant next door, which we visited a couple of times which introduced us to cornbread - delicious! A nice varied menu with much smaller portion sizes, which we prefer as most meals in and around the parks there are huge. There is a shop here where you can buy all the usual souvenirs as well as sun lotions, toiletries, and chilled beers, milk and butter, books, magazines etc. We used to buy the cereals and milk as there is a small fridge in the room. This way we could get out to the parks early (much easier to get on the rides before lunchtime when the parks get packed). We used to leave a small tip for the maid each day and she would leave our childrens cuddly toys arranged in little hammocks and also make little shapes out of the facecloths and towels. We never knew what we were coming back to, which was great fun. Our children used to get tired at the parks by mid afternoon and wanted to come back to the pool. The pool in Alligator Bayou has no lifeguard, so parents need to supervise. There are sunloungers around the pool. There is another pool called Ol' Man River which is nearer to the main resort building, but we didn't visit this. It has a bar and is manned by lifeguards for part of the day but is often busy. The dragon slide which features in the brochures is actually in the French Quarter, nowhere near us at all. You can catch a river boat from Riverside that stops at French Quarter and then takes you on to Downtown Disney. This is great in the evenings and very relaxed. They run regularly, so you never wait for too long. I would recommend Riverside to anyone, and was very impressed by how welcoming the Disney staff were, despite the many thousands of people that pass through their doors. The only downside is the water. Even the bottled water has a strong chemical taste. The rooms have a coffee machine but the taste of the water overpowers everything. I recommend purchasing the $11.99 cups in the food hall. Once purchased, you refill them as often as you like throughout your stay. You can also take them into the restaurant and bar. You can't use them in any other resort. The bar is very welcoming to families and there is entertainment from Bob Jackson from Weds to Sat in the evening. Lots of singalong songs and audience participation. If you register your credit card when you check in, you can use your park entrance card to charge meals and shopping to (in Disney areas only). The morning you are due to checkout, an envelope detailing your spending is placed on your room doorhandle and it is automatically debited to your card so you don't have to checkout. This is optional and they will leave a message on your room phone the day before giving you the option of checking out yourself. Most Disney Parks offer the same food - the usual burgers, fries, turkey legs, pizzas etc. I tended just to purchase fruit pots during the day. At Downtown Disney there is a Rainforest Cafe and Planet Hollywood, but get there early if you want a seat or you could look at a 2hr wait. You can reserve a table through Riverside Reception the day before but on the day it is walk in only. Wear comfortable shoes, you do a lot of walking. The Disney Transportation System is very clean, regular and welcoming, giving priority to anyone with mobility difficulties.

And the paths are kind of spooky, especially at night. We called it Camp Creepy, which I know is unfair, but the place after the brightness and fun of Pop Century, and the activity and fun of the Yacht Club, was very subdued, very isolated seeming--felt like we were in a Savannah cemetary at night with fog rising and spooky noises.

Our first trip to this resort was in August 2005, where we stayed in the Port Orleans French Quarter and we loved it! We loved in so much we came back in October 2006 and stayed at the Riverside. The resort is split into the French Quarter and Riverside - the French Quarter has all the atmosphere of New Orleans, with cobbled streets and a carnival atmosphere! The Riverside is about taking things easy on the Big Lazy River! Whatever side you decide to stay on, both are simply lovely! And please note guests have access to both sides of the resort. From the minute you arrive at this resort it feels special. The old style decor in the lobby makes you feel like you have gone back in time! The reception area is in the theme of an old bank, where you talk to the teller to check-in! When you check-in you are given a map to find your room. Please note this is a large resort and depending on where your room is you may have a long walk, so if this does not appeal have a look at the resort map on the Disneyworld website and it will give you an idea of which block is closest to the reception area, and the buses to the parks, and you can request this building when booking. The buildings are split into Aligator Bayou and the great Plantation Mansions. I personally thought that the white mansions were prettier and requested one of these when booking and got one! When you leave the reception area you come outside where there is a beautiful marina, where you can see the mansions in the background. There are lots of wodden bridges and a huge water wheel on the side of the \"eating hole\" which all adds to the wonderful atmosphere. The resort sits on the river which makes it very pretty to stroll around, especially at night. There are lamps that light up the river. My boyfriend and I would often walk to the French Quarter and have a drink in the bar and listen to the jazz music that played on the loud speakers. There is also a horse drawn carriage service, which will take you on a romantic ride around the resort. Perfect! For the kids there are several pools and the fishing hole! Bikes can also be hired and there is the games arcade - lots to keep them occupied! The rooms are reasonably big and spacious, I have stayed at Disney's All Star Movies and the rooms here are a lot bigger. If you are travelling in a family of four, I feel there is plenty of room. As I was travelling with my boyfiend, we had more than enough room! There is an in-room safe, ironing board and hairdryer and of course a lovely big television with all the Disney channels! The room and bathroom were clean, but in hard to reach places further cleaning was required. The eats at the resort are much the same as anywhere else at Disneyworld, good variety and big portions! Please buy the Mickey Waffle for breakfast, made in the shape of Mickey Mouse, a great way to start a Disney day! Another thing I can recommend is buying the Port Orleans Resort drinking cup. For a one off price of $19.99 (the price may have altered) this allows you unlimited drinks for the duration of your stay - tea / coffee / soft drinks at any time of the day. It can only be used in the Port Orleans Resort but we did find we saved a lot of money with this! As well as the standard self service dining, there also is a sit down restaurant at the Riverside, \"Boatwrights\" which serves lovely cajun style food. Where most resorts have only one means of transport to get to the parks - the Port Orleans has another - a river boat ride to Downtown Disney! Its lovely sailing down the Sassagoula river - very relaxing and the driver gives you some Disney facts along the way. Another reason, I feel to pick this resort. The Port Orleans Riverside has all the magic of a Disney resort but has a relaxing feel. If you are travelling as a couple and are looking for a hotel with a romantic setting this is the one! As a moderate resort it does cost a bit more than the value resorts - but it really is worth it. It feels a lot less cramped.

This was our first stay in Florida so we decided to book a disney moderate resort. We arrived at the Riverside very late (long flight delay), and our first impressions were good. The grounds are absolutely beautiful and we had a lovely room in one of the mansion style buildings. The rooms themselves are a reasonable size with two queen size beds. As it was only my boyfriend and I on this trip there was obviously plenty of room - for a family of four I would say that there isn't really enough storage space for your clothes etc. We filled the wardrobe and and all the drawers and there was only two of us! The room itself was also a little dark, not that this really bothered us, we weren't in it that much of the time. Our room was in the middle, but the rooms on the end have an extra window, so maybe they are not quite so dark. One of the restaurants was closed whilst we were there (it was January after all), so only Boatwrights was open. We had two breakfasts in Boatwrights, both which we found to be good value for money (we got 2 dollars to the pound though) and plenty of food for us. We only had one evening meal here which was again great, but we had made a reservation and still had to wait nearly an hour for a table! This was much longer than we waited at any of the restaurants in downtown disney. We were not on the disney dining plan, but found it very easy to make reservations at restaurants via the conceige, or by direct telephone. As it was January, and absolutely freezing the first week we were there, we did not use the pool. We did manage to get the boat to downtown disney a couple of times which made a nice change to the bus. We didn't find the queues for the disney transport to be that busy, and we didn't wait more than 20mins for a bus. Even on the evenings that we watched the fireworks at the Magic Kingdom and Epcot the queue for the bus wasn't very long. I guess this had something to do with it being January! We found the staff to be polite, friendly and helpful, if a little unsure at times. Some of the staff on reception in particular seemed a little inexperienced, but this didn't spoil our stay. With regards to travelling from the UK. We flew with First Choice which was fine (despite the long delay and the completely pointless food voucher of \u00a32.50 - what can you buy with that at Gatwick airport?!) We did use the telephone in the room a couple of times, but I think it would have been cheaper to buy a phone card - the bill was over $100!! In our 2 week stay we spent \u00a3800 between the two of us. This included all our food and drink, souvenirs (such as photos, a scrapbook, clothes...), tips, the phone bill, taxis and tickets for seaworld. All in all I think the Riverside is a good base for a holiday at Disney. The grounds are beautiful, the rooms a nice size, and the food pretty good. If you are planning on spending time in the room then maybe a delux resort would be better, but if you are going to be out all day then a moderate resort like the Riverside is perfect!", "Date": "July 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brick, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cLoved IT!!\u201d", "Author": "disneytravelfanatic", "ReviewID": "UR8133833", "Content": "Once again another Disney Hotel that was magnificant!

Had read all reviews on this site and thought we had made right choice for a moderate resort, which, lets face it is still not cheap when compared to staying off sight. In retrospect we were probably spoilt on our last visit when we stayed at the Dolphin....There is no comparison. Still you get what you pay for. Dont get me wrong we enjoyed our stay. Riverside is in a beautiful setting. There is a main pool and several smaller pools dotted about. The resort was full when we visited. Frustrating that people put towels on beds early in morning and finally arrived at 3pm !! but not the resorts fault. We often used the smaller pool and had no trouble finding beds and much quieter. The resort is, as you would expect with Disney, very well maintained. The grounds are beautiful and loads of wildlife. Very spread out but as surroundings are so special we did not mind the walk. Reception area is superb and attractively designed. The transportation to the parks is very good and the longest we waited for a bus or boat was 20 minutes. When parks close the bus to Riverside does appear to have longest queues ! We really enjoyed the boat trip to Downtown Disney. Me and my lads hired a small boat for an hour or so they thought this was fantastic. Also went 'fishing' which I thought would be a waste of time with a cane and a giant hook, but to be fair they both caught several small fish and again really enjoyed it. The negatives....... When we arrived we had a long walk to our room and no one offered to help us with our cases. I did see other guests being ferried about on golf buggies but no help was offered to us. Expected better service than this. Did not think staff were that friendly. Have seen reports about towels being made into models etc. Never experienced this, think we must have had a grouchy maid ! Rooms not very clean, although we are quite fussy. Several times had to request coffee etc as maid never left any. There was 5 of us. Room is too small for five. Although you don't send much time their it was cramped. Rooms are very dark and appear dingy. I expected better standard. We stayed for 14 nights food okay but starts to get repetitive. Many better places to eat. Boatwrights average. So overall we enjoyed our stay and are already planning our next trip...but not at Riverside.

We have stayed at Disney's Polynesian resort (2 Queen beds + one day bed) previously but only because I found a great 40% off that rate just that one time 2 years ago.)--- Having said that, I know the Riverside is a \"moderate\" hotel and isn't meant to be as grande, but I did expect more for the money I paid. First of all, check-in took us 42 minutes standing in line in the main lobby (they said the computers were down but who knows--they had hardly anyone working the desk with 20 people waiting behind us as well!). Second, when we FINALLY got the room it was VERY cramped. The bathroom is so small that you have to lean over the toilet to shut the door. The recent rains flooded out both the sidewalks to our particular building, so our rolling luggage had to be dragged through a nearby hedge in the mud just to reach our pathway to the right building. The trundle bed is very small--bigger than a crib but too small for my 11-year old--just right for my 9 year old barely. I agree with a previous post that the room cleanliness was much less than I expected for Disney. The privacy curtain helped us deal with dressing for the day but the beds were only full-sized beds and were not that comfortable--not terrible but not good. I like a firm mattress and these were just too firm (cheap). The shower curtain (I stayed in building 19 Alligator Bayou) was molded on the bottom. I like a good walk, but it was a LONG flight for us and it was more than I needed after a long day in the sun with jet lag and a LONG check-in. I looked forward to riding the surrey bikes with my family but be aware that they only rent bikes during a certain time during the day so we never got there (due to all the long lines at the other places). We also looked forward to eating at Boatrights that I had heard was a good on-site restaurant, and we were unable to do that during our stay due to advanced reservations of everone else--make reservations before you leave your home at least a week in advance! It was easier for us to make reservations in Epcot the day before a dinner meal than it was for us to dine at Boatrights all week. To me, it seems that Disney is just packing people in as much as they can and disregarding their comfort as far as ease of dining on property, or crowd control. The pool is small and crowded--very loud--On another note with the pool, there is a small hot tub and many people were allowing their diapered toddlers into the hot water --IKK! I noticed that several of the people allowing their babies into this hot water (unsafe) were speaking foreign languages, so perhaps it is not a health issue in their native areas, but its not only unsafe for babies to be in a hot tub but it's rude to the adults that expect to enjoy it. I was hoping that staying at a moderate hotel would be enough to separate ourselves from that type of behavior--yes I am a hotel snob when I pay $170 a night for a hotel--no offense intended to anyone, I just want my money's worth. On the upside, we heard NO hotel noise from nearby rooms, even when our neighbors with very small kids showed up about midnight each night, {which was better than our experience at the Polynesian where we had to call the front desk to get some teenagers there to stop running around and shouting at 3am but that's another story}. Also, the grounds were beautiful and I highly recommend it for a romantic getaway especially on the Magnolia side--very romantic looking--and my kids liked the boatride to downtown Disney but it was frustrating and hardly worth it because even as early as 4pm all the restaurants had 2 hour wait times for dinner. Disney should \"FAST-PASS\" the Downtown Disney Dining situation!! ON a trival note, my kids like to watch tv before bed and the tv channels you get in the disney resort consist of about four news shows, a couple of sports channels, a couple religious channels, and about five Disney channels and the weather channel and that's it--My kids love the Discovery channel and the HIstory channel and there was not \"good stuff\" to lull them to bed--I know, a trivial point but there it is if it is important to you. For the money, even with the Disney perks, I would not recommend this hotel unless you were just a couple looking for romance and no kids to keep comfortable.", "Date": "July 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port of Orleans Riverside", "Title": "\u201cPort of Orleans\u201d", "Author": "SKH2", "ReviewID": "UR8036554", "Content": "My family and I just got back today from the Riverside Resort. It is a beautiful resort that looks like an old Southern Mansion from the days of Gone with the Wind. As beautiful as it is and the scenery around it, (trees, flowers, gazabos, water, water wheel, ducks, otter, etc) the rooms are average and not overly clean. During our stay there they left a card in our room saying our linens would be changed every 3 days during our stay. Also, they encourage you to reuse towels to help the environment. I want clean towels and sheets everyday when I am on vacation and spending a great deal of money on the vacation. Also, there was mold growing in between our shower curtain in the bathroom and there was a dirty used band-aid on the floor in the bathroom behind the toliet that was NOT ours, and mold in the grout of the tile on the bathroom shower. The resort is very spread out and after a long flight with children they were not able to take us to our room or take our bags to our room even when we asked specifically. We had to drag our children along with their large heavy suitcases pulling them behind. Also, directions to our rooms were not specific enough and we ended up walking much farther than necessary. We requested a room near the food court and was placed quite a ways from there, at least a 5-7 min. walk. If you are not in shape or don't want to walk a long way in the hot hot Florida sun, this is not the place you want to stay. It is beautiful and the landscaping is exquisite, I have the most beautiful pictures. The boat takes you to Downtown Disney every 20 minutes and buses are available to the Parks every 20 minutes or so. The food is average, at best so don't waste your money or dining plan (which is a must and a great money saver) on the food at the Riverside. Wolf Gang Puck's Express is a wonderful place to have lunch in Downtown Disney. I enjoyed not having to deal with airline lines as The Riverside has an airline check in for baggage and boarding passes. However, we waited in line for 1 hour and 10 minutes, which is a long time. Many people behind us had flights very shortly and stood in line so long they were NOT sure if their bags would be sent ahead to the airport. If you use this service do it early in the morning, they start at 5:00 a.m. Our flight left at 5:30 and we got in line at 10:00 and weren't checked in until 11:10. You must check your bags and get boarding passes at LEAST 3 hours prior to your flight. Would I stay here again? Probably not, too much walking after spending many hot days in the theme parks, bathrooms not as clean as possible, employees not overly helpful or friendly, and food so so. If it were more convienent? Yes, the rooms were a nice size, much larger than the Value resorts, had 2 nice comfortable beds, beautiful scenery, good transportation to parks, and a lovely lobby.

I was skeptical, because it looked too boring. I really wanted Port Orleans French Quarter (which was full) or Polynesian or Contemporary Resort (with my fantasy bank account). We went with Port Orleans Riverside, and we were so happy that we did. When we arrived by Magical Express, we were warmly greeted by a castmember, who gave us First Visit buttons as well as a birthday button for our daughter who informed him that she was celebrating a birthday later that week. The lobby was busy, but we were checked in immediately. The downside was that our room wouldn't be ready for several hours (since it was only 9am) and two of the three restrooms in the main building were closed for cleaning --while our 3 year old \"had to go\". After a bit of a wait for the one restroom, we ate at the food court, which had lots of choices and very courteous and patient castmembers. Afterwards, we had a swim in the main pool, which was fabulous. We were able to take the Disney water taxi over to Downtown Disney, which was aprox 15 minutes. When we were given our room assignment, it was in Parterre Place. It was a short walk across the bridge from the main building and food court. There was a quiet pool just outside our door, and laundry facilities were in a building next to the pool. Our room was smallish for $200 a night, but it was pretty and well laid out. There were even a few hidden Mickeys in the decor too! On the days that we used the Disney bus, we ate breakfast and then caught the bus out in front of the main building. We always were able to get seats. One night, we had a dinner reservation at the Fort Wilderness Campground and found out that we would have to take a bus to one of the parks or downtown Disney and then catch another bus to Fort Wilderness. With a small child, this seemed too time consuming, so we asked for a taxi, which was around $10 dollars -- and worth every penny in time savings. While we were in the parks the next day, a surprise autographed photo & birthday card from Donald Duck was left for our daughter in our room. How fun! Checking out, we called the belldesk the night before, and they said to call about 20 minutes ahead in the morning. When we called, they picked up our luggage within 10 minutes (and gave us more buttons and stickers!) Overall, we loved Port Orleans Riverside. It was gorgeous! Even though we were told that they were full, it never seemed like there were that many people. There was plenty to do, with carriage rides in the evenings and they had surrey bikes for rental and boats too. They also had fishing. Even though we had originally wanted to stay at Port Orleans French Quarter, when we actually saw it from the dock, it wasn't as pretty, and the buildings seemed so much more packed together. The grounds at Port Orleans Riverside were incredible and very spacious and luxurious (without being boring!) On the downside, our room always felt slightly damp from the humidity (our swimsuits never dried out). Probably typical of a moderate. I also found a crawly bug on our bathroom floor one night. Otherwise, the room was great --quiet ground floor room, always clean, plenty of towels, no funny smells. Although it has nothing to do with the hotel, during May, all over Disney World we found big black flying bugs --June bugs?

We also used the laundry near our room, which was a very conveniant way of not stinking! The food court was ok.

Rooms are accessed from outdoors and there is limited room service and amenities in the room (thus the term moderate). Some people like the above layout and some people do not - it is something to consider before booking this property. The resort is very spread out and quite large - lots of rooms and many bus stops. There are two sections - the alligator bayou and the mansions (think Southern Rustic and Southern Formal and you get the picture). There are a number of pools throughout the resort and a great main pool (ole man island) especially for the under teenager kids. There are many activities going on for kids, a marina with boat rentals, a pirate jester cruise and cane pole fishing - all things my kids loved to do there. The rooms were reasonably comfortable, well maintained and the landscaping around the bayou was awesome - lots of little ponds, plants, winding footpaths - a very peaceful resort and also nice walkways by the sassagoula river as well. You can hop on a small ferry to Downtown Disney as well. The resort is more expensive (like any other Disney property) than an equivlent non-Disney offsite property. However if the parks are on your priority list this is a great location especially for the Magic Kingdom, Typhoon Lagoon and Epcot and pretty much as far as you can get from the Animal Kingdom and Blizzard Beach. The beds were comfortable - nothing fantastic. There is a mini-fridge in the room along with a small table and two chairs, regular TV with an armoire and a reaosnable amount of clothing storage space as well. All in all a solid choice for those with pre-teen kids or for couples (stay in the mansions area) looking for a nice Disney stay without breaking the bank. The main sit down dining restaurant - Boatwrights - did not impress us for dinner but did have a great breakfast. There is a bar there as well that would appeal to adults looking for a quiet apertif and the food court had a wide selection of choices and had a mill wheel that turned around (the kids loved this) and there was a functional water wheel outside as well.

We usually try to stay on Disney property for the convenience, etc..however, do feel that this place (as others we have stayed at: Caribbean Beach, Dolpin) is nothing special over any other hotel off-site. For the money, actually, it is not worth it. The room was clean, staff friendly enough, but expect the same crowds and wait. I think that if you are going to do the whole \"Disney\" vacation, then absolutely stay on-site and this hotel is fine for that. But if you want to save money and are really only going to use the hotel for sleeping and such, due to spending all your time in the parks, then you'd be just as well off at any hotel near Disney. We really didn't walk the grounds, or see the pools, we just went to the parks and returned to the hotel at night to sleep. The buses (as always) are convenient, but at the savings of $10 a day to park, you have to sometimes stand (we did both days) and with kids, it's hard, especially when you have to go to a few stops before getting to your own....sometimes hardly worth it. Honestly, I could take it or leave it because I don't think the Disney hotels are worth the money you spend (we spent $189 a night). The Port Orleans is in the same class as a Holiday Inn, if that, and you are really only paying for the location and the whole \"Disney\" thing that goes with it.

The weekends are full of dance teams and drill teams, but the weekdays are not crowded at all. This time we brought along my parents and my brother and his friend. My brother stayed at Pop Century while my parents and my husband and I stayed at Riverside. I got that same awestruck feeling I had on our honeymoon when we walked into the main building to check in.

Check in was a little slow, but we were checking in early, about 1100am. The girl was \"earning her ears\" so we gave her the benefit of the doubt. We requested rooms near, but not connected to each other. We got connected rooms, no big deal. Worked out better this way anyway. My husband and I ended up on the 2nd floor with a corner room. The food court was closed for reconstruction, but they did have this great breakfast set up and the food was awesome!!! We didn't have to wait very long at all for any of our buses.

I have this urge to check out the other resorts at Disney World, but I am held back by the fact taht I may not have as enjoyable a stay. I loved the view from our room, I love taking walks.

They even have bike hire and horse and carriage rides through them so that is part of the attraction. The main pool is lovely with a water slide and was warm enough to swim in January. The boat hire is great - all different sizes from 2 man up through 10 man to a big public boat to Downtown Disney. The only problem was the food court closed for refurb. They had a minimal food service and we only used it once as it was poor quality. You can use the court at the French Quarter though. The rooms take 5, although our kids are bigger now and I think next time we will have to move to either 2 rooms or something bigger as we felt a bit squashed.

At check-in, we did not encounter any long lines or delays. The service was very friendly and chatty [a nice departure from last time at the Polynesian (see previous review at the Poly)]. At check-in, I requested a King room if they had any. They did but they did not have one ready right away (it was 10:30am, so not too surprised). She was very apologetic about it even though I didn\u2019t think it was big deal at all. We gave our luggage to the bell staff and left for the parks. Upon our return to property, we got our room number and went to our room. The room was very nice. It was smaller than our room at the Polynesian but that didn\u2019t surprise me, but was plenty big for the two of us. The bed was very, very comfortable. We were in the first building on the Riverside side. We had a very short walk from our door to the lobby area. The ONLY complaint that I have about the property is the fact that the walls are pretty thin. In fact, my wife and I were treated to the symphony of other guests using the facilities. If we had a musical accompaniment, we would have called it \u2018Fartasia\u2019. Again, though, this is a very minor complaint and actually was more funny than annoying. We started our days by having breakfast at Boatwright\u2019s. It was very good. Try the Sweet Potato Cakes with the honey-pecan butter. Yummy!! My wife ordered two eggs for breakfast and when she got her plate, it was overflowing with eggs. She asked me if they were serving Ostrich eggs. The portions are very generous; most could probably split a breakfast. During our stay, we also rented the small water craft and puttered around the river. Very nice. Watch out for the \u201cdock master\u201d who takes you to the boat, gives you your life jacket, etc. He was a bit gruff around the edges.

You pay a little more for these rooms for the perks of being on property, those being: -- Magical Express -- On-Property Transportation (Busses / Boats / Monorail) -- Extra Magic Hours For me, it was more economical to stay on property and make use of the free transportation than pay a minimum of $50 per day for a rental car. Back to the room, there was significant mildew on the shower head and some odd \"purple kool-aid\" looking stuff on some of the shower tiles that came off with some rubbing. So I requested that housekeeping try to clean that ickyness. Unfortunately, they never did, so that was disappointing, especially by Disney standards. The bonus to staying in this particular room is that I think it is the closest room to the East Depot for Disney buses.

It had been a few years since I had been to disney, but going by what I could remember as a child I picked this hotel. It was everything I expected and more. As always Disney went above and beyond to make the trip an enjoyable one. It all starts when Disney's Magical Express loads you onto one of their Deluxe motorcoachs and takes you to your hotel of choice. Be aware that the transfer may take well over an hour and may stop at several other hotels in the same area. It's not such a bad thing as you get to see some of the other hotels you may want to one day stay at! Upon arrival at the hotel I jumped into the check-in line, which can be pretty long around noon. Unfortunatly my room wasn't ready but I was able to leave my bags with the bellman and I had my \"key to the kingdom\" so there was no problem going right to the park. My room was ready, as expected, at 3pm sharp. The resort will give you a number to call as often as you'd like to check on the status of your room. As soon as I opened the door I was pleasently suprised to see my bags had already arrived. Being a travel agent I was aware that somtimes it can take several hours for Magical Express to get your bags to you, but that wasn't the case with me. The rooms at the resort are clean and comfortable, but the resort is large so you can bet on a pretty long walk to the public areas if you do not go with the \"preferred\" room category. The lawns are well manicured and the people you run into along the way are usually friendly so I didn't mind the walk much. I love Disney. My personal opinion: Take the dining plan, and make reservations for the \"must do\" restraunts far in advance. Without reservations it's challenging to get into any of the sit down restraunts. The dining plan saved my boyfriend and I at least a few hundred dollars thorughout the stay. Also buy the refillable mug while at your resort, you will get thirstly laying by that pool and it'll save you money in the long run. Make sure you allow plenty of travel time from this property to any of the four main parks. The buses do run often, but the parks aren't as close as you might think. Also, if you're planning on leaving the park as soon as it closes you're in for a long wait. Throughout most of the day the same bus services both Port Orleans Riverside and French Quarter. On occasion there were two seperate buses running when the parks were closing, but I wouldn't bet money on that. I could say pretty much the same thing about any of the Disney properties i've been to, they're amazing. There's not a better way to go. For those of you who are thinking of staying somewhere off-site, don't bother... even if it does save you a bit in the beginning the experience won't be 1/2 as good and you'll spend a mini fortune once you're there.

It was very late. My husband discovered a baby blanket on the bathroom floor from a previous guest or from the person who \"cleaned\" the room. I called the front desk. They said \"Oh my\" and passed me on to 2 others who basically said the same thing. I asked for another room and got put on hold for quite awhile. I was told no more rooms available. They said someone would pick up the blanket the next day. I told them we were too exhausted to find another hotel and too exhausted to argue anymore that evening. The bed looked clean, so we decided to stay the night. The next morning I decided to try to get some ice. The ice bucket was stuck down to the table. Once again, I called the front desk. \"Yuck\" was their reply. I told them I thought it was coffee and sugar. I also reminded them about the baby blanket on the floor. We don't drink coffee and we did not use the table, but still.... I called and went to the front desk 3 or 4 times about this within the next 2 days. Was told we would have a VIP cleaning with inspection the next day. When we got back, the room appeared clean. Guess what happened after this \"inspected VIP cleaning\" when I lifted the ice bucket? Yep, it was stuck to the table. This time, I wrote a note and stuck it to the bottom of the ice bucket. It's probably still there. Disney, if you're reading this, check room 2416 to see if the ice bucket is still stuck down to the table.... The TV remote also died. Called about that too. They finally brought 1 extra pillow and left a pack of AAA batteries and a different ice bucket. They left a different ice bucket but did not pick the other one up! Go figure. Sticky ice bucket remained and is probably still there. Maybe they weren't strong enough to lift the ice bucket off of the table.... I would advise anyone going to this hotel to take your own cleaning supplies and your own pillows. Might also want to take your own remote batteries. Don't know for sure if this is a management problem or \"got your money and just don't care\" problem or what. Maybe they just don't understand English. The room was clean other than this ice bucket problem. And what was the deal with a baby blanket being on the floor when we got there??? That was so strange. Oh I almost forgot....there was cleaner or something all over the toilet when we got there. I told my husband there was no way I was going to sit on that. My husband used one of their bath towels and cleaned the toilet himself. Poor man. He drove all day then had to clean a toilet. We have never had this bad of an experience with a hotel room. Honestly, we are not picky people. We expected more from Disney. Advice to any future guests of this hotel: 1. Take your own cleaning supplies 2. Take your own pillows 3. Bring extra garbage bag for leftover clothes from the last guests...maybe you can have a garage sale.... 4. Bring your own TV remote batteries...type AAA 5. Take a chill pill and just have fun at the parks.... Seriously, if you need to ask for anyting, go up to the front desk and ask in person. Don't leave until you have what you need. Something gets lost in translation if you ask for it over the phone. Remember....you may ask for it this vacation, but you might not receive it until the next vacation...if there is a next vacation... For Disney's million wishes...I would wish for better hotel management or cleaning for Port Orleans Riverside. We stayed at All Star Sports resort one time. It was a much less expensive room and it was clean. Then again, that was 3 years ago or so. The drawback to All Star Sports is that it was noisy.

The Disney reservations rep mentioned that we could also stay at Riverside because they have trundle beds. We decided to go for it and are so happy we did. We all really loved staying here. The grounds are absolutely spectacular - so lush and full of life. Our requests for a building relatively close to both the lobby and pool as well as on the first level were accommodated without question. The grounds are confusing at first; there are lots of meandering paths and it does take a little while to get oriented to the layout. The main pool and waterslide are terrific and you get to check out (at no charge) life jackets to use during the length of your stay. We did that for the kids and it worked out well. There are several things to take advantage of - fun bicycles (the one we rented fit all six of us; it had a basket on the front for the baby!), boat rentals to cruise around the river, hair braiding, an adventure cruise for elementary aged kids, campfire on Tuesday and Thursday nights, fishing hole, very neat playground, and perfect boat transportation to Downtown Disney.

Unfortunately, when we were there, the food court was closed for remodeling. Instead, they had a buffet that was reasonably priced but not all that great. It was fine for one time but I can't imagine people would have gone back more than once (the menu stayed the same every day). We had the opportunity to see a couple other resorts - Key West and French Quarters - and really liked Riverside much, much more. Riverside has more of a natural, rustic feel to it, which is what we prefer. It's a Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn-like atmosphere. There aren't any bright colors or funky statues at Riverside. It all depends on what you're after though. If you're into Mardi Gras, you'd probably love the French Quarters. Our kids got a big kick out of all the fun and lively statues when we went there for breakfast. Our in-laws stayed on the Plantation side; we stayed on the Alligator Bayou side. Definitely strongly preferred the Alligator Bayou side, which had more lush landscaping and more pleasant walking paths. Tip: If you're taking the shuttle bus to the parks, pick it up at the lobby station. The bus will stop at other places around the resort. The lobby station is the first stop so you should definitely get a seat. After that stop, you may have to stand or wait for another bus. One warning - if you stay here, be prepared to meander your way everywhere. Direct paths were definitely not a priority when they designed this resort. Usually it was fine and actually quite pleasant because the setting is so incredibly beautiful. At the end of the evening when everyone was exhausted and when hauling all the luggage to the lobby for check-out, though, it was frustrating. We would definitely stay here again without hesitation!

We loved it both times. Upon entering the hotel you are greeted by a large and beautifully decorated sign in area that is designed like the inside of a 19th century riverboat. The sign in staff are friendly and there are pleny of people working to check you in. After you check in you get your \"keys to the kingdom\" which are how you get into everything at Disney, including your room. The rooms are spacious. We have 5 and Riverside has a trundle in addition to the 2 double beds. The furniture at Riverside is rough hewn log with the bark still on it. The decorations are very cozy and the rooms are very well maintained. Our area was a good hike to the main building where the dining and check in are. The food was good - as good as anything in Disney. We didn't bother with the 10 dollar mug. Some people think its a great deal, but we didn't want to fool with carrying it everywhere. If you want a really good meal go to the Trails End restaraunt at the campground. They have a very good buffet that isn't outrageously priced. The hotel has various pools spread out across the property and our room was near one of them. The pool was clean, they had a hot tub too. It wasn't too crowded and of course everyone is happy to be there. I find it interesting to talk to people in these areas because they all have their own story about how they love Disney. The grounds of the property are very well maintained. They had replaced virtually every wooden structure (benches, bridges, handrails, etc) with that artificial wood which is very durable and long lasting. Our room was a short wooded walk to the nearest bus stop. Our kids made a game out of counting lizards every time we went that way. One thing I liked about this resort was you could take a bus or a boat to Disney. They also have bikes, canoe, paddle boats, and peddle cars that you can rent to ride around the property. We didn't do this the second time around but if you wanted to take breaks from the parks they are a nice diversion. If you have that odd number of 5 people, and are on a budget, then this is the absolute best place to stay at Disney. We are going this year (April 2007) but are going to have 6 this time around so we had to reserve at the Pop Century... but my kids could care less and I know we are going to love it no matter what.

Plenty of lighting, temperature control worked very well and water pressure was good. Forget about the closet in these rooms, it's too close to the sinks to be of any use and doesn't have doors. Mini fridge was appreciated. There's no room service but one can order pizza, and it's pretty good. Food court is closed, but they do offer a limited selection of items.

This review of Port Orleans Riverside (POR) comes from the perspective of a straight couple (us), a gay couple (my best friend and his partner, who flew in from L.A.), and a single gal (my friend), so hopefully, no matter who you are, you\u2019ll find something interesting about this review! SNAPSHOT: Pros \u2013 Great flexibility when it came to room requests; excellent theming. Cons \u2013 Dirty towels outside our door for a couple of days. The Bottom Line \u2013 Having stayed at all three moderate level Disney hotels, this is officially my favorite. ARRIVAL/CHECK-IN From the minute you walk in the door at POR, you are transported to the Old South. The grand foyer is bright, with ample lighting and soothing d\u00e9cor that at once makes you feel at home. We arrived around 11:30 a.m. on a Saturday, and there were wall to wall people. Be aware that you get in the proper line \u2013 we were waiting in line for about 10 minutes (the line formed immediately inside the main door) before I sent my husband to the actually check-in area to se if we were in the correct line. Turns out, there were two lines: one for hotel check-in, and one for people who were checking out of the hotel and checking their baggage into the Disney Cruise line. I would suggest that if there are massive amounts of people in the lobby when you get to POR, have someone from your party find the location of the correct line. Disney could help with this by having signs or a cast member to direct traffic. Once we got in the correct line, the check-in process only took about 15 minutes from beginning to end. There were about 20 people ahead of us, but there were cast members helping folks along at this point so that helped. The woman who checked us in went out of her way to be helpful, especially since I\u2019d wanted to stay at Alligator Bayou. The problem? My best friend had flown in the day before and had checked into a Mansion room (POR is set up as two sections: Alligator Bayou \u2013 more rustic looking rooms, and the Mansions \u2013 more elegant, stuffy looking rooms). Lucky for us, the two types of accommodations are within spitting distance of each other, so we all got the rooms we wanted, and my best friend was a four minute walk from our room to his Mansion, Acadian House. Once the rooms were sorted out, we began the trek to our room in Building 38, which was about an eight minute walk from the front desk. ROOM QUALITY Which room you select all depends on your taste, though both types, Alligator Bayou and Mansions, are impeccably themed. Alligator Bayou has a rustic look to it (see pictures located at http://new.photos.yahoo.com/kvichko22/album/576460762387255041), while the Mansions, in my opinion, go for a more elegant, refined look. As someone who likes to feel comfy and at home, I knew the Alligator Bayou was more up my alley, and I\u2019m glad to say the room didn\u2019t disappoint. It had your two standard beds (they said the beds are queen, I\u2019d argue they\u2019re double beds \u2013 which seem to be a bit smaller), and a twin size trundle bed under one of them. The beds were very comfortable, and you sank ever so slightly into them. There\u2019s a good size twin sink area, and I liked that each sink was a pedestal sink that stood on its own, so you really could have up to three people getting ready at once (which we did each morning). I really liked the detail in the green and mosaic tile floor, which followed through to the bathroom. The room size itself accommodated three adults comfortably, and we could have fit a fourth adult in there with no problem. A trick I learned on our honeymoon that I used here was well worth it \u2013 at check-in, ask for a corner room because you get two huge windows that make the room seem so much larger. We had a TV hidden away in the cabinet, and our room came with a nice little fridge, which held our drinks and chocolate I\u2019d bought at the U.K. in Epcot. The housekeeping service did a great job in the room, though I will note that at the bottom of our stairs each day there seemed to be a towel or washcloth that somehow didn\u2019t make it into Housekeeping\u2019s laundry pile. No big deal, so we called the Front Desk, and Housekeeping came and got it. It kept happening for our first three days, though, so by the fourth day we were a smidge put off. By then, Housekeeping knew our names, so they actually went into our account and comped our dinner at Boma for the inconvenience. How nice of them! On a final note, once again, the refillable mugs that you can buy at Boatwright\u2019s are completely worth the price (when we were there it was about $11.99 each). The three of us took turns each day going down in the morning to fill them up, and then at night we\u2019d do it again and keep them in our fridge. TIME OF YEAR We went end of September to beginning of October, and there weren\u2019t a ton of people. Besides the check-in confusion and mass people, the resort itself was quiet and not too crowded. We didn\u2019t wait too long at Boatwright\u2019s for dinner, nor were the walking paths or pool overflowing with people. ON-SITE TRANSPORTATION The bus system, as usual, rocked. We always got where we needed to go with ample time to spare. We did rent a car, though, and I must say if you can afford it, do it, because parking at the parks is included in your room price, and it is quicker to get around. OUR PACKAGE Disney offered the free dining plan with purchase, and we booked that. As on our honeymoon, we did lunch at about 11:30 a.m. and dinner around 6:30 p.m. so we ended up paying very little out of pocket. I will say that the new dining plan (1 table service, 1 counter service, and 1 snack) pales in comparison to the Wishes we used in 2004, but I\u2019m sure that\u2019s just the nature of Disney tweaking the plan so that they don\u2019t lose too much money. At the end of the day, it\u2019s still a great deal, and it saved us quite a bit of money! All in all, we loved POR, and are now torn between POR and Caribbean Beach for our next visit! We cannot recommend it highly enough, especially for heading down to the World with friends!

This is a very large resort, comparable to Carribean Beach in size. However, it is well dispersed and the grounds are extremely peaceful and well manicured. I have no idea what the garden maintenance budget must be but I guess it's huge. Port Orleans Riverside (POR) is the sister resort to the French Quarter which is about a 10-15 minute walk down river (and is a very nice walk too). The 'river' is actually more of a canal but is very wide, calm and winding and the resort is on both sides. We stayed at Alligator Bayou (AB), which are more informal buildings (2 storey, we stayed on the ground floor - no lifts here). The Food Courts and reception/shop are on the same side of the river between POR and FQ. The 'marina' is also alongside reception and this is where you can catch the boat to Down Town Disney and West Side. On the other side of the river are the 'mansions' which go up to 3 storeys and have lifts. In case you are wondering, the rooms are all the same size regardless; the decor is slightly different depending on whether you choose AB or Mansions. AB has a 'Disney Rustic' theme with patchwork quilts, faux wooden fixtures etc. The main difference is the landscaping - AB is informal, with winding paths, lots of foilage, little ponds etc whereas the Mansions are formally landscaped. I preferred AB as it seemed a little more \"tucked away and private\". We were in building 18 and did not have far to walk to the reception/entertainment areas. It's worth noting that, if you don't like walking, you'll need to be sure to ask for a room closer to the food courts. I notice a lot of comments are about the size of this resort and the potential for \"remoteness\" from the main buildings. Frankly, compared to the walking you'll be doing around the parks, I have to say this is a bit daft. Even at the far end of the resort you are really less than 10 minutes leisurely walk away - and it's a really nice, peaceful walk as well. I should put this review in context - we've (2 adults) previously stayed at hotels on Hotel Plaza Boulevard at Downtown Disney. Whilst decent enough, the 'on Disney Resort' experience was unbelievably better and the cost was not much more. We will only stay on Disney property from now on. The convenience in terms of transportation, extra hours at parks, friendliness factor and the overall holiday feeling were amazing. We did not eat at the food court although we picked up the odd takeout. The food in all honesty is just 'OK' but nothing special - mainly fast food with fairly large queues at busy times and is not particularly good value (Disney prices). Having said that, I can see how it would be useful for many families to top up before heading out. The restaurant was better although you really need to book. I had a very decent meal there. Look out for the freshly baked cinnamon buns in the bakery at the foodcourt too - available in the mornings and still warm and sticky. Yum. If you have a car, also consider Dennys for a large breakfast once in a while - more taste and half the cost and will keep you going till afternoon. There is also an arcade for the kids, boat hire of varying types (take a ride all the way to DTD is you want), a bar with a very entertaining guy (Bob the piano man who has you laughing and on your feet again in the evenings), and a decent enough shop with essentials and gifts. The rooms in all honesty are nothing special but are far from poor - they are comfortable for 2 adults but would guess they become more crowded for families. The beds were fine (trundle beds available in AB), the TV worked, the refrigerator was fine and you don't pay extra for the privilege, there are 2 washbasins and a smallish (but perfectly adequate bathroom with WC and overhead shower. The maid service we had was outstanding and had some nice touches too. It was my wifes birthday and a nice sculpture out of facecloths was made with a few flowers inside - on one occasion we also came back to find our 'Eeyore' and a Richard Branson teddy bear watching the TV, together with remote control in hand (they were watching the Disney Channel). We had no problems with unsatisfactory cleanliness as has been noted in some of these reviews. Regardless of the room sizes, I have to say that we woke up, showered and slept in them - we were out most of the time. If you are thinking of spending a lot of time in your room, go somewhere with bigger rooms. But why would you want to spend all your time in your room when out here? Transportation here was OK - at least when heading out to the parks. No longer than a 10-15 minute wait, and there are 4 stops around this resort. Coming back when the parks were closing was a different story - huge queues and up to 30 minute waits or more. I think the issue needs to be addressed. At other times it was fine. (TIP: the queues for FQ were a lot shorter - hop on one of those and walk from FQ to POR. If you have a car, consider driving as you are entitled to free parking). The boat ride to downtown Disney was great and we used it 6 or 7 times. Relaxing, peaceful, lots of wildlife and the odd yarn during the trip from the \"salty sea dog captain\". It's also worth mentioning there is plenty of wildlife in the resort (rabbits, ducks, birds of all descriptions). We only used the main pool once, It gets busy and you may also like to consider there are 5 more 'quiet pools' around the resort (3 in AB and 2 at the mansions). The pools were fine; if you get in early enough you may be sharing with the odd duck. Word of caution - lifeguards are only at the main pool. You can also share the pool at FQ if you wish. In summary, the theming of this resort is very natural. It's large but spread out and seems quiet in the grounds at all times. The food court is busier and more frenetic during \"rush hour\". The grounds are beautiful and worth walking around. The transport is generally good but watch out for peak times when it's fairly poor. The rooms are adequate and comfortable. The staff were friendly. If you've stayed \"off-Disney\" before, you'll be surprised what a difference it makes to be in the \"magic\"!

WE had originally booked the Port Orleans - French Quarter resort, but when we went to check-in they had no 'non-smoking' rooms available. As my children are highly sensitive to smoke, Disney was very accomodating and found us a non-smoking room at its sister property, Port Orleans-Riverside. We are local to the area (Tampa), but wanted our kids to experience staying on a Disney property. Our room was nice, but a bit small. There were two full size beds. One of the beds had a pull-out trundle underneath, which was good for our 3 yr old as the regular bed was pretty high off the ground and we were worried he might fall out. He was not terribly fond of staying in the trundle, so the next night we ordered bed-rails from housekeeping with no problem. There was a small fridge in the room which was nice to keep cold drinks or whatever. The bathroom area was ok, but also fairly small. It had two pedestal sinks and a built-in blow dryer. There was also an in-room safe. The property itself was nice, but we weren't there long enough to really check it out or enjoy it. We did eat at the food court restaurant one night and it was ok. One of the perks of staying 'on property' is the accessibility to the parks 'magic hours', which during our stay included EPCOT (stayed opened 3 hours after normal closing time for Disney resort guests). We thought that was nice & were planning to take advantage of this, but our kids were much too tired to stay up that late :( . We did not use Disney transportation because we thought by the end of each day the kids would just want to get back the resort w/o dealing w/waiting for transportation. Since we were a resort guest we did not have to pay to park at the parks even though we drove our own car, which was a nice perk as parking at the parks is $10/day. The only real issues we had with POR are (1) that at the time we were staying there, a large convention of Pop Warner athletes were staying there as well and the kids were rowdy and noisy until all hours of the night and (2) the toilets flush Very Loudly in both your own room & you can hear them in other nearby rooms as well. Though it was nice to stay 'on property' I think there are several resorts in & around Lake Buena Vista that are also nice & offer a better value than staying on Disney property (our in-laws stayed at Hawthorne Suites in LBV & had a much bigger place w/a bedroom, separate living room area, kitchenette, etc. for about $50 less per night). Lastly, we went to the Disney's Very Merry Christmas Party one night & though it was nice, I don't think it is worth the extra money to attend.", "Date": "December 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scranton, PA", "Title": "\u201cVery nice Disney Property!\u201d", "Author": "Pudge", "ReviewID": "UR6349713", "Content": "The last time my wife and I were at Disney was 1993 and until now have never stayed on-site. We booked our room at our local AAA office and received a discounted rate for 9 nighs. The Port Orleans Riverside is a beautiful resort. It has a very peaceful setting and a river runs through it. Before booking, we were debating whether to stay here or Coronado Springs and were glad that we chose Port Orleans. We visited Coronado Springs out of curiousity and although it is nice, I think we would have gotten sick of it after a few days. The Port Orleans Riverside resort has two themed areas - The Alligator Bayou and The Mansion section. We requested a room in the mansions and received it, although we ran into one snag. Being both non smokers (the majority of the rooms are non smoking), we requested and received a non smoking room overlooking the river. Upon entering the room, it reaked of smoke. Why on earth would someone smoke in a non smoking room and spoil it on everyone else? Anyway, my wife suffers from asthma and could not stay in this room. We finally ended up with another room facing the river that did not smell, in fact it was very clean. After this minor setback, the rest of the trip was smooth sailing. We were not on the meal plan and did not use Disney transportation so I cannot comment on those things. We like to have a car to be able to come and go as we please. We did eat in Boatwrights one night and the food was just ok. We preferred the food court at the French Quarter over Riverside. The rooms have a small refigerator, iron and board, and in room safe. It is also a big plus having two separate sinks. It is very nice walking around the resort early in the morning or late at night. The resort has a very relaxing feel to it and is well shaded.

Our family stayed at Port Orleans on a similar trip two years ago and we were delighted to return to this wonderful resort. The resort is quite large and far flung, which has advantages and disadvantages, as others have noted. Advantages: buses come frequently and we never had to wait long, no matter where or when we were going; landscaping is beautiful and wildlife bountiful; relative quiet. A disadvantage is that sometimes it can be quite a long walk from guest room to dining, front desk and other services, with long waits at peak times. Check in was efficient and my son watched movies on the TV in the lobby while I got situated. Had to return when I inadvertently deactivated my room card a few days later (tip: don't let your key card get near your magnetic clip-on sunglasses!) and also got through quickly. Our room was in Alligator Bayou 35. We found the room comfortable and clean. Each room now contains a mini-refrigerator, which ran a bit cold but did the job. There is a coffee maker with free coffee packs to make your own java. Housekeeping left my son quite a towel menagerie, to his delight. Lots of choices on the TV, of course heavy on the Disney/ABC offerings. We had a guest laundry and pool nearby which were never crowded and quite inviting. I was amazed at how quiet the room was, given that a Pop Warner football/cheerleading competition was going on at the time of our visit, with many large groups in our area. We never heard a peep once inside our room. My only disappointment was our one meal at the food court -- definitely nothing to rave about. But with so many dining choices at Disney, most of which we loved, it was a small problem for us. On a more general note, we found this to be a great time to visit Disney -- the Christmas decorations enhance the magic, but the crowds are light and the parks very enjoyable. Overall, I think this property is an excellent value for the money. I can't compare Port Orleans to other Disney Resorts -- since we discovered this one, we have not been tempted to stay anywhere else!

I made my reservations in June and the Disney Travel Agent was telling me that each room is cleaned top to bottom, including NEW, CLEAN bedspreads, before a new guest checks in. Well, I'm one of those hypergermaphobs and I felt that for once, I could stay at a hotel and not be preoccupied with wiping down every surface before I touch it! WRONG Anyway, we get to the hotel, Thansgiving night around 6. There are only 2 people working the check in desk and 5 working the Concierge desk. I waited in line 20 minutes or so and was helped by a young lady earning her ears. Check-in went smoothly enough. Drove to our room, Aligator Bayou Lodge 18, room 1809. We didn't know how to have anyone help us with our luggage (BELL SERVICES ONVIOUSLY) and we made 5 trips from the parking lot to our room. No big deal, been in the car all day! The ROOM: OK, given the expectations I had about the cleanliness of the room - I about cried when I saw it. The carpets hadn't been vacuumed from the previous occupants, the refrigerator door had smudges on it, there was toothpaste on the ledge, soap in the sink, dirt and hair on the floor, etc. etc. I called the front desk to complain, they couldn't switch us to another room, so they sent housekeeping. WONDERFUL ladies. Bent over backwards to please me. My anxiety level contained, my husband, daughter and I ventured to the hotel to eat. BTW, the room was great when we came back. However, I can't believe I didn't notice that they put us in a SMOKING ROOM until I was in bed. I requested Non Smoking........... My fault for not noticing.... Make sure you purchase the dining plan - so worth it. Food court food pretty good. Make sure you purchase the refillable cup. Worth the money. The world famous WDW customer service didn't rear its beautiful head to those we interacted with. However, the people who went out of their way to be pleasant and smile are the ladies who cleaned our room the first night, Claudinette in the hotel gift shop and Michelle from Howell, MI with housekeeping. The grounds of the hotel were beautiful. Wish I had more time to walk around. The buses were not a problem. We got where we needed to go without a problem. However, the cleanliness of the monorail late at night was GROSS!!!!! And some of the attractions at the Magic Kingdom were littered and dirty. Very disappointed in the cleanliness in general.

This was my third visit to WDW and my boyfriends tenth time but our first experience of staying on Disney property. Disney has excelled itself with elegant buidings in a beautiful setting. We paid for an upgrade to a king room and it was well worth it. Other reviews have commented that the rooms at this hotel are small but this was not the case for us. Again other reviews have commented on the large amount of walking involved but we did not find this to be the case - maybe we were lucky as we stayed in Parterre Place just over the bridge from the main buildings. We found the room to be clean on arrival and it was by enlarge kept that way, but by the end of the 3 weeks the floor could have done with a vacuum! A cute addition was the ghost made out of a face cloth which stayed in our window the whole holiday. We also were left a couple of animals made from towels which is a really nice touch. One thing I thought was very good about housekeeping was that on two occasions we stayed in the room and put out the 'privacy please' sign and were not disturbed at all, yet clean towels, soap etc. were left hanging on the door - this was unexpected but to me displayed good customer service. Following our late afternoon arrival and smooth check-in (a short wait) we visited Boatwrights restuarant and were pleasantly surprised at both how quiet it was and how good the food was (French Onion soup and Jambalaya). During the stay we visited the food court on a couple of occasions and found the queues to be long and the serving staff dis-interested. The food was adequate albeit overpriced (although this was not a surprise). A must is the resort refillable mug if you will be staying more than a couple of days - you will easy make your money back and it's so good not to have to join a queue at Disney!!!! We used the boat to Downtown Disney once (in the evening) and enjoyed the relaxing journey - would recommend. We also booked a carriage ride around the resort but unfortunately the night we booked for ended up being windy and rainy (infact there was a tornado watch!) so it was cancelled and we just ran out of time to use the rebooking offered to us. As we didn't use any of the resort buses we can't comment on the service. We also rented a surrey bike and cycled round the resort which was enjoyable. We did encouter two problems with the check in desk. For a couple of reasons we had two seperate bookings of 10 days. When we checked in we made this clear and requested to stay in the same room for the whole 20 nights (as advised by Disney Reservation staff when the bookings were made). We were asked to visit the front desk on the day to check out and check in again. This wasn't as straightforward as it should have been and it was left to us to spot that we had been given resort keys for the first part of the stay again. This could have caused a problem if we hadn't checked and had just gone straight to use them in a park etc. It also wasted half an hour of the day. The second problem was a billing error for the first part of the stay which although not shown on the statement delivered to the room, was deducted from our credit card - this was quickly resolved when brought to their attention. Overall, staying on Disney property was a great experience but we will not be staying there again as for us the benefits (EMH, transport, charging to room key etc.) are outweighed by the extra cost (we would rather be able to visit Disney more and stay off property to make our dollars stretch that bit further!!).", "Date": "November 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cConvenient, but at a price\u201d", "Author": "r_ling", "ReviewID": "UR6122839", "Content": "Awesome stay for 2 weeks.

Suitcases were already in room, having arrived on an earlier flight! Room was a lot more spacious than anticipated. After reading reviews about small rooms we were apprehensive. Dining table, 2 lounge chairs, king bed, TV, open wardrobe next to two sinks, plus bathroom/toilet. Riverside is a large compound, with 4 bus stops around the perimeter. Main bus stop was close to the block we got put in - block 17. Some may have to walk a distance to get to the dining room/lobby depending on the block you got put in. Rooms are clean, and the cleaner does a commendable job. The little one loves the folded animals left on the bed every night. On the occasions where the cleaner forgot, a quick phone call, and house keeping would deliver the 'surprise'. Room was adjacent to the small pool. Noise from the pool not a factor, as the loud A/C drowned out everything else! I slept through the noise, but Mrs was disturbed by the noise. Ended up just using the ceiling fan at night. Main pool situated behind the main building, and involved a walk of some 3-400 meters. Good slide for the kids. Checked out some of the pools on other resorts - the pool at French Quarter looks awesome, and great in photos, but the slide was decidedly short. Bus system for the resort was very efficient. One may not get a seat at peak times, and only ever had to miss one bus because it was full, and that was immediately after the closing of Magic Kingdom. Ferry to Downtown Disney via French Quarters also used frequently. If I were to criticise anything, it would be the food. They tend to be overpriced, and loaded with fat. After 2 weeks of eating the same fried stuff, we were desperate for some home cooked meals. The dining room was never crowded, and clean all the time.

Stayed from Nov.2nd - Nov. 8th. Our first time staying at the Port Orleans Riverside. Made the trip from Colorado with hubby, and three kids! Must admit, I mostly picked this resort because it was the only moderate that slept five. However, having been born in New Orleans, I was also interested in the theme. I had read a lot of the previous reviews on this hotel, and wasn't sure exactly what we would end up with! We have always stayed on grounds. A couple of times in the deluxe hotels and on our last visit we stayed at the All Star Sports....(that one did not impress us at all!) So we hoped a moderate would be better! Port Orleans was a big improvement. Used the magical express bus service from the airport. The line at service desk, and to board the buses were quite long! I was surprised because it was supposed to be a \"slow\" time of the year. ( I am beginning to think there are no longer any \"slow\" times) It was still very nice to use the bus service and they show a nice video as you ride. Once at the hotel-check in didn't go as smoothly as I would have hoped. None of my requests worked out. They had us in the mansion section, which does not have the trundle beds...(remember we had 5 people) so they changed us over to alligator bayou. I had also requested to be close to the main building...that didn't end up happening either. We ended up in building 26. However, when I saw the grounds and the room, I couldn't be mad! (Besides how can you be mad when you're at Disney?!) The grounds are very pretty. The buildings are really nice, almost like little apartments. They are set far enough apart and with so many trees and bushes, that from our room we couldn't even see another building. It is a LARGE complex and there is ALOT, repeat ALOT of walking....and the layout is slightly confusing, but if you are prepared in advance it's no big deal. Our room was clean, and I felt like we had plenty of space. At one point our blow-dryer conked out, and they had a new one installed within hours! We had the dining plan so we didn't use the food court area too much. The hotel has character, and is comfortable, and homey. Of course the kids loved the gift shop and the arcade. The kids got to see an armadillo one night, an animal we don't have in Colo.! We spent one evening at the River Roost to catch Bob the piano guy. It was a blast! Buses seemed to be a little slow this trip...Took usually 15-20 minutes to catch the one we wanted...and did have many times we had to stand. Tried the boat ride one evening to downtown Disney, it was a nice ride...allow about 20 minutes down and 20 minutes back. I really would recommend this hotel it is very pretty, however because of how busy Disney has become....I think our next visit we will go back to a monorail hotel.

Those reviews were right, especially if you want romance and this is a trip for just you and hubby or someone special! The grounds of the resort were very well groomed and maintained. I did not know this but all Disney Resorts are even gated! That was a nice bonus as well. The rooms were very neat because of the theming. You really did feel like you were on vacation somewhere on the Mississippi! Ol Man Island pool was kept clean and refreshing although for some reason it wasn't heated even though I was told it was.

I had the Philly cheese steak which tasted just as good as any philly cheesesteak I have ever had. My husband had a double cheeseburger and exclaimed, \"Yep, it's real meat!\" He said it was pretty good :) We also shared a chocolate icing brownie from the bakery which honestly did taste like it wasn't too fresh, maybe made earlier that day. It was still not bad at all! Previous complaints of the toilet flus being loud are true. They are loud and will wake you up, guaranteed! Also previous complaints of the rooms being \"dirty\" are somewhat true as well. Like I said, the rooms were nice and well themed but they did seem a little dust laden. The paint on the walls definetely needs to be freshened up. It appears they focus their upkeep more on the exterior than the interior, I will say that. All in all, this is the only reason I gave this resort 4 stars as opposed to 5! The minor room flaws but thats it! It's just an older, moderate resort, that's all!

There was no waiting for Magical Express or at check in. In fact, we didn't encounter any lines at all. We stayed in room 9298 of Oak Manor and really appreciated the private pool. After a long day at the parks, it was nice to enjoy a quiet swim without tons of shouting kids. Boatwrights was awesome. Their herb crusted chicken is to die for! And at 4pm the piano player comes in and the whole resturaunt and bar start hopping. It was soooo much fun! As this was our 6th stay at POR my dd and I tried to do all new things. We rented bikes and biked over to French Quarter for swimming and lunch, took the horse drawn carriage ride around the resort, did the bonfire and campout and even rented the small watercraft to boat up and down the Sassalouga River. We really has a fabulous time. Housekeeping was wonderful our room was extremely clean. The only negative was that we had a 5a.m. Magical Express pickup and the airline check-in station didn't even open until 5a.m. so we couldn't take advantage of that convience. A hint to all newcomers to POR, we bring cereal, plastic bowls and spoons in our luggage and buy a milk at Fulton (the general store). As all rooms have complimentary refrigerators, it makes more sense than spending $3.00 on a small box of cereal at the counter service and wasting a dining option.

Overall, we enjoyed the hotel and the disney experience. We would return to hotel again in the future. Some NEGATIVES: Disney seemed short-staffed which caused slowness and lines...one needs to bring patience with them on vacation here. Most counters, registers and food court areas seemed to only have one employee and as soon as that person would leave to look into something, a line would quickly form. Upon check-in, we were given a handicap room. Luckily, the man told us that meant the room had no tub. This was unacceptable to me because I take baths. Initially, he was saying the hotel was booked and had no other rooms. This bothered me since I made the reservation 6 months prior and neither of us were seniors or handicap...so I don't understand why we were given a handicap room. After about 20 mins, the man did find us a regular room. Also, I asked for an extra pillow upon check-in and was told they didn't have any. Then I asked if I could get one the next day and I was told they still might not have one. I found this annoying... why doesn't Disney just buy a few thousand extra pillows for their hotels?! There did end up being a spare pillow in the room. After check-in, we had no issues with the hotel. The rooms could use new carpeting and new tubs...they are getting worn. They only give soap and a small shampoo, so if you need conditioner or mouthwash bring your own. The gift shop and downtown disney stores don't have a good selection of personal care items ...no zantac, no soap, no saline solution, no nyquil...so bring these things if you might need them...otherwise you have to go off disney property to buy them. And going off disney property requires a car. I recommend renting a car. We were in building 95 of the southern mansion section. It was the furthest building and took us about 15 mins each way to walk to lobby and food areas. Also, be sure to buy anything you need by 10pm, when the gift shop and food court close. There is an old vending machine near each building but it only has some chip selections on top and cans of soda on bottom...doesn't even have water. Some POSITIVES: No need to call housekeeping at all. Room was kept clean and new supplies were provided daily. We found no bed bugs, which was a concern after reading some reviews. The disney magical express was wonderful. Our bags were delivered directly to our room from airport and then from hotel lobby to airport upon check-out. We were also able to get boarding passes right in the lobby. So convenient. We used the disney buses, boats a few times to go to various areas. We didn't wait more than 10 mins and didn't find them overly crowded, but we did prefer using the rental car. The food was amazing. Boatrights was great for dinner. I wouldn't recommend breakfast at Boatrights though cause it isn't much different than the food court and requires using a \"dinner\" option with the meal plan. Food court requires a \"counter service\" option. The food we had at disney was some of the best food we ever ate in our lives. RECOMMENDATIONS: Visit the food court and pool at French Quarter for a change of scenery and it is less crowded than Riverside.

Check in was fine - we arrived around 10:00am and were happy to find our room ready, but the person at the front desk who was \"earning her ears\" was not really helpful. She was very nice but did little more than give us our room keys - there was no explanation about what how to take advantage of property amenities. Our room was in the Arcadian building (I'm not sure what number that is), and it was about a 10 minute walk from check in with our suitcases. The room was a standard hotel room with two full sized beds and a decent sized bathroom with a separate area holding the two pedastal sinks. As mentioned in other reviews, the property is very pretty, and well kept. There are rabbits and frogs and lizards running all over the place, which is fun. Our room was spotless and comfortable, and our mousekeeper did a great job. She didn't leave us any animals, but did create a \"cup\" out of washcloths, and stuck our toothbrushes in it, which was cute. We ate in the dining hall for breakfast one day and dinner another evening. The food was surprisingly good, with a nice selection of items, and all of the staff members were very friendly. The other two mornings we ate at the table service restaurant, boatwrights, and we had the banana stuffed french toast - it was FABULOUS!! It is two huge pieces of texas toast, with a banana in the middle, which is then deep fried, coated in cinnamon and sugar, and served with a strawberry banana sauce. So yummy! We took a horse-drawn carriage ride one night ($35 for 24 minutes) which was relaxing and nice - the driver took us over to the French Quarter property for a different view. We also took advantage of the boat service to downtown disney, which was very convenient. The only transportation problem we had was due to some misinformation we were given by the front desk. We had dinner reservations at Boma one night, at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. We called the front desk to find out how to get there and were told to take a bus, which should come by every 15-20 minutes. After waiting literally 1 hour and 15 minutes (well past our reservation time), my husband called the front desk and was told that there are no buses from resort to resort. The concierge we spoke with was kind enough to come pick us up at the bus stop and drive us to dinner, which saved the night. Other days we took the bus to the parks with no incident, and very little wait. It is nice to stay at Riverside, as it is the first pick up stop, with people staying at the French Quarter getting picked up second. We used the Disney's magical express back to the airport, which was quick and convenient, and I recommend it. Would we go back to Port Orleans Riverside? Probably not, but only because I think next time we would like to spend a little more and have a hotel that was a little more centrally located to the parks, and involved a lot less walking to get to the restaurant and gift shop.

That is how I came to choose the Riverside resort. The trip included my three daughters (16,13,6) and myself. It has become a \"girls only\" holiday for us and we try to make it to Disney World at least twice a year. This time we were there from Sept. 24th -30th. I was a little worried about some of the earlier comments but want to assure you this is an awesome resort. Lets get to the good stuff... We used the Magical Express and it was very speedy. No waits at the airport and there were only two other couples on our bus to the resort. Check in was great and Ann was a dear. We checked in but because we were so early, 9 am, our room was not ready. No problem, we would wait because they had us booked in building 14, the most desired location on property. Thrilled we decided to wait in the lobby. Well, one of the girls needed to get to the room due to becoming ill. I went back and they found us a room in building 17 that was available. Thank you!! When we arrived at the room it was freshly cleaned from top to bottom. My daughter needed her bags and they were brought to the new room within the hour. Again, great!! I can't say enough about our maid who cleaned our room spotless everyday. She left the 6 year old a towel doll, complete with legs, dress and even a bead necklace. The next day the doll was left with a puppy dog. Oh my too cute. The rooms were more than large enough for all of us and we did take advantage of the trundle. A nice suprise because I hadn't requested it. The ac and fridge were ice cold and we never heard a peep from anyone or any toilet as some had stated before. The grounds we found to be as clean and well kept as the room. We had a quiet pool right outside our room which was a nice end to a long day at the parks. We never waited more than 15-20 minutes for a bus from the resort or from any of the parks. But, had to stand on numerous occassions because the bus was so packed. We found the food court to be very good and do take advantage of the refillable mugs and dining plan. You will save lots of money. Make your reservations early for the best chances of eating where you want. I highly reccommend having breakfast in Cinderella's castle. We love you David. It was the best time at a meal we had during our entire stay. The food was delicious and you can't beat the atmosphere. We attended the halloween party which required a seperate ticket. Again, purchase your seperate tickets to any event early. It was awesome!! We all dressed up and let me tell you, the headless horseman was amazing. The rider can't see a thing. The horse is trained to run the whole parade route on his own with no help from the rider. I would have paid just to see that. It was tons of fun and disney does a wonderful job at doing it up right. The lines at the park were fast moving as well and the only real wait we had was for splash mountain which was 30-45 minutes. The girls just walked up to ride Everest a few times with no wait. Wow. Now lets get to the not so good stuff..... As mentioned before there is an airport check in desk. Good idea, yes, bad set up though. I had arranged the night before check out for a bellman to be at our room at 11:20 am. At 11:15 am I get a call saying they are running late and to proceed to the lobby for the airport check in and our luggage would be brought to us. Ok, no problem. Wrong. The line was all the way to the gift shop. I waited for over an hour. I was just two people away from checking in before my luggage got to me. If they hadn't have made it with the bags before then I would have had to start all over again becasue they won't allow you to check in without your luggage. There was only one computer meaning just one person checking all these people in. One person to attached luggage tags and one person loading luggage on a cart for storage or delivery. It was so bad that people were missing their buses to the airport because of the delays. I have used the airport check in at other resorts and never, ever had this problem. So be forewarned to allow yourself plenty of time or if you can have one member of your party stand in line for everyone. I hate to leave on a bad remark so lets not...

We used the Magical Express without any problems and check in was fairly easy except when we got to the Magic Kingdom they had not put a number on my sons card so we had to go to guest services to get a temporary card until we got back to the resort. The grounds at this resort are beautiful, it made the resort feel more private and relaxing with all the greenery around you. We used the main pool once and it was quite busy and being in building 17 it was quite a walk to the main pool so we just spent time at the quiet pool beside our building. We used the laundry facilities once and the dryers do not dry very well but the laundry area was clean. The boat ride to Downtown Disney is relaxing and quite nice we took the boat twice and really enjoyed it. The food court was nice to use if you were around the resort in the morning or early evening but as the night wore on the food area got really busy after everyone returned from the parks, we purchased the refillable mugs and these were wonderful we would fill it up on our way to a park in the morning and we would have a drink at the park and then when we returned we would stop to fill up before returning to our room and therefore would have fruit punch or lemonade if needed in the morning in the room before breakfast. The buses were for the most part okay, there were times at the end of the night that of course they would be busy when the whole entire park is leaving because the park was closing but they do their best and most of the time they had two buses at a time waiting. they always had lines of buses waiting one night at MGM we saw a guy directing a line up of empty buses to the resort pick up areas so everything seemed to move pretty good.The one complaint would be that they had a bus for Blizzard Beach and the Animal Kingdom to share i do not know if it is always like this but by the time we got to Blizzard Beach after picking up at Animal Kingdom the bus would already be pretty full. All in all though we do not have any complaints about the buses. The rooms were really quite nice, the trundle bed worked out well and my eight year old slept on it every night. the room is not huge but was okay for two adults and three kids we would basically just sleep there and were gone for the other times to the parks and water parks. Our fridge was great it actually froze anything put in there so we had frozen water to start off the day and it stayed cold longer at the parks. As mentioned before we were in building 17 which we thought was quite a walk to the buses and the main building i would try for a closer building next time but it was nice being beside a quiet pool which was not too quiet it seems that everyone needed a swim after returning from the parks which is understandable in the heat but not very many tried to keep quiet at midnight they would actually be loud and such.Overall we loved this resort and we are glad that Disney has a moderately priced resort for families of five and we wish they had more resorts like this so we could experience more of the Disney resorts and themes, but for now we are happy to return to the Riverside resort and hope to do so soon.", "Date": "October 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mississippi", "Title": "\u201cshuttle system not what it used to be\u201d", "Author": "lauridale", "ReviewID": "UR5880961", "Content": "We stayed at this resort from Sept 20-25. We had a nice time but there were some kinks in this trip. The first kink we experienced was using the magic express service with an 8:20p.m. arrival time. Nobody suggested to us that this was a mistake but we soon figured this out. The shuttle to the hotel was excellent with no wait time. However, the bags take 2-3 hours to arrive. This would have worked fine if it had been a daytime arrival but with little tired children this was a disaster. We had no clothes, no toothbrushes, toothpaste(thanks to new airline restrictions), or pajamas. To top it off we were given a room that had dead batteries in the doorlock so we were locked out of our room for over an hour while my husband stayed with crying children and I walked back and forth through the maze of buildings in the dark for each of three different sets of keys, none of which worked. They finally sent a repair man to the room who fixed it very quickly but it was now midnight. We shut the door and 5 minutes later after we had tucked the kids to bed in their clothes the bags arrived. Riverside did give us our first night free because of all the trouble, which I greatly appreciated. The shuttle system was VERY slow. It would take up to 40 minutes at times during the day to get a shuttle to the park, and we went during an off peak time. At the park we would watch bus after bus roll up and have to stop to load disabled scooter bound folks on the bus. This took approximately 20 minutes per scooter and on one day I watched as four scooters piled up in a line waiting for a bus. This caused huge delays. Disney shuttle service has never been this slow and I believe it is due to the increase in the use of these motorized scooters. I hope they will tweak their system to accomodate more disabled people travelling to their parks. Right now it is a disaster for all. If I came again I would stay at a park directly serviced by monorails or I would rent a car. The shuttle service at the end of a busy funfilled day sucks the magic right out of it. I also would not recommend using the Disney express if you have a flight time after 4pm with little children with early bedtimes. We also chose the dining program which is very nice but you have to book all your dinners well in advance because you will find nothing available anywhere when you get there.

I was a bit apprehensive after reading some earlier posts which described the hotel as dirty and complaints of hearing toilets flushing through the walls. I found all of this to be untrue. We stayed in Alligator Bayou Building 15 which was excellent. While I did not put a microscope to the carpets, it appeared to be very clean (much cleaner than the Comfort Suites I stayed in the previous week) and I only heard a neighboring room's toilet flush once and the sound was faint at best. The room itself was outstanding, had a fridge, trundle bed, and a safe. It even had a nice curtain that separated the vanity area from the rest of the room which my wife really appreciated. If you do decide to stay in the Alligator Bayou section of Riverside I recommend building 14 or 15 in that order to be close to food court, main pool, and bus transportation. Also, be sure to request a first floor room. We stayed on the second floor and found the stairs to be awkwardly located away from the paths leading to the buildings which made for a lot of extra walking. Transportation was one of the few complaints I had with this resort. The buildings are sprawled out with multiple bus stops at the resort making for longer bus rides. This is the same way with all the moderates (stayed at Carribean Beach four years ago). Sometimes the bus would also stop at Port Orleans French Quarter but most of the time the resorts had separate buses. We seemed to encounter long waits for the Riverside bus when returning from the Magic Kingdom. One night after the fireworks we had to wait for three buses just to board while French Quarter guests experienced little wait. This was not fun with exhausted little ones. The pools were nice, the food court was decent, and all the staff was extremely friendly. A housekeeper actually let me borrow a disney bike to go to the lobby to get change. And if you stay here you gotta see \"Piano Bob\" in the Riverside lounge. This guy is like nothing you've ever seen. He sings on a moving piano and gets everyone in the action. Make sure you bring the kids cause they're sure to have a great time. We got the Disney dining plan for free when we booked but let me tell you I would gladly pay for it if I ever stayed at Disney again. We racked up over $200 a day in food and ate at some of the best restaurants Disney has to offer. I probably gained 10 pounds. We did have a problem one night getting back to our resort. We booked at California Grill atop of the Contemporary which was awesome, however, we had a difficult time getting back to Riverside after our meal. After the parks close the only bus routes are to Downtown Disney. We had to find a bus to Downtown Disney and then take the boat ride back to Riverside. This took over 2 hours!!!. Keep in mind that no buses run directly from one resort to another and some of Disney's best restaurants are in the deluxe resorts. This always results in 2 bus rides or a bus ride and a monorail ride to another resort. I really did enjoy my stay at Riverside. It's an excellent choice among the moderates and I liked the theme a little bit better than Carribean Beach. As far as I know the Alligator Bayou section at Riverside are the only rooms in the moderate class that offer a trundle bed (it's free!!!) so if you got 5 in your family like I do it's a no brainer. I think if I stayed there again I would probably suck it up and rent a car. If money is not an factor than I suggest staying at the Poly, the Contemporary, or the Grand Floridian because they're on the monorail line which makes for quick travel to the Magic Kingdom (Epcot by switching monorails at the TTC).

It is a neat resort but not a luxury hotel. The magical express counter is a little difficult to find (besides the car rental). I could not see a direction sign in the airport. Otherwise, the magical express is very convenient with a few stops. I arrived at early afternoon; there were not a lot of people queuing at the registration. There was TV cartoon for my son to enjoy while waiting. We went to the theme park in the afternoon and the luggage already in the room when we returned at night. The buses to the theme parks departed every 10 to 15 minutes and rarely full. If I stayed until the parks closed, I might wait for 3 buses or 30 minutes because I had small children who could not stand all the way. I observed that the queue for the value resorts were significantly longer. I had called the resort for reserving a convenient quiet room before departure. My room was at block 15 ground floor which is close to everything, bus stop, swimming pool and restaurants. The resort spreads out quiet a bit of area. If you are far from the main building, it will take quite a while to figure out all the winding paths. The room is not splendid but clean. The room cleaner made towel arts of a fish, doll and a heart, pretty nice. Is it because of the tips I am not sure. There is an additional bed you can slide out from one of the double bed. It is very nice that each one of us slept on a separate bed. The air condition had some compressor noise since individual machine at each room as in most resort. The refill mug is worthwhile only if you plan to eat often in the resort. The restaurant and food court are rarely full. But we prefer to eat inside the theme parks which save time and more varieties. There is pretty nice food within Epcot. I joined the meal plan and they were all covered. There are some activities within the resort, even the main swimming pool, in my opinion, is not big. Because my main goal is to visit the theme parks, so it does not concern me too much. I believe because of the low season, we got very good service at low low price.

And what a awesome change..The off sites were HOJO's, the first of which was totally disgusting(Enchanted), the second was as hotels/motels go, but way better than the first. But I digress. POR was great. From the time we checked in, till the day we checked out. The staff was very helpful with answering questions a first timer had and housekeeping was great. We didn't get any special towel animals or anything, but we always came back from the parks to a very clean room and made beds. Now being a mother of four, when someone else makes your bed, you're just soooo happy!!! The kids collected the little soaps and shampoos, and they were replaced the next day. The pool was eh, a pool to relax at. The kids enjoyed it. As for the food court, well, it wasn't four star dining, but it worked just fine. We ate there twice, once for breakfast and once for dinner. For us it was a bit pricey, but it was Disney. We walked around the premises(when we weren't too tired), took the boat to Downtown Disney, and just took it all in. The bus system worked out greaaaattt!! Since we drove our own car, it saved alot on gas for us. But the wait wasn't long and I think the longest we waited for a bus was coming back from an Extra Magic Hour night which was only about 10 mins. Being a slightly big family, we would let others get on the bus and just wait for the next one. It wasn't a big deal, while waiting the kids would just talk about the parks and rides. My son(3 now), was more excited about riding the bus than anything else(well except for Pluto).

Simply because I had to leave my room and go out on the public corridor/porch to see the water, which was one of the quiet pools. Also I wish they had more kind size beds. What kind of hotel these days have mostly double rooms anyway???? Don't pay more for a waterview room. We rode on the bus with another couple who did not pay for a waterview room, but got one when they checked in. Why would you pay for something you can get for free???

However, our stay was quite pleasant. My wife and I, along with our 4 year old grandson, traveled to Disney World from Sep 1 to Sep 4, 2006. We spent three nights in POR. The young man at the front desk was very pleasant and spent quite a bit of time with us when we checked in to help us select a good room. His advice was spot on, as we ended up in the Magnolia Terrace building, in a ground floor room just steps from the quiet pool there, the laundry room (which we used and it was a nice facility), just around the corner from the ice machine and very close to the bus stop for Disney Transportation. The room was clean and in excellent condition, no stains, no mold, no damaged furniture. Housekeeping was great - the room was always done up when we returned, with fresh soap and shampoo and great towel animals to entertain our grandson. The maid paid so much attention to detail that she even noticed that we did not use the decaf coffee and from that point on she left only regular coffee. She of course earned herself a very nice tip. Our room had two double beds, a fridge in a cabinet (which worked very well and kept things very cold), a table with two chairs, and of course a TV in a cabinet. The bathroom was pretty typical hotel style but did have two sinks which was a nice feature. The only thing we found odd was the room had no closet but just an open rod along one wall of the sink area of the bath room. However, I understand this is typical of all the moderate and less resorts at WDW. The room also had a safe built into the wall. We only ate one time at the resort, using the food court and taking our food back to the bar to listen to the piano player (he was great and our grandson really got a kick out of him). We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food from the food court and the prices, while high, were not outlandish. We also ordered pizza from the resort one night and it was good as well but not great. The pizza was large and the package included a two liter bottle of soft drink with the whole thing costing $25 .... again too much but not outlandish. The Disney Transportation (bus only from POR to the parks, boats to Downtown Disney) worked well and was timely. We never waited more than 10 minutes for a bus. We also used the Magical Express from the airport and that is a really good service. We rented a car the last two days so we did not use the Express back to the airport. We thought the main pool with the water slide was well done and the lifeguards were good. It of course was much busier and noisier than the pool closer to our room, but more fun for the kids. The noise from the pool could not be heard from our room at all. Over all, we were quite happy with POR. We are not among the Disney \"regulars\", having been there once before about 4 or 5 years ago (just the two of us), and will not be returning again until our youngest grandchild is old enough to go.

We were in Disney Orlando for one week, 8-13-06 to 8-20-06. We were told this was off peak since most of the schools in Florida were returning that week. This was not true at all. It must have been the last week before school resumed because every park was over crowded and the lines on an average were an hour and a half to two hours to wait. Despite the crowds and lines we were excited to be staying on the Disney property. We chose the Disney, Port Orleans Riverside resort. We've actually stayed with the POR 3 years ago and it was a nice resort. In the past we have traveled with eight or more family members with varying budgets so we decided to stay at one of Disney's Moderate resorts to keep the cost affordable without feeling budget and three years ago this worked. Unfortunately, Disney seems to have lost the \"Magic\" at this \"Moderate\" resort. I am not one to complain unless it is warranted and this actually is my first written hotel review, but, my experience at Disney's Port Orleans was one of my worst experiences and I definitely left feeling like I overpaid! I paid Disney Resort prices for less than Motel 6 quality. Here were some of my observations: 1. The staff from the front desk, concierge and in every restaurant were inattentive, out of touch and a lot of times rude! 2. The rooms were unkempt, with dirty stained carpets, spots and scratches on the walls and the bathrooms were disgusting my rooms had mildewed shower curtains and brown drip stains behind the toilet. 3. Housekeeping, though very nice, never cleaned the tub and in one incident didn't show up to clean the rooms until 5:30pm. 4. The grounds for the most part were well maintained, however, the smells that one could encounter ranged from manure fertilizer to duck droppings and for the first time I encountered a dead snake lying between the pathway and the bushes. 5. The restaurants had mediocre offerings and the hosts a Boatrights had no clue about reservations or customer service the server at our table actually dropped salsa down my sister's back and on her white pants and the only thing offered was a cloth napkin with a dash of seltzer water to wipe at the stain. Not even an apology was given. Long story short, if this is indicative of the quality and customer service one receives from the Disney Moderate hotel than the Moderate hotel is not for me. The next time will be Deluxe accommodations even if some of us have to save all year to pay for it. This Disney experience was one of my worst experiences and we frequently visit Disney at least once a year. Although our accommodations were at Disney's Port Orleans Riverside we dined at their various Deluxe resorts and at one glance of the grounds and their customer service and attention to detail, it was clear that anyone staying in anything less was being treated like a second class citizen and that is unfortunate since Disney advertises their \"Magic\" for all pockets and price ranges.

Activities - lots to do such as take a horse carriage ride, rent many different types of bikes, rent pontoon boat, small sea razer boat, kayak. Pools - were really nice although crowded. After all, it was 96 degrees out and humid as could be! There was also a smaller quieter pool located near our building 35. Transportation - this was good and bad. Good because it's available and free and ran about every 20 minutes. Bad because we spent 2 hours/day waiting for buses and traveling. Each trip is usually 5-15 minutes wait, then 10-20 minutes to get there, then the same to get back. If you only go to one place/day that's an hour. But usually we'd go at least 2 places a day, say once to Disney World and then maybe to Downtown Disney at nite. So that's 2 hours day taken up! You could hardly plan on getting to three places/day because there's not enough time. Each park is soooo huge, you're walking a lot within the park and that itself is time-consuming. If I went again, which I probably won't any time in the near future, I'd check into a hotel with more transportation options so you could get places quicker. TIP - take the free boat ride down the river to French Quarter and Downtown disney, even if you don't get off! Especially at nite, it's really pretty, quiet, and a charming ride! rooms - nice decor, fair sized, came with free frig. service - very friendly staff, easy check-in, but a bit of a wait. Magical Express service is nice because they take of your bags to and from airport, but again, a wait in line for service because there's only one attendant for the airline check-in. food - not bad at all and for decent prices. Four of us could get a meal for about $30 breakfast, $40 dinner. But if you stayed there a while, you'd get sick of the same thing every day because choices are limited. I'd say 3 days and you'd want to move on to somewhere else. But the convenience was nice. We didn't eat at the Boathouse. We figured it might be the same food as the food court but maybe with more choices. I can't say for sure. But there were always long lines anyways any my kids didn't have the patience to wait. Bad - (aside from transportation stated above) cleanliness of rooms - not good! We didn't unpack and put our stuff away in the drawers because each one was dirty with hairs and other dust/dirt. There was a big hole in the bathroom wall behind where the doorknob had hit. You could also tell they didn't clean behind furniture, under beds, etc. Port Orleans is a really nice place overall and we enjoyed our stay at the resort. Disney World is a whole different story because it's packed behind belief in August and hotter than you can imagine. Two days I got heat stroke and had to recuperate back at the hotel. The lines were unbearably long everywhere you go and fast passes are limited. If you didn't get one by 11am or so for the most popular rides, you could be out of luck. We went to Animal Kingdom 3x to try and get on the newest ride and never got a chance. You'd have to be there when it first opens and we like to sleep in on vacation. Also, even though they have extra magical hours (open early and late once in a while for Disney resort guests), it's still a madhouse because EVERYONE tries to take advantage and it's just a mad rush to get in and there's still THOUSANDS of people who are guests. We got up at 6:30 am (!!) one morning to take advantage of 8AM early hours at Epcot. Had breakfast and got to the bus at 7:30. well, so did everyone else! Lucky for us, we were at the front of the line and able to get on the first bus. For those unfortunate people who didn't get on the first bus, they probably didn't get there until at least 8:15 - 8:30 and there goes your EXTRA magical hour! When we got to Epcot, there was a THRONG of people already waiting at the gate for it to open. By the time we got to the Fastpass line, another 10-15 minute walk through the park, Fastpass tickets were being given out for 9:45 AM. So we waited in line for half an hour for another ride (because you can only have one Fastpass at a time). Then we had to wait until about 9:45 for another Fast pass, got that, went on the first Fastpass ride, and had to wait another two hours for the third Fastpass ride. Get it? Needless to say, I would NEVER go to DIsney world again in August - terrible weather and long, long lines. But the resort - very nice.

Only request was to have adjoining rooms with sister-in-law and niece which was met. I wish now we would have requested a building closer to the lobby. We stayed in alligator bayou building 34, Very long walk to the lobby, food court, and gift shop. My family arrived late on the 19th. Was roughly a 20 minute wait to register, then we ran to the food court to eat before they closed. Bought the re-fillable mugs, very good deal. $11.99 and drink at the resort for free afterward. The only negative is they don't hold a lot. Since I've been home I filled it with ice and took a measuring cup and only was able to fit less than 1 cup of water in the mug. So buy the mug , but take a \"real mug\" with you. During dinner I had to go re-fill my mug three times. Food court was hit and miss. My wife loved the philly cheese steak sandwich. The nachos and taco salad were very good to greasy depending on who made it. The burgers were what I expected! The fridge in the room never seemed to get cold. We called to ask for help with this , but nothing ever came from the call. There are no knobs or instructions in the fridge we had. It did keep bottle water and milk we bought at the food court cool enough for us. The resort has paddle boats, kayaks, and multi person bikes to rent. We took the boat to DTD one night and it was a nice little ride, highly recommend this. The bus transpotation to the parks was very decent. Only one very long wait, otherwise 10-15 minute wait. The one bad thing about the buses while I was there was that it seemed as if everyone was at POR. When you leave the park at night you go to a bus station and every night it seemed that the POR bus station was the busiest. Always a large crowd, after getting stuck a couple times standing on a crowded bus holding a stroller we decided to wait for the next bus near the end of our stay. My wife , who held our 3y/o, was always able to get a seat, but the other four of us had to stand a lot. So let other people pass you if they want to stand on the bus, it's not that long of a wait for the next one and it a much better ride sitting down holding a stroller, kids, packages and such. The room always looked clean, the grounds were very nice, and workers very friendly. Some towels looked as if they needed to be replaced, but otherwise everything was very nice. I didn't spend much time at the pool except for the last day waiting to leave. Got to the main pool a little after 12 noon and it was full. Or actually what I mean was there were no loungers left.

Ran every few min. NO WAIT!! The room keys were your tickets to the parks since we added tickets to our stay as well as charging while on the resort grounds. No money needed kept card on file up front. We had a great stay.

Food court there and I suggest Boatwright's breakfast-wonderful(order the mickey pancakes for the kids--to cute.Had to take my daughter to ER our first day staff helped us find very easily. After that things were good. Never made it to Epcot this visit but all other parks were great. My children had never been to Disney they enjoyed so much.I've been before but this was my first visit to Animal Kingdom. Get the battery water bottles with fans(HOT,HOT,HOT)in JULY OF COURSE. All in all we had a great time, my daughter had the best time and her face lit up when she was able to pose with the princesses. Disney has this thing called PHOTO PASS, they scan this card with every picture you take with characters. You then bring it home and can pull it up and purchase if you choose to do so. I hope that we will be able to return in a few years when the children are a little older but we will definately stay at the Port Orleans Resort again. I enjoyed my stay there very much. Word of advice CHECK IN EARLY or you may stand in a line that has about 100 people in it. Luckily I was not one of those people our room was ready about 11:00 am when we arrived.

I am a very objective person and I always call it like it is. When I got to our room, the first thing I did was look around to inspect the cleanliness. Except for a little dab of what looked like toothpaste in a crevice of the tile floor near the sinks, it was SPOTLESS! In fact, the room was more attractive than any picture I've seen of it online or anywhere else. Everything was in top shape and the theming here is fantastic. It has a very, very homey, rustic feel to it, without sacrificing any creature comforts or amenities like coffemakers, refrigerator, or room safe (fyi--the room safe is located on the other side of the wall where the sinks are, just behind the privacy curtain. It took me 3 days to discover this!). Yes, this is a big resort, so there will be a lot of walking, but I don't mind that. Besides, we all could use a little more exercise in this country, can't we? Bus wait? Never, ever, even at the busiest times, was more than 20 minutes. Usually about 5-10. Where some of these people are coming up with these ridiculously long wait times is beyond me. I just know we never waited more than 20. Landscaping? We stayed in the Alligator Bayou section so the theme here was the swampy bayous of the deep south. Beautiful, serene, tropical, lush, full of life. Look for the tiny lizards, they're all over and really add to the feel of the bayou. The main building is very classy, really has an old south feel to it. Elegant and welcoming at the same time. Food Court is hit or miss. Sometimes it was good other times, not too good. Try to get there when it's not too busy. You'll get better service and it will feel more relaxing, as it is one of the most attractive food courts I've seen. For a really great breakfast, head to there table-service restaurant Boatwright's. I got the sweet potatoe pancakes as others had suggested and let me say that they were heaven to the palate. They taste incredible! Don't pass them up when you go; you won't be sorry. Only got to swim in the pool briefly one night, but from what I could tell it's a huge pool with pretty decent themeing, but it could have been done better. Pool was well heated, much to my delight. Overall service was quick and everyone I encountered was pleasant. Registration was just about the quickest I've ever experienced in a hotel, anywhere! Very impressive.

Our room was a reasonable size for the four of us, it was clean, the beds were quite comfortable (although the sheets could have fitted better) and there were always plenty of fresh clean towels. Pool towels are also available at the main pool (which was always really busy). The restaurant was excellent but also very busy (so make reservations) and a little expensive. The food court was really good value for money - pasta, pizza, burgers,chicken and, our particular favorite, the Philly cheese steak sandwich. Buy the refillable mugs in the foodcourt for $12 and you're sure to get your moneys worth (try the hot chocolate!) We heard a lot about the Disney Dining Plan which seemed to be a good idea but we enjoyed the flexibility of being able to eat out on International Drive (would recommend Ponderosa, Denny's and Olive Gardens). We did not use the bus service because we had a hire car and the hotel was so close to all the parks (usually a 10 - 15 minute drive) and also as a Disney hotel guest you get free parking. We also found it more convenient to use the car park at the back of our building. We did take the boat from the hotel to Downtown Disney which we all enjoyed.

I've stayed at many hotels from a Motel 6 to 5 star resorts. I do research on the places I stay at and usually know what to expect. I'm not a complainer by nature but expect to get what I pay for. In this case, I did not get what I paid for by any means. First the Good: * Food court has one of the best cheeseburgers I've every had. It just took a long time to get it. *Hotel has nice themeing. Disney pays attention to detail and I definitely had that \"old\" south feeling. *Most of the Service people (Maids, groundskeepers, luggage folks, ladies in the store) were kind and friendly and helpful. *The Boat to Downtown Disney is a nice ride and much more relaxing that the bus. *Bob Jackson (the Piano Guy) is a hoot and definitely worth a trip over to this hotel to see him if your not staying here. *The pool is nice, but getting a bit rundown and looks like it needs some sprucing up. But my kid enjoyed going there in the evenings. The Bad: *Everything that Disney's touts as being a perk to staying onsite is non-existant. Bus service from this hotel is horrible. Either Drive and use your own car or rent one. Riverside shares buses with French Quarter and there is always a significant wait for the bus anytime you want to go anywhere. Give yourself at least 1 hr to get anywhere by bus. Expect to stand too, because buses are packed like sardines in a can. *The Food court is confusing and overcrowded. It took me 30 minutes from the time I ordered until I paid for my food. *The rooms where dirty and shabby looking. They do wash the blankets on the beds but not the bedspreads, so throw the bedspread off and call for an extra blanket. They only change sheets every three days, so if they are dirty you have to call housekeeping. The bathroom floors where dirty ( I wiped the floor and it came up black!) and I found dust bunnies everywhere in the room. When I dropped the remote control behind the side table and pulled it out to retrieve it, I found an old band-aid and some popcorn that had obviously been there awhile. *The worst experience was walking (A very lonnnnnggggg walk) back to my room one night, I nearly stepped on a kingsnake which looked like a coral snake in color. I nearly had a heartattack. I know that there are critters everywhere (we are on a swamp) but snakes scare me. *Found peoples socks hanging in the trees, used towels laying in the bushes, broken glass in the corridors and the trash cans where always full of empty pizza boxes. *The first concierage we encountered was very friendly and helpful. The second time we sought help from the concierage, she was surly, distracted and obviously overworked and underpaid. *Management at this hotel was also less than stellar. We had a bug issue in our room that was not handle in the best way. We were not impressed at all with their rudeness and lack of utter disregard for our situation. I came close to moving to another resort at this point, but everything was booked up. *If it's raining outside and your stuck in your room watching tv, good luck trying to find anything. Their tv stations suck. Heck they got one called \"Your next Disney Vacation\". Just another way to suck you into spending more money. Conclusion: For the amount of money one pays to stay at a Disney resort, you can do better. Next time I go to Disney, I planning on staying off-property. Mainly when you stay at one of their resort, they got you. You spend all your money here, which is fine with them. You are nickel and dimed to death there. Everything costs something. Don't even bother making a collect call, because that costs money too. When you stay off property, you have more freedom to eat where you want, go where you want and get better accdomadations for a much better price. I was sadly dissapointed in my stay here and will not return to ANY Disney property in the future.

I would rate this hotel above average. The reviews are true, the resort is huge!!! The layout is very confusing and you can easily get lost looking for the smaller pools so be careful. At checkin I was quite tired and didn't confirm our room. Instead of lodge 18, as I had requested at when I booked the room, we were sent way over to lodge 38. I still remember the clerk making a comment that this lodge was quite close to everything. Overall I can handle the extra walking but on our first day there I fell and split open one knee and twisted my ankle quite badly so being so far from everything made the experience less than positive. This is where Disney could really stand some improvement. I've broken both ankels at lease once each, I'm not clumsey just quite active, so I knew that it was a bad sprain not a break. Disney did not provide any help. A very nice couple from Missouri helped me out, my husband and daughter were back at the main pool and I couldn't get ahold of them. A number of disney cast members zipped by my in their little carts with no offer to stop and help. The next day as I hobbled out of the hotel not one of them mentioned their free wheel chairs. It wasn't until the end of a very long day limping around Epcot that someone mentioned that the resorts have free wheel chairs. What a difference that made. The next day my husband wheeled me and my daughter all over the Magic Kingdom. We were given access to the wheel chair lines which meant no waiting. Overall we enjoyed POR. Our daughter fell in love with the beautiful horses that pull the carriages around the resort. The meal plan is definately worth it. It simplifies things and if you book your meals a day in advance you'll likely get what you want. We're going back next year but will try the Carribean Beach Resort. My husband now has a policy of not letting me go for a walk without our communicators. Another good idea. The communicators certainly made everything quite a bit easier. If my husband wanted to go off and ride the Rockin' Roller Coaster he could. My daughter and I were able to wander through the shops and we were able to easily meet up.

I was speechless from the moment we entered the grounds. Yes, things are very spread out, but who wants to stay in a cookie cutter hotel at Disney. The walk around the trails wasn't nearly as bad as some people say. I had read reviews about people getting lost on all of the trails. The only \"lost\" people I encountered had just left the River Roost and were extremely inebriated. I would not suggest trying to find your way when your drunk. The room was as expected from seeing pictures. I can't complain about them, because all we did in the room was sleep. The only time I heard toilets flushing was when I was in the bathroom, never when I was trying to sleep. We had no problem getting a bus to any park, and the most we waited was 10 minutes. However, getting from the parks back to our resort was a little more difficult. Our first day we went to EPCOT and when we got to the bus stop to go back to the resort, the line was very long. This is to be expected at most parks because POR and FQ together is the biggest resort in Disney. The only thing to say is maybe Disney should double up on buses returning to POR at the end of the night. All in all, I can't complain about anything. Every person I encountered was helpful and nice. My oldest daughter celebrated her birthday while we were there and the cast members at the parks went out of their way to say happy birthday to her.

The room was sufficient for the 5 of us (children aged 10, 7 and 5) but we were feeling a little cramped by the end of the fortnight. The fridge was invaluable, and I even used the iron this time - just the once though! There were vending machines (crisps, cans, chocolate) and ice machines all over the place, so I guess you'll never be too far from one. The only thing which we found inconvenient was the food court - like many others, there were several queues for different types of food, and the service was not particularly quick, which, with 3 children all wanting different meals, meant that food was often cold by the time we reached the table. Also, portions from the evening menu were not especially big, although the breakfasts were very generous. The food was varied and tasty, though, and all freshly prepared. Fridges carry fresh fruit bowls, crudites and dips, yogurts etc. We liked the shop at the hotel, which had the usual range of Disney souvenirs, but also carried basic medical supplies such as pain relief and plasters, basic baby care products, milk, beer, cigarettes, soft drinks, bakery items, basic toiletries etc - useful if you've forgotten something and don't want to venture off-site. We used 2 of the pools, the main one with slide and waterfall, and one near the room which was just a pool - both were good fun, clean and safe. There were free pool towels and we borrowed a flotation jacket for our youngest for the duration, free of charge. We also used the pool over at Port Prleans French Quarter, which was lovely - the toilets there have ample changing facilities.

Upon returning later that day to pick up our belongings from the storage room, instead of helping us get our luggage to our rooms (which were at the very end of the resort #25 Alligator Bayou) they basically just piled our luggage, etc on the sidewalk and told us to do for ourselves. I was under the impression we were still \" ON VACATION \" and they were there to help make our stay as pleasurable as possible. We asked for carts to help accommidate uswith this task, but were refused and told we were not DISNEY CLUB members and could not use them. I even spoke to one of your employees and told him I would return this cart when we were unloaded and still was refused the use of it. This is not a very professional way to treat paying guest. We might have been a large group of people, but we were still paying guest. With around 100 of us staying there for 3 days ( a fairly hefty sum of money had already been paid to your resort) I feel that the small request for help being made, should have been the least that your staff could have done for us. I can guarantee you that I will let all my future Disney visitors know that your resort would not be my first choice, since it is apparent that your resort really doesn't care about helping their patrons.

I stayed there with my husband and 2 children aged 8 and 5 for 10 nights from 15th-25th May and we absolutely loved it. Our check-in procedure was smooth and I received all the requests I had asked for (a room in Magnolia Terrace; ground floor; and a waterview - which fair enough, we had paid for ). We were astounded by the beauty of the 'mansions' - a lovely river, lots of greenery and just a wonderful calm atmosphere (which is just what we wanted after a mad full-on day at the Disney parks). We were situated just steps away from a 'quiet pool' (each building has it's own quiet pool plus there is the Ole Man Rivers themed pool - which in my opinion is certainly far from boring as the previous reviewer says - it has a waterslide, and water spraying out from 'overflowing' logs). Oh, and the Muddy Rivers pool bar - you must try the Mud Slide cocktail mmmmmmm! The food court (think it was called the Riverside Mill) was great - there was huge choice at breakfast and we ate there for dinner a few evenings too, each time our food was really tasty. We also ate in Boatwrights - the table service restaurant, which was also nice. The Disney bus service we found to be excellent. We never waited longer than 5 minutes for a bus; both going to the parks and coming back to the hotel. I think the reviewer must have stayed at a different hotel to us! Our room was ample big enough for the 4 of us - 2 double beds with room to move around them. Double sinks outside of the bathroom, and a bath with power shower and obviously a toilet. Room was always cleaned well, and Mousekeeping always did fun things with our kid's newly purchased soft toys! We hired a boat one day from the marina which was good fun. We also took the free boat to Downtown Disney one evening. My husband and son also hired a 4-seater bike (you know the thing - with a roof?!), which they had good fun on.

My only beef with this hotel was the cleanliness of the rooms. My mom and I went and we found the room to look a little old and dusty. The lighting wasn't terribly great either, specifically in the bathroom, where I needed to apply my makeup in the morning. The decor of the room was charming enough, It was to reflect the bygone era of Antebellum mansions along the Mississippi River. The resort itself was fantastic, The busing system, though most people seem to have trials with, wasn't a problem for us. Our section,(I believe it was Magnolia Bend) was near the bus stop, so we had a five minute walk to the buses, and waited maybe at the longest fifteen minutes for one. Which in my estimation, is not a big deal. I have to compliment the breakfast I had at the Restaurant, Sassagoula? I can't remember the name now. It was very delicious, though not as good as the breakfast I had at Grand Floridian's 1900 Park Faire, or the Breakfast at Crystal Palace in Magic Kingdom. However, the eggs were delcious, and the puffed cinnamon french toast to die for. The food court was fine, except my beef was with ignorant people butting in front of me as there is no obvious start of line in there. My mom especially enjoyed the refillable coffee mug deal since she's a big coffee drinker. The Ice cream was great too. Another compliment to this resort was the gift shoppe staff. There was an adorable older man in there that swapped pins with me and was really charming and funny. I also loved the fact that you could take a little shuttle boat to Pleasure Island and have dinner and shop etc. We also really loved that you could feed the ducks and Ibyss' at the hotel, they'd come right up to you and take peanuts out of your hand! Last, but certainly not least, the scenery and the pool. The scenery, is typical Florida. A swampy pond attatching itself to Lake Buena Vista, man-made I expect, which is supposed to emulate the Mississipi, lots of cypress trees, pretty gardens and bridges. Disney definitely does the scenery and gardens beautifully. The Pool was great, I even got id' at the pool bar, which made me feel fabulous since Im well over 21. The pool was fun if not a little overcrowed with kids, but hey its Disney. It had a little water slide resembling a little rocky ledge thing, and a rope to swing off of type of deal, and water falls. It was supposed to be like a Bayou or something. You also had access to the Port Orleans French Quarter pool if you wanted, but I never went there. All in all it was a great time, but for the amount of time you spned in your hotel its almost worth it to stay at a Value resort.

I thought I would post a review since I was really interested in feedback and agonized over the resort choice before going... First, let me just say that POR was AMAZING - I doubt I will ever take a chance and stay anywhere else again. It exceeded every expectation I had -and I found that a lot of the negative info. I read on here before we went did not hold true for us. I also want to say that none of the pictures that are posted anywhere for this site do it justice - it is so much more beautiful in person - I was blown away. We also considered the POFQ site - but was really glad we didn't once we got there. It just didn't look as nice as POR. Having seen it, we would not stay there. I just want to say that we drove through Old Key West, Saratoga Springs, POFQ, and Carribbean Beach, and none of them looked as nice as POR. We put in a request for a Magnolia Bend room but were placed in building 28 in Alligator Bayou - though I was disappointed at check in, I am so glad now that I was in the Alligator Bayou section. The room was so clean and neat and everything in it (furniture, linens etc.) looked brand new. Even though it was a bit of a walk to things - the grounds were so beautiful that we didn't care. Also, the West Bus Depot was just a short walk from our room. We never waited more than 3 minutes (honestly) for a bus, either from or to our resort. We had heard that the bus was always full at POR - but that was not true - we were always the first on if we got on at West Depot. Also, people complained of how loud the building was, saying they could hear toilets flushing in adjacent rooms, etc. We wouldn't have even known there were other people around - the rooms were so quiet. The Magnolia buidings are so big and more like a hotel style and we heard others complaining about the noise there. The Alligator Bayou rooms are so secluded and quiet. I highly recommend them. People also complained about the Riverside Mill for food - we are really picky and thought it was great. We thought the food selection was pretty diverse and everything we tried was good. We ate a breakfast and lunch there. We did not eat at Boatwrights. The pool at Ol' Man Island was amazing and never too crowded - you did have to be a little pushy to get into the hot tub though as it was always pretty full. The layout of the main buildings is so beautiful, especially at night. We particularly enjoyed the boat ride to Downtown Disney. The staff were really helpful, even going on to our airline website to check in for us so we would get good seat choices. The housekeeping staff also made fun characters out of our towels, facecloths etc. Also, we used the Disney Magical Express and had a very good wexperience with that, though we did bring our bags with us.

One thing that I really did not like was the way the grounds were spread out. You had to walk forever to get to your room.

Port Orleans Riverside was not our favorite. The rooms were not the cleanest, but I do understand that it is hard to clean so many rooms in a day. We were at Disney during Grad week, and some of the kids stayed at this resort. They were not bad, just being kids- running and doing cannon balls in the quiet pool, talking loudly on the buses. Also the property was not landscaped with what we have come to expect at Disney. When we first arrived the grass was long, there were brown spots on the lawn, flower beds looked like they need raking. If I could choose again I would stay at the Polynesian or Caribbean, and not go during grad week. I guess when I'm paying so much money for a family vacation, I don't want to see teenagers running around without their guardians. When kids have adults with them, they are usually much better behaved, like you would expect in a family resort. The overall property of the resort was pretty with the river and mansions. The food court was not as cheerful as the Caribbean's. We took the boat to Downtown Disney which was really fun!! Contrary to other reports I did not see an alligator, and when I asked the captains of the boat they both told me that the river did not have alligators.... I lost a bet to my husband, because I told him there were.:) We stayed in the magnolia bend section, right across from the quiet pool.

I think this is the ideal location-- very close to the lobby, but not so close you have tons of foot-traffic sounds. Also, it's not next to a parking lot (I don't know if those get noisy or not). We were on the second floor, which was fine. We have two smallish kids (5 and 3) so it was wonderful getting to use the trundle bed, although we hadn't officially requested it. I believe they have available portable bed rails if you are concerned about kids falling out of the somewhat high beds. Our room, 1840, was very clean and in good repair, although I did think my dh's side of the bed seemed like it was lower at the head than the foot. We all slept great the whole time, which isn't even usual for us-- the beds must be pretty decent. I had never really given much thought to the \"theme\" of the Deep South, but I can tell you I appreciated it after our 7 night stay. Riverside is so beautiful and relaxing and fun. We went for some runs around the resort, and a surrey bike ride. We went for a few trips on the boat to Downtown Disney (sometimes we only went as far as the French Quarter). The Riverside pool was not as fun-looking, and not as heated, as the FQ one, but that was fine b/c it was so easy and enjoyable to get from one resort to the other. Both my kids loved the FQ slide, and I saw kids as young as 2 enjoying it. The main pools at each resort not only have plenty of their bright white, absorbent towels, but also snug-latching swim vests for the kids who don't know how to swim. We liked the food court, esp the Mickey waffles in the morning. I walked to the FQ one morning for the beignettes (sorry spelling is mangled)-- freshly made fried dough covered with an inch of powdered sugar. When we ate dinner at Riverside's food court, we usually stuck to the spaghetti with meatballs. The kid's plate of spaghetti will come with a free meatball if you request it. Fruit costs $1 per piece, and the tiny yoplait yogurts are $2 each. One of those basically single-serving bottles of oj is $2.99 at the food court, but only $2.39 down the hall at the general store. Items are not well marked as to price at either the food court or the general store. The Riverside hot chocolate (just down from the coffee) is really yummy. Plenty of white towels in the room. I tipped the maid $3 to $5 per day (depending on if I had any ones). We did not get any towel animals, so I was glad I hadn't mentioned them to my kids. The maid would leave the tv on a kids' station, and after a while I figured out it was to make it look like the collection she made of our stuffed animals, were watching. Plenty of hot water. I only noticed noise from another room one night (they must have been checking in to it around 10 pm before I was asleep). It's true that you will hear the sound of toilets flushing in other rooms, but this was not loud enough to be obnoxious or irritating-- more something I noticed b/c I had read so many references to it. We had only about 2 mosquito bites (and they LOVE me, and we had spent a few dusk trips on the boat to downtown Disney). One of the best things I did with this vacation, was stick around the resort each afternoon and some evenings to enjoy the place. I really had a fantastic stay and would recommend this resort highly. I can't imagine not choosing to stay here again the next time (I hope there's a next time!) we go.

We arrived at 1:45 pm and were told that we would have to wait until 4 pm to check in to our room. We had requested the Mansions side and wanted to stay on that side. Suddenly after several minutes of conversation about what to do while we waited to get into our room, suddenly a room was ready. We took the room in Oak Manor. It was a nice walk over a bridge from the main lobby to get to our building. We loved the Mansions side with large stately buildings with wrought iron railings with large steps up to each floor. They had beautiful couryards that faced the river outside each mansion building. Our room overlooked the courtyard with a nice grassy area and a large water fountain. Our children were greeted almost daily by little bunnies in the courtyard. They looked forward to getting up in the morning to see if the bunnies were outside. They have nice walkways that go all around the resort. You see horse drawn carriages and family bicycles on the pathways daily. There are several bridges that cross over the river. They have a nice playground and family pool with a water slide on the center island of the resort. This can be quite a walk depending on what area you are staying in! They also have smaller pools between some of the other buildings that are convenient to get to. We only used the family pool one time. The main lobby area has a nice gift shop, arcade, bar, sit down restaurant and food court. Behind the lobby area is a dock area that leads down to the boat access area. You can rent boats or use the resort ferry to get to dowtown disney. We used the ferry one night to get to downtown disney and back. They pick up at POR first and then go to French Quarter. We ate at Boatwrights for dinner one night. It was a very good meal! We used the food court for dinner one night, pizza one night and breakfast our last morning. The kids loved the mickey waffles. The resort had pretty much everything we needed to be comfortable for a weeks stay. We spent very little time at the resort itself but most of our days/nights were at the parks. The outside of the resort was beautiful and nicely spread out. The rooms were pretty average to other hotel standards. There were two double beds, small table with two chairs, armoire with tv inside and some drawers. A bench for luggage and some wall hooks above it. There was one night stand between the two beds and a refrigerator by the armoire.. Each bed had a lamp on the wall above them. There was a ceiling fan and a ceiling light. The room had one large window with blinds and curtains. The bathroom was very small with just a toilet and shower/bath combo with two towel rods. They left fresh towels each day and soap and shampoo. The maids would fold the kids blankets and put their stuffed animals on top of them on the bed. They folded the towels differentely through the week and sometimes made the the towels look like animals. The room had a small dressing area that had a curtain that you could close off for some privacy. There were two pedastal sinks and a large counter for toiletries. The room had a hairdryer on the wall. There was a shelf and rod for extra clothes, luggage, etc. There was a coffee pot with some cups and coffee on teh shelf. I guess you would have to find a place on the small table to use it daily. We never used it. The room has a very small safe area to lock up small valuables and cash! The beds were pretty comfy but the beds needed two pillows per person. The pillows were not comfortable at all! The walls are thin. We could hear our neighbors talking, taking showers, flushing the toilet, etc. You could also easily hear people walking by your rooms at night. It took me a few nights to learn to sleep with the noise. This was irritating to me. The bus system also was frustrating. The closest bus area to our room was the last stop and we never got a seat and ended up staning to and from the parks. We switched and started to walk over the main bus pickup by the main lobby but it was not much better. They pick up from French Quarter first and then come to POR so you get what seats are left over. We rarely had a seat on the bus to the parks. It was pretty much the same way back from the parks. The lines were always long for the port orleans buses and we stood most of the time! That was annoying by the end of the week...We enjoyed our stay and wished we could have spend some more time checking out the resort, using the pools, playground, etc. but we just spent every waking moment in one of the disney parks.

It was easy to find and it was a great treat to see \"team members\" greeting us with Mickey hands! The wait for the bus was around 10 to 15 minutes - but once on the bus we were off for our magical trip and we were able to watch a video to pass the time. Our check in was fabulous! We had to wait a few minutes - but hey its THE Walt Disney World - people coming to visit should expect a short wait for just about anything - but not necessarily everything! We were able to check in and buy our tickets - and also make dinner reservations all at the same place! It was also and extra treat to see town from around our area adorning the ceiling in the main lobby. (Cape Girardeau, Ste. Genevieve, etc.) The only thing I should mention about the Disney Magical Express is to expect your luggage to come later. We arrived late at night - so we received our luggage at about 1 or 2 am (by our choice). We stayed at Magnolia Bend on the outside - closer to the parking lot. It was about a 5 minute walk from our room to the main building and a 2 minute walk from our room to the closest bus stop. Our room was fabulous. We did have two full size beds - which were perfect for us .. the room had just been updated and I loved the newer bathrooms and tile! I took pictures of the room to take home as an inspiration for some remodeling! We had a \"private\" (more adults only) pool just a few feet from our room that was fabulous. And the smell of the Magnolia trees was absolutley wonderful! (Can you tell we had a great time!) The food at Riverside was good - it would be what you expect. Yes - it is a little bit pricey - but you should expect that at a resort. We were able to split some meals and save some money that way. We are planning on going back again and we will definetly participate in the Disney Dining Plan next time! It sounds so wonderful! I would like to save the best for last: The Disney transportation system and the extended magical hours. The transportation system saved us soooo much money! We did not have to rent a car, we did not have to pay for airport transfers and we could go where ever we wanted to on a Disney property. One afternoon - we were able to go and visit the other Disney resort property and make a \"next time\" list. That list comprised off all of the resorts we want to stay at for \"next time\"! And last but not least - the extended magical hours! The first day - my mom and I were really excited so we got up extra early and we attended the \"opening show\" for the Magical Kingdom. Once the show was over - the doors opened and we went on 5 rides in 1 hour (before the park opened up to the regular guest). We went on Pirates of the Caribean (twice), Thunder Mountain, Splash Mountain and the Haunted Mansion!! There were little to no lines for the rides in the morning extended hours but more of a wait for the evening extended hours. If you can go ... go! Just make sure to keep a positive attitude and know that the team members are doing their best!

POR rooms do not have a balcony to sit and enjoy the river, so your view of the river can only be seen from your hotel window. Am I missing something? What's the point of charging extra?

The staff was very friendly. I had no major complaints, although I have to agree with other reviewers the flushing of the toilets is very loud. We used both pool areas, my 6 year old son preferred the French Quarter slide. The rest of us liked the Riverside pools better, the quiet pool next to our building was very pleasant.

Our room was consistently clean, every day. comfortable beds just enough room. (not overly spacious...but enough space to rest and even eat there if you wanted. The refridgerator was a plus.

So he slept late many mornings.....and you never were bothered by noise from the many kids there, or by cleaning ladies. A very solid place.

One thing is that the food court IS badly laid out, in my estimation...you have to go too many places to assess what you want...but it was fine for basic breakfasts and a quick lunch. I did notice that many of Disneys restaurants have limited menus...small in each place, but sufficient. It might be good to check out the menus before hand....do they list the menu's on line? We Loved the Bahama Breeze restaurant just outside the main gates by the way....wonderful atmosphere and food....great deal on food compared to other places.

We did enjoy our week and it's still our 2nd favourite Disney resort after Wilderness Lodge, but we didn't have a very good start to our stay. When we booked the only room request we made was for Alligator Bayou. However, when we checked in we were told no AB rooms were available and we were allocated a room in Magnolia Terrace (8762). As we approached the room, which was very close to a stairwell, we could hear a loud noise. This turned out to be from a large metal fan-looking object in the garden immediately below the walkway in front of the room. Once inside the room, with the door shut, this noise was still loud, constant and intrusive. I phoned the front desk and asked if we could move to another room as this noise was unacceptable. The Cast Member (CM) insisted the hotel was fully booked and no other room was available. I was very polite but said that I whilst I understood they may be full that night, I could not believe everyone else had already checked in. I pointed out that we were staying for a full week and wanted to spend some time relaxing in our room so the noise really did make a difference to us. Perhaps to someone only staying for a night or two, or not planning to spend much time in the room, this noise wouldn't be such a problem. She said she had checked with the room manager and the only option was a room just a few doors down, which would most likely have the same problem. When I pressed further she said we could probably move to another room the next day, but she could not guarantee where it would be, not even the approximate vicinity. We would have to leave our bags at Bell Services in the morning then later on check in again, and only then would we know where the room was \u2013 and we could end up no better off. When I asked if we could have an AB room if we waited until the following day, she very sharply said that those rooms are for families of 5 only. I pointed out that we had stayed in an AB room on previous occasions, only ever the 2 of us, but she insisted that they are only for groups of 5. I agreed that we would move the following day, and she said \"they\" would call me in the morning (no idea of time) to tell me what I needed to do. After a long day and a transatlantic flight, I really did not need this disappointment and aggravation. And I certainly did not expect it from Disney. I sat for a few minutes but then decided I really couldn't settle, so I went back to the front desk in person. There I explained the situation, said how disappointed we were, and asked if there was any chance of a different room. Kimberley looked on the computer and said she was unable to release another room but that she would check with someone else. She went over and spoke to a man further down the desk, then came back and said she had another room for us. She gave me the keys, explaining that once we'd used them to access the new room then the keys for the old room would be disabled. (She was so kind I could have hugged her \u2013 bless you Kimberley!) We went to see where the new room (9212, in Oak Manor) was situated and found it was in a nice quiet area, overlooking gardens. So we collected our bags from 8762 and left there gladly, although with some sympathy for whoever ended up in that room later. It seems a shame that when a hotel is so beautifully themed, some rooms are blighted by equipment noise like this \u2013 surely there must be a way of designing the building so this is avoided? It was disappointing to be allocated such a room in a Disney hotel, but more disappointing to be treated as I was by the CM on the phone. She insisted time and again that there was nothing she or her manager could do, yet Kimberley was able to help very quickly. The landscaping and theming at POR are lovely, and we enjoyed just walking around the grounds, admiring the views and watching the wildlife \u2013 particularly the rabbits on the lawns in the evenings. The boat ride to Downtown Disney is pleasant and relaxing. Our nearest bus stop was the East Depot, the last pick-up point at POR, which meant we generally didn't get a seat. This wasn't a problem for us really, although we were surprised how often children stayed seated when adults \u2013 particularly older adults \u2013 were standing. The food court leaves much to be desired. The food is reasonable given that it's mass catering, but the organisation is terrible. Having to wait in line separately for each type of food is crazy and means families either don't eat together or some end up with their food going cold by the time everyone has their meal. It's always been like this, even in Dixie days, but there must be a better way \u2013 perhaps by placing orders for all food, like in Roaring Forks at Wilderness Lodge. I think going away from pizza slices to individually prepared pizzas was a backward step; the line used to move much quicker because the pizza was there ready to be served. We enjoyed breakfast and dinner in Boatwrights; breakfast in particular was excellent, although the menu choice isn't as extensive as it once was. No steak and eggs, and no pastries of any sort, not even beignets \u2013 which seems strange when the bakery is right next door. But the scrambled eggs were to die for. I have to agree with previous opinions that the cleanliness of rooms leaves something to be desired. Nothing major, but it seemed as if the room hadn't been cleaned thoroughly for quite some time. The daily housekeeping seemed to be fairly superficial \u2013 make the beds, change the towels, and quickly wipe down the bath, toilet and sinks. The area behind the taps on the sinks wasn't clean when we arrived and wasn't touched during our stay. Similarly the bathroom floor behind the toilet \u2013 in fact, the floors of both the bathroom and sink area did not appear to have been properly cleaned for a long time and were looking pretty grubby. This was very different from our previous stays, and we can only think that fewer housekeepers are now having to work on a greater number of rooms and simply don't have the time to clean properly. That said, most days we came back to find towel animals waiting for us! All in all \u2013 after a rough start \u2013 we had a relaxing and enjoyable stay, and it is still our favourite 'moderate' Disney resort.", "Date": "March 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Apex, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGood place to stay.\u201d", "Author": "Macfamily", "ReviewID": "UR4627341", "Content": "Stayed here from March 5th to 11th with 2 adjoining rooms and 4 small children under 8.

The trip to Disney was great. The Port Orleans -Riverside, however, had little to do with the trip's greatness. The grounds of the resort are nice.

A thick coating of dust on the coat rack, and obvious mildew/mold in the shower. The pier fishing was a joke - cest pool (we just looked, did not fish) Perhaps the chartered fishing trip they offer would have been nice, but its really expensive. The price for 2 hours was more than a full day guided trip at any other fishing destination. Let's face it - you're going to Disney to see Mickey and the gang, not hang out at a hotel. What made the trip a success for us was the fabulous weather (80 degress and not a cloud in the sky), the relatively light crowds on weekdays in February, and watching our 4 year old son go completely bonkers. The big selling point for a WDW resort is the extended park hours. Unless your kids are older than ours (4), then they likely won't have the stamina to use the extended hours. You're probably better off staying at a nicer/cleaner hotel in Orlando and taking a shuttle to the Parks.

The staff didn\u2019t have the \"Have a magical day\" feel like the staff at riverside did. Transportation was also a concern for us because the only way to the theme parks was by bus. I was pleasantly surprised to find our longest wait to go anywhere was 8 mins. The busses are dispatched according to need. If a bus fills and passengers are left behind the driver will radio for backup which arrives shortly after. The busses can get crowded at peak times (I.E.) opening/closing but everything is crowded in the park. We would just leave a bit later and return a bit earlier to avoid the sardine feeling. Riverside sprawling property was home to plenty of pools and recreational things to do. A fishing hole which is perfect to take small children to teach fishing. There are boat rentals of all sizes and I could go on, but why stay at your resort? Theme parks await! Maybe I crazy but I don\u2019t want to hang out at my room. I want to taste the food around the world showcase in Epcot, or ride the new rollercoaster \"Everest\" (which is very cool) in Animal Kingdom.

I recently took my family of six (2 adults, 2 children and 2 infants) for our annual pilgrimage to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. This year we stayed at Disney\u2019s Port Orleans Riverside from 7-17 January 2006. We booked our ten night stay in the middle of November 2005. We have been to Walt Disney World four times in the past two years because the kids just love it. The first time we stayed in Disney\u2019s Caribbean Beach Resort and the second and third times we stayed at Disney\u2019s Pop Century Resort. Although we have thoroughly enjoyed our previous stays at these other resorts, this year we had to book into Disney\u2019s Port Orleans Riverside because this is the only resort that could reasonably accommodate our family of six. Disney\u2019s Port Orleans Riverside is one of a small number of resorts that offer trundle beds for an additional child allowing 2 adults and up to three or four children to stay in the same room. We booked our Disney guestroom directly with the Walt Disney Travel Company. Before booking, I studied other reports of this resort posted on the TripAdvisor website. We really appreciate the useful comments of Lisa Jane, another TripAdvisor member who had recently stayed at Disney\u2019s Port Orleans Riverside. Resort Facilities: Disney\u2019s Port Orleans Riverside used to be called Dixie Landings. Disney\u2019s Port Orleans Riverside and Disney\u2019s Port Orleans French Quarter technically function as a single but vast resort. Disney\u2019s Port Orleans Riverside is more or less in the centre of Walt Disney World and is 10-15 minutes by Disney bus to all the major theme parks. Disney\u2019s Port Orleans Riverside is quite reminiscent of the rural South. The resort is divided into two parts: the Alligator Bayou and the Magnolia Bend. These areas consist of \u201cparishes\u201d. Closest to the \u201ccity\u201d the guestrooms are in Mansion homes; farther upriver the guestrooms are in less luxurious rustic buildings. However, the rooms are all decorated to a similar standard. Only Disney\u2019s Port Orleans French Quarter has more luxuriously decorated guestrooms. The resort has many facilities including seven swimming pools and a playground. There is plenty to do here; biking, boating, fishing and horse-drawn carriage rides. The proximity to Downtown Disney is a great bonus. There is a river shuttle that takes guests up river to Downtown Disney via Disney\u2019s Port Orleans French Quarter and Disney\u2019s Old Key West. As with all other Disney resorts regular buses take you wherever you care to go in Walt Disney World. During busy periods people tend to jump the lines at the bus stops! Rooms: Our room was a standard garden view room (340 square feet) with two queen size beds. We requested and got a room with a child's trundle bed and a refrigerator. The trundle bed and refrigerator were included in the price we paid. Only Disney value resorts (Pop Century and All Star resorts) charge for a refrigerator. You definitely need a refrigerator if you are travelling with two children and two infants! I had already read the reports of other TripAdvisor members regarding the best buildings in this resort. My preferences were building 18 or, as an alternative, building 14 - as these are closest to the guest-services building, Fulton\u2019s General store, Boatright\u2019s Dining Hall and Riverside Mill, the food court. Luckily, we were given a room in Alligator Bayou block 14 which was great for us as this building is only a 3 minute walk from all the resort facilities. Our room was on the first floor and featured a color TV, telephone, Disney\u2019s voicemail system, data port/internet access, coffee maker, safe, two sinks and a hairdryer. I have to admit that our room was not particularly luxurious. I can also confirm that our building appeared to be older and not so well maintained. However, the location of building 14 is ideal. If you want a more attractive building ask for a room in either of the H shaped buildings. Buildings 15, 16, 17 and 24 are best avoided due to traffic noise from Bonnet Creek Parkway. Disney's Magical Express: This limited offer is a complimentary service for Walt Disney World\u00ae Resort hotel Guests only. It features complimentary shuttle and luggage delivery direct from Orlando International Airport to Walt Disney World Resorts. It includes delivery of your luggage direct to your hotel guestroom -and back to the airport again! The service is complimentary and includes round-trip motor coach transportation and baggage handling between the airport and Disney World. Use this service before Disney withdraws it at the end of 2006 when the \u201cHappiest Celebration On Earth\u201d comes to an end! Dining: We did not try Boatright\u2019s Dining Hall but had dinner at the Riverside Mill on most evenings. The food was great but the variety was not great. I recall there was more variety at the Caribbean Beach and Pop Century resorts. However, Riverside Mill was huge with lots of tables. We always managed to get seats even when the food court was heaving with resort guests. The take away pizzas were OK \u2013 not the best I have had. The Disney cast members in the Riverside Mill and Fulton\u2019s General store were very friendly, helpful and polite. Our Experience Overall: As with all other Disney resorts staying onsite is fantastic \u2013 staying with Mickey is a real bonus and I would not stay outside Walt Disney World especially since I don\u2019t like to hire a car and drive in unfamiliar roads while I\u2019m on vacation. I must admit that the so-called heated swimming pools at the hotel were freezing in January and only suitable for polar bears! However, the pools were very clean and the kids loved the slides. Our room was clean and comfortable. We had no major problems until a noisy family moved into one of the guestrooms next to us. This is when we noticed how thin the walls were! A quick call to concierge remedied the situation! My family love Walt Disney World and on this trip Disney\u2019s Port Orleans Riverside was the only resort which could accommodate all of us. Nevertheless I was impressed with this resort. We were very happy here and eagerly look forward to staying here again in the near future.", "Date": "February 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAs expected.........\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4405631", "Content": "I stayed at this resort from 12th January to 20th January and, having stayed at a number of Disney hotels over the years (last one 5 years ago), you know what to generally expect.

The food court in a morning was manic, but it always is and a good tip for UK tourists is that Americans get up early so try to get to the food court at about 8:30am to avoid the rush. Also, picking the location of your room is important as some locations are quite a walk. Ask for Oak Manor as it's two minutes from all the important things on-site. To me the real treat for this resort is the boat ride to Downtown Disney......a very pleasant experience on a warm night. As to the Disney Parks, I think Disney is cost cutting. The fireworks at Epcot don't last as long as they used to and the 3:00pm parade at Magic Kingdom isn't as big. The new ride Sorin' is very good.

They also offered horse drawn carriage rides, boat rentals, bike rentals, fishing gear rentals, you name it!!! We did encounter a few problems though.

I would also recommend the dining plan - gave us great options for restaurants and meals (our reciepts were usually $140+) for 4 people. Our favorite was Biergarten at Epcot.

The children enjoyed the active swimming area of Ol' Man Island. The rooms were spacious, clean and attractive. Each of our three rooms had a requested fridge which proved to be beneficial for breakfast. The grade for the food court varied amongst our party. Some of us ate several meals there. The party with children ate there only once because of a less than favourable experience with the kids' meals. A good selection of restaurants is available at Downtown Disney which is a short and relaxing boat trip away.

The curtain separating the double sinks from the sleeping area gave an extra place to change that came in handy with everyone getting ready for dinner. Port Orleans is the only mod resort with a trundle bed and it will accomodate 5 people.

The rooms are also equipped with a refridgerator, an iron, ironing board and in room safe. I was in Alligator Alley building 37 and it seemed far out but was still an easy walk to the main pool and lobby, restaurant etc. I never heard a noise outside in the evening, though. The grounds are beautiful, clean, expansive and really make you feel like you are living the Southern good life. ( Coming from Charleston, I felt right at home) The pools were great and you could also use the dragon pool at the French Quarter. We didn't though as the main pool at riverside had a hot tub, a large nice pool with a slide and plenty of chairs. The restaurants were good and the cafeteria style area was great at feeding everyone quickly and letting everyone chose what they wanted to eat. The Port Orleans are served by the Disney bus system, which I swear get slower and slower ( or I'm getting older and older) but another very nice option was the ferry into Downtown Disney. We did that in the evening and it was very pretty. Boat and bike rentals and horse and buggy rides rounded out the stay. Would I stay again? Definately!

We stayed in the Oak Manor portion of the resort. Our room was very clean and the bed and pillows comfortable. We made good use of the two different sinks/vanity areas and the divider between the beds and bathroom. The shower and bath was consistantly hot and the pressure was good. The refrigerator was a plus to store extra water and drinks. We ate at Boatwright's and the food was very tasty. My husband ordered the prime rib which he thought was done perfectly. The service was fast and friendly. We only grabbed a quick snack at the food court, but thought there were plenty of choices for all tastes. We did stop into the River Roost bar for a drink. The bartender was full of advice along with making good drinks. We felt that the prices for drinks were a bit high but the atmosphere made up for it. The prices at Boatwright's were normal for what were are used to paying at home for a similar meal. We checked out the game room....which was huge. If you had someone in your party who enjoys that kind of thing I'm sure they would have fun. Our room was close to one of the quite pools and the river. We didn't go to the pool, but it looked nice and clean. We did rent a SeaRacer (two seater boat) for a spin around. The boats don't go super fast but it was relaxing to cruise up and down the river.

ASK for AAA rate I pd $107 per night. they will not give you this info you must ask. We prefer this resort due to the boat transporation to the downtown disney area. During the Fall- parks close much earlier.. it's just nice to have another \"boat\" option rather then heading to the bus stop again. This was our first \"real\" family vac. We choose to return here also for the fact that it is so open, beautiful, and we knew the girls-who are 4 and 2 1/2 would enjoy playing ball in the grassy courtyards, like stroller rides along the S.river and watching the horses go by. To our surprise they have added refrig, coffee makers and the best of all curtain divider between the sinks and sleeping area. OK to all the moms who need to iron clothes and plan the next day while her family is sleeping..this was a God send. Food it is expense it does not change wherever you eat. You are going to disney..you budget money and then add some to that. ;) be safe a family of four. 2 adults 2 kids ave $100 a day you may spend less and it is very possible to do. all the reviews are spot on. We stay in the mansion we did not get mag. terrace like I requested months in advance, but Oak manor was actually in my opinion closer to the one bridge to the main building. pool was right next to building and no more then 5 people every time. Our daughters are still asking us if we can go back to our big white house :) They were very comfortable there and this is where we will return in the future. We did use the magical express..there are 3 stops before riverside driver was quick in unloading bags/strollers. Pick up ahhh you will be the first of the 4 resorts so it may seem you are leaving for the airport way to early. With the stops it all pans out. MExp. buses where nice and comfortable. Would use again if free. Just because you are at disney does not mean you are trapped in disney call mears from a house phone and get picked up to go to seaworld.. Dine with shamu..its better then a character brkfast. MOUSEKEEPERS- we tipped $1 a day which is expected we found if we tipped more nothing extra magical happened. The stuffed animals where always place nicely on the kids pillows. Soaps where always replaced. come on! you know you will take them also. BONUS at check in I told the desk that our daughter was here as a part of her bday celebration. Upon arriving at the room one even there was a 5x7 autog and message card from cinderella. They havent fizzled out all of the freebie perks YET. SNACKS- you are able to receive mail! we mailed a box of snacks to the resort and they where happy to store it and even delivered it to our room, not expected a thing. We mailed everything from fish crackers-cheerios, pudding and pretzels. Pack a bowl and load up your bev in the fridge each day. We ate brkfast in our room many days. We sent daddy to pick up warm things in the morning while the girls got dressed. REFILL mugs. this was the 1st time we bought them.

WE HAVE 2 FOR SALE if you are interested. 2 for the price of 1 plus ship obo jodig76@zbzoom.net I have even seen people trying to sell previos yrs mugs on ebay. Its a nice keep sake but if it would help another family...we are willing to part with ours. TICKET and DINING desk- stop by early and get priorty seating for all your meal that you plan to sit down for.

WE DID LEARN a new fact. If you make a priorty seating time..you are not obligated to keep it. there is no penalty, no charge..they just give your time away to a walk in. But it is extremely unlikely that a group would forgo a dinner reservation. Just book all your meals and be safe. DO NOT WAIT until the day of. hmm our 2nd trip I was preg with our first child we did not go to the parks, rather we went resort hopping every day we have experienced them all in one way or another I would still to this day choose riverside over the Grand floridian , Cont and Polyn deluxes. theese resorts are easy access to the magic king. but have not more magical touch then the riverside.

While waiting to leave a staff member asked about our stay and asked how they could improve. He took our one suggestion and noted it. It was our experience in the past that when you checkout of the Hotel you were almost invisible, Disney does seem to be changing that and we were very pleased. One last tip, when shopping you can have the items shipped to your home from the Disney Stores on site. While it may sound expensive it's really not. In shipping you do not pay sales tax and the shipping cost is only slightly above the tax rate if you use the lower price option. We arrived home to find the first shipment waiting for us.

Also depending on how long of time you are staying at the resort. I figured you will have to get at least 5 or 6 refills to break even, which is difficult if you also have the dining plan as we did.

Navigating Walt Disney World is not for the faint-hearted on their first visit...it took us awhile to find the place. Once you've arrived, do yourself a favor and let the excellent Disney transportation folks handle the driving. The room layout was unspectacular, with a generic outside-corridor motel arrangement. Nevertheless, the room was beautifully decorated with many features including an in-room safe, iron with ironing board, coffee maker and a shower massage among others. There were two minor complaints: one corner of one of the beds had come loose and was sitting on top of the trundle bed underneath, and the television remote control didn't work. A call to the front desk elicited friendly responses, and a real nice guy that showed up almost immediately to fix the bed and supply us with a replacement remote. In the bathroom, many folks like the idea of two separate sinks, but I would have preferred a vanity counter. Small glass shelves above the sinks aren't really the best substitute. And the tap water tastes TERRIBLE! Your room has a complimentary refrigerator; use it to chill the bottled water you supply yourself. Although the service in the food court isn't bad, the food is forgettable. The sit-down restaurant is much better, although pretty expensive. If you can, try to grab the boat to downtown Disney for better food and better choices. The hotel's gift shop is interesting, and the prices aren't too bad considering the venue: Not cheap, but not ridiculously expensive, either. Go in with an open mind, and you'll not be surprised. Daylight brought uncomfortably warm temperatures for a guy from the Pacific Northwest. Still, it's Florida. Some things have to be anticipated. The pool close to our room wasn't bad, although a bit generic. I'm not much of a swimmer, so my reviews end there. My sister's kids reported the \"Dragon Pool\" at Port Orleans French Quarter is much better, and there are of course the water parks of Walt Disney World. My sister was in an adjoining room, and while trying to knock on the wall to get her attention, we discoverd these buildings are of masonry construction and built to last...the wall was concrete.

It was nice not to pick up the luggage, it just appeared in our room later in the day. We arrived in late morning and after a pleasant 30 minute bus ride (informaiton movie on board) we arrived at the hotel after a few drop offs which gave you a chance to see some of the other hotels. Our room was available immediatly, however, we just took a quick break and then on to the Magic Kingdom. The bus service from the hotel to all of the theme parks was quick and efficient. There is one ususally every 10 minutes so there is no waiting or long lines. Returning at the park closing is much busier, so what if you have to stand, most rides take only 10 minutes or so for the return to the hotel. Please note that if you wish to transfer to another resort, you have to go from your hotel to a theme park then get on a bus to that resort (plan extra time for that). The package plan including meals and Park Hopper Pass was wonderfull. Upon check-in they give you a swipe card with your name on it. It is your room key, park entrance ticket (you have to have place your hand in the gate wicket for finger print ID. each time you enter a theme park), and your meal ticket. Even for your snacks every restaurant, soda/popcorn stand in Disney takes the card. What an excellent system. We stayed in block 9200 which is just over the bridge from the main reception/restaurant area (about a 2 minute walk). There was a 24 hr. pool just outside the room which was never crowded or noisy. The food court was large with plenty of selection. Never felt crowded or had to line up for any period of time. Nice touch with the bakery, can still taste those cinnimon rolls right out of the oven. We had made reservations for evening dinner a month prior to leaving for the five full sitdown meal service credits. You are given a brochure on check- in which outlines which restaurant the 'meal plan' is approved for. The best dinners were at the other resorts especially O'Hannas at the Polynesian Resort. Ask for a table along the glass area and be seated prior to the Magic Kingdom fireworks show at 8:00, what a view. Boumas is also excellent at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. We also ate at the Liberty Square Tavern at the Magic Kingdom and at the Italy pavillion at Epcot. The Riverside Resort also has a good restaurant called Boatwrights, however, it pales in comparison to Boumas and O'Hannas. The meal package is very generous, however, a bit confusing at first. It you email me I would be more than happy to explain it to you. The front desk clerk at check-in did not do a good job with this and we had to stop in Guest Relations at one of the parks for a better explanation. The Riverside is a LARGE resort with 4 different bus platforms. For adults this resort has fever families with small children than the other moderate or budget resorts. I would not hesitate to stay there again, the grounds are beautifull and well kept. The rooms are very spacious and recently renovated. The Disney cast members are the company's best asset, all are friendly and greet you with a nice \"hello\". After talking to other people staying at the much more expensive luxury resorts, the Riverside compares favourably if not better in some aspects. Thanks Disney for making our vacation one of the best we have experienced for many years (this was our 9th trip to Disney world, the first time staying at a Disney Resort). Nice touch also with the \"extended hours\" at the theme parks for Disney Resort ONLY guests. Please feel free to email me at: dcardy2@cogeco.ca for any more details.

I arrived on the Magical Express Bus, which was very nice. BUT, they did only send one suitcase to the room, and we had to wait another 30mins for the second one to get there. Check-in was very easy. The Cast Members were very friendly and helpful. We stayed in the Oak Manor Section of the Mansions, room 9014. The grounds are very beautiful, but it's very spread out. At the end of the day after hours of walking and standing, the last thing I wanted to do was walk around the resort. Even though my section of the resort was near the main bldg, I was nearest the parking lot. So I never had the luxury of taking a quick trip to the store, or food court because it was a little too far after a long day. Most of the photos I saw made the rooms look a bit dark. They were not. I was there with one adult, which to me was enough for the room. There was only one bench to put a suitcase on, and the pedestal sinks in the bathrooms leave little room for personal items. I GREATLY appreciate the reviewer on this site who posted pics of what the room looks like AFTER you have unpacked. Those pics accurately showed how much space you're really dealing with. We only ate one meal at their sit-down restaurant Boatwrights. We ordered a house salad, garlic cheese bites, pot Roast, grilled pork loin, 2 sodas and 2 slices of pecan pie. The total was 60.31. The entrees were just okay. But the Pecan Pie was GREAT! We got a slice from the food court just about everyday we were there. We were glad that we were on the Disney Dinning plan. Our waitress Patricia gave us extra corn muffins and packed up our desserts to go. This was extremely helpful, because we ate these as snacks for the next few days. THANKS PATRICIA! We went back to thank Patricia but it was her day off. We enjoyed the food court. We ate both breakfast and dinner there. It was surprising how good and big the dinner portions were. And don't forget the pecan pie! For those of you who enjoy old arcade games, I'm pleased to tell you that they have MILLIPEDE!!!! (YES YES) They also have Ms. Pac Man, Space Invaders, Bowling, Centipede and Galaga. But unlike when I was a kid, the games cost 50cents. If I booked this hotel again, I would ask for a room that was closer to the main bldg. Those rooms appeared to be the ones in Oak Manor with a water view. I enjoyed my stay here, the rooms were big enough for 2 adults and comfortable.

Both my husband and I are in our late fifties. We have travelled many times to Disney World and stayed at Port Orleans Riverside three times. We arrived at Port Orleans Riverside on September 5, 2001 and for those 6 days at Disney World we had a wonderful time - just the two of us! We visited all the parks and spent a day at Typhoon Lagoon, and spent every night taking the boat from Riverside to Downtown Disney and Pleasure Island. The room was clean, the surroundings were romantic, calm and peaceful and the services offered to us were more than just acceptable. The only complaint we had was the food offered at the food court, but then again, we had wonderful choices once we entered Epcot and all the marvelous restaurants at World Showcase. However, I digress. On the morning of 9/11/2001, we were scheduled to fly home to Michigan. I called my daughter to remind her to pick us up at Detroit Metro airport and she told me to turn the tv on. Our whole world began to fall apart watching the horrendous events of that day. We knew we could not leave nor could we get home anytime soon since all flights were cancelled. There were hundreds of guests at this resort all concerned about loved ones at home and wanting to get home. I cannot say enough positive things about Disney Corporation and how they treated us at Port Orleans Riverside. While we were there, my husband and I made many long distance calls home to talk with our family and friends. All of these calls were \"backed out and off\" of our long distance calls and these calls were not charged to our room. We were reassured that as soon as Disney had any information about getting home we would be notified. On 9/11/2001 many families had arrived with their children to celebrate their vacations and good times and memories. Since Disney World was considered a prime terrorist target, all the parks were shut down immediately after the attacks. Disney World made sure that the children in the resorts had at least some form of entertainment and reassurance. They brought in Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Pluto, Chip and Dale and many other disney characters into the lobbies of their resorts in order that the children staying there would be entertained and reassured that everything was really OK! The young people who dressed up as Disney characters did this on their own time to make the children feel better. When we could not leave Florida, we were told by Disney \"You are our guests and therefore our families and you will not be charged for the rooms we stay in for the interim until we can get home.\" When the parks were opened on September 12, the guests were given free admission to all the parks and free lodging at the resorts until we could go home. What can I say? I felt protected and cared for during a horrible, horrible time when all my husband and I wanted to do was get home. All during 09/11 the guests of our resort gathered around the large tv screens in the main lobby area, watched the horrors and cried and hugged each other even though we were all strangers. We felt helpless and vulnerable and filled with grief that day. The staff at the front desk did everything they could to help us and reassure us and make us feel safe even though they wanted to be home with their loved ones that day. God forbid this ever happens to our country again, but if it does, Disney World is the place to be, other than home, where you will feel safe, protected and cared for. My husband and I have travelled extensively to Europe, Great Britain and taken many cruises. The week we spent at Disney World before 09/11/2001, will be remembered as one of the best vacations my husband and I ever had. We were in our late fifties and we felt like 10 year olds again visiting all the parks and in the evenings we felt like college students again enjoying the nightlife at Pleasure Island. We have been to Walt Disney World six times (twice with our children when they were young) and we are looking at a seventh trip this fall to make us feel young again. Disney World is a class act and well worth the money spent.

There was plenty of storage space, the closet area was large and the tub/toilet separate from the sink area was a plus. There was also a huge drape that could be closed around the closet/sink area for additional privacy. What a huge benefit that was!

The weather unfortuneately wasnt brilliant - 4-5 days of solid rain which is so unusual for florida at this time of year. However that wasnt Disney's fault or Port Orleans, and the whole place was just so beautiful and condusive to relaxation, we would certainly stay here again. We got to stay in both type of sections and we certainly preferred the mansion type areas for looks and location but thats purely a personal opinion. Others may prefer Alligator Bayou. The food court was probably the only 'average' part of Port Orleans: Riverside because it is exactly that - a food court, just like in a shopping mall - however there were plenty of eating options which I felt was adequate. Certainly better than the French Quarter which we tried out once and were shocked by how tiny it was and how much lack of choice there was. With the weather being so bad, we did find that the choice of television channels was quite limited compared to back home in England or many other places and htoels we have stayed in the USA but that shouldnt be an issue if its good weather or if you dont spend a minute in your room which most dont. The rooms we stayed in were clean on arrival and regularly cleaned throughout our stay, the pool areas were superb and had everything we needed. Another minor issue which for most will never happen as our trip was somewhat unique, was that Disney nearly lost our luggage. We were assured by Disney that as we were going travelling for a few days around the carolinas, to take in a NASCAR race in Charlotte, that we could leave some of our luggage we didnt need for those few days, with Disney for safekeeping. This was terrific as we didnt want to cart everything around with us knowing we were coming back to Disney for 9 days. The only proviso they gave us, when I checked this before booking, being that we returned to the same resort which was fine. Anyway on departure for our travelling, we handed in one suitcase and received the equivalent of a receipt slip - I made extra efforts to make sure the person understood we were returning in 6 days again to confirm. On our return they could not find the luggage for 20 mins or so only to find it behind the front desk, taped up and ready for fed ex delivery back to the United Kingdom later that evening as they thought we had returned home to the UK and had left it behind. Its minor and unlikely to happen to most but worth mentioning in case anyone has similar plans, so they might be wary.

We were supposed to fly in from Gulfport, MS. However, we had major airport delays the day after our wedding. Atlanta was snowed in and our flight was no longer available. The next flight out was booked so we had to drive 45 minutes to the Mobile, AL airport that afternoon in order to leave. So, we were hoping to arrive early in the day in order to have time to see some of the parks that day but we did not arrive until 7pm or so. We had arranged with Disney to have a car pick us up at the airport so that we would not have to wait for the Disney bus and wait for others to get off before our hotel. We were picked up by a white Lincoln which was a nice touch since we were on our honeymoon! The driver was very nice and the ride was completely no hassle. When we arrived, we went to the desk to check in. However, the girl at the desk informed us that there were no more King Beds available. This was NOT acceptable, we were on our honeymoon! Nothing like a fifties-style sleeping arrangement! We asked if we could at least be placed in a King room the next morning. She said yes but we would have to call down the next morning to check to be sure. Not at all comforting. I showed her my tickets and info I had received from Disney, with the note about requesting a king bed and she said she was sorry but there was nothing she could do. We were so tired and frustrated with the airport delays and king bed issue we just went to the room they gave us and ordered a pizza. We decided to try ONE more time and called down to the front desk and asked them to search and see if there were any king rooms available...amazingly, they said there were some available and we were moved right away. I think that the first girl at the front desk did not want to take the time to search for one since it was late. Well, that was the only problem we had the whole time and it was forgotten the next day since we had so much fun! The buses to and from the parks are great and the rooms were really nice. The only thing some people may not like is the amount of walking you have to do from the bus stops but there was one right behind our building. I live near New Orleans so this place was really no different from the southern atmosphere I'm used to. Now then, if anyone ever asks you when to go to Disney, weigh the options, and only tell the people you think should really know! If too many people find out, then it'll be too busy! But truly, if you ever want to know when the slowest time of the year is with gorgeous weather, look no further than the last week in January and first week in February. It is value season, it didn't rain any and the weather is short-sleeve or thin long-sleeve, Shorts or jeans, depends on your prefernce. It was almost dead in the parks. We like Epcot because of all of the different options for dinner but when we went during the day, it was almost like a ghost-town, which we loved. It was like having the park to yourself. We had such a blast and the trip was so fun. My husband and I are fun loving 20-somethings and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The Port Orleans breakfast buffet was nice as was the pizza delivery, and the resort grounds were well kept and quiet. It's a nice relaxing place away from the parks. If you have any room problems, just be persistent-it paid off for us. This resort is huge, they're bound to have what you're looking for or need.

We ate at the River Mill a few times, and the food is good- although somewhat pricey (although the prices were not out of line with food all around Disney). The best deal going is the cinnamon rolls-they are out of this world and reasonably priced. I would recommend stopping at a grocery store before getting to the resort and stocking up on lunchmeats, bread, etc, as that will save you a few bucks, and there are small refrigerators in the rooms (there was in ours anyway). I would recommend bringing some 2 liter bottles of soda also; even though there are free refills on the soda, hot chocolate, coffee, etc. if you buy the $11.99 length-of-stay refillable mug, it can be a long walk to the dining hall to fill up the mug.

This was our first stay at POR, second trip to Orlando. There are 2 sections at POR; Magnolia Bend and Alligator Bayou. We were in a nonsmoking room in the Magnolia Bend Section, about a 5-minute walk from the main building. The room had plenty of space for 2 adults and 1 child. The room was equipped with 2 double beds, a television, small round table with 2 chairs, and a small fridge. The bathroom was small with toilet and shower/tub but there was a nice area outside the bathroom with 2 sinks/mirrors and a curtain which could be pulled which made it easy for one person to be getting ready while another using the shower/toilet. The room was clean and housekeeping had always come before we had returned from the parks in the afternoon. There were many activities at POR including 1 main pool with a slide and many spraying fountains and a spa along with several satellite pools around Magnolia Bend and Alligator Bayou. We spent much of our time in the quiet pools which were spacious and less active, easier to keep an eye on a child. Among other activities were bike rentals, boat rentals, an arcade, and horse drawn carriage rides at an extra cost of course; and if you like to walk or jog, the grounds are beautiful with nice walkways and many trees and flowers. The bus transportation was very efficient to the parks. We never waited more than 10 minutes for a bus. There was also boat service to Downtown Disney that was very convenient for a meal or shopping. The Riverside Mill Food Court at POR was great with many selections to please everyone. It was a little pricey but comparable to other WDW eateries. There was also a restaurant, Boatright's Dining Hall, which we never ate at but always had many customers. Fulton's General Store was wonderful for souvenirs or snacks but also had baby items, non-prescription medications, film, and other convenience items.

We are a party of 5 (2 single moms (sisters) with 3 kids combined) and this hotel was spacious enough for us all. The mini fridge was a great bonus this time...however being on the Disney dining plan we didn't find much need to bring extra food or drinks with us to the parks. I would highly recommend the dining plan as well...it worked out great for us. The resort itself is spacious and beautiful but me who gets lost easily didn't find if hard to navigate at all. The pools are great and the food in the fast food area was great. The cashiers were quick and friendly. The one complaint would be the bus waiting area...they should have que lines like at the parks set up because on busy days people come from everywhere to board the bus so the first come first served doesn't apply there...it's whoever is most aggressive boards the bus first. But the buses seem pretty frequent so its not a major problem. I would put up with it for the convienience of not having to drive myself around there.

The character meals are fun for the kids but the food is not the greatest...we have been to many of them...my highlights being the Princess Breakfast in Norway at Epcot (best food), and both the character breakfast and dinners at 1900 Pare Fark in the Grand Floridian. However my kids would choose Chef Mickeys...they love the atmosphere. I would also recommend the dinner at O'Hana (no characters but it does have kids activities)...loved the food and the atmosphere...we had a great time.

Hints for the parks...make sure to bring rain jackets for each person...keep them in zip lock bags so they don't get anything else wet(bring box of zip lock bags, never know when you will need them!!), bring the hand held misting fans that work on batteries(bring extra batteries too), get strollers for the kids(even 9yr olds enjoy the ride), bring small icechest to fit plenty of water and snacks(worth it!!!)...you can put the ice chest on the stroller also, buy the stroller for the entire amount of days you are there...keep your name badge that goes on the stroller...reuse it for the next day...saves time and no need for the line, get the fast passes--saves time!

Here are some of the things I noticed. The landscaping and look of the entire Resort is gorgeous. It's like being in a park. Lots of trees, rivers, flowers, wildlife, bridges, etc. It surely must be the best landscaped resort at WDW, beating even the Deluxe Resorts! The room itself was very nice, primarily because all 2048 rooms were recently (2003-2005) refurbished. Everything in the room worked (all the lights) and the paintwork looked as good as new (because it was). The room had a small fridge, which was very useful for storing bottled drinks, sweets and chocolate snacks. There was also a coffee maker, ice bucket, electric hairdryer, and iron and ironing board. The basin area had a tiled floor and a privacy curtain, which divided the basins from the rest of the room. My one complaint about the room is the size of the beds. Most rooms have two double beds. If you're a couple, and enjoy sleeping together, then you might be a bit annoyed because the double beds are tight. There's not much space in them for two adults, so you're best off sleeping in separate beds! The Cotton Mill food court is very large, and offers a wide selection of food. There is tons of seating, but the best tables look out over the river and water wheel. My one complaint about the food court is the way you're forced to eat cereal. The cereal packs are tiny, so you'll have to buy two of them. The catch is, the food court has no bowls. So you have to eat the cereal out of the tiny packs, with a plastic spoon. It's just like being a baby again, and can get very annoying after 2 weeks! Outside the food court is the levee. This is a great place to hire a boat or surrey bike. The SeaRaycer boats are fun, but be warned; you might get soaked by the wave of a passing water taxi! Overall though, the Resort is great.

The greatest strength of the complex is its beautiful surroundings. The grounds are beautifully themed and are always spotlessly clean. It is very peaceful and very relaxing. It is definitely a step up in this respect from the All Star Resorts, though I would say that for families with children I wouldn't spend the money to upgrade to the moderate resort for their benefit because they will appreciate the styling of the All Stars far more than the beauty of Riverside. Another great strength is the staff, who are very friendly and helpful but unobtrusive. The Sassagoula Ferry to Downtown is another great reason to stay at the resort. The service is frequent and a lovely, hassle-free way of getting around. Entertainment on property is also very good in the bar: really rousing and fun. The only real downsides to this resort are its cost considering the amenities in the room and the very limited fare at the food court. If you can get a great deal from one of the cut-price websites or go off-season it would be great, but as someone booking a British package holiday and having to travel in school holidays the moderate resorts are expensive, especially when you basically get just a bedroom and bathroom. We discovered how restricting this can be this year when we all had bad colds while we were out there. Until you are stuck in the room you don't realise how claustrophobic you can feel as you have no balcony or outside space - you just end up closeted away in a dim room with the blinds closed (as you have people walking past your windows). This is why we have decided to stay elsewhere this Summer - for the same money (or even less!) you can get a room with a balcony and more amenities elsewhere and for us this has become a big issue, especially as the leap up to the next grade of Disney resort is comparatively expensive. Perhaps this will backfire on us as we won't have the advantage of the Disney service or attention to detail, but it does make you start to think about paying the premium for Disney Resorts. As for the food court, it's great for snacks, but the fare is limited to fries, pizzas, ribs, chicken etc with some sandwiches and salads. You really need to have a car and get off Disney to have the variety and advantage or more reasonable prices. Would I go again?

As a \u2018gift\u2019, at no charge, (for the next 18 months only) Disney World members greet you at the airport, (the Disney \"Magical Express\" greeters are everywhere in the airport waving at you\u2014it\u2019s so cute!) you go to the \u201c Disney Magical Express\u201d desk at the airport and confirm the information on your luggage etc. etc. (this takes only a couple of minutes) and they take your luggage to the resort for you (later delivered right to your room) and you board the clean air-conditioned bus to ride to your resort. Tip: This service is all new, so Disney is truly working to make it as smooth as possible\u2026they really do care\u2026.so please be patient with them as it\u2019s truly a kind gesture and a saving of over $100.00+ compared to taking a taxi or Mears etc.. (it\u2019s no charge for the next 18 months only----and at the end of your trip, on the way back when you return back to the airport, it\u2019s even more of a treat!, I\u2019ll tell you more about that at the end). Now, about Disney World\u2019s \u201cPort Orleans Riverside\u201d resort---we love, love, love, love, love, it here! The front desk area is beautiful (photo). Check-in was a breeze, and took just minutes (we arrived at about 6:00pm, no line-ups). With no luggage to carry, except our small carry-on luggage, it made is so easy to make our way to our pretty room. This resort is a vacation all by itself!! The beautiful landscaping is breath-taking, truly spectacular! There are beautiful Magnolia trees that border the river area, and whenever we visit in April/May they are in full bloom, with their lovely fragrance aroma in the air. And lovely flower gardens & urns along the pathways. Just the walk to-and-from your room will be a wonderful experience each day and night! The beautiful \u201cRiverside\u201d resort is a Disney concept of grand old South Mansions and bayou villages. We stayed in \"Magnolia Bend\", in the \u201cOak Manor\u201d section. (There are 4 mansion themed sections\u2014and also another section called \u201cAlligator Bayou\u201d) All the various themed sections in this resort are beautiful, some overlooking the peaceful river, others facing the various 6 of the beautiful swimming pool areas (more than one), others face into gorgeous courtyards with fountains and gardens; others nestled among beautiful grand tall trees, so peaceful. Because of the beauty of this resort, many lovely birds have made their \u2018home\u2019 here, you can hear them singing sweetly each day, and it really touches your heart. And adorable little brown bunny rabbits roam free all over the \u201cPort Orleans Riverside\u201d property, so charming. As mentioned we were situated in \"Magnolia Bend\"--the \u201cOak Manor\u201d, on the second floor, with a lovely view of the courtyard & fountain, and could see a little view of the river too. The room was lovely and clean, a good size too. (photo) Complimentary mini-fridge included. There are 2 pedestal sinks outside the inner locked bathroom, which contains the bathtub & toilet. (Don\u2019t worry about the 2 sinks being outside the main bathroom, as many of the rooms here have a curtain to shut, between the sink area and the bedroom, to avoid disturbing others in the room when washing your hands etc. It actually makes it easier to get ready to have the 2 sinks outside, saving much time, (photo). We love the Food Court! (Photo) After experiencing other resort foodcourts, we think the \u201cRiverside Mill\u201d food court is one of the best in Disney World! (A fancy cafeteria style restaurant) Not only is it a magnificent showpiece of a room (with the large Mill water wheel and gorgeous views of the river etc.)\u2014but the food choices are awesome! Here are some of the many choices: Pizza, Spaghetti & Meatballs, Alfredo Pasta, Chicken & Ribs, Hamburgers, hotdogs, fries (of course), Soup-of-the-day, Special-of-the-day (a hearty main meal), and wonderful Chicken Caesar Salads (great to share with a pizza!). A Wonderful bakery, with everything you can dream of: Cheesecake, Pecan Pie, cakes & cookies, various breads. What we enjoy is the refrigerated coolers, filled with so many healthy choices: Magnificent chef salads, (generous size, with ham, cheese, boiled eggs, etc.) Cottage Cheese containers, Peaches, fruit grapes & cheese platters, fruit cups, yogurt parfaits with granola etc. etc. (the list is endless) And a wonderful fresh fruit wagon, changed everyday, with lovely bananas, apples, oranges etc. For breakfast, we loved the steamy hot oatmeal, served with a little container of raisins and brown sugar-----it was heaven. Plus they have beautiful bacon/sausage eggs breakfasts with all the trimmings for both adults & children, French toast, pancakes etc. Besides the food court, there is also a lovely full-service restaurant. It has lovely choices too, and beautiful breakfasts. Sometimes it\u2019s nice to sit down and just be served. And as mentioned, the resort is a vacation all by itself. There are so many fun things to do here, besides the charming \"Sassagoula Steamboat\" that takes resort guests to-and-from downtown Disney, guests can rent boats of various sizes to sail yourself, or rent old-fashioned bikes to ride on the walkways, or pay for a lovely horse & carriage ride (everyone that does this raves about it!). (Please see photos) We love it because of of this wonderful 'Sassagoula Steamboat' service that takes you to and from your resort, to downtown Disney\u2019s Market Place. (Photo) The 'Sassagoula Steamboat' \u2018captains\u2019 are so friendly and helpful. Only Port Orleans Riverside & French Quarter resorts offer this wonderful steamboat service to-and-from Downtown Disney! It\u2019s such a fun and lovely relaxing steamboat ride\u2026.you will love it! It stops at the partner pretty resort, \u201cPort Orleans French Quarter\u201d, which is also a beautiful resort\u2014and a nice place to eat too---we love their \u201cPot Roast\u201d dinner at their Food Court and sometimes take the boat over there for dinner. Then the 'Sassagoula Steamboat' goes over to \u201cDowntown Disney\u201d. There you will find so many wonderful places to eat shop and see. We love the \u201cEarl of Sandwiches\u201d and Ghirardelli\u2019s Soda Fountain and Chocolate Shop (what a fun and yummy experience!) the \u201cRain Forest Caf\u00e9\u201d, etc. etc. Great if you have ticket to \"Cirque de Soliel\" which we also enjoyed on our last visit. Not to mention all the other wonderful things to see and do at Downtown Disney\u2019s Marketplace. It\u2019s wonderful day or night and a lovely 'Sassagoula Steamboat' ride home at night is such a delightful experience! (the last boat leaves at 11:00pm and after this you can take a bus to-and-from downtown disney to the resort) Another great thing at Port Orleans Riverside is \u201cFulton\u2019s General Store\u201d\u2014it\u2019s a fantastic shop! Great for gifts, treats and also necessities you might have forgotten from home (bandages, sunscreen, pharmacy type things etc.) And also a great place for late-night snacks, chips, cookies, Soda drinks, juice, milk etc.) Just like a little corner store---but even nicer! The staff there is so friendly too! One of the greatest things about staying on-site at Disney World, is the free transporation service to and from the resort to the various Disney Parks & Water Theme parks. The Disney buses run all the time, if you \u2018miss\u2019 one, don\u2019t worry or kill yourself running for it---as another one will come within a few minutes. (Always funny to see people running for the buses) The one that seemed to take the longest to arrive at Port Orleans Riverside, was the \u201cEpcot\u201d buses, not sure why\u2014 but happily the resort provides lovely shaded areas to sit and wait for the buses. However, during this last vacation, we did note that the lineups for some (not all) buses to return from parks to the resort were very long at certain parks/nights. It was a bit of a concern to us\u2014but hopefully Disney will allow for more buses at night for this resort. And this might only be because of the \u201cHappiest Celebration\u201d and the resort being totally booked, as we did not have this concern during our other Vacations. Not to be overlooked, the wonderful caring housekeepers at Port Orleans Riverside who are so adorable, this is our third vacation, and all the ones we have met are from Haiti. They are so sweet (some very shy), and so helpful. French is their native language, but most speak quite good English too. If you need anything, don\u2019t hesitate to kindly ask them or leave a note. We came prepared with little thank you envelopes for their tips and a written note in French for them\u2014and were so happy to leave little treats for them too. They deserve so much appreciation, as they work so hard to make your vacation so perfect. And as for the Front Desk cast members (staff), they are truly the best-of-the-best! The Managers are so helpful, if you have any sort of problem/concern, don\u2019t hesitate to kindly ask for their assistance. We sent them flowers at the end of this vacation; it was not much, but just a little something to let them know what an amazing job they are doing! In our opinion, after staying here for 3 years, (and comparing it to our other vacations where we stayed at other resorts) this resort is one of the best to visit on the entire Disney World site! And to finish off, the \u201cMagical Express\u201d was a wonderful way to end our trip! At the resort front desk area, they printed out our airplane boarding passes, and took our luggage for us to the airport for us!!! (We kept our carry-on luggage with the bellman) We were able to enjoy a leisurely lunch, catch the \u201cMagical Express\u201d bus to the airport, with only our carry-on luggage to care for. It was so easy and relaxing! Once they get this service all figured out---it\u2019s going to be the best! And if offered, after the 18 months, it will be worth paying for in the future, in our opinion. So as you can see, we once again highly recommend a stay at this beautiful \"Port Orleans Riverside\" resort! We are already planning our next vacation here!

We have previously also stayed at All Star Sports but feel that Riverside is well worth the extra $ (used AAA discount). We stayed in Alligator Bayou # 27 which was quiet and beautifully landscaped. There was also a laundry, quiet pool, and frig in room. The food court is great and provides affordable dining. The Riverside is so family friendly for all ages.

Great hotel for either families, couples , or groups. There are several front counter chk-in attendants so chk-in line always seems to move quickly. Now service is wonderful. real southern hospitality is displayed at Riverside. Anybody working there is more then willing to take the time to help you answer any questions or give you any advice on hotel or Disney parks etc. Rooms average size and very clean. Whenever we may have requested extra towels or anything else, they have been quick to respond. Food court is very reasonable and plenty to chose from. Buy the $12 refillable cups if staying more then 2 days. Worth the bucks & great for families on budget too. Refill them anytime at The Riverside hotel or even next door at the Port Orleans French Quarters Hotel with soda, coffee, ice tea or lemonade. The Boatrights restaurant is a bit pricey as are many hotel restaurants but food is good. Love the grounds!!! Very spacious & romantic setting. Many building are spread out through-out the property into 2 sections. One section being Alligator Bayou which the buildings are more rustic in appearance but rooms exact same layout. Magnolia Bend is the other section with buildings fashioned after old southern mansions. You can rent bikes or just stroll the walkways over the wooden bridges and along the river path . Take a walk on over to Port Orleans French Quarters hotel. Different hotel so don't confuse it with Port Orleans Riverside. Main pool is huge and also has a bar in pool area. Kids love the slide . I believe there are 5 more quiet pools inbetween the buildings and there are laundry facilities in each pool area. Just take a swim while laundry is is washing! We love the rose arbors in front of the Magnolia building and the gazebo there is a great place to sit and gaze at the river and watch the people stroll by. Take the water taxie boat down the river early evening to watch the sunset at Downtown Disney over Lake Buena Vista and grab a bite to eat at any of the restaurants in there or in Westside. Shop or see a movie and boat back to hotel and grab a late night snack at food court. There is also a horse drawn coarch ride that you can request & reserve in the evening for about $35 a half hour that is so romantic and takes you all around the huge hotel grounds and along the river. One other thing...there are 4 bus stops around the Riverside hotel gounds so it makes it very convienent to get a Park bus near your building. Love the idea of free buses into all Disney parks and Downtown etc. Makes vacation more relaxing after a long day walking the parks. No fighting traffic. So if you are looking for a hotel inside Disney World that has great grounds & room to walk and bike with great service and clean rooms....Then you can't go wrong with Port Orleans Riverside.

I travelled with my husband, our two kids (one of which is a toddler) and my older brother. We stayed in the Alligator Bayou section, because of the trundle bed which accomodated my 6 year old daughter. The trundle was really nothing more than a thin mattress on a roll out frame, but it served its purpose. The room had been recently renovated, and was very tastefully done. We found it to be comfortable, but slightly on the small side, as we also had a crib in the room. This left us with not much space to move around in the room, but we were not in the room during the day, so we could live with it at night. We liked the tile in the bathroom/vanity area and the decorative tile in the tub. My one complaint in terms of the bathroom/vanity area is that there was no room for you to put your \"stuff.\" The sinks were pedestal sinks, and while they looked nice, I really missed the counter space. The shelf that ran the length of the mirror above the sink was not very wide, and I was in constant fear that my cosmetic bag would fall off into the sink. However, this is just a minor flaw. The other thing I would change would be the fact that there are no closets in the room. There is a rack to hang your clothes bag on, and a curtain to draw across the vanity area so that you can get dressed in private, but I am not used to not having a closet. Our check-in was a breeze, and we had a very nice and knowledgeable cast member assist us. Our room was ready within an hour of arriving, and the bags were delivered promptly. We stayed in Building 14, which I would recommend to anyone. It was recently renovated, and close to everything, including the food court, the boat, the lobby, and most importantly, to the bus stop. We waited no more than 2-3 minutes for the buses which took us to the parks at all hours of the day. I recommend Disney transportation. Our 6 year old loved the main swimming pool and the arcade. You could check out a life vest for children at the marina, which was nice. The adults loved the boat that took us to the Port Orleans French Quarter and Downtown Disney. The guys who ferry the boats were very friendly and had lots of tidbits to impart about Disney and life in general. The food court served standard fare, but we were able to get fresh fruit for breakfast, which was a plus. My recommendation would be to get there before 8:00 am if you want to avoid the crowds. We only did one dinner there, which was just so-so. Boatwright's, the sit down restaurant, was expensive for the quality of food, especially at dinner, but my daughter loved the Mickey Mouse shaped pancake she got at breakfast. We took a special trip on the boat to Port Orleans French Quarter to see if their food court was any better. It was very similar, with the one outstanding difference being the beignets. Love that deep fried dough dipped in powdered sugar! We were fortunate to plan our stay at a good time, right when the last of the spring breakers had departed. One of the cast members told us that the resort was only 50% full at the time of our stay. I can't imagine what it would be like at capacity. Next time, I think we might try the Magnolia Bend \"mansions.\" They looked inviting. All in all, a good trip. We wish we would have had more time to explore the grounds and see the various critters scampering around. We had 2 bunnies that hung around outside our building that fascinated our toddler. But, alas, the theme parks called.

Port Orleans is a terrific property with GORGEOUS tropical grounds. I will give you that it is very spread out and somewhat hard to navigate, but it is because you get to walk around there lush landscape. I would recommend a mansion room if the thought of Alligator Bayou seems dark. We chose the Bayou this time because we have three children and needed the trundle bed that this property offers. I visited my parents in the mansion rooms and they were beautiful. As nice as my brother and his family had at the pricey Beach Club on the concierge floor. The pool was a lot of fun,clean, had a fun water slide and included a pool side bar. My teen, 9 year old, and three year old ALL had a great time. Port Orleans also offers ferry to Downtown Disney, Surrey Bikes for families to ride around the grounds, and Water Sprites to drive around the river and Downtown Disney lake area.

We stayed at Port Orleans Riverside. What a vacation. We didn't tell our 2 girls(10 and turning 8 while there) they were going until we woke them up to go. They were very excited. Their first plane ride and also limo ride to the airport. My oldest daughter was exhausted by the time we got there and ended up getting sick that day and we could not get into our rooms till later in the day. I kept calling and they finally found us a room. When we arrived our keys did not work but that is because they were for the first room we were supposed to get, so keep that in mind if your room gets switched before actually entering. They did send someone with new key cards but that took about 40 mins. Any other time you wouldn't mind the wait but when your daughter wants to get into an airconditioned room mins seem like hours. Finally at 6:30 our vacation began and it was magical till the day we left. My other daughter had her 8th birthday there. We had arranged (free of charge) to have a birthday card of her favourite disney character autographed and delivered to our room with balloons. She was tickled with that. We also had it arranged that goofy would give her a wake up call on her birthday also free of charge. We booked the Princess Storybook Princess Breakfast in Norway (Epcot) on her birthday. 5 storybook princesses were there and they come to your table and fuss over you and you get their autograph and pics taken. That was the highlight of her trip. It was a bit pricey but worth it. ($70 something for breakfast but our reservations were for 11:30 so we made it lunch and it was excellent food). You are seated and have fresh fruit and carmel buns waiting for you. Then your meal comes which is a great big skillet filled with bacon, biscuits, sausages, eggs and potato casserole. You are definetly filled at the end and soon after the princesses come by. I will tell you that you must book before 3 months in advance. I left it till 3 weeks and was dissappointed that everything was booked solid but they told me to keep calling which I did and finally got a reservation but I strongly recommend that you do it as soon as you book your trip as to not be dissappointed because they did say that most of them book up 3-4 months ahead. Lots of pools to swim in. The biggest one being the themed pool which is in the french quarter which is about a 10 min walk or you can take the boat there which runs frequently. The rooms in the hotel we nice, not overly big but standard size for a hotel. Everything was clean and what a bonus having a fridge which was a very good size and coffee maker. Our car that we ordered to pick us up at the airport made a free grocery stop for us at publix store so we did a bit of food shopping for our room. We decided to eat breakfast in our room so we wouldn't be rushed and could make the parks by opening time. The girls just ate cereal or muffins and fruit, same with us. We bought cheese and crackers and bread, pb, and jam. We brought our own bowls, utensils and cups and lots of snacks because snacks are very expensive here and add up over 10 days. We brought granola bars, scooby snacks, candies, suckers, cookies etc... We saved lots by doing this and time in the morning. They provided coffee packs each day too. We just went to the food court and \"borrowed\" creamer each evening to have for our morning coffee. No one seemed to mind and if they are providing coffee machines they should provide the creamer and sugar too right. We did invest in 2 of the refillable mugs and our girls loved the fact they could have whatever they wanted and as much. We purchased a few bottles of water the first day and just kept filling them up at the soda machines where you fill up your refillable mugs. The money you saved doing this and once again we did this everyday, lots of times for 10 days and no one approached us saying we could not do that. Water is a must in WDW and why should you have to pay for it. We filled up in the morning and took with us to the parks. Another little trick I came up with is to go to the dollar store before you come to WDW and pick up glow stick necklaces and braclets. I brought about $12 worth of the stuff and gave them to the girls each night we went out to a night show. They never once asked to purchase any of the glowing nick nacks that they try to sell to you for the price of large pizza. Rip off I say. We had lots of people come up to us and ask where they could buy them. Alot of the rides come out into the gift shops, very clever I say. We gave the girls there own money and told them to spend it wisely. They spent most on the trading pins there and never really asked to buy alot of the other stuff. We usually b-lined it right out of the store to go to the next ride so they never really had a chance to browse and want. You could spend lots of money on stuff that you will probably never use when you get home and the prices are high but some reasonable stuff too. The pins are begin 6.95-8.95 US. If you are the first family rider on a ride when the park opens they give you a free 5X7 photo and may escort you to another ride and be first in line. That happened to us twice once at splash mtn and the other at buzz lightyear. The new Stitch ride, which is not a ride at all is horrible and the line ups are like 60mins long. Most dissappointing. You go in and watch a clip, then run to the next mission and sit in these seats with shoulder bars and they come down and you think you are going on a ride but all you get is wet and smelly stuff in your ear and that is it. So don't wait for it if you don't have too. Tower of terror in MGM was awesome, so was Rock'n'Roller Coaster. Lots of good rides. The parks were somewhat busy but not too bad. Plan what you want to do and take advantage of the early opening of the parks if you stay on a disney resort. It is early to get up but you can get all your big rides done before the park opens and the crowds come. We played till about 2-3 each day then went back to our resort to swim, relax, have supper, then plan to see one of the night spectacular shows every other night or take advantage of the park closing late which would be till 12. The parks can still be busy at the time too. The shuttle system was excellent and we never seemed to wait for a bus more than 10-15 mins. I strongly suggest hitting the internet and printing off the schedule for what shows are what nights, late and early openings etc... and do what I did is make up a 10 day schedule of what you want to do each day and also each day indicate which park has the early and late opening so you have all your options available to you right on one piece of paper. You might want to find on the internet which rides are open when you have the early and late closing because it isn't all of them. I printed everything off and took stuff with me and each night we read and researched everything we wanted to do the next day and in which order. Walkie talkies would have been nice if you are not always going to do the same things. I printed off disney coloring pics to take with us for the girls to color on the plane. They liked that and it killed time. I also went to the dollar store and found mickey mouse note pads which we used as autograph books. We got tons of autographs and never really had to wait in much of a line up. And there were lots of characters around all the time. In Magic Kingdom you can go to the fair section right in the very back or the park by the mad tea cup party and the go cart car ride and in the section you will privately meet mickey mouse and have your photo taken by a photographer or they will just use your own camera.

Both times were good experiences. The grounds are beautiful. I would reccomend staying on Magnolia Bend, although it is a little bit more of a walk to get to the lobby & food court. My room was clean and towels, toiletries were plentiful both trips. I did not travel with any children, but had brought a beanie baby that resembles my dog with me. Each day I returned to my room to find her doing something else in my absence--watching TV, looking out the window, watersliding in the sink, etc. Cute touch, and would be magic for a kid. The room was big enough for 3 adults. There is plenty of room for your personal toiletries on the bathroom shelf, unless you travel with a lot of cosmetics. The food court is good--still theme park food, but was very hot and fresh. I would reccomend the loaded fries and the nachos, BBQ and Burgers. Breakfast can be very crowded at about 8-8:15, but we timed ourselves to be getting done by then. The refillable mug is the best deal in Disney. My family drinks a lot of soda, and this mug gets you as many refills of soda, coffee or tea that you want. Too bad they don't include a juice or milk at breakfast time, though! My 10/04 trip was a second honeymoon. For all you romantic couples--the horse-drawn carraige ride after dusk is a must. The grounds are beautifully lit with old style gas lights, which reflect off the river. So romantic! I did notice a difference in the staff during my 10/04 trip. Not so many smiles, not so eager to interact with guests. I attributed that to the fact that much of the state had recently been devastated by hurricaines, and that the residents of Florida probably weren't feeling too \"magical\" at the time of my visit. The bus system is great. That alone is reason enough to stay on property. If you don't rent a car and want to get to other non-Disney theme parks you can get a ride on a paid shuttlebus (I suggest Mears for $12 per person, roundtrip). My hsuband and I spent most of the time waiting for our Disney bus(5-10 min, max) singing \"Magic Bus\" by the Who. We waited much longer for the Mears shuttle, with no apology that they were late. All in all, this is a good value. You can easily entertain kids at the resort all day long with the pools, arcade and other activites.

The rooms are all outside rooms, not inside. Just cautioning you because I did not expect outside rooms. Our family is fortunate in that our daughter works at Disneyland so we were able to take advantage of a 50% off discount. We had two rooms, parents in one room and 18 and 23 year old in another room. We were there during Easter week from Easter Sunday through Saturday. I thought the hotel would be more crowded but I guess people come and go to all the different parks so it was never as crowded as I expected. The rooms are a nice size. We had two queen beds in each room. We orginally were going to have 3 to a room but two other kids couldn't go. Good thing because we would have had a tight fit in those beds. If you had two parents in one bed and two small children in the other bed you could probably get by in one room. Interestingly, I had originally asked if we could have a trundle bed placed in each room for the 3rd person and they said they do not allow extra beds. However, in both rooms there were trundle beds underneath one of the beds so, in fact, we could have slept 3 in each room on separate beds. As others have mentioned there is no high speed access but you can suffer with dial up that is going to cost you. The bathroom/tub is a small space but the waterpic shower head and water pressure are good. They give you plenty of towels (we always ask for more). Lots of drawer space. The weird thing is that we had double pedestal sinks. A nice feature, but when you have pedestal sinks that means you won't have counter space. They make for that by putting a shelf above the sinks. But it isn't very wide and once there are cups, shaving gear, make-up gear, etc. on the ledge you won't find much room left. We didn't have any problem with noise since we were upstairs. I would advise asking for an upstairs room for two reasons: 1) you won't have anyone above you and, 2) You're pretty much going to just be sleeping in the room anyway so having to walk up one flight of stairs is really no bother at all. We stayed in building 36. The room numbers are like 3624, 3625, etc. If you have a number around 3635 you will be upstairs. I think less that 3620 is downstairs. In this particular building the pool behind the building was open 24 HOURS!! Luckily, from what I saw people had sense enough not to use the pool at all hours of the evening, although they could have. Other pools had restricted ours of 10 or 11pm. Our room was facing away from the pool and was not near the river. Believe me, there isn't any advantage facing the pool or the river because, honestly, if you want to stare at either of them it is a 60 second walk to either. Unlike the neighboring PO-French Quarter's one bus stop, the Riverside has 4 bus stops located on the South (lobby), West, North, and East sides of the resort. This makes it convenient when waiting for buses to the amusement parks. The bus transportation is free and is prompt and comfortable. If you miss a bus another will be by in a few minutes. I don't think we waited more than 10 minutes at any time and most times were waiting 5 minutes or less. I have posted 10 pictures of what our room looked like when we were in it. Anyone can show you a clean room but I wanted to show you the space, or lack thereof, available when you start unpacking and placing your items around the room. You can see those pictures by going to the picture viewing area. I posted them separate from this review. However, I am posting a view of the pedestal sinks so you can see the set up in that area and lack of space. As for food...make sure you stock up on water and snacks OUTSIDE of the park. The rooms have refrigerators so you can stuff them with drinks if you'd like. If you buy a 12oz bottle of water at the Riverside general store it's going to cost you 1.25, while a 24oz bottle will cost you 2.00. We ate all of our meals in the cafeteria. The cafeteria offers breakfast until 11am. Each of the counters has different food, like pizza, hot dogs, etc. In the morning they all offer different breakfasts, after 11am they all offer different lunches and dinners. Disney makes it \"convenient\" to hook your credit card into you resort card/room key so that you can use the card at the hotel or in any of the parks. All of your keys will be activated so if you have kids with cards, watch out because they can use them. A typcial breakfast platter will cost you about 5.95. You get scrambled eggs, one sausage, 3 bacon, a very small biscuit and some wedge potatoes. If you buy a small orange juice in a plastic bottle you can plan on spending around 8-8.50 for a breakfast. It adds up quick. The good thing is that the food court stays open late in the evening to accommodate the late park returnees. As for activities, you can rent two seater boats, fish off a bridge, off the bank, off a boat, you can rent bikes, two seater bikes, 4 seater bikes with kiddie baskets in front. You can take the busses to Downtown Disney or you can take a boat to Downtown Disney (recommended at least once). All in all it was a good stay for us. Oh, one other thing. Someone mentioned about hearing the toilets in other rooms. Yep, they have those super-duper toilets that work like the ones you find in planes. When you pull down the handle you'll hear a loud swoosh that is almost deafening. So be prepared the first time you do that because you're going to be surprised.

Our stay was just before the high season, so we paid $132.50 a night with AAA discount for a water view room. Our \"water view\" was a diagonal view of the pool area, so I don't recommend paying extra for this feature. There was no line at check-in, which took about 10 minutes. The grounds were clean and, well groomed making the resort a nice place for a morning walk. The hotel was relatively uncrowded when we were there. We had no problems with traffic or parking. The breakfast at Boatwrights was outstanding, though a bit expensive (around $35 for two). Our room was reasonably sized, well decorated and clean. However, none of the reviews mentioned that the walls are paper thin. On our first night, the upstairs neighbors returned to their room with two small children at 3:30 AM. (Who keeps their kids out until 3:30 AM?) Although we couldn't make out every word, we could hear their conversations from downstairs. We could also hear their toilet use and flushes from our room. We bought earplugs the next day. Note that it costs 75 cents to make a local call and the hotel does not offer high-speed Internet access. Overall, I'd recommend Port Orleans Riverside (along with a set of earplugs). However, if I had to do it over again, I wouldn't pay the premium to stay at this Disney resort.

We stayed in the Allagator Bayou section in Lodge 37. Check in was a breeze. They immediately charged my card for the amount of the stay, but we were given a $1000 room charge credit limit without them even putting an additional hold on my credit card, which I thought was nice, and which is always important info for me. Some hotels automatically put a hold on your account for the amount of your room plus an extra couple hundred dollars for amounts they think you might rack up on room incidentals, and if you're like me, this could tie up some of the spending money you have available while you're on vacation. We made our reservations through AAA and got a rate of $143 per night. Our room was clean upon arrival, and did include a complementary mini-fridge even though on the hotel info it says a fridge is an extra $10 per night. It isn't. There is no extra charge. This was nice, but on the other hand the fridge sucked. It wasn't very cold at all. We had our little girl with us who is still on the bottle and were afraid to store her milk in there because of worrying about it spoiling. I'm not sure if this is the case with all of the fridges or if maybe the one in our room was just older or torn up. The armoire that holds the tv is tall, but when my husband reached up there to store a bag, all kinds of dust came tumbling down. I requested they change the sheets after the second night of our stay(I did leave a tip that day) and the sheets that they changed the bed with had a few small holes in it. I think this may be due to over bleaching, and wasn't that great big of a deal, but not something I would expect from Disney. The housekeeping staff was friendly and did a very good job. One day we returned from the park and 2 dolls my little girl had left in the room were laying propped on the bed in little towel \"doll beds\" the staff had created. So cute and such a sweet touch. They do a good job, but I think a few \"deep cleaning\" days should be squeezed in for the rooms when they're not occupied to clear up little problems like the dust on top of the tv armoire. Also, I would recommend to anyone with a child for whom you are bringing a stroller along, especially if it isn't one of those little collapsible ones be sure if you stay in Allagator Bayou to ask for a room on the bottom floor. The Allagator Bayou lodges have no elevators and we had to lug our big, heavy stroller up and down several steps several times during the course of our stay to get it to our room. It did come in very handy though, as the walk around the grounds to get to the pool, general store, and food court was about 10 minutes for adults, and even longer if you let your dawdling toddler walk on their own! So take that stroller. The pool was nice and we loved that the water was heated and the slide. Life guards were very attentive. I thought the food at the food court was very good. Expensive, as to be expected, but good. A burger and fry basket was around $7. A small pizza was around $7. A can of soda was $1.79 so if you have room in your suitcase pack a few 12 packs if you're a soda lover. This is what we did instead of buying the free refill cups simply because it was so much more convenent to have soda in our room than to make that journey over to the food court to get the free refill every time we were thirsty. We didn't use any of the transportation because we drove and planned on taking our big stroller into the parks with us, which isn't allowed on the buses. Being a resort guest, you get free parking at the parks anyway. All you do is show them your room key as you enter the park where they normally collect parking fees and you're in. It was a nice visit. Everyone on staff that we dealt with was very nice.If you order the pizza delivery be aware that a 15% delivery charge is automatically added onto your total so you don't double tip like I did. I'm a server, so I'm all about tipping, but the guy just had about a 7 or 8 minute walk from the food court to our room and for that he ended up receiving a $4.50 automatically added in tip, plus I tipped him another $4 because I didn't know it was already added until I looked at the receipt after he left. He ended up getting an $8.50 tip on a $26 order. He was nice, but not THAT nice! Just a little heads up! I know this is long, and I apologize but hopefully some of this info will help. I would possibly go back if it were just my husband and myself, but not taking the kids again. The property is just a little bit too spread out for having to walk to and from things with little ones. Also, if you're going for the water sports. The fishing is cane pole only and my husband says the fish are conditioned to having all the people around and you can see them come right up to the worms and then swim away, and the Sea Racers have a very low maximum speed set on them. They're not like the ones you see racing around at your local river. They go fairly slow.

There were five of us (3 kids) so we stayed in Alligator Bayou to get the extra trundle bed. We started in building 15. The room was fine, but on Day 3 we were woken up by loud renovation construction going on in a room next door. Disney completely shut down Building 14 for total renovation (it is now done) and somehow the renovation leaked over into 15 - which was stupid considering that 15 was pretty well occupied. Anyhow, Disney eventually moved most if not everybody out of Building 15. We were moved to 18, which was terrific - we got a good chance to see the difference between a renovated room (in Bldg 18) and a non-renovated room (in 15). The room in 18 was much nicer. We also got 50% off our room for the day we were woken by drills. That was the bad part - though Disney basically handled it well, if slowly. The good part is that the grounds at PO-R are beautiful, the food is good, and the pools are great. The best part about PO-R is piano man Bob - his act in the lounge is not to be missed. Both adults and kids loved him. I don't know what they pay him, but it isn't enough. Like the Disney Theme Parks, you can expect to stand in some lines at PO-R. Check-in, even at 8 pm, likely means a 10 to 15 minute line. The food court has some irritating lines, though - again - the food is good and the prices really aren't bad. The folks in the back right corner - where you would get burgers, Phillys, chicken strips, etc., are RIDICULOUSLY slow. The free boat transportation to PO-FQ and Downtown Disney is excellent. The boat operators were terrific and great sources of information. The bus service to the parks was basically OK. We typically had waits of 5-15 minutes for everything. We had one awful wait - nearly an hour to get a bus from MGM Park back to PO-R mid-afternoon on a Wednesday. While a huge gang of us waited, we watched buses for the other disney resorts come and go at least twice each. In my opinion, Disney Transportation simply does not yet have a good handle on the Port Orleans complex. It is one of if not the biggest resort, and therefore needs additional buses. Once the buses do come, they are jammed. I don't feel it is acceptable for Disney to expect people to be standing and jammed on every PO bus. The parks were terrific. The Magic Kingdom was magical, and Animal Kingdom and Epcot were great. MGM Studios is OK, and the Tower of Terror and Rock ' n Roller Coaster there are MUST-rides. The best ride is at Epcot - I think it is called Mission Space. Absolutely remarkable - but DO NOT ride if you are prone to motion sickness. Mission Space is very different, very original, and very - ah - convincing. The bottom line is that my family & I had a terrific time in Orlando. PO-R, though not perfect, is a good option for those who don't want the hassles associated with staying off-site. The \"magic\" is found in the parks, not at the Disney resorts. I'm sure we'll be back to Disney World in a year or two. We may well return to PO-R. All things considered, for the money it was a decent deal.

I have never stayed on Disney Property before so I was excited to go there with my husband and see what it was like. We used the free transportation shuttle bus from the Country Inn and Suites to Epcot and then took the free bus to the resort. Check in was a breeze at 12PM and off we went to our room in the Magnolia Terrace building. It took us almost 5 minutes to walk around the whole building to find our room and once we entered, we were disappointed with a dirty room. There was a dirty glass filled with water on one of the pillows in the room, the sink was filled with blue toothpaste and the garbage barrel was filled to the top. We called the front desk an they graciously moved us to another room. I did, however, have to walk back to the front desk, wait in line for 5 minutes and then wait another 10 minutes for the girl at check in to figure out what was going on. I got another room key and we moved to another room about 5 doors down. On the surface the room looked so much better but after searching for the remote control that was missing, we found 3 dirty tissues under the bedskirts, a used cap filled with couch syrup and about 15 M&M's all over the floor. We didn't want to move so we just left them there for the full three nights we stayed. Housekeeping did deliver our Remote control in a few minutes. Our new room had the worst overhead fan in the bathroom that kept making loud \"knocking\" noises when it was shut off. The first night was so loud in the middle of the night, that I thought someone was knocking on our door. The next two nights had me turning on the light in the bathroom the entire night to prevent the knocking noises. They weren't kidding about the toilet flushing noises from other rooms...boy was that loud. With that said, the resort itself was wonderful. It was spread out beautifully but it ended up killing me after my marathon on Sunday. It normally took me about 6 minutes to walk over the two bridges to get to the food court but my knee was so swollen after the race that it took me almost 15 minutes to walk to get something to eat. Not the resorts fault but I was dying. The free transportation to and from the resorts and the marathon was wonderful. Never had to wait more than 5 minutes to get a bus. I don't know if anyone had this problem but I was looking for a computer with internet access everywhere on Disney property and could not find one. The only place I knew that had internet access was DisneyQuest and I was not paying the admission fee to log onto a computer. I went to 5 different properties and could not find a business center in any of them. Oh well... I don't think I will be staying on Disney property again. It was convenient but not worth the extra cash in my opinion. I loved the Country Inn and Suites and the Fairfield Inn in Lake Buena Vista. I like having all of the food places within walking distance and having the Supermarkets and Walgreens right there.

The FQ playground is you standard modern plastic and metal version, probably safer, but less fun! Our room in Magnolia Terrace was very nice and looked freshly renovated.

One needs to know that there are basically two parts to this resort, the Alligator Bayou section and the Magnolia Bend section. We stayed at the Magnolia Bend section which is lovely in architecture - fashioned in the style of a southern plantation. The Alligator Bayou section is still nice, but not as nice as Magnolia Bend, in our opinion. Everything was clean and neat, and very efficient. The setting of the entire complex is peaceful and relaxing. By way of comparison, my husband and I had breakfast one morning at the Animal Kindgom Lodge and it had a more frenetic atmosphere. We much preferred ours, and noticed that a lot of couples, both young and old, were staying at the Port Orleans Riverside. There is a pool on the \"island\" part that you cross to get to Boatwright's Restaurant, and that pool is more for children.-slides and such and lifeguards. The pools in the various Magnolia Bend sections were more peaceful and enjoyable for an older couple such as ourselves. We enjoyed Boatwrights for breakfast. Breakfast selections were great! The Sassagoula Swing drink is delicious!! Evening meals were still good, but did not have as many menu items that we enjoy eating, even though very well prepared. We enjoyed meeting Sue at the restaurant- she is one of the \"seaters\" and is very enjoyable to chat with- she is at the breakfast shift. We do recommend, though, that one take advantage of priority seating, which Disney World offers. On Friday and Saturday nights in particular, the wait can be an hour or longer if you do not have priority seating. All the resort staff with whom we came in contact were courteous and friendly. We rented a car and are glad we did. It gave us so much more freedom- we did not have to wait for buses. If you do rent a car, we strongly suggest that you ask the resort for maps on how to get back to the resort at night- the first two nights we got lost, coming from the varous parks. Going is not a problem. It is the coming back that is a bit confusing, especially at night. Enjoyed the various parks- MGM and Animal Kingdom were our favorites. Downtown Disney was fun as well.

We loved our room, you've seen the pictures online, small yes but well kept and a nice warm feeling. We stayed in the Magnolia section of the hotel and we were just a short walk to the bus stop and the foot bridge to cross the river. Our first night we bought milk and some snacks for our stay and found our refrigerator was not getting very cold. The next morning I called the front desk and when we had returned from the parks, a new refrigerator was in the room, cold and had been stocked with our snacks! By that time, the other refrigerator was very cold and we had two! Great for kids. The pool is so fun with the showers and the slide. You can sign out a life jacket for the little guys the whole time you are there and it is free. My little guy loved that he could go down the slide and did not need to be caught by one of us. I was at Disney a few years ago but never stayed in a hotel, but I can say that the hotels and parks are geared towards adults now too! You are allowed to carry alcoholic beverages anywhere, even on the ferry boat down the river to downtown disney. Nothing was better than sipping a cold beer and sailing down the river at night. The trails around the pool are fun, my son rented a bicycle and had a blast! We ate in the sit down restaurant for breakfast and the food was great, moderately priced and well worth it. I would suggest calling when you wake up and make a reservation so you don't have to wait. The food court is great too! At first I was turned off by it, but all the food turned out to be great. We are already planning our next trip and we know where we are going to stay, Port Orleans!! If you are the type to complain about every little thing, then don't go anywhere.

All in all, this was the best vacation ever, I'm 28 and have been to a lot of places but this was great! And the water parks, so much fun!! One more suggestion, if you buy the park hoppers, go to a park early and come home around 2or3p. Take a nap, trust me you will love it and the kids will too! Then go back out after dinner. Downtown disney is so much fun, all my son kept saying was \"I love this place mom.\" And all we had bought him was a $4 package of Legos. The atmosphere is incredible and the clubs are fun too.

We loved these for coffee in the morning while you're waiting for the bus or a soda in the afternoon. Disney transportation is one of the best parts of the park. It's so nice to leave your car in the hotel parking lot and not have to see it again for the rest of the week. We went to Disney with my cousins and aunt and uncle a couple of years ago and the best investment you can make when you have a larger group is two way walkie talkies. My cell phone didn't have service when we were there so these were perfect when we all wanted to meet for dinner but wanted to go to different parks during the day. Also when we went in May a different park was open 3 hours later every night only for Disney resort guests. This was very nice so we could sleep in and enjoy the cooler nights and less lines at the park. This is a great resort but I have found it's hard to go wrong when you stay anywhere Disney. Oh and another tip the amount of car break ins at the resort parking lots is enormous be sure to park in a well-lit area and not to leave ANYTHING in your car. We've never had anything happen but it's better to be safe then to end your vacation filling out a police report.", "Date": "September 26, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "ENGLAND.UK.MANCHESTER", "Title": "\u201cBIG FUN IN FLORIDA\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2499526", "Content": "We visited florida for 2 Weeks from 07 August 2004.

Some of the reader reviews on here worried me slightly too! (I have a fussy family!!) We arrived quite late in the day and one of the few bad points I should mention is that check-in does take a long time. We were thankful it wasn't busy and we'd not had to wait in a 'line' to be served! We made our way to our rooms and were disappointed to find my parents hadn't been given the Waterview Room they had pre-paid for and also my room and my sister's was inter-connecting - which is normally good fun - but this was her Honeymoon and we did need to be a few doors away!!! We went back to Reception, they moved my parents over to the Magnolia Bend side (we were originally in the Alligator Bayou side) and they got a beautiful room with a Waterview. It was extremely clean, well kept - their only minor complaint was that a new shower-head would be needed soon. We also got moved to seperate rooms in the Alligator Bayou, which were very nice too. Clean, well kept and had a traditional rustic Port Orleans type feel!! Both room changes were done with NO problems, they were more than happy to accommodate our requests. However, after seeing my parents room - it felt much lighter and more spacious so my sister & I cheekily asked if it was possible for us to have rooms in Magnolia Bend and again they were only too happy to move us, even upgrading us to King Bedrooms!! We didn't have a long walk to the main lobby / restaurant area and we also had a bus stop right behind our building so this was excellent. We didn't eat in the main restaurant but the menu looked good and prices reasonable. We did eat a few meals, including breakfast most mornings, in the \"Food Court\" area. They served just about anything you could want. Muffins, pastries, omlettes, pancakes, bacon, eggs, fruit and cereal in the morning. Then from lunchtime until late late at night they served freshly prepared salads, pre-packed sandwichs & salads, pizzas, pasta, hot dogs, burgers, chicken, fries, tacos - also ice creams, crisps, chocolate & other deserts. I would recommend spending the $11.99 on a drinks mug. It allows you to refil drinks throughout the duration of your stay. We were there for 2 weeks and had a fair few afternoons and late morning relaxing so got full use out of them. We hired a boat and used the boat to Downtown Disney a few times - it's so much nicer than the bus!! We spent an evening by the pool near our building and it was wonderful, very relaxing, great atmosphere, very clean. The only downside were the toilets being locked (it was 9pm ish) and of course the mosquitos!!!!! The main pool was also great, plenty of shade there if you're not really a sun-lover. We only encountered one slight problem when our cleaner cut herself on my boyfriends razor - the hotel kindly asked if he would go to a local clinic for blood tests. He's a good man so had no issues with this, it was just an inconvenience to us and wasted at least a day of the holiday whilst he waited to be seen and when we went back for the (negative) results!!! The hotel was still good about this and provided two of our rooms with complimentary fridges as a goodwill gesture.

Only 1 tiny hiccup - no coffee/tea makers in the room. In a hotel of this magnitude I expected one as you either carried coffee back to your room for breakfast, or schlepped the insulated mugs around with you.

We just returned from 4 nights at the Port Orleans Riverside with our 2 kids (1 and 4). We had an absolutely fabulous time!!! Room: Our room was in Magnolia Bend 8311, which was in Acadia House, directly in front of the stairwell. The room was in great condition, there was unlimited hot water, the beds were comfortable (although the pillows were a little flat). We requested bed rails both through the reservations number and through the front desk, but had to call housekeeping from the room to get them. Housekeeping was fine, no complaints...although tipping didn't get us any towel animals or anything other than basic housekeeping. Pool: The main pool was warm and there were plenty of lounge chairs both in the sun and in the shade. The slide was fun, although there should be no reason not to allow parents to slide down with the smaller children. Many parents were reprimanded for this, myself included. If you visit the pool bar, bring bugspray. A few angry (horseflies?) bugs took some bites out of us. Recreaction: The surrey bikes were fun, as were the rental boats. We loved riding down the Sassagoula River to Downtown Disney and back. You get to see some beautiful 2-story \"treehouses\". We couldn't figure out if they were part of the golf package or what. Dining: I have to admit that we only ate once in the cafeteria, and once in Boatwright's. It wasn't exactly our type of food (and a little overpriced for what it was). Instead we ate at Kimono's at the Swan, Rainforest Cafe in Downtown Disney, and the Yachtsman Steak House at the Yacht Club.

On arrival after a ten hour flight and our seven year old as excited as anyone can be, we were really pleased at the warm welcome we were given by the Disney staff. They really made a fuss of him as soon as they noticed his English accent and he was quite happy to sit and watch the TV in reception while we checked in. I had purchased the unofficial guide and had picked out some of the buildings that they advised were quiet but unfortunately we had been placed in one of the buildings which they rated as noisy. No problem, said the receptionist and immediately swopped us. Our room was very clean and the maid service was superb. In all European hotels we hire a fridge for 14 nights ususally at a cost of $2 per night and was astounded at the cost required by Disney! We did without. My criticisms of the resort are as follows; The service in the food court is slow due to the large number of guests especially at busy times. We were also disappointed that the boat from Downtown Disney was sometimes cancelled on the journey back but found throughout all of our visit that the Disney transportation was excellent. Our room was next to the West Depot and it was like our own personal taxi service. The drink refills are excellent and I have saved our cups as we are again visiting in July 2004 and hope to be able to get the same room. Port Orleans is excellent for a comfortable vacation.

And you should expect high quality from disney, especially with the prices you pay. Flight-Our flight to orlando was delayed almost two hours, so we were already aggrivated when we arrived. then our patience was tested again. were unsure of where to go to get our Mears shuttle. We had to get all our crap, find the mears desk, wait in that line, get our tickets, drag all our crap outside get on the bus...it was just annoying traveling stuff. We had'nt eaten for a long time, and we missed a good portion of our day in the park becasue of our delay. Arrival/CHeck in-So when we finally arrived at Riverside, we were starving, and we were tired, and aggrivated. But the welcome really brightened us up. A staff member greeted us as we got off of the bus and she took our bags while we checked in. The check in line was long, but the lobby was really nice atmopsphere. THe check in lady explained everything to us, and answered all of our questions, gave us maps and information,and was really informative. Then we went back outside to get our bags and they got a bellman to drive us and our stuff to our rooms. He was also really helpful with directing us around and just telling us general information about the park and stuff. Room-Our room was in the second farthest from the lobby in the Alligator Bayuo. And the drive to the room seemed really far. But I was glad to see that the bus depot was only a two minute walk from our room, and the pool was just around the corner. And the more we walked back and forth from the lobby to our room, the more we got used to the walk. It only ended up being about a 7 minute walk...not bad. Youre in disney...youre gonna walk. So anyway, the room was clean. I've read complaints here and there about the rooms being dirty. Maybe those people got stuck in rooms with new maids. Maybe they just had bad luck. Or maybe we had good luck. I don't know. But our room was clean. Would i soak in the bath tub? no....but im a germophobe. I wouldn't soak in a hotel bathtub. The shower curtains looked brand new, the floor behind the toilet was clean, there were no stains on the walls, the remote to the tv was clean, the lamp shades were clean. The bed spread looked and smelled clean. overall i was satisfied. Our heat worked really well....yes i said HEAT haha. It was chilly while we were there. Our maid took into account the way we slept in the bed, how we didnt like the sheets tucked in, what blankets we used, how many pillows we used, and thats the way she made the bed every day. I thought that was really thoughtful.The furniture in the room was of good quality. Lots of drawer space. Nice little table and chair....hooks to hang stuff....lighting is bright enough. Nuff said about the room. It was a good hotel room.Pool Ahhh...the pool. I'm sure every disney vacation needs at least one trip to the pool to wind down. The main pool at Riverside was nice. A good size. Its not all crazy with the sea serpant (or whatever it is) like the one at the frech quarter...it fits the theme of the resort. Its big, theres a fun slide for kids (or silly grown ups like me and my hunny) to slide down. Its heated. Attentive life guards. Clean towels provided. And to help ease the pain of walking all day and night, theres a nice little jacuzzi. Theres a bar right at the pool, so you can get a drink and sip it in the hot tub...i dont knwo if youre really allowed to do that. but thats what we did every night hah.Food So theres a food court and a resturaunt. Maybe it was just me and my fiance, but we didn't like the resturaunt. We read some good stuff about it so we were looking forward to it. We ate there once for breakfast and once for dinner. Well my fiance threw up the breakfast and I had an upset stomach all night from dinner. It was pretty pricey too. The food court was fine. I think it depends what you choose. The bacon, frech toast, pancakes, and cinnimon buns were good. It was pricey for a food court though. Cereal, milk, and grapes was like, 6-7 dollars. We did buy those refillable mugs. They were good idea. They weren't very big though. And there's a little sink set up in the food court to wash out your cup too. Our Boating Excursion-They have boats there that you can rent, for reasonable prices, and you can drive them around the river, its actually like a swamp i guess...heh. The river goes all through Port Orleans, Old Key West and into Downtown Disney. They had boats in three sizes, a teeny little boat for two people, a medium sized boat and a bigger party boat. We decided to get the little boat, becasue we thought it was go faster. Not really, they were all adjusted to only be able to reach like, 12 mph. So we rose all around in that little boat for about an hour, and on our way back to the dock, the motor shorted out, and we couldnt get the boat started again! My fiance just kept pulling and pulling to try to get it going, but it wasnt working. So we had to hollar for the construction workers at French Quarter to call RIverside and tell them we were standed in the middle of the lake. THen our boat started taking on some water....apparently thats what they do when theyre not moving....it was exciitng....But for our troubles they let us take a big party boat out. That was great. He drove the boat and i layed out and got a little tan. We drove down town, docked our boat and went shopping for a little bit. The groundsThe property was beautiful. The landscaping was really outstanding. It is a little confusing to find your way around at first, but we got used to it after walking to the food court a few times. It is a pretty big place. overall, i really reccomend Riverside.

I had requested 3 rooms in the Oak Manor Mansions water views. When we arrvied we had all 3 rooms side by side and two connected together. Off to a perfect start. The rooms are ok. Clean. Everything looks old(aged). The grounds are very well kept. Spread out though. I requested the Oak Manor knowing it was close to the food, lobby ect... The theme of the resort is really neat. Tom Sowyer , steam boat. The first moring on the 19th we ate in the resturant instead of the food court. The waitress was so Rude and I could tell she was use to dealing with rude people on a daily basis, because she was so defensive right from the start. I had eggs and oj and coffee my bill was $ 25.00. I would never do that again. Always use food court same food same sitting half the price. We then took the bus to down town disney no wait for the bus. Had lunch at Rain Forest Cafe (vey nice). We went to the Disneys Very Merry Xmas Party from 7:00 to 12:00. It was wonderful everything was perfect. Lines were a bit crowded for the free group photo so we passed on that. All the good rides were packed as well. Its a small world. peter pan ect... The best part of the evening was the fire works at 9:15. It was the best fire works display we had ever seen. The sky was glowing in colors in all directions. We all went the Roosters Lounge on Saturday night at the Po Riverside Resort. Very friendley staff. We saw the piano man who entertained us all. Including the kids . We all sang christams carols and disney songs. Group participation a must. He had everyone sing my son Happy Birthday and really made him feel special. He makes up for what the resort lacks. Would I go make to this Resort probibly not. It was worth the Florida residents rate we spent of $ 99.00 a night for a water view room. However for about $20.00 more a night I can stay at the Animal Kingdom Lodge deluxe resort for $ 120.00 a night. (big difference). My son had a wonderful time using the mice boats and playing the video games and the piano man and that is all that matters to us. This was our 5th trip to disney this year. We live approx 1hr ffrom disney so we go at least that many times a year. We have stayed at a lot of the resorts. It is a plus to stay on disney property with free transportation and all the resorts are themed which is super neat.

After reading some of these reviews, I have to laugh. Of course there are bugs in Florida! Disney can't change that for you. And of course there is standing water. It rains in Florida almost daily at certain times of the year. Disney can't do a thing about that, either. We've stayed at Port Orleans a few times. It has always been quite satisfactory to us. Clean, efficient. Food at the courts a little pricy, but you're on vacation. You can't expect McDonald's prices at any resort that I know of. If you don't like paying the high prices, consider a cooler and a local grocery store for kids' milk, etc. All in all, any Disney resort is a great place to stay.

The kids 3 and 4 loved the main pool and the \"quiet pool\" that was near our \"mansion\". The grounds were nice, food court was ok, we really did not eat there except for one lunch. The rooms were ok, nothing special but clean and maid service was good. I can see why they are next on the list to be refurbished, the furniture could use updating. The mattresses and pillows were also comfortable. Of course the best thing about the Disney resort is unlimited access to the parks.

We were on the bottom floor and could hear the people above us using the bathroom, one word for that...gross. The grounds and pool are wonderful, we enjoy taking the boat to DTD.

We had a great time, weather cooporated, only rained one day & that was while we were inside so it didn't matter. We have stayed at the PO before, but the section we stayed was closed for renovations. When we checked in my daughter asked for Building #14 which was close to the pool, food court & to the bus pick-up. The rooms were okay, but the lighting in the bathroom was very dim. We had plenty of supplies & since there was no hair dryer on the wall I just called down to the desk & they sent one up for me to use for the week. The bus service was for the most part good - the only problem was getting around at night when the theme parks were closed. The only park that stayed open later was Epot & that was because of the fireworks & laser show. The food court was also okay & we didn't find that food was that expensive - we did buy the mugs though which was a very good investment. I understand that shortly the PO Riverside is going to be closed for rennovations which probably is a good idea. Even though our rooms were okay they could use a little freshening up.

Very nice scenery! We were a bit confused when we first got there, but we soon learned how to get around! It was a very fun and clean resort! The pools were great and of course the Cast Members were too! And let me tell you, I met some of the nicest and friendliest people ever at that resort! It is so magical there! The food court's food was GREAT! The lines weren't too bad either- they moved very quickly! This is a very family-friendly resort!

We were not impressed with the rooms at all. All of the rooms are in several different buildings spread out all over the area. The rooms itself were about the same size as other hotels in the area. The rooms all have 2 double beds, a table with 2 chairs and a dresser. The room had painted walls with a border around top, and cheap carpeting, nothing special for the money you pay. We were on the ground level and had problems with many small red fire ants, despite their sending the exterminators to our room to spray. The grounds were quite pretty, but we were too tired after a long day to go for a walk. The swimming pool is quite large and nice (open 24 hrs), but far away from many rooms. The check-in lodge with the restaurants is a bit of a distance from most of the rooms. There is a fast food court in the main lodge. The food court prices were reasonable but they are terribly under staffed. Everyone stood in long lines to get waited on to get food (most people we talked to said it is like that all day long). You can take a boat ride to downtown disney. This boat ride is quite nice and a pretty view. The lines for the boat ride back to the hotel are long at night, so we took the bus back. The maid we had was the best part of being there, she was wonderful. Driving around the area was terrible, the signs are not marked well and we missed our turn several times (Follow the signs to downtown disney, then watch for the hotel sign). All in all, I would not go there again. It was not worth the extra money we paid. We had stayed at nicer hotels off the disney property for less money.", "Date": "October 1, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cDisneyland Lover loves Port Orleans!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1347746", "Content": "We had an absolute great time at the PO Riverside. First, I was wary about the bus system, I could see my wife and I waiting in the blistering Florida humidity for a bus. DID NOT HAPPEN ONCE! We did not wait for a bus for more than ten minutes the entire time. The transit system was great. We took the waterway once, just to do it, then we took the bus from there on. The buses were way to convenient not to. Now the hotel, every day we left, we came back to the room being clean and even the towels were folded all cute and stuff. The grounds were well kept and the pool was very nice. On our way back to our room once we saw a cool looking toad, just hangin around staring right back at us. The brown water was a little ugly, but it comes from the trees that keep the mosquitoes out, so I'll take the brown/black water and no mosquitoes. The gift shop was well stocked and it seemed that every time we got off at the main bus stop, we would end up going through there just to grab something fast. The food at the food court was really good, and the service was really nice making special pizza's for my no-cheese liking self. It was a little expensive, but not that much than the All Star's and it seemed that a lit of people were at the All Star's and I heard that All Star's are always loud and noisy and busy. If you like it quiet, with nice rooms and service with a smile(from everyone!) stay here. All in all, it was a great place to stay and I would stay there again without hesitation.

I wanted to share with everyone who is maybe planning a trip to Disney and wanting to stay at this resort. It is okay, totally not worth the money. We visit Disney once a year, and we choose one park per year and we normally stay at the All Star Resort. We wanted to try something alittle bit more expensive thinking we would get more. We were totally wrong and pretty unhappy with our decision. We almost checked out after seeing the rooms. Dirty is a good word, but just OLD. These rooms do have a rustic flair to them, but it was soo dark in the room I had a heck of a time with even seeing to put my makeup on. The rug in the floor was so dirty my son and daughters socks were black just after having a bath. The grounds of the resort were very well kept, but there is lots of standing brown water in the streams, and lots of bugs out after dusk. I know that Florida is known for bugs, but the standing water everywhere made it worse. The eating cafeteria was nice. The food was really expensive! 2 8 oz. bottles of milk for my son and daughter was over 5.00 dollars. I thought wow, they are expensive here. But have to admit we did eat there a couple of times just out of convenience of having it right there in walking distance. As you walk to the cafeteria, watch out for the ducks. Tons of ducks live right there on the walkway. Sort of hard to keep a 18 month old away from them but these ducks are VERY bold. They are not afraid of anyone walking by, so that sort of put a damper on walking to the cafeteria, so we would kid that get ready for attack of the ducks!! To be honest with you all, next year we are staying outside of the disney property on International Drive. There is a ton of places to walk to and it is really great area with lots of cheaper hotels that look really really nice! Have a GREAT trip where ever you stay!
