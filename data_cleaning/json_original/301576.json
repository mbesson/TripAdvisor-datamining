Pleased to report that several years later they look just as good and provide the same quality of service as they did on day one. The location is great, just a short stroll across the road to the dockside and an abras station for a speedy transit across the Creek. There's parking right outside the main entrance and plenty of landmark hotels in the very near viscinity so you won't get lost or suffer from direction fatigue with taxis who appropriately get confused if you just mention 'Le Meridien'. There are at least six (last count) Le Meridien's in Dubai and the Residence Deira isn't one of them. So if you're making your own way from the airport ensure you have the address written down and rehearse your Arabic dialect in arrivals. The apartments are all spotless and spacious with decent catering facilities and bathrooms. Beds are comfortable and there's no problem with noise. The views are not what you stay here for - they aren't great - but there's too much to do right outside the door (souks-a-plenty, shopping, strolling by the Creek, visiting merchants houses etc.) to spend time gazing at the lack of view. If you prefer the Creek to the beach then this is an ideal spot, and if you prefer the beach but don't want beach accommodation prices then this is close enough to provide an economical way of experiencing both.", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWould most definitely return here!

I normally try to eat at local restaurants as opposed to eating at a hotel chain, but the restaurant was highly recommended by my travel book and other tourists. It was definitely a feast fit for a queen (me), and the live music and locals made it a special experience. The Meridien front desk agents were very efficient and helped me with all of my tourist like questions and directions. There was a computer in the lobby for guest use with a fee.

I compared different locations. We wanted a Hotel Apartment with a usable kitchenette. This hotel served both purposes. One can feel slightly uncomfortable being in downtown Deira since it is congested and crowded with mostly daily wage workers in Dubai. This hotel though in Deira has a reasonable distance from Deira downtown. Union Metro station is just a few minutes walk away. There are plenty of shops around for groceries and other needs. Our Studio apartment had a very nice Kitchenette and one of the MOST comfortable mattresses that i have ever slept on. Kitchen stove is very very usable and provide adequate and quick heat. Bath room is pretty spacious and never seem to run out of hot water even without the hot water heater. And trust me i have seen 5 star hotels run out of hot water in 20 minutes. Toilet flush is smooth and wont splash you :-) AC & Heating in the room is very good as well. If you do not need Amenities such as pool, fitness center and so on then go for it. I wish they would plan to provide internet to the guests in the room in the near future. If you look around you can find an internet cafe but off course it is not as comfortable as using the Net from your own room. Dubai creek is also at a walking distance. One can take a pleasant and somewhat scenic walk along the creek and also enjoy fresh juices from the cafe along the road. Hotel is not noisy and you always have this sense of privacy even in the small lobby as you step outside the hotel.

I was planning on visiting the Dubai Mall so this wasn't the best location for that but I was right next to the metro and bus station.

It faces a busy street and the most popular option on every vehicle is the horn. I chose to embrace the sounds of the local area and ignore it. Other rooms not facing the street may be better.

Very convenient, close to abra station/Big Bus Company bus stop. To tell you the truth, I prefer Studio to 1 bed room. Every room is kind of equipped slightly different. The first room (1BR 900dirham per night) I stayed comes with horrible sofa; not new at all, uncomfortable to sit and shabby. It is far from Le Meridien image. I really admit that it is time to be replaced. However, studio rooms (800dirham per night) I stayed for other nights are much better. Thick and new curtain, comfy sofa, plentiful kitchen tools.

Also Post Office behind this accomodation ;-D <What I didn't have was> Breakfast ( no restauran here, even cafe), Tour arrangement. <How to Get there> As of Jan 2010, not every Dubai Metro Station is in operation yet. Fortunately, Union Station is in operation already and Residence DEIRA is just next to it. If you take Dubai METRO, take EXIT1 (not, EXIT2) at Union Station. Once you reach up to the ground level, you will see fountain square just in front, which is called Union Square. You will see about 7-storey-old-white-building beyond the fountain. The building is not outstanding, but sign of 'TITAN WATCHES' really is, it is on the top of the building, you won't miss it. Residence DEIRA is in the building, but you have to walk around to find to the entrance, it is on the other side from METRO. It is only 3 minutes walking from the Union Station. If cabbies don't know Residence DEIRA, just mention Union Station, every cabbie knows Union Station. By the way, Dubai Metro is not in oreration before 14 on every Friday. Please also remember that TITAN WATCHES sign won't be lit up after certain time at night. <Where to eat nearby> There is Radisson BLU across the main street. You will find several restaurants in the arcade that belongs to Radisson BLU. There is a small food court in Twin Tower. Even if you don't eat there, it is nice view from the teracce seats in Twin Tower. In case you want to try local restaurants, go to EXIT2 direction. There are many local restaurants including a McDonald's. If you want to buy only drink, go to gas station in front. 5-10 minutes walking takes you to 24 hour supermarket, JEFCO. <Internet> Unfortunately, you can't use your computer in rooms, but there is a computer for any guests at lobby. Charged on per minute. <Express Bus> There is a bus depot just between the Metro Station and Residence DEIRA. I didn't check the exact details, but most likely, bound for Sharjah. <TIP> Book this accomodation through hotel.com something like that, you can get super great deal. Residence DEIRA by Le Meridien is one of serviced apartments, definitely not hotel.

The front entrance of the hotel is not visible until after you turn off Al Maktoum Road. From Al Maktoum Road, what you can use as placemarks are the Orlando Sports and the Bank Saderat Iran. Service was friendly and helpful. Since I had a prepaid Travelocity reservation, I did not need to present my credit card at check-in. I snagged a great deal on the studio room with two single beds, but since I was traveling alone, the person at check-in offered to send someone up to join the two single beds and put a full-sized sheet over them. There was no welcome fruit basket though. The room was spacious and clean. The apartment-like amenities such as the kitchen (with refrigerator and oven), cutlery and flatware really came in handy during Ramadan, as most restaurants are closed during the day, and you are not supposed to eat or drink in public during daylight. I was able to purchase groceries from the nearby 24-hour grocery store mentioned by other reviewers (Choithram) and prepare my own meals. Unlike another reviewer\u2019s experience, my room did have a kettle. The central AC was very powerful, as I didn\u2019t use the room AC at all even though it was stiflingly hot outside in the Dubai summer. Location-wise, the hotel is in a convenient location. I walked everywhere throughout my trip, and didn\u2019t need to take a cab. The newly opened Union Square Dubai Metro station is right next to the hotel, and there are plenty of shops within walking distance. I arrived just a few days after the Metro opening, and fortunately, the Union Square station was one of the ten stations that were ready for the launch date. The Dubai Creek is also nearby, from where I took the hour-long Guided Creek Tour (recommended) and then boarded an abra to cross the Creek. Overall, I would stay here again. The biggest advantages for me are the kitchen + grocery store, and the Metro station next door.

As other reviewers have mentioned, some taxi drivers including mine, didn't know where it was, but they were more than happy to find it for you. Al Maktoum Rd / 15th, behind the Radisson near the petrol station will get you there. It's a white building but there is no clear sign. My taxi driver was extremely helpful, called the hotel. It should be no more than 20 minutes by taxi. I have stayed at Le Meridiens in the past, including high end ones, and the reception area at this one looked very dated and old. This got me worried that I was not really at the right place, but it is correct. Nonetheless, the service at check-in was excellent. A special thank you to Dinesh at reception for being so kind, polite, helpful and efficient with the check-in process. The rooms are actually apartment style suites. They are big. There is a large fully-fitted kitchen area in addition to the sleeping area plus a sofa, with useful desks. Staying the one night, there really wasnt any need for the kitchen, but if you are considering an extended stay it would be very useful. The bathroom was nice and clean and the bath deep. Note that you need to switch on the hot water switch to get hot water which is located outside the bathroom door. They provide high quality toiletries and sofas. The bed itself was one of the comfiest I have ever slept on, albeit a little short, but wide. I should say that the room was very well temperature controlled. Though there is individually controlled air con, which worked fine, I was most comfortable with it switched off, which was suprising considering how hot it was outside. The only issues I would report are that the door chain was broken, and the TV channels were too fuzzy to watch. Also I got woken up at 2am by a loud bell outside my room - which I presume was a fire alarm that may have been mistakenly set off. Thought it was about a second, it was enough to wake me. Check-out was very simple. Simply handed the door card to the lady downstairs, who then called a taxi over for me. I got a great rate direct with Starwood.

Cab drivers' knowledge of the location of this hotel varies. The airport cab driver had to call to obtain directions (keep the phone number handy; telling the driver that it is located at Al Makhtoum & 15th, behind the Radisson, right across from the gas/petrol station may be helpful). Once he had the directions, it was a quick ride over. Some other cab drivers were well aware of the location, while one got mad at me for not knowing being able to give him precise directions to the hotel (I vacated the cab pretty much immediately, and took another cab). Check-in was easy (I had pre-paid on Expedia), and a credit card was not required for any incidentals. I had a corner studio room with wall windows on 2 sides -- this really made the room look very spacious. The room did not have an iron or ironing board, but the hotel can arrange to have your clothes pressed, if needed. Some reviewers noted that there was fresh fruit in the room and daily newspapers. However, I did not experience this. The room did contain 2 complimentary bottles of water, which were not replenished. At the same time, I never bothered to ask about any of this because my stay was extremely short (2 nights, including the night I landed), and I just didn't have the time or energy to raise the issue. The bed was comfortable, as were the pillows (a pet peeve). The room was clean, as was the bathroom. The bathroom is of average size. The bathroom used white-CFL lighting, which I'm not a fan of, but it wasn't bad enough to bother me. The power-point in the bathroom accommodated my 110v cell-phone charger, and appeared sufficient for a hair dryer, etc. The climate control is old school, so don't expect to be able to set a particular temperature. The hotel is in a fantastic location. Deira creek is a 5 minute walk, and the dhows (boats that can be used to cross the creek are 10 minutes away and cost 1Dhs). The textile souk is across the creek, while the gold souk is on the same side as the hotel -- it is a vigorous 20 minute walk away. The front desk staff were extremely helpful, and organized for a local cab for my ride to the airport. The cab arrived ahead of time, and checkout was as simple as dropping off my keycard. Overall, this is a very nice hotel in a fantastic location. I would certainly return to this hotel if I found myself back in Dubai. On a separate note, cabs were fairly easy to find. The front desk can call one for you, or if you find yourself walking around on a fairly busy street and need a cab, just stand around for a few minutes (be patient), and keep an eye out for a cab with the \"taxi\" sign light up; step out, raise your hand, and the cab will cut across all traffic, and come to you!

I thought that having an apartment would be a nice closing to our vacation. What a wonderful choice for us! We were completing a vacation which had started in San Francisco, continued in Singapore with overnights there prior to a repositioning cruise from Singapore to Dubai -- even a deluxe shore excursion to the Taj Mahal, and then this planned 3-night stay in Dubai. We arrived somewhat travel-weary, but the drive through Dubai had been a real eye-opener! We were ready once again to take on the trials of sightseeing in a city that has wowed us for some time. It was only 11:30 am and the hotel posted check-in at 3:00 pm. To our delight we were permitted to check-in early and we were given a deluxe room with a rather attractive view. The room was large--very large: bedroom, living room, dining room, kitchen and 1.5 baths including a bidet! The suite was sparkling clean, delightfully cool and welcoming in every way. How nice to have a full refrigerator to cool drinks and a kitchen to prepare breakfast! This truly set the tone for our stay. We had wondered if the desk would be adequately covered during the night and if there would even be a concierge. We were delighted with the reception services. They were quite adequate. Taxi drivers seemed unfamiliar with the hotel, so it was wise to get the card from the desk which gave directions/location to have in hand when using a taxi. We found the staff exceptional. They helped us in any way we asked. All toiletries were restocked daily and we were given extra towels for the kitchen. We were given a bowl of fresh fruit the first day of our 3-night stay and offered the opportunity to enjoy the resort services and transportation available to the Le Meridien at the beach. We did not take this offer during our all-too-brief stay. This is clearly a three-star hotel; do not build up your expectations associated with Le Meridien status. This is a clean, cozy, charming place to stay. It shows some wear. On the other hand, it's an apartment style living where you can truly relax; it's delightfully close to the abra station, to the Dhow River Cruise boats, and especially the Gold Souk. We walked \"home\" easily from the Gold Souk, but getting there was a bit of a challenge. A stay in Dubai is a marvel in itself. We took the hop on/off bus and found it a great way to get around though we had done our best sightseeing with a personal guide from the Carlton Hotel which is very nearby. This hotel is a good one.

I booked a very good (for Dubai) rate on Expedia for $71 US but I was unfamiliar with Dubai and worried about two things: being a solo female traveler and the location of this hotel. I needed to do some work for a few days in various parts of Dubai, then go sightseeing and scuba diving for the rest of the week out of town but using Dubai as my base. Turns out that if you are sensibly dressed in public and take advantage of the 'ladies seating' in buses and restaurants, you will feel at ease. However, even without these special women-only zones, I never felt uncomfortable or threatened at all and I used the public buses all the time. Taxis, while cheap, still added up because you pay to sit in traffic much of the time. By learning a few main bus lines, I actually got around just as well for a fraction of the price (yes, there is a good public transport system, complete with air conditioned bus stops!). The Deira area, where the hotel is located, is close to the Dubai airport, so my arrival in the middle of the night did not require a long taxi ride. There is a public bus but I had too much luggage. About the location: turns out with the sprawl of Dubai, the construction detours and overall traffic congestion, unless you absolutely need to be on a beach, I think Deira is just fine. I love to stroll around a city, but Dubai is too hot and too spread out to make it enjoyable, even though this hotel is located within walking distance to several sights. The checkin was quick and I was not asked to leave a credit card deposit, as I noticed happened with several other guests during my stay. I remember reading other reviews of Dubai hotels which mentioned this 'deposit'. Perhaps because I prepaid with Expedia they didn't require one from me? This hotel is also one block from Dubai Creek, where you can watch the dhows, a longish walk to the Gold Souk and Spice Souks, and although their Internet was expensive, I used one of two Internet cafes within 5 minutes walk. The Radisson SAS hotel is across the street and I used it as a landmark for taxi drivers to take me to my hotel. The room is a spacious, clean studio with full kitchen and large bathroom. I received a newspaper, free, each day and really appreciated the bowl of fruit and bottled water upon arrival. I loved the fact that I had lots of cold drinks waiting for me at the end of each day in my refrigerator, LOL. In addition, although I only used it one day, staying here allows you to use the pool and other facilities at the Le Meridien Dubai, their flagship hotel next to the airport. They even have a shuttle that goes between these two hotels twice a day. I had some business to do, and found that messages were taken and given to me promptly, wakeup calls were done on time (and taxi's called while I got ready to go out), and the front desk even verified each night if I needed a wakeup call, taxi or anything else for the following morning. Even if I didn't, I appreciated the fact that they were proactive about arranging anything for me. Overall, the staff put me at ease, met my needs, the room was an oasis, literally, in a hot place, and I was close enough to do some walking to some major sights.

It would come out to be about the same because of having to take taxis to the main areas in Dubai.", "Date": "January 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNot bad for the money\u201d", "Author": "choybie", "ReviewID": "UR23304561", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in October and had a nice stay. We arrived very early in the morning and our room wasnt available yet, but the staff did all they could to get us into a room as soon as possible. Our room was huge and extremely quiet, despite being on the main road. Liked the fresh fruit, having a kitchen and having room cleaned daily. The staff were very friendly. Considering how expensive accomodation is in Dubai, we felt that the Le Meridien Residence was good value for the money. Biggest issue was the transport. Whilst the staff are happy to try and get you a taxi, one will not turn up during peak hours! So definately make use of the Radisson SAS hotel across the road where taxis seem to stop more often.", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Le Meridien Residence Deira", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d301576-Reviews-Le_Meridien_Residence_Deira-Dubai.html", "Price": "$109*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Al maktoum Road and 15th st</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "301576", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d3/c1/d3c11523f468bcf93d6730e102e1ebbf1large.jpg"}}
