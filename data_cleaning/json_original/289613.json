The first room given to us was rather gloomy and painted a sad shade of orange, moreover the AC wasn't effective in the heat of June. On the two other occasions, we had a much nicer pleasanter room with a spacious bath and a good AC . Unlike in other places, the third bed was in a different room of the suite, which made it much more spacious. The staff were friendly and helpful, the location is within half a kilometre of Plaza Sol and the Prado, with a lot of choices of good eating places around. The cost was much lower than what we paid for equivalent accomodation in Rome, Barcelona or Florence. The building and the reception area were not in the best of shape, but the room and the location more than made up for that. Wi Fi was free and fast, which was a great help.", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid", "Title": "\u201cmadrid with friends\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR132876624", "Content": "Large rooms but old style.

May be it was because we went with very low expectations. The good part of this hotel: 1.It\u2019s located in the middle of all tourist attractions \u2013 Sol, Museum, Plaza Mayor, Palace \u2013 all are in walking distance. 2.The reception is always staffed ( 24 hours) . They all speak English and are very helpful. 3.Rooms are of decent size, we had three beds in the room and lots of space for our luggage and to move around. 4.We arrived at 8 AM, our room was ready and we could check in immediately. 5.The room was clean, serviced everyday, bathrooms had basic toiletries if one needed them. 6.There is a vending machine in the lobby where you can get your drinks at normal prices ( which is a rarity in the tourist areas of Madrid) 7.Hassle free air-conditioning which is a rare find even in 3* hotels in Spain. 8.Free internet broadband with very strong signal and it allowed us to log on more than one device at the same time from the room 9.The place is safe and security monitored. Not so nice parts: 1.Our bathroom had an issue with ants, they were swarming all over. 2.The TV was miniscule and I don\u2019t remember seeing any English Channels, but the internet worked great, I logged on to youtube, etc for everything. Verdict- This is not a five star or even a four star and they don\u2019t claim it to be. What they provide is a safe, clean, convenient place to board. We were happy with Aguilar. It didn\u2019t burn a hole in our pockets and met all our needs and more.

There were several hostals in same building and this was the one that happened to have a spare room. They told us right away, that it will be double beds, and of course at 2 at night we didn't wan't to be very choosy :D. The room was very nice and big, clean bathroom, air-conditioning. The bathtub looked very old though, with broken enamel. But honestly, it didn't bother at all - the shower worked perfectly, and it was clean. TV and a small sofa, though the room's planning makes them useless - its impossible to lay on a bed and watch TV. The housekeeping stuff is very nice - even if we left the room at 14, we would find our beds made and towels changed. I left them some cents on the bed first day, and when we came back, my coins were carefully folded on a bedside table. The room had a very nice shutters, so it was dark in the room as it was night even in the afternoon - my boyfriend loved it, as he just cannot sleep with ANY light, and we were coming back home at 5 - 7 am. No any noise, only maybe from around 10am some moving out people. But no noise made it to the room from the street, which was very nice. Very nice surprise was a free wifi! There was no breakfast in the hotel, but we found a great deal from cafe Rodilla just on Puerta del Sol - 3 euro for coffee and hot sandwich + fresh orange juice for just 1 euro.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lisbon, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, Great price\u201d", "Author": "MartaGaspar", "ReviewID": "UR115292102", "Content": "I booked this hostal after readinh the reviews on tripadvisor.

San Jeronimo. A great location, it is the perfect place to stay for people on budgets. It's really easy to get around the city, either by walking or using the subway(Sol & Sevilla are the closest metro stops). There are shops and restaurants close by, and people constantly walking around. It is a safe and well lit neighborhood, even at 1AM. If you can't find what you need on San Jeronimo, El Sol is two blocks away and has everything you could want. The hotel itself is quite dark and spartan. It is much like a college dorm room, with plush couches in the main hall and brown speckled floors or linoleum tiles in the hallways and rooms. The beds are so uncomfortable and very basic. My sheets didn't even extend all the way to the end of my bed. The bathroom is exceptionally clean and was my favorite part about the hotel. Hemingway stayed here in room 107(I believe that is the number....it is the room straight across from the reception desk), which is a fun factoid and consoles you amidst the bleakness of the decor. The staff is very friendly and helpful about Madrid and the local area...and there is a lockout of the main door after 11, so ring up to the front desk if those glass doors are shut. It's a great safety precaution and definitely made me feel more safe. It made me depressed to stay in such a dark place, but it has its redeeming qualities. If you can deal with the dimly lit rooms and hallways and the spartan decor, this is a great deal for travelers in Madrid.", "Date": "September 3, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hostal Aguilar", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d289613-Reviews-Hostal_Aguilar-Madrid.html", "Price": "$54 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">c/ Carrera de San Jeronimo, n0 32 , 20</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28014 </span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "289613", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/67/e2/67e27c48fa16f61d658c62bd0fb68be81large.jpg"}}
