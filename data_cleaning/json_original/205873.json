Now, the price per night is very high, but in Rome center, all the hotels are very expensive.Is a small hotel distributed between the second and fourth floor of an elegant old building. The areas are well cared for and decorated, but everything very small. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast room is very small, has 16 seats, many people accumulate at 8.30 for breakfast. Breakfast is simple, a continental breakfast with very good expresso and capuccino, toasts, bread with jam and marmelade, some pastries and a few kelloggs. That's all, no ham, no salads, no sandwiches. Girls serving on breakfast room are very gentle and friendly. Rooms are little, so small that you hardly pass between the wall and your bedside, but well mantained and decorated. Bathroom are completely news but the shower is so narrow that yoy hardly go in and out. Anyway, having stayed other times in Rome, I would stay here again. For the situation, is only five minuts walking from Termini Station, Santa Maria Maggiore and close to Piazza Republica. Touristic Busses start their toute on the opposite side of Piazza Republica, so for a touristic trip is a very well situated hotel. Short walking to Quattro Fontane, Fontana dei Tritone and maybe 15 minutes walking from Fontana Di Trevi. Buses number 64 and 40 stops on the corner with Via Nazionale, and they take you to the Vatican, also close to Piazza Navona...

Great staff, perfect location, pleasant accommodations.\u201d", "Author": "ComeDuermaViaja", "ReviewID": "UR119172199", "Content": "We loved our stay in this hotel. My husband and I have travelled a lot throughout Europe, and I was thrilled with Le Petit! Staff was fantastic, location was perfect. For this trip I was travelling with my 75-year-old mother, so convenience of transportation was important (and taxis in Rome are much more expensive than in, say, Madrid). The metro is a block away and on the red line, which hits more of the main tourists sites than the blue, and there are easy buses along Via Nazionale (right around the corner) to get to main sites. The staff was incredibly helpful in explaining the transportation and making excellent, non-touristy restaurant recommendations. My mother and I were both so happy with this hotel, that I feel the need to address some of the other reviewers' comments. Rooms were very clean, towels were changed every day (despite my request--in my halting Italian, so it's probably my fault--that neither towels nor sheets be changed every single day, as it seems a waste to me). Maybe it's because I live in the western U.S. where water is an issue, but I've stayed in very nice hotels from Chicago to Madrid that have signs about guests' option not to change towels and sheets every day as an environmental question, so I just don't think it's a big deal. Yes, of course, the rooms (and the shower) aren't very big; it's a European hotel in an older, gorgeous central part of an old European city, so I'm not sure what the other reviewers were expecting. Of course, the hotel was not cheap, but again it's Rome, so it's all relative. There's a lot of walking to do in Rome to start with, so a great location is important and worth a little extra to me. We loved this little hotel, and we will absolutely stay there again next time we are in Rome!", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mountain View, California", "Title": "\u201cLe Petit - indeed but the staff was AWESOME!\u201d", "Author": "Syrah35", "ReviewID": "UR118705510", "Content": "I stayed here recently (Sept 23-26, 2011) and was pleasantly surprised. I was already anticipating the worst after reading the reviews. This was my last leg of Europe travel (Paris, main Greece island, Rome) and I was already tired and a little jaded. I have to say this has been probably the 2nd favorite hotel I stayed at during my travels. That said a lot since I've stayed at various main hotel chains while in Greece because I traveled with a tour group. This review is based on a single occupancy room. Why do I like this hotel more than any other that I stayed at during this travel? Well, my overall experience was great! Staff was super awesome! Just my experience with the check in, the front desk person immediately gave me the lowdown on how to get around Rome, even recommended places to visit (which were ALL great, thank you!). My favorite was this older guy, super friendly. I was a little weirded out that it was only on the fourth floor and the office was located on the 2nd which shared with other businesses and residence. When I got to my room, I was pleasantly surprised! It was clean and had everything I needed. Mind you, it was super tiny and the bed isn't super soft (but for me, it was comfy and clean)! Maybe for most Americans, this would be about a 1/4-half the size of room you'd get in a typical hotel chain in the States and you'd have a single bed. However, it was clean, the water runs great (this should be a given, but I've stayed at some were the showers were either positioned weirdly, or water was not so good and there's something not working in the room), free wifi in the lobby (typical in most EU), and the air condition worked - which is a hit or miss in from my experience! :) They cleaned my room everyday, but I asked them not to do this since I don't need it cleaned everyday and just save water/time for their staff. The location was perfect, I practically walked everywhere, and very close to the bus, metro, train station and those open tour buses. If you're super particular and picky about hotels, this might be a 'bad hotel' for you. The breakfast was blah - but all I need is coffee, really, and they make it for you for free! There are some weird things like leaving your hotel key while you're out at the front desk - but I like this since I don't have to worry about losing it, plus it's good for my safety since I traveled alone. However, if you just want a comfortable room with great helpful staff and you're on a budget during your travel, I highly recommend this hotel. It's also on the 'noisier' side but if you've stayed at any major city hotels, this won't be a surprise. Overall, I recommend this hotel to anyone traveling on a BUDGET and don't mind a small room... but have a great staff!", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "KSA", "Title": "\u201cAverage hotel very very standard, nothing GOOD OR BAD\u201d", "Author": "Tamim00", "ReviewID": "UR118209880", "Content": "The hotel: very standard nothing good or bad is noticeable.

Not that they solved my problems, they were just friendly. Also, the central location combined with poor sound isolation means lots of annoying sounds in the middle of the night. Bring your earplugs with you!! And yes, this is still the good part! The negative sides of my experience evolve around the hygiene and service factors, which I believe are central to any hotel. Throughout my one week stay, the room was dusty and alarmed my allergies to a new level. The irritation continued even after I got rid of the blankets and the bed cover, which were really dusty. When I told the management that I wanted to cancel due to this general lack of hygiene, I was rejected with the excuse that a three day notice was necessary. I would expect them to try to solve this inconvenience, instead of making it a bigger issue for me. Moreover, the rail system for the showerhead wasn't stable and the showerhead (almost) fell on my head. And that thing is heavy!! When I asked the management to replace it, they first said I didn't have to use the rail system and could hold the showerhead (thanks for the suggestion). When I insisted, they said they will replace it, which never happened, instead they taped it. I don't call this good service. And how much does that rail system cost anyway? 10-15 euros? Come on..

I stayed here with family taking up 2 doubles (408 & 409) and a single room (404), from 30-Dec-07 to 2-Jan-08. Right, a quick run through the pros which are not too many anyway: 1) Reasonably central location: Close to the Colosseum and Roman Forum (take a left from the hotel down Via Nazionale and then take a left down Via De Serpenti) 2) Staff helpful with directions and things to see and ways to get there 3) Special commendation for Gianni at the front desk in the mornings, who fully understood our problems and tried to help us to the fullest. Please note that the person we had the most problems with is not named below in the Reception Staff so as to avoid any personal affront. 4) Plenty of hot water in the shower Cons: I recommend you sit down with a cup of coffee because this is going to be long. 1) Tiny rooms (helpful suggestion from one of the reception staff at the front desk who said \"You should have figured it out from the name Le Petit\"). No room in the room to walk around freely - in fact, the room should be called and advertised as a \"Hole\" and not a \" Room\". 2) Place for only one piece of luggage on the chair/support 3) Tiny shower cubicles - I could not stretch out both my elbows at the same time. Scrubbing my back was out of the question. 4) Breakfast was miniscule and pre-packaged (mostly) compared to the delicious spreads we enjoyed in hotels at Venice and Florence which we visited before Rome. 5) My sister-in-law's family was charged 10 EUR/night extra for my niece's breakfast and use of towels!!!! No extra bed was provided and she had to squeeze into the usual double bed. 6) The shower in room 409 was not draining the first day 7) There was mold/fungus in the shower of room 408 Separate section: 8) Reception staff (this person is neither Gianni nor Vito): This gentleman is priceless. We wanted to check out on the second day due to all the problems above and since desperation had led me to personally check the Best Western Mondial just next door which had better and larger rooms, good breakfast and was charging LESS!!! Hotel Le Petit's rates were more than 15% higher than the Mondial's. Due to the Le Petit's minimum stay policy of 3 days, we could not go scot free (i.e. without paying a penalty) which is perfectly reasonable but they were still asking for a ridiculously high compromise. I tried to reason with the gentleman at the desk who firstly did not understand most of what we were saying. I was reducing to showing exactly how I was having a shower with my arms bent in. I then wrote out a detailed letter to the owner explaining why we wanted to check out and how much we were prepared to pay as a penalty since the receptionist above said \"I cannot disturb the owner with your problems\"!!!! I guess that says enough about his particular attitude to any problems the guests may have. As the hotel was not prepared to come down to the compromise price which we were suggesting, I conveyed to the receptionist that the hotel was basically forcing dissatisfied guests to stay on and there were ways in which we could spread this. One of the main reasons I'm writing this review is because of the man's response produced below (fairly verbatim): \"I don't think anything you say or do will hurt the owner or the hotel\". I have photos of the place which I haven't yet uploaded. I can attach it to this review later or post a separate review on this place to prove the physical discomfort at this place.

It's in a building that it shares with some offices, and the reception desk, along with a few rooms are on the 2nd floor, while most of the rooms and the breakfast area are on the 4th floor. Since you have to give the reception desk your key whenever you leave the hotel, it is a bit of a pain to have to stop at the second floor every time you go out, but that a pretty minor nit-pick. The rooms were small, but that is to be expected in a more reasonable priced hotel in any large city. We stayed at the hotel for the first 3 nights of our Italy vacation, and the last night before we flew out. The staff was very friendly; when we checked out on the last day before we had to head back to the airport, the receptionist was so excited to tell us about someone putting red dye in the Trevi Fountain that he followed us the whole way to the elevator, chatting away. The hotel does not have any internet access, but, given it's odd location, I was able to stand by the window in my room, and get on some open WiFi networks, and send some emails. I've often read that the Termini section of town is not one of the best locations to stay at, but I don't agree. I agree there isn't a whole lot to do right in the neighborhood and I didn't find any good restaurants in the area (all the restaurants in Rome were over-priced and not very good, compared to everywhere else I went in Italy). But it isn't at all seedy or dangerous; it's a very hustle and bustle type area. What I liked best about it, though, was the fact that you have easy access to all types of transportation to the other parts of the city and the rest of the country (the train, metro, buses). When you are in another part of the city, and want to get back to your hotel, it is very easy to find a bus that heads back to that area, because most buses start and stop at Termini (the Metro red and blue lines end there too). Trying to figure out what bus to take and what stop to get off to get to other parts of Rome can be a bit more of a challenge.

We stayed here for four nights between end of August and start of September. We initially found it hard to find a hotel reasonably priced and not compromising too much on room quality and location but chose Le Petit Hotel on recommendations on Trip Advisor. The Hotel reception staff were very welcoming, spoke excellent English and freely gave tourist advice on our check in. In comparison to photos on Trip Advisor it seems that the rooms on the hotels second floor at least have been recently renovated. Air conditioning worked a dream, comfortable bed, Italian digital TV (SKY) with option to listen in English on a selection of channels. The bathroom had a good strong hair dryer, good space around the sink and shower. The room was serviced daily. The hotel is 10 minute walk from Rome main train station, 2 minute walk from Metro and bus stop across the road on Via Nationazle. Take the 64 or 40 to go to Vatican. 15-20 minute walk to Spanish Steps, 25 minute walk to Piazza Venezia and a 25-30 minute walk to the Coloseum and Roman Form. Lovely restaurant around the corner of the hotel and for fellow Irish there are 3 \"Irish\" bars in close proximity to the hotel, the nearest is two minutes down Via Nationazle serving food and the obligatory Guinness, not cheap be expected to pay a premium for the familiar Irish, American and German beer brands, roughly \u20ac 5 - \u20ac5.50 for a pint! My advice is to stick to the local stuff but generally only find this in local restaurants. My only criticism of the hotel is the Breakfast, very small selection. We got Croissant, local bread with cheese, selection of Kellogg\u2019s cereal and some Juice. No cheese or meat selection like all other Continental breakfasts. We skipped breakfast on 3 out of our 4 night stay (breakfast ends at 9.30), my advice would be to call into DeSpar on way down Via National if heading that direction. You can pick up the necessary bottle of water for 50 cent and a wide range of fruit and rolls. Avoid if possible the water and fruit stalls on the street, \u20ac2.50 for a bottle of water - extortion! Le Petit Hotel defiantly exceeded our expectations.

Our children are 4, 6 and 10. We stayed in 2 rooms (407 and 408) a triple and a double. I actually chose this hotel by reading other users' feedback on trip advisor and they have been very accurate. Good stuff about this hotel: The guy on reception was VERY helpful when we arrived and showed us the best buses to get, Metro etc and his English was excellent. The accommodation (beds and bathrooms) were clean and tidy which is what is really important. Both rooms were serviced daily and there were plenty of clean towels and hot water for showers. The hotel is literally a 2 minute walk from the nearest Metro and bus stops which made getting around VERY easy and cheap. You can buy tickets from the news stall just on the Piazza Del Republicca for 4 Euro per 'adult' (Child over10) and roam the public transport system with these tickets all day! WATCH OUT for pick pockets on crowded buses though...we lost our wallet/cards/money on a bus on the way back from Piazza Barberini on the Saturday night and they (buses!) are notorious for this problem we found out later! The hotel is good value for money overall (in the context of Roman hotels!) Could do better stuff with this hotel...... Could have done with tea/coffee making facilities or a bar available within the hotel. (there is a mini bar in the room but we didn't use it at all)....There is a snack shop beside the hotel but they aren't equipped for drinks on the go so had to pour my cappuccino into a previously emptied orange juice bottle so I could take it back to my room because the kids were asleep! (With husband...I didn't leave them alone!!!) If you are at the hotel, there is no seating/communal area so it is your room or bust.....we found that a bit challenging with 3 children and small spaces so had to go out to keep them occupied. Normally, there would be a bar we could gat a coffee and a Coke for the kids and we could relax whilst they chatted/played with Gameboys etc without having to be in our rooms. It is rather noisy all the time as there is a busy one way street outside the hotel.

I am a female, single traveller from Australia, aged 51. I stayed in a single room for two nights and a double room for five nights. The shower in the single room was tiny (and only slightly larger in the double room) but what should one expect from a hotel named Le Petit in Europe, where most rooms in budget accommodation are very small. Yes, the lobby is on the 2nd floor and the rooms up on the 4th, but this is not a problem. There is a small elevator big enough for one person and your luggage and there is a security door at the front of the building, so you just buzz to get in at any time. Other tenants in the building are mostly professionals -- doctors etc -- so there is no reason for alarm about sharing the building. Wi-fi access is avaiilable on the 2nd floor lobby if you plan to take your own notebook. There are two internet cafes around the corner (make sure you take some ID with you: the government requires that internet operators request it from you). The hotel is tastefully decorated in a modern Roman style (beautifully sponged walls -- each room in a different colour) with plain bedspreads, and a little bar fridge in your room is stocked with drinks and snacks at fairly reasonable prices. The rooms are cleaned daily and the beds made with fresh sheets. Fresh towels are also supplied daily and there is a hair dryer in the bathroom. Because the building is solid stone, it doesn't require much heating or cooling and I found the temperature in the room to be perfect most of the time (like the weather in Rome -- a beautiful 20 degrees C and sunny during the week I was there). You can even open and close the windows to regulate the music of the traffic below, as required. The location of the hotel is quite perfect, near the Termini Stazione, but also within walking distance from all the major landmarks (the Colosseum etc) and cultural attractions (the Opera House is around the corner). There are plenty of shops and restaurants and a few trattoria nearby, as well as two supermarkets around the corner. Most of the hotel staff speak English to a medium level (and one is learning French!) so they can direct you to all attractions and major tour operators with the aid of a simple map which they will supply. I can see why some people might find the walk from the station with luggage a little strenuous. Roman streets are small and very busy by world standards, so rather than dragging your luggage through and around obstacles, I would suggest the easiest way to get from the airport would be to catch a shuttle bus. You can pick one up from the airport by paying at the info desk upon arrival, or book in advance as I did over the internet(using viator.com) also paying in your own national currency. What more can you want from a budget hotel in Rome, apart from quite a generous continental breakfast, which includes as as many freshly made cups of coffee (including capuccino) or tea, as required? This is prepared by warm, friendly staff (all of whom who are happy to have a chat with you ,if you feel like it, just to improve their English). No old dripolators or percolators overbrewing in this place! In true Italian style, you get the real thing. There is a Nescafe instant sachet to be found anywhere in this place. On the mornings that I needed to leave before breakfast was scheduled to be served, they insisted I take a croissant or two with me to eat on the run. I found this quite helpful, given I had to leave the hotel at 7am for my all day trip to Pompeii, where the first food stop from the bus was at 10am). Overall, I found this to be a lovely little hotel that was good value for money in an otherwise rather expensive city (especially if you're exchanging Australian dollars for spending there!). I would not hesitate to stay at Le Petit again. My only advice is to be aware that the beds are very hard (well, in the past Romans have been known to sleep on concrete) and the pillows are very flimsy(but they will give you extra pillows when you ask for them). These are honest, hard-working proprietors and staff. Give them a fair go and you'll reap much in return. They are very good humoured and will teach you some key Italian words and phrases, while always trying their best to please you with a smile.", "Date": "January 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "brighton, uk", "Title": "\u201cA Let Down\u201d", "Author": "californiainuk", "ReviewID": "UR6185962", "Content": "Read the other reviews and booked via airmiles so got a deal for \u00a350.

The terrace was nice, with two large chairs and a table (wicker). We had the lowest terrace, which isn't the prettiest but appears to be the biggest. The room had high ceilings, was clean and well decorated (I'd describe it was a masculine Italian look) and the staff could not have been friendlier. There was no language problem; everyone had a heavy Italian accent, of course, but spoke & understood English. The location of the hotel was also a plus. You are literately around the corner from the Repubblica Metro station - a minute walk, TOPS.

We always felt completely safe walking back to the hotel at night. The room we had (207) was fully updated and very nice but very small. We had 2 twin beds and a fold out ottoman for my son. The beds were lined up within a foot of each other making it quite cramped. However, we were only in the room to sleep so it made no difference. It would have been fine as a double. As a triple it was a little small. My son complained about the fold-out ottoman hurting his back as there was a bar right in the middle. He did seem to be in some pain from sleeping on this thing - and usually teenagers can sleep anywhere quite comfortably. Also, the shower was tiny. An obese person would find it almost impossible to enter into and use this shower. The stairs and hallways of the building are being renovated but it didn't affect the quality of our stay. On the minus side, the hotel seemed quite noisy. There was the usual 'all night long traffic' noise that you will find in any big city (think New York, Sydney, etc). Other than finding a hotel with sound-proof windows, I don't think you can avoid that problem. In addition, the walls within the hotel seemed a little 'thin.'

Overall, if I visit Rome again, I will try to find another hotel.", "Date": "September 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, UK", "Title": "\u201cTiny rooms but great location!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3838951", "Content": "Great location - within 15 minutes walk of Trevi, Spanish Steps, the Pantheon etc Right by Subway and 5 minutes walk to Termini station (the main train station in Rome) - so if you can get a CHEAPER transfer to the station do it as the hotel is just around the corner. Taxi transfer from station approx. 40 euros but try Terrorvision if you are travelling by Ryanair or Easyjet - they do have a website and offer cheap coach transfers to Termini Station. The hotel - very small rooms as one would expect in a major city, linen NOT changed daily, \"kind of\" cleaned daily, croissant and bread with jam and pate with coffee/tea/juice for breakfast. Some rooms on the same floor as the reception which can sometimes be noisy if the concierge has his mates around...very helpful staff on the other hand. If you can get a balcony then do as the views are lovely-very romantic.

The Hotel is situated in great location within walking distance of all the sights, and just round the corner from the Metro which we used, for instance, to go to the Vatican City (cost 1 Euro and a few minutes!). Hotel staff so pleasant and VERY helpful, gave us advice (usually over a lovely Breakfast), let us leave our Bags with them on our leaving day, ordering us a Taxi too. Cleanliness is very important to us, and we could not have asked for more in this respect. Bathroom immaculate along with the room which was cleaned every day with fresh towells, etc. We were lucky enough to spend our last (4th) night in the Superior room which had the most romantic Terrace, with table and chairs and view to Church Santa Maria Maggiore.

We entered and took the elevator up to the fourth floor. We did not expect such a nice entry with reception and breakfast-area. The very friendly staff showed us our room which was exactly this one you can see at the hotels homepage. The nice furnished room was very clean with beautiful colors, a comfortable doublebed and beautiful parquet floor. The very clean bathroom offers toilet, bidet, shower, hairdryer and so on. What we never expected was this undescribable beautiful balcony with its columnes. We enjoyed certain evenings with candlelight and a bottle of red wine outside over the roofs of the city. The traffic below was no problem because of the heat outside we had to close the windows and used the individually controllable aircondition.
