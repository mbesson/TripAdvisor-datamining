We'd booked the rooms almost an entire year in advance. Typical of the majority of hotels in the area on race weekend, the rates almost double for Friday, Saturday and Sunday night. Can't really blame the hotel for this practice. Anyway, we had a fine stay. Our rooms were nice and the front desk worked hard to get us rooms close together. In general, the staff was friendly and helpful. We spent some time in the pool/jacuzzi; a bit of a chlorinated smell in there since it's totally enclosed and the jets on the jacuzzi went off after five minutes (a bit of a hassle to keep climbing in and out to turn them back on) BUT there were towels laid out on all of the chairs (a nice touch) and it was clean. The rooms were fine; we were next to the ice machine but for the most part, we hardly heard it. It was really quiet, too; great, considering what weekend it was. It seemed to us that the crowd there was definitely in the \"want to have fun but aren't crazy about it\" category. Average age seemed to be 50s. We ate breakfast three of the four mornings. Nice enough; a continental plus type affair. I did think it would have been nice of them to offer the breakfast outside the standard 7-10 on race day since the majority of the patrons left the hotel by 6:30 am to get to the track. They did, however, leave out cookies (and punch, I think, don't know, didn't try it) each evening in the lobby. So, if we're ever back for the race, we'd definitely stay here again. It was very convenient to the track as well as to numerous restaurants (chain and local) and a fantastic grocery store across the street.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cTypical Fairfield Inn.

The location is great for being outside of the city. There are a ton of places close by to eat, shop, and entertain you. The beds seems newer and were very comfortable. The room was clean and stayed that way during my entire stay. Breakfast area awas great. Tons of room compared to some of the others I stayed it. Which is nice to not have to bring your breakfast to your room because all 10 tables are taken up. My only problem is with the front desk. Maybe I was spoiled but my recent stays at other fairfield inns have had exceptional front desk people. Always greeting you when you come in if they weren't with a guest and always wishing you a good night or day when you left. If you could find one that was sitting around the corner they didn't even acknowledge you. Just a small issue that really didn't affect my stay so I stick with the 4 star rating.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cNice, New and Convenient\u201d", "Author": "rp17", "ReviewID": "UR20121567", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel for one Saturday night for the Motogp races at the track.
