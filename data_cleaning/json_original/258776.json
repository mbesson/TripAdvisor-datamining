It is located in a southeastern suburb of Berlin, surrounded by woods and lakes. We appreciated the free use of bicycles on the property, as there are many walking and biking paths nearby. Although we had a car, there is public transportation available, although this hotel is not located anywhere near the center city. The breakfast room is small and on the dark side and the buffet is nothing to write home about but adequate. The negative is the personality of the proprietor, who can be quite nice and friendly at times and strange and nasty at other times. He insisted that our 3-day rate did not include breakfast, although his website, the booking website, and the sign in front of the Pension stated clearly that all room rates included breakfast. His mother, who was on the premises when we arrived, did not have a reservation in our name and gave us the wrong room. We were told that breakfast was available at 7:30 but when we showed up at that time, the proprietor was annoyed and insisted that we leave and come back later because he was not ready. He yelled at me for entering his office for a pencil to fill out a form he required.", "Date": "Apr 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR390035667", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "BostonTraveler62"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d258776-r16636581-Hotel_Karolinenhof-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "258776", "Price": "$93"}}
