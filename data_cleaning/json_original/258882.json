The hotel is surrounded with very interesting art galleries, all of them worth a visit. The lobby and the inner patios are really pleasant to hang out in. We were given a room with a view of the inner patio witch made it really quiet. Over all, the hotel was really quiet. The room was spatious and the free wifi was really appreciated. The minibar was not stocked si we could cool our own drinks. There is a small pool on the roof top, with a few sun beds. It gets crowded very quickly. Since all the buildings are of the same height, it was always sunny. (with the bigger hotels you get always the shade form the skyscrapers around them and it is really annoying). Across the street - Lucy's is a very popular and fun hangout. And they make really nice breakfast.

In 2009, we stayed here pre-cruise and hoped that we would have the same wonderful experience as before again-- we did! I had booked using rewards points and was expecting a standard room-- what a surprise to find that we had been upgraded to a huge suite overlooking the inside courtyard area. The room was spotless, spacious, and beautifully decorated. (Having a hotel room with 2 televisions and 2 bathrooms was the icing on the cake for traveling with kids!) The hotel is gorgeous inside with the \"arts\" theme, and the staff is also friendly. We have stayed at some boutique hotels in large cities where the decor is the focus and not the personnel, but the Renaissance Arts has them both covered beautifully! The hotel location is ideal in that it is away from all of the noise and crowds of the French Quarter, yet it is within walking distance. The riverfront area and Harrah's are also nearby... For those of you who are cruising and looking to save a few $$, we were able to walk to the port with our luggage and save the $7/per person taxi fare to the cruise terminal. It is a few blocks, but if our kids could handle it, it is an option for those who don't mind walking and pulling suitcases behind in order to avoid a high fare for such a short distance to the port!", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "srcaOntario", "ReviewID": "UR128006473", "Content": "Quick elevators, beautiful hotel, friendly staff, no complaints at all.

I had been looking at this hotel on line, and was intrigued by what I saw. I was able to book it on the Marriott site on Monday prior to our arrival on Wednesday. My fiancee was a coach and needed to attend the coaches convention which was being held at the Convention Center and the Hilton. This was my first time to New Orleans, and this hotel did not disappoint. I had read some reviews of this hotel which were not 100% positive, and I was a little concerned, but the price was right and it was down the street from where we needed to be. When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised. I've stayed and hundreds of \"traditional\" Marriott properties, so I am always excited when I find one that isn't \"just like all the others.\" We checked in and they had upgraded us to one of the suites on the 4th floor. The outside hallway makes it look like you are entering the outside of a house. Each room even had a doorbell. The room was immaculate, and while the bathroom was small, it didn't matter because we had two as well as a living room area. Our room overlooked the courtyard area. We would stay here again without question. This hotel is unique, close to everything, but not in the middle of everything. The staff was friendly and helpful. We did try to add 4 nights to our stay, but the rate (because of the Final Four) were triple what we were paying so chose to move to another Marriott property in Metairie. We used the concierge lounge on two mornings. It is a small lounge, and opens and closes, and removes food precisely at the time it says, not one minute more. The roof top pool is great. You can see all over the city which is fun. However the pool itself is very small. The workout room is excellent and provides multiple options. You do NOT need a car at this property (or in New Orleans for that matter) as parking is at a premium and valet parking is very expensive here. The blocks are short and you can walk to the convention center, Harrah's, Riverwalk and multiple restaurants easily. All are within about a 10 minute walk. We ate desert in the restaurant which was great, and they even have rootbeer floats which you don't often see on any hotel menus. They stock the showers and bath with Aveda products, and the beds are very comfortable. If we are back here again we will certainly consider staying here. I only wished we could have afforded to stay for the entire weekend. If you are looking for late night food, the Ernst Cafe is a bar that serves great burgers and chicken sandwiches (about 4 or so blocks away). We got in late and were hungry, the two bars which are on the same street were not what we were looking for (loud and bar food), and the bummer was the restaurants all stopped serving at 10AM on the weeknights. Which sort of surprised me since we were in a city which I thought would be open \"all night\"", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NC", "Title": "\u201cNice location..but service was just \"okay\"\u201d", "Author": "Alexiaann", "ReviewID": "UR127127607", "Content": "The art is beautifully displayed inside this hotel.

I went to the valet and asked how I can arrange for a cab that early. He took my name and room info and told mere would have a car waiting for me. Woke up in the morning,got dressed and walked to the entrance and could see it was pouring rain out. So walked out and waited for a good 15 mins and no car. The lobby was all dark so I called a cab on my own and made it to airport with no problem. So your asking yourself what's the problem? Well I contacted hotel and spoke to manager and all he had to say it sounded like a scam! You should have come inside to the front desk and we would have made arrangements for you and that valet are outsourced. My response to that is when you have someone out front with a name tag greeting guests then he is a extension of you and represents the property. You should of just said I'm sorry and I will take a look into it. Instead you didn't really care. Show some leadership because I will tell you now that it just shows how much Marriott cares about its clients . If you want to be treated well take my word this place is comfy but your just a number like most otherMarriott properties where status is nothing. If you can I recommend the W on Poydras much nicer stay and the staff cares!

When I got to my room, the internet service was not working. I contacted the number provided for support, and after sitting on hold for 20 minutes or so, was told they could not help me and to call the front desk. The front desk knew nothing and did not offer any real solution. I asked, then, to change rooms. It was funny to me that the agent didn't offer to send the bellman up with the keys - instead she told me to come downstairs. In my new room, the toilet immediately stopped up and ran all night. This room also lacked an in-room safe, something I always utilize and something I never find absent from a hotel room. The room had so much empty space as well - it was as if it needed additional furniture or something. I ordered dinner with room service - the NY Strip Steak.

We had an excellent deal on the place, which made a good hotel even better. The hotel's lobby, bar, and restaurant are all very impressive. Modern, arty, chic, and clean. While we didn't eat in the restaurant ever, it wasn't empty, which says something for a hotel with lots of other good places to eat around it. The room itself was great. Though square-footage wise, it was slightly on the small side (our king-bed room didn't leave a lot of extra floor space), the bed made up for anything else the room was lacking. At a glance, I thought it was going to be disappointing, as the mattress looked thin. But it was one of the most comfortable night's sleep I've had at a hotel in years. The mattress was phenomenal, the pillows soft, and the sheets velvety. It was hard to check out from. Also of note in the room was a mini-fridge. The bathroom was clean, and the shower quite excellent. Located in the Warehouse Arts District, we were surrounded by quality restaurants and lots of bars. Other standard places were a bit farther (it was a solid 15 - 20 minute walk to the closest drug store or grocery story). The French Quarter is walking distance, albeit a long walk, and though we never took a cab to and from the front desk staff said cabs from there to the hotel run roughly $7. We actually preferred being somewhat removed from the madness, and appreciated being in a quieter area. The only issue we had with the hotel was the parking: $31 a day for valet is your only option. We quickly figured out a trick to beat the system though. Street parking around the hotel is plentiful, and free from 6pm - 8am. New Orleans has a \"pay by phone\" parking system, so you just set up your phone account the night before, then get the info of the meter where you parked, set your alarm for 8am, wake up, make a 30 second call, and go back to sleep. For $3, you have two hours of parking. Repeat at 10am as needed, or actually head out with your car. Over the course of three nights and four days there, we didn't even spend close to $31 total. Had we gone with valet, it would have been over $100 for parking alone. It's sort of a pain in the butt to wake up every morning (even for two minutes) at 8am, but for us it was worth it to save the money. The hotel staff were fine, some nicer and more helpful than others, and definitely not the standout feature of the hotel. A few staff members were friendly and welcoming, others seemed mildly annoyed to be bothered with questions or problems. It wasn't a huge issue, but it wasn't the best service I've ever had at a hotel. (Again though, the bed was so comfortable that it made up for it.) This was a very good hotel.

When I called to inquire, the front desk told me only certain rooms have Wi-Fi. I think most citizens of the 21st century would agree that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the stupidest thing ever. But whatever, I asked how much I would have to pay to upgrade to a \"Wi-Fi\" room. The Response, \" You paid on hotels.com so we can't do anything for you.\" What?!? Is that a joke? No it's real. In reality, the lady was insinuating that because I made my reservations on hotels.com I was a 2nd class customer and that my options for upgrades or switches were restricted. 2. One late night I went to the front desk to ask for a spoon for my yogurt. The Response, \" go get one from the kitchen.\" Yea, the kitchen that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pitch dark at 11pm--that one. The guy who said it resembles Braxton from the Jamie Fox Show so look out for him should you ever end up stranded at this DEAD END DESTINATION. To add insult to injury, I got back to my room only to find out my refrigerator was BROKEN. Not the obvious type of broken, but the kind where it looks like it's working but actually it's just staying luke-warm. Lost $50 worth of perishable goods. 3. My co-worker had the breakfast. Terrible. Two bites and pushed it away. 4. They missed my wake up call, twice!!! 5. But here is the best one: I was trying to use the printer in the computer room. Of course like everything else in this place- it wasn't working. So I went to the Front Desk. I liked the guy who worked the desk that night, so I won't throw him under the bus. But get this, I said to him can you fix the printer because myself and another hotel patron need to print something off for work. He said, I can't fix it man, but come into the back and use the back office printer. I said thanks, and replied should I grab the other guy who needs to print his work stuff. He replied: NO!! I'll be honest guys. New Orleans is such a great place that it's easy to forget that this is a service based economy. These hotels compete on SERVICE. The valet service was GREAT. The Concierge service was GREAT. But the real service that matters, Front Desk, Restaurant, etc. is the PITTS! My company pays for my room and food so I don't care about the MONEY, I care about the EXPERIENCE. I check out on Friday because it was SO BAD and move over to The W for my remaining 2 nights.

I can't lower the rating for that because it was our own fault, but I would like to point it out so that others can be prepared. You are not allowed to park your own car. They will take your vehicle when you arrive, for a $28 charge, and park it in a place that you are not allowed to access. We had been to a few other downtown Marriott hotels previous to New Orleans and never encountered not being able to have access to our car. They stated that they would drive the car around if we needed it for anything, but that didn't really pan out the way they said. Another charge that we were not prepared for was the fee for having the Internet in your room. ($12.95 per night using the cable or more $$ using wireless) We opted not to pay for it. Most of the staff was very friendly, the art was interesting to look at around the hotel, and the place was very quiet. I don't think there were very many people staying there when we were there, which may explain the emptiness and quietness. The elevator had some kind of sticky goo on the rails and spilled liquid on the floor for hours which kinda grossed me out every time I used it.

A couple of minor things to point out: the water in the shower fluctuated from tepid to scalding; the shower curtain was almost too short to direct the water into the tub, and the carpet was fairly worn in the traffic areas. The closet door is on an auto-close hinge, making it difficult to choose an outfit! :) However, the room was very clean and the furnishings were great.

Housed in a solid old warehouse building, the Renaissance boasts large windows (which unfortunately do not open) a wonder-ful indoor art garden courtyard and rooftop pool and hot tub. Some rooms are larger than others, the corners are of the most ample with decent decor and analogue televisions (which I happen to prefer over flat screens). The bathtubs are too small to soak, so a roomy stand up shower would have been a better fit. Aveda toiletries were a welcome little bonus. If you were to stay here a day or two, I imagine your stay would be smooth sailing. If like me however you spend a few weeks at the hotel (quite likely any hotel) you'll begin to notice where it falls short. The main issue is the lack of effective communication among the staff. Although most of the them are friendly, they do not function as a team. And so when you call the front desk with a request, if the person on the other line cannot take care of it immediately, themselves, which often they cannot, the message is quickly lost in the telephone chain. Here's an example: Hello, my tea mug (from home) has gone missing since the room was cleaned this afternoon, can I speak to housekeeping? No, I cannot connect you directly. I will call them to inquire and get back to you. Next day, no call back. So I call again. And the next day go down to the front desk and remind them. On day three someone from reception calls me say that housekeeping knows nothing about it... Really? That's the best you can do? And if my laptop had gone missing? Complete lack of accountability. The next week I ask the front desk, on three separate occasions if they have packages for me that should have been delivered. No they don't. After a week of asking I finally insisted that they went to speak to the guard who had signed for them. I had his name from the tracking info. Oh, what do you know, they do have them... Obviously communication is a problem here. A hotel probably has at least three shifts of staff on a daily basis, how they relay information to one another is crucial in making sure things run smoothly.

There are a few glaring deficiencies. First, the hotel has a serious issue with the supply of hot water. On one morning, it was tepid at best and our entire group of friends complained about it. Not a good way to start the day. In addition, some members of our group had issues with water pressure. In one case, they barely had a trickle of water in the shower. This is an issue that most guests are unwilling to tolerate. Room service also left items off the order.

PROS: Great air/hotel deal via Priceline. Nice lobby and very appealing hallways with (seemingly) new carpeting. Friendly front deskers. When the area had a sewer-water problem, we were provided with lots of bottled water (guests at the nearby Hilton Riverfront apparently weren't given anything). Nice bathroom w/ good shower. Fridge in the room! Not loaded with mini-bar crap, just a great space to keep snacks and a beverage or two (there's a Walgreens on Canal St.). Not a lot of cable channels, but the TV set is good, and HBO is included. My wife loved our (painted) exposed brick wall w/ windows facing the street, which gives the room a touch of a Greenwich Village-apartment feel. CONS: Room carpet is downright worn and shabby and really deteriorates from the overall room. I peeked into some other rooms nearby when maids were cleaning, and their carpets were the same, Just changing the carpets would raise the room from a \"B\" to an \"A-\". One of the room's lampshades also had seen seriously better days. Lobby has piped in perfumed air, which is not my thing and probably more bothersome to people with allergies. They charge $13 a night for WiFi (includes free local & long distance phone), and there are no free computers to use in the lobby, so prepare to be gouged or go elsewhere for the `net. In this day and age and in a hotel like this, WiFi should be part of the package. There are free USA Today's in the lobby, but no free newspaper at your room door. There's an odd blue sculpture on the bathroom wall - nothing wrong with that, but it collects a lot of dust in its nooks and crannies that is never properly cleaned. Kinda gross. OTHER: Excellent mattress but very soft (feather?) pillows. When I asked for foam pillows to be brought up, two more pillows were delivered - but they were feather, also. When we first checked in, we asked for a quiet room. The desk attendant suggested a room on the second floor looking into the \"garden\" (which is inside the hotel). Turns out the garden is just a couple of plants, and near them is a rotating metal sculpture with spotlights around it. This flickering monstrosity would have been right outside our window, so we changed rooms immediately! There's a noisy tavern, Lucy's, on the other side of the street on Tchoupitoulas, but the rooms are very quiet, so you literally won't notice it until you're outside. Also, Tchoup is far enough away from Bourbon Street to be an overall quieter neighborhood. There's a gym, an outdoor pool and hot tub, but I didn't get a chance to use `em. OVERALL: Quite satisfied with the stay, but wouldn't necessarily run back. They need to change the carpets immediately and stop gouging for WiFi.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cSpectacular place in a great location!\u201d", "Author": "flymeaway89", "ReviewID": "UR88050720", "Content": "The staff at the hotel were very nice and accomodating.

The trip was a surprise gift to her in celebration of her birthday. We've been to NOLA twice before, each time for a business-related convention or conference, so it was nice to have time to just enjoy the city without business commitments. We're also dedicated \"foodies,\" who love good food and wine, and NOLA is one of the nation's destination cities for fine dining experiences. In selecting a hotel, I generally look for three things: location, comfort and price (not always in that order). We had previously stayed at the W and the Intercontinental in the Central Business District, so I decided to look elsewhere. The French Quarter has many excellent hotels, but I found most of their prices to be too high, to say nothing of the street noise. A quick online search turned up the Renaissance Arts Hotel (Marriott) in the Warehouse District. I went through the Marriott website and found a deluxe room for $119, a price that was hard to beat. (Local and state taxes add about $18 to the base rate.) That more than satisfied my \u00e2\u20ac\u0153price\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd criteria. The Warehouse District is an \"up and coming\" neighborhood in the city, and young professionals, artists and gallery owners are taking advantage of low real estate prices to rebuild the area. Many industrial buildings have been converted to residential and commercial use while preserving the warehouse \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The hotel is conveniently located to the Convention Center \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a three-block walk. (I wish I had known about The Renaissance Arts when I was in town on business.) It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 10-minute walk to the Central Business District and an additional 5-minutes to the edge of the French Quarter. The Harrah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Casino is a 12-minute walk. We enjoy walking in big cities and although access to a rental car for a couple of days would have been nice, when I added up the cost of the rental, gas and overnight parking, it made more sense to walk and use mass transit. We took a cab only once \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to have dinner at Brigtstens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Restaurant in the River Bend area. (Well worth the trip!) For mass transit, the Canal Street streetcar is a four-block walk, the St. Charles Street line is three blocks away, and the Riverfront street car line is about four blocks from the hotel. The wonderful spring weather (sunny and 65 degrees with low humidity) made walking a real pleasure. Just be sure to wear comfortable shoes. The Warehouse District neighborhood has a wonderful assortment of dining establishments, including Tommy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cuisine (Italian), Emeril\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (Creole), Rio Mar (Spanish Seafood), Conchon (pork) and Deannie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (great breakfasts and lunches and the best shrimp Po\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Boy sandwich I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found in NOLA), all within a short walk from the hotel. The Wine Institute of New Orleans (W.I.N.O.) is just a block away. (W.I.N.O. has 120 wines available for tasting in your choice of one, two or three once doses.) You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat the location. Criteria #2 satisfied. As for the hotel itself, we found it to be excellent. The building exterior preserves the original warehouse look and the interior public spaces are bright, modern and elegant. Modern works of art are prominently featured throughout the public areas, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even a sculpture garden on the mezzanine level. It has the hipness of the W, without the annoying house music. We stayed in Room 412, a deluxe king room. The 450-square foot room had two windows overlooking a side street with a view of the Central Business District to the west. The room had the usual amenities: a king bed with excellent mattress and very nice linens (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so glad that the hotel chains are finally focusing on sleeping comfort!); a work desk with work light, phone and high-speed internet connection (there was a charge for Internet service, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use it); and a one-cup coffee maker; an ergonomic desk chair and a comfy chair and ottoman. The conventional TV, four storage drawers, a security safe and a mini-bar fridge were housed in a large armoire. Closet space was more than adequate and there were plenty of hangers for our clothes. Terry cloth robes (always a nice touch) were not provided. The room was in very good overall condition and quite comfortable. I requested foam pillows with my reservation, but the supplied pillows were feather filled. A quick call to the front desk corrected the oversight. The bathroom was bright and very clean, although it had only one sink and counter space was a bit limited for two people. The high-end toiletry items were excellent and were freshly replaced each day. The towels could have been thicker and we requested additional towels from the housekeeper on two occasions. The shower water pressure was a bit weak, but there was plenty of hot water for two morning showers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my habit to leave a cash tip for housekeeping personal each day of my stay to ensure excellent service. I was not disappointed. We did not use the pool (heated outdoor), fitness center or business center, so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on those facilities. A computer station and printer were available (just off the main lobby), so we were able to print our Southwest Airlines boarding passes 24-hours before our return flight. The only disappointment was the front-end staff. There was no bellman available for assist us with our luggage on arrival, so we schlepped our own bags (no big deal). The check-in procedure was quick, although the desk clerk could have shown a little more enthusiasm in welcoming us. Check-out was excellent. We had a late afternoon flight and the hotel was able to store our luggage for several hours, enabling us to enjoy one last excellent meal in NOLA. Cabs to the airport were waiting and the bellman cheerfully assisted us with our luggage. Check off criteria #3. Overall, we found the Renaissance Arts Hotel to be excellent and would recommend the hotel to friends and business associates. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back.", "Date": "March 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cRenaissance Arts Hotel, beautiful place to stay !\u201d", "Author": "Graceland1977", "ReviewID": "UR57344199", "Content": "I loved this hotel !

The room was spacious and bathroom ok. Nothing spectacular - your standard Marriott fare. What I don't understand is why these rooms still have an old tube tv?? Our biggest complaint is that the water in the shower/bath did not get very hot. I notified the reception 3 separate times and they said they were going to send \"engineering\" to look at it, but at the end of the day, I never really got hot water. Besides that, the service at the front desk + concierge is not very helpful. First of all, they are never around and never once did the the reception desk staff ask us if they could help us, even though it is very clear that there are people waiting at the concierge desk. There was staff passing us all the time, but nobody reached out to us - until the actual concierge returned.

It is 4 blocks from canal street. 6 blocks from bourbon street. 5 Blocks from Riverwalk and Harrah's casino. We went to the Saints/Pats game and it was about 8 blocks to the Superdome. It is 3 blocks to the St Charles St trolley and as mention 4 blocks to the Canal St trolley. 10 minute walk to bourbon street and 20 minute walk to lower french quarter. Close enough to the activity yet you are not right in the middle of it at night when you are trying to sleep. Never felt unsafe the whole trip even while wearing colors of the opposing NE Pats. We walked everywhere, using just the Riverwalk trollery once (at bottom of Canal street) to take us to the lower french quarter for only $1.25/passenger per ride. STAFF: treated very professionally and pleasantly by staff members at front desk and the valet staff. Did not use room service. Also, had a snack/drink in the hotel restaurant and our needs were attended to adequately. Hotel restaurant is pricey for drinks and food. ROOM: We had king size room on 4th floor (there are only 5) that faced the Mississippi, however there was a taller building blocking our view of the river. Older picture tube 25inch TV with remote. There was a compact size refrigerator which we used for storing drinks which was nice. Plenty of space. Separate chair/ottoman. And a desk with internet hookup. This floor houses their club/membership rooms, of which we did not get one, those rooms have free internet and even though we didn't get one I was able to pick up a wireless signal from them and did not have to pay for internet service which I believe was $12/day if you hook up to it. Bathroom was a little smaller than average size for a 3 1/2-4* hotel as it is listed on most travel websites. Shower/tub combo with adequate water pressure. Room was fairly clean. Small carpet stain was only negative I could find. Very quiet sleeping even though there were other guests in the rooms on both sides of us. Bed has firm/comfortable mattress.

We stayed for 3 days, and our experience from valet to checkout was absolutely wonderful. The hotel lobby is very contemporary and elaborate. Check-in took all of 5 minutes. There is a small room to the right of the check-in desk with snacks, drinks, disposable cameras, and an ATM. Soft drink and ice machines are also located on each floor near the elevator. Our room was on the 4th floor in the Club Lounge area. For those of you with access to this level, you can obtain free soft drinks and water from this area as well as having a continental breakfast, including scrambled eggs, everyday except Saturday and Sunday. The lounge offers hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oeuvres during meal times as well as free Internet access, television, and books to read. There is also a restaurant adjoining the hotel lobby, which is quite elegant, but we were dressed casual when we ate there for breakfast, as the restaurant was not very busy. The breakfast buffet was around 16 dollars and featured sausage, bacon, pastries, juice, cereal, and made to order eggs. The fifth floor has an exercise area with several elliptical machines and a few weight lifting stations. On this same floor, proceed out the door to the right to access the pool and hot tub area, which has several seating areas, arranged with a beautiful view of the New Orleans skyline. Be aware that this area has a room key access to return to the building, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget your room key or you may be on the roof for a while enjoying the view. There was a king-sized bed in our room, which was soft and comfortable. The entertainment-center featured free cable with HBO and of course my favorite, webtv Internet access as well as a huge in-room movie selection. There was also a small refrigerator and a digital safe inside the entertainment center. Internet access from your own computer could be obtained for 12.95 per day. The air conditioner works very well and is controlled by a digital thermostat. There is a small business area in the corner of the room outfitted with a nice table, chair, and coffee maker. The closet is large enough for a small family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothing. This is where the iron and ironing board are stored. We found the bathroom area to be quite nice featuring a dresser-like sink stand with granite counter tops as well as a nice size bathtub with a diffusing shower cap. There is a large window in the room with a view of the small side street and adjacent building. Our room was very clean and there is a digital do-not-disturb button located next to the door, which was quite nice. The valet was obtained by a phone call to the front desk. Our car was ready within 5 minutes of the call and was always waiting for us by the time we made it downstairs. We were in and out of the hotel three or four times per day and the valet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were always courteous. I highly recommend the valet service due to the fact that the other option is a Central Parking managed area located about a block from the hotel with no in and out privilege. This parking area does not offer an attendant, but has a computerized ticketing system and the overnight rate was 28 dollars, which is the same price as the hotel valet service. It was much more convenient having our car brought to the front door. We were in New Orleans for the NSTA convention and this hotel is only about three blocks from the convention center. We made the walk one morning with our child in his stroller, which was quite nice. The only other advice I can offer is to remember to look up when searching for this hotel. The only sign for the hotel is located on top of the building. We passed it up several times before locating it.

The person I spoke with indicated a note would be made on my reservation and that it would be no problem, albeit, she sounded ambivilent. Upon arrival, Nathalie noted that there were no notes on the reservation and she indicated that no king beds would be available during our stay. After expressing my disappointment, Nathalie was able to unblock an exterior corner king. The room was blocked because it was to have some carpet sections replaced. The room clearly needed to have some carpeting replaced. My sense is that some rooms have already been through this process--hence the reviews about no carpet stains. Ours was pretty stained and torn up--so it's good they'll be replacing. The duvet in our room was also stained and looked like it needed to be changed. Again, Nathalie was the only real standout on the staff--most were aloof at best--especially the bell staff.

Didn't try it as it is pricey and I didn't want to try it. Lucy's a fun surf bar across the street had 8 dollar hamburgers and other bar food. Service was great and food was reasonable and tastey. The French quarter is a 15 minute walk and we would walk there and take a cab back. Cab fare was $7.50 for 2. Trolley stop at St. Charles and Julia was close by. It costs 1.25 a person exact change only. We took the Cajun tours/Honey Island Swamp tour booked through the hotel. It costs 49 dollars and AAA discount is 2 dollars off each person. The bus picks you right up at the hotel. During the colder weather there aren't many alligators to see. My daughter enjoyed it but I wouldn't recommend it during the colder months. Saw just a few small baby alligators. Driver will drop you off in Downtown French Quarter if you like on the way back. Bus driver was very prompt and professional. We took the Celebration Tours City/Katrina tour. It is approximately 3 hours and very informative. Mike Marino our tour guide spoke constantly never taking a break. Bordered on giving me a headache but overall a great tour. A small van with a maximum room for 14 people, cost of 49 dollars. Look for coupons in the New Orleans guide which you can order for free online and save 10 dollars each. They pick you up very promptly at the hotel and will drop you off downtown on the way to dropping folks off at the hotel. Very professional people run this operation. Cab service to the airport and back is $30 each way for two people. I would definitely go back to this hotel if I return to New Orleans.

We were also pleasantly surprised to find a refrigerator in the room. The room was very clean and comfortable. The bed was on the soft side but still comfortable with good quality bedding. We found the hotel to be very quiet at night and were able to sleep well. The only glitch we encountered (and it turned out to be minor but did give us a bit of a scare) was a problem with the valet parking. When we checked in, we went to the valet and he told us that he didn't think there were any spaces available! When we expressed our displeasure, he then assured us that he would find a spot---even if we had to leave the car outside the hotel all night. The desk clerk told us if that happened, the car wouldn't be towed. As it turned out, he did find a spot and the car was returned to us the next day without any problems. In fact, we didn't have much of a wait to get it, either, despite the valet warning us that there may well be a wait in the morning. Would we stay here again? Certainly!

We found the space ample, the beds very comfortable, the TV selection good, all needed amenities. The mini-fridge in the room was locked, and when I called the front desk, they said that they had discontinued using the ones installed in the room, but immediately offered to bring up another for us. We loved the coffee and the bath products by Lather, which were completely restocked each day. Very comfortable, soft towels also. Climate control was excellent, very efficient A/C. The location of the hotel was ideal, very close to the site of the conference I was attending (by the convention center), but significantly cheaper than the actual conference hotel (and closer to the nightlife). There is a rooftop patio and pool, where I sat to work one evening with my laptop and watched a gorgeous sunset. There are great restaurants on the same street or very close by, including Cochon (highly recommend), and also a wonderful self-serve wine bar called WINO (very highly recommend). The staff at the hotel were amazing and saved my life, practically, on several occasions. At one point, I visited the Business Center on the ground floor to print a presentation text for the conference. The printer seemed to be having issues, so I stuck my head in the business office for assistance. A wonderfully sweet and helpful woman named Erica immediately interrupted her work and came to my rescue, and using my flash drive, she printed the presentation for me on the computer in her office, all in a matter of minutes.

The bath, though small, was nicely appointed with a granite counter and Kohler fixtures. Everything was clean and new looking. Towels were nice and thick. There was a coffeemaker, safe and a fridge that we did not use. Internet was around $12 a day but one could use the hotel computers free in a room off the lobby.

Once we arrived, we were escorted to a room that left a lot to be desired. The carpet was dull & stained & was rolling up in areas. There were nasty stains on both the duvet cover and the sheets. The room was geared for a handicap guest, which we are not. This meant a shorter vanity & a shower with a fold-down bench & hand-held nozzle (you couldn't get under the water hands-free). We requested a move and were given a regular room, with a regular shower, that was much cleaner without sacrificing much space. The room size was very impressive; important when you're sharing a room. Other Issues: The door didn't lock on our 2nd room; something that we didn't immediately notice. It was fixed promptly, but shouldn't have been an issue in the first place. The gold carpet, in every room that we saw is very worn, shabby & in need of replacement. The room decor is very modern & minimalist which didn't appeal to my travel companion. I like modern furnishings, but didn't find the hotel decorated to a 4-star level. Example: There was a large round table in front of the elevators on our floor & it was screaming for a flower arrangement, vase or piece of art. It looked odd because it was bare. As a matter of fact, there were no flowers displayed anywhere in this hotel. It is NOT a luxuriously appointed property, by any stretch of the imagination. For nearly $300/night, I expected more. We had a concierge level package and weren't very impressed with the offerings in the club room. The evening appetizers were limited & nothing special. The breakfast was a simple continental spread. Just OK. We did have access to sodas & bottled water, which was nice. We expected a concierge to be visible & available, but the desk was empty during our 5-day stay. The front desk staff was a mixed bag. We were not greeted warmly at all. Several staff members were friendly & accomodating & others displayed a complete lack of concern & enthusiasm. Example: When we switched rooms, we were not offered assistance (my traveling companion is elderly). The valet parking is over-priced at $28/day, but the valet staff were consistently nice & helpful to us & the service was fast & efficient. Don't expect Bath & Body Works toiletries. They are Lather products & are just OK. Our experience with the hotel restaurant/bar was very good. You must try their signature french toast for breakfast. It's wonderful!

I would give this hotel 4.5 stars but if pushed it was nearer a 5 than a 4. We picked the hotel based upon the trip adviser reviews (including comfort of bed), price, room size. The beds were amazingly comfortable and the rooms an excellent size. The hotel was very spacious and clean. The bar area was superb. People were often down there just talking to each other and enjoying drinks. We ate a couple of times at the adjoining restaurant (LaC\u00c3\u00b4te Brasserie). This was due to exhaustion from travelling. Having read some reviews on here we were not expecting much, so were blown away. The shrimp starter was out of this world. For a main we ordered the steak and it is probably one of the tastiest and best cooked steaks I have had. We ate and ordered after recommendations from other satisfied customers. Location wise, we enjoyed it. There are restaurants such as Emeril's, Cochon, Mulate's, Rio Mar all 2 minutes walking distance. There are also other highly regarded restaurants such as La Boca, Restaurant August within easy walking distance. Lucy's a great bar is opposite the hotel and especially good before a Saints game. The bar as discussed previously is lively and friendly, especially the bar man Bruce. Other close amenities include the aquarium, riverwalk shopping mall, Harrah's casino, Magazine Street and the streetcar from outside the Hilton (and Drago's restaurant for their charbroiled oysters) to the French Market in the French Quarter. The only slight negative for this hotel is if you wish to spend your entire holiday in the French Quarter (which would be a mistake anyway). The French Quarter and Bourbon Street are about 15 minutes walking distance but if you walk there and back daily as well as round the City it can become quite tiresome on the feet. Taxis however are only around \u00c2\u00a32 and even with a tip \u00c2\u00a33 isn't going to break the bank. Donald Trump has bought a site round the corner from The Renaissance Arts and the casino is round there so you're not in a location isolated from the centre We were weighing up 2 hotels in New Orleans. The other didn't have a roof top pool. I would say that is an essential. There were a few hours a day when we just wanted to relax and enjoy the sun.

The trip from the airport was about 20 minutes and te drive had no difficulty locating the hotel on Tchoupitoulas St. Upon entering the lobby, we were impressed by the artwork everywhere - Dale Chihuly light fixtures, a gallery of artwork past the front desk, a sculpture garden - it all gave you a great first impression. Check-in was quick, efficient and friendly and we were on our way to our room on the second floor within a few short minutes. The room was relatively large by city hotel standards. Very high ceilings with exposed brick walls and a view over Tchoupitoulas St. below. Thought we might have a noise problem from the street, but it was whisper quiet in our room the whole stay. The room was well furnished - Marriott's great \"Revive\" bed with luxurious linen, plenty of pillow, an overstuffed chair with ottoman and side table, work desk with task chair, armoir with TV, etc. There was a charge for internet access - I believe hotels should just include that fee in the room price (even if they can then call it \"free\"). The armoire had a refrigerator that was tagged \"not for use\" (it must have been a former minibar), but we were able to obtain a key and use it quite adequately as a wine cooler. The bathroom was a bit small, but wellequiped - plentiful, lush towels, a nice selection of toiletries, good water pressure and plenty of water. A real hairdryer with plenty of power. Although housekeepng kept the room spotlessly clean, the one morning I requested a specific cleaning time while shopping in the French Quarter was not honored. When I returned and spoke to the Front Desk, they assured me it would be done within the hour and they would come into the rsstaurant to tell me it was finished. Room was cleaned, but no one told me. The restaurant itself (La Cote Brasserie) has a few issues. I though it was pretty ordinary for a hotel restaurant - decent enough food with a nod to New Orleans specialties, but slow waitstaff even on a quiet day. Also, they need to pay more attention to details - cleared table with napkins left on the floor, smashed potato chips under tables, smeared, dirty window overlooking the street. We thought the staff was trying very hard to meet our needs. The Concierge wasn't available most of our stay, so we dealt with the Front Desk employees mostly. Sent me to a spectacular needlepoint shop in the French Quarter, though couldn't seem to order a cab one night (snagged our own around the corner).

We stayed based on excellent Tripadvisor reviews that were 100% on the money! The location was ideal as it is a 10 minute walk to the Convention Center, close to several museums and the St. Charles Streetcar line, and a 15 minute walk to the French Quarter. We liked being able to come back to a neighborhood that was lively, but more relaxed and quiet than the craziness of the French Quarter! This hotel had the atmosphere of a boutique hotel with artsy modern design and furniture. The rooms are big and we felt very relaxed with ample amenities. Tall windows faced the street, making the room airy and bright. The bed was comfortable with soft linen. The bathroom is small but well designed with plenty of counter space (nice smelling shampoo and lotion too!). The staff was friendly and super helpful. At the hotel (and all around New Orleans) there was plenty of Southern hospitality and we were told more than once by employees that they were appreciative of the desperately needed business tourists bring to this recovering city. We had a tasty breakfast and delicious snacks in the La Cote Brasserie on the hotel's first floor which is much better than a typical hotel eatery. Mother's, famous for po' boys was two blocks away where we had a huge southern style breakfast and tasty sandwich lunch. Red Fish Grill (casual, moderate$) and G.W. Fin's (dressy, $$ but worth every penny) are within walking distance in the French Quarter. Both had excellent seafood and great service. In all, highly recommended for great location and accomodations.", "Date": "August 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cedar Falls, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Taffeta", "ReviewID": "UR5411035", "Content": "I hadn't been to the Warehouse Arts district of New Orleans for several years. It becomes more and more interesting with art galleries, restaurants, and wonderful hotels - especially the Renaissance Arts. My luggage was lost on the way to N.O., and the hotel staff could not have been more helpful in giving me as many necessary items as they could, in directing me to the nearest Walgreens to buy more, and in doing all they could to make the stay as pleasant as possible. I didn't get my luggage until only a day before leaving, but was not too concerned about it, partly due to the efforts of the hotel staff to ensure my comfort. The room was extra wide and roomy for one person. All fixtures and equipment worked well. The cotton robe was very much appreciated! The bed was very comfortable. The hotel was quiet -- my room looked out on an internal atrium, not on the street. The hotel restaurant was excellent -- the creme brulee is recommended for dessert. It was one of the best I've tasted. The Renaissance Arts is just a few blocks from the French Quarter, Canal Street, the Convention Center, and the Mississippi River. It is in a converted warehouse, and the renovation must be fairly recent because everything looks very new and clean. There is modern artwork hanging all over, and some beautiful glass chandeliers in the lobby that look like they could have been designed by Dale Chihuly. Overall, this is one of the best hotel stays I've experienced in a long time. I hope to stay there in the future, when my luggage is not lost.

I'm a woman and felt confident walking to the hotel each night. This is the place if you like contemporary design and furniture. The linens on the comfortable bed are good, the room and public areas are decorated with original art and there's sculpture in the covered courtyard. The in-room safe is great, the bathroom is small but perfect and cotton robes hang in the closet. There are bright carpets in the public spaces that put a smile on your face. The staff was welcoming and helpful with everything from wake-up calls and taxi arrangements to being just plain friendly to tired travelers. Two elevators never allow more than a minute's wait. (I never realized how much time I spent waiting for hotel elevators.) The restaurant is many cuts about the normal chain hotel restaurant.

I think that this was and excellent choice of hotel because of the location, cleanliness, staff support, and less confusion. The only gripe we had was that the restaurant was not the best.
