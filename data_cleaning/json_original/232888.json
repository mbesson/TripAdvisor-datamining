Excellent Staff that speaks good English!\u201d", "Author": "Andz L", "ReviewID": "UR127944766", "Content": "We stayed here last week, me and my family really enjoyed our stay. The staff treated us really well and they speak really good English so you wouldn't have to look up translation etc to speak with the staff. When we got to the hotel, we were welcomed by Ruby from the reception and we were offered if we wanted to go to the bar (met barman Shukri who was really nice to us) and we got to our room really quick and easy. They also offer wi-fi which was essential for me. First of all, the location. People are looking for a hotel which is not far from the center. This hotel is right next to the center, 15mins max walk to the colosseum and the termini station is only 2 mins walk. From Termini station, you can get the metro to different tourist attraction locations really easy for only \u20ac1 (even to the Vatican City). Also, we got the train from the Fiumicino airport to Termini station which only took 32mins. Next is the rooms in the hotel. Our room was really great and spacious. We had an executive room which had a table, 2 chairs and a sofa. And don't forget the beds of course. There was a fridge and a safe to put your luxurious things. The only thing I did not like was the glass doors to the toilet. You might not be able to see the person inside perfectly, but you can still see the figure of someone sitting on the toilet or having a shower. The breakfast was great in the morning. A lot of selection, from freshly baked bread to cold cuts and don't forget the cakes. Joyce offered to make us cappuccino and if we wanted other drinks. You can fill yourself up ready to go to your destination nice and early. Overall, really great hotel to stay in. If you ask the staff, they will point you to the right direction and give you the best advice.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milano", "Title": "\u201cmy last stay in Rome\u201d", "Author": "Truedreamer", "ReviewID": "UR127940009", "Content": "I spent just one night in Ariston Hotel in April 2012 for a business trip.

I had a twin room. There are TV and complimentary coffee available in the room. The self service breakfast, included in the room rate, was good, nothing special, but enough to start the day with energies, even if i missed my cappuccino, because here they serve only coffee made with an automatic machine.

Very convenient for the Termini main station, for arrival and departure, and for the Metro for visiting the Colosseum, the Vatican, etc. Smallish room with small window opening onto a dark fire escape. Curtains would not open all the way. MFI type fitted wardrobe. Free safe. Coffee making facilities. Large, comfortable double bed. Good shower but shower room had large crack in window and some skirting trim missing. Cleaning regular and apparently efficient but champagne cork under edge of bed for 2 days. (I know - I should have put it in the bin myself.) Drinks at the bar are expensive, as in many places in Rome, and we had to ask for the price list: coke \u00a34.50 and beer \u00a37. Bar staff were reluctant to allow us to pay cash for drinks and wanted us to put them on our room bills. The barman had to go to the reception desk to get change for us each time we paid. 7/10 for accuracy here, though all ok in the end. We took advantage of the 'happy hour' when we arrived; this amounts to free bruschetta and nibbles at the bar with drinks the same price. We don't visit Rome very often so we thought we'd do the same thing again the next night, Sunday. Unfortunately, despite the permanent 'happy hour' sign this only applies to Fridays and Saturdays. So I altered their sign for them so other guests werent confused. Breakfast was very good: in pleasant surroundings with a good range of high quality buffet items. Catering staff were efficient and polite. The girls on reception were extremely helpful and polite. When we needed help and advice this was given accurately, efficiently and sympathetically, with no condescending or arrogant advice. So if you need help, make sure you ask the girls, especially if you need access to an english speaking doctor to prescribe painkillers and antibiotics for a young person's chest/throat/ear infection. They got us a doctor in double quick time and sorted the problem. Great service.

The reception area is nice enough, and the breakfast was decent (although they had bad American pop music absolutely BLASTING at 8 am -- way too early for Jordan Bieber), but the double room we had was barely bigger than the bed itself.

The rooms are large, clean and again are smartly decorated with modern furnishings however as per previous reviews the same problems persist as follows. Shower doors did not meet and so water leaked on to the bathroom floor. Additionally seal on the shower doors was hanging off. Mould was present around the frame and base of the shower tray. TV remote control was broken and held together with ageing sellotape. Beds were hard and uncomfortable as were the pillows. Views from both aspects of our rooms were horrible, looking out into a grim courtyard surrounded on two sides by the balconies of equally grim blocks of flats whose balconies were festooned with washing and fridges. Location in Termini is good logistically for getting around the city however the entire area is pretty run down and shabby looking and is frequented by dodgy characters and prostitutes on the street immediately outside the hotel front door however this is outside the hotel's control and so should not be classed as a critisism of the hotel itself.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Youngfamily004", "ReviewID": "UR119871199", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel with my husband and two young daughters (6 & 8).

I thought the price was perfect for a 4 star hotel but my two friends I went with were expecting a little more. The view wasn't great, we looked out on to a wall and some fire escape stairs but that was fine as they dressed the whole wall with lights and net curtains so that wasnt a problem. The room was air conditioned, immaculately clean, the beds were extremely comfy and the room very quiet. I slept every night like a baby. The hotel is located perfectly for Central Termini which suited us as we got the train to and from Fiumcino airport. (Take the Leanardo Express 14 euros each, each way.) The Trevi fountain and Spanish steps were about a 30 minute walk, the Coliseum about a 15 minute walk and the Vatican City about an hour away. This was fine for us though. We were there for 4 nights and 5 days and we saw and did everything we wanted to do. The Hotel has maps in the lobby which we found very useful. Most nights we would sit in the chill out room which was always empty and quiet. There was the happy hour with free food when a drink was ordered but we didnt do this as there were plenty of lovely cheap reastaurants around us. For a main, dessert and drink I dont think we ever paid more than 15 euros each. Everyone is very friendly and helpful, especially the bar man, (sorry forgot his name) Our room wasn't dated at all. Lovely and modern with a separate shower and toilet to the bath and sink. Red and pruple bathroom but the room itself was white.

After reading so many negative responses to staying near termini, my hopes were minimal. All i wanted was a clean place to stay the night after cancelling our booking at another hotel (bad review from our group whom left earlier). Last minute booking was done via booking.com. I wish they had stayed at this hotel as it exceeded my expectation. Reception was helpful, the room was clean and modern. minor cons: A bit cramped and not much space to put our baggages and folded up stroller. No room for a cot or extra bed. Just space to move around. The room tv (flat screen on the wall) was not working, but called reception and soon after that a repair guy came up and adjusted the wiring. considering it was already night time, i was grateful someone came to help and i get to watch live Oscar coverage! no free wifi. There was a window but the view was the service area. ie: no view. away from Rome hotspot making walking back and forth to Spanish Steps/Colloseum far. But termini is near therefore the underground. pro: convenient location. easy to walk to and from termini entrance. theres cheap kebab shops on the way from termini, internet cafe nearby to print stuff (our flight bookings) and surf the internet (cheaper than the hotel rates obviously) and there are restaurants in front of the hotel with friendly owners. love the room simple, clean lines and modern design. Felt safe at night even with a baby (practice your street smart and tough face. im very petite 5'2 and noone bothered me while i wait for hubby by the internet cafe near termini at 9pm). the size of the room is minor as all i wanted was a clean bed to lie down. i got that plus a decent bathroom and 4 plump pillow unrequested! (see photo) ps: based on hotel website photos, there seems to be other room designs available.

If I have known, I will go out then come back to work in the hotel in the afternoon. Monday morning, constant banging started at 5am, not too sure where the noise came from. It was annoying however it only impacted me for an hour as I planned to get up at 6am. Room assigned is an old room, besides the TV, all things were dated. I booked the hotel via agoda website and would appreciate if it tells its customers that the hotel is currently going through renovation. If I knew, would not book myself there as I know I need to work some part of the weekend. Further, in my opinion this is more ike a 3 star rather than a 4 start hotel given the room I was in. The pictures shown on agoda are those renovated rooms. Not sure how many of those available.", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat service, good value for money.\u201d", "Author": "loujerry", "ReviewID": "UR94923693", "Content": "We have just left the hotel after 3 days in Rome.

We noticed that the ceiling was made out of metal; high humidity and metal don't mix well. Of course there was some notable rust that had been painted over, but it was starting to show again. Also the shower drain had rust on it.

Not suitable to call it a 4 star hotel by any standards. Service is too bad. Shower does not work. Bed is creeking. Rooms were not made up until 3pm. We totally feel that Ariston hotel staff was involved in the theft & it is a syndicate. When they have installed CCTV cameras then why they are not opening it or showing it to us. We presented them with Police report which they asked for & gave them all details but they refuse to take any responsibility or help us in anyway. We gave them a claim letter to claim it from their insurance company since the theft took place in their hotel lobby but they have not taken any action so far.

Just TINY.....The TV was a 13 in one. The queen sized bed is really a combined of 2 twin beds and the mattresses are horrible. You could feel the springs are poking you throughout the night. The shower room, although with a nice glass door, is very tiny for even a 5'3\" and 110 lbs person -- me. I actually bumped to the wall a few times a got myself a nice bruise as a souvenir.

Before booking I think it is important to be aware of the range of rates they offer. According to the reviews on Tripadvisor, the experience of staying on the unrenovated first and second floor or staying on the renovated 4th floor can be like staying on different hotels. We booked a triple executive room on the 4th floor and the first impression was a bit dissapointing as they gave us two proper double beds and the third was a single extra added bed. We thought it wasn\u00b4t what we paid for and complained to reception, they ended up saying that there is no really such triple room in the hotel and that this room could host up to 5 according to the layout, erm...well, I think that is too many people in a room but... It happened that the extra bed was quite comfy and the room was spacious so I didn't mind having it. The general feeling of the room, corridor and lobby is quite contemporary. There is a nice use of colour throughout the hotel and touches of modern materials such as plastic, glass and metal. We had a nice LCD tv with hundreds of channels, security box, and a small fridge with drinks included on the price and replenished everyday. The bathroom in red and green was very clean and well stocked of toiletries and towels although a bit revealing (visually and aurally, if you know what I mean... ) so you better have no secrets with the other guests... The air con was a blessing and worked to perfection during the hot weekend. The noise outside the hotel, however can be an issue if you are hosted in the lower floors, also don't forget to close the shutters as the light may wake you up too soon. The breakfast was also better than I had anticipated, if you don't mind having powder juice and the same stuff three days in a row that is. I used to have a bacon butty, some cheese and cold meats, fruit and yogurt, we missed some eggs to be fair. About the Termini area, the hotel is two minutes from the station and a half an hour stroll from the main turistic atractions. If you like walking you'll be fine, and if you opt for public transport you have tube on the doorstep, many buses lines and an eight euro ride will take you anywhere. Late at night, the area can turn a bit seedy, but apart from a transvestite pinching my friend's nipple on our way back to the hotel and the feeling of somebody following your footsteps, it was all fine... but I wouldn't go on my own late at night. Our rate included being greeted and collected from the airport, wi-fi and also some sort of cocktail that we never had. The staff was nice at reception and at the restaurant so very happy overall.

During our a recent trip to Italy, my husband and I needed a hotel to sleep in for 1 night before our flight back home. Florence was the last city we visited during this trip but we had to go back to Rome the night before, as our flight was leaving from there. As we were going to be in Rome for literally 12 hours only, we thought we'd book a hotel near Termini station. I selected this hotel based on the okay reviews on Tripadvisor. I figured it's 12 hours, we'd be sleeping most of the time, so how bad can it be? Well, very bad indeed. After we checked in, we were showed to our room, a tiny box which had no ventilation whatsover. After unpacking we tried to turn on the heating/aircon and found it was not working. I called the front desk and advised them that there was no ventilation in the room, and that the heating/aircon was not working, and could they please send someone up to take a look at the unit. The woman at the front desk insisted that \"it's working\" - I assured her it was not - she kept insisting, I kept telling her it wasn't. Finally she relented to sending someone from maintenance to have a look. After fiddling around with the switch for 20 mins., the maintenance guy confirmed that the unit is indeed not working. He said he was going to go into the other room and see if the issue was a switch. Fine. 30 mins later he has not returned. I called the front desk again and asked them where the maintenance guy was, as by this time we were suffocating in the room (opened the room door). She said she was going to look for him, but that she knows that the unit is working. Once again I told her that it was not working and maintenance guy was actually going to find out what the problem was. Anyway, an hour later after much frustration, I got maintenance guy - who eventually came back up to our room - to confirm with his colleague that the unit indeed was not working. He left and we were left there with no ventilation. I called front desk and asked to be moved to another room since we cannot stay in this one. They said they will call me back. About half an hour later they still haven't called back so I called again - this time extremely frustrated - and it was only then that she said fine, we'll change your room. We were then shown to another room, which had a working heating/airconditioning. After we unpacked again, we noticed a really bad sewer smell coming from the bathroom. We checked the bathroom, it was fairly clean but had this horrible sewer smell. At this point it was late in the night, we needed to sleep and so we just decided to keep the bathroom closed the whole night instead of moving again. The bed linens were clean but for some reason had a bad smell to them. The next morning when we had to take showers we noticed that there was no door to the shower!!! It looked like there was one previously but was taken down. So water from the shower got everywhere in the bathroom when you took a shower. Needless to say, our stay at this hotel was an aboslute disaster. I am writing this review so that other people don't make the same mistake I did.

Not clear if this was an issue w/ the on-line booking (I think they booked thru booking.com). So, before you get the key to your room, ask that it have a window facing the street, and know what you paid for. In terms of the meeting space, the room was initially set up incorrectly (again, not clear whose fault that was). The room was on the 6th floor, and leaked during particularly heavy rains. The breakfasts were great, the best we had in Italy. The daytime front desk staff were particularly helpful and warm, made arrangements for dinners, tours, inquired about our experience afterwards. All of the staff we encountered tried their best to be helpful, even if their command of English limited them.

I booked this hotel a couple of months in advance having read a number of positive reviews. I had seen warnings that the hotel was under renovation and to request a room on the 5th or 6th floor (the recently renovated section) which I did and was assured my room \"would be as appears on our website\". We flew into Ciampino Airport and decided to use the Shuttlebus service which brings you to Stazione Termini near the centre of Rome for a very reasonable 8 euro each. Comfortable and spacious, we did not have to wait to long for departure and were able to enjoy a view of the Roman outskirts on our way in. Hotel Ariston is located on Via Filippo Turati, a mere 5 minute stroll from the Stazione Termini. This is great as it means not only are you close to some major local attractions (the Fora, Colleseum, etc. are all within walking distance) but for those trips a little further afield (or when you're just too tired to walk!) you are conveniently located near the main bus terminus and train station. On arrival, we were greeted by an English-speaking receptionist who booked us in and took our passports (a firsty in my travels - experience to date involves a photocopy taken of the passport or swipe of the credit card but our passports were retained for the duration of our stay). As requested, we had a room on the renovated 5th floor. First impression was \"small\" but once the luggage was packed away and we'd settled in it was more than adequate. There were two very comfortable double beds with plenty of pillows, a table and some very modern \"arty\"-type chairs. The room was air-conditioned but nothing beats a bit of fresh air - our double windows opened onto the front of the hotel which did not afford amazing views and when open let in a lot of noise (but Rome is a very noisy city and I'm not sure if any centrally-located hotel can avoid this problem). In terms of in-room facilities, there was a safe (quite reassuring if you're carrying large amounts of cash), a small refridgerator (complimentary soft-drinks and water restocked everyday), a kettle and small selection of herbal tea, and a large flat-screen TV with nly 1 or 2 English-speakinhg channels (although on the last day of our stay a Sky satellite box was installed in the room). If the bedroom was cosy, the bathroom was spacious. Very modern and comfortable, the \"arty\" feel is taken to a new level here with see-through glass doors to both the bathroom and shower. This was a little off putting as it reduced privacy quite a bit! The hotel bar is comfortable and ideal for chilling out after a long day of sight-seeing. A very limited selection of beer is available and quite to my own disappointment the largest volume a Guinness comes in is 330mls! So much for a pint of the black stuff! There is a range of wine also. Prices were reasonable enough and the service prompt. The dining room opens only for breakfast, served between 7 - 10.30 am. A large selection of food is available. Cereal, bread, cheese, smoked ham, scrambled eggs and bacon, fruit salad, yoghurts, pastries, juices and teas (fond of herbal teas I was delighted with the huge range available!). The best part is breakfast is included in the price of your stay and is buffet-style so you help yourself and can take as much as you like. Ideal for filling up before a long day of touring the city. There is also a roof garden which has seen better days although some work was being carried out on it during our stay. The hotel seems to be still undergoing renovation and improvement (as mentioned, the installation of the satellite box during our stay). The one negative impact this had on us was the like-clockwork noise at 6am every morning as work on the building began. The noise above our room could be likened to that in a bowling alley. That said, by day 2 it had been referred to as the \"wake-up call\" and quickly became this - Rome is best travelled early in the morning before the hordes venture out. All-in-all, a very pleasant stay in a comfortable and reasonably priced hotel. There were no hidden extras - we payed what we expected - and if at times it was a little noisy or untidy, I could forgive it as it was all in the sake of improvement. ne final piece of advice which has nothing to do with the hotel but may help first-time visitors to Rome: be cautious with some restaurants as there are often \"hidden\" prices included. We found out the hard way that most places charge you a couple of euro for bread, water and table service before you've even ordered anything! And one place that really left us with a bad taste in our mouths charged us 7 euro for a plate of chips (and this was no fancy 5-star diner!). So read the menus and feel free to decline water or bread if you're not interested. That said, the place just across from the hotel is a good spot for nice food, fast service and low cost.

All in all,for the price and 30 euro more, the Ariston delivered what in my opinion is probably the best value I've ever received in a Euro hotel.", "Date": "July 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cHotel From Hell Part Two\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5288513", "Content": "We booked tyhe Ariston Hotel because the Hotel Morgana, where we had a wonderful stay, was full on our return leg to Rome from Florence for our last few days in Italy prior to heading home to Manila.

Plus, it prominently advertised that it was a wi-fi hotspot, which meant we had wireless internet access from the rooms. We were all upbeat upon checking in since we had just come from a rustic tuscan-villa experience which was romantic and old-world to say the least, but we were already yearning for some modern day conveniences already. Little did we know what was in store for us. The lady at the front desk when we were checking in must have thought she was god's gift to humanity. Never have I encountered such rudeness and lack of respect in any other place, regardless of country. If I were not a devout catholic then I probably would've ended up in a jail cell that night for assault and battery. And then the bellhop...he was complaining about how our bags made his hands red, even after a thirty euro tip! Is a thirty euro tip not enough? Imagine the nerve of that guy. And then we were told that the airconditioning was out for the whole building but would be fixed in the morning. Morning came and still no airconditioning. We had to fight with the same rude people at the front desk to get one of the three rooms we booked airconditioned. We were too tired fom almost a month of travel around europe to fight anymore.

After having read a number of reviews, it seems that one\u2019s personal experience in relation to other hotels greatly shapes their opinion. We stayed at the Visconti Palace and Jolly Villa Carpegna, which were not as centrally located, but infinitely better in terms of service, value and room quality. Here\u2019s why: Our room was ridiculously small and the AC didn\u2019t work, a common problem based on the other reviews I\u2019ve read (and a major headache if it\u2019s at all hot outside). We had reserved a double bed and after calling the front desk on it, they were aware a mistake had been made; they just didn\u2019t tell us about it until we complained!!! We instead received a room with a single bed and a cot. The bathroom was adequate. There\u2019s obviously a huge discrepancy in room size, common throughout older hotels in Italy. No joke, our bathroom was just slightly smaller than our room. Breakfast was inadequate and lacked imagination, again common throughout the hotels we stayed at in Italy. Despite the prior complaints (with the exception of no AC) this would all have been tolerable given the price. However my and my wife\u2019s main complaint regards the staff. I can only speak as an American/Canadian and I realize that several nationalities are represented, but.....There is no service with a smile at Hotel Ariston (with the exception of the breakfast staff, which was helpful and prompt). In fact, if you are from the US or Canada, don\u2019t expect anything close to what we are used to anywhere in Italy. Things may get done, they may not, and never expediently. And if you do ask for something, be prepared to feel as if you are annoying them. The world is filled with antipatici/--- and in Italy they seem to be concentrated in the service industry. I can speak frankly about this because I speak Italian, yet feigned ignorance to hear what loose lips will utter. I won\u2019t get into specifics but let me say there\u2019s a lot of poking fun and talking behind people\u2019s backs. The point is this: when you spend your --- hard earned money, which they are only happy to take, you don\u2019t need or want any attitude from anyone except for \u2018yes sir\u2019 and \u2018right away sir\u2019. That\u2019s it. If somebody wants to compare, stay at a hotel in Las Vegas or any major US or Canadian city and see what service is. Needless to say, we felt ripped off. I could expound further, but I think I got my point across. My advice: don\u2019t stay anywhere in this area near the Termini because it is, essentially, a tourist trap with crappy, overpriced restaurants. If money is not an issue, stay in more modern hotels that have more uniformity in terms of room size and spaciousness. If money is an issue, I guess you could chance it or stay at a hostel where you don\u2019t expect service.

The Ariston turned out to be a good choice. It's a tastefully decorated place, very close to the Termini station. The room was definately a case of form over function though - the mood lighting wasn't really bright enough, and the glass shower stall managed to leak water all over the bathroom floor, the toilet was just that little bit too close to the wall and so on. The biggest omission was a writing desk of some type - there wasn't really anywhere to empty your pockets, or write a travel diary. It was a bit small too - we had two bags, and managed to keep tripping over them. That said, noise wasn't a problem (double glazing + shutters). You could hear the street below, but it wasn't intrusive. Air conditioning was included in the price, but it took a while to take the heat out of the room. The included breakfast was the best we had at any hotel in Italy. Mostly a European style buffet (breads, cheeses, croissants, cereals, fruit and so on), they had bacon and eggs too if you felt like something hot. The best thing about this hotel were it's staff. As our flight was too early for the airport train we asked if they could arrange a shuttle for us. They offered to box up some breakfast for us to eat on the way! We ended up with a Mercedes, leather seats and driver for about \u20ac10 more than our two-year old guidebook said a taxi should cost. A nice way to end the holiday. The area around the hotel is a bit rough around the edges, but it's not a ghetto or anything. The restaurants in the immediate vacinity aren't much (too touristy), but we did enjoy Leonetti's, a couple of blocks further back from the Termini, and to the right. You're not exactly going to be walking out of the hotel and into the major sights. The Colesseum is around 20 minutes away, and would be the closest of the majors to the hotel. Still, the metro and buses are close by at Termini if you don't feel like walking. At \u20ac170/night through an online booking service I can't say it's great value, but for Rome in May it's probably about as good as you're going to find.

I did not have high hopes because the area around the station is quite seedy. Well, Ariston is an oasis in the desert of gross looking hotels around Termini. Just from the front door you can see that it is not a worn out, smelly place. The lobby is spacious and nicely decorated, and the room was very nice looking, clean, and had no smoke smell (I was concerned because I had not requested a non-smoking room, not realizing how essential this is in Italy). Desk staff was friendly, and it really is a block from the station. Exit Termini where the taxi stand is, go straight one block, make a left, and it's right there. I had no trouble wrestling my wheeled-but-still-heavy bag to and from the station. Because the area is not great (though not dangerous, I don't think), I don't know if you'd want this to be your home base for a visit to Rome, although you can catch any bus and the metro at the station so in that sense it's an easy location to start from. But if you are in my situation of wanting to be near the station for ease of getting to the airport, this is an excellent choice. The price on the room door was E170, I paid E100.
