{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Misled by Emerald Tulamben (Bali) website This hotel sounded lovely for our purposes during a trip to Bali.Our main goal was a place to snorkel right from the shoreline of the hotel, as opposed to going out on day boats and tours.We worked to find a hotel with air conditioning, and the best creature comforts we could find in the main dive site area of Bali: Tulamben. (Many dive sites appropriately cater to younger, less affluent guests. When we were younger, we went to those types of places. But we are now in late middle-age, and really want to be comfortable.)From their website, Emerald Tulamben Beach sounded great.When we arrived, we were the only occupants of the hotel -- quite spooky. We were told three other rooms would be occupied later that day.Our room's temperature was still over 80 degrees F after the air con was on for several hours.The stairs and ladders down to the water were broken and even missing in certain spots, making it extremely dangerous (and in some spots, impossible) to access the water.This hotel, in its extremely beautiful location, needs some major refurbishment to meet the standards implied by its website.On the good side: Excellent food (we were the only ones in the restaurant, of course); very nice staff, as in most places in Bali; a FANTASTIC ride from Denpasar up into the hills along the rice paddies of Bali's east coast.We hope this hotel will improve in reality -- and in its portrayal of itself on the internet.", "Date": "Jul 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR880076774", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SnorkelFromBeach"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469406-d308780-r17830873-Emerald_Tulamben_Beach_Hotel-Tulamben_Bali.html", "HotelID": "308780", "Price": "$180"}}
