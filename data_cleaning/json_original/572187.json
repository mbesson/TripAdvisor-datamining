There is an excellent sweet pastry shop around the corner. The hotel is a stone throw from the tram line, which I took on recommendation of the hotel staff. It is easy enough to buy coupons. I travelled several times on the tram to the Spice Market, to the opposite coast, to dinner, to a hamami, and to the Grand Bazaar. The highlights were my Turkish bath at the Cagaloglu hamami (what a treat!) and the visit to the spice market - where one can buy tea, sweets, coffee, pastries, etc. And make sure to eat at the world famous Pandeli restaurant at the spice market. Restaurants are good, street stalls are great for fresh juice, tea or Turkish coffee & pastries.

The hotel is not near many sites, but the neighborhood seemed safe with quite a bit of non-touristy shopping available very nearby. The public transportation system was within 1/2 block and likely would have taken you wherever you may need to go. Since this stay was unintentional and only overnight I did not futher explore that option. The breakfast buffet was very extensive with coffee, tea, juice, two soups, many cheeses, cold meats, cereal, jams, pastries, bread, eggs, potatoes, and a few other items that were supposed to be warm. My only real complaint would be that the staff in the breakfast buffet area seemed less than pleased to be working there and the food items that were supposed to be hot were cold and most items that were supposed to be cold were warm.

This hotel is right between tram stops, although we walked into Istanbul each day; there is a little bar down the street a little towards Istanbul which had a live quartet of musicians playing turkish music and the staff were both friendly and welcoming; as two ladies travelling on our own we thought we might be hassled, but we found everyone absolutely charming.

It may be difficult to reach this hotel by public transport to and from the airport. Although it is near a frequent tram stop, the trams are sometimes very packed so luggage might be difficult. As others have mentioned, there's nothing much to do in the immediate vicinity. Breakfast was good and had lots of variety, though the \"hot food\" didn't look appetising. Usually fresh butter was served over ice. On 2 mornings we had small packets of butter which smelled of and tasted like blue stilton! However the hotel is used by large tour groups so if you come down after a group has been through ie. after 7.30pm there may not be much left. The restaurant food was repetitive mass catering with \"hot food\" sometimes served cold. On one occasion half our group sent their main meal back. They only serve meat, no fish. For our last meal they did make an effort, and it was better, but I guess they can get away with lower standards where there is a fast turnover of customers. The \"no smoking\" policy was generally but not always enforced. The only alcohol served was beer which appeared to be relatively low in alcohol.
