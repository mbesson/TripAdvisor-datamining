I don't have a personal favourite hotel in Paris, but I try to find a hotel in a convenient location. That normally means close to a metro station on the line that takes me to my meeting place the quickest way. Of course the quartier should be nice as well, with a good choice of restaurants close by. This time, I was looking for a place close to Tour Montparnasse. On Google maps, I found this hotel and it did provide the basic needs for a business stay: bed, shower, desk and internet connection. I got lucky this time, because this hotel is very nice indeed, great value for money. It is not your standard cubboard type of Parisian room, but both bedroom and bathroom were quite spacious. They serve a nice, but fairly basic, breakfast buffet and you can order your coffee freshly brewed. The location is just great. Metro station close at hand and the Montparnasse area is nice and lively, certainly if you are there as a tourist. Rue Daguerre and the surrounding streets have plenty of restaurants to choose from. One thing though, what is it with French hotels and the showers? They seem to have invented a different holding system for the shower head for each hotel in the country and more than half are just not working properly. All in all great value for money, friendly and helpful personnel, nice rooms and a perfect location to discover the city.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spain", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, good location\u201d", "Author": "francophilesSpain", "ReviewID": "UR121800091", "Content": "We were impressed with this hotel.

On our night of arrival the man on night duty gave us a very good recommendation for a reasonably priced restaurant only a couple of streets away and was very helpful providing us with tips on what to see etc. I feel that most Paris hotels overstate their proximity to train stations, so when it says it is very close this is actually more like 10-15 minute walk, including crossing a couple of roads, which is a bit cumbersome with suitcases but wasn't too much hassle really - you just keep expecting to see it as you leave the station which makes the journey seem a bit longer!

We had contemplated getting an apartment, but decided on this hotel and wished we had gone with the apartment for various reasons, the most being the ability to cook our own dinner as dinner expenses added up quickly. Breakfast would have been better to buy as well as the markets are great. Location - ok. Closest Metro stop is Gait\u00e9 on Avenue Main, which we found we had to transfer trains a lot more than the Denfert-Rochereau stop at the top of the street. Train station (Denfert-Rochereau) was farther and if you are not packed lightly, it's not a fun walk, otherwise the walk would be fine. Markets and bakeries on this street are great. Try the Denfert Cafe for dinner - prix fix menu - very good. Down the street a bit is rue Gait\u00e9 where you can find a cafe for happy hour drinks (although still 5 EU for a draft beer) and some good restaurants. In this area, (not on this street) is Moules Frites restaurant - good value for your money. Hotel - Old - needs upgrading. Smelly/stale air as no a/c. Noisy rooms at front. We had to switch rooms half way through due to noise because we had to keep window open for air. Our fridge in that room didn't work and, because it was the weekend, nobody could fix it for us. Spoiled the cheese we had purchased. Very small rooms, although the one on the ground floor was a little bigger than our original on the 1st floor. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast is way too expensive - bakeries down the street are better. OK hotel, but wouldn't recommend for more than 3 days. General Tips - Weekly Metro pass is well worth it. SHARE a photo session for 4 EU (4 pics) as you will need a pic for the pass or bring your own from home. The space is only about 3/4\" square. Museum Pass was worth it for us to save on entry fees, although not one place even looked at the expiry date. Also, not sure if it was timing or what, but we only got to bypass the queue at Musee D'Orsay. Still had to get in line everywhere else for security reasons. Eiffel Tower - we pre-booked our elevator time - worth it as there was a 2-hour wait for the elevator to go up. You are on your own to come down though, so keep that wait in mind when you're up there.

The staff was super nice and accommodating, and even printed our airplane boarding passes for us, which was extremely helpful! And they all spoke English, which is really helpful for English-speaking travelers like myself. They also had lots of helpful traveling and tourist information/pamphlets to pass on, if you needed it. The location was great too, as there were several restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries, and even a bank, all located on the same street. And the hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the Metro.

They blamed it on mosquitos, saying it couldn't be bed bugs, we have both travelled plenty to know the differnece between the two bites, and when we asked for spray they didnt have any because they \" havent heard of the hotel having bed bugs before\". After this there was no apology, making it worse. However they did move us to another room, which in the end didnt have any bed bugs, and we learnt not to use the extra blanket/pillows! However, on the last night we smelled cigarette smoke quite strongly, even though the bathroom door/room door/windows were all shut, there was no extraction fan for the smoke to seep in, and there was no smell in the hallway, so the only thing it could have been was coming from the room below, and someone making its way into the room.

This is promised on the website - but it turned out to be fraud, because the WIFI connection does not work on the top floor, where my shoebox single room was located. And the receptionist didn't ever bother to apologize, on the contrary she implied that it was my own fault for having booked a single room. And I do speak a passable French, so it was not a question of communications problems. Consequently I had to carry laptop, recharger etc. down the to lobby, where there is no comfortable workspace for using your laptop. And moreover, if you want to use the hotel lobby stationary PC instead you will have to PAY for an access card ! I have stayed in many budget hotels in Paris, so I am used to small rooms, but this one was outrageous. I cannot imagine what it would be like to stay here for 2-3 weeks, also considering the 50x50 cm closet you had for storing your clothes. In the morning I had the chance to peep into other rooms during cleaning, and they were much more comfortable. They had simply given me the worst room in the whole hotel - and I paid 550 euros for 7 nights. Single rooms in Parisian budget hotels like this one (which certainly deserves no more than max 2 stars) are currently obtainable for about 58-63 euros. Funny thing is that I had asked about the size of the room in an email to the hotel, and had the reply \"15 m2\". They must have some pretty small m2's in Paris to be able to cram 15 m2 into my room,, because according to my calculations the room was no more max 9 m2. This I also explained to the female receptionist, but she couldn't care less. As you may have discovered, the main problem with this hotel is their attitude towards the customers. Another peculiarity: On arrival I found towels plus a washcloth in my (very clean) bathroom. How nice, but then again - it should be expectable in a 3 star hotel. But the next day there was no new washcloth, so I asked for one in the reception. Same problem next day - the maid had not given me a clean washcloth. So I went to the reception yet again, and this time I had the explanation, that I was only supposed to be given ONE ! One washcloth for a full week is a tad below my hygienic standards, I must admit. After I had met the maid in the stairs and explained directly to her about the washcloth issue, I ended up getting a new one each day - but I suppose that equalled to being upgraded to DeLuxe. In all fairness must be added the 4 positive traits of the room: Free view to the north, postcard pretty, of Montmartre and Sacr\u00c3\u00a9 Coeur Bathroom cleanliness Mini-fridge Firm matress I cannot recommend this hotel, because you can do much better with your money in Paris - and giving false information on the website is simply unforgiveable.

The hotel is quite close to everything, so position is not too bad. basically paris is lovely but i wouldnt return to this hotel again.", "Date": "August 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alloa,Scotland", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5357748", "Content": "Four of us stayed here in twin rooms on a two night break this was our first time in Paris. The hotel was well presented,albeit small,but somewhere clean to put your head down at night,with an excellent breakfast to see you through the day.However,the rooms we were in do need some new furniture,e.g dressing table and chair are a bit the worse for wear,we did get a new carpet the day we arrived though. The hotel is just round the corner from the metro and the montparnasse tower,we went to the very top of the tower for spectacular views of Paris. Some reviews point out that the hotel is too far from the centre of Paris,however,we suggest that you sus out the metro as we did therefore,getting around was a breeze.We also bought a metro travel 3 day pass,excellent value and saves waiting in a que to get tickets.

The great things about the hotel was the clenliness of the rooms and showers which is the most important point for me when staying in a hotel. The beds were changed daily and we could not fault the very helpful staff. The wired thing that happened was the battery in our safe went leaving us without lots of things overnight and halfway thru the next day. TV volume only goes to a certain volume so can be difficult to hear during the day time. The metro is close by and easy to navigate around. I have stayed in other hotels in paris where the streets were noisy at night but this one was quite. The walls are a bit thin which can be uncomfortable when the idiot upstairs wants to fall asleep with his tv on. I did call up and advise him it was in his healths best interests to keep quite so it was fine in the end. The room was very small but overall the hotel is fantastic for someone looking for a nice clean room whith helpful staff and many shops etc on your doorstep.", "Date": "May 25, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Montparnasse Daguerre", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d600333-Reviews-Hotel_Montparnasse_Daguerre-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$99 - $179*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">94 rue Daguerre</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">14th Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75014</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "600333", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e1/7a/e17a745b6b7923bee62fb6a120173e8e7large.jpg"}}
