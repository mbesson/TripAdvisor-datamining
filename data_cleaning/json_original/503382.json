Also, there was an envelope on the desk asking us to leave money for our housekeeper . Are you kidding me!? Next was the continental breakfast....we read online that they served scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage as well as cold cereal. Come to find out...there was nothing hot served except a waffle that you had to wait several minutes in line to have the lady make or you had to make it your own. This place had the same things every morning and the juice was horrible! Another thing we were disappointed in was the noisy atmosphere. Every night we couldn't sleep either because there were young kids screaming and yelling at 3 am or because the person next door was yelling and screaming at their partner. We were just very disappointed in what we experienced on our stay there. It was nothing like it looked or had online. The one good thing was that it did offer free wireless internet.

The next day when we got back housekeeping never came to our room but it was so late ( midnight) that we just let it go, besides the office was closed anyway. Then the next morning at 9 am housekeeping walks into our room without knocking and says that he didn't have our room as being rented.

We were locked outside with our 22 month old son and had our dog locked inside due to stuck hardware in the mechanism. They were unable to unlock it and had to break the lock out after drilling it with a hole saw to get in (did I mention my dog is terrified of power tools and extreme noise like this?). This took over 1 1/2 hours, completely ruining our evening plans and on time arrival at them. We were then moved into a different room. I moved all of our stuff over to it (staff offered to help, but didn't want our personal items handled). Then on the evening of the 4th at about 11:30 p.m., after spending 1 1/2 hours in traffic trying to get back to our room after watching fireworks, we returned to find the lock on the new room wouldn't read either of our key cards. I had to go to the office (which was closed) and call an emergency number on there while my wife, very tired son, and dog waited. Then we had to wait over 20 minutes for the manager to open the door with his key card. The manager tried to say the next day that the lock batteries were low was why it didn't work (yet his card did???), however I had the desk clerk check the cards, and he said they had no information on them, leading me to believe when the manager did activate them for the new room, he didn't activate them long enough for them to work the remainder of our stay. It was obvious maintenance upkeep isn't a big concern at this place due to rotted railings near the office, old looking rooms, and even no grout in the tile back trim in the bathrooms.

We told the desk clerk this and she just looked at us like she thought we were crazy. 2nd - the continential breakfast. We didn't feel it was as good as usual but it wasn't bad. However, the lady that prepared it (named Helen - I think) was a nuisance! She was in the way - everywhere you turned. You couldn't get your food because she wouldn't get out of the way.
