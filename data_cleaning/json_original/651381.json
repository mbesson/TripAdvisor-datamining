I loved the loaction of the hotel as it is right next to the big shopping centre so plenty of shops close by, there is also some nice restaurants and cafes close by the hotel which are great to relax in during the day or on the way back to the hotel in the evening as they are quieter and more relaxing than in the city centre. The best thing about the hotel was our room, we had a superior room which was really spacious and had lots of luxury comforts. The bathroom was huge with a great shower and bath and lots of nice toiletries. The room was always kept clean and was really modern. We only used the Spa once, we had free entry with the deal but I think normal entry price is in the region of \u20ac15 which I think is a bit much to expect guests to pay to simply use the steam room and sauna. I did however get a manicure and pedicure when there and the girl who did them was fantastic, spent lots more time than required with me and was extremely friendly and tried making conversation despite the language barrier. It was a very enjoyable experience and decent value too. We ate in the hotel restaurant one evening. We went down quite late and the restaurant was pretty much empty and lacked any character. The meal was ok but much better quality to be found outside the hotel. If I didnt have the voucher I would not have been very happy paying for the food given the quality and lack of ambience. The hotel bar is also kind of quiet and lacks any atmosphere. The staff in the hotel could be a little bit better in the area of customer service. The front reception is painfully slow and they seem a litte uninterested, same can be said for staff in the restaurant and bar. All in all the hotel has good facilities, is clean and spacious and offered us exactly what we wanted for the beginning of our trip.

What is more, it offered both a bathtub and a shower, something rare for a 4 stars hotel. Breakfast buffet was rich both in quantity and quality. Something worth mentioning was the fact that omelletes were not premade, but were prepared only when asking for. The Nhube restaurant, from the other side, was overpriced and the food quantity was really small. Talking about the taste, it didn't make any sense, at least to us. We had much better meals at restaurants in the city. The rooftop pool, although very small, was nice and relaxing. The lack of a rooftop bar, although some could see as a drawback, in my opinion was a plus, as the area was quiet, every time we visited it.

Hotel was easy to get to from the airport and staff were pretty friendly given I arrived on a public holiday. It was also an easy place to access the city as I then moved on to another hotel. My company had organised a meeting at the hotel for 100+ staff and the rooms were all ready on time and appropriate. Okay food given the numbers dictated buffet style for each meal. Good, but not great, stay but certainly have no complaints.", "Date": "October 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Herndon, VA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Modern Business Hotel\u201d", "Author": "2BeachGoers", "ReviewID": "UR18243859", "Content": "Stayed here for 2 days in July 2008. I dont generally write reviews, but I thought it was necessary for this hotel due to the last comments. Style: This is a nice hotel. It is decorated in a very minimalist modern style, lots of glass and concrete. It is very cool if you like that style. If you are looking for a quaint old-world hotel, this is not for you. Rooms: We had a room with two twin beds pushed together to make a king bed, a nice plasma tv, and an air conditioner and door lock that worked. The A/C does take a little while to cool off the room, but give it an hour and it'll be very cold. Our bathroom had a nice soaking tub and a separate shower, very modern - with charcoal gray tile and red glass. They give you bathrobes and slippers plus all the usual shower amenities and a hair dryer. Amenities: Every guest is allowed a 15 minute internet session, with a code they give you at the front desk. There is a nice hotel bar with a lounge and tv's. They also have a great Eurpoean style breakfast with cheeses, meats, breads, and even eggs and sausage. They give you bottles of water and chocolates for the turn down service. There is no concierge/tour desk because it caters more to business travelers, although the front desk is helpful if you are looking for a nearby restaurant or directions. Location: It is a bit far from the subway, maybe 8 blocks or so, it is however located close to the tram and the avenida diagonal. It is a very safe location, next to the police station. We walked back from the subway around midnight on a weeknight and saw other people walking too. I dont know if i'd stay there again due to the location, but if i was visiting a museum closeby or doing business there, I would definitely recommend it.", "Date": "July 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cDepressing architecture\u201d", "Author": "AirVagabond", "ReviewID": "UR17276786", "Content": "Stayed there one night. First room they gave me had an inoperative air conditioner, which the management said was operable \"You just need to give it time to work.\" Nope, it was broken. I finally had to insist strongly that they give me a new room. Even the new room had a broken electronic lock that they had to send maintenance up to reprogram. Architecture is ultra modern, stark and sterile in the extreme, steel, glass, no color, pictures, flowers . . . . inhuman really. Actually depressing. Like it was designed by a robot. This hotel's architecture is the antithesis of the Spanish character of enjoying life, color, style, and beauty The hotel is a long walk to the subway and far from the old city. Overall, I cannot recommend this hotel due to the depressing architecture and location.", "Date": "June 27, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "NH Constanza", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d651381-Reviews-NH_Constanza-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$104 - $206*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">C/ Deu i Mata 69-99</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08029</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "651381", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d0/49/d0491575a4a8b87c22b23222018024f36large.jpg"}}
