The property looks very fresh, in fact it could have received another updated since my last visit. This is the new euro style Crowne Plaza motif. I was upgraded to the executive floor and the corner suite was beyond my expectations. The view of Chicago skyline was wonderful. All the amenities you would expect at a newer Crowne Plaza, robes in the closet, modern clean furniture and large flat screen TV\u2019s. The bed was a bit harder than most Crowne Plaza\u2019s, usually they have those wonderful pillow top beds, not here unfortunately. But the Linens were first class, and the towels soft. The shower even though it was a bath/shower combo, was very nice with ample pressure and hot water. The service was very good, but I get the feeling that it is slightly less if you have an issue, might just be Chicago, or the management. But if there are no issues, it\u2019s very pleasant service. My observation is from listening to others at the front desk. The property is adjacent to the Dan Ryan freeway. When on the balcony it is very noisy on a Friday night. But the sliding window is very effective and one might not know they were near a freeway. This leads me to believe that much of the noise in most hotels come through the wall air conditioner, which this property does not have. It has a much better central built in fan system. Parking is very expensive for being this far from the loop. As of Mar 2012 it is $36 per day for valet parking. There is no self park. A good tip for the cost conscious is to park just to the north of the Walgreens adjacent to the property. Its only $6 per day on Saturday and Sunday. Less than a 100 yard walk. The surrounding area is much improved. It is called Greek Town and has many Greek restaurants. Many offer open windows, one even has a retractable roof. Within 4 city blocks there is traditional Chicago pizza. I observed several woman walking alone at night in the area indicating that it is much safer then it was just a few years ago. The area is now home to several new upscale apartments and is flanked on the north and south side by a Walgreens and Dominick\u2019s stores. It is close enough to the loop to walk safely (1/2 mile), or a easy taxi ride. But if you get in late on a Friday or are there on business there is ample food choices nearby without a car. Its my new choice when the Miracle Mile properties are sold out.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa City, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, and good price\u201d", "Author": "Kieran L", "ReviewID": "UR126036885", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at the Crowne Plaza Metro.

Our room was very large. It had a sitting area with flat screen TV, pull out bed couch and desk and a separate bedroom area with another flat screen TV. There is a coffee machine, Iron, hair dryer and a safe in the room. The bedding is very plush, soft andower. Amazing how you open the balcony door and the raucous buzz of the city invades, but close it and it's quite peaceful. There is also free Internet in your room. The staff here is great. They are very friendly, nice and always want to help your stay in Chicago be it's best. On Wednesdays they host a Wine and Cheese party hosted by two of the staff members. This allows the staff to really get to mingle with the guests and answer any questions they may have. The location is excellent. The blue line train is a couple of blocks away and only cost $2.50 to get to the airport, if you decide to take a cab that is about $40. The hotel is in Greek Town, so there's plenty to do there and plenty of restaurants to eat at. If you do not feel like leaving the hotel Dine is a great place to go. You can either sit in the dining room, that has a fancy menu or sit at the bar which has a bar menu. If you like IPAs my husband loved the local beer Daisy Cutter which they have on tap. If you are planing to see a taping of the Rosie show or attend a game at the United Center- this hotel is perfect for you. There is no pool, but the exercise room was clean and nice.

We booked through orbitz.com which I will warn you, does not always give accurate information regarding \"rules\" around a hotel stay, even when speaking with a person live. Our challenge was to find a nice hotel near United Center as my son who is 20 and his girlfriend had tickets for the Bulls and Hawks games back to back. My son is on a budget and so it was important that there was no high fees for parking. Also since he is 20 we wanted to make sure there were no issues with him checking in. Again, booked through Orbitz who confirmed there were no restrictions on age and also that parking was free. My son arrives at the hotel, calls me very freaked out to find out that first, he has to be 21 to get the room and second, there is only valet parking at a cost of $30 per 24 hours. He handed the phone to the manager, Michael, whom I spoke to and explained the due diligence I did in booking the room, the information received from Orbitz and also that the write up on Orbitz.com listed parking and valet parking indicating there were two options for parking. This situation could have turned out to be a nightmare but Michael exhibited excellent customer service in handling the situation. He asked that I send him an email confirming I would take responsibility for my son and second asked I email the description listed on Orbitz and our reservation regarding no mention of fees with parking. I did both and he not only let my son and his girlfriend get the room, he waived the parking fee for the night. He handled the situation well! My son said the room was great, they ordered room service and learned the hard way how much that cost and had a great night watching the Bulls down the street! Thank you Michael and Crowne Plaza Chicago for making my son's weekend trip wonderful.

This hotel is in Greek town and many very nice restaurants (not all of them are Greek) are very close by. However, it's not very close to the main tourist attractions in downtown Chicago. The rooms are really nicely appointed--the furniture and decor are very up to date and very tasteful. Also, the rooms have really great desks built into the wall that have plenty of room for spreading out while you are working--I think this was probably the best hotel room desk I've encountered so far. In addition, there is not just free WiFi (which gets really slow in the evening due to all the usage) but also ethernet access (and a cable) which was incredibly useful when WiFi got to be slow. The room was very clean, where even the bedspread did not seem questionable, and the room smelled like fresh laundry. The bed was very comfortable as well. The bathroom was also very clean and nicely arranged (lots of counter space) but one thing was that the hardware on the adjustable showerhead was either stuck or not operational at some of the joints. so the showerhead had to be pointed in this weird way for you to use it. Otherwise the bathroom was just fine. One thing about this hotel is that it is very noisy from the highway, especially if you are not used to the traffic. My room was very high up and thus had a great view, but also experienced a lot of highway noise. The noise really is significant, so on the second night I used the earplugs that the hotel supplied, as well as a pillow over my head, and that helped quite a bit. Other amenities include use of the exercise room which has decent equipment, and also a business center with computers and printers. Also, they give away coffee in the lobby in the morning.

Check-in was frustrating; we tried for an early check-in and were told the room would be ready in \"about an hour\" so we wandered to the adjacent grocery store and camped out in the Starbucks there, as a rowdy wedding party had taken over the hotel lobby; upon returning, we were told it would be another \"half hour or so\" and that pattern kept up for a full 4 hours or so... honestly if they'd said it would be 4 hours from the get-go, we'd have gone and done something, not hung around the lobby!

Despite sending the original complaint on June 4 with follow-up on July 26 and August 18, I still have not received what was promised to me. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I recently completed a three-night stay with a large group at the Crowne Plaza Chicago Metro. While I am not a top-tier Platinum PC member, I am a Gold PC member and was disappointed in multiple facets of my stay which I will outline below. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 At check-in, I was assigned to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153King Petite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room (though nothing in my booking indicated such). When I asked if a standard King room was available, I was told that the hotel was completely sold out. This was at 1:30 in the afternoon. A rack of approximately 40 portfolios that had not yet checked-in was clearly visible. Am I to believe that all of those portfolios were higher-level Platinum members, Double rooms and/or King Petites as well? Frankly, it seemed that the desk clerk was too lazy to be bothered. He did offer to exchange my room the next day if something came available. But why wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t program status even considered when making the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room assignments to begin with? \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The room I received was cramped. It honestly felt like a New York City hotel room. Granted the furnishings had been updated but this is a small consolation if the facility itself is uncomfortable. I needed to go out for a couple of hours and stopped by the front desk to reiterate my displeasure after seeing the room. I told the desk clerk that I was not unpacked and would be willing to relocate if there were cancellations. The desk clerk said he would let me know. I asked him if he remembered my name. He did not and then asked for my room number (a sure indication that he intended to do nothing in the first place since he hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recorded it earlier). I was never contacted again by the desk clerk or management. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Climate control in this room was lacking. Despite repeated attempts to adjust the temperature, the room maintained the constant feel and smell of a high school locker room. Notably there is no exhaust fan in the bathroom which likely contributes to this odor. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 I should also mention that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free high speed internet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is anything but high speed. The connection failed constantly, both wired and wirelessly. Fortunately, my smartphone and IPad were able to fill the void where the internet service failed. Of course this meant that I could not send work files from my laptop as needed. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The next morning I awoke to no hot water. I called downstairs to the front desk to inquire. An exasperated operator cut me off mid-sentence. Apparently, there was none for the entire hotel. At least I got to take a cold shower in a small, cramped bathroom. **sigh** The lack of hot water must have had an impact on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s laundry as well. When my room was cleaned for the day, the used towels were removed. However, they were not replaced. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good thing I had one set remaining. The standard provision of three towel sets wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t restored until the following day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cleaning. Oddly enough, a friend who was also staying in the hotel said he received extra towels that day. Perhaps \"petite\" isn't only a reference to the room, but the maintenance of its amenities as well. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 On Saturday evening (approximately 9-9:30 p.m.), I ate dinner at the on-site restaurant. I was alone, was seated in the dining room and given the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bar menu\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (limited late evening offerings). I ordered a simple grilled ham & cheese sandwich with french fries. While waiting, I observed my surroundings. A male-female couple were seated and offered the bar menu as well as the full dinner menu. Another couple (male-male) were seated and offered the limited bar menu. A single male diner was seated and was also given the bar menu. Finally, a group of four (two men, two women) were seated and given the full dinner menu. Must a lady be seated at your table in order to eat from the full dinner menu? I should also note that all four of these tables received their meals before I did. Thirty minutes later, my sandwich and fries arrived; hot but still last in line despite being first to order. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 At check-out, I was greeted by the front desk clerk and asked if \u00e2\u20ac\u0153everything on my bill was o.k.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Indeed, the billing was about the only thing on this stay that was done right. Since the clerk so carefully worded her inquiry and avoided asking me how my stay was, I decided to cut my losses and write this location off as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153never again\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. By now you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re probably asking why I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t engage a manager. Given the multiple areas of failure, it seems that the problem lies at the top of this property\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food chain. Frankly, I felt that I would be wasting my time listening to hollow apologies. Regardless, I am frustrated and angered to the point that I need to let someone know. If you look at my membership file, you will see that I have curtailed my stays at IHG properties considerably, despite logging approximately 100 nights in hotels per year. This is due to the lack of consistency in the IHG brands and indifference to my loyalty. My recent stay at the Crowne Plaza Chicago Metro only reinforces that stance -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I wrote to IHG giving them the opportunity to respond. They of course forwarded my list of complaints to the hotel and had Ron Shelton (Assistant General Manager) contact me. He offered apologies (what else is he going to do?), 15,000 points and an email of apology from the General Manager. Eleven weeks passed with no points nor apology from the General Manager. After emailing IHG twice more, I received 10,000 points from the hotel (5,000 less than originally promised) but still no email from the General Manager. Frankly, these points have no value to me as I have no intent to stay with IHG again. Still, I'm fighting on principle as Crowne Plaza should deliver on its promises. If it weren't for my group having chosen this hotel, I would have stayed elsewhere. Regardless, next year I will stay independently if our group books the same hotel.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201c(half review) Good budget option in Chicago\u201d", "Author": "ChicagoOrange", "ReviewID": "UR117297113", "Content": "First, I was here for a sleep study, so my room was arranged and paid for by someone else, and we were on the lowest floor.

We visited to hotel bar later in the night where the working door man came in multiple times to get drinks and actually made comments about the drinks not being strong enough. Not sure why the bartender would serve someone that was working but that's just me. The next night the same doorman was leaning on the front counter in front of multiple customers making it very awkward for us/ them to get to the front to ask questions or check in. The elevator requires a key to get up to your room which I do like but it would be nice if the key readers worked. I was only able to get up one time out of the five without having to visit the front desk to ask why my card wouldn't work. While in the room they have a lock on the sliding glass door that's great but it only locks when the door is slightly open so I hope you like the sound of the city while you sleep. In addition to that the thing that you would pull the curtains closed with broke off right in my hand. Very cheap! Overall my experience was less than satisfactory.

The king bed was comfy, and the AC worked wonderfully, and the water pressure in the shower was good with HOT water. It was an easy walk from Union Station, but we did take a cab to the El. There was no wait for our car the next morning with valet parking. Yes, you will hear highway noise but we did not hear noise from our neighbors. One of our TVs didn't work, and we did have to call up housekeeping at 2 AM to get the sheets and blankets for the pullout bed. But those weren't deal breakers to us.

Check-in and check-out was smooth and courteous, and when we requested a refrigerator for the room for some medication it arrived very quickly and without charge. The room was comfortable if a little small and had a tiny balcony with views over the city. We had lunch and a drink in the hotel bar/diner attached which was good and had some interesting microbrewery beers. I was a little concerned as to whether the hotel would be noisy as there was (I think) a school prom going on and a big group of partying teenagers in the next room, but I heard no noise at all at night.

I also have a sneaking suspicion that the valet guys didn't simply take my car to the parking lot and maybe did a few errands in it. Can't validate, just some things with my car leads me to this. There was a young valet guy who took my ticket that I was supposed to keep, which made my wait a little longer at checkout. The Bellman took so long bringing up our luggage that we went down to get it ourselves and then as we were getting off the elevator at the Lobby floor he was about to get on with two different luggage carts, neither of which were ours.

We couldn't get the remote to work and the tv is only operated by the remote. the light above the bed was a shower head, the shower curtain was a towel, the bathroom door was a closet/sliding door that kept coming off the track.

When we got back to check-in, the luggage guy couldn't match up the number on our luggage ticket to the number tied around our luggage. How hard is this job? He had everyone waiting for their luggage go in the back room to get it themselves even though it was his paid job to do it 4. We could hear other guests through the vents of our bathrooms. 5. We requested a non-smoking room but the entire hallway wreaked of smoke. 6. They were understaffed. 7. They had a business center but you had to wait in line at the front to let you in - your card did not grant you access 8.

Would I recommend it to a friend? It depends.... If they are doing business in the neighborhood, yes. If they are sightseeing in Chicago - No. If a Gym is important to them - NO (a thousand times NO!) The rooms are nice but if you are in Chicago to sightsee, there are much better choices, much closer to the sights. As I said, the room was fine, the best features were: the very large desk, free (though very slow) wired,or wireless internet, and the nice flat screen TV. The shower head was mounted to an extension arm to provide the 'rain' affect. The ceiling was too low though and the shower head felt like it was nearly touching my head. Nothing else about the room stood out for me. Location, as has been mentioned, is good; especially if you are working in the neighborhood. The MTS station is within a 15 minute walk so there is easy direct access from O'Hare via the Blue Line. I love to walk and though this is a bit far from most of the sites, even the lakefront is only a brisk 30 minute walk. Unless it is raining or bitterly cold, Chicago is a great spot to meander and sightsee. The hotel is located in 'Greek Town', so there are a number of choices for good meals. There are also a number of other restaurant choices within a few blocks - including a nice variety to the west. I had a good meal and quick, friendly service at the bar, even though I had arrived at 9:50PM. The worst part for me was the workout room which is definitely substandard compared to other hotels that I have stayed at in the Chicago area. The ceilings appear to be 7 feet, which in addition to giving a claustrophobic and closet type feeling to the room are so low that when I was on the treadmill I nearly bumped my head. (I'm only 6'2\", but the machine adds 8-10 inches depending on the incline). The equipment was old and worn out and was of especially poor quality for a hotel of this rating. It would be like having a 1985 12\" Emerson TV in the room instead of a flat screen. Speaking of TV's (in the workout room), they are small and have no provision for ear phones, so everyone is pretty much forced to watch the same channel unless you want conflicting audio or no audio. There are only a couple of weight machines and they are also substandard and nearly useless for getting a good workout. There is a good assortment of dumb bells. Obviously the gym is very important to me. I'd rather pay an additional $10/day for a gym that has new, quality, equipment with higher ceilings than have a free gym that is so terrible. Much lesser hotels in Chicago have much nicer gyms; I think that this was an afterthought - stuck in a converted conference room and not really important to the hotel management. Last year I was in hotels nearly 3 nights out of every week. This one did nothing to impress me or standout. The room was probably a B to B+, but for me, it is the whole experience that sets the hotel apart, not just the comfort of the room. I guess I'm weighing the gym's D- grade too heavily, but that matters a lot to me. I paid $180/night and honestly could have stayed in a comparable (or nicer) room with a better gym for $75-$100/night using the 'bidding feature' of a popular website.

It was SOOOO hard trying to decide which hotel location was the best. I was most interested in location rather than price or hotel chain. The Crowne Plaza Metro is wonderfully located for a tourist who wants an all-around experience without leaving the downtown area. It is located on the main \"Greektown\" street which primarily is several blocks of Greek restaurants (sit-down dining and fast food) and residences. On one side of the hotel is a Walgreens and the other side is Dominick's grocery store (subsidiary of Safeway). Sears Tower is about four short blocks away from the hotel in which you cross the Interstate and Chicago River. The hotel parking was $35/night but I parked across the street (west) and paid $20/night. At first, I thought \"Why did I rent a car when I could just take public transportation?\" but then there were a few times I'm glad I had the car to zip around the outskirts. Truly, though, there is no need for a car. The train is very inexpensive from O'Hare to downtown and the bus (Route 20) stops at the entrance of Dominick's and goes all the way to Millennium Park (the huge park next to the lake). One or two blocks south of the hotel Route 124 (or 126?) can also take you to generally the same block over by the park. I made the mistake of driving my car to the Sears Tower and parking in their parking facility. I was slapped with a $31 charge just to park for about 2 hours. Parking everywhere downtown (except for sparsely-available meters) was VERY expensive. It was the only negative about my whole trip. This hotel is clean and new and modern looking even though it's a renovated old structure. It's right next to the Interstate but well insulated so you can't hear noise. Also, there really isn't a perfectly-located room because you're going to see the John Hancock building on one side of the hotel and Sears Tower on the other no matter which room you choose. Every room has a balcony. It's best to go to the Sears Tower Observatory in the late afternoon because of where the sun shines on the buildings, and go in the morning to the John Hancock Observatory because of the same reason. Both observatories give you a different view and perspective. I was glad I took the \"Skyline Cruise\" from Navy Pier because the distant, all-incompassing view of the skyline was really neat. For the river cruise, I simply paid the water taxi price and used that trip to bring my from the Navy Pier back to Union Station where I got off and walked two blocks to the hotel. The river cruise was $30 which was basically narrated, but the one-way water taxi was only $6 for the same route and distance. Lastly, if I return I now know the Hotel Monaco, Hotel 71, or Holiday Inn or Westin right on the Chicago River would be the four I would choose based on price at the time. All four of those hotels seemed like THE BEST location for a second trip. But, the Crowne Plaza was the best for a first trip because I felt right outside of the skyscrapers but only steps away.", "Date": "July 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Louis Missouri", "Title": "\u201cAverage\u201d", "Author": "HonestyCounts", "ReviewID": "UR17416366", "Content": "Nothing special.

It had upscale furnishings including a chaise lounge. It had all the Crowne Plaza sleep amenities and was very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was smallish, but had a very unique sliding glass door (made of frosted glass that you can't see through) which saved room. The faucet and shower heads were not standard but rather very unique and upscale. However, the ceiling to the shower was very low. If you are taller than 6'6\" you may not fit in the shower easily. (Also our double bedded room only had three towels and we had to ask for more). But the best asset of the hotel is its location to some less expensive and very unique dining options in Greek town just one block south of the hotel. There are no less than 15 Greek restaurants and some that are very high class within a three block walk from the hotel. The neighborhood is very safe and you are just a short walk from Union Station and the west side of the Loop.

We did the usual tourist stuff with this as our base--Art Institute, the Shedd, Sears Tower, Mag Mile, Millennium Park, saw \"Wicked\", etc. Felt safe and always oriented. My son pointed out the hotel from the Sears Tower. The hotel itself was simply sophisticated. Upscale, but by no means pretentious. New mattresses. Crisp linens. We liked the neutral colors, granite surfaces, flat screen TV and shimmering view from our balcony. No wireless available in the room, but worked quite nicely in the comfortable lobby.

Any other hotel I have stayed at in Chicago I've been woken up to sirens in the middle of the night, but not here. The highway was just a dull hum. Plus I never heard a door slam, another TV, phone or person, nothing. I never ran into anyone in the hallway. It is quiet. Walgreens drug store and Dominics grocery store were right next door.

I have to say that the only decent staff members I came across were Mitchell the concierge and Paul the bartender who were nice and very helpful. Front desk staff were pretty miserable and the porters have a pretty crafty tip scheme going on. When we arrived the porter lifted our cases out of the cab and put them on his trolley to take up to our room. When we checked in and turned around he had been replaced by someone else. Two tips in five minutes !!!. very sharp guys. But my main gripe was with Jose the duty manager and the car parking guys on the Saturday evening. We had left the hotel in the late afternnon to visit some elderly old friends who live out of town and who we hadn't seen for many years. We had a real nice evening with them and they drove us back to the hotel and we asked them to drop in for a few minutes for quick nightcap On entering the hotel car park there was a sign stating 'Valet Parking Only. My friend gave his car to the valet and we went insidefor a drink. After around 40 minutes they came to leave and when he went to get his car he was asked if he had paid his $10 fee to the front desk. He pleaded ignorance and he didnt know about a fee. It would seem that there is a sign stating the charges but this is very 'conveniently' slightly angled facing in the same direction/away from drivers entering the car park and you would need to look backwards to see it. So you just get out and leave your car and you are caught hook line and sinker. The drivers certainly dont tell you anything about it. (Naughty) I said that I was resident and that they had only been there a very short time. I went into the hotel but had to cough up $10 before they would get him his car. Absolutely Shocking !!! This really upset my old friends and ruined our evening. Once they left I went to the front desk and spoke to the lady on duty. She stated that there was nothing she could do. I asked for the Duty Manager who was a guy called Jose. I explained the positionand suggested he refund the $10 due the our misunderstanding and the way thngs had been done. He said he couldn't and when I pressed the point he said quite strongly that he wouldn't refund it. I then said that we may consider checking out but he couldnt give a damn about that either. His attitude was obnoxious, brusque and downright cocky and not what I would expect from someone in his position. When I completed my comments card on checking out the guy on the desk said that the fee should really have been waived. It transpires that the hotel car park where the main portico stands does not belong to the hotel which I find very strange. Apparantly there is a private company who own it and make the charges.It is $35 to park overnight. That's one whole lotta cash for a few days. So will we stay hear again NO WAY. This hotel needs to give most staff some lessons in customer manners and service. The car park fees should be clearly displayed at the entrance and not craftily angled so that they are very difficult to see.", "Date": "September 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hartford, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cMixed Feelings about Crowne Plaza\u201d", "Author": "AnnGHartfordCT", "ReviewID": "UR8829627", "Content": "Booked room at the Crowne Plaza Metro because The Allegro didin't have any rooms.

We booked the hotel threw Priceline. Originally I was a bit skeptical because it was west of the expressway. However, after arriving in Chicago I was happy with our location and price. Check-in couldn't have been smoother! On the first night we had 2 double bed room on the third floor. They let up upgrade to a king room on the second night on the sixth floor. Both rooms were extremely nice. The ratings say it's a three star hotel. But, I disagree and I would say it's more like 4 stars. On the first night our room was supposedly smoking... but couldn't even tell! An extra plus was the balcony. How many hotels in Chicago have a balcony??? Not many! Service was also great. The bell man bent over backwards for us... or maybe it was our tipping! Great location to Greek town & Little Italy, easy to catch the CTA buses, quick walk to Oprah's studio, and even to Sear's Tower. On the first day we walked all the way to Grant Park to Magnificent Mile and then back to hotel... Which is a long walk... Hence the blisters!

After a nightmare that ended in being bump off the last flight before home, the Crown Plaza was where we were put up for the night. First the shuttle service to and from the airport is great. They have friendly helpful drivers. The bus is clean and comfortable. They make runs back and forth to the airport 24 hours a day at least every half hour. The people at the front desk checked us in very quickly. They knew of course that we had been bumped from our flight and not planning on staying there, and so offered all the help they could. My cell phone had almost died, and I had no way of re-charge it, so one the lady behind the desk gave me her phone charger to use until I had my phone back up. Our room on the fifth floor was lovely. There wasn't anything for a view, but at that point in my day all I wanted was long hot shower and a good night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. Speaking of which, the bed I believe must be fairly new and they were so very comfortable. Four fluffy pillows on each bed [we had room with two doubles], and wrap up in warmth white comforters. In the bath I found the biggest towels I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen in a hotel. You could easily wrap them around with some left over. Ahh\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 All of this lead to good night rest and a much better look out on life at five the next morning when we had to get up to go back to airport.

We came onto Trip Advisor before booking the reservation and saw that the hotel was newly renovated and had updated amenities. We were planning on attending the Taste of Chicago and wanted something that was within walking distance, but was not extremely expensive. We arrived from South Bend, Indiana on the South Shore train at their Millenium station on Randolph & Michigan. We walked about 12-15 blocks to the hotel and it was not a bad walk at all. We didn't want to pay to $2 to get on a bus to the hotel when we were planning on getting the All day pass once we got there for $5. There was lots to see and additional people walking as well so we felt safe. When we arrived we did not wait in a long line and was given our keys within 10 minutes. The room was beautiful. Flat screen plasma tvs, opaque window doors to the bathroom, dimming lights...it was very trendy as a whole. The room was a little small, but for 2 people it was just fine. We were directed by concierge to Dominick's (literally across Madison street) to go and pick up a $5 All Day pass for the buses that you can use for 24 hours after you swipe it for the first time. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! The different buses took us up and down Madison, Michigan, to Grant Park, and to Navy Pier. Buses ran about every 10 mins, which isn't bad. The parking lot next door to the hotel is a great way for friends to park that is cheaper than the hotel parking itself if there are certain events that friends or even you need parking. It is a safe establishment. As a whole our experience was wonderful and made easy. I recommend this hotel to anyone, especially anyone under the age of 30 (since it is such a trendy \"IKEA inspired\" hotel.)

The website states marble bathrooms, which is what most Crowne Plazas have, this just has the standard tiled bathroom, thought the vanity has a kind of cool faucet, which is to the left side and kind of makes it odd when washing your face.
