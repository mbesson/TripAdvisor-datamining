Great view of the Arizona Diamondbacks stadium and downtown Phoenix. There is an outdoor shopping plaza across the street with a number and variety of good restaurants, including a movie theater. There is a good Mexican restaurant there. The only \"miss\" was that morning breakfast room service was delivered lukewarm (cold scrambled eggs, lukewarm ham and soggy wheat toast).

We upgraded to the club level and were given a room just down the hall from the club room. The hotel is probably one of the more upscale hotels in Phoenix and the price does reflect it. It is big and there are a lot of people there, but it never seems crowded. Service for us was good, though we didn't use a lot of the different options. Started right off with the bell service when we drove up. Helpful and offered information on the floors on where we needed to be for the event we were attending. Room and Beds were so comfortable. Club room had very light breakfast starting at 6am - 11am. Free water, coffee, teas and soda's all day. Then at night, they would have a happy hour (3-7pm)with snacks (cheeses and different finger foods), but wine and beer were extra. There was always an attendant in the room. Lobby was a nice comfortable place to just sit and read to get away from the events happening on the convention floors. There are a lot of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. One thing I will comment on because I didn't not find it any references to cost of parking, because it was not included in our room rate. Parking (This is a downtown hotel, were parking is limited) is $17/night for self parking, but what is nice it is in a secure area under the hotel.

I stayed in the standard king bedroom. In my opinion, compared to other hotels I the room it self was smaller than most but the bathroom was larger than most which made up for it. The bed it self was comfortable and the desk was great work space; although I didn't use the desk for internet ( $15/perday). There is a cyber cafe in the lobby with free internet access. I was there on business but I did have a ton of time outside of meetings to check things out. which leads me to location. I was able to walk to the museum, the Suns stadium, Chase field, and Pizzeria Blanco ( a definite must ) all from the hotel. The concierge was great with giving direction for all us directionally challenged folks. The hotel is also in good proximity to public transit if that's your mode of transportation. Additionally, pedal taxi as well as the traditional taxi are easy to flag down. The overall customer service was really excellent. I called the front desk 3 times( for a bottle opener, a new light bulb for the lamp, and once for room service )during my stay and every request was met in record time. One thing that I found interesting was the going \"green\" initiative. You can but a placard outside your door that says that housekeeping does not to change change your sheets.As incentive for more people to do that they give $5 voucher to the hotel restaurant. So I could have racked up $30. However, if you put the placard out then housekeeping doesn't come at all. Perhaps they will change the policy. I understand that by not changing the sheets everyday you save energy, water, soap, and eventually labor cost; but I personally would just like to have the bed made and the trash taken away every day.

The property itself is great - in a decent spot in downtown Phoenix, the lobby is very expansive and beautiful, and it has all of the \"bones\" of a great hotel. The gym was one of the best I have ever seen, and the pool has a lot of potential (more on this later). Most of the staff was very, very friendly and all were helpful. The room was 'ok'. I was on the 27th floor facing north. It was nothing special, but also got the job done. The desk was a good size, and the bathroom was well-lit and had plenty of room. The gift shop had a lot of \"gifty-type\" things in it, but not very much in the way of food/drink (which is to be expected I think). The staff in there was extremely friendly every time I was in there, which was a couple times a day. The elevators were a marvel of modern engineering - it seemed that no matter where I was, there was almost no wait for an elevator. I have honestly never seen anything like it before. The gym was a highlight - I believe it branded as Core Performance (or something similar), and they did a great job with it. Tons of room, lots of good equipment, and it had a wall of glass overlooking the pool area. Very nice. Now for some of the bad: * The person in the room before me has long dark hair. How do I know that? Because it was everywhere. On the bed, on the desk, on the bathroom sink, and in the shower. It was pretty obvious that it was there, so I don't know how the housekeepers missed it. * The pool area was nice - but not maintained. At all. There were used towels on a lot of the chairs and some garbage left over from previous days, the pool deck area needed to be swept, and the pool needed to be skimmed. The tables and chairs were all over the place (no order whatsoever). It was generally a mess. It was very obvious that nobody is in charge of keeping the pool area clean. Things can get busy during the day, but seeing it in this condition in the morning was a sign to me that no effort was made to clean up the mess from the day before. * The service in the pool area bar was pretty bad. I was there three days with two different bartenders/servers. The service was alright, but their attitudes were not. One day, the girl was just not friendly (no biggie). The next day, the guy seemed overworked, and gave me the impression that it was a bother to order some food and drinks. The third day, the same guy was a little rude when I asked a question about the hours. Every other person in the hotel was very, very friendly - so maybe that's why these two looked so bad. * I went to get taxis a could times, and always ended up with a car service that was way too expensive for what I needed. Oh, and how could I forget - they have no meter. So it is completely up to the driver to decide what to charge you once you get dropped off. I ended up going off the property and getting a regular taxi, and the driver said that the Sheraton does not allow regular taxis on the property, and only pushes the use of the significantly more expensive car service. This was confirmed with TWO other cabbies. They mentioned that the hotel staff is \"in on it\" and gets kickbacks for this, but obviously that can't be proven. Regardless of the background, I think it is kind of shady that they call you over a car with no meter, and pass it off as a cab. Just something to be aware of. * This isn't necessarily important to some, but I am an SPG Gold member, and was not offered a room upgrade nor a late checkout. Yes, these two perks are provided \"when available\", but there was zero hesitation to say \"no\" when I asked for either. There is a cool little area across the street that has some good restaurants and bars.

Parking was at a rate of $17 per night. The parking was well lit and had a safe feeling about it. The lobby was very large and filled with a number of eclectic seating areas. There was a bar in the lobby that was reasonable in price. Checking in was odd. There are a number of free standing desk areas where the host checks you in. There is also a large column in the center of the check in area and people lined up on both sides. The hostess came around from behind the counter and greeted us. I introduced myself and handed her my Starwood Card, my ID, and a credit card. We were assigned a room with two double beds. I asked for a King sized bed and was told they were all accounted for. ( I am glad none of them were missing.) The hostess failed to meet our request. For the first time in over 30 years, the hostess questioned the person with me and our relationship to each other. I understand having their name in case they get locked out, but that was not the feeling I got. As we turned and walked away, we found security standing behind us. Very odd. We were in town just to watch spring training so jeans, tee shirts, and ball caps were the dress of the day. I assumed that if I was in my business attire my treatment would have been different. Our room was very clean and tastefully decorated. It had a small refrigerator in a little outcove with the safe right above it. One bed was very comfortable and the other one was so so. Overall we had a very pleasant sleep. In the morning we spoke with the cleaning staff and they were very polite. We took in the gym and it was very nice. Clean, open, and overlooked the pool.

My room was on the 18th floor with a view to the West. The view itself stretched far beyond the Phoenix city limits to the vast deserts to the mountains, a nice setting for a deeply contemplative person. :) Ask for one of the upper floors and you will love it! Pros: The check-in process was quick and easy -- they have a great \"Green\" program where they give you $5 credit or 500 Starwood points for every night that you refuse cleaning service. Eco-friendly and rewarding! The bed was fantastic, I slept like an eight month old baby. Nice flat screen TV with many cable channels, but a bit slow to switch from the menu. The bathroom and linen were very clean, everything worked, no issues. The decor was elegant, nothing special but I was staying in a room in the Bellagio. The staff was extremely courteous, especially the welcome group outside. They go out of their way to make you feel comfortable, finding you a cab or pointing you to the right place. Cannot beat the location -- Phoenix is very spread out but this is right across a huge mall with an AMC theater. Many places to eat with every kind of cuisine a short walk away. There was not really a whole lot of traffic (I'm from Boston) and I liked that the Phoenix Convention Center was right around the corner. I have stayed at this hotel and the Hyatt next door, and both are very comparable. The Sheraton arguably has the better gym but Hyatt has the better restaurant. That said, Sheraton wins because its gift shop is much much superior! Cons: I have a couple of minor quibbles. First, there is NO wireless internet in the rooms, which is surprising because this is a four star downtown hotel. Then they charge you $12.95 for the ethernet, which is a bit of a rip off (and hence I deduct one star). Also there is no concession for SPG members, which is a bit strange. In general, if you're not traveling on business, the room rates could burn a hole in your wallet! Overall, I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a hassle-free stay in an elegant hotel.

Maybe I have stayed in too many boutique-type hotels, as this hotel was HUGE, but very typical BOX style lobby, hallways and rather small room....what you would expect from any other big-name hotel. Upon check-in service was very pleasant and professional, and the room was ready at around 12pm. I thought the room rate was VERY high ($250.00 - conference rate) for the amenities offered here, and there certainly was not much to attract you to this area of Phoenix except for the Convention Center about 2-blocks away. The downtown area here appeared to be empty. The Arizona Center across the street was very sad, and just about empty of stores as well. Looks like this is the area for the sporting events, which may be why this downtown area even exists, and if that's the case surely Phoenix will build up this area to attract more people and money. The pool area was at a lower level, and the view from the pool and outside bar was of adjacent building walls....no view at all! I was hoping to see a beautiful Arizona sunset from either of these areas but no. The room was typical and my first impression was that it was rather small. The bed was wonderful, with very nice linens. The hotel and room appeared to be very clean. They are serving Starbucks coffee in the business center area with amazing pastries made right on site. The restaurant \"District\" impressed us the first night, and when we ate there again 2 days later the service was abysmal. The waiter was telling how special their garden is, with organic items served yet it appeared that the wait-staff was working their first night ever in a restaurant. At $100.00 per couple (no wine) the service and food should be impeccable. The menu was quite creative, however, and I was never served cotton-candy as a final treat when the check is delivered. Nice touch and very creative! If they obtain experienced professional wait-staff then they will truly have a special restaurant. Overall our stay was fine, but I will not stay in this area again when I return to the Phoenix area. I will stay in the Scottsdale area where there is lots to see, do, and places to eat.

I'm rating this as excellent, but I did encounter problems. While visiting a family member in the hospital, I neglected to book a hotel. This was a few days after Thanksgiving at the begining of December. Almost everywhere near, or around the hospital was booked up. I thought of the Sheraton, because I know for a fact they have 1,000 rooms, and highly doubted that all one thousand rooms would be booked. As I inquired about the rooms, Jess from the front desk was cheerful. and with a smile on her face; she says \"Sir, we have one thousand rooms here at this property. We're not even close to being half full. I have plenty of rooms available.\" I had a AAA discount, and she quickly changed her mood and said \"Oh, sorry. We're sold out of extending discounts.\" I was a little surprised at that. With not being close to half full as she says, you would figure that one would be more than happy to offer a discount to keep the customer from walking away. Not trying to squeeze every penny out of the customer. I was tired at that point. Too tired to keep searching for a place to stay, and emotionally tired giving the situation with my family memeber being in the hospital. I said \"That's fine, I got no other choice\" I told her. She could tell I was upset aside from the price, and asked what was wrong. I was in needed of unloading my problems, so I told her. She offered her sympothy, and said the standard price was $179. With the hotel I work at, we're trained to say \"The rate is ___ plus tax.\" I had flat out asked if the $179 was before or after tax, and she stood firm and said \"$179\" and wrote it on my key card. I have a friend that works for a Westin near Anaheim, but he was unable to fax over the paperwork to get me a Starwood Family/Friend Rate. I'll be honest. The lobby is warm and inviting. The lights are very low for ambiance, but it is hard to see inside, especially at the front desk. My room was small, but nice. The HVAC unit didn't work, and I did report it, but nothing was ever done about it. Jess was nice enough to send up a complementary plate of heart shaped chocolates, and wrote a nice note on it. To me, that showed she cared. The bed was very comfortable, but since I was on the 27th Floor, it did get chilly over night. On check out, I spoke with another front desk agent, and noted to her that maintence had never came by to my room to look at the HVAC unit, and she didn't seem to care. She was a blonde lady. I was hoping to get a discount for the trouble, but she said \"I'll forward this to my manager, and someone will contact you in a few days.\" No one ever did. My final bill was over $200. I said \"I was told it was $179. I had asked a few times if that rate was before or after tax, and I got the same answer '$179.' \" This desk agent said \"Well, I don't know why she didn't tell you it was $179 plus tax. I do apologize.\" I only made a fuss about my cold room, because when you take a nice hot shower, and open the bathroom door, you're greeted by the cold air in the room. Overall, I was pleased by the hotel, with the exception of the minor problems. The decor was nice. Their grand Christmas display was very nice.

This is a superb hotel, with plenty of the amenities one would expect, but sometimes find absent elsewhere.

I appreciated their \"make a green choice\" option to forgo a day's housekeeping service - saving some energy - with the inducement to consider doing so a modest $5 gift card. Made me think twice about luxuriating in fresh linens & towels every day of my stay at the price of a bit deeper carbon footprint. Nice touch. The one I ended up really appreciating, I first took as being a little silly. Upon my arrival I was greeted warmly by all of the bellmen/valets at the portico. I was a bit bemused that each of the some five or so people offered their personal welcome the first time I entered. The first time I walked out, I was also bid a cheery good day by the then 7+ portico staff. OK, I thought. They all got the friendly face of service memo and are abiding by it. It was a pleasantly whimsical that they all said something cheerful upon my return a little later. Each conveying genuine good will, not rote repetition of a script. So, over the course of my three day stay, every darn time I walked in and out to and from my conference and related engagements - genuine, personable and unique greetings and farewells came forth from each of the no less that two bellmen/valets on duty. I have gone on at some length here describing seemingly simple acts to try and convey a sense of how out of the ordinary I found it. I'm an urban guy from a leading city, I interact with greeting and assistant staff all the time. These folks made me take unique notice that every interaction did not feel formulaic and lent a sense that we were all in on the friendly game.

When I called customer service about the alarm clock, they were not empathetic at all--I got a brief-sorry-- so I asked to speak to the manager who was very good about it and said he would speak to the housekeeping manager to remind staff to turn off the alarms in rooms where guests had checked out. He also gave us a food credit, which was very nice of him. On a Sunday afternoon, the restaurant was dead, but service was still very slow. There was less than a skeleton staff on, and it would have been better to close the restaurant than have such slow service. Pool is a lap pool and by mid afternoon loses the sun.

I had brought gift bags for some of my co-workers staying there and for a small fee, delivered each gift bag to each recipient's room after check-in. The beds, linens, and pillows were divine. Better sleep there than at home! I was shocked. The room was elegant, yet contemporary. The bathroom amenities were top shelf. I really enjoyed the orange lotion. The towels were fluffy. Room service was excellent and efficient. The poolside service was great. Not too much attention, but just enough. The cocktails were awesome (but quite pricey). I didn't visit the fitness center, but I heard that it was great. What I really appreciated was that if you opted out of maid service, you were given a $5 off coupon to use at their restaurant or room service. For someone that doesn't like housekeeping poking around my room, it worked great for me. If you want clean towels or extra lotion/soap/etc., you just called for it and they would deliver. The \"coffee bar\" was awesome, but not necessary if you like brewed coffee. The room coffee was AWESOME. The bell service was quick and efficient. The ambience of the entire hotel was bright and open and despite all the marble, it was not \"cold\".

Truth be told, I've never been a big fan of Phoenix because of the heat and the brown landscape (117 degrees is 117 degrees, dry heat or not) but my recent stay at the Sheraton Phoenix Downtown was by far the best. I was greeted immediately by not one but two valets when I pulled up. The friendly young man at the registration desk made a point to come out from behind the desk to greet me personally. That may have been a function of having no queue but still a class move. I was given a promotion that tripled my rewards points, told where everything was, when everything was available and how to get there (I was on an executive floor that required special access). The room was everything i expected and I was fortunate to have a good view of what I consider a pretty boring landscape; all flat, all brown and then beautiful mountains (all with unique names) jutting up out of the flatness. I gained a different appreciation for the Airzona landscape in that room. I went green and declined maid service everyday for which i was given a voucher for a discount on future stays which was new to me. I don't require fresh linens or towels as I am the only to use them and i'm not in town for long so I thought that was a very smart option to give eco-conscious travelers. I was there for a business summit so the meeting accomodations were top notch but the highlight of my stay by far was an awesome bartender at the lounge bar, Carrie. She was just a trainee but she was attentive, she was friendly, had a smile to die for and someone I would go back to the Sheraton just to see. She told me where I could find funs things to do while I was in town, talked sports and laughed at my awful jokes. I would be remiss if I didn't mention her trainer, Matt (I hope that's his name) because he was great too. Cheers, Carrie and Matt :) Carrie, Matt, the rest of the staff and the world class service all amounted to a memerable stay at a classy hotel in a city for which I have a new found love.

We were greeted with a warm welcoming smile from the hostess, had a very friendly, fast and helpful bartender at the bar, then after we were seated, we were blown away at the most incredible service we have had in a long time.

And, you can taste the difference with those freshly picked veggies in the garden salad I had. The filet was the best I ever remember having.

The next time we dined there, the service was non-existent and the restaurant manager was defensive and had a terrible attitude. The gym is fabulous! One of the best around, but there is no spa at all and the pool, even though advertised as heated, is cold and small (although the hot tub is nice). The view from my room was amazing and the bed and bedding were great, but I think that housekeeping is the real weak link in this hotel. When I first entered my room there was a used towel and robe hanging on the back of the bathroom door! Disgusting. It took several calls to get extra hangers and they were very stingey with their toiletries. The bathroom was great, very spacious, and the complementary bottled water was a nice touch. But paying for wifi is an insult, particularly since you can use computers in their 'connect lounge' for free and the wifi in the Club Lounge on the 28th floor is free. A hotel should be ashamed of itself to nickel and dime a traveler like that, especially when they look you in the eye and tell you how much they care about your comfort. The location was very convenient for us next to the convention center. The hotel does not have a complementary airport shuttle, which is outrageous since the airport is only about 3 miles away.

They have the \"Make a Green Choice\" card which allows you to completely skip housekeeping service for you room if you hang the card from your door handle. They give you a $5 in house gift card (valid only at this hotel) that you can use as a credit towards drinks or food. Now this is a GREAT deal for the hotel, since they no longer need to pay the labor charge for having a maid come in and make up the room, no towels to wash, no sheets to change, no coffee and tea to restock. Yes, this is indeed the green choice, as in abundant green savings for Sheraton. Other notes: Parking is $17/day or $25/day for valet.

We left Paige for a short bit, spent some time in the comfortable, relaxing, oudoor whirlpool, and returned to the lounge later to dine.

The hotel was very nice and you could right away that it was clean and new. The lobby area is beautiful and it has a very nice bar area that was always full and bustling with activity. The rooms are feel laid out and have a nice comfortable feel to them. The TV is a 32 inch flat screen and the room also has a small safe and fridge. Each night I ate at the District Restaurant's bar. The District restaurant is located just off the lobby and has a very modern yet comfortable feel. The restaurant has an attached bar area in which you can order bar food or order directly from the dinner menu of the attached restaurant. I had originally planned on going out to eat at least two of the nights but since the bar offered great food choices and excellent quality I decided to eat there each night. The bar has good beer choices with excellent happy hour prices. Stone IPA was only $3 from 3p-7p and they had a wide variety of other craft beers as well. The reel reason the bar area was my choice each night was the excellent service I received from the bartenders. I meet Austin Assad on the first night and he remembered me and my choice of beer by the second night. He was very attentive to everyone at the bar and always stayed on top of things. He also gave you a good conversation and very useful food and drink recommendations. I also had the pleasure of being served on some of the nights by Matt. Together they made me look forward to coming to eat at the District bar each night. Although I did not try them the mixed drinks looked very well made and they added their own flare to the drinks instead of pushing out the same old cocktails. Both Matt and Austin recommended the 72 short ribs from the dinner menu and they were fantastic. I in turn recommended them to some fellow bar mates and they ordered and enjoyed them as well. The choice of appetizers from the bar menu and different types of sliders made my food choices tough each night. I would recommend the crab cake sliders as well as the huge meatball appetizer. I also tried a few of the desserts with the pumpkin whoppie pies and the bread pudding both being outstanding. My stay at the Sheraton downtown Phoenix was outstanding and I look forward to being sent back to Phoenix on business. Austin and Matt made each night on my stay enjoyable and I felt at home in the bar area. Their mixture of friendly banter, attentive service and excellent recommendations turned only a few nights at the bar into 5 excellent nights.

Rooms are tiny, halls are dark and low ceilinged -- felt like I was back in the 70's once I left the lobby. Two different days, the room was not serviced by housekeeping -- which is no big deal except that we really did run out of towels (even after re-using them) and we also had to call for toilet paper because when the room was attended to, housekeeping did not notice that. These are small things, but when you are traveling for a busy convention they eat up minutes and also create a sort of hassled feeling. One day I returned from a busy day of meetings and the room still had not been freshened up by 4 p.m. I called guest services and asked that they at least come up and take out the trash/exchange the towels before we returned at 9 p.m. It was still not tended to, so as we were preparing to sleep, we had to stay up and wait for housekeeping to do what they should have done at 9 in the morning or at 4 p.m. when I asked. The poor evening housekeeping staff looked at us like we were a nuisance, but it wasn't their fault-- or ours -- it was the previous shift's. Note that at this hotel you only have the option to call \"guest services\" for everything -- no separate lines for the front desk or housekeeping. There was not one time that I called guest services and got directly to a person. You have to listen to a recording and then be put on hold when you call for help. Next, the internet access in this property is arcane and byzantine. Aside from the fact that it costs $13.00/day, it is hard to access. The front desk had blocked ours (because we were listed under more than one name, but it was all on my credit card which they had on file downstairs) and after repeated requests to get access it was repeatedly impossible to log onto the internet. This problem persisted over multiple days and shifts even though the front desk said they would fix it. This headache forced me to go across the street to work and catch up on correspondence at Starbuck's. I am flexible and experienced at travel and willing to put up with a hurdle or two, but this was just dumb. After the first or second ask someone should have just made sure I got what I needed. I did call the 800 number on the card on the desk and the line was always busy. I have to say I NEVER have this problem at Marriotts -- even the downscale properties like Fairfield Inn. There is a sort of internet cafe in the lobby with the offer of printing boarding passes free. It does work, but 9 out of 10 people get pretty confused about how to make it work -- and I am talking about sophisticated business travelers who find this property's particular log in to check in screens confusing. There is no reason for it to be confusing or for grown men and women to have to stumble around asking each other for help. I saw numbers of people decide to just leave and get their passes at the airport after being frustrated. I went to the concierge at one point to inquire about transportation for a special event. She was on the phone on what was clearly a personal call ...giggling, making small talk with a friend or lover, while several of us stood and waited and the line grew longer. And though this is an expensive convention hotel in a major downtown area, we were harrasssed by a homeless creep right in front of the property. The man followed us into the building and would've gotten into the elevator with us had we not retreated and asked the front desk to call security. Security was there in a jiffy and the fistfight did not last long. I know that this creeper was not the hotel's problem, but on the other hand I have never had to witness anything like this in any other fine hotel. Just a heads up to anyone coming down here for a convention, just because you are paying top dollar for this Sheraton doesn't mean you will be safer or more secure. Three blocks up the street on Van Buren is a Springfield Suites hotel. It costs half as much, is probably just as safe and the rooms are bigger, the beds are bigger. Breakfast is free there, the internet is free there and it works and the pool is outdoors and about the same size as this one. For your money you will get a better night's sleep there, not have to wait as long at the elevator, not have to beg to get your room made up and only walk about a block further to get to the convention center. We ate a $17 breakfast here that was not very good. It should at least be good in a property like this. No kidding, the waffles are just as good at that free buffet up the street at the SpringHill. It has been a long time since I have felt this \"had\" by a chain property. More than one guest services/desk/housekeeping person had a chance to make the impression different, but instead I was made to feel like a nuisance.

The food and service were both excellent. It's important to note that as a frequent traveler and the owner of a wine and gourmet food shop that I rarely eat in hotel restaurants. However, we ate here for three other meals because of the quality of the food and the service. In addition to quality food and service, they have a wonderful selection of regional draft microbrews and a great wine selection. I did venture out to two other restaurants while there, but frankly wished that I had not done so and they were inferior. Belen Boll, assistant manager, was phenomenal, extremely knowledgeable and engaging! All of the wait staff was very attentive especially Narah Bradley who Belen asked to wait on us for our final function with clients.

Chose the hotel b/c it was located downtown and has been mentioned as pet friendly and also b/c it is a Starwood Property. We showed up to the Sheraton with two dogs (50-60lbs) and were greeted by a very friendly valet/bell staff that were very helpful. The check in process was very smooth and was not a problem even with the two dogs. The lobby is very modern, clean, and inviting, and they still had their holiday train set up as the centerpiece of the lobby. Unfortunately the standard room was on the very small side. The only thing smaller than the room was the size of the TV relative to the wall that it was on. The d\u00e9cor of the room was very nice and comfortable. The bed was perfect for a good night of sleep. The bathroom was a very good size in comparison to the room and the water pressure is the shower was quite good. The pet friendliness continued when water bowls and beds were brought up. Unfortunately, the dogs did make a \u201cjailbreak\u201d down the hall as I chased after them. Other than that, there were no other issues with the dogs and all staff seemed to quite enjoy having them around. Another good aspect of the hotel is the Valley Overlook located on the 4th floor that provides a nice outside area with a view of the downtown/valley area. The dogs liked that area as they could run around for a bit while not on the leash. We also met friends for appetizers and cocktails at District Bar in the lobby. Great happy hour prices on the small plates which did a good job of offsetting the price of the cocktails which were a bit high. Overall, next time I am in Phoenix and need to stay in the downtown to central Phoenix area I will definitely have the Sheraton at the top of my list.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "White Plains, New York", "Title": "\u201cMr. Assad was the warmest staff we encountered.\u201d", "Author": "arilkcup", "ReviewID": "UR91006163", "Content": "Arrived in Phoenix well after 9pm and after checking in went in search of some libations.

I had read the corner rooms were oversized but I really don't think that is true - we did have a larger bathroom but that's it. The rooms are an OK size with a large desk and flat screen TV. I must admit the closet & clothes area was a bit on the small side. It looks like an armoire built into the wall with a small closet area sitting above 2 smallish drawers. And that was all the room offered for storage - which is just fine for a short stay but there were 2 of us there for 5 days and I had both business & play clothes so it was a bit cramped. The room was tastefully appointed and extremely quiet - I never heard a sound from outside the door. Valet parking was $25/day or self park for $19. We used the valet and the car was always ready by the time we walked out the door. The District Bar was fun place to have a drink - we ate at the restaurant and we were not at all impressed. Service was good, but I thought the menu was limited in scope and the food was only just OK. They have a Starbucks cafe for morning coffee. Housekeeping was excellent. Fitness Center was large with more cardio equipment than I have seen in other hotels along with weights and machines. Pool was more of a lap pool and there was hot tub. I didn't use the pool but did go to the Fitness Center every day. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again - excellent hotel with superior service from everyone we encountered.", "Date": "October 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, OH", "Title": "\u201cVery Convenient\u201d", "Author": "DavidandKim", "ReviewID": "UR84383209", "Content": "I was in Phoenix for a conference at the Convention Center.

The WOW factor is evident in this gorgeous place. My first impression was the carefully selected staff members. From the time that I stepped out of the car to the end of my stay, I found the staff to be extremely customer service oriented. Eye contact, sincere greetings and friendliness are the norm here. It is a Starwood Group Hotel, so it is run differently than your normal Sheraton. It is very Ritz-Carlton in ambiance and the lobby is gorgeous. Modern, sleek, open, spacious, immaculate. There is a lovely cafe', lobby bar and the front desk is very European in it's vibe. The bell staff, security people and managers greet everyone and make you feel very welcome. The rooms are comfortable and well equipped. Quiet is something that I have to have when sleeping and it exceeded my expectations. Blackout curtains, fabulous bed, fridge, Starbucks coffee in the room really made my stay wonderful. The restaurant is fabulous and has a resort style breakfast buffet that will help you start your day. Again, the staff was extremely friendly and accomodating in the restaurant. If you need a PC, they have lobby PC's available free of charge for guests. All have huge plasma screens. Want an inexpensive cup of coffee and a snack? They have that in the lobby cafe'. The City of Phoenix has done a slam dunk job of rehabilitating this area and the ASU Campus is within walking distance. Across the street, you will find great restaurants, shops and an AMC 24 Theatre. You can take the Light Rail to Tempe and Mesa if necessary. The hotel will give you a walking map of the city, so that you can try some wonderful restaurants within a 3-4 block area.

I felt that before I could really review a hotel property, I had to sleep there. Lady Gaga recently came to Phoenix to strut her stuff.

With 4 of us spending the night a few friends joined us as we primped and partied in anticipation of seeing Mama Monster. Everything about the Sheraton was seamless. Parking valet, check in, and bellman were very efficient. The room was WOW! There were two bedrooms, each connecting to a common living room with a view of downtown Phoenix and South Mountain beyond. We were able to watch all of the concert activity around USAirways from our windows! Furnishings are new and tasteful in a very clean simple way. Contemporary prints of cacti decorate the walls.

As I deal with sensitive material, I did not feel that it would be safe to be in an open area. Most larger hotels now have free internet...No reason they should not here. My main complaint stems from the horrible service we had in the lounge. After consuming a few adult beverages some colleagues decided to head to across town 20 minutes away. I decided to remain at the lounge and grab a burger and another drink which did come in a relatively fast time. I asked for my check to be brought with my burger, but it was not. After finishing my drink and burger 30 minutes went by and still no check and no waitress. I found another and told her what was happening and she said she would get it fixed. Fifteen minutes later still no check. Mr friends had returned from their trip with a total time gone of over 1.5 hours while i ate and waited for my check...so I had enough and left. Next evening I went back to see about the check and they were having fits because I \"skipped out\" and wanted to add a \"automatic gratuity\" to the check. I have no problem paying my bills, but I really think staff should not abandon their patrons and I think I was in every bit of the right to leave after waiting 45 minutes for the bill after eating...My Server's name was Maggie and this occurred June 24,2010", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dayton, OH", "Title": "\u201cPolite Service and Nice Extras\u201d", "Author": "LindseyMac", "ReviewID": "UR68335979", "Content": "I travel a lot for business and found this to be one of the best hotels I have stayed at.

Just as the other members, I was advised to stay at the Sheraton Downtown Phoenix Hotel since the meeting room and other events were scheduled there. The reservation and all payments were made through the Expedia in December. In January my credit card was charged in full and a reservation confirmation was issued. I was surprised that I was charged in full that early. Normally, hotels do it at the check-out, but I said to myself \u201cIt\u2019s OK\u201d. At this point at least I was absolutely sure that I am all set and can fully concentrate on my business. In the morning of February 28, lesser than 8 hours before the flight, I suddenly received an e-mail asking to immediately contact the hotel. When I called, the receptionist told me that my reservation has been cancelled. Below is approximate phone conversation, as I recall it: - Sorry Sir but your reservation has been canceled. - I made my reservation in December last year specifically far enough in advance to be sure that I\u2019m at the same hotel as the rest of my team and I have everything I need for my business! - Sir we\u2019re overloaded, and we have to cancel your reservation. We have a situation when people staying in our hotel decided to extend their stay and so we have to cancel your reservation. We can try to place you in another hotel if you wish. - No, I do not want you to place me in another hotel and I will have my room tonight! - We will try our best Sir, but we can\u2019t guarantee you a room. There are many(!) cancellations we\u2019re going through right now. Sorry\u2026 I hang up and called Expedia. They were shocked and tried to call the hotel but came back with the same result. All the conversations took total of more than 2 hours crashing all my last-minute trip preparations. Finally, somebody from the Expedia management called me and said that situation has been partially resolved \u2013 I may stay in Sheraton for 1 night. I accepted the change expressing my deepest dissatisfaction (a real anger, actually). When I arrived to the Sheraton, I was confirmed that I have one night only. I asked if my stay can be extended for the 2nd night and was informed that the chances are slim to none. Only the direct interaction of the SME top administration changed the situation and I was offered to stay for the 2nd night. As a mining engineer heaving behind my shoulders decades of traveling experience throughout the United States and abroad, I have stayed in all kind of hotels, motels and other, but I was never treated this bad. I can not recall anything even close to the situation in which an administration of a hotel literally tried to throw a guest out from the hotel. But that\u2019s exactly the case with Sheraton DT Phoenix. I\u2019m sure that a hotel should not take a reservation and full payment in advance especially if there is no guaranty that the room will be available. But if they accepted the payment and issued a confirmation, than no matter what they have to perform their duties as obligated. Follow-up A few weeks later, after I complained to the Sheraton administration, they connected me to a customer service representative who explained me why all this happened. According to those explanations everything what happened is normal, routine situation. More than that, I\u2019ve been informed that under the State of Arizona Law, hotel can not remove a guest from the room if it decided to stay longer. So, according to this law, Arizona hotels routinely cancel reservations of their upcoming guests. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s probably OK to throw your quest out to the street, but from the Sheraton stand-point only. Personally, I do not think so. In addition to enormous mistreat of their guests, the hotel demonstrated their 100% careless customer service.

The colors and decor throughout the hotel is friendly and warm, which makes this hotel a pleasant place to stay. The beds are very comfortable. The bathrooms are also well done. While Sheraton is usually one of Starwood's lesser brands, this Sheraton is pretty much Westin quality as far as the rooms go. There are 3 issues though which reduce my rating: 1) Service. I have had several issues with service in this hotel and get the impression they don't really care about customer satisfaction. One is the room service dining. I have on multiple occassions tried to order chocolate cake with a scoop of ice cream. They won't give me a scoop of ice cream because it isn't in the description and insist on charging an extra $8 to buy an entire pint of ice cream. However, they do serve single a single scoop of ice cream with the apple pie. This intransigence is completely ridiculous, and non service oriented. Also the doormen never offer to carry your luggage to the room unless you actually ask them. 2) Treatment of loyal guests. I used to stay at this hotel every week. However, there were a number of occassions during conferences where they were busy and charged higher prices for the rooms (which were nonetheless still available). I asked the front desk if they could give me the usual corporate rate since I am a regular guest and they refused saying they were sold out at the corporate rate. 3) Maintenance. Most of the shower heads in this hotel are clogged at the edges which means instead of getting a cone-shaped spray from the shower head, you get a narrow spray which means you need to move around a lot in the shower. This could easily be fixed, and I don't understand why they don't just do it.", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moreno Valley, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Downtown Phoenix!\u201d", "Author": "anuday05", "ReviewID": "UR59790691", "Content": "We stayed at the Sheraton due to my mom attending a Capella University conference being held at this hotel.

Good: When we went back down about the room and vending the young man that helped us got us into a nice corner room. The bathroom layout was weird, but hey, no noisy junk outside the door. The room had a great view of Camelback and my wife now knows why it has that name. While I was waiting one afternoon for my wife to exit a meeting I stopped and had a Guinness at the bar. I had a great conversation with a black gentleman whose name I have forgotten (I cannot remember names!), but impressed me greatly. I wish I would have had more time to talk with him. Cleanliness was okay. There were some paperclips and paper, etc in the hall on our floor for the whole stay. The room was very well cleaned. The restaurant, as expected was obnoxious in it's pricing.

Pros: views, comfy beds, beautiful bathroom, large desk Cons: weird vibrating sound in the bathroom which may have been from the elevators, no robes so I was a bit chilly", "Date": "January 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson", "Title": "\u201cWhy note get real worls class go to Vegas\u201d", "Author": "TucsonTommy", "ReviewID": "UR23004289", "Content": "It is a typical Sheraton nothing to write home about.

Everything was cooked properly and was seasoned like I would at home. The waitstaff was kind and performed seemlessly. My stay was almost ruined by housekeeping. I wanted ice. Go get the ice bucket right. Can't there are moldy grapes in the bottom. I call for another bucket. I call again. I call again. Finally someone brings me a new bucket, but they leave the old bucket with the moldy grapes and they don't leave any liners for the new bucket. I finally took the bucket with its content downstairs. I was helped by a friendly lady apologized, she later who sent Fiji water to my room. My problem was I could not even relax wondering what else wasn't cleaned...

It is a typical large business oriented hotel, but it has a good location and good amenities. We stayed on the Club floor - although the hotel seemed almost empty the night we were there we were put in a room way at the end of the corridor on the side of the hotel with only one small window. Nicely furnished rooms but small and with just the one small window, not able to fully appreciate the great views from the 28th floor. The Club Lounge was very nice - Stacey who works there was great!! She made our stay. Nice enough pool area on the 4th floor, but it's a little bland. Staff were great everywhere - very friendly and attentive. Cafe in the lobby with free internet (if you're a guest) was nice and the lobby bar is a good place to relax. Didn't try the restaurant, although we came back a week later at 9:45pm on a Friday night and were turned away as they were \"no longer serving food\" - not even after theater dessert. When will Phoenix start acting like a big city! Overall, decent place to stay as there are not too many options in downtown Phoenix.", "Date": "November 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cBest downtown hotel by far\u201d", "Author": "colleen90405", "ReviewID": "UR21784158", "Content": "Finally, downtown Phoenix has a nice hotel - all these years your only option was dingy old hotels, I would stay on the outskirts at the Ritz. But the new Sheraton - a Starwood hotel - just opened and its lovely, great staff and location. Restaurant had a great menu, too. Staff said the gym was amazing but I did not see it. I got upgraded as a Starwood member to a higher quality room, but to me it didnt look special, looked like a regular room, perhaps b/c there was a view they called it better. Rooms are fine - clean, moder furnishings, bright, internet access - no fridge or food drawer. Downsides are small stuff like the ironing board is miniature, seriously resembles a toy that belonds in a girls' playhouse, hurt to bend over to iron all my suits.
