First, the hotel is a little tricky to find. If coming from the airport, take the train to Trastevere (8 Euros). When you come out of the station you can either take the tram towards Argentina Square. (It's about 3 stops - get off at Piazza Bernardino da Felte) or you can walk. It's about 15-20 mins. (a bit further than stated on the hotel\u2019s directions with your booking confirmation.) Go right, when you come out of the train station, following the tram tracks, until you get to Bernardinoo da Felte (it's a small square with a lot of parked cars on the right). Turn right here, and the hotel is on the left down a side alley. Front desk - everyone was very helpful. They provided a map, food recommendations, which buses/trams to get to the sights, and sold bus tickets. Everyone spoke good English. Room - large for Europe, modern and minimalist. Ours had a balcony and these amazing electronic shutters that blocked out all sound and light. It was extremely quiet and very clean. The only minus was that the bed was not that comfortable. We could feel the springs and our double was two mattresses put together but we found this everywhere in Italy. Breakfast - Wow! Room is huge, light and airy. Huge selection including eggs, bacon, sausage, yogurt, breads, pastries, juices, coffee, water etc. Much more than we expected for Europe. Location \u2013 We personally loved the Trastevere area. It is about 50/50 tourists/local Italians. We liked getting away from the high tourist areas. We used the bus/tram to get to the main sights. We could have walked but wanted to save our energy for walking around the actual sights! Public transport is cheap and frequent and just steps away from the hotel on the main road. We walked into Trastevere every evening for dinner (about a 10 min walk). We found the restaurants to be good value and quality compared to the other areas we visited in Italy. Our favorite was Ivo\u2019s on Via San Francesco a Ripa (closed on Tuesdays). Order the cacio e pepe, (a local Roman dish) and all the pizzas were good. (We went there twice) We also enjoyed dinners at Popi Popi (also on Via San Francesco a Ripa) and Casetta Del Trastevere in Piazza de\u2019Renzi (very traditional Roman food). Overall, we found the Ripa Hotel to be tremendous value, in great location and we would recommend it to friends and return next time we are in Rome. I would highly recommend staying in the Trastevere area if you want to see today\u2019s real Rome, and easily get tired of the high tourist areas with their low quality food and high prices.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cAn unexpected pearl...\u201d", "Author": "sgiuliani", "ReviewID": "UR126518029", "Content": "I was traveling to Rome on a business trip and as it happens sometimes, my client who was in charge of arranging my accommodation, didn't do such a great job.

We chose Hotel Ripa based on information found on the internet. Upon arrival, the desk staff were very friendly and helpful (and bilingual). Our room was very accommodating, but nothing fancy. There were two instances that were not met with satisfaction from us during our stay. First, our room was cleaned during the day while were were away from the hotel. Once we returned to find a long black hair in the sink and one in the bidet (which we never used and would not belong to either of us). This same night, we found cigarette butts on the balcony floor and in our trash can. On another night, after returning from dinner, we found our balcony door open. Not unlocked, but unlocked and open (about a foot wide). We were startled to walk into a dark room, turn the lights on, and see this! We are two women traveling abroad alone, so this did not settle well at all! After searching the room over, we went downstairs to report this. The hair and cigarette incident seemed insignificant compared to the door, but we reported both. Hotel management was conerned and did say they would address the problem with the appropriate staff member. On another night, I wanted to purchase wi-fi minutes so I could Skype home, so I went to the desk and asked to purchase the minutes. The male clerk, Patrizio, took my money and gave me change and the coupon and password needed to sign on. I had a question with the exchange as I paid in dollars (as we had done 3 night previously) but their cost was calculated in Euros. When I proposed my question to Patrizio, he was obviously insulted (for some reason), raised his voice, and loudly exclaimed, \"It is VERY EASY, Madame! You gave me this... I gave you that... It IS correct!\" I was quite taken aback by his abrupt answer and retreated to my room, all the while, mumbling under my voice. The more I thought about it, the more frustrated I became as I recounted my change and still didn't agree nor understand his calculations. So I returned down to the desk and approached him again by saying, \"I am still confused about this transaction. I just don't understand how my change is this amount. I am not stupid, I just don't understand. Can you please explain this to me again?\" He left the desk area, went to a calculator, pushed some series of buttons, tore off the tape, and placed the paper in front of me, again exclaiming, \"Madame, this is VERY EASY! You see, the total is there (as he points to the paper).\" So I just politely told him \"I am obviously American. In America, customers can ask others questions without being yelled at. It's my money, I'm spending it here with you. I have just said I don't understand the transaction and have just asked for assistance with it. Nothing more. What I don't expect is to be yelled at by you. It's not what I'm paying for.\" He quickly rebuked and said, \"No.. Madame, Madame... you misunderstood me. I\"m so sorry you misunderstood me.\" I quickly interjected, \"there's no misunderstanding the fact that you were rude and you are rude.\" I asked him for the name of his manager and he gave me a blank piece of paper and placed a pen on top of the paper. He then spoke the name of his manager. So I wrote it down and assured him I would be in touch with her. I did follow up with the manager and she was apologetic, but assured me there must have been some sort of communication barrier. I say NO WAY! People can talk with their bodies, actions, jestures, eyes, etc... regardless of the language barrier. This guy was either having a bad day, didn't like Americans (or blondes), didn't like being questioned. As a customer, I feel I have the right to question any charge. I hope some things have changed there. Don't think I'd be recommending this hotel to anyone.

Most places will serve you a few coronetti and coffee but the Ripa puts out a spread that will keep everyone including the italians happy. In fact I am going to Rome again and after grappling with the idea of trying some place new to stay, I ended up booking with the Ripa most especially because of their breakfast. That maybe crazy but it is true... I don't know what very high end hotels in Rome are like but the spaciousness of the Ripa can't be beat because I like a lot of space and storage room. I also enjoyed the fact that I had a balcony to sit on in the evenings after a long day of walking around.

Air con units were obviously added as after-thought, probably after the Central AC (gratings still visible) collapsed and wasn't fixed, light bulbs were busted, walls were in poor condition, bathroom was poorly maintained. The whole of the hotel fa\u00e7ade was undergoing facelift. My shutter blinds ceased to work after the first day... It's all funny ah ah, but for the price I paid, I was moderately amused.

When we arrived in our room, it clearly smelled of stale cigarette smoke. Since we had requested a non-smoking room, I called the front desk and asked for a room change. I was told that no other rooms were available and that all rooms were non-smoking rooms.

The new room was fine until the clogged shower drain caused a flood in our bathroom. Since the shower is modern and has no door, and the shower floor is essentially the same as the bathroom floor, the flood spilled out of the bathroom and onto the carpet in the room. We cleaned up as best we could and then alerted the hotel staff. Because the staff didn't bother to deal with the problem, the carpet stayed wet and we spent the remainder of our stay in a room that smelled like a cross between wet dirty dog and mold.

I advise you to look carefully at the Il Ripa website so that you have a full sense of the vibe of this hotel. For us: it was just odd. We stayed for two nights in October for 190 EU/night. Breakfast is included. The breakfast is a buffet with plentiful offerings. I was surprised to see the coffee is self serve from a Nescafe machine. The breakfast room was pretty crowded and has loud rock n\u2019roll music playing the entire time. Furniture is all white molded plastic. The hotel has about 70 rooms and is located next to what looks like a bankrupt apartment building. Il Ripa is within easy walking distance to the Trastevere tram, which is a small train, that you can take for transportation into Rome\u2019s center. From there you can either walk or will need to figure out the busses to get further. The hotel is ultra modern and minimalistic and tries to be very hip. Upon check in we were required to use a bellman to escort us to our room. We certainly didn\u2019t need help with our carryon luggage, but I guess it was good to learn how the lighting/electric worked. The bathroom has no rods or hooks to hang your towels which seems to be a bit of a paradox for a hotel who projects such a modern/hip image to not be more ecologically friendly in enabling guests to reuse towels, etc. Front desk employees were usually polite, but very reserved. We were in room 317. Our patio had no chair so you couldn\u2019t really use it. The worst part of our stay was on a Friday eve. While we were trying to sleep after a long day of sightseeing the music coming from the disco/lounge area was so loud it was impossible to sleep. Because the hotel has a large open atrium the sound rises throughout the entire building. At 11:25 pm I went down to the front desk in my pajamas and a jacket and requested another room in a quieter location. The front desk employee shrugged his shoulders and told me that it would be impossible to move because the hotel was fully booked. This was loud, loud music. He didn\u2019t deny this fact, or even apologize. After a few more minutes of my rather pitiful requests he did come up with another room offer, but he suggested that it wouldn\u2019t really be any quieter and that if I could just wait until midnight the music would stop. I decided that the hassle of moving wasn\u2019t worth it and returned to our room where we waited until midnight and the music did indeed tone down. The general clientele here appeared to be young Northern Europeans. So, if this all appeals to you, go for it. We just didn\u2019t care for the Il Ripa at all", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brossard, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, large rooms and superb breakfast!!\u201d", "Author": "DonnaandDenis", "ReviewID": "UR87932629", "Content": "My husband and I spent 3 nights here from the 15-18 October, 2010.

I even communicated this to the manager who assured me that the hotel was undergoing a period of phased renovation and this was possibly a reason for some of the issues; that and the fact that you can\u2019t please everyone! My fears were unfounded. Hotel Ripa is easily found by car from Rome airport (most importantly, without having to drive through the centre of the city!) Yes, I agree with other reviewers, it looks dilapidated on the outside-but who books a hotel based on the outside? Stepping from the 40-degree heat into the air-conditioned arty lobby (after a 12 hour trip) provides a welcome relief; the staff is quietly efficient, helpful and polite. We found them useful for bus numbers and queue avoiders at the Vatican too. All requests were greeted with a smile and acquiescence. They also speak a baffling array of different languages so no one should feel lost. I think the only part that we struggled with was the small lift from the lobby as we had to get our (disabled) son out of his buggy to go upstairs, as it was a little too wide for the lift. However, our (very large)room more than made up for that small inconvenience. It was fantastic; spotlessly clean with working and efficient air con, a ready made up cot for my son, a wonderful bed, crispy white sheets and a clean bathroom with all facilities. The cleaning maids were in every day so that, apart from our mess, the room looked great after a day on the tourist trail. (Sadly lacking tea making facilities but that is such a British thing to desire, I think that the rest of the world can cope without it!)All essentials and little luxuries that you expect are here. Food wise, Breakfast is extensive and must cater for almost everyone-except the very picky. I do agree with the reviewer that said the coffee wasn\u2019t great but that\u2019s me looking to provide a balanced review. The breakfast room is light and airy, but I didn\u2019t find it loud at all. And last, but certainly not least: location, location, location. Hotel Ripa is a mere150m from the tram that goes directly into the very centre of Rome. Trastevere is the place to stay in Rome if you want Italian Rome not tourist Rome; it is old, beautiful and offers a glittering array of restaurants and is still only a short walk to the main sights.

We had a huge room which was separated into a bedroom and a kitchenette/dinner/lounge. There was also a balcony and a decent sized bathroom with a bath. The service was great - even the cleaners would smile and say hello to you. The room was clean, and our toiletries were topped up every day. I thought that the bed was comfortable and the towels were soft and clean smelling (i.e. not stinking of bleach!). There were some repair issues, for example a wonky shower rail, a bashed in cupboard door. I get the impression that the hotel is being updated bit by bit as I know that there are nicer rooms, but I don't know that for certain. Presumably there wouldn't be any point in making any unnecessary repairs if the whole lot is going to get pulled out at some point. My criticisms are that the breakfasts were really not good. The coffee came from a machine and just was not right. We were in Italy it was wrong! Thankfully, they did have earl grey!! The food wasn't up to much either, but there were lots of bars around where we could pick something up, so it wasn't a problem. In fact, wherever we stay, we generally end up having breakfast out. There are still the repair issues as mentioned before.

As a background, I booked my stay via hotels.com at an incredibly low $120 a night (Rome in September tends to be rather expensive). Upon checking in, I was given room 119, which is on the first floor and looked like a 1970 East German idea of a cool room. Weird IKEA type decor in a very oddly set-up room. Large enough, but not very functional and rather dark and dingy. Not the kind of carpet I would want to walk on with bare feet. The bed was worst, since I was able to feel each worn out spring. The room was also really close to the elevator and service room, so it got loud very early in the morning. I believe this room is reserved for low-rate bookings via discount sites. Based on this room, it would be a two star rating at best. Upon speaking to the front desk, I was eventually given a different room (#218), which turned out to be 100% better. Much larger (pretty much a junior suite) with a small balcony and a foam mattress bed which was very comfortable. The room even had a small kitchen and the bathroom had better fixtures. It was also very quite. I felt as though I had checked into a different hotel. This was more like a 3.5 star room. Overall, the hotel is in a perfect location right in the middle of Trastevere, which is probably one of the more beautiful areas in Rome. The trolley is a few minutes from the hotel and goes straight into Rome. It also goes to the Trastevere rail station, which will take you to the airport in about 25 minutes for 5.50 Euros. Great deal and very convenient. The rooms have tiny TVs with lots of international stations. Both rooms had safes and desks with two chairs. The breakfast was included and decent enough, though mainly low quality prefab pastries and such. Internet was not included and is extremely expensive (about 25 Euros a day). All hotel services seemed outrageously priced and should be avoided. All in all, your experience will greatly depend on the type room you get. I would try to avoid the first floor altogether and request a room with balcony.

Luckily from the arrival everything well more than perfectly; the staff was always very helpful, corteous and friendly. They did their best to help us with all the problems we had. They took care of our taxi reservation, gave us tips how to get around with the public transport etc. Our room type was \"executive\" so I don't know how were the other rooms but at least ours was very clean, classic Scandinavian style and the room service always cleaned the room very well although we spent 8 days there. Nothing was broken in our room and the room seemed to be quite new. The rooms have minibar, a small balcony or terrace, safety box. For the Internet (also in the public areas) you need to pay. The hotel is situated in Trastevere, near the tram 8 so it is very easy to get around with the public transport, also by buses. In Trastevere you can find very good restaurants with good service and moderate price level. We definitely recommend the restaurants! You can also find some nice shops there. The breakfast was very good, perhaps not so luxurious as I had thought on the basis of the previous reviews but in Finland the hotel breakfast is something overwhelming, so I would say that in the European level the breakfast was excellent. A wonderful surprise was that one evening the staff had brought us sparkling wine and chocolate to our room as my mum celebrated her birthday! A wonderful gesture towards a traveler although for the hotel it does not cost too much, I think. What a nice way to surprise! In general I can warmly recommend Ripa Hotel for the people who appreciate good service, Scandinavian / modern style of a hotel and clean rooms.

The hotel has a sort of art nouveau thing going on, and its internal layout is certainly very interesting. On the downside, it is not centrally located and you will need to avail of public transport to visit most of Rome's attractions from the hotel (however its location in Trastevere puts Ripa in close proximity to several good restaurants and the laid back Roman nightlife). Also, the hotel is difficult to find. It's located two blocks back from the main street, and the website directions for customers coming from Ciampino Airport are misleading; you should go RIGHT, not left, at the votive candles after getting off the bus. You can avail of a good buffet breakfast but can't use trays to collect your food, which can cause frustrating congestion as people walk over and back bringing food to their table.

Our room, a suite with a balcony was, on first impressions, very well presented but it didn't take long to see through this veneer. Firstly, the large room is sectioned off to give a private 'bedroom area' with fitted wardrobes. this is probably a design feaure for those using the room as a a family suite but it left the bedroom slightly too small. The rest of the room which had a small concealed kitchen area and a seating area we seldom used at all. The balcony was a nice touch for some fresh air. Attention to detail would have made this hotel experience a whole lot better. the light switch panels kept falling off, the door architrave was ill-fitting and unfinished and the over-bath shower was so ill-fitting that water ran down the wall and into the holes behind the taps. The hotel is huge yet you never feel that it is crammed. There is ample space at breakfast and we never felt rushed. Breakfast was good enough - buffet style. The hotel is ok and at some of the deal prices is a good place to stay. One feels anonymous enough to come and go as one pleases yet all staff are friendly. Trastevere is certainly the place to stay and this hotel is situated well for the local bars and restaurants. We found that eating in Trastevere was cheaper and better quality than across the Tiber and the mingle of busy thin streets are very romantic with something aorund the next corner for everyone. Bars here are good too. The tram system takes one to very near this hotel (a number 8 from Argentina) and the public transport system is a great way to get around and save your feet.

However, on closer inspection we were very disappointed to find that the rooms had been designed with more attention to a superficial sense of style rather than substance and quality. (poorly finished) All the furnishings and decorations are cheap in terms of their quality. We could not fully unpack because only one rail with hangers is provided. There is no wardrobe or drawer space in the room. Almost everything in the weenie bathroom was disfunctional. (No hooks to hang anything on. No surfaces to put anything on. Bath was pitch black and leaked. Toilet was wonky and wobbly) We asked to be moved as when I picked up the phone, a multitude of spiders ran out from under the ear piece. We were moved to an identical room (even same damp patches on outer wall due to there being no tiles around the bath. Also, there was the same ugly view of a decaying tenement block opposite window. Same family of spiders - this time invading the bathroom and bath.) We did complain about the spiders, but were not given any solution. The longer you stay in the hotel, the more you realise how poorly designed it is. You are given one key for the room with a massive key fob which had to be returned to reception each time you left the hotel (not two swipe cards as you would expect). In order to turn on the power for the room you must plug the key in. However, because the lighting in the corridor is so bad, you are in pitch blackness as you search for a tiny slot in which to insert you key. This is ideal after several glasses of wine! The gym is only a treadmill and bike with a few weights. You have to book it as only one person can use it at a time. However, noone else was interested and I got the use of it whenever I wanted which was very convienient. The staff (apart from lack spider solution business) were very friendly.

I stay boutique, modern and contemporary hotels across the globe and this certainly isn't one of them. Spend your hard earned cash on a better 3* for less money. What a shame... this could have been be a decent 4* hotel, but sadly the designer and architect lack any real flair and imagination, the management have scrimped and saved on the pennies and what you end up with is a poor 3* hotel (certainly NOT a modern, contemporary boutique hotel). Location - I'd describe it as the 'Hoxton' of London - up and coming, earthy and urban and full of young people. The area itself feels vibrant, and this is were all the young people hang out in the evening (some great restaurants and bars near by) and a short tram ride into the centre. HOWEVER the hotel looks like a disused office block and my room/s over looked a disused building. Down and outs live round the corner to the hotel and urinate in front of you (nice). Graffiti dons most of the near by walls. The area is pretty noisy - car alarms woke us up most mornings at 7am and we were kept awake until 4am by shouting in the street. if you are a light sleeper you won't get much rest here. Rooms - nothing like the photo's! Interestingly enough as we checked in there was a photographer in shooting photo's and they had shipped a load of new furniture - this was removed when the shoot was finished (so be warned.... it's nothing like the website)! This hotel and the rooms look like a cheap version of an Ikea catalogue but without the flair or style (if you can credit Ikea with that). The rooms are large, however, why on earth they feel the need to give half the floor space to a cheap sofa (when we sat on it we feel to the ground and it was stained and tired) and kitchen area I don't know. The bed itself was surrounded by wardrobes so no natural light or fresh air could enter the room - it felt dark and stuffy. The designer has lacked any style and imagination (they've tried to be trendy but failed miserably). We were given room 213 - tired and dirty with remnants of the previous guests still under the bed. When you used the 'make shift' shower it flooded the entire room so we asked to move. We were given the same room (614) on a different floor which was the same as the previous. Both rooms had a balcony which looked out onto a disused building. The air conditioning wasn't great so the room was generally very hot and uncomfortable. The toiletries provided were cheap and nasty. The walls are so thin I could hear every word from the room next door (including them taking clothes out of the wardrobe). Breakfast - the standard Italian breakfast by European stands is poor but this was even worse! The chief lacks any imagination and was the same poor, boring stuff every day. Not even fresh juice provided - some watered down drink alternative. Tea and coffee out of a flask, a bit of ham, cold cooked bacon swimming in fat, cheese, stale bread and tinned peaches was the only prepared fruit. There was a bit of fresh fruit on a stand but it was all under ripe and to be honest having paid 200 euros a night it would have been nice if the kitchen could be bothered to chop it up! MTV blasting in the corner so you couldn't hear yourself think and not enough staff to clear all the dirty tables as you were herded in and out like cattle. The staff - my corporate travel agent phoned them up to get me a booking and they were apparently full and wanted to charge more than the advertised rate on the website. However the website allowed me to book (very strange). we were warmly welcomed, but don't bother asking for directions as they are more than likely to be incorrect (as we found on 2 occasions). We did ask to be moved as our first room was so poor and we were however we were put in something just as poor as the first. I had the feeling the staff are embarrassed that your being ripped off with such a poor offering.

The hotel lobby is quite impressive (evenmore so than on the website), with very attentive, competent english speaking staff. We needed money changed on our last night (Sunday), but were too late. A very friendly receptionist went out of his way to contact another hotel - who could not help - then he changed as much as he could using the hotel petty cash.

There was also a balcony with a view of the already mentioned apartment block. Our room was disappointing, as it was not up to the standard I was expecting having visited the hotel website. It was more like an office than a hotel room, and the colours used were dull and uninspiring, and a little grubby in areas. The room though was cleaned every morning - fresh towels and sheets. I would rate the lobby/ reception area as 4 star, but the rest of the hotel as three. The adjoining restaurant/ bar was expensive compared to the great restaurants and bars in the Trastevere area - which is possibly the best area to stay, and eat in Rome. Once you cross the Tiber and approach some of the major attractions, prices tended to be inflated. We decided to walk to the majority of attractons - which could be done with relative ease.

I have stayed 200 - 250 days in hotels all over the world in my job for the last 25 years, so I claim have have the ability to judge good from bad. Trastevere is a great area to stay in Rome.

We had booked a smoking room and were dismayed to find that a smoking room is classed as a room with a balcony that you can stand on (*there's not furniture on the balcony) and have your cigarette on there. OK we thought, not a problem we can deal with this.

The \"bathroom\" is tiny, there is barely room for one person in there and as for storing toiletries well you may as well forget that there is NO storage space. As for wardrobe space you can forget that too as the hotel is classed as a modern boutique, by this they mean cheap and nasty ikea style with no hanging space except a rail and a couple of tiny shelves tacked onto the back of the bed's headboard which incidentally is in the middle of the room!!!!!!

In my case I couldn't open the save box, where was my passport, so that I cold to reception and said that. 5 minuts after then cam a member of the staff and opened it with the \"secret code\": 1234, he told me that it was the same for all save box, ploffff. When I cam back to reception, there was one member of the group explaining that from the save box in his room was stealed 100 dollars, then cam the second with the same history and so till 10 persons, all said that the money was in save box, the quantity were from 50 till 150 usd or euro per person. The hotel's manager said that they had a contract with an insurance company and they will response for that and the company will do the same later. I did a declaration in Carabinieri Trastevere and gave a copy of the document to the manager. At the following day, the manager said that it will be very difficult to return the money, because the insurance company needed to do some investigation about, and maybe in the next (and last day in Rome for us), we'll receive the money. Next day before we leaved hotel I asked about the money (total 1350 US dollars), and the manager told me that will be impossible to return money in that moment for instructions of insurance company. We arrived back to Chile and wrote to the insurance company and they answered that this contract was no more valid, so that they will any money return to us. I wrote to hotel and they never answered. All people in the group think that were members of the staff the responsable for this act, because in almost all room in 4th floor were opened the save box, and token only part of the money where it was, maybe thinking people will not note it if they take a little part of the money. That was my and 68 people experience in Ripa hotel. I have yet all documents about notification in Carabinieri and several emails in my office, never nothing happened and the hotel didn't answered for the theft So, friends, be careful!!

But thats a different story. The free breakfast was below average, with very few cold and stale pastries to offer. Roll A Way bed very uncomfortable, I was up from 1AM to 6AM. The hotel was somewhat close to a river, which if you walk the streets around it, you see actual Rome, like not the tourist part. The staff was HORRIBLE!!! When the taxi was unloading our bags, he did it very quickly, and drive off with my brand new laptop, and ipod and wallet. We asked the hotel to call around to a couple different taxi companies, and they said no.

We had seen reviews- both good and bad. We were so very pleased to find a hotel that met all of our needs for the week we were in Rome. The staff was more than helpful, arranging a van to pick us up at the airport. The rooms were hip & modern, but sparse. The twin beds were most comfortable with crisp linins and fluffy duvets. We had everything we needed, A/C, elevators, phone, Tv, hair dryer, mini fridge, balcony with a view of Trastevere. This area is the 'Ghetto', mostly residential around the hotel. The #8 tram goes to Argentinia, minutes from Piazza Navona. The #3 goes to the Piramide Metro stop. The stop is a block away; the front desk is happy to sell tickets and provide information. So although this hotel is not in the center of everything, it is easy to get to, and provides the feeling of living in Rome. The breakfast was perfect, quite a spread by european standards. Eggs, sausage, several meats & cheeses, pastries brought fresh daily from the bakery. Coffee, hot milk, tea and juices. A piece of fresh fruit in the pocket came in handy later. The staff was happy to get espresso, or warm a baby bottle. The downstairs bar was a perfect place to unwind in the evening. Live Jazz, a casual atmosphere. My niece who is studying in Rome has gone back with friends to 'hang out'. The bartender is a great guy who knows all the out of the way places to spend the day or watch a sunset. We never ate at the resturant- to many other choices nearby. There is a grocery store around the corner, perfect for those last minute gifts of olive oil and wine. There is also an internet cafe around the corner. On sundays the Flea Market, has every thing from flowers to antiques. The only negative, although it added excitment, was the shower. We never figured out how to shower with out wetting the whole room, and I'm afraid the ceiling of the room below us.

Myself and my husband had booked a 5 day break in Rome and were looking for somewhere to relax in the evenings, have a reasonable breakfast and be in good distance of all the sites.. we got all the boxes ticked. Lets talk about the hotel first: - The staff were extremely helpful. They gave us a map and guided us around to point out the good areas, sights, transport and good restuarants. - The room was airy, clean, had a great TV, lovely crisp white linen.. no complaints. - My one bug-bear would be that the shower was not in a good position in the bath and so it was like a mini flood after each shower but that was not a major problem. The water was hot and powerful. Location: - Right outside the door was the number 8 tram which took you directly to the Panthelon from where nearly all the sights can be reached within a 10 minute walk. It was less than 7 mins on the tram to this stop and they supplied the tickets in the hotel which were only a \u20ac1 each. - The Trasvestere area is great for good food at good prices. We ate most nights for less than \u20ac80 for 4 course meal with wine and coffee. Whereas on our last night we went into the main square of spainish steps / Panthelon and dinner cost \u20ac113 and it was only average... the setting was lovely but the price was not so good. Value for money: We paid \u20ac625 for 4 nights accommodation which included breakfast. Compared to other prices I was quoted for lesser star hotels, I believe we got value for money. There was also a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates in our room on arrival The breakfast was substantial enough. We are on the continent after all so anyone who expects a fry up will be sorely disappointed.. but the array of pastries, breads, yogurts, fruit and hams well made up for it.

Reviews seemed fantastic or totally negative. An art deco, modern hotel in ancient Trestevere, Rome? No, I don't work for them and have no ax to grind. with a few minor blemishes, my wife and I used Ripa Hotel as our base of operations for 11 days in Italy and found the owner (who personally welcomed us on a few occasions and who was even working the desk one day) and staff extremely attentive. Food and service way above average. Price: About to eliminate Ripa on price alone, I went to their great website. I booked the reservation through my business account on American Express and asked for and received an off-season 99 euro commercial rate for two people. Note: this was 99 net. No VAT added and no charge for a full, hot, attractive, and lengthy (7a-10am) breakfast. We were in Rome to see our son who is on active duty in Iraq. he took his R&R in Rome where his girlfriend from Fairbanks teachesw English. She and her coworkers in Rome, who joined us in the restaurant for dinner one night, could not believe the price value of this hotel. Ripa is a legitimate neighborhood hangout for coffee and drinks at all hours. The free evening buffet in the bar/cafe means for the price of a cappucino you basically have your evening meal. Indeed this is a middle class-upper middle class neighborhood about 6 very long blocks from the ancient Trastevere Plaza. It is one block from Vial Trastevere and bus and tram which for 1 euro each way takes you within 3 blocks of the Pantheon just across the River at Via Argentina, shops, sites, tour buses etc. All major tour bus lines will pick you up at Ripa Hotel. We made long (13-15 hour) day trips to Naples-Pompei and Florence, and still used Ripa as our base. On Sundays you are literally 100 yards from the famous Flea Market which is a true international bazaar sprawling about 2 miles along the Tiber. The front desk arranged for taxis and a car service to the airport. When our flights were changed and we needed to overnight in paris, they called their sister hotel at Rue Longchamps in paris and booked us a double for 110 euros with a roundtrip car service from Chas DeGualle airport, door to door, for 130 euros roundtrip, about the same as a cab. Ripa rooms are like the Hudson Hotel in New York, except larger. No furniture except a comfortable king bed and nice medium sized plasma TV. A small terrace with two chairs overlooked the City and lets smokers smoke if they want to. The infamous \"odor\" is a sewer line backup in many old Roman neighborhoods which was on the 4th floor for one day and anyone who wanted to change rooms was accomodated. When my son wanted a room for Valentine's day, they extended the courtesy of the same 99 euro rate. Three European companies were holding small conventions and seminars there, and ost of the guests were regulars from around Europe. for students, retirees, or singles--yes and gays--the coffee shop/bar was a hangout for talking football, politics, or just Roman tourism. The dining room, cafe is transformed to a piano bar and/or jazz club a few nights per week. At least one person on each shift speaks English, but many employees do not. My housekeeping staff was peruvian and spoke Spanish but little Italian or English. Ripa is not a Marriot-style business hotel, or a baroque or luxurious landmark hotel. It was re-designed and won awards in 1996 or 1997 and could use a refresher makeover in terms of interior fixtures, shwoers, grout etc. But we have stayed in much, much, much worse hotels in London, Paris, and elsewhere at two or even three times the price. You can pick up free newspapers in the morning, but get there early because there is only one copy of the English language Herald Tribune, Financial Times, or USA Today. Eggs, sausage, bacon, hot rolls, hot pastries, cold pastries, hot and cold cereals, coffees, teas, juices, in short the kind of breakfast which is above the Euro norm of Muslix and a few slices of salami. Computer jacks were in the room, faxes and mail, and packages were delivered promptly, and employees would guide you to a supermarket a block away, digital photo store, laundry etc. finally, a three block walk in any direction, pencil, and paper, will allow you to create a gastronomic itinerary of great pizzarerias, seafood stores--real family style restaurants. In short, every four or five years you find a hotel which lets you feel like you \"lived in a real neighborhood in Rome, or Antwerp, or Frankfurt, etc. My wife and I loved the Ripa Hotel and will return there. So will our son and his girlfriend (who now meets her friends there for coffee, snacks, dinner etc).
