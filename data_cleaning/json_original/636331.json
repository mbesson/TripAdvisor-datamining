It has a tv, the bed is huge, the shower is amazing and we didn't have any problems with hot water. We also had a massive window in the room which was nice. It was near the city centre, only 5/6 stops away on the metro which was quick and cheap if you buy a 24 hr / 48 hr pass.

Some things would annoy me if I had to stay longer than one night - there were only two or three clothes hangers, there was nowhere to put a toiletries bag in the bathroom except on the floor, there was nowhere to put the soap down in the shower, there was no hairdryer and almost no bathroom stuff. I can imagine the lack of a door on the bathroom might be inconvenient if you weren't alone. Another thing that could be remedied is how cold and concretey the lift area is.

The mood lighting is amazing and so is the breakfast bar that you have in the rooms too. On the whole the hotel was goo, but the following points really brought down the hotel experience: 1 - Firstly, Every morning... Well around 11am when taking a shower, (all three days, the shower was cold). 2 - You, cant control your room temperature of your room?!?!? It was a cold room and due to the heating being 'centrally located' it was totally controlled by staff - which made it awkward to go to reception to constantly ask for more heat!? 3 - Me and my partner stayed in one room, yet the beds were to single beds that sank in the middle due to loose support, this meant that we kept being pushed to the middle of the bed, quite annoying after a busy day around town. I think when going to Amsterdam again I would choose the CitizenM hotel for a much better experience - the rooms were clean and suitable, its just these points really brought it down. The breakfast didn't look all that great for 11 Euros but that's an opinion. There are no hair dryers or kettles in rooms, which can also be a pain. Its also easy to get into the centre of Amsterdam by the Number 5 tram, with a taxi costing around 17-20 Euro's. Next time I will choose Citizen M Hotel (a few minutes walk away).", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cCheep and cheerful!\u201d", "Author": "orange63", "ReviewID": "UR125926257", "Content": "Stayed here in the winter of 2008 as a couple.

The rooms are somewhat odd, not sure I'd want to share one with someone else due to the pod structure which means there is no door/side wall on the bathroom area. This is probably fine if you're not a prudish Brit. The bathroom styling is funky, if impractical - no shelves anywhere to put things on for instance.

A long weekend in Amsterdam. From looking on the Website and on TripAdvisor i was very excited about the modern, funky rooms and wasn't disappointed when we finally got there. The room was a good size and the LED lights around the bed were just as good as it had looked online. Was initially a bit worried about the lack of door on the bathroom but i'll repeat what others have said in their reviews. It doesn't detract from the stay at all, the entrance is a different end to the bedroom area so it's not like you're lying in bed looking into the toilet. You get used to it pretty quickly! :) Plenty of plug sockets which is always good, Wonderful powerful shower, lots of towels (we stayed for 3 nights and had a fresh one every day) The staff in reception were very helpful. The location was perfect, a 5-10 minute train from Schipol airport gets you to the train station by the hotel, hotel is a 2 minute walk from the train station and to get into town the Trams go every 10 minutes or so and take about 20minutes to get to Central Station (However we got off at the Museum and walked the rest of the way into town because there was lovely things along the way) When we went all the canals were frozen over, everybody was ice-skating along them. The one negative about the hotel is that our room got very hot, the windows don't open and we didn't have any air con controls but that was about it.

We was told check in wasnt until anytime after 11, however, we wasnt invited to sit down in the hotel or given any friendly information about the area and where we could go meanwhile so we asked to leave our bags there so we could explore the city. We was told to just leave our bags in the lobby which i felt a bit dodgy about as they wasnt locked away. It is about 3 minutes from Amsterdam Zuid station where there is a nice Burger King and two small Albert Heijn stores (supermarkets) where the staff are very helpful and give you as much help as you need. It also takes about 15 minutes by train to get to Amsterdam Central or 10 minutes by tram. You can buy a 24hour travel card for 7euros. When we came back to check into the hotel we was handed our keys and given directions to our room which was on the first floor. When we got into the hotel room there was no electric, when I asked the man at reception why this was, he told me you had to put your key into the electric device next to the door, which would of been helpful if he told me this before we got to our room. The Tv was not in the middle of the bed like shown in the pictures, it was at then end of the bed with lots of visible wires. The stools at the end of the bed are nearly impossible to sit on properly as they are so small! The lights are absolutely brilliant and the wallpaper was amazing aswell, it reacted with the neon lights coming from the bed! I have no complaints about the lights as they just fascinated me! The shower was absolutely lovely aswell, I didnt want to get out of it! Also the matress is one of those mould matressess wich was very very comfy! On two occasions when me and my friend were sleeping, the cleaners just came into our rooms, said something in dutch and walked back out, which was VERY creepy! When i got out of bed to open the door, I asked the man if he came in and he said yes and that he was room service? A knock on the door would of been much appreciated? The vending machine have a wide range of chocolates and drinks, they also sell pot noodle like things for 3euruos but as we didnt have kettles in our room, we had to PAY 1.50 to use hot water, which wasnt hot enough so we then had to use the microwave. We done this on two occasions, and on the second occasion the member of staff who was in the lobby on the computer complained at me for using the microwave and making the lobby smell of burning? NO FOOD WAS BURNT IT JUST SMELT LIKE A CHICKEN POT NOODLE! The pillows are so flat that I had to ask for spare ones, which i was told the hotel didnt have (which must of been a lie, which hotel doesnt have spare pillows?). I was offered a bundle of towels to place under my pillow instead which was not useful at all! The staff look at you like you are on drugs when you speak to them! Especially the main man that was at the reception. We was not told about any of the services the hotel provide eg. breakfast. We just had to look at posters around the hotel and figure out for ourselves. Our key cards kepty breaking and we kept getting given new ones!

The staff were friendly and happy to help when you needed it. The room was simple but a good size, but unless you are travelling with someone you know very well, you may want to consider another hotel as the lack of a door to the bathroom could be an issue. The mood lighting can take a few minutes to master and like most other hotels, the bathroom lighting is not ideal for putting on your make up. There is a full length mirror but bizarrely it is located on a wall right next to the bed, so not exactly great for us girls who would like to see a whole outfit rather than just to the knees. Sometimes I wish hotels would consult women more when designing an hotel room. We just really want a full-length mirror and decent lighting for doing your make up! Oh, and a plug socket close to a mirror for plugging in your hairdryer. But the Qbic did get the plug in the right location, though with a plug right by the mirror in the bathroom, even if the mirror was situated a little bit high up - I am 5'1\". :) A couple of bad points: rooms at the back seem to overlook the WTC bin area and can get noisy in the early hours - we were on the 2nd floor; the room got very warm at times and you can't control the aircon and the window did not open; the room got no natural light due to the location overlooking the enclosed bin area. Although it is located quite a distance out of town, the no. 5 tram which runs every 8 minutes or so takes you straight in in about 10-15 mins depending where you need to be. From the airport, the hotel is one stop on the train. If you need to get back to the hotel late at night, a txi costs between 13-20 euro. Overall, a good hotel that offers something a little different with little fuss and contributed to a great weekend. If you like live music, try Bourbon Street Amsterdam - great Saturday night! Good pizzas at Piccolinos in the centre. The Old Sailor pub in the Red Light District is also good fun and one of the few good places that stay open late on a Sunday night.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGreat price for great location\u201d", "Author": "NausicaaNL", "ReviewID": "UR123272639", "Content": "I needed a place to stay in order to be at an early meeting the next day.

Qbic is a concept, it is like nothing I have ever experienced before in terms of a hotel, in many ways it tries to break the mould of a bog standard normality and succeeds. Check in was a breeze, the staff were extremely friendly, it bore the welcoming of a guesthouse, the comfort of home and the feel of a Marriott that has been kitted out by some rich boy with a love for gadgets and lights. For me it epitomised Amsterdam and the Netherlands, the lessaiz faire attitude, the modern way to do things and the belief in something that is not normal, but great nonetheless.

We first arrived at the Hotel around 11am, we knew we couldn't check-in until 3pm, but they advised the room would probably be ready by 2pm.

Breakfast was an added cost if you wanted it, however we had it on the 2nd day only and there wasn't much choice. Ok if you just wanted tea/coffee, Orange Juice & a croissant. The overall interior of the Hotel was very much in the style of Ikea. The room was quirky, as seen on the internet but our room didn't have any windows which we did find quite claustrophobic. There appeared to be a temperature control system, but you were unable to change it yourself. We did find we woke up very stuffy.....on the upside it is more than adequate for a short city break stay. Staff were pleasant but not overly helpful.

I stayed there with my husband for two nights in early October. We arrived later than expected, at about 11.30pm on Friday night. I called ahead to explain that we would be delayed (impromptu dinner at an amazing restaurant) and was assured that this was fine - the guy on the phone was really lovely and told us to have fun! So that was a good first impression. We got a little lost on our way there, the directions said the tram stop was called Strawinskylaan but now seems to just be called Amsterdam Zuid so we were a bit confused, but eventually found our way to Qbic. We had to be let into reception by some fellow guests as the duty manager seemed to have gone on a break, but he reappeared soon afterwards. Loved the room: the bed was extremely comfortable, the TV had a great range of channels, and the shower was really powerful. I had already seen from photos/comments that the bathroom had no door and neither of us minded, but I imagine it could come as a surprise to some people. Perhaps this should be made explicit on the website? There was no hairdryer in the bathroom which didn't matter to me but does usually come as standard in hotels these days. There was a great buffet selection of food for breakfast, and you can tell they're catering to a youngish market by serving it until 11am. We arrived for breakfast at about 10.50am just to have something quick before going out but were told a bit rudely that breakfast \"was served until 11am, for next time\" by one of the staff - he appeared to have got the time wrong. Not a big deal but might be an idea for the staff just to check their facts before telling off guests! We didn't make use of the vending machines although I thought they were a nice touch. We really liked the magazines and maps supplied in reception. The location was fine for us; being a business district, it felt a bit like staying in Canary Wharf (to draw an analogy from London) and was very quiet over the weekend, so not that easy to pop out to the shops and get something you might have forgotten - but we spent most of the time in the centre anyway. There were train engineering works over the weekend which meant the trains from Amsterdam Zuid weren't running, and we had to take a replacement bus to Duivendrecht (e.g. for onward journeys to Utrecht etc.) but the metro was working fine.

On first arrival, there was no one at reception and I had to phone someone to come and check me in. So I took a seat next to the cosy \"fire\", or rather television with a looped video on it. Looking around, I could see the catering facilities, namely a vending machine and a microwave. The general look of the reception/lounge was that of the big brother house on a very, very tight budget. Walking through to my room through tired looking corridors, past the WTC's security office, the lighting changed to an eerie green glow. A very odd look for public parts of the hotel. The lighting couldn't be more different to the room, I opened the door to find a red light above my head and a \"bed pod\" thing in the centre of the room. Think Ikea does young offenders institution. Integral to this bed pod were a set of LED lights that do interesting colour chasing programmes. Not top of my list for hotel lighting, I'd rather a little sunlight. To my surprise, the shower room was integral to the bed pod. My toilet was about 6 inches away from my pillow and there was no door seperating them. Before taking a poo, I decided it would be prudent to open a window. No such luck. All the windows in this cell were sealed shut. I decided to look out of the window, so stood atop my bed to see over the frosted part of the glazing. And what a view! The bins in the parking garage before me were parked pleasingly straight. Sadly, even after turning of the disco lights, my sleep was not sound as what seemed like the entire hotel's drainage system seems to be plumbed directly into my pod. Still, at least I was reassured that my fellow inmates were a clean bunch, what with the sound of their showers and toilet breaks keeping me entertained throughout the night.

The art work in the rooms and the lights on the bed are funky and the hotel is quiet. The bathroom is round the back of the bed but not having a bathroom door is not an issue because unless you walk around to the bathroom you can't actually see the person in the bathroom, the only disadvantage of not having a door is It that any unpleasant smells soon waft around the room :-( The room we had first did not have a window so we moved the following day to a room with a window.

But next day the very nice receptionist gave me 2 coffee for free and the parking (which is otherwise expensive) also for free, so service was fair. if you travel over weekend, the WTC (World Trade Center) is without any people and the way from parking place to your room is scary and lonely. all doors closed, you need to talk with an operator to open the (4) doors one way. if you like Thrillers, its perfect, other people feel save in such athmosphere, I feel scared :-) room itself is trendy/stylish/modern with LED light, its clean but its only for 1 night., You even have no wardrobe ;-) During check in , ask for a 2nd key (if you travel with a partner) cause there is another closed door on the way to your room.

I had such a good nights sleep here that I overslept and the following morning woke to a knock. I had overslept by 30 minutes but a member of staff was very cool about it and actually asked me how much longer I needed! (with no extra charge). Qbic may seem somewhat out the way from the city centre but as Amsterdam is relatively small it wasn't too much of a problem and actually would be a plus if you want somewhere relatively quiet to sleep being away from the noise of the city. This is definitely a hip hotel and nicely and cooly designed but also would imagine that a lot of their clientele are business types, being located in the WTC and I encountered a lot of people in the daytime who where going to and from work, whilst I was going to and from the Q bic hotel. I didn't find the fact that my room didn't have a window a problem, I would imagine that there is some sort of ventilation in the building.

We only stayed in Amsterdam for 3 nights so we went with something fairly reasonable which was not too far from central Amsterdam. The Qbic was easy to locate, right near the World Trade Center. With a Metro line within a 2 minute walk it's so easy to get into central, it's approx 7 stops on the 51 train, which takes about 15-20 minutes and it's very easy to use and you can get a return into central for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 or and all day travel card (which can be used on trams, metro and certain buses) for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7. As I drove we managed to find a P&R carpark (several are located around the outskirts of Amsterdam) which was very inexpensive for the 4 days. We arrived just before midday (check in is 3pm) but the receptionist was very helpful and managed to check us in to an available double room immediately, which was great news. When entering the room, it was a lot more spacious than what we had expected and also what you may think from photos. For the price, you can hardly fault this hotel. The room is large with a big double bed and a decent sized television. As for the bathroom, there was a large headed power shower, sink unit and toilet. The only issue is that there is no door on the bathroom, just a large entrance, which can leave you very exposed, and may cause slight embarrassment, but we thought it was fairly humorous! However, the hotel does warn you of this before you book, so it's not something that you should complain about. There was an option of changing the lighting in the room, but we couldn't figure that one out, so our room remained blue for the whole of the time we stayed, not that we minded either! Next time we will have to ask, instead of forgetting! We were put in a room without a window, which again, we didn't mind as we were only in the room during the night time. The hotel is easy to access 24 hours as your room keycard allows you access to the main front door, but there always seemed to be a member of staff up at all hours should you misplace your key, or leave it in the room!

The lights in our room didn't work which wasn't the end of the world as I liked the purple but still not what we thought we were getting.

Only 5 minutes from the airport to Amsterdam South is pretty handy and walk out of the station and turn left and you see the Qbic. For getting onto the City it's ok, about 10minutes get's you to the Museum area and Leidesplien (the entertainment area bars bars bars), a further 5 minutes gets you to Dam square which is the gateway to more bars, restaurants, smoking, red light ect. The tram line is about a 1 minute walk from the hotel. The rooms - The whole toilet thing bugged me, they need to purchase doors badly or some sort of screen as it feels uncomfortable poohing with no door and the worst thing is if someone enters the room you on the toilet is the first sight they see. The bed is mighty big and can be done up for two people when requested (although they didn't do this for us). The room is quite spacious and they do like to think outside the box which isint that bad. The mood lights are certainly not as bright as those in the picture and arent annoying, they are different nice. The biggest problem was the heat in the room - the hotel cant adjust the heat and you cant open the windows. I found the staff very helpful and got us a room at 1.45pm, as we had explained that due to delays and getting on wrong trains we had been 8 hours travelling (only 1hr by plane), the usual check in is 3pm. Whilst they have no bar or day time food services there are 2 well stocked vending machines with beer, crisps, potnoodles, soup and toothpaste. Just a quick word of warning - when you try a space cake and get the munchies and get home and get a pot noddle it costs a further \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3 for the hot water for the pot noodle. A few people have also said there is noting around here but in the train station there is a burger king, coffee shop and newsagents and on weekdays there is 2 or 3 food places around the WTC and what looked like a bar also. I liked the hotel and would recommend it with prior warning on the heat issue and toilet situation.

A few people have said they found it difficult to find but it's literally just to the right of the underpass and there's even a red carpet leading up to the door so you can see where it is. When we got in we were encouraged by the staff to come talk to them rather than use the self check-in, which I found to be much more personal and she even suggested somewhere for us to eat. Speaking of which Wagamama's is about a 2 minute walk from the front, which is great although a bit pricey. If you want food at night though, you're kind of stuck.. so I'd suggest getting something outside of the area before coming in if you have a late flight like we did. The lighting was a bit trippy but that's fine as we could just turn it off., and sure, there's no door on the bathroom - but guests aren't under any false pretences before showing up, the pictures clearly show there is NO door. Anyway, just run a tap or use the public one if you don't want your travelling partner to hear you do your business! No biggie. The only quarrel I had with it was that on the Thursday morning, someone started drilling something right in the hallway, then talking really loudly.. a bit of a pain when you've come for a lie in. The bed was AMAZING though. Really comfy and REALLY roomy.. although we had a window, there was no air-con and the window didn't open so my boyfriend got a bit overheated.. Still, overall we both really enjoyed our stay here and are even talking about arranging a second visit with friends. p.s. If you're using the Metro and train. The Metro ticket machines are the silver ones and the trains are yellow! The train ones don't accept notes either, which isn't very convenient when you've not had change to break a note. The Metro is way more convenient for Centraal (Make sure you type in \"Amsterdam Centraal\" rather than anything else) and the train is better for the airport. : ) - Oh!

The first thing you need to know about Qbic is: It was suppose to be a flat apartment and it was converted to a design hotel. So the room is not the usual you expect from a hotel room. But this is not a bad thing at all. The room is clear and the bed is very comfortable. Nice shower. The staff is great. But I felt the room a bit could. Would be nice control the room temperature but the room has no temperature control. The hotel is a bit far away from Amsterdam downtown and there is not much options to eat or drink near the hotel, besides the ones that share the same building and they close early. They have vending machines on the lobby but the things are a little bit pricey. So bring your take away when you are coming back from downtown. They have breakfast for a fee but I not tried it. If you just want a cup of coffee they have a machine where you can grab for EUR 1,50. The coffee is very good besides the fact it is made on a vending machine. It was a nice surprise. Little bit more about location: The hotel is in the WTC Amsterdam Building and steps away from Zuid station.

Also the bathroom lacked a hairdryer and shelves to put stuff on, and when showering the drain could not quite keep up witjh the water so some water escaped the shower cubicle and went to the hotell floor, which is not so good I guess.. The light is cool but a bit inconvinient for longer stays. It took about twenty minutes to go to and from the city centre with the public transportation, and I thought it worked really well. A metro, tram and nighbuss stops maybe 100 m from the hotel at station zuid, so very convinient.

These two qualities are probably enough to sell it as a decent option for 1-3 day stopovers in Amsterdam because you are getting hostal-type rates without the group shower experience, and a really cool bed that glows taking the edge off your Hollandesque binges. The main detractor is the Qbic's location on the outskirts of Amsterdam...where most travelers would prefer to stay in the central district within walking distance of all attractions. However the Qbic is a stone's throw away from the Zuid Tram Station which will take you all the way to Centraal Station in central Amsterdam, or out to the Airport in the other direction. This makes it pretty convenient for those who are traveling by air or train. Best of all is when I traveled on this train there was no charge for the rides. The hotel is nearly all self-service with a check-in check-out machine in the lobby, and an interesting hide-and-seek game to find out which of the 30-some odd doors along the WTC building is the actual hotel entrance (its in the back near the giant bike rack). The rooms are nice and modern, but a little cramped even for two people...but for the value its appropriate and comfortable. As the hotel is effectively the basement of the WTC, there's not much by the way of a windows and natural light, which is why they have adorned your room with lunar lighting.

It is built into the World Trade Center in Amsterdam, fifty yards from Zuid station. So you'd expect a soulless chain hotel with no personal touch or flair, and all mod cons. Both expectations are refuted! Let's begin with the positives. (1) The staff: The staff are exceptionally warm, welcoming, friendly, and obliging. And, in contrast to the big chain hotels, you feel that they really are pleased to help, rather than merely parroting a line from a training session. (2) The breakfast: The \"foyer\" of the hotel is the design masterpiece of the place. It's just lovely. The perfect combination of modern and yet cosy. The breakfast is served here at a strangely-shaped white lacquer long table. It consists of croissants with gorgeous homemade jam, boiled eggs, pastries, cereals, fruit juice, coffee, and an excellent array of fresh fruit -- kiwi, apples, bananas, oranges, strawberries, and grapes. (3) Free fast WiFi: Perhaps this is just taken for granted in some more civilised countries, but here in Europe, it is extremely hard to find. And it make SO much difference. I could check my email, do my work, and plan my sightseeing on my laptop from the comfort of my room. (4) The design: The owners clearly had a field day designing this place. It certainly isn't chic -- which I think is perhaps what they wanted -- because there are just too many different styles of design clashing with one another, but it is extremely fun. And it manages to be a lovely and interesting place to stay. One problem is that the fittings are inevitably getting scratched a little now, and the minimalist design is suffering as a result. But this is a small complaint. (5) The customer service: I had problems with my room when I stayed. Through no fault of the hotel's, there was a lot of maintenance work being done in the World Trade Centre late at night and I could hear this in my room. I complained about this and received an extremely prompt and courteous response together with very generous compensation for my disturbed nights. This was very impressive service. (6) Initially, you think that this would be no good for a sightseer, but in fact if you're a keen walker, the route north to the south side of the Vondelpark makes for a lovely route in to Amsterdam, through an exceptionally wealthy and beautiful part of town. For business people, the location is simply ideal. Zuid station is next door. You can be in Schipol in 20 mins. And you can be in the business district in 5 mins maximum. And let's finish with the negatives, though there are far fewer: (1) Inexplicably, there is no phone in the rooms!! So you can't call reception is something goes wrong! (2) There is no way of controlling the air conditioning/heat in the room. Though actually this was never a problem, as the temperature in the room was always just right for me. All in all, then, I would thoroughly recommend this little oddity to anyone who needs to be in that area of Amsterdam.", "Date": "October 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow", "Title": "\u201cFor young and brave\u201d", "Author": "sandu_18", "ReviewID": "UR47216270", "Content": "If you really love hi-tech style and freedom and do not care about superfluous conveniences, you have to stay in this hotel.

The Qbic seemed like a good choice with its 'Cubi' style rooms with multi-coloured lighting effects such as 'Mellow Yellow, Red Romance or Deep Purple Love\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6' Perfect, it might seem for a romantic weekend break? Sadly no. Room 1: I was allocated a ground floor room which had no door on the bathroom, and no mood lighting. Funky lighting effects aside, even the most basic of hotels and hostels I've stayed in have had a DOOR on the bathroom. No matter how comfortable you may be around your partner, I'm sure most people would appreciate a door to close while they're on the toilet. When I mentioned it to the manager (Kim) she explained that the rooms here were 'not finished.' Yes, NOT FINISHED. Also as there were no other rooms I could transfer to until the next day, we were not able to transfer to a room that was finished. Great. I don't want to seem unnecessarily picky, but I do find it unacceptable to have paid a fair price for a two night stay in the Qbic hotel (booked through reputable Internet-based travel agency Expedia) only to be allocated a room which is 'not finished.' Even a courtesy call or email would have been appreciated but there was no communication about the lack of lighting or bathroom door, and it was not even mentioned when I checked in. It was left to me to approach Kim about it who apologised but explained that there was nothing she could do as the hotel was fully booked. As a courtesy to my girlfriend, I had to leave her alone in the room for 20 minutes so she could use the bathroom in privacy. So there I was, walking around a desolate business park alone just so she can get some bathroom privacy. I don't find that acceptable. Something so simple should be standard. As for the misleading photo of the TV on the Qbic website, not all the rooms have a TV fitted to the wall facing the bed. The first room I was given had a TV mounted to an arm on the wall with cables fully visible (see photos). Room 2: We were finally able to transfer to the second room where I was told the lighting would be working the following day. Still with no bathroom door to be seen, I set about trying to find the controls to change the mood effects from 'Mellow Yellow' to 'Red Romance' - after a 10 minute search and not being able to find the controls which (although not working) were easy to find in the first room, I went downstairs again to enquire how to change the colour with the manager. He explained that the controls were actually now hidden away and if I wanted to change the colour, I would have to open up the cabinet where the TV was housed and there should be a controller inside. Asked if it would be able to change colour automatically (as the first room's controls suggested) - I was told no. I would have to select the colour by opening the cabinet and manually changing each time. To do this I had to lift up the mattress and prize open the metal door to reach the switch. In the end I gave in and just left it on one colour, preferring not to keep removing the mattress just to have a new effect. The bathroom was smaller and its floor was metallic, not like the first room. I also noticed how thin the walls are by being kept awake at 4am by people laughing in adjacent rooms. To be fair to this hotel, it has its good points: it is very close to Amsterdam Zuid station and one stop away from Schipol Airport, it provides a decent breakfast of cereal, croissants, pain au chocolate, coffee, orange juice, fruits and yoghurt (for 10 Euro) and it has free Wi-Fi in all rooms, as well as a communal iMac with internet access in the reception area. There are vending machines providing chocolates, drinks, and basic dry food like noodles and it is easy to get to central Amsterdam on the number 5 tram. It would be perfect in fact for a single, business traveller who simply needs a room for one night (providing they are not disturbed during the night by other guests). However, if it's a weekend break you have in mind (perhaps with a partner or friend) it has many flaws. The financial district at the weekend is like a ghost town. None of the restaurants are open beyond 9pm (I tried to eat at Wagamamas at 9:30pm and it was closed) so if you want to eat in the evening beyond then, you have to either have to go to a more central location, phone for a delivery, or buy noodles or chocolate from the vending machines in the reception area. The management weren't particularly helpful in this area. What is painfully apparent is that the managers are overstretched between checking the rooms, acting as receptionist, organising check-in and check-out and handling breakfast duties. There really needs to be more people in attendance. If they are not around you have to phone for them which (although appreciated) is not ideal. My advice to anybody wishing to stay the Qbic is to phone and email ahead to make sure they will be allocated a room which is finished with bathroom door, and lighting as pictured on the website. I would also advise to bring earplugs if you are sensitive to noise from the surrounding rooms.", "Date": "August 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cNice modern hotel,clean,good value for money\u201d", "Author": "amsterdam0709", "ReviewID": "UR36700334", "Content": "Great service, although we couldnt check in early (our flight got in at about 8am), they let us leave our luggage in the hotel so we didnt have to lug it around all day.

As other customers already stated, it was not that easy to find it at first, since precise information is lacking in the description of the hotel when you book it: for foreigners they should more clearly indicate that you must enter the building to find Qbic. My partner and I appreciated the overall setting of the room: the 'cube' is functional, with comfortable bed and chairs, but what was most annoying was the absence of door separating the bathroom from the rest of the room. Ok, you get a sort of open space cubic room, that is nice, yet adding just a panel would not have spoiled the whole concept! When asking the staff about it, the girl just answered that most of the customers were business travellers, people alone, so that usually nobody does not mind. She added that we could use the public bathrooms situated on the floors, but considering the price you pay, it bothered me not to have a real private one! Now about the possibility of changing the light of the room: at first we thought that the switch was broken so we asked the staff. They said that the button was indeed difficult to find and came to show us where it was. It was in fact hidden in the part where the TV screen is, behind a panel. And it may be a detail, but again, this is not mentioned anywhere, while on the door of the room, the hotel boasts about this function.

A Full Honest Review.\u201d", "Author": "katjad", "ReviewID": "UR30788641", "Content": "After a lot of debating, me and my husband booked ourselves to the Qbic hotel in WTC Amsterdam - there are cheaper and more centrally located hotels about; true; but the pictures of the hotel and the surroundings, talks of easy transport and again, the pictures of the hotel convinced us that this was the one for us. The hotel was relatively pricey at roughly \u00c2\u00a395 per night, but we did book at a rather last minute so the price was what we were expecting anyway (and on the same level as the more central locations). I'm not sure who's fault it was, but I used a debit card to book the hotel, and it seems they reserved the money and then charged it - a normal procedure for a credit card but sadly not for a debit card - so the whole sum of the booking was deducted from my account, but also remained \"earmarked\", reserved but not collected. I contacted booking.com (through who we booked the hotel), the hotel themselves and my bank, and everyone simply spread their hands and said \"we can't do anything\". The hotel only saw the one charge that had gone through, booking.com didn't know anything and my bank was simply useless. It took a week and several phone calls for the reserved money to suddenly reappear back to my bank account, and I'm still none the wiser as to how that happened. So my advice is to use a credit card when booking this hotel, or using booking.com. We arrived to Amsterdam around 19.30, and bought a 72 h BVB ticket for the duration of our stay. This set us back \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15 per person, but it is definitely worth it considering the location of the hotel. The tram to use is the number 5, which you can catch right from the front of the Central Station (should you not take the train straight to the Zuid station from the airport - we didn't). The tramride takes about 15 mins, so not long at all, and the views during the ride are fantastic so the ride doesn't really get taxing. Most of the sights of Amsterdam are on the line 5 anyway, so this tram route is very handy for everything. Embark at the Zuid station and behind you - lo and behold, is the World Trade Centre, in which the hotel is. The hotel is located in the C-tower, which just happens to be right in front of you when you turn to face the building from the tram stop, so it is very easy to find. Don't go down the stairs - there is a entrance on the wall facing you and this is the quickest way to the hotel. After office hours and during the weekends you do need to buzz yourself in, but this is usually the practise with other hotels as well after hours, and we got in very quickly once we buzzed at the door, so we didn't find this to be a problem. Once you are in the lobby, take a left and you see the sign for the Qbic hotel - it is easy to find. Don't be fooled by the TNT delivery service place that you have to walk through - you are on the right path. The hotel is experiencing some renovations at present, the check-in place and the lounge are now situated on level 1, once passed the TNT space just take a left and the elevators are there. We didn't have to use the self-check-in service, the girl working there checked us in and was very helpful and nice. Our room was on the second floor, so we went up again and to the long corridor on which all the rooms were. The walls are painted and the lighting was green so it did look rather groovy - and easily spotted from afar if one was a bit confused if they were on the right path to the rooms. On the opposite side from our room, down the corridor, there was some maintenance work being done, and it wasn't covered very well if at all, but we didn't really mind as you don't really spend your time in the corridor. The room itself was wonderful. Airy, massive windows, and most importantly; clean (I even did the black-sock-on-the-floor test and got no dust - excellent). The bed is the comfiest bed I have ever slept in while in a hotel and the comfy chair in the room is just brilliant. Our moodlighting was, I assume, broken, and we were stuck with blue, but there was enough of natural light from the windows, or from the 3-4 normal lights in the room to not mind. Now, the rumours are true, there is no door on the toilet, so if you are squirmish about your bodily produce, you might want to ask your partner to leave the room (or use the toilets at the elevators) but we didn't mind this, suprisingly, I didn't hear a thing and no smells stayed in the room either! After a shower the room wasn't damp or moist (in our opinion) and the mirror cleared from mist very quickly. The shower itself is a small level lower than the toilet area, so water shouldn't really get to the floor there (there are plenty of towels on offer though should that happen) The wifi works perfectly and is very quick - quicker than in your avarage hotel offering free wifi. There is also a safe in the room if you want to leave your valuables there. No cupboard for clothes, but a clothes rack with hangers and lots of space to lay them elsewhere (there were 2 chairs that we utilized). Also, there is a flat screen telly on the wall of the bed. Our Cubi unit was, unfortunately, just a little shabbily done, it seemed not all the panels were on the same level, in the shower there was only a little hole on the floor to srain the water (no drain net or anything) and the moodlighting wasn't operational, but we didn't think this was such a massive let down that we wouldn't enjoy our stay. Furthermore - we didn't get disturbed by other guests at all; didn't hear anyone through our walls or anything, it was actually very peaceful and relaxing. You might hear a few voices when people walk down the corridor or slam their doors, but other than that - not at all. The lounge area is amazing, we really liked it. There is also a microwave if you bring your own food, you can ask for plates or cutlery from the staff and there is also a coffee machine, and self-service units to buy drinks, crisps and the likes off. We didn't have the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10 breakfast, I didn't even see it but my husband said that it was all continental (fruit, cereal etc) and for an English bloke, that's just not enough. You can get a more substantial breakfast for the same price from town, and as already established, it's not that far away. Also, for those who smoke, or have come to Amsterdam to smoke - be aware that the rooms are non-smoking and the windows are difficult to open, if the can be opened at all. But on the level 2, if you continue past the hotel entrance (also the entrance to the TNT space) there is a smoking area, which is open 24 h a day. Also, for those wanting a night out, and are put off my the fact that the last tram comes here around half past 12 in the night, if you have bought a GVB pass, this is also usable in the night busses, and these are really easy to use, on the tram stop there is a map and timetable for nightbusses, only one comes here and it follows the tramline, so it is very easy. All in all, we really liked the Qbic hotel. It definitely is an experience not to miss, but we doubt we would go again. This is by no means a statement against the hotel, we just would rather stay in a completely self-catered flat next time we go. If they paid a little more attention to a few details (like perfecting the Cubi-units, hiding the maintenance and construction work, be a little clearer where everything is etc) this would be a perfect hotel for anyone wanting to try something different and really enjoy a hotel that has cool enough rooms to hang out in.

The hotel turned out to be by far the best value we found in the extraordinarily over-priced Amsterdam hotel market. The Qbic keeps prices down by being a sort of DIY hotel. You check in and out with a credit card swipe - there isn't really a lobby or a concierge. Room service consists of a 24 high tech snack machine (complete with a decent beer selection). However there are a few helpful staff members floating around to answer questions if you need them. There's also free wifi and a free computer in the \"lobby\" area. The hotel is in an office building, which means there are no windows in the rooms - but Qbic makes up for this with cleverly designed rooms and funky neon lights. The whole experience is meant to be post-modern and kitschy and it succeeds. The real highlight of the joint is the price. We paid $89 US for a room that was vastly superior to anything else in Amsterdam for under $100 (you can't even get a youth hostel for that price). We only booked one night at the Qbic because we were concerned that the location would be annoying. Later that week we needed to find another hotel room and ended up wandering all over the center of town looking at overpriced dumps and wishing we had booked another night at the Qbic. The fact is the location, right inside the WTC office buidling, is not pretty. You'll need to take a 15 minute tram ride into the center of town whenever you want to leave the hotel. But the tram stops right in front of the WTC building and runs late. Frankly I didn't mind the tram ride, particularly once I discovered how superior the Qbic rooms were compared to rooms in the center of town. I would also recommend Qbic over an airport hotel, as the WTC location is much more accessible by both tram and rail.

My stay will provide me with the most ridiculous travel story I have to tell and I want to share it with you and as many people as possible. Here you go: After realizing on late arrival in Amsterdam that I would have to go directly to my meeting and check in later I called Qbic and asked if that would be a problem, already being confused that the hotel seemed to be in a closed compound without direct street access and, very important for me, no obvious place where a cab should pick me up. Well needless to say I was told that check in at around 11pm would be no problem whatsoever. On trying to talk a cab driver into taking me to the WTC he adamantly wanted to tell me that there is no hotel in the compound and nevertheless proud me to an entrance to a very lifeless architectural structure. I rang a bell at 11.02pm, entered and the real story begins here. Finding the hotel in the empty, lifeless lobby-like structure is somewaht possible if you are brave enough to conquer a space that seems very empty and as if you are trespassing every step of the way. One can find the approximation of a reception though, eventually, I did around 11.10. It is all machines, very 2001, unfortunatedly the checkin machine was not working and I was refer to the clerk, who was nowhere to be seen. At around 11.15 I started to call the phone number on my reservation paper. I spoke to somebody in Maastricht who told me that the situation I was in would be impossible that I couldn't be all alone in that compound, yet: I was and after he was somewhat convinced of my desperate need for a bed and my right to have one due to the reservation numbers I gave to him, he gave me a telephone number to call. I did and was perplexed when the phone right next to me in the empty machinery scenery began to ring. I was so surpised to pick up....and hear myself on my cell. I called mastricht again, got another dose of disbelief and eventually a cell phone number. I called that number at around 11.30, wandering around in the empty modern wilderness, thinking about Jim Jarmush and Will Smith in I am Legend and thinking of hitting one of the sofas while waiting for someone to answer that cell phone. Well nobody did. It was Maastricht again, they told me to go back to start. 11.45. Now what do you do in the middle of nowhere with nowhere to go to. You think about your early flight out, 6.50 and how precious minutes of \"sleep\" are replaced by anxiety and amusement. And you swear that you will fire your secretary and tell everybody and their dog that Qbic is not a concept but a fraud. Obviously when thinking to oneself, one uses another kind of language, not advisable to rephrase those words here. So thoughts about home cross your mind, you look out of the windows into an outside that is as empty and desolated as the strange inside you have to share with...machines, nothing else, just things, ticking away. Ring, something like a elevatorbell from where the checkin machine was! You run back, and: a person welcomes you, sort of. Nice guy, you hate him immediatedly but he actually is so nice that you forgive him and go to the room taking the card from him and preparing yourself for what a hip hotel might be like. It is like a officers cabin on battlestar Galactica, maybe, with lights so that the junkies can't do the fix, kind of fancy. Well after 4 solid hour I begged for the nice person to have fullfilled my only dream, to organize a cab for me to take me to the airport. The cab was there, the driver asked what i was doing in the building this time of day, didn't want to belive that there is a hotel inside, I kind of got his drift and agreed and was happy thinking about home. Only downside to the ending: because there is no street, the cab charges you 7,50 Euro just for waiting in the noman's land for you. I gave them to him, even now I can hardly believe my welcome at the Qbic Amsterdam, why should he believe that there is a hotel at the WTC with guests who might go somewhere from nowhere? I was asked if the stay was less than perfect, well, most certainly so! Do not even think about punishing the night clerk, he was the best thing in the whole bizarre scenario. I didn't fire my secretary either. For all others out there: Do not go into that thing that misnames itself as a hotel unless you like the kind of experiences sketched above. best regards", "Date": "December 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lisbon", "Title": "\u201cWon't come back!\u201d", "Author": "Paulo P", "ReviewID": "UR21856572", "Content": "We were very curious about this concept Hotel in Amsterdam.

A taxi ride in Amsterdam can, I believe, be very expensive while the train costs you about 3,5 euro. We were amazed by the big wtc building being so empty, we had to buzz ourselves in. Thought the hotel advertises as being a self service hotel, check in and check out using food machines, there was a very welcoming staff member who told us to ring him whenever we got stuck. The check in actually went easily. Once int the room we were amazed by the space and the furniture.. the Qubi. Looked realy cool and when we asked the staff member to change the lights he set all kinds of cool colours for us. The hotel itself is very easily reached by public transport and there are even night busses pendeling from midnight till early morning, again savinf you money. After a wild night of going out in Amsterdam it was great to stay in a nice and relaxed neighbourhood, away from the big and loud city, just 15 minutes away. We only wisehd we could have stayed in our bed longer since check out is 11.00 am. The only negative thing about hte room is that the toilet is open and that means not eating too much onions and beans, haha.

Located in the southern business area of the city, it is easily reached by train and tram from Schippol and Centraal Station, with no stress. If you are coming directly from Schippol, I would recommend taking the train direct to the hotel (8 mins - \u00c2\u00a33.50 Euros at Aug 08). Disembark at Station Zuid (sometimes called Amsterdam Zuid on the electronic ticket machines) and look for the WTC main entrance. Another tip - buy your train tickets in the arrivals area of the airport where you collect your baggage,and avoid queues in the station adjacent - you can use cards and cash in the machines. If you prefer to travel direct into Centraal Station, you can then pick up tram no 5 (just outside on the main plaza) which takes you to Station Zuid, and is roughly a 15 minute ride, though it is more cumbersome on trams with luggage than the train. I would recommend using the GVB information office outside Centraal Station (the white building around the scaffolding) for your travel passes, but remember to take a ticket and queue up! For a 96 hour city-wide tram pass, its 17.50 Euros, and is money well spent. The area around the hotel is very quiet at night, and we had 5 nights uninterrupted peace. There are a couple of cafes in the locale, and we preferred these to the hotel breakfast which was 10 Euros. We were impressed with the overall aesthetics of the hotel, size of rooms, and staff's attention. The bathroom designs have been covered elsewhere, though I will say I found them a little dark for shaving! Having stayed in Amsterdam numerous times before, I found the area to be pleasant, safe, clean and quiet, and would definitely use the hotel again.

Toilet - I have no issue with no toilet door but the lightings is so dim that I could hardly see myself (the room I was given had dim green lightings in the toilet, so maybe other colours are better - I am not sure. I am not sure about you but the idea of a toilet seat being attached to the end of my bed (separated by a panel) isn't exactly very exciting for me. I was here for 4 nights and to be honest for \"big business\" I rather use the public toilet located on every floor. 2. It's a little far from the town centre, about 15 to 20 mins tram ride. The tram you should take is number 5. Positivies: 1. Polite staff (especially one of the young male staff, really friendly and not intimidating. The other lady staff was a little more cold but polite) 2. Unique deco (minus the toilet experience) 3. Relatively clean and modern 4. Relatively safe as it's located within the WTC building Conclusion: If you have additional budget to spare, choose another hotel; otherwise this is quite value for money (as you know hotels in general in AMS can be really expensive).

FACILITIES The room is great! bigger than most 3-5* hotel rooms we have stayed in and definately different... The lighting is good, with a constant blue colour, or groovy disco alternation between other colours. Reception was pretty good, with free internet, vending machines, books, seating area, and usually someone there to ask. LOCATION 10 minutes from Schiphol, and about the same from the city centre by tram. As part of WTC complex, it has excellent links, with a station for metro, tram, train or bus links. We bought a 3 day GVB ticket (Tram, Metro, Bus) for 14.50. Once there, Amsterdam is easily walkable, with attractions to suit all tastes. DOWNSIDES We stayed from Saturday - Monday, and over the entire weekend the WTC building was completely deserted (I mean, like a ghost town!!). This meant buzzing in to the building every time, and again at some automatic doors once inside. It doesn't sound like much hassle, but becomes rather annoying after the 3rd time! Checkout is at 11:00 so naturally we wanted somewhere to leave our luggage while we spent our final day in Amsterdam. The duty manager told us to leave it in the foyer as there are no lockers big enough to hold suitcases. This was fine with us as he assured us he'd be there all day - he was not there when we returned and the next duty manager seemed surprised when we pointed them out to him! It would be nice to have known they were safe in a locked room and not just left unattended in reception. All over, I give this hotel 4 stars for its cool interiors, great value and convenient location - it's only downside is its slightly annoying access during the weekend/lack of storage.", "Date": "February 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amersfoort, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cAmsterdam's Secret Airport Hotel\u201d", "Author": "brianc_li", "ReviewID": "UR13251908", "Content": "For those wanting a cheap and easy Schiphol stopover this is well worth considering. Of all the 'Airport' hotels there are only three in the central Schiphol area. To access any of the others you have to take a shuttle bus. This hotel is a five minute walk from Amsterdam Zuid station from which there are frequent trains running the eight minute journey into Schiphol central. I booked this place because we had a 7am flight out so needed to be in Schiphol by 6. In my case I set my alarm for 5.15, left the hotel at 5.35, caught a train at 5.48 and was in the airport at 5.55. This is faster and more convenient than pretty well any other 'airport' hotel. At \u00e2\u201a\u00ac69 for the night it also represented excellent value. Whilst I didn't spend a lot of time in it, my room was surprisingly spacious. It is a bit spartan in some respects. Pretty well everything the room has to offer is contained in the integral bed/bathroom/sitting bar unit pictured above. That said the bed was comfortable, there was a decent choice of TV programmes and the shower was good. What it sorely missed was any kind of wake up alarm system. There is no phone in the room and you couldn't set anything via the TV. Given its location and potential customer base this is, to my mind, a major oversight. Given its location in a commercial area to the South of Amsterdam I would not recommend this to anyone visiting Amsterdam as a tourist. The nearby Artemis is a much better hotel and often has similar rates. Even that, like this place, is a bit far out of the center of town.

The location is not in the centre but the metro is very frequent and connects you to the central station in 15 mins. Actually I thought it was better not to stay downtown as Amsterdam can be very noisy and somewhat dangerous at night. The only inconvenient I had was with the parking: the Hotel website doesn't say that parking in the WTC is not included and that it costs 3,60 euros per hour (external) or 75 euros per day (internal)! I was arriving there on Friday evening and I knew that the WTC was closed over weekends, so I assumed that the external parking was free as well. But when I called the reception to have a confirmation, they told me that the parking (internal or external) had to be paid for also on weekends and offered me to park inside with a special discount for \"only\" 29 euros/day. I was clever enough not to follow their suggestion and I found an external parking lot with a meter: I just had to pay for one hour (3,60 euros) and could stay until the next Monday morning.

This is the first Qbic Hotel, and I think they made a few mistakes with their 'hip hotel' concept in this first attempt, but overall the idea is a good one.

Once inside the staff helped me check in. There always appeared to be staff present in reception, which is decorated in a very funky Ikea style. I was lucky and had a room with a window, which offered much needed natural light (though not much of a view). The room was very clean with a large comfortable bed. You can pick different mood lighting, but this is more of a novelty than practical. The bathroom is a bit odd, all open, no doors, must be a bit off putting if sharing the room. The shower is very strong, but the water does not drain at all well and can slop over the sides into the toliet area if you take your time. Also, the showerhead is set at around 6 foot, which makes it a little impractical for tall people (and the dutch are very tall). There is no loo holder or towel hooks, strange how the little things niggle you after 6 nights. Finally - I had no cupboard space, only a coatstand with coat hangers Plus sides are the size of the room (huge for Amsterdam); the easy access to Amsterdam (trams and metro system, or less than an hours stroll along the canals); the price is incredibly cheap for Amsterdam if you book early enough; the staff are friendly; the rooms are in a quiet location (though some building work is carried out over the weekend, this being an office block); the rooms are new and modern, without sagging beds and worn carpets!
