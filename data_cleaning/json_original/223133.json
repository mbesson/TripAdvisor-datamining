My wife and I had reservations for a romantic getaway this past weekend ,which turned out to be just after the departure of Hurricane Issac ,and when we arrived a large part of the city was still without power (the French Quarter however still had electricity).It was a little spooky making our way through some of the darkened streets on the edge of the Quarter but when we got to the hotel it was like coming home. Our room was a king suite ( but was priced well below what such an accomodation would cost elsewhere). It is a quite old property and has the patina and subtle odors that such places have but is clean and lovingly maintained and staffed by folks who obviously have a great deal of loyalty and some serious longevity as to their times of employment there. Everything worked in our room and it was clean and comfortable. The bed was excellent though I could have perhaps wished for a little softer pillow but that is honestly the ONLY thing I could criticize. I slept 'like a brass idol' to quote Mark Twain. I have stayed in many newer places but never in any place that grew on me in such a way. It is on the edge of the Quarter near Esplanade Ave. and only two blocks from the best - the real - music scene in the area ; Frenchmans St. It is very close to Jackson's Square and Cafe Dumond as well as many other small excellent restaurants that the great and knowlegable staff directed us to. It is far enough from the wildness of Bourbon Street that if you are a bit older and like your visit to be on the quieter side this is the place for you. Of course all the other stuff the French Quarter is famous for is not too far to be sure ,but after a day of running the Quarter or a night of incredible music, to return to this cool quiet cocoon of rest was a beautful thing indeed. So to sum it up: if you are someone who needs the very newest and shiniest modern accomodations look elsewhere, but if , like us , you have a sense of and a love for this one of a kind city this place is quintessential New Orleans. If I could give them ten stars I would.

The hotel is old, but well maintained. Ac worked fine. The ice machine is on the first floor, but just get some on your way up. If I had to list any cons they would be this: little musty smelling probably due the age. I would pull up all of the carpet.

I have chosen the hotel following some great reveiews, and I can tell that all in all I have found the reviews quite adequate. Indeed, the staff are friendly, I mean, if they are not too tired. Each person has its own criteria upon judging a hotel, and I would like to add here my own. For me personally it is very important that the room will have curtains to prevent any light in the morning, or else I tend to get up too early. It is also very important to have no noise, none from the adjacent rooms. Le Richelieu definitely meets these criteria, and it has wonderful beds, not too soft - as is the case with hotels that are somewhat dated. To anyone considering the hotel I would advise to carefully check those hidden costs, like the cost of parking. We have been very disappointed to find out that what has been sent to us as 'rate per day' did not in fact include 30 dollars for the children. The hotel confirmed a reservation for 4 people but only in the small letters was it mentioned that there is extra cost if there are more than 2 people in the room. Add 20 dollars per day for parking and you will find that the cost of staying at Richelieu is much higher than is appropriate for this kind of hotel. And, yes, we have during the visit entered other hotels and equired about the rates, and definitely have the impression that ours was all in all a bit too expensive by comparison.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. John's, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNothing fancy\u201d", "Author": "JimP68", "ReviewID": "UR137121760", "Content": "First time here, the staff are very friendly and check-in was hassle free.

The location is great. Away from the loud noise of Frenchman and Bourbon but just a 10 minute walk to the entertainment. Who should stay here? Friends, solo travelers, couples and older families. It's not a great hotel for kids or teenage partiers because this is a quiet hotel. Also, the pool has no shallow end (shallow is 5 feet!) and no lifeguard, so young kids really can't swim here - which was a bonus for us adults!! We were loving it! Staff: All the people on staff are really nice. You have to leave the key at the front desk every time you go out (not that they chase after you). I thought it would be a big inconvenience but it actually worked really well, especially when my friend and I got separated. The maid was also so very sweet. When we slept in, she'd leave a bag of fresh towels and toiletries hanging on the door. We even left something in the room when we checked out and she rushed out and gave it back to us. They are very thorough with daily vacuuming and fresh towels everyday. Very clean place even if the tiles and paint are a bit old and worn. Pool: It's saltwater and makes your skin feel so great. It's very deep. I was on my tiptoes in the shallow end. Night swims are awesome because the pool is lit up at night. The staff won't mind as long as you are quiet. The courtyard is beautiful, with a little banana tree and a resident Monarch butterfly. Food: Didn't eat here because it was too pricey. Rooms: If you want a stylish new hotel then why did you book this? The pictures show it is old fashioned. I thought it was charming. There are some cracked tiles and things, but they had recently painted and we were blessed with an alarm clock with an ipod dock and a nice flat screen TV. The beds are very comfortable and soft. And the AC is quite cold! Complaints: very few. The water doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drain when you're showering so you end up standing about a foot deep in water. I was told this was because NOLA is below sea level. Don't stay in an adjoining room (108) if you want quiet. You can clearly hear your neighbours through the wall, but most people here are quiet and respectful. We only had a problem 1 night. Book a room with a balcony if you want to go swimming, as the bathing suits didn't dry well inside. I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat! The staff is great - and the owner, although he is 89, still walks around and chats with guests. He's very sweet, although he repeats himself a lot. The people who stayed here also all were very friendly and welcoming. We chatted with lots of travelers from all over the States. It's a really nice spot for solo travelers because of the friendly, conversational vibe. It's easy to make friends here. For a unique and relaxing trip, this is a great spot.

I even pre-paid for the lodging because it was a lower rate. When I arrived at the hotel, I tried to gain access into the parking area which is secure but there is an intercom. I pressed the button and a woman answered, asked my name, and said I did not have a reservation. I had my car parked on the sidewalk, running, and she asked me to spell my name again. I did. She again said I did not have a reservation. I told her that there was a mistake, asked if she would open the gate to the parking lot to let me in, and she said, \"I'm not allowed to do that.\" I drove around a few blocks so I could park on the street (which, if you know anything about the French Quarter, is next to impossible most of the time). I went into the lobby, gave my name to the clerk, and she said that she did not have my reservation. No apology at all for the incident when I was trying to gain access at the parking lot using the \"Check-In\" buzzer and intercom. I told her that I booked online and prepaid and then she asked for my identification (like I was perhaps using another name???). She took my driver license into a back office and was gone for about 5 minutes. She came back out, without my license, and said nothing. Silence. No explanation. No empathy. When I asked if they had my reservation, she replied, \"we're checking.\" Another five minutes passed and another woman came out of the back office with my driver license and said that they had my reservation and that it was pre-paid. Geez, I thought to myself, this is exactly what I just told the clerk 20 minutes ago when she said she \"wasn't allowed\" to let me in the parking area. I felt like I was the only person who thought that there was something wrong with this because there was no apology and no explanation given. Then I was told that the parking was $20 -- and really, one of the big reasons I stayed here was because, for the last 20 years that I've been staying at this hotel, PARKING HAS ALWAYS BEEN FREE. Ok, so now I'm being told that parking is $20/day but the woman from the back office told the clerk to comp my parking. At this point, I felt like the whole place had gone crazy so I just recapped my experience to the two women. Then I was told if I had given them the confirmation number on the email that I had received, they could have found my reservation better. OK - let's see ... I booked on the hotel's very own website, not Priceline or hotels.com, and now it's my fault that they couldn't find the reservation. I told them that this was a big inconvenience and it wasn't handled very well. In a very dismissive way, the woman from the back office said, \"we've changed ownership and we're very sorry.\" It seemed insincere and half-hearted, especially since I had to practically drag this out of them. Then the clerk asked me for my credit card and I asked what she needed it for and she said that the remote that controlled the parking lot access gate that she gave me needed to be returned and if it wasn't, I would be charged $20. Then the clerk piped up and said, \"Sir, it's customary to have a credit card on record.\" After the horrible manner that I was \"greeted,\" I couldn't believe that this woman was talking down to me and telling me what was customary, especially since I had only asked a question -- I didn't refuse to give a credit card -- I was merely asking what it was going to be used for. Anyway, I got my remote and key and went to my room. It was around 2:30 pm or so and when I got upstairs, there were 2-3 housekeepers all sitting in the hallway. I guess it was close to quitting time. Wierd, but no big deal. I got into my room and, to my surprise, I had been upgraded to a suite which was nice but certainly an empty gesture considering the torture they had inflicted. Apparently renovations are underway which isn't mentioned anywhere that I could see. Electric saws during the day time and their workshop is the 8-foot wide breezeway from the parking lot to the hotel so you have to step around the workmen and the construction debris. Yes, the hotel needs some renovations but the staff needs a makeover. Honesty, hospitality, full disclosure, making sincere apologies -- all things they should learn. I usually stay at Marriott properties but have had a soft spot for this hotel and it was the exception for me. Not any more. I'm done with Le Richelieu -- but here's a warning to anybody who books: Be very careful about your reservation and avoid pre-paying.

Our room was very nice, albeit the bathroom was not modern and a throwback to the 60\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s but it was very clean, very big and lots of room to move around which is more than I can say about some of the more modern hotels where the bathroom is big enough for just one, this one, you could have two..maybe three people using the sink and counter space and still have someone taking a shower, it was that big. By the way, water pressure was perfect always had hot water, and there was a nice brand of bar soap, shampoo (no conditioner), lotion and shower cap, there was also a hair dyer. The room was old world and very welcoming, and we had a balcony which added to the charm of the room. The room was perfect for us, but if I had to complain, the bed is a little on the hard side, but not so much so that I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep, however the linen was nice, not hard and scratchy but of decent quality, the pillows were a little flat but that was because I think they were goose down, but there were extras in the closet which by the way, also had ample space, two suitcase stands for the foot of the bed or wherever, an iron, ironing board and mini refrigerator to stash leftovers and drinks (no mini-bar). There were extra chairs and a flat screen and table. It was all we needed plus the curtains were heavy, so if we wanted to sleep in we could do so in darkness. Checking in was a delight, we were warmly met by Molly, she was very helpful and cheerful. We arrived early so Molly let us store our luggage, gave us a map, showed us how to get around and was just wonderful. You do also have old fashion keys, not cards, and have to hand them in and pick them up every time you leave and come back, it was never an issue, and if you have been to Paris, some of the hotels there have the same thing, so it just added to the old world French charm to me. I loved Molly, she would cheerfully greet us when we came and went and would ask about our day, she was great! We did have breakfast at the hotel and the meal was perfect, the coffee perfect, all was served by Billy who was really nice and attentive and there was also Darren who came by with coffee refills and to make sure we were a-ok. I had a ham and cheese omelet with a biscuit $9.00 and my boyfriend had crepes $6.50 both of us had coffee and I had a small orange juice, our total was $16.90 which I thought was very reasonable for an elegant hotel breakfast in the French Quarter, and breakfast is served until 2:00 p.m. so it beats running around looking for a late breakfast place, besides, the food and service are excellent. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m telling you the hotel staff is stellar, they are always on hand to help in any way and our check-out was a breeze as well, Aryany was very nice and checked us out and again offered to store our luggage since we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leaving for the airport for still a few more hours. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drive but I know there was a car lot somewhere behind the hotel, not sure of the price but there were always taxis out front if we needed one.

Although the hotel offers 80 some rooms & suites, the facade is quaint with a long communal balcony. The tall windows and doors sport wooden shutters and the wooden balcony is edged with - what else? - a wrought iron balustrade. The centerpiece of the interior courtyard is a rectangular swimming pool that is surrounded by attractive landscaping and plenty of tables and chairs. The hotel's restaurant and bar has a glass wall opening onto the courtyard. Restaurant guests are served either inside or poolside according to their wishes. The restaurant servers are true professionals who are attentive to your needs. I noticed that locals frequent the restaurant for NOLA style business breakfasts. It is true that no one offered to carry our luggage to our room, but I wasn't expecting this given the hotel's affordable price. New Orleans was quite hot and humid during our stay, but the hotel's HVAC kept us comfortable. I appreciated having an iron and ironing board already in the closet.

So, the woman happily told me she would get me a king size bed at the same price.. on Christmas, no less! I had read varying reviews from about how charming the hotel was and how nice it was to how old and disappointing it was. I didn't know what to expect. Upon arrival, it was indeed an old hotel. One of the oldest in the city as a matter of fact. The floors in the hallways were uneven, the elevator ancient and smelled like axle grease. The wall paper in the elevator lobby was peeled off the wall as it was being repaired. I was a little nervous about it until we entered our room. It was fantastic. A wonderful surprise. We were booked in a suite! There was a full living room, a kitchen (the stove and oven were disabled for safety), a seperated bedroom with walk-in closet, a bathroom with a closet and a coat closet upon entry into the suite. We also had a private balcony. The room was very nicely decorated and we were elated! We paid much more for far inferior rooms on this trip. The staff was very nice. You do have to turn your key in to the front desk if you leave because they are real keys, not the key cards newer hotels have and they don't want you to lose them. Fair enough, since most people go to Borbon Street and do well to find their way back, let alone keep up with a key! The hotel is located close enough to anything in the French Quarter to walk to, about 2 blocks to the French Market and a nice walk up the river or to the Quarter and Bourbon Street. We walked all over without any problems. I highly recomment this gem! True, it's not a new, modern Hilton, but it is very nice for a change of pace.

We always had to get out of the car and ask for permission to enter the lot. The man who is supposed to help with luggage was sleeping in a chair. The desk clerk did tell him, as we were checking in, that he had a personal call at the desk, so he got up and took the call, and then promptly sat back down and shut his eyes. No assistance was provided. During our 4 day stay, we are supposed to receive 2 sets of coupons for various things, such as free drinks at the bar, breakfast, and Cafe Du Monde. We only received one set and had to request additional sets. Had to pay for coffee in the a.m. Usually hotels offer free coffee, however, I noticed one person pay $1.50 for a styrofoam cup of coffee, another paid $2.00, and I was charged $3.00 for a cup. Our tub had to be plunged every day because it wouldn't drain and there were times our toilet would run constantly and wouldn't flush. Internet service was absent...completely! People were walking around the pool trying to pick up service on their laptops. There was none to be had. My husband talked to 3 different desk employees on 3 separate occasions to give them our experience in trying to sign on...no one seemed to care much. One man in the lobby was very upset about not having internet and vowed never to return. A lot of business people stay there, so I would assume many people were not too happy about the lack of internet. Will we return?...no! Actually, they lost me the night we checked in.

It has a small bar/dining area that looks out onto the courtyard pool which is very pretty, and a nice place for a quiet breakfast if you want to eat on-site before heading out for a day of sight-seeing. The rooms as well as the public areas were clean which is the most important factor. The hotel also happens to be haunted, which we didn't find out until checkout time when I asked the front desk clerk if the reason my bed was shaking (2 out 3 of the mornings) was due to any earthquakes in the area and her reply was \"No. Half the hotel is haunted though but I didn't know the room you were staying in was one of them\". This would have only made me more inclined to stay there though, had I know ahead of time. The bed shook for about 10 seconds at the same time each morning around dawn. I opened my eyes the second time and saw nothing there...Overall, it is a nice hotel for the price and I would definately stay there again.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portsmouth, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cDual experience in the Quarter\u201d", "Author": "Fijman", "ReviewID": "UR119252017", "Content": "I stayed at the Le Richelieu in the Quarter and loved all of the people working there - very friendly, helpful and genuine.

Ordinarily, we stay at the Le Pavillon, (THE benchmark NOLA hotel in our opinion). But we decided to take a chance and try something different. Plus, we wanted something a bit closer to the Quarter, but still on the quiet side. Well, Le Richelieu definitely fit our bill. So many of the reviews made the hotel sound like a dark, dank, moldy hole in the wall. This could not be farther from true. Sure, it is an older facility--an old apartment building if I gather correctly--but it was far from dank. The only \"stuffy\" smell we encountered was in the elevator, which we only took once. After checking in with the very friendly hotel staff, we took to the second floor--room 220-- and opened the door into a literal apartment flat! Now, we had explained that this was our 16th wedding anniversary trip, and asked for a balcony room. They said something about upgrading us, and I guess this is what they meant. This room was huge! Nice living space with couch and two chairs, plus 27 inch LCD TV, kitchen with sink and fridge, huge walk in closet space, and nice bedroom with a second LCD TV. Though the couch was not very comfy, the bed was wonderful. Both rooms had crank-windows that opened out onto the pool courtyard, which was beautiful. Even when children were splashing in the pool, it was a quiet and serene room. The only grip I had was the Mockingbirds that started up at about oh-dark-thirty every morning! There was no offer of anyone to help us with our bags to and from, and parking is now $20 a night. Nevertheless, it was easy to get from the car to the room. My wife was a bit miffed that the toilet paper was empty after a room service, but we scrounged up a roll from a closet. Overall the rooms were very clean, and the furnishings nice. As the hotel is situated on the eastern end of Chartres Street, it is an easy walk even to Huck Fins way up Decatur, Desire on Bourbon, Frenchman Street Jazz, Felix's, or the River. And, as it is in the more quiet section of the Quarter, you will be scarcely aware of the fervor going on around you! The pool and associated bistro was fantastic as well.

The hotel itself is quintessential New Orleans; absolutely elegant, yet showing just a bit of age, rather like a dowager, a bit past her prime, but trying all the harder to make up for a few wrinkles and gray hairs. Staff from the front desk to housekeeping were all friendly, helpful and efficient. Our room had a private balcony that opened onto Chartres Street. We slept soundly each night with the balcony doors open to the night and the occasional sounds of the Quarter. The hotel itself is located in a quiet section of the Quarter, an easy walk to just about anywhere one would want to go. Another plus is the free parking for guests. A highlight of our trip was a visit with Mr. Frank, the proud owner of the establishment. this courtly gentleman regaled us with stories of the celebrities who have stayed in his hotel, including Paul McCartney, whose family lived there for several months while Paul was recording with Wings in New Orleans. The walls of his office are covered with inscribed photos of happy customers posing with this lovely and gentle man. Breakfast and lunch are served on the premises, room service is available, the bar is open until midnight and one will not feel like a stranger. Many people find the bar to be their daily gathering place, and they all go out of their way to make a stranger feel included in their conversation. The pool area looked lovely, but it was just a tad too cool for us to take a dip--and New Orleans has too many other adventures awaiting the visitor. I could not recommend the Richelieu more highly.

Everything else in the city was all booked up -- so after reading other reviews, thought that this should be an OK place to stay. First impressions - we arrived late on a Saturday evening and the hotel looked historical and charming from the outside, nestled along the far edge of the French Quarter. The lobby was nice, and the check-in went quickly and smooth. I was surprised that the room key, was in fact, an actual key. I wasn't told during check-in, but later found out, that you were supposed to hand the key in at the desk before heading out each day. Obviously this raises some questions with security...and in fact, out of several times handing in the key and getting it back, only once was my name checked against the room records. So it seemed it could have been very easy for anyone to claim my key. Nothing was stolen, but still, it left an uneasy feeling. Aside from the exterior charm and the decent lobby, this hotel is just straight up run-down. The hall floors were just showing their age, looking dirty, and the furniture in the halls was just dinged up and beaten up and again, just showing its age. Not exaclty a charming look on the inside! The common areas need some TLC. Our room was in a word - awful. Updating would go a long way to making the furnishings nicer, although there was a nice newer TV in the room. The carpet was just kind of damp and the room smelled musty and perhaps a bit like mold. The bedspread was dirty and old looking, and although there were no bugs present it wouldn't have been a surprise if there were some. The bathroom, while showing a little bit of updating with newer looking tile, also featured a door that wouldn't stay open without help from a trashcan. Just like the rest of the room, the shower wasn't a place you wanted your bare feet to meet the floor. The positives of this hotel are its location in a quieter part of the Quarter and of course the free parking. The parking lot attendant was friendly and this was a nice feature. Aside from the location and the parking - I would reccomend looking elsewhere for accomodations unless there's nothing else available.

Location : The hotel is in a residential street within the French Quarter, just a few blocks from Jackson square.

It's an ideal spot to venture along the amazing streets with Decatur Street being one block away and an ideal starting point. Rooms : Although a small room it was clean and comfortable if a little basic. The price was very reasonable, especially compared to other NOLA hotels and was a major consideration after location for choosing Le Richelieu, providing us with tv, iron, fridge, wifi, air-con and parking (essential for us on our road trip). You don't go to New Orleans to spend much time in the room but ours was pretty good. Staff: Reception staff were very friendly and gave us good advice on places to go, taking the trouble to mark famous spots on one of their maps. Additional : The on site parking was very useful and with no extra fee made the hotel a bargain. We didn't try out the pool but it was a great extra and we did sit around it with a few drinks from the bar during the evening.

You are in a very attractive location, close to Frenchman St. which has great jazz clubs for tourists and locals, your close to the French Market, St.Louis Cathdral and Jacksons Square, the lakefront street car, and great restaurants and shops. We walked around the whole French Quarter and Uptown such as Magazine St and St.Charles, and when we got back to our hotel, it felt like home. Its got a very home-y feel to it, the staff \"Richard\" is the most kindest man ever! He will do anything for his guests. My sister and I were having some problems finding a calling card to call home, and he offered to use his cell, which we did, and were very greatful for! Thanks again Richard!! This hotel has a salt water pool which was nice after walking around in the crazy summer august New Orelans heat! The bartender and waiter at the hotel bar/restaurant were super dooper nice all the time. The hotel is clean and some have balconies which was nice. There is really nothing negative about this hotel. We had some loud neighbours one night and that was unpleasant, however, we turned up our air conditioner to block out the noise. The beds and pillows were soo comfortable, I slept like a baby. I fell in love with New Orleans, and if I ever go back, I will stay in the same hotel. Things to do in New Orleans: Eat breakfast one day at \"Le Envie\" just one block from the hotel Go to: \"The Spotted Cat\", \"DBA\" and \"BMC\" all Jazz clubs were you will enjoy some wicked jazz music and great crowd. Check out Oak St. and the restuarant \"Jachi-mos\" and order the crab and alligator cheesecake...its an appitizer and it is the BEST thing ive ever eaten. I cant believe how good that was! On Tuesdays \"The Maple Leaf\" jazz bar/club hosts a famous band, sorry the name escapes me now. Coopes Restaurant on Dacauter St and order the Jalepeno and craper poppers---s ooooo good and I kept getting the Crawfish and Tasso pasta in spicy alfredo sauce and its was yum yum! Le Envie is a cafe and they serve really good breakfast. We took the trolley along the lake Mississipi to Canal and walked around Magazine St. and St .Charles. We took the free farry to the other side of the river. What else can I tell you. Amazing food, people, music, and city.

The Le Richelieu is perfectly situated any activity in this location. There are also great restaurants within a couple of blocks of the hotel I can particularly suggest Cafe Envie for breakfast and El Gato Negro for Mexican Food (wonderful, fresh ingredients and amazing Mojitos). Any old hotel in the Quarter is going to be a bit disheveled (that's part of the charm), but the Le Richelieu is cleaner and much better kept than any other I've experienced.

My partner and I visited NO in June, 2009. We had a lovely time. First, our flights were delayed and we did not check in until 12:30 at night. An elderly man named Connie was at reception and checked us in no problem. The room was clean and has a quiet, working air conditioner. Also, one of the best arts about the hotel and our room was the communal balcony. The balcony surrounds almost the entire building and is accessible through almost each room. *Make sure you request the balcony. We met nice people and shared drinks, stories and advice about the tours (swamp tour is a must). The hotel was so helpful, we left every single person a tip upon our departure. Because every person working there was literally that helpful. They booked our tours, and restaurant reservations and called cabs for us. The pool was also nice, however the most shallow point is just under 5 feet...so if bringing children you may want to consider a floating device. Next, about the decor...yes this place might not be your luxurious Hilton, or Radisson...but I did not find the wall to be paint chipped or with droopy wallpaper. It is an older hotel in which I find gives a place character. The location of the hotel was great and it was quiet...even with the communal balcony(I'm a light sleeper too). The rooms were cleaned daily. The TV worked great..not a HDTV so a bit dated yes...but reception was clear and honestly who goes to NO to watch TV. I have not stayed at other hotels in NO as I have only been the once, but my partner and I are planning our next visit next summer and would not stay anywhere else. Also, they have a safe at reception for valuables (if needed) but they do require you to leave your key at reception each time you leave. I actually like this because then you dont have to worry about losing or forgetting your key. Also, Bourbon street has cheap drinks but I found it to be quite trashy and only stayed on the street for 10 mins of our entire vacation. Where it IS at is Frenchman street.

Yet it was an easy walk to the French Market, the riverfront, Canal Street and the Faubourg-Marigny district, full of inviting nightclubs and cafes. And there is a great coffee house, EnVie, half a block away. Our room overlooked the interior courtyard and pool. It was fine for our needs, though we would have liked two queen beds, rather than two doubles. The bathroom could use an overhaul -- it was pretty dated -- but functional and very clean. The free wi-fi in our room was very temperamental: at best, it was slow; at worst, it just didn't work for moments on end.

I decided to try it again with my boyfriend for our romantic vacation to New Orleans. We were not disappointed! Reservations and Check in: We reserved the hotel room online on the hotel's web site. Take advantage of their package deals. We got a sweet deal where we booked 3 nights and got the 4th free. We also got two free drink coupons for the bar, and two free breakfasts (one for each person). With this fourth night, it was the cheapest deal in the Quarter. Check in was prompt and we were given the key to our room. Their key system is old-fashioned and pretty European in the sense that you have to turn your key into the desk when you head out - I liked it. The Room: We were in a room right next to the elevators, but we wouldn't have even known it. Our room was a king room with a window facing the courtyard area (though the view was a wall, but we weren't there for the view). The bathroom and bedroom were both spacious and there was a bonus large walk-in closet! The walk-in had a fridge. The bathroom had a linen closet. Overall, it definitely exceeded our needs. However, I must warn you if you are one who demands the newest, hippest decor. The decor is definitely dated, but it added coziness to the room. Also, the TV had a very limited number of channels. However, the internet was complimentary and the parking is FREE! Service: The staff is absolutely fantastic. The housekeeping staff kept the room clean and even called us to see if we needed anything on the days we decided to sleep later. The desk staff were great and knowledgable and called us a cab when we needed them. They are very knowledgable about the area. The cafe staff were very friendly and we were totally comfortable when enjoying our delicious breakfast! Location: I like the location a lot because it is on the edge of the French Quarter, nice and removed from noisier parts of the Quarter (Bourbon, etc). However, it was only a few blocks (3-4) from just about everything. It is also very easy to get to as it is close to Esplanade (a 2-way street). Again, you can't beat the free on-site parking. Many other hotels in the Quarter charge $30 a night to park. You can't beat this hotel! Also, take a look inside your room's desk for postcards from the hotel.

I will start out by saying that I am from NYC and am picky and sometimes high maintenance :) but for my first trip to NOLA I didn't want to stay at a cookie cutter luxury hotel (apologies to the W and both Omnis), I really wanted to stay at a place with true character and history and Le Richelieu delivered. My friend and I stayed on the 4th floor (top floor) in room 410 with two double beds. It was small but truthfully W hotel rooms are the same size or maybe smaller, so it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us. The room was absolutely spotless the entire visit and we left housekeeping a nice tip as a result (not something I always do). Some of the other reviews are correct, though, the bathroom was straight up outdated and needed a complete overhaul, HOWEVER the bathroom, tub included, was immaculate. The beds were completely fine but if you're a pillow snob or require a special pillow, bring your own, they weren't great. The policy of dropping off your key every time you leave the hotel seemed weird to me until I found out that NOLA is the missing persons capital of the world and the key policy helps ensure your safety. Definitely a great thing for two girls traveling alone. The key return policy also led us to Le Richelieu's GREATEST asset: Becky at the front desk. I have traveled quite a bit and have never encountered a sweeter, more helpful and charming front desk person. Becky booked tours for us, checked in to make sure we were having fun, gave us restaurant recommendations and sometimes just cracked us up. She's a native and her adorable accent alone is the worth introducing yourself. We are planning on taking our guys back for a long weekend in the Fall and will definitely be staying at Le Richelieu again! On a foodie note, I have a few restaurant recommendations: Dinner at Herbsaint in the warehouse district was fantastic! Dinner at Bayona was like an A- but a great atmosphere, Napoleon House has a fantastic Pimm's Cup (their signature cocktail) and muffeletta sandwich, and Magnolia Grill is the PERFECT breakfast spot. Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Du Monde has long lines an dis the Magnolia Bakery equivalent of NYC, but worth stopping by once if you have time. Avoid: Commander's Palace unless you like seriously outdated \"old people food\"...in a word, it was gross. Make sure if you want gumbo you go to the Gumbo Shop and NOT the Old Coffee Pot down the street (we learned the hard way) and Stella is completely overpriced (dinner for two was over $200) and maybe a B at best. Maybe. Stuff to do: Frenchman Street (walking distance from Le Richelieu) will delight and amaze with the quality and variety of music clubs. Our walking tour through the garden district was beautiful, the caretaker's tour of Lafayette Cemetery was super informative and the Vampire tour (ask for Jonathan with the long hair from Haunted History Tours) was at night and will thoroughly entertain and probably freak you out a little bit! We tried to avoid tourist traps and did so quite easily and ended up 2 out of the 4 nights at Jean Lafitte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Blacksmith Bar sitting at the piano bar listening to great music by candlelight.

Even if you turn off the air conditioning in your own room, you can easily hear it from the room next door. Also, everyone talks about the cleanliness, but I didn't find this to be a particularly fresh and clean hotel. Also, I had a very negative experience upon arriving in my room in that is not necessarily the hotel's fault--when checking out the second floor balcony, which is a shared balcony, I was approached by a man wasted on some substance who literally chased me back into my room and stood leering outside the balcony door. It was terrifying! I would not recommend this hotel for single women who would want to access the balcony. Also, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who is sensitive to cigarette smoke, as there are no specifically nonsmoking rooms. Perhaps this hotel is a good deal for smokers, many of whom I found enjoying the pool during the day. As for value, I thought it was a reasonable deal, but then I saw the room of my friend who was in NO for the same conference--she paid $79 per night by shopping online through Orbitz or some similar site and had a charming, very very clean room with a central courtyard pool and lots of character, in an even better location.

I read the Trip Advisor reviews and was looking forward to a quaint hotel with accomodating staff. I must say that I was not impressed. Yes, the location is great. Close enough to everything in the Quarter and just far enough to offer a quiet retreat from the fun and noise of Bourbon Street. The rooms are clean but in need of serious updating. A prior poster hit the nail on the head when they wrote: \"A simple quiz to judge how much you might, or might not, like Le Richelieu: You walk into a turquoise bathroom (even the toilet is turquoise), and see that, while being clean and very well-maintained, the main fixtures appear to be nearly 40 years old. Do you think (A) \"Wow, how cool!\" or (B) \"How dated and awful!\" If your answer is B, then Le Richelieu might not be your ideal hotel. \" Consider me in the \"B\" category. My room had a musty smell and was just outdated. The tv for example had to be 30 years old. Also, I could't believe that the hotel still uses actual keys for the rooms. Nothing wrong with that but the key is attached to a gigantic piece of plastic making it hard to carry around when sightseeing. It was more like a key you'd get when using a gas station restroom! Another minor issue, no lobby pc for printing out airline boarding passes. The front counter tried to accomodate but was unable to print my pass. I didn't find the staff very accomodating either. They seemed annoyed when I asked them to (attempt to) print a boarding pass. It just seems the hotel needs some upgrading to bring it into the 21st century. Over Memorial Day weekend I was in NOLA and stayed at the Hotel Monteleone. Now there's a great hotel that has successfully maintained a historic look and feel while keeping up with modern conveniences.

If your answer is A, well, then it's definitely worth checking out. While our bathroom was retro-cool turquoise, we did get a peek at another one that appeared to have been recently updated, so they're not all time capsules. But we loved ours anyway. Our room on the 4th floor was clean, roomy and had a shockingly large walk-in closet, complete with iron and ironing board, which would make it a great room for an extended stay. Also, while at least one recent review complained of being able to hear activities in an adjacent room, our room seemed quite well sound-proofed. We never heard anything from neighboring rooms, and even people in the hallway sounded a bit muffled. We could, however, hear a folks out on balconies on the floors below us (the 4th floor lacks such balconies) on a couple of occasions when they got a bit boisterous. Maybe the person who had the noise problem was in a different wing of the hotel. Street noise also wasn't much of an issue. The hotel is located in a quiet, largely residential corner of the French Quarter. This location makes for a nicer experience in many ways, but might not be convenient for everyone. It is quite close to Decatur St. and the Frenchmen St. scene over in the Faubourg Marigny. But it's a little bit of a walk to Jackson Square, more of a walk to the more raucous part of Bourbon St., and a real hike to and from Canal St. But you can hop on the nearby Riverfront Streetcar line to ride over toward Canal St. One thing I would note is that, even though we were there in mid-April, our top-floor room got a bit warm in the late afternoon, and we didn't have any real control over temperatures in the room, but we did have a window that actually opened. Especially with that window, the heat wasn't a problem for us, but I might have mild qualms about it getting too hot on the 4th floor if I were staying here during the summer.

This is not a big hotel and I can imagine people either thinking it's charming or a bit run-down. It has a small outdoor pool that is not heated.

Also, the rooms do NOT have individual heat control. The entire hotel is heated to one temperature. Our room had an overhead fan and as well as a fan that we mistook for the heating element. The room was a tad warm during the night. The television is a very old, small model that had less than 20 stations and no movie options. The room was adequate - not huge but we didn't feel too crowded. The hotel is on the far side of Chartres Street, a bit away from everything so it was quieter. It's closer to the French Market than the busy center of the French Quarter. I figured the hotel had to have something going for it since Paul McCartney stayed there (and based upon the pictures in the manager's office so did Barry Manilow).

When we opened the window for fresh air (the room was quite stuffy and warm) we could hear the kitchen staff talking and laughing. To make matters worse the window would not fully close, there was a large gap between the two sides. The air conditioner, even on high, put out very little cool air. The towels and sheets were rough and threadbare. The television set seemed to be from the '70s and was sitting on top of a dresser. The hotel is not remotely close to much of what you go to New Orleans to see. The best thing I can mention about this hotel is a young man named Jim who worked at the reception desk. He was most helpful and informative. My husband and I travel extensively and try to be careful about our choice of lodgings.

So you might feel it \"smells\" old, but I don't think it would be a real problem, as you can take it as one of the \"special\" things to live in such a house with history.

One thing worth mentioning is the door (or should I call window) opening toward the big balcony. That certainly added comfort when we chatted in the morning breeze. 4, Service: Room is cleaned everyday on time, and clean towels, complimentary simple toiletry are provided. The staff in the lobby are really helpful. They answer every question we have, assisting us in booking tours, choosing restaurants, shopping around... and they even gave free bottled water to us upon our late arrival (oh, forgot to say there is no coffee machine in the room, so you have to buy enough water/coffee to stock in the room).

I was pleasantly surprised that such an old building, (built in 1845) was so well maintained. The rooms are high ceilinged, but with ceiling fans, central air/heating, new carpeting, plumbing, TV's etc. (If you're looking for spotless chrome and ceramic fixtures, go downtown to the Marriott) The twin french doors lead out to the second floor lanai (do they call them that in Nawlins..?) that wraps around half of the building. I even saw my first jazz band come sashaying down Chartres Street, not 5 minutes after checking in, from the same lanai. Impressive. On the eastern edge of the French Quarter, you're far enough away from the bars and noisy night life, but still only a few blocks from the same bars, restaurants and sights (couple of blocks from the River Walk, French Market, etc.). You can take the trolley ($1.25 exact change), which just started running following Katrina, the 1/2 mile to downtown and the \"big\" hotels and Harrah's Casino. Or, just walk the River Walk to the Aquarium, shops and restaurants along the way. There's a small bar and restaurant in the hotel that serves breakfast and lunch and faces the tiny pool in the center of the building. Nothing special here, so walk the 1/2 block to a couple of nice restaurants (Daisy Duke's for one) that serves beignets and coffee to those not so inclined to fight the crowds at Cafe du Monde. Everyone at the hotel is friendly and helpful from the front desk to the maids. Everyone seems to be a long-time employee who treats you with care and pride.

This hotel was the only hotel which offered free parking and was close to all the action. My husband and I prefer to stay at highly-rated B&B's because hotels are just so damn cookie-cutter, boring and predictable. On the other hand, my dad is extremely budget-conscious. He refuses to stay at B&Bs, tending to be perfectly happy to stay at a Best Western --- the cheaper, the better! So, you see, we had to traverse a wide gap in taste. My husband recommended we stay at Le Richelieu because it provided free parking (thus pleasing Dad), and I very reluctantly agreed. It turned out that Le Richelieu satisfied all of us perfectly. It was a standard hotel, so it pleased my dad, but it had its own peculiar New Orleans charm and character, so it ended up pleasing me and my husband, too. The lobby has an elegant 1950's/1960's New Orleans ambience. (The elevator reminded us of something one would have used in 1960 -- in a good way, not a bad way.) We had rooms which opened up to a long New Orleans balcony/gallery overlooking a quiet street. The rooms were standard hotel fare -- aged, but very clean and comfortable. Cable TV. Quiet rooms. The hotel's front desk was both helpful and friendly. There was a charming small bar/lounge area and an inviting pool downstairs, too, though we didn't use either. My father had a problem getting all the channels on his TV set and with his toilet. He immediately reported the problems to the front desk, and when we returned to the hotel later in the day, both problems were fixed. Attentive, prompt service. Le Richelieu is within walking distance to the activities of New Orleans, but it's far enough away so that it is QUIET. No loud partying! In fact, we explored a nearly NOLA fringe neighborhood we would have overlooked entirely if we had stayed elsewhere, and we were charmed by it. (Note: Try to eat at Adolpho's, a restaraunt near Le Richelieu. One of the best meals we had in NOLA, and also far less expensive than those we enjoyed at Brennan's and Anaud's.) We will happily stay at Le Richelieu again. Highly recommended, especially for those seeking a reasonably-priced hotel in New Orleans with free parking. By the way, here are some things we enjoyed about New Orleans and would highly recommend to others: The Hurricane Katrinia Tour provided by Greyline Tours, Lloyd Sensat's walking tour of The Garden District (Historic Walking Tours), The Presbytere, Mother's Restaurant, Brennan's (friendly staff and good food), Adolpho's Restaurant --- and just walking the streets of NOLA. I loved the cafe lattes and beignets and people-watching at Cafe du Monde, though it was strange to see Vietnamese waiters everywhere..... We don't drink but it was still great fun to walk down rowdy Bourbon Street at night --- and we were that much happier to return to the peace and quiet of Le Richelieu later on! There are some things we felt were over-rated by Frommer's, We could have skipped this: Arnaud's (great food, but very loud and its house band is permitted to move from table to table, encouraging diners to buy their CD), Felix Oyster (across from ACME), Johnny's Po Boys, the ghost tour recommended by Frommers (Historic Walking Tours?). The swamp tour was fine, but only if you feel the need to explore a swamp/marsh once in your lifetime. We only touched the surface of NOLA in 4 days and look forward to returning soon! The highlight of New Orleans is just walking the streets of New Orleans and taking in its charm. Le Richelieu is the perfect base camp for doing just that.

The bedspread and curtains were a little old-fashioned for my taste, but the third-floor room was a good size, very clean, lots more storage space than I needed for four days' worth of clothes. And even tho I had a rock-bottom summer rate thru Priceline Europe (booked thru Tripadvisor's search engine) they gave me a room with a lovely little balcony. There was no place to sit out there, but it was marvelous to step out and survey the roofs of the French Quarter, and I could keep the doors open and get lots of fresh air. The little courtyard pool was lovely, and the staff was very nice. I had dropped my cell phone in the hall as I was checking out, and when I ran back upstairs to look for it, one of the housekeepers told me \"Oh, my mama found it, she's down the hall.\" I thought it was nice they had a mother-daughter team -- although that might be one reason the housekeepers were a little loud out in the hallway in the morning! I didn't mind because I lived in New Orleans up til Katrina and for me, it was lovely hearing the cadences of those voices. The one thing I'd complain about is that I'd had to park my car in their lot across the street after coming back late from a club, which wasn't a problem, the attendant was keeping an eye on the street. But they called me twice on Sunday morning -- once from the desk, once from the parking lot -- asking did I want to move my car now. Well, no, I want to sleep. There were still other cars there around noon. Obviously the people coming home latest are going to want to sleep in the longest, so they should maybe tell people if there's a reason they want the car moved back to the main lot. I would've been happy to leave my keys with one of the attendants, who were very nice and provided a sense of security. All in all, the location could hardly be better -- in the quiet part of the Quarter and close to the Marigny for nightlife and coffee (also had a great bagel w/ lox as well at Cafe Rose Nicaud on Frenchmen).", "Date": "July 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kernersville, NC", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "NCMagnolia", "ReviewID": "UR8222956", "Content": "I just returned from a stay in New Orleans where I spent 2 nights at the Le Richelieu.

It's an elegant old world style hotel (about 120 years old) and it's magnificient. The hotel staff from the front desk staff to bellman, housekeeping and security were outstanding. We visited NOLA for two reasons vacation and to support this lovely city in their rebuilding efforts. It's sad to see so many families displaced but yet they're so strong. Upon our arrival, we were checked into room 214 (standard king room but posh nontheless!), there was a leak from the floor above on the window sill. The moment the bellman realized the problem, they switched our room to room 227 (The Paul McCartney Suite!!!) It was magnificient. The room as huge and the balcony overlooked the front of the hotel. We had the full length of the balcony! The room had a kitchen with fridge and stove. The furnishings were exquisite although mid 80's style but elegant just the same. I developed a medical problem which of course had nothing to do with the hotel but they did everything they could to help me find a chiropractor ... nothing was open at 4:30pm on Saturday. So I had to go to the hospital. They gave my husband perfect directions and if you have to go to the hospital while in NOLA, go to the Touro Infirmary. Dr. R. Anand was wonderful and I was in and out in 1.5 hours. Now that's a record by anybody's standard. With the injury, we had to stay over another day. The hotel moved us to another room which believe it or not was better than the Paul McCartney suite. It was room 414 and let me tell ya ... you have room to spread out. The room has a kitchen (no microwave) but that didn't phase me at all ... living room, dining area with round table and four chairs, 3 closets (one closet was bigger than my home closet), old world style bathroom and the bed was heavenly!! We were so impressed with this hotel and when we come back next year, it will be our hotel of choice. It was a lovely stay and we hated to see the time end. All of the reviews on this site helped us make our decision and everybody was dead on!! If your worried about boutique hotel vs. chain, don't. This hotel will not disappoint you. They remember your name, which room you're in, when you ask for change for the street car or taxi, they remember to give you quarters ... it's $1.25 for the street car. The taxis have a set rate for travel so you don't have to worry about that. I can't say anything bad about this hotel ... it's a great hotel.

While this is a beautiful hotel in a great location, I would be very careful about keeping valuables under lock and key!", "Date": "March 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location and Staff, and a Perfect 25th!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1665013", "Content": "My wife and I booked the anniversary suite nearly a year in advance to celebrate our 25th anniversary, and we weren't disappointed. A bottle of champagne awaited us, and the room - with its pair of French doors overlooking the quiet end of the French quarter - made a welcoming and comfortable headquarters for touring. The front-desk staff were especially courteous and professional, even setting us up with their favorite waiter for an unforgettable night at Antoine's that included a personal guided tour of the entire premises. To top it all off, even during peak season the rates are competitive with a king room anywhere near the business district or Bourbon street. We can't wait to return to New Orleans, and will definitely book the Richelieu when we do.", "Date": "February 23, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cA very disappointing return to this hotel, never again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1616542", "Content": "In 2002, I and another couple had stayed here, and were quite pleased with the large rooms, the friendly staff, the free parking, and the nice location away from the wilder part of the Quarter. Therefore, without qualms I booked a two room suite for December 2003 for my honeymoon. What a mistake! Here are a few highlights: The tables were never cleaned in the rooms, and showed glass water marks throughout our stay; the bathmat was removed after use and not replaced; when room service was used, the waiter dropped a danish on the floor and then put it on the plate and gave it back to us (maybe he did us a favor, as the rest of the food was pretty much inedible); one of the two beds was very uncomfortable and lumpy; the water pressure in the shower was low; the elevator would close on you very quickly and not bounce away like most do if they catch you (and my poor husband with a cast was hit by those doors so many times!); the plastic flowers in the room looked like they hadn't been dusted since the place was built; and, wouldn't you think with us spending over a thousand dollars for a few nights, someone could have said \"Congratulations\" on the wedding? Instead we didn't even get a smile! And believe me, we aren't whiners and complainers, and this is the only negative review on a hotel I have ever written, but it is still bothering me over a month later, that we threw away more money than some top hotels were asking, to have such an unpleasant stay when things should have been so memorable (in a good way!). What was once retro and charming has become overpriced and threadbare.
