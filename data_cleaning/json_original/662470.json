I returned to Hong Kong over the holiday season and was booked into this hotel by my employer. I was there for a total of five nights, and the room was adequate. The bed was just long enough for my 5'10\" frame. It was uncomfortably hard though, and I prefer a hard bed. I thought the bathroom / shower were the highlight of the space. It was the only roomy part to the room. The shower had lots of hot water and was quite nice. It had a bench, although the shower head was not adjustable so it made it largely unusable. If I had to guess I'd say that the bathroom was recently renovated. The room was pretty clean. You could tell it was not a new room - the carpet was fairly worn and the furnishings showed their use. I was in the middle room of three on the floor, I found it noisy when the people beside were active, and in the hallway. Expected as much for a hotel in Hong Kong though. As per my last trip, I did not find the staff to be very friendly or outgoing, which I have found to be the norm at most Hong Kong hotels. All in all I was comfortable. On a side note. One of my colleagues was also booked in here. He is 6'3\", and got into a room where he did not fit the bed and could not adjust as there was a wall on the head side and a wall on the foot side. He also did not have a clean room, and checked himself out in the morning.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "KL", "Title": "\u201cBasic but perfectly adequate\u201d", "Author": "papercamera", "ReviewID": "UR122064878", "Content": "Room is small and basic but had the necessary amenities, is bright (had a large window) and clean.

Well again, if you have a PHD in electronics and way more patience than I have, you may be able to get it working only to be disappointed yet again by the extensive selection of tired old tunes and movies that await you at the end of your quest. The bed. Ah yes, the bed. Basically every bed in the hotel is a single bed or two single beds jammed together to make a double, which gives you a hard ridge right down the center.

The location is very good, a short walk from the shops and restaurants along Nathan Rd and about 5 minutes walk from Tsim Sha Tsui station.

The room was very small - we are travelling with two backpacks and with these on the floor, there was nowhere to stand so we basically had to get into the room and lie on the bed. The bathroom is small but adequate, however as a previous reviewer has mentioned, only share a room with a fellow traveller if you are very comfortable together (ie a partner) as the frosted glass between the bed and the shower leaves nothing to the imagination. On the plus side, the entertainment system was good after a long day shopping as there were plenty of movies on demand (and free) on the 42\" plasma TV. Airconditioning was controlled through the TV menu too - took a little while to work out how to use everything but once we got the hang of it, it was pretty good. There is a laundromat downstairs which was convenient and a number of cheap eateries around the corner. The flat panel speakers were a little unimpressive too, although I wonder whether I had them set at an incorrect angle or it was a poor DVD - a couple of the movies we tried to watch were unintelligible. The pool area was closed during our stay which was a shame.

Design of the hotel is chic - very cool yet elegant design of the facade! Rooms are well-maintained and come with FULL amenities a traveller would expect. Entertainment system is fantastic with so many movies and music titles to choose from. The free broadband internet access is a real bonus. Many hotels in Hong Kong are charging HK$100 per day but it's absolutely free here! Food choice is aplenty here. Four restaurants are housed in the hotel and there are many more restaurants just across the street along the famous Knutsford Terrace. The business centre is well-equipped with PCs, printer and fax machine. A swimming pool is also available for those who want to relax in after a day of work and/or shopping. Overall, this is an excellent choice for anyone visiting Hong Kong!", "Date": "August 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Solihull, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood location approached by short, steep road!\u201d", "Author": "brummiechinese", "ReviewID": "UR8051037", "Content": "I stayed at Mingle Place from 26 June for 7 nights. The hotel is situated in Observatory Court which is the road opposite the Stanford Hillview hotel which not all taxi drivers are aware of. This hotel is a boutique style hotel with rooms featuring LCD panel televisions, fingerprint recognition technology for the room doors (mine didn't work and was issued with a door card), air conditioning. Please be aware that the single rooms are very compact, particularly the bed which was just about long enough for me (I'm 5ft 8in)! Bed linen was clean but the blanket thin but heavy given the hot and humid climate. Bath linen changed daily. The bathroom was similarly compact with a walk in shower and very small sink. The room was made up every day although I noticed that the mirror panels in the room were never dusted down. Tea making facilities are provided and there is a small fridge under the token storage space area for hanging your clothes. The room boasts wireless networking, but the signal strength was consistently poor and non-existent and I gave up trying to connect at times although a network cable was provided (results equally poor). Staff were efficient and courteous but did not really go that \"extra mile\". The area is minutes from the well known Nathan, Carnarvon, Granville Road areas for shopping although Harbour City is also nearby and a favourite (and the local Fitness First gym!) and eating areas. You are also well served with bars and restaurants in the cosmopolitan Knutsford Steps area which is literally 2 mins from the hotel. Tsim Tsa Tsui MTR also close by. Unfortunately, I am unlikely to be returning to this hotel which promised much but failed to deliver overall.", "Date": "July 3, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Acesite Knutsford Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d662470-Reviews-Acesite_Knutsford_Hotel-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "$80 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No.8 Observatory Court, Tsim Sha Tsui</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "662470", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/d9/3a/5e/caption.jpg"}}
