La Rana Cansada is not your typical tourist trap; rather it is a welcoming establishment, with an air of staying with your laid-back relatives. Owners Thed & Pia go out of their way to ensure you have a pleasant stay. Upon arriving, my husband and I were a little distraught \u2013 our bus from the airport had been in an accident, leaving us to find our own route from the accident to the hotel. Thed immediately took care of us, brought us complimentary beers and upgraded our reservation to the suite with 2 balconies and a small kitchen. (The stove was a traditional Mexican stove \u2013 not something that we would have used because we didn\u2019t know how, but the fridge and microwave were nice to have!!) Throughout our week-long stay, Thed and his friend (also staying at the hotel) offered countless suggestions for places to eat, things to do, and a means of doing it all for cheaper! Thed even called his favorite restaurant, Tango Taco, to make sure they would stay open for us and ordered for us over the phone \u2013 we were exhausted and it was appreciated! Thed would check in at the end of the day as we\u2019d come back from our adventures to make sure that everything was up to standard. They also have a reading corner where travelers are welcome to borrow books \u2013 this definitely was appreciated by day 3 for me! Some things to note: - We did have 3 cockroach encounters (sadly, 2 were within our first 20 minutes when we were already a little fragile from travelling and our accident\u2026 not a fun way to start!). That said, you\u2019re in Mexico\u2026 what do you expect? - Other reviews mention the noise \u2013 they aren\u2019t kidding. We listened to terrible conflicting Mexican techno all night every. We were warned that the music would go late (until 2:00am) and were somewhat prepared for that. But in reality it never died. The music actually went all the way to 7:00am, had a 15 minute break, and then the morning mix started. By the end of the week, we were exhausted. We had briefly considered taking a \u201cif you can\u2019t beat them, join them\u201d approach, but couldn\u2019t because of the excursions we had booked and the early start times for those days. A simple solution: bring earplugs. - Past reviewers complained about the hardness of beds. I've stayed in Mexico 3 times in the past year and found that each time the beds were about the same. I don't think that's a fair complaint for La Rana Cansada! - The property is on a major strip, 10 Calle and between 5th & 10th, but is not right on the beach. There are lots of places on the beach where you can rent a lawn chair and park for the day. We found Alhambra to be the best price (about $8.50 for the two of us for the whole day) and we could order our drinks as we wanted them. The other places cost more ($15 a day) and we felt obligated to always have a drink on the go so it added up to a lot more! A few general recommendations for your trip to Playa del Carmen: - Eat at La Parrilla (on 5th heading towards Jaurez) and get the Tacos Arraqueso or Manuel\u2019s special. Or Tango Taco (on 10th Calle heading West towards Walmart) and get the Arracherra Steak or one of the Milaneses. These 2 restaurants were definitely our most favorite and among the cheapest! - Make sure to book excursions to Chichen Itza and Xel-Ha. They are incredible! Tulum was nice too, but way too crowded. If I could do it again, I would have just paid a cab to take me to Tulum early in the day and paid the entrance fee so I could avoid the massive crowds. All in all, I would do this trip again, but I think the earplugs would have drastically improved my experience! I would consider them a necessity for a return trip to La Rana Cansada.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, British Columbia", "Title": "\u201c\u00a1Me gusta La Rana!\u201d", "Author": "PlayaLili", "ReviewID": "UR104834825", "Content": "My husband and I have visited Playa del Carmen several times over the last ten years, and it\u2019s been fascinating to watch its transformation from quaint fishing town and backpackers\u2019 haven to vibrant travel destination attracting diverse international visitors.

I've stayed nowhere else since! La Rana is a quaint and charming hotel with Mexican style rooms and Mexican charm. A lovely garden area with tropical plants is central of the rooms,. There is a choice between air conditioning or not, and the rates are not expensive. It is very close to the beach(just a little over a block). The owners are amazing people who do their best to make each and every guest feel at home. The Bar Ranita is attached to the hotel, and is a hub of activity with many expats and locals alike, gathering in the evenings for drinks and conversation. I was at La Rana on their Anniversary, and I had expected a big party. There was an AMAZING party with free tacos which were amazing. The party went into the night and Everyone was so happy. This is Mexico, a land of enjoying and celebrating life. La Rana is a unique and awesome place, that is not for everyone, but those who \"get it\" return over and over and over again. Don't hesitate to give La Rana a try. I would also like to respond to the previous post... and I can show proof to anyone who wants it of how many times I have stayed at La Rana, and of my most recent week-long stay. The owners were host to several hundred guests the night of the Anniversary party, and could not possibly have been expected to give anyone undivided attention. I was there throughout the party and your accusations of \"assault\" border on slander. Please look at the bulk of reviews of La Rana...

Here are some material facts instead of those \u201cFriendly smiling people\u201d type, frequently used. About the property... 1.No architecture, it is a small yard surrounded by rooms, dark and hot with bad ventilation. 2.There is no division between the bar and rooms but the yard, you can hear the voices when you are sleeping as you were in the bar. About the rooms... 1.Dark with poor ventilation. The bathrooms have not a single window, they become into a sauna every time you need to close the door. 2.Small with bad distribution, there is no place to put a medium size bag on the floor. The hammock is in the middle of the room, making near to impossible to cross over the place. 3.The beds are as you can see in their pictures, hard as rocks. 4.The room with no A/C is as hot as a convection oven, there is no air circulation even keeping the door opened. One small window with no curtains near to the ceiling allows the Sun to come over your bed in the morning directly to your face. 5.The door of the next room was always opened blocking ours since when the door of one room is opened the other must be closed. Even pushing such door it always returned. 6.There was always a big black dog at the entrance of the room blocking the way to walk around. 7.There are not smokers / non smokers spaces, all the smog gets concentrated. 8.No security boxes, TV, phone nor Internet in rooms. About the maintenance... 1.No hot water in the shower. 2.The toilet does not work properly. About the management. 1.It was a problem to make the reservation with Jez (The manager) by e-mail, it must be done by phone. 2.I asked about how hot were the rooms and Jez said they were fine. 2.The check in was bad recorded, when the check out was made (18hrs, after I arrived) there was as if I stayed for one week. 3.When reserving, the rate includes taxes to be paid with credit card, but there you have to pay 12% extra of taxes for invoicing and 6% for credit card. There are a lot of hotels as cheap as La Rana Cansada with better facilities, location and friendly staff, frequently more professional. Please review some pictures in Internet before to make the same mistake than I, it does not matter what other people say, what you see in there is what you will get as my review describes.

The Rana is a simple hotel-- a courtyard surrounded by room on the ground level and some rooms upstairs. I stayed there this xmas and new years. The staff were all great. Jez, who manages the place for owners Pia and Ted was helpful, always around when you needed him and had great recommendations for food etc. The attached bar was an excellent place (recently enlarged) it is the home of an international gang of locals who run many of the best activities in the area so you can drink a beer whilst booking a dive or an ATV adventure. what you need to know-- there are no tvs, no phones in the rooms, no business centres and no internet access (though they may have wireless). Now if that is what you are looking for go to one of the big impersonal hotels. They do have AC (some reviewers may have been there before it was in), a lovely outside kitchen where you can cook if you want to, and hammocks inside the rooms and outside (you get beds too!), 24 hours someone is looking after things so if you get locked out (whoops, yes i did) someone wll let you in Ted and Pia have been there many years and are great to chat to. Their friend runs Babes across the road which is a great Thai restaurant and other friends run the best coffee bars etc in town. They threw a great party for xmas and another crazy one for new years and we were welcome at both. Trying to think of any gripes but i can't think of much. Compared to much of mexico, playa is pricey and Rana reflects this. You are not on the beach like many hotels but you are only a minute away. Oh-- yes, i have a gripe.
