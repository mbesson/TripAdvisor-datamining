The bathroom fixtures are old.The sink doesn't drain. There are curtains over windows that look out to less desirable views. One of the blinds on the door doesn't work. It could benefit from a full size fridge that isn't full of their costly mini bar items. The unit is in the back and has it's own access to the plunge pool. It's very lush and tranquil to come home to at the end of the day. Forget trying to sleep at night because of the party zone just down the street! The music starts around 10 pm and goes until the wee hours. I wondered if they put a more sound proof window in the bedroom area if that would help. My husband used ear plugs and slept fine. I can't use them and found the constant thump thump thump quite annoying. Last year we stayed at El Taj but I found a great deal on this unit at Villa Sacbe and thought we'd try it.

The owner, Evelyn, made the rental process easy and fun and made sure we were accommodated in every way possible, even supplying with a cell phone(charged up) for local calls and the free use of a landline so we could call home to Canada. Eveything we needed was in the unit: toiletries, blow dryer, coffee, pop in the fridge, water cooler, access to chairs, towels and umbrellas at a nearby beach. One thing that we didn't have was mosquito repellent and we could have used it. Although the main street, 5th Ave. is only one block away, once you enter the secure gate to the condo, it is peaceful and serene, not to mention beautiful. Unit 12 is on the 3rd uppermost floor and has a lovely wraparound balcony. In the mornings you can sit out and enjoy the beautiful colorful birds flying from tree to tree in the mini-jungle behind the complex, as you drink your cup of coffee. The management company that Evelyn uses greets you on your arrival and sees you off before you leave. The rep, Laura, explained everything to us, including how to secure an extra locked gate near our condo. One more floor up is a private rooftop jacuzzi. The condo itself is clean, beautifully decorated and charming. We were provided with maid service 3 times during one one week stay.

Property positions itself as \"luxury\", which is far from the truth, I would say that on scale of 1 to 5 stars, Villas Sacbe is 3 firm ... Mind this, it was built 17 years ago, the quality of craftsmanship, perhaps, at that time was 5 stars and luxury, when there was nothing to compare to, but in 2012, it is not luxury at all, I would say it is more of an average in line with lower class inns 2. The proximity to the beach is unbeatable, I have to state that for the record, the fact that you can use Indigo Beach for free is a great savings perk - however, since it is located on the high intersection point, forget about having a peaceful enjoyment ... Indigo Beach is located in the area where fishing boats are parked, and so you know, they use an older technique of anchoring the boat - ropes, anchors, cement blocks in the water ... To compare, walking 15 minutes either left or right would get you to a better beach, with better access to the water, no boats, no ropes in the water to watch for .. I think you get the picture .. 3. Use of gym facilities - not bad, equipment is clean, in working condition, four flat screen TVs, two would be running MTV music (same channel on both screens), however the reception was not the best and it is hard to work out when the music constantly goes in and out, so we opted to working out using our ipods ... 4. Cleanliness of the room - inn level, not luxury by any means ... Towels are overused and tired; ones day we decided to eat on the patio - and noticed that the cleaning crew has left their cleaning tools and chemicals, along with a plastic bag filled with clean and dirty towels right on our patio ... Well, I have stayed in some 5+ start hotels and never ones have I seen something like this ... 5. Indigo Cafe by the Beach - food is not bad, but not your greatest either ... I can understand that they are tailoring their menu to the satisfy largely American population, but french fries on the beach? You gotta be kidding me ... And fresh juices: only two potions - orange or grapefruit ... To compare, when I was staying in Dubai, even the cheapest road cafe had an impressive fresh juice stand with you-name-they've-got it combinations available ... Can't say, however, that Indigo Cafe is overpriced ... Compared to other places, it is not super expensive ... 6. Waiters - it would greatly vary on who get to serve you ... Some speak English and some don't ... but one day the electric power went out and the waiter serving us calculated our food using a piece of paper .. all of a sudden everything was 5-10 pesos more, we just happened to order exactly the same items we did the day before, but our check was 50 pesos more ... 7. Front desk - keep in mind that if you are staying in Villas Sacbe, you are still to required to check in at Porto Playa, which is a short walk down the street ... We checked in without any issues ... The checking out, however was a different story ... Since we don't speak Spanish, it can be frustrating talking to the companies that serve English speaking clients, but don't have staff who speaks English ... We cam to the \"reception\" asking for help when we were trying to call our transfer ride to the airport ... It is too bad, I did not get the name of the girl who was helping us ... She listened to what we were after, took the number, called the company and told us that \"They are closed, but there is a cell phone number to call, try that\" ... We said, we don't speak Spanish and needed her help, as the recoding on the answering machine was in Spanish ... She called the cell phone number, spoke briefly to someone and than hung up saying that she was told that the transfer operator did not have a record of our reservation ... So much for help there ... We were not able to get hold of our transfer operator that day, and decided to wake up early next morning and try calling them again - she told us, that their recording said their business hours was from 9am-5pm ... Our flight was at noon, so we though that if we call them at 9am, we would still be able to make it to the airport fine .. So we go to the reception to check out, she greets us with a smile and says \"Your taxi driver was here at 8am, he waited for your and left, because you were not around, but if you want to, we can arrange transportation for you and that would be $150\" ... To say that I was furious is to say nothing at all ... I had to restrain myself from using profanity, but all I really wanted to say, you stupid b**ch, we were here yesterday and you knew were not able to get hold of them, why in the world did you not call the room when the taxi was there at 8am? Yes, the transfer operator and the condo are not related, but hiring an idiot to run a reception, com'n now ... We called the transfer operator one more time at 9am, and were told that no taxi was coming for us, since we missed our driver at 8am - my question as to why they picked 8am for a pick up time, not 7am, not 7:30am was left unanswered ... And to add an insult to the injury we were told \"You are in Mexico and we don't have to speak English\" ... needless to say, Villas Sacbe or any other property under http://www.condohotelsplayadelcarmen.com/ won't be having us back in the future ... 8. Last but not least - one of the contributors mentioned that proximity to the night clubs ... To provide you with more accurate picture image a street lined up with six night clubs, with Mandala Playa topping the sound system ... The party goes on until 6am, and as much as I respect others right to party, it is impossible to sleep ... To sum it up ... we paid $290 per night ... got front desk that was less than helpful .. could not sleep until 6am ... not a hint of luxury if you ask me .... the only positive outcome of this trip was that we now know where we don't want to stay on our next trip to Playa del Carmen, 'cause we absolutely loved the place minus the boutique-condo experience .. Thank you for reading, hopefully it will help others to make an educated decision ...", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cAmazing vacation\u201d", "Author": "Ausra B", "ReviewID": "UR119418823", "Content": "\"\u201cVillas Sacbe is a luxury boutique hotel in Playa del Carmen, surrounded by tropical greenery and charming ponds.

The room was very clean and well maintained daily. Be aware that the sun will definitely find its way into your room as the rooms have this small colored window near the ceiling that does not have a cover, but who wants to be in bed when the gorgeous beach is right in front of you! The hotel does not it's own drink or food service, but the one next door did and was happy to accommodate those who wanted items. One can walk to others nearby, too. There was someone giving massages on the beach under a netted area which my husband thought was great (paid the equivalent of $40 US). There are people selling cloth & leather bracelets on the beach which are cute, but there isn't supposed to be any soliciting on the beach...Definitely check out the main drag of shops and restaurants, though walking a few streets back will get you better beer prices and opportunity for more \"local\" eateries. My husband speaks Spanish so we had an easier go of things, but most of the hotel staff do not speak English. Even the front desk person was a bit off, but this area is so much better than \"American\" Cancun that I didn't mind. This area is/was visited by more Europeans, but now its at least 50/50 if not more North Americans. I suggest taking the boat over to Cozumel which is easily accessible. Don't count on a big swimming pool experience. The pool is more like a fountain separating the hotel into halves. Definitely go back, though.

It's the perfect oasis after enjoying the multitude of amenities offered to every guest of condohotels. We spent our days at sunrise wandering the streets of 1st and 5th avenue then out to the beach to say good-morning with a yoga class on the beach in front of Indigo Beach club and then Breakfast at Indigo. A small rest and then off to The Gym, another amenity offered to every guest!, to work the bod for a little while; then it was off to the Indigo Beach club for the day to play in the water, the pier, the beach and enjoy the most luxurious beach club in Playa del Carmen where every need is catered to immediately. The menu has offerings for the decadent and the calorie conscious...I especially enjoyed their \"house specialty\" flat bread with veggies, chicken and goat cheese.

We are a middle class family from the KY with two teenagers (14 and 16) who typically stay at medium priced hotels like the Holiday Inn or Country Inn when on vacation. Since the kids had never been to Mexico and I had never been to the Yucatan, I was looking for something that felt like Mexico w/o exposing them to high risk situations. There were so many places to choose but we ended up picking this place based on reviews from this website. Actually, we thought that we were staying at the Maya Villa Condos but realized only later that we were staying at one of their other units (Villas Sacbe). The condo was located on 1st Avenue just 1 block from the beach and 1 block from the main tourist area of 5th Avenue. The main staff spoke excellent english and were very helpful during our stay. You first enter the condo via a locked gate where a very friendly security guard stood post about half of the time. Once inside, you find yourself in a make believe world resembling more jungle than condo. There appeared to be about 12 units covering 3 floors all surrounding this little piece of paradise. Each unit had a balcony facing the courtyard area with tables and chairs. Our unit (no 107) had two bedrooms separated by a nice-sized living and kitchen area. It was the perfect size for a family of 4 with nice furnishings and upscale baths. The pool was small but very enjoyable. It looked more like a stream running through the courtyard but felt really good on those hot days. I have read numerous conflicting comments regarding the noise at this and other hotels in the area. We stayed here 4 nights and experienced a different level of noise each night. In general, this is the biggest downfall to staying at any of the hotels near 5th avenue as the nightclubs are permitted to blast their music at ultra high volumes until about 4-5 am. That said, we left the AC fan running each night and could barely hear anything in our unit. As a result, it didn't keep any of us up. By day, the unit was so peaceful and secure feeling. It was nice to have unlimited filtered water in the kitchen and I am glad to say that none of us got sick while there. The daily maid service was fantastic as a family of 4 can sure mess up a place with towels, sand and dishes. The unit included access to the Indigo Beach Club. This is basically a reserved section on the beach with comfortable chairs, couches with fresh towel and drink service. The beach near the club is very nice but not the best place to swim due to numerous fishing boats tied there. The best swimming would only require a walk in either direction of a 100 yards or so. Overall, this place was a perfect oasis for my family.

The condo hotels have all the benefits of a hotel and condo rolled into one. The unit had a kitchen, free parking, a gym membership, FREE beach club access, free \"all you can drink\" bottled water, and a very helpful concierge. I cannot overstate how great the free beach club access is. You stroll down one block to the beach, and there it is. The Indigo beach club. Give them your towel cards (you get them on checking in), and pick out a chair, beach bed, or just take your towels and go where ever you want. If you decide to chill in the beach club they'll offer you drinks or food but you have no obligation to accept. You can sit there all day, not drink or eat, no charge! It's perfect if you prefer to explore other places for lunch. The condos are great, with usable kitchens. The maids are extremely meticulous and deserve tips. The concierge speaks perfect English, and is very knowledgeable about the area, how to use the bus, etc... The pool is small but nice for a quick dip if you need to cool off.

We have traveled extensively in the US and Europe, and our experience with these folks is among the best we\u2019ve had anywhere.

With her help, we enjoyed some wonderful meals, going off the beaten path and dining amongst the locals and other well-informed tourists. There was only one downside of our experience in the condo. It was very hot during our visit and the air conditioning unit struggled to keep the kitchen and living room area of the condo cool, although it did help with the humidity. While the bedroom and bathroom areas were very comfortable, we did not use the other rooms much on some of the hotter days. This was not much of a drawback, however, since we did not go to Playa to spend our time sitting in front of the TV.

Unit 9 is a one bedroom on the second floor and Unit 2 is a two bedroom on the first floor. The couple loved Unit 9 so much that they offered to trade rooms with us. Because we were traveling with small children, we agreed to the trade because Unit 2 is much more utilitarian in nature (although very nice) and because it would give us an additional bedroom for the kids instead of them sleeping on the huge sofa in Unit 9. I can see why Unit 9 would be better for a couple. It is well decorated and has a romantic ambience to it. Unit 2 was great, but is not nearly as well appointed as Unit 9. We enjoyed our stay tremendously and checked out at the same time as the other couple. The property manager inspected both rooms upon our leaving and found everything to be in order. When we returned home, the owner of Unit 9 promptly refunded our security deposit. I later learned from her that the owner of Unit 2 was refusing to refund the security deposit of the couple that we traded with. Not because of any problem with the condo or the rental terms, but merely because they had traded. Basically, he was banking on a technicality and refused to refund their deposit for that reason only. The owner of Unit 9 graciously returned the couple's deposit to them because she is an honest, responsible owner that understand the value of repeat business. The owner of Unit 2, however, appears not be as scrupulous. While Unit 2 was nice, I would not recommend that anyone who books it be very careful in dealing with this owner.", "Date": "September 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Location.\u201d", "Author": "GTHPTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR12916479", "Content": "My wife & I stayed here for 2 weeks in November 2006.

We were also able to purchase our tequila and wine there. It was nice be be able to make our own meals when we wanted to. The villas are centrally located to all the shops on 5th and easy access to the beaches. There is nightlife all around during the evening hours, but suprisingly the noise in minimal once you're inside your villa. We found the best beach to walk to was north on 1st ave, called Mamitas Beach Club. We hung out there a couple of days and rented a beach bed. It's a good beach location if you want to avoid the hotel tourists at Porto Real. Villa Sacbe is a great option if you like to be independent and live like the locals. You won't be surrounded by tourists or large families and your not sucked into an all inclusive deal where you have to eat gross hotel food.

The management didn't highly reccomend it, but we found the laundry service to be fine for a few pair of shorts and tee shirts. Done in 3 hours and cheap. The villa is centrally located to the beach and all the great restaurants. On the corner of 1 & 12 there's a great mexican pottery place if you're looking for something unique to take home.

Anyone planning a destination wedding or even a family reunion in Playa del Carmen should definitely consider the entire Villas Sacbe complex because it give a feeling of being in a little village all to yourself. The grounds are beautifully landscaped and condos are kept really clean (the daily maid service was awesome). Each condo is tastefully decorated using local handicrafts and materials, while being completely modern, cozy and stocked with everything you'll need to feel right at home. My guests kept thanking us for choosing such a beautiful place for everyone to stay. Since most of us were for for about a week, we went grocery shopping and took advantage of the fully-equipped kitchens. My unit #6, had a rooftop terrace with an outdoor bar and grill so one night, we barbequed up there. It was so much fun! One of my friend's units even had a rooftop plunge pool with an ocean view. Incredible! The location provides convenient access to 5th Ave. nice restaurants, bars, and shops. What's also great about their location is that even though it's in the city center, it's quiet and peaceful once you enter the property. It was nice for our guests to be able to walk around town and explore without having to hire taxis to get around. Another convenient amenity was the free underground parking because some of us had rental cars and street parking is hard to find. Planning a destination wedding from the States can be very challenging, but the extremely helpful staff, who all spoke English, were eager to help us with anything we needed. The property manager Donna and Absalon went above and beyond our expectations by helping us plan a welcome cocktail party in the pool area, complete with catering, decorations, bartenders and DJs. They even helped us book a tour company to take a big group of us to Tulum to check out the Mayan Ruins, beaches and a couple cenotes. Believe it or not, they even helped me order my wedding flowers directly from one of the best florists in town, saving me hundreds of dollars. Fernando and Egenio, who worked the front desks and were also eager to help with everything from directions, transportation arrangements and even translating for us when we needed it. They even helped book transportation for our wedding party to get to the church in a really nice air conditioned van.
