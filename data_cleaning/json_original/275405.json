It will provide you all you need - clean bed with nice sheets, simple furnishing and decent breakfast. I booked it just to be on safe side, to have some place reserved while I intended to continue searching for some nice yet affordable place on grachtengordel or Centraal area to show it to my friend who was travelling with me. Unfortunatelly and stupidly, I clicked on nonrefundable rate when booking via booking.com and though Booking was indeed very hard trying to convince the hotel to change for refundable rate, the hotel denied. It did not sound very guest-friendly to me so I was awaiting anything but nice stay since the reviews varied from satisfied to disgusted but in the end, it was not bad at all. It is outside of the center but it is well reachable by several tram and bus lines and in interesting, nice and safe surroundings of Rivierenbuurt (no De Pijp as the hotel claims on its website though). It is within good reach of Museumplein as well. The heating heated more than well and you could stop or switch it on as and wenever you wanted. Sheets were clean and towels were changed. The furnishing is modern, very simple and basic and due to the year of refurnishing slightly worn out but not too bad. There was a hairdryer in the bathroom and seemed to be pretty efficient even for long hair. There was also safe box but seemed not to be working. The shower might be weird for the rest of the Europe but fine for Dutch standards - it lacks the basin and the glass walls, you simple take the shower standing on the floor in between the concrete walls behind the courtain). Probably also thanks to this fact the bathroom has a bit wetty smell but nothing serious - some odorizer would cure this quickly). What I hated was the strong cigarette smell in the room although I in the order clearly insisted on non smoking but really non smoking room. Well, the room had the sign banning the smoking in the room AND it had the old tobacco odour as well. I more and more think that this is rather problem of us, guests. Many people request non smoking rooms then smoke in them and the hotels in busy locations simply do not have chance to get rid of the smell in between. There is also very poor isolations between the staircase and the rooms, you hear everybody climbing up and down the typical Dutch (narrow and steep) staircase, laughs and also even water dropping into the bathtub in the room above of the ours (we had 203) so bring your ear plug-ins along. The breakfast is included in room price and is served in the pleasant breakfast area with a range of products including bread, knackebrot, corn flakes, croissants, ham, cheese, salami, very good white yoghurt, hageslag, cocoa, coffee, tea and box juice for free, while it was also possible to ask for some additional treats such as scrambled eggs, toasts, basic fruits such as bananas and apples, fresh juice and espresso against payment. There is little supermarket just next door, and there are several other shops including another grocery, chemists, tobacco, flower shop and several restaurants by the tram stop on the square. I strongly recommend you to try out the Thai Indonesian place by the tram stop Viktorieplein. We went there, had degustation menu of maybe 25 courses and the meal as well as the stuff was lovely. The old guy was as nice, friendly and wise as the old shaman on Eat, Pray, Love.

We had a clean room, with ensuite bathroom and a balcony. This hotel, like many in Amsterdam, was in a tall building with a winding, narrow spiral staircase and no lift - this was fine for us but may not be for others. It is a little way out from central Amsterdam, but is situated on the number 4 tram route so it was very easy to get into the city centre. It also very close to the RAI station, and from here it does not take long to get to Schipol by train. The breakfast was included in the rates and it was fine: the usual cereal, fruit, cheese and cold meat, coffee, tea, juice etc. There were no coffee/tea making facilities in the room but we asked for a cup of tea in the afternoon and reception made it for us. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room rates were subject to change: originally we booked for 3 nights and paid 99 Euros per night for the room (incl breakfast), which is good value for Amsterdam. However, we wanted to stay an additional night and the price for the room went up to 190 Euros, which was a massive increase. This was because there was a conference at the nearby RAI centre. So it is hard to say whether this place is good value or not - as their rates can change.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel\u201d", "Author": "sara m", "ReviewID": "UR117530817", "Content": "We had a nightmare finding the hotel so if your flying to Schipol, go to the train station and catch the train to RAI Station (~3 euros each, platform 3?).

Positives: +Fabulous breakfast, a great range of cheeses and meats, breads, tea and coffee and juice. +Nice room for a short stay. +Modern looking and well decorated +Staff spoke very good English Negatives: -No lift and we were on the 4th floor! Taking 2 suitcases up 4 flights of very narrow and circular stairs is a nightmare! -Although the room was very modern and clean the only thing that was cleaned daily was the towels. Would have liked the sheets changed and the floors hoovered as they gathered a lot of dust and hair. -The room had no air con and was boiling but thankfully they had put a fan in, which was very useful. - not tea and coffee facilities in the room :( Although the hotel seems far away from town its a very short tram ride to the centre on tram no:4. Trams stop at 12:30 so if your going to stay out you can catch the 354 night bus from centraal or Leidseplein and get off at victoriaplein for the hotel. We got a 4day tram ticket on the first day from the tram centre at centraal and you can use them on both trams and night buses, which works out much cheaper. You can also catch the no:12 tram from Walstraat which will go to museumplein for van gogh and other museums.

The European Continental breakfast was Great and featured fresh fruit and lots of good stuff to start your day like breads, pastries, hard boiled eggs, cheese and cold cuts.

There is no lift and the stairs are steep and twisty. Be prepared for this! Despite its quirky and interesting design, you can see that the hotel is a little bit run down.

We spent ages online trying to find a decent enough hotel that would have on suite bathrooms, double beds and if possible a breakfast thrown in with the price. Loads of places had shared bathrooms for the price we wanted to spend, which wasn't very appealing for the friends who were going as couples. We found Hotel Victorie, and all though a lot of pondering took place over if was too far out or not from the city centre we decided to give it a go because it was just in our budget range and had loads of good extras. This it seems to be a great decision as the place was only 10-15 from the main centre via the tram, and it being in a quiet neighbourhood, it was nice and peaceful. I cherish sleep when i get it, so happy days when hell isn't breaking loose outside your hotel window. The staff were very helpful and did a great job hosting us during our stay. A great recommendation for an Indonesian restaurant called Kantjil btw, cheers for that! My single room was a little pokey but had a nice balcony to chill on made up for the fact. The double rooms were nicely decorated and all slept well within them. The only gripe was that the walls are a little thin so it's not great if there are noisy guests staying in the hotel with you. Breakfast was simple but a great continental style selection of various bits. Free internet was a great added bonus. We stocked up on alcohol at a cheap supermarket, which was virtually next door (bars in the city sell drinks for over 5 euros, pretty expensive). Overall i'd recommend this to anyone except epic socialites who want to be in the thick of it in the centre of the night life getting wasted, who don't care about the fancy extras.

Anyway, the hotel itself is located just outside of city center, not neccessarily a bad thing. There is a tram stop just at the corner so it is ver accesable, i believe Tram #4. More importantly when you are not completely with it after midnight the night bus is #355. The entrance to the hotel is a flight of steps that leads you to the lobby with a nice reception area. I guess the lobby person thought we were fit so she stuck us on the 4th floor. Typical amsterdam style, steep stairs that curve around. The room itself was pretty nice. The decor is very 70's with large cushions and weird looking furniture that has no purpose. The bed i have to say sucked. It was two twin beds pushed together, with wheels on a hardwood floor. Needless to say if you are with your significant other, over time there will be a big hole between two beds perfect to fall into. It was quite annoying. The bathroom was nice with a decent shower and good water pressure. The absolute best thing about the hotel is that it is quiet. In addition they provide a fan which is also nice.

First, when we got to Amsterdam quite early on Saturday, it took us almost 40 minutes to get to the suburb where the hotel is located and actually find the property. Walking to the hotel, we were shaken by the rows of century-old council houses, done up in bad taste, only to find out that our 4 star Design Hotel, was one of them. When we got there, we were told to come back later as check-in time was 2:00 PM and we couldn't stay in the area, because everything was so lacklustre, lugubrious, and felt unsafe. Then when we returned in the afternoon, we had to bring our bags up the 2 floors through a cramped and shappy staircase. The room, when we finally got to it, gave us shivers. The 1970s decor, the open shower, the cold and the noise from non-existant insulation. As a grand finale, the view from the (shared) balcony was ironically pittyful rather than pituresque. Simply traumatising landscapes! Finally, to top it all, we were literally thrown out of the room at 11AM by room service, after a tasteless breakfast, and the lady at the reception when we checked out (probably a senior manager) was despicable: a disgrace, in one word. In a nutshell, there is nothing to make up for any of the numerous drawbacks of this hotel. It's a sacrilege to recommend this hotel as a Design Hotel, in Amsterdam, close to everything.

We went to Amsterdam for a long weekend & decided to try something further from the centre, as whenever we did that (on our budget) it was always disappointing. We were pleasantly surprised by Hotel V. Although it was a tiny bit tricky to find at first after we stepped off the tram, a hint in our one recent guidebooks saying we wouldn't miss the purple front doors gave it away. The staff were very friendly & helpful. Although when we did ask with help to find somewhere to eat locally (meaning less than a 5 minute walk) the staff never seemed to know, each time he/she said they didn't know because they didn't live in the area... But we managed to find a great Mexican restaurant not too far away by ourselves for our 1st meal (we arrived late on a Friday night). I can't recall the street names anymore, but if you turn left out of the hotel & follow it to the main intersection/junction with the tram lines, turn LEFT (you'd be following that main road towards the city centre, not towards the congress/conference centre). Up a few blocks it's on the right-hand side of the street. Very tasty! Our room at Hotel V was fine. Our bed was great, large & comfy. But the shower/bathroom was a bit strange. The lighting was a bit too subdued & when in the shower one could hardly see. Also, there was a bit of mould growth on the walls in the shower. I think it was mainly because they had only painted the walls in the cubicle (no tiles). Or maybe perhaps they had forgotten to use the special kitchen/bathroom paint. But the amount of mould wasn't gross or anything, just a bit baffling. The soundproofness of the rooms could have been better. In a small hotel it's really important to have appropriate soundproofing both to other rooms & the street. It was not very good at Hotel V, so either travel with a group there so hopefully you'll know your neighbours or be aware it won't be quiet when others are awake or traipsing by your room.
