The title \"Sleeping in a Disco\" is right on. I arrived at midnight and all clubs were already in full swing. These clubs are right down the street and are one of the few ones opened till 4am. Immediately when I got here I was welcomed warm heartedly and told that noise would not be an issue they have double paned widows and then provided with ear plugs and instructed on how to use these. What brought me to the place was the location and also the style of the room, the Robinson Crusoe look. Well I got a different room a much bigger one but not want I had initially in mind. Another thing was the price, I was told that there is an extra 6% charge if I use my credit card. This was not indicated properly on the site, only if I pay cash will I not have this issue. The room was nice, staff very friendly, but if I had read TripAdvisor I would have picked up not only the noise issue each and every night of my 7 day stay but also the other complaints made about the sheets and mattress. In addition the bathroom sink had severe issues where the faucet was shorter then the basin making water leak all over the counter and difficult to place your hands under the faucet to get access to water. I am totally not happy with the place. When one goes on vacation you expect that what you pay for is clearly stated, any pictures that show the room your are booking is exactly or closely follow with what you choose up front and and that any extra charges or fees are clearly indicated. If this is not the case and they can not meet this then the hotel should let you know up front so you can make the right decisions up front and not have to deal with them on the spot during ones stay.

We had booked to stay for 15 nights but only stayed one as unfortunately we were placed on the ground floor which faced into the small court yard and everyone entering stared in our room, so we needed to leave the drapes closed, this left the room dark. No other rooms were available due to the Easter weekend. Since we are a middle aged couple who were looking for tranquility this was not the place for us as the discos can be heard till the wee hours of the night.

We looked at the website, and it looked and sounded like a great place to stay with the Mexican charm we were looking for. My lesson was this: Do not judge a hotel by the website. The website says this: \"The Eclipse Hotel is located in Playa del Carmen's most privileged location, in the very heart of town, on First Avenue, between the beach and Fifth Avenue (close to the action, yet secluded enough to guarantee you a good night's sleep).\" Unless you like to go to sleep after 4 or 5 AM, you are not getting a good nights sleep. There are 4 very happening bars located literally 50 steps from the hotel that play loud music from about 10 pm until 4 am. And the mattresses are very hard and uncomfortable. Also, we found the website to be very misleading....there is NO snorkel equipment for guests to use...there is no Deli Shop to eat at....24 hour security service?? Not so much....we arrived to a dark hotel that even though we gave them our credit card information and had a confirmation for our 10 NIGHT stay, there was no one around to contact...there is a phone #...but we did not bring out cell phones as we are from Canada going to Mexico for a vacation....not a business trip. After the friendly girl in the shop next door tried to help us out and after almost an hour....We ended up having to stay in a dingy little hotel room with no hot water...across the street for the night. (not the most enjoyable thing after a FULL day of flying with 2 kids and 4 suitcases to lug around) There is no place to get a massage........the terrace that is pictured on the website photos looks NOTHING like the photos. It is unused and un kept. I even got to sneak a peak at the rooftop jacuzzi tub that looks like it hasn't been used in about 12 months. The safe in the rooms are there, yes, but at a charge of $2.00 USD per day. The barbecue area....um....well we didn't cook any food on it....lets just leave it at that. Not sure what kind of room service they offer, seeing as there is no place to eat other than the continental breakfast they offer ar $5.00 USD per person per day, which we did find sufficient. Fruit, toast, cereal, coffee, tea, juice, and some pastries. It was good. And the lady that serves it every morning, not too sure of her name....well, she was sweet. There is no Bar and Restaurant. So dont believe that either. As for the beach club facility access...not sure where that is...nor was it mentioned to us upon arrival or at anytime during our stay. There is internet, but it does have a cost of a minimum of 10 pesos. Even for hotel guests. So, from our point of view, we do NOT recommend this hotel. It has a lot of false advertising on it;s website, and pamphlets, and unless you are going to be out partying all night long every night....this is not the place for you. Which is unfortunate, as it is close to the beach (but there are lots of others) and the room itself was nice.

Having a choice of places to sit apart from the bed was very nice for my extended stay. I was able to settle into my room and did not have to change rooms at all during my stay. The hotel courtyard is beautiful and I enjoyed sitting on the roof deck in the evenings. The hammocks under the large palapa on the second floor were the perfect spot to relax on the few rainy afternoons. The hotel provides free drinking water and coffee available day & night and the breakfast at the Hole in the Wall next door was amazing. I made use of the beach club passes hassle free. The bed was comfortable, the shower hot with a new hot water tank having been installed at the beginning of my stay and the wireless internet was an added bonus. Mexico is Mexico and there are always little hiccups that could be perceived as inconveniences but I choose to look at those things as all part of the adventure. Sometimes the lights went out, sometimes the water was turned off, sometimes the internet was down, these experiences were few and far between, never lasted long and were always taken care of immediately with care and concern from the staff. These things even happen in my own home from time to time so I would never consider these to be a poor reflection of the service of this hotel.

Matias checked me in and set the stage for what I found to be exceptional service from himself, from Pedro the receptionist and also from Peter the owner.

When I wanted to arrange a taxi to take me to Tulum for the day, they took care of it. When I needed my laundry picked up, they took care of it. When my friend arrived for a week they put him in the next room with an adjoining door between us. They directed me to the nearest gym that didn't charge and arm and a leg, when I wanted restaurant recomendations they had plenty, when I wanted food delivered they took care of it.

The beach is just a short walk from the hotel. I recommend turning left once you hit the beach and walk past the large pier because there are better waves there. Free breakfast at The Hole in the Wall was amazing! They served freshly squeezed orange juice and your choice of 5 different entrees. I recommend the potato and egg burrito with fresh salsa. Since the hotel is located centrally near 5th ave, one can walk from one end to the other of 5th and take a look at all the great restaurants. I am not too sure why the owner of the place would want someone like Martinez running his hotel because on more than one occasion I witnessed him being rude to guests or telling them that he didn't have time to deal with their simple requests. We asked him for some cups the one day and beach towels the other, and the response was always the same...\"what do you need that for\".

I can only thank God it was for one night. I had been in contact with Matias the manager, for at least 4 months when I had booked it through their website. I really just wanted to make sure we would be getting what we needed and what he said we would get, which was the Robin Cursoe suite. We had 4 people, which were 4 adults, me and my husband plus our daughter and her friend (so 3 girls and one guy). We needed at least 2 big beds. We were told, plus the pictures on the website, that this suite had a pull out sofa bed downstairs and a king and little hammock upstairs. I thought this was good as the girls could sleep downstairs and we would have the king bed. Well when we got there, no bed downstairs so now there is only 2 beds for 4 adults, not acceptable (one single bed and one king bed upstairs. The air conditioning did not work. this place looked like a dark dungeon inside. You had to leave the door open to see anything on the bottom floor. It looked like it had not been cleaned or used for quite some time. After a little arguing on the beds, they finally brought in another single bed and stuck it in the corner on lower floor. It took quite a while for the 3 workers to get the air working but it was short lived and made a lot of noise. Matias said the air had been working all week and didn't understand why it wasn't working. We found out the next day the other AC's in other rooms hadn't been working either. I ended sleeping downstairs because the girls refused to sleep down there. The musty smell kept me awake most of the night. It was horrible. I was never so glad to leave this hotel. I thought Matias was arrogant and yes, rude at times also. I never felt he was being honest or caring, just wanted the buck. The location is good and the hole in the wall breakfast nook next door had good food. We had room 11 so it was upstairs. The sitting area and balcony area up there was very nice. I haven't seen the upgraded rooms but I think if they put some extra time into these other rooms, it could be a nice little hotel. It's just not right now.

I should have argued this with him but I was too tired from traveling and just wanted to go to the beach. The room smelled very musty and the AC didn't work the first two nights. Matias, the manager went out of his way to get it fixed. It was on a Sunday and the repair man wasn't around. Once it was fixed the smell went away. We were in room #1. The bathroom was somewhat updated with a new toilet and sink/faucet, but the shower could use a new shower head, as it flooded the whole bathroom every time we used it. I can see they're working on upgrading the rooms, and some of them are complete and very nice. We loved the location.

For the price, it's worth it, but I'd be willing to pay a little more to have an upgraded room with newer ammenities, which is what we'll do next year.", "Date": "March 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "jodyroberts", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "jodyroberts", "ReviewID": "UR10717440", "Content": "This was my second stay here with the same type room (kind of like a two level small bungalow).

Upon arrival, we paid upfront in cash for the Robinson Crusoe suite. For 2 people, the size of the Robinson Cruisoe suite was good however it was dark in the room for the windows upstairs was small plus the bed was super lumpy. I spoke with the staff and was immediately upgraded to the apt (well not really an upgrade since it was the same price) but it was much more spacious and bright. It also included a balcony facing the street which was nice. Pros: ~ Incredibly helpful staff ~ A block away from the amazing beach ~ A block away from 5th ave where all the good shopping and restaurants were ~ Not much noise from parties down the block at night ~ The AC was powerful, a great relief from the heat Cons: ~ Our beds were dirty... I inspected it before sleeping on it and found that the sheets were not changed since I found a couple of long black hairs on the bed and pillows from previous occupants. Gross! There were brown stains on the sheets as well (but we didn't complain to the housekeeping). ~ The blanket on the extra twin size bed was dirty. We didn't touch it so I don't know what was the stuff on the blanket. ~ Some towels also had mysterious brown stains on it ~ The bed was rock hard I did enjoy dealing with the office staff for they were really friendly and had a sense of humor. Just need better housekeeping!! I would most likely fork over more money for better accomodations next time. Helpful tips: Ask about parking regulations!! I didn't know we couldn't park 15meters on a yellow from a corner ( where some yellows you can). The police will give you a ticket AND take your front license plates away. I had to pay Hertz US$133 to recover the license plates and cover the ticket because I didn't have time to do it myself. If you need to check out really early in the morning, make sure you let the office staff know for we had to leave at 7am to catch a flight but didn't realize the office wasn't open until later. We left the key in the room hoping that was okay. Bring shampoo, etc. The only toiletries they provided were bar soaps.", "Date": "September 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat place\u201d", "Author": "ebobbitt", "ReviewID": "UR7955346", "Content": "June l, 2007.

They have a wonderful courtyard with birds and nice landscaping. And the location is absolutely ideal. one block to the beach, one block to the excitement of 5th avenue. The bed was comfortable, maid service was also good. Overall I would recommend this hotel to those who are looking for a quiet place to call home whil exploring playa, (trust me, you wont spend much time in your room anyways).

I was not thrilled with the room but thinking it was cheap and the location was good I left my bags in the room and headed to the beach. (i wasn't thrilled with the room because it was very dark, rock hard bed and a kind of rustic decor that really needed an update!) After I returned from the beach the door to my room was wide open! No one was in the room when I entered but soon after a workman came saying he had been working inside and forgot to close the door! OK, not good, but being hot and sandy I was ready to shower and as I stepped in the shower I was shocked to see only a hole in the wall-no showerhead! Now I'm really annoyed, put my sandy wet clothes back on and go to complain. I was told 'theres a problem with the plumbing in that room but you can use the public shower outside\" At this point I was in no way going to stay in this dungeon and I requested a refund from Peter/owner. After a heated conversation where he first wanted to refund nothing & then said he could refund 50% of what I paid for the room per policy I realized he was LYING to me as my confirmation stated the refund policy was if room cancelled 3 nights penalty would be charged. At that point when I told him I had it in writing I was refunded my $$ minus 3 nites charge.
