{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Do Not Stay Here There is now way this hotel is 4 stars. I would maybe give it 1 star. There were stains outside of the elevator. When I went into my room there was an awful smell. There was mold in the bathroom. I laid down on my Single bed and could feel the springs in my back. I highly recommend the Marriott in Hoopdorf instead of this place.", "Date": "Dec 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR386724310", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "brettrieck"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d1204597-r22356261-Hotel_Restaurant_de_Beurs_Hoofddorp_located_nearby-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "HotelID": "1204597", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
