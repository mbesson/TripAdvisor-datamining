The main floor lounge is great for people watching though the hotel is tucked away just south of bustling King West so you won't see the action on the streets but lots of movers and shakers come here for cocktails.

The Diner restaurant serves a great omelette for breakfast. The rooms are a good size and the rain style shower head is nice in the bathroom. Main quibble is the bed linens. My bed had no top sheet, only a thick duvet. Great if you are a chilly sleeper. I had them remade with a top sheet and blanket. The Wabora Japanese restaurant next to the hotel is okay but nothing special though the various Maki rolls are quite innovative (however lots of deep fried ingredients and cream cheese.)

There is parking in the neighborhood - right across the street the lot was $10 during the week and $15 on the weekend, so no need to pay for their $35 parking (unless you don't trust leaving your car out overnight, but the neighborhood felt safe). If there are events in the area I was told the prices of these lots might change though. Our room was by the elevator so it was a bit noisy, but the bed was SOOO comfortable and I slept great. Gym is pretty awesome, lots of equipment, there's also a yoga studio there (but it's almost $20 a class...) Rooftop bar is pretty swanky, if you are bringing friends though they recommend you make a reservation and get bottle service so you have somewhere to sit... views were great but we all ended up just going down to one of the pubs on the corner where beers are $5 and things felt a bit more real.

It sounded like a good 6 people (all drunk) were packed into one room all trying to talk over one another. Several minutes later, it became obvious where the smoke smell had come from, as kids next door were clearly smoking pot and the fumes were wafting from under the door.

It seems the food quality has gone down, while the prices have gone up: Orange juice + pancakes for two rendered a near $60 bill - the orange juice was from concentrate while the pancakes were dry & tasteless, had NO sides (for $17 you would expect some bacon) & didn't even have a handful of fruit in them (banana pancakes were more like a hunt for banana in a whopping pile of cheap flour) Again, I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this hotel, considering the high caliber of service the American locations provide.

But not with 19 and 21 year old punks but with a very mature and very good looking crowd. They require you to get a stamp before you go to the rooftop but we just had our key in hand and it was no problem(by the way, they have very good looking hostess to stamp you!).

You step outside and look to your right to see a row of messy unkept balconies - must have been owner occupied suites in need of extra storage. Unsightly. The TV unit was broken with a cabinet almost off its hinges. The furniture was worn, carpets and countertops stained. All in all it was a huge disappointment. And staying in the Thompson Suite didn't even give you the privilege to sit in the reserved bottle service only areas. The corridors looked cheap and were too bright.

Was initially impressed by the decor - how wrong was I. This hotel is apparently the 'party place' in Toronto - it has a nightclub on the top level and is full of underage people who the hotel have apparently allowed to check into the rooms. I witnessed and extremely peeved person who also conveyed the same information to the front of office staff who seemingly could not care less. All night there were EXTREMELY intoxicated people on the level that I was staying (Level 3) and at one stage there were 3 girls who were so pissed that they collapsed on the floor as they could not get into their room which was next to me (check the cameras Thompson and you will see what I mean). There are cameras on each level so the security staff are either not working or could not care less. The fire alarm went off at around 1.45am and then again through to about 2.30am twice. The extremely courteous staff at the Thompson must have thought that alerting the guests to what was happening was a privilege. We received a voice message after the fire department had arrived (some 15 minutes or so after the fire alarm) to tell us that it was a false alarm. The pannicked people at the hotel will attest to the experience and the fact that the staff working need to seriously do some courses on the fire system and what needs to be done to not panic people. Given the fire alarm went off 2 more times through to about 3 in the morning I certainly felt that when I was charged for the night I got my value for money - certainly not !. I will be personally reporting my experience to the fire department in Toronto just so they know what a liability the staff are in keeping the guest assured that all is OK and that the fire alarms are actually false alarms. I travel a lot and have visited Toronto on numerous occasions - my advice is simply pick another hotel.

The bar at The Thompson is my BIGGEST pet peeve. The roof-top bar is well-guarded and continues to have absurd rules about how many guests hotel patrons may bring. The lobby bar has become a loud and crowded pick-up joint.

I especially liked the heated bathroom floors, the great shower and sink, and the comfty bed and pillows. There is a comfortable chair in the room, a counter for incidentals, a mini bar and a flat screen tv just to name a few things that add to the overall ambience. The only complaint we had was the reception upon entering the hotel was very cold and impersonal to say the least. It was our first time at the hotel and although we only stayed one night, we do stay in hotels in Toronto several times every year. The front desk clerk was talking to a friend when we got there and the friend stepped aside when she was checking us in. It was all she could do to give us our key...no 'welcome to the hotel' or any other type of greeting, I would be hard pressed to even say that she said hello to us. I am not looking for much here ...just a word or two would have made a huge difference. The next morning when we checked out it was a different person and she was interested in how our stay was and she was very pleasant.

The good- Location. Walking distance to many restaurants, shops, clubs and services, and all in an exciting urban neighbourhood that gives off a very strong vibe as a cool, creative and up-and-coming area of the city. If you are staying outside of the downtown core this hotel is without question one of your better bets *if* you're looking for the kind of vibe this neighbourhood has to offer. If you couldn't care less then you'd probably find better value for you buck elsewhere. On-site amenities. We enjoyed dining at the Counter which is open 24 hours which is perfect for a late-night bite after clubbing etc... and lets face it, if you're staying at the Thompson you're probably enjoying a little late-night clubbing, or probably should be. And even though there are lots of bars and restaurants nearby you could be excused for not ever leaving the hotel given the other restaurant and bars choices on hand. Although we didn't try the restaurant we did enjoy early-evening cocktails in the roof-top lounge before heading out for the evening. The view here is spectacular and well worth going out of your way for, and even in February when the famed swimming pool is closed. It was fairly calm and quiet at the time we were there but the bar tender tells us it gets quite busy as the evening progresses. We did note, however, that the lobby bar was buzzing. Rooms. The King room we had was spacious, nicely designed and cool, and we didn't experience the noise that others complained about... but then again I always travel with ear plugs 'just in case', especially when staying in a city where traffic, car alarms, and late-night revellers can ruin a night's sleep in even the best of situations. Also, lets face it, if you're looking for peace and quiet the Thompson would probably dissappoint. There is definitely a party atmosphere going on here which is presumably why you would want to be here in the first place. The 'less than good'- The 'Essentials'. I didn't particularly find the bed/pillows very comfortable. The mattress was a little soft and schlumpy for my liking. Also, the occassional chairs in the room were cool, but not very conducive to lounging. The 'Goods'. The staff were very stingey with the bath products and towels, and though the products were very nice they seemed to be 'odds and ends' rather than belonging to the same line. I happen to believe that products should be restocked per person per night. This was not the case... and only two towels for two people? Come on, this is a boutique hotel! The 'Details': There is no bank machine in the hotel. The nearest one was a five minute walk away, which in February during a snow storm is a challenge for those well-coiffed 'hipsters' among us who didn't plan ahead. There is nothing to clean your shoes with! Again, we're talking hipsters and Slushy February weather!! Besides, this is a boutique hotel and should be all about the details. Even 2 star hotels I've stayed in have supplied a shoe-buff pack. ... so all in all does the 'less than good' outweigh the good? I'd probably say 'no', depending on what it is you're looking for: if you are looking for 'white glove' luxury/service or rest & relaxation it is fairly safe to say that this establishment is far more focused on the restau-bar component of their business than it is the hotel component and you will probably be happier elsewhere.

They need better doors that actually close out the noise. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The faux hardwood floors in the rooms look great, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reason why most hotels have carpet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c noise attenuation. I heard everything in the room above me, including high heels and the bed. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Total party atmosphere. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind it so much on Saturday night, but I was woken up at 3AM on Wednesday night to a loud party in a room down the hall. The party was apparently so loud that one of the girls took the cordless phone out into the hall to place her room service order. I had to call to the front desk to have the party broken up, and even then, there was still a lot of noise from down the hall. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 I returned Wednesday night at about 10PM \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been back to the room since I left at 8:30AM. To my shock, my door was ajar! It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t closed. Nothing was missing from the room, but this seriously wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cool. I called the GM, who apologized. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 I had a German beer mug in the room that I got from a conference event early in the week. It obviously wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a hotel glass, as it had the conference name on it. I know it was in the room, as I remember using it as a water glass one night. When I checked out Thursday morning, I realized it was missing. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the maid picked it up, and its in the kitchen somewhere. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Wireless internet is REALLY weak. I had to get a CATV cable from the front desk to plug my computer into the jack at the desk, which meant I had to do all my work from the desk. Not a big problem, but the desk is built into a wall of cabinetry, and I banged my head twice on the overhead cabinets. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 I really wanted to like the coffee shop, but nothing was really that good. The coffee was downright horrible. I like the taste of strong coffee and usually drink it black, but this stuff was horrible. There isn't enough cream or sugar that could mask the fowl taste of this crap. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The beds are just so-so. I think they are memory foam. They feel spongy--not exactly firm.

Five minutes later, we still didn't have menus.

I continued to watch, and she continued to pour , complain, and scalp the foam off the top of the glass.

The room is very modern and nearly useless. There's no coffee machine. If you want ice -- you have to call room service - there are no ice machines. The one time I did, it took an hour to come up.

I think the decision to stay here really depends on your age and the kind of hotel stay you prefer (we like hotels that focus on being a hotel, more than a hot spot). If you're a young couple wanting to be in a \"nightclub style environment\" with your hotel in the center of it and you have a decent budget than this is the place for you (the rooms weren't too expensive, but the incrementals can add up fast)! First impression (during the day) is that it's quite slick, nicely decorated and the service was good, quick & friendly. At night the doorman (a different guy from earlier) seemed more like a bouncer and was texting and swearing when we pulled up, which made us feel like we were staying at a nightclub more than a hotel. (It seemed like they did casting calls for most of their staff instead of \"hiring\"- however some of the front desk & day staff were the exception). They seemed to put a lot of effort into the style of the decor and less on the functionality. I wish they would have tested some of their \"design touches\" first before choosing style over usefulness. Stylish but impractical things include: the bathroom sink - huge and splashy, the lighting system - didn't work properly and turning on the bathroom light illuminates the whole room (argh!), no shower door - looks good, but is drafty, rain shower head - again, looks good, but is useless for women who don't want to wet their hair every time (I eventually asked for a shower cap, as one was not provided), and the black out blinds & curtains- light came in from above and in between. Also, there was a general lack of space to put stuff (especially in the bathroom due to the huge sink), plus our front door didn't close properly and needed to be pulled tightly shut. Pros included the stylish decor (minus the impractical things), bed was comfy, hypo allergenic bedding was available and still comfortable, Wobara sushi restaurant was delicious (even though it was just opened and they didn't even have their liquor license yet!) and the location. King West is an amazing location and as a former Toronto resident I have to say that the shops and restaurants around the Thompson are excellent! Pet peeves were: They only provided 2 towels and 1 bathrobe in a room for 2 with a King Bed, no slippers, only 4 hangers and no bathroom \"extras\" like Qtips, shower caps, sewing kit, etc. However I will mention that when I called down to request most of the above, they brought it to us fairly promptly (although I still feel like they should have been there automatically). Also, we had a corner room and half of our windows were covered in white vinyl, so the view was lost - which really was a shame. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the rooftop patio which is cool, with a gorgeous pool and has a great views of the city. But be warned the drinks are really expensive (a round of 4 vodka tonics was $53 - BEFORE TIP) and again the \"bouncer-like attitude\" is quite prevalent. Last mentions - the breakfast in The Counter (diner style), was OK - a little bland and nothing great (better options on King), parking was $35/night (which is crazy - for that price I felt like they should have included a car wash, at least), and the blinds really should be electric - the incremental cost/room should have been justified and they could do without the difficult to maneuver curtains and pulley blinds. Overall, now that you're read my review (thank you for doing so) - I suppose I'd recommend this hotel if you can get a deal and if you don't sweat the small stuff. The location is fantastic and if you can avoid the bouncer-like attitudes, pricey drinks and parking, you can have quite a pleasant stay.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLike in a prision!\u201d", "Author": "ernest155019", "ReviewID": "UR79453804", "Content": "I want to have a drink at the bar upstairs and the 'roof top' manager says I can't go and have to go back to my room.

The hotel is super new and clean. The staff was very helpful and went above my experience with other hotels. On my first night, one of the hotel clerks, Stephanie, sent room service with chocolate covered cherries with shaved white chocolate plus hot tea and to top that off a very nice note saying that she hoped I recovered from my travel day. (it was a very long day!). How sweet was that? I immediately felt better and the cherries were amazing. The only problem I had was resolved very quickly. My room was right next to an elevator so when I was trying to sleep I kept being awaken by people getting on and off the elevator. (everyone sounded really happy but really loud) Around 2am I was upgraded to another room and slept great. The Kings suite has a large bathroom, with tub and shower, plus a small living room and bedroom. The beds are really comfy. I only tried one restaurant in the hotel but it was perfect, The Counter, great comfort food and if you pick right, it seems healthy. Room Service was very fast too. Also, there is great shopping near by on Queen St. It reminded me a little bit of Haight Ashbury. There is also a great hot yoga studio half a block away.

We have a description of the whole experience with photos at our blog: http://bobofeed.blogspot.com/2010/07/fab-week-ends-of-summer2-staycation.html We found the staff 100% friendly & courteous- never a hint of condescension. The premises are quite stunning. We were very lucky to be upgraded to a suite & it was beautiful; it felt like an actual apartment. Two points worth noting, however: in the bathroom, the shower (large & comfortable) had a full width, full height glass window looking right into the bedroom. For any couples where there are modesty issues, this could be a problem. The biggest concern for us was that when using the facilities at night the light flooded the bedroom. Second point: the kitchen, which was full of modern cabinets, a full size refrigerator, and had a nearby dining table, came equipped with 2 wine glasses & a corkscrew and 2 drinking glasses. That was it. Not a spoon, not a little plate. We though this was a big negative strike. Sure, they want you to use room service, but it's a suite for goodness' sake. It just seemed stingy. Aside from these things we found the quality of the room to be exceptional. The main dining room wasn't open yet when we were there but we ate in the coffee shop, which was quite good. The rooftop lounge & pool are the hotel's big drawing card, at least in this first summer season. The area is cool & sexy, but suffers from its popularity. During the hot weekend afternoons the pool deck was very crowded & we're led to believe that this is in part because condo owners in the building have access. We managed to snag a couple of chairs & a table & had a nice afternoon but it was a twenty-something party atmosphere, which may put some off. We returned both evenings and had a blast. Great music, good drinks, again very friendly service despite the cool factor, very attractive crowd and a stunning skyline view! Our only reason for grading the cleanliness a little low was that there were still a few construction deficiencies. We had baggies over our smoke alarms to keep the drywall dust out, there were a few paint daubs where they shouldn't be and a carpet tile outside our door had a big stain on it. Housekeeping cleanliness was first rate, though. In fact we had twice daily maid service. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay at the Thompson and would recommend it to others. We look forward to trying the now-open Scarpetta, the hotel's main dining room, at some point soon.

Both days we had no problem finding lounge chairs. We asked for a late check out and were granted that as well. We called for additional towels and in less than five minutes they arrived at our room. The only down side to the roof top was we were informed it was closed at 5pm for a private party. They did however let us know this as soon as we checked in and we were not rushed out when we ordered drinks at 4:30.

Right now all it can offer and boast for itself is a pretty hotel and pretty staff. That's about it. What it's lacking is friendly, reliable, knowledgeable, experienced staff and manager, who understand the meaning, and how to go about executing, excellent and satisfactory customer service. Perhaps the hotel management thinks it's enough to cash in on the youthfulness of the very young staff, without proper experience and training under their belt. And the pretentious receptionists and guest services staff, who think they can get by on their looks, and don't need to smile, be friendly and engaging, just end up coming across as immature high school students who think they're too cool for school. It wasn't hard to see why and how this dysfunction came to be when we engaged with the manager and realized she was an elitist, incompetent and grumpy sourpuss (I'm trying to keep it polite). Apparently, the day we were there, she rented access to certain areas of the hotel (including the front lobby), to a film crew, to film a pilot of \"Alphas,\" for the day. The problem was, she didn't even bother to inform her staff, condo tenants, or hotel guests of any of this. The staff were not briefed as to this temporary disruption, or were they prepared on how to handle it, or how to address the guests in order to alleviate any undue stress on their part. The manager didn't notify the guests, prepare an alternate entrance, an alternate registration depot, or alternate exit, in order to maintain a smooth and professional operation, while still accommodating the film crew who payed big bucks and had a contract and a permit allowing them access to the hotel and immediate street area. Instead, it seems, the manager presented nothing but a bad attitude and an unprofessional demeanor, as she continually tried to kick the actors off the sofas, out of the lobby, and on to the street, as they were trying to work. It seems the production's location rental money was good enough for her to pocket , but the actors and crew were not good enough for the sofas and lobby of this stuck-up manager and hotel. The staff commented to us on their surprise when they came to work that day, only to discover a film being made, and nobody bothered to tell them. They also commented that the manager thought it would be a small, unassuming, in-and-out film shoot. First of all, there is no such thing as a small, unassuming, in-and-out film shoot - they're always huge and long productions, of at least fourteen hour days. No harm in not knowing that, but if you rent out a new and busy condo and hotel to a film crew, I'd think you'd do your homework, ask some questions and be prepared - at least a little bit. But to do nothing at all, and to not tell your staff, or your patrons, and then to deflect the blame on to the crew and performers (who payed you good money for the right to be there), when you are the only one to blame, well, that puts everything else that is wrong with this hotel in to perspective for me. For the staff to be mature, responsible, professional and friendly, then their chief commander has to possess all of those qualities first. It is a trickle-down affect, after all, whenever there is poor management, there will always be poor staff quality and customer service.

No noise issues (which was a concern, staying at an alleged party hotel.) Of course there are a few glitches because the hotel is still new. The elevators require a room key to move from floor to floor so we ended up going on a few elevator rides up and down if we weren't fast enough with our room key card. Security presence in the hotel's lobby seemed excessive, like they were running a night club or something. We weren't bothered because we had our hotel keys to show we were guests.

I had a great corner room with a good view of the CN Tower and park below.

Now the best thing by far about this hotel, the crown and jewel was the amazing pool deck. Incredible views, lounging areas and off the course, the pool. Loved it, the crowd was somewhat pretentious but the bar staff where friendly and cheery. Did I mention the views where stunning! This is why I really wanted to stay at this hotel. Lastly, the all-day resto I dined at for breakfast was fun and again cool, but nothing special. Service was spotty and food was not as hot as it could have been. So the diner was just okay to me. The only thing that was really disappointing, for a city hotel of this quality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the issue of street noise from your room. It was pretty bad. I could even here the noise from the hallways, other rooms next door and even the elevator chime. Very annoying! I think with time, this hotel will do well for its self. But the noise issue is a true disappointment. So come for one night to experience the rooftop pool and lounge and then maybe move to a better hotel with better noise control. Would I stay here again? Maybe - but only in the summer, because of the rooftop deck and pool.

The entire hotel is done in a dark hardwood (engineered hardwood?) floor and as a result every little noise echos and magnifies and there is no hope for a quite sleep. We arrived at check-in and at best the staff is there too look good rather than be good, many lessons could be learned if they took walk over to the four seasons and see what service really means. We got in the room and 90% of the windows are frosted with no hope of seeing where you are. No wonder that when my wife had requested a City view, they said that there wasn't one available. We overlooked this and headed to the roof for lunch and the pool. Well, hello beautiful bodies, young women walking around strutting their stuff but no one in the pool and unfortunately us 50 year olds certainly weren't going to be first. Lunch finally came, were did order a bottle of vodka, so i guess we weren't that important. Dinner at Scarpetta was okay but this was only night 2 so i can assume it will get better but based on the wine list, better wait a few years....very few bottles were older than an 07 and nothing much from new world....almost all italians, which is usually good but not when they are so young. Servers were nervous to screw up and as a result they did....they will improve. Back to the rooftop to check out the view of the city at night .... beautiful .... dont stay unless you are under 35, single and believe that you are exceptionally beautiful and wont to get drunk. Off to bed at 11:30pm but couldn't sleep because of the noise in the halls, slamming doors, partying and obnoxious guests. 4:30am finally asleep and then awoken with a loud bang....\"room service\"....what the heck, went to check and it was for the gang just down the hall.

Where do I start? The worst is probably the staff who have are clueless on how to provide upscale service. The service at Thompson Toronto emulates a shopping mall clothing store or a cheesy club, not an upscale hotel or establishment. The staff doesnt go that extra mile and do not understand how to truly defer to their patrons. They are not prepared for the jet-set clientele who will quickly be annoyed with this place. They are good at answering your complaints though. But employees must verify everything. You want to enter the rooftop patio? Let me see your card. You have comped drinks? Let me check that. Its as if you are attending a low-scale nightclub for 19 year olds. There is a subtlety to upscale service which I dont think Thompson Toronto has mastered. For folks who are accustom to upscale service or hotels, stay far far away. Id even recommend holiday inn over this place in terms of customer service. You quickly become annoyed with the staff, who do try, but are just not equipped with the right level of deference to their customers. The elevators require you to use to enter your room key which leads to all kinds of frantic behavior when jumping on or else you end up on the wrong floor. Very annoying. They were bugs/spiders in the hotel room, on the ceiling and on the walls. They were even the remnants of dead bugs on the walls and cielings. They were all kinds of missed details. Like a single robe rather than two in the rooms. The experience at Thompson Toronto feels nothing like a relaxed resort or chill atmosphere of the Ws, Gaanesvoort, Shore Club, Venetian etc. It feels like the opposite - a total hassle. The staff seem confused and have no clue about how to serve their customers. They do try but they are just not prepared nor understand the industry they are in. There is hope for Thompson Toronto as the saving grace is that the rooftop patio is a very nice spot. One of the best looking places in Toronto. Unfortunately, like CiRCA, the opportunity for Thompson Toronto could be squandered by bad management and developing a reputation for annoying their finicky visitors with their low-scale approach to service.

When we checked in, we had the valet park our car for the weekend, and realized at the end of the trip that it was $30 a night, a little pricey compared to the others but safer than parking ourselves. The lobby is a little dusty from all of the construction, and had a very modern layout, with mahogany and bright orange as their theme colors. You need your key to access any floors, which is safe but it took more than one swipe to activate it. When we were escorted to our room, the bellman showed us the layout and the multiple light settings (a little confusing at first) around the room, as we could control all the lights from the nightstand, which was nice. When we came back later on, we had been delivered fresh chocolate covered strawberries as a thank-you treat! We never had a drink at the rooftop bar, but stopped in to look around, and it was indeed beautiful. The weather was also amazing, which never hurts. I would have rather enjoyed lying by the pool during the day though, as it seemed a little cheesy at night. It is open not only to guests, but to condominium owners next door. Our bed was extremely comfortable, however there was construction starting very early in the morning, with people moving around ladders and other supplies. Because the hallway wasn't complete, it still looked a little industrial, more of an office hallway. Touch-up paint was also needed in many areas, including our room, which had a scuff marks on our white walls. The bathroom was gorgeous, with an awesome shower, but they only gave us two towels, and didn't give me any conditioner (which they brought up when we called). I think they're still trying to get organized, though, as there was no alarm clock in our room.

We stayed at the Thompson in NYC and liked it so we were excited to hear that the Thompson Hotel opened in Toronto. The hotel is brand new so a lot of the amenities and none of the restaurants were open or were completed during our stay. So, I cannot give a complete and accurate assessment of the hotel. We booked a Deluxe King room. When we arrived at our room there was a welcome letter on the table. It was a nice gesture, however, it was another guest's name on the envelope and letter. The room had a nice view of the CN Tower. The decor is sleek and modern. The bed was very comfortable. There is a nice, small sitting area by the window. The room had plenty of storage space. The room lacked a clock radio and an ironing board and it only had one bath robe and there were only two bath towels, two hand towels and two face towels. It would be nice if there were at least a couple of extra bath towels so that guests could use them for the pool area or gym. Also, there really should be two bath robes for the room. You can call for more towels and an additional robe and probably for an ironing board but it should be unnecessary for guests to have to ask for these items that are usually mandatory at other hotels. Each room receives a copy of the Globe and Mail newspaper each morning. On our first morning we didn't receive a copy in front of our door. The rooftop pool is a beautiful infinity pool with amazing views of the city. There are two very nice bed loungers by the pool. There is a rooftop bar and lounge area by the pool with 360 degree views of the city which I can forsee becoming a city hotspot. The decor and vibe of the hotel is very hip, cool and modern. The lobby is very spacious with a bar slated to open in the area. The staff was courteous but needs more experience. For example, when my husband called for our car, the girl at the front desk loudly responded with, \"What??????\" She should have replied, \"I'm sorry sir but can you please repeat what you just said?\" Also, when we checked out, the front desk gave us the wrong bill. The hotel is located at Bathurst and Wellington Streets and is a hub of activity. If you walk a block up to King Street, there are many cafes, restaurants and bars. If you walk a bit further up to Queen Street, there are unique indie cafes and shops. There are also some popular clubs nearby within a few minutes walk to the hotel such as the Brant House and the C Lounge. If you want to venture to further parts of the city, you can easily catch a cab or take the Bathurst or King streetcars. Both of these will take you to the subway line. The Bathurst streetcar will take you to the Bloor line and the King streetcar will take you to the Yonge line. Overall, we had a nice stay at the Thompson but I will have to come back again once everything is finished so I can give an updated review. I think once everything is done and it has been in operation for a little longer, the hotel will be an amazing place to stay.
