Be aware Paris is now very very expensive, unless you are a local you are seen as easy target to exhort every last euro out of you.

Just round the corner from The Shakespeare Co. book store too. We had a brilliant room on the 6th floor - views across the Paris roof tops over towards the Pantheon - also had a view of the Eiffel Tower, which I was delighted about! It was our honeymoon and so we were delighted with the romantic feeling and the views from the room. We even had a small balcony which we could both easily fit on, where we ate our lunch of fresh french bread, cheese and ham, and enjoyed the views, what more do you need in Paris!! Room size was excellent for a classic double room, and great size bathroom with bath and shower. Staff were super friendly, all spoke excellent English,but were also very patient when my wife was trying her french out. Very quiet little street, we could not hear anything once we were upstairs. The room and hotel was very clean, and room was serviced every day. Also had tea/coffee making facilities in room for free, and mini-bar fridge if needed. Also, there is a bookshef area in reception which is full of travel books and novels which you can borrow, so we had a great Paris book that we took out with us for the few days we were there. We did not try the breakfast here, but you don't really need to - the area is full of cafes etc. that you can eat in. There was a brilliant boulengerie around the corner, next to Hotel D'Albe which we had a great breakfast in - yoghurts, coffee, fresh orange juice, and danish/croissant - for 13euro for 2 people, which is very reasonable for Paris.

Anyway, this hotel is just 3-5 minutes walk from the nearest exit (Exit 6 on the RER B line) - I was pleasantly surprised by how convenient it is. There's free wifi - a plus for those of us who love to be connected. Some downsides would be the bathroom. It's spacious but doesn't look too clean. I was hoping to soak in the tub but the (slight) mould on the wall and (some) chipped tiles put me off completely. Another downside was the thin walls. We had our neighbour watching tv at 11:30pm, and 7:30am. And we could hear the phone ringing in the next room. That was the most unpleasant part because the bed is really comfortable and it would be nice to just sleep uninterrupted! All in all, I would recommend Parc St Severin still.

We were in Room 33, a comfortable double (spacious by Paris standards) with private bath/WC. We have stayed at this hotel on numerous occasions, and have consistently enjoyed our visits. The price has gone up over the years (our room was 190 euro/night), so it is no longer the bargain that it once was, but still I would stay it was worth what we paid (especially considering the Trip Advisor reviews of other hotels that cost even more) and we will definitely return. What we liked most: * Comfortable airy room (lots of windows) * Friendly staff (desk personnel, breakfast server, chambermaids) * Great location, close to Notre Dame and Rive Gauche attractions * Efficient air conditioning (but the weather was cool enough so that we didn't need it too much) What we liked least: * More outside noise than we had remembered on previous visits, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. This was probably due to the great summer weather, our room being on a lower floor than in the past and thus closer to the alleyway, and the fact that we did not have the air conditioner turned on. Noise was generally not so much an issue during the week, but there was lots of hooting and hollering etc on the weekend till the wee small hours. * Breakfast was expensive (at 13 euro/person/day) but it was convenient taking the buffet at the hotel so we did. A few additional observations and suggestions: * The elevator was smallish (room for two persons comfortably, or one person with luggage) but typical for Paris hotels. I've seen elevators that are much smaller :-) * The desk staff were all fluent in English. * We bought a route map for the Paris buses and used buses rather than the Metro for most of our travel around the city. This was due in part to the fact that my wife has bad knees, and the stairs and correspondences at the Metro would be uncomfortable. But even if one has healthy knees, buses are a great way to see some of the city, and there are lots of bus lines that run down either Blvd San Michel or Blvd St Germain. * One of our favorite restaurants (Pastavino) had closed down, but we discovered two new ones that are excellent, and both are within easy walking distance of the hotel: La Jacobine (in a pedestrian alleyway off of St Ande des Arts), and La Rotisserie d'en Face (on Rue Christine). We had dinner twice at each one, and all of the meals were great. Price was around 70 euro (Jacobine) and 100 euro (Rotisserie) for 3-course dinner for 2 with wine. * One of the more annoying Paris rip-offs is that when you order a taxi to pick you up, the meter will show a charge based on where the taxi was coming from; this can easily be 10 euro or more. It is more economical to walk to a taxi rank and get a cab there. The closest one to the hotel is at the Quai St Michel. * Although by now everyone probably knows this, do not get currency at the Changes; instead, use your bank ATM or checking debit card at an ATM machine (\"Distributeur\") in Paris. This will get you a better exchange rate and, depending on your bank, might not entail any fee.", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "paris", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Parisian setting with wonderful staff!\u201d", "Author": "lizette136", "ReviewID": "UR32006842", "Content": "Ambiance, cleanliness, charm.

The hotel is tucked away and removed from the main streets, and while a taxi rank is by the Seine, they are not always available.

My first trip to Paris (and abroad for 30 years) was in April but on a \"luxury\" company paid trip - 4* hotel (Ambassador) etc. I couldn't afford this myself this time but as a female travelling on her own with only schoolgirl French, wanted somewhere safe, reliable and troublefree. I picked this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and a relatively good internet hotel/flight deal. I had room 42 on the 4th floor - plenty of space, massive bed (not sure if room was single or double), good wardrobe/shelf space (might need a few more hangers for two), extra blankets/pillows in wardrobe which also had a self-set PIN access safe. Laundry service available. Well stocked mini bar in fridge under TV but not much space for your own choccy gifts etc. Lighting a bit dark as only 2 table lamps in main part of room. Manual airconditioning with two settings - bliss when you come back overheated. Fairly decent sized bathroom - fine for one, but maybe a bit of a squeeze for two. Daily cleaning was excellent - you choose whether to have clean towels daily. A few minor blemishes with decor and sink but worse at home, to be honest. I didn't speak to staff much - mainly just to hand in/get key - as trip pre-paid and no help needed with itinerary. However, those on reception were always friendly, patient when I attempted my poor French and spoke English often anyway. I heard them helping other guests with queries, bookings etc. Check-in/out only took seconds and they were happy to look after my suitcase for a couple of hours on the final morning. One of the ladies who brought my breakfast up was especially friendly and chatty but my poor French prevented us having much of a conversation. Location mainly was a plus - great transport links with 2 Metro stops very close and one of the main RER stops to go to/from CDG airport (30 mins approx). A couple of minutes walk from Notre Dame and I also walked to a number of other sights from hotel, mainly using the Metro to go further afield or go back at night or to drop off shopping. There is a real buzz in that area - unofficial meeting place at the Fontaine St Michel, shops and numerous bistros/cafes in the streets roundabout. I was a bit put off by some of the eateries in Rue de la Harpe but probably just as I was on my own. I found a couple of nice places to eat - nothing fancy but good value for money (nothing over 25 euros for main meal, dessert and drink) with wide choice and variety of prices. However, if you can't eat cheese, dairy or mushrooms (like me - diet problem not just fussy!) you will have problems as one or more is in most dishes. Location was also a negative. As the area was so busy and so many people around having late meals there was a fair amount of noise in the early hours - shouting, laughing, arguing. The hotel is on the edge of a quiet pedestrianised section and sound from passers though carried more than I expected - I got woken up a couple of times a night. I was also aware of the noise on the boulevards close by - especially the mopeds. (In the hotel itself , it was quite disconcerting to stand in the bathroom and hear the guests in the room above going to the toilet!!) Breakfast was great on the first morning with 2 pieces of fruit but all other mornings only one piece including an inedible banana and there was no hot water for my tea on the final morning. (you tick your choices with any extras on a card you hang on your doorknob). Probably wouldn't have had these problems if I'd eaten it in the breakfast room but it was so nice having a leisurely breakfast in my room with the window open listening to the sounds of Paris waking up and getting the day started. Also the lift is very small - one person, one suitcase. I used the stairs at other times but got a bit dizzy by the time I reached the 4th floor as it's a bit of a tight spiral. The light switch is just inside on the left - I missed it altogether the first time and I don't recommend doing the stairs in the dark! Depite the minor niggles including lack of sleep, I loved staying here and am missing it already. Although I crave the breakfast of the Ambassador (you name it, they had it & as much as you could eat) cost will probably prevent me going there again and Parc St Severin will now be top of my list for next year. A lovely friendly calm oasis in the hustle and bustle of the area and Paris - easy to get to and a great central place to start from for all your sightseeing trips.", "Date": "September 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cBang for Location\u201d", "Author": "ElizabethMaryland", "ReviewID": "UR8588583", "Content": "Elizabeth from Maryland August 29, 2007 We have just come back from a 4 night/5 day stay at this small cozy hotel in the left bank of Paris. It took me months to research this trip, taking everything into consideration (cost, location, amenities). If your aim is to absorb as much of Paris in a few days, this is the location for you. The Louvre, Musee D'orsay, Notre Dame, a boat ride on the Seine, the Pantheon and of course the Saint Severin Church are pretty much in your doorstep. Not to mention Cafe's and restaurants on the side streets around the hotel. The staff spoke English and were very friendly and helpful. They had umbrellas for us when it rained one day and helped us find our way around. I just told them where we were going and they plotted out our walking plan and the occassional bus and metro ride. Our room had 2 balconies with cascading flowers, a clean and modern bathroom with a tub and shower, a safe, anda small refrigerator. Basically it was clean and simple and roomy enough for Paris standard. It was elegant without going over the top. I'd been to Paris a couple of times before and knew not to expect a huge elevator or ice machines around the corner or even a shower curtain in the bathroom (I guess Parisians like to take baths and not showers). We were very happy with this hotel particularly the fabulous location.", "Date": "August 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Olney, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cParisian home away from home\u201d", "Author": "TripGen", "ReviewID": "UR8465510", "Content": "I've stayed at this hotel twice this year so far, in April and in July, and I'm going back again next week (late August). I have stayed at quite a few hotels in Paris over the last 20 years, but have settled on this hotel as my \"Parisian home away from home\". I travel often with my young adult children (early 20s), and they really like the location. Very touristic area, to be sure, but lively and fun, and close to several Metro and RER stations . As others have said, the rooms are not super-chic, but they are clean, mostly good-sized rooms with nice large bathrooms. Even the small single rooms, one of which my godson stayed in, are really nice with good-sized baths (especially for a French hotel.) Staff is very helpful and friendly. I don't usually take the breakfast because there are just so many choices within 2-3 minutes walk. Do wander outside of this area, however, for more authentic French food, when you tire of the various ethnic restaurants.", "Date": "August 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cA gem in a great location!\u201d", "Author": "PokeyPaddler", "ReviewID": "UR8263008", "Content": "We enjoyed a small but pleasant, simply decorated room with a nice sized, up-to-date private bathroom.

The hotel is very clean with excellent service, with a very pleasant sitting room and dining room on the main level. The location is ideal. This part of Paris has a relaxed, social atmosphere. Just outside the door of the hotel, along every street, are reasonably priced cafes and restaurants offering the daily Le Menu for a fixed price, as well as the specialties of the house; museums, La Sorbonne and shopping galore. One block and we were at the famous Boulevard St. Germaine and the Metro stop, if one is not up to a walk. Two blocks to the River Seine; three blocks to Notre Dame Cathedral and the Museum below. We walked just about everywhere from the hotel, but took the metro back after a long day the the Musee D'Orsay or the Louvre.

This airport is in the middle of nowhere. So we opted to take the bus into Paris. We purchased the bus ticket right at baggage claim before our bags arrived. This seemed the best option because when we exited baggage claim there was a line forming to purchase tickets outside. The ride took a little more then an hour to get to the drop-off location, where we got on the metro and headed to the center of town. We purchased a 3 day pass for 3 regions. This was the best option since almost everything was in these three regions. Once we arrived at the hotel, about 12:45, we asked for a room. At first they said the did not have a room and it would be an hour or so. After further asking where we could put our bags and if they would be safe, the desk assistant made a few calls and a room became vacant. I wanted to make sure the room was non-smoking and at that point I was informed that there were NO non-smoking rooms in the hotel, however if there is an issue we could open the windows and all would be fine. I was a bit weary, but decided to just go with the flow. As we walked into the small closet size elevator, where our bags could hardly fit inside with us, we pushed floor 3, and then proceeded down the freshly painted drab military gray walls to room 34. I felt as if I was actually on a military ship, the way the lighting hit the grey walls. When we entered the room, it was nicely prepared, however the walls had chipped paint, stains on the beddings and on the carpet. The room did not smell to bad, so we opted to keep it. We had a long flight from Rome so we wanted to freshen up and take a shower. This is when the SHOCK happed. We looked for the shower and could not find it. We did find a bath-tub with a shower wound and no shower curtain. We proceeded to enter the bathtub squatted uncomfortably and had my friend help me shower. This was odd and a bit uncomfortable. We then let the room for a wonderful day in Paris. Our first stop was the Mc Donald\u2019s just around the corner from the hotel. This was a mistake for the fact that both of our hamburgers we got were RAW!!!! When we pointed that out to the manager he was like, what\u2019s the problem. We said we wanted them cooked. He then took them and seriously 15 min. later we received our better cooked hamburgers. I would recommend the Crape maker just outside the door of Mc Donald\u2019s. We came back in the evening, after visiting the many sights in Paris, to rest and go on the Internet. Again this hotel had no Internet access. This was the third hotel with no free Internet access, however I recognized that if I had BOINGO access I would be able to access all these internet points for free. The hotel, however, would sell Internet access for $5 for 45 min access and $30 for a day access. Now this was crazy, since I could use the same network with BOINGO for only $9.99 a month. So note to everyone, purchase BOINGO for only $9.99 a month access before you go on your European vacation and save your self the headache plus expense. So now, at about 12 midnight, the lamp light busted and well everything went out, including the TV. The surge must have blown a fuse. Anyways we decided just to sleep. In the morning we realized that there was a 1/2 drank coke soda in the refrigerator and no tissue in the bathroom. After a quick SQUIRT DOWN by my friend, we headed down the stairs, instead of using the closet size elevator. When we approached the front desk, we had a list of things that needed to be repaired, including asking what happened to the shower curtain and shower. In response to the shower/shower curtain, we were told that in France no one takes a shower and that\u2019s why it\u2019s designed like that. The strange part was, everyone that we noticed in the hotel were Americans. Anyways they said they did have a few rooms with a shower curtain, however since they were fully booked there was none available. They said they would correct the other problems in the room. I also asked about breakfast and was told there was No free continental breakfast here either (come on for $200 a night you would think they would offer you something, right?) So we left and went just around the corner to the same McDonalds and had a Latte and Croissant. Again there was a problem here. I had a discussion with the helper why did they only fill the coffee cup 1/2 way. This was strange since the photo showed the cup being filled up all the way. I asked them to please fill it up all the way and they did not. Anyway, we noticed a Starbucks just across the street and decided to do our future coffee purchases there. When we returned the rooms outlets were working again, and there was tissues were in the bathroom. The towels were the same as from the previous day, and we were told that is because they are being more earth safe in not washing everything every day. There was still no shower curtain. We eventually fell asleep and in the morning, woke to rain. Packed our bags and headed to the airport. For the price of the hotel, its not worth it. It\u2019s no more then a $100 a night hotel for the services they are offering and the visual sight and dirtiness of this place. I\u2019ve been in a lot more hotels nicer then this place for 1/2 the cost.
