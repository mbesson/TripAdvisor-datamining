The rooms were cleaned every day and the place was spotless, the only problem with our rooms was the lack of a wardrobe and there were no coffee making facilities. However, for the price that we paid (a twin room worked out at roughly \u00a3240 for 7 nights) and for the little time that we were planning to stay it was perfect. Our only issue was the area. We were warned countless number of times by taxi drivers that the area we were staying in was really bad. We were warned to stay away from the park (MacArthur Park) and not to walk alone especially at night, when we were told not to go out at all. This was backed up by any locals that we spoke to. There are a lot of homeless in that area and people trying to sell fake ID. Occasionally we did have to walk back to the motel from LA Live and it felt a very threatening place to be at night, however, if you are willing to take taxis everywhere then it is a very reasonably priced place to stay. I wouldn't recommend this for families, but if you are travelling on your own, are not planning to spend much time in the motel and are looking for a base for a few days that is cheap, then this place is just right", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cok, but beware!\u201d", "Author": "George_stayed_here", "ReviewID": "UR123267778", "Content": "Booked 2 rooms on one reservation.

The only two rooms available were one of the two that I had reserved, and the jacuzzi suite. Clerk told me jacuzzi suite was very expensive and thus unavailable. After threatening to go and stay with a friend, thus nullifying both rooms' reservations, the clerk relented and gave me the jacuzzi suite. Still charged an extra $10 though. I thanked him and told him I'd give them a \"good review\". My definition of \"good\" is 3 stars, though they deserve zero stars for the incompetence of whomever was responsible for losing the second room on my reservation. Rooms were above average w/rspct to amenities and cleanliness. Kids throwing football in parking lot hit my brand new car. Lady smoking joint on balcony near our room. Neighborhood is somewhat \"sketchy\". Would not want to walk at night. Hotel is arranged like a walled compound (to keep some of the bad elements out)?

When I called the front desk to report any problems, they basically told me that it's not their problem, and refused to move me to another room. There is a sign when you check in that states NO REFUNDS, so the owner does give a s--t about you after taking your money. Although the property is within walking distance to the convention center, the area is very sketchy at night.

The area seemed safe during the day, but we avoided going out after dark, as there were a lot of unsavory looking people loitering on the streets. The hotel staff were nice and helpful. The room was a decent size, with a flatscreen tv, fridge, microwave, desk and plenty of clothes storage space. The channel selection was limited, even though the hotel advertises cable and HBO. The sheet and underlay kept coming off the bed during the night, as they weren't fitted. This was annoying, but at least there was no sign of bedbugs. We were in a ground floor room and the noise of people in the room upstairs regularly woke us up. The smell of bleach in our room was overwhelming when we first arrived and it was hard to air out the room. Our bathroom was next to an alley that housed a few homeless people, so we were wary of opening the window. The breakfast selection looked bland and sugary. I took my own muesli into the dining room and no staff objected to that. The internet connection was poor inside the rooms and kept dropping out. I had to sit in the car, parked outside our room, to talk on skype.

Every time we had a question, we received very short \"get out of my face soon\" answers. We did not feel welcome at all. I made 2 reservations and plans changed to where i needed to come in 1 day earlier for our event. I called and it sounded as if they were previously asleep and did not want to speak to me because the phone rang for about 5 minutes. Upon arrival, they had switched only 1 of the rooms to the correct dates and although the parking lot was empty, they said \"no rooms.\" Again, upon arrival, i had to ring the door bell multiple times for them to finally come to the front desk and received us with messed up hair, heigene, and blood shot eyes. SLEEPING! Then another man came out and said, \"we have plenty of rooms.\" They put us in room 204 or whatever the last room top right of the building, and it smelled like urine BIG TIME, toilet did not flush, carpet was heavily soiled, Hair on the beds, tv stand was broken as if they were using it for parts, used soap in the bathroom, and numerous of other things! When we brought it to their attention, they said \"ok\" and simply hung up. I got really upset and went down stairs. By the time i got there, the man who said \"we have many rooms\" had keys to 2 rooms with kings. It was 4 of us so we needed rooms with 2 beds but this was somewhat accomodating considering what we had already saw and heard from the other man that was there! The next day, they gave us the room that we had originally reserved and had to move our stuff again. Beds were soo hard that sleeping on the floor with a sleeping bag felt a lot better. No shampoo at all. Bathroom was moldy and the rooms were very run down. Needless to say...we chose this location because it was convenient to the convention center. I don't know if America's Best Value Inn ever get QA inspections, but this facility DEFINITELY needs one soon considering the service received and the quality of the rooms.
