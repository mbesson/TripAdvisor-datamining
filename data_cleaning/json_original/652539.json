{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Location. Terrible Front Desk The location was great, and the room was small, but comfortable and clean. And the price was right. We ate breakfast at small cafes, but heard that the hotel breakfast was very nice. The pool is small. There is free internet, and the air-conditioning was great. If you get a room over the lobby area, it can be noisy if they have a group in house.I would recommend this hotel as long as you don't expect the front desk to be accomodating or friendly. They are not. Barcelona though is a wonderful city. We spent 4 days there. We recommend the Hop On Hop off bus, and anything Gaudi. We took a walking tour of the old city. We stayed in the Room-Mate chains in Madrid and Granada and would certainly highly recommend any Room-Mate hotel as your best bet both for comfort, cleanliness, location, and great staff and wonderful breakfast (included).", "Date": "Jul 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR521067696", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "nfeller"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d652539-r8235444-Hotel_J_Balmes-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "652539", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
