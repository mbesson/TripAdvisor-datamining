First of all, the staff at this \"hotel\" were so unfriendly and one of the men there didn't even speak english very well. The rooms were really dirty ( I don't think they were being cleaned every day ) and where was that safety box?! We also experienced that a few people got some money stolen from their room. The lady in the reception even admitted that one of the cleaning ladies had \"cleaned up\" in one of the suitcases. Only one of the men in the reception was nice and at least he spoke english. Second of all, the breakfast was horrible! - There was not a lot to choose from.

The galaxy is just round the corner and still very central to the train station. We were asked to provide a 20 euro deposit for the key which was so heavy we didnt want to lug it anywhere in any case. There were 4 of us on a two week trip of europe in the one room, the room was very clean, modern and quiet, excellent value in dec 2010. Breakfast was fresh and the perfect amount to set us up for the 3 days we were there. On the last day we had to catch an early train and we had breakfast at the mirage as too early for galaxy times which was fine with us. The deposit was never mentioned on checkout and as we were in a rush to get to our train we forgot to ask for it. When i emailed to ask if it could be posted i had no response so emailed again, to which they offered us 20 euro credit next time but no other alternative. Two of our group were from new zealand and unlikely to return so this wasnt great. Its also 40 dollars nz which is quite a bit to never see again for a key! I do understand hotels must get slacked off with people not returning keys and cards but i felt the hotel could have posted the money back or put it on our card.

All my emails confirmed my request for two rooms at Hotel Mirage. When we arrive at 4 PM we were taken up the Hotel Mirage elevator, taken out a door into a connecting building and shown two rooms in Hotel Halifax. Neither room was the quality of the Hotel Mirage, the door where we exited the Hotel Mirage did not allow return access. There is no elevator to the 5th floor where our rooms were in Hotel Halifax. The staff, two disagreeable women, refused to change the rooms, were rude, lied about the condition of Hotel Halifax and refused to admit we did not have the what I reserved. They repeatedly said the rooms were the same in both hotels. We went out to look for another hotel without success. After dinner when we returned I found my single room was dirty, had a used pair of women's underwear behind the luggage stand, vintage dust bunnies under the bed and in every corner, smelled of sewer gas off and on during the three days, ONE TOWEL, no bath mat for the slippery wet tile floor and no cups for water were in the room. I was finally given a small towel the third day. The sheets were not clean and they were replaced the following day. I drank a bottle of water from the filthy refrigerator and told the desk I would not pay for it because there were no cups in the room. I got two cups. The \"lobby\" of Hotel Halifax has mattresses stored behind the curtains. Fire code anyone? These were the last three days in Italy after 23 great days in Sicily where there are far fewer tourist facilities but with great experiences. When you know you have a returning customer bringing more customers would it not be good business to develop more customers in the same way. The women at the desk were the two most disagreeable people, probably not Italian, I had the displeasure to deal with. They blamed co-workers when clearly they were the ones in charge. They should be ashamed to represent Italy. I wish I knew I this site accepted photos. That dirty thong lying in the dust bunnies was quite the still life.", "Date": "October 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "earth", "Title": "\u201cA TERRIBLE hotel.\u201d", "Author": "nokard", "ReviewID": "UR18309283", "Content": "My friends and I (3 of us) found this place by just walking in and thinking it looked nice and the price seemed reasonable for a 3 star hotel. We gave a $20 (euro) deposit for the key to our room (which was given back when we left) and we had to pay the full amount up front for our stay. The hotel building is also shared by at least one other hotel. We had to use the entrance of the other hotel to use the elevator to get up to our room. There was no elevator from our hotel entrance, only stairs. The airconditioning in our room was not as cold as we would have liked it to be and we had the fan on the maximum setting. The towels smelled like vinegar and the bed sheets had many hairs in them after close inspection. I think the place had bed bugs because we were all slapping and scratching ourselves throughout the 2 night we stayed. One morning we awoke early to someone talking loudly in the hallway outside our room.That same morning my friend found some kind of \"finger\" nail with hair or fur on it that he had been sleeping on. Uugghh!!! Breakfast was included, but we avoided it. There were some cold cuts, toast, cereal, jam, orange juice and warm yogurt that was out for who knows how long. The drinking glasses were all different shapes and sizes and had many scratch markings on them. Outside the hotel at night didn't have a safe feeling. There were some \"shady\" characters out there.The only good thing about this place is that it's near the Termini train station which makes getting around Rome more easy.

It\u00b4s terrible and so are most people who work there.\u201d", "Author": "Marlos_Sousa", "ReviewID": "UR13146682", "Content": "I promised my mom we would be in Rome for her birthday celebration. And so we arrived the night before coming from Pisa. At first when we arrived the girl in the reception noted in my mom\u00b4s passport her upcoming birthday and congratulated her. I though that to be so kind of her. However, our following experiences at Hotel Mirage were not that good at all. Although not mentioned on its website, I was not allowed to pay with my credit card. In accordance with the lady in the reception, that policy was due to a highly discounted rate... I know they have the right to refuse credit cards if they want, but I would highly appreciate if that was stated clearly in their website. In my case, I had a credit card that permitted international withdrawals, but there might be someone who could not get cash abroad to pay for it. The second problem was regarding the breakfast. Well, not the breakfast itself, but the badly educated girl that was responsable for the breakfast room. At first she was able to speak only italian. No English at all, no French, No Spanish, just Italian. I know Italian is the official language of Italy, but being Rome a tourist city and being that Hotel dedicated to tourist (at least I imagine that because it is actually located beside Rome\u00b4s main train station), it would be a great deal if all of its employees could speak at least basic words in English, like milk, coffee, water, well, these may make you imagine that she could not speak no English at all.... and that was true. The other problem with this girl is that she was so rude... she could not spek softly, but she screamed at all time, making one think that she was making you a great favor to let you have the breakfast you had paid for.... I am sorry, but I can't cope with stupid people... To complete mu unsatisfaction with that hotel, at 10:30am someone was knocking on my door and screaming loudly in Italian... I really don\u00b4t know what she was screaming, but I can imagine that she complained cos I did not leave the room before that time. However, to my knowledge, there was no time to leave the rooms or to arrive... otherwise that hotel would not be a hotel, but a hostel... She did not start her show outside until I woke up and open the door. For my surprise and disgust, she was the same girl that I had problems in the breakfast... We had a terrible discussion in the aisle, but I imagine she did not understand anything I said at all. To finalize, the day before we checked out I was asked to pay for our stay (I stayed 4 nights there). However, the lady in the reception said that I was not given back my 20 euro deposit until we check out next morning, because she was affraid we would take home her remote control and room key... Well, as you can imagine, I would never recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be in a good place to enjoy all of Rome's attractions. By staying there you\u00b4ll certainly get into disgusting troubles that may compromise you Rome visit. Not to forget, although the rooms are small, they\u00b4re quite confortable, but it\u00b4s worth mentioning that they turn on heating around 10 pm and turn it off at 7:00. Therefore the remaing of the day your room gets very cold if you travel in winter like I did. Also, although there\u00b4s an air conditions device in the room we cannot use it because it\u00b4s opperated with a remote control that does not exist. To summarize, forget this hotel. If you want to be next to Termini Station in Rome there are plenty of hotels nearby.... everywhere you look in this street and also on Via Marsala beside the station there are hotels and restaurants... so it wont be any trouble to find another better place to stay with competitive prices.", "Date": "January 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "citizen of the world", "Title": "\u201cNice economy hotel\u201d", "Author": "chomskey_on_the_rox", "ReviewID": "UR6775189", "Content": "Nice for a few days' stay, clean, we had typical Italian breakfast [coffee + croissant/roll], friendly staff, good location if you want to do some sightseeing [centre], although the near Termini station attracts plenty of weird guys.
