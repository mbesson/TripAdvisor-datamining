Not only was the price great for the location and amenities, but the staff were very helpful and friendly as well. The Inn/room was very clean but our room was a bit cramped for 5 people. We had 2 queens and squeezed and roll away in there. Parking is also free. There is a shuttle bus that will drive within a 2 mile radius which worked great for us as the University was just down the road and we didn't have to worry about driving and parking fees at the UW. For those wanting to take the bus, there is a bus stop a few blocks away so the walk isn't too bad. The only thing I found wrong and the kids were a bit disapointed in was that the hot tub was down however since the pool was operational, it was only us adults that really missed the hot tub. The next time we go to seattle for ball, I will stay here again. I originally had a hard time trying to find a hotel to stay at that was cheap enough for 5, had a pool for the kids and during the first week in July due to not only Independance day and travelers but the Lions club was also having a get to together/parade with other members from around the world.

My Fiance and I are moving to Seattle in a year and we wanted to stay a weekend and do Seattle the right way. As we were driving up our clutch and flywheel fried and we had to have our car towed to Kent which was a ways away and would make us late for our check-in time. We wound up being two hours late and there was no extra charge. The front desk informed us that our reservation was good until midnight. What a wonderful policy. That night we went walking in the neighborhood which was close to a shopping mall, drug store, and plenty of restaurants. When we settled into our room we found it was clean (fresh smelling, clean towels and new items, no bugs of any sort) and very comfy. I didn't like the duvet cover on the bed but that is a minor annoyance and not a big deterrent. The bed was really soft and the TV was quite large. Even though there was a wedding party going on there we didn't hear a peep in our room. We both slept like babies. The water pressure was good too, which is one of my major pet-peeves with other hotels. We ate breakfast there, I was surprised to find that they have a full, complimentary breakfast! Fantastic! Then, we used the shuttle which dropped us off at a bus stop and we went down to the Westlake station where we could connect to any part of the city via public transportation. A warning though, I think the Monorail demagnetized our room keys and we had to have them reprogrammed at the front desk. They wanted our reservation information and ID's to do that so just be warned. The pool was nice but somewhat strange as anyone sitting in the dinning area can see you swimming in the pool. I can't speak to the comfort of the spa jets as the motor was out. They had it repaired the day after we left.

I shopped around and a week and a half before most of the hotels downtown were booked or needed my right arm for payment since it still works I decided to look outside the downtown area. That meant about $20 outside of downtown by taxi with light traffic. The University area was recommended by a forumn so I looked at the silver cloud. I got the last room and at a cheaper rate which was nice but still on the upper end of my budget but I am cheap. I arrived via a wild goose chase, that gps sent me on, surprising how if you mix up one digit how fussy those thing can get!! Well I had driven by it several times in my chase and missed it even when I had corrected my navigation. The Foliage out front had foiled my recon. I checked in quickly and noticed that the staff was definitely a notch above from what I am used to dealing with, they were profession, obvious, and neatly attired. They at the time, were checking in Senoirs and treated them like gold and I saw this more than once on my stay. The breakfast room/lounge with coffee and tea all day is just to the left of the Front Lobby. The lounge also is the shares a wall of the inside pool which is flank by windows for you viewing pleasure. I saw no such pleasure during my stay though. Off to the room, I missed the shuttle so I had to walk, just kidding but man are those hallways long. To me, a room is a room, is a room. When I do pay a lot for a hotel room, it's because of demand (location) so they don't spend a lot of money on the accoutrements . This place was not like this, very nice but don't expect the Ritz. Oooohh a fridge and a micowave hidden below the TV, maybe I had forgotten about this but I was glad to have a place to put a cold beverage. The fridge in the end made my drink a little too icy cold. Some one had turned down the control and it made for somewhat slushy drinks, still drinkable though. The internet is the old wired kind wired kind so bring your own wires. This may seem like an inconvience but most wifi at hotels is spotty and inconsistent so throughput was high and so was I, surforically speaking. I was happy as a lobster that will never turn red. The parking is tight, if you have a Smart car it will be commodious, if you have an mid sized SUV your going to take up more than one stall and if you arrive late you might be SOL. I have a compact car and it's definitely door ding heaven for a autobody guy. It especially nice when you see a white mailbu taking up two space on purpose to avoid such periles. I ALMOST....Periled him. Location, pretty good. Their is a newish mall just down the hill called University Village . http://www.uvillage.com/welcome/ William-Sonoma, VS, Crate and Barrel, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn for kids, Restoration Hardware store, a local chocolate store called Frans, a large two Floor Barnes and Noble with two caf\u00c3\u00a9's?, two sweet shops, two confection shops, plus more, and a fried chicken store called QFC. Quality Fried Chicken hmm it was so large it could have been a grocery store and then again maybe... There are several Starbucks on site, the largest one you really don't need to buy coffee in, as the level of decibals is enough to wake the dead. I guess it was Sunday morning. Their is a street called university something with a collection of bars, shops, eating est. not far and definitely gear for the local demographic that's worth checking out. I went for a walk up the hill and past Barf Donalds , Papajohns pizza, econotune for cars and Local fast food joint called Kidd Valley. http://kiddvalley.com/ It seemed to be the favourite of the town with all the \"best of\" awards on the walls. The shake was good, the fish thingee I chose was nothing special but burgers are their mainstay. If you need your Volvo serviced or traded their is a dealer ship at the top of the hill also. Their were a Italian or fancy pizza restaurant and Mexican restaurant on the other side of the road. I also hear, their is a University near by if your into to that kind of thing. The bed was comfy and the room was extremely quiet for a hotel. I had issues with the tv. Normally I don't even turn the thing on but I just wanted to look at the weather channel. It's optimized for Pay for View so the local channels are all fuzzy and to many button pushes away for my liking. If you remember what channel, and input it directly after getting out of the payperview menu it is slighty easier but still fuzzy. For some reason I got a wake up call at 9. I was just about to go back to sleep, when I realized that I could take advantage of the free breakfast I had missed out at the last 4 places I had stayed at. I knew I might be getting the remains of the morning but hey, I was up and hungry and in for a pleasant shock. The place was packed. They had real food, snausages, scrambled eggs, coffee, juice, begals, toast, fruit, and a place you could make your own waffles. I was enamoured by this process and anticipation of fresh waffles. Don't for get to spray each side of the waffler maker and pour the batter from the cup provided by the batter dispenser quickly on to the waffle iron. I did it slowly and then tried to add more batter which just ended up runniing over once I flipped the iron to do it's thing. First and only place I have ever had this opportunity. I am either a 5am checkerouter or a right to the wire and this time I left the room at exactly 12noon to take one of two trips to load the car to leave. I couldn't get back in to the hotel, some one let me in, then I could not get back into the room. I asked the maids for help but I had to go to the front desk to re activate my card. I paid more but got more. The staff are good at their jobs because it's what they do for a living and the place reflects that. It is also means they look after the details which is probably why I couldn't get back in my room after checkout time. Would I stay again, if I could fanagle a bit cheaper rate to assauge my scottish frugality, Yup. The rates here reflect the value and level of service. You pay more and their is more, which where I live isn't all that common. Remember though, it's just a hotel don't expect it to change your life. On a final note the foliage at the front provided a nice recluse with two benchs and an ashtray for those who want a smoke outside (non smoking hotel and legally away from the front door ). The location puts you very close to the streets and traffic but the foliage provides a quieting effect that works well.

Here at a very minimalist place, the staff not only stated they would run our heavy bags to our room - they actually did it!

An excellent way to start the stay! 2. When we arrived, we asked to take the shuttle to the U District. It was occupied when we arrived. But rather than make us wait, the same Front Desk people gave directions on how to walk over to the U District via the Burke-Gillman trail.
