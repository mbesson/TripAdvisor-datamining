{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good Basic Motel The Oceanview Motel is a good basic motel in a very convenient location for the west side of SF at the corner of Judah and the Great Highway (Hwy 1). It was relatively inexpensive and though it is a bit old and worn, effort is obviously made to keep the rooms clean and neat. We had room 132 on the top floor facing the rear (parking area) which is a good choice in that it faces away from the convenient but noisy N-Judah Line streetcar which turns around right outside the front door of the motel with a fare amount of squealing noise right through the night (bring ear plugs). This room is also at the end of the indoor hall and shares only one wall with another room so it is quiet in that way, as well. The N-Judah takes you straight to 9th and Irving, 2 blocks south of Golden Gate Park and the Cal. Academy of Science and DeYoung museums. If you stay on it, it will also take you all the way across town. Next door to the motel is the great Java Beach Cafe, a neighborhood coffee shop that serves oatmeal and pastries for breakfast as well as sandwiches and salads all day, as well as many coffee and tea drinks. The ocean is right across the Great Highway, steps away. The wonderful Beach (and Park) Chalet Brewpub is .7 miles and walking distance north along the Great Highway from the motel. It was nice to park the car at the motel and just take the bus/streetcar around to see the sights. Bus line 18 goes along the Great Highway if you want to go up to the Cliff House, Legion of Honor, or the great Land's End hiking trail with its fabulous views of the ocean and Golden Gate Bridge. For it's great location, public transportation access, and relatively low price for the city, we were very happy with our two night stay at the Oceanview Motel.", "Date": "Dec 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR536218872", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Thriftymom1"}, {"Content": "Don't Stay Here!!!!

The Oceanview Hotel is a great place to stay if you would like to see San Francisco like a local. It is situated in a neighborhood. Right next door is the Java Beach Cafe, a local coffee bar. Hang out with the locals or go across the street and walk the beach.We live a few miles away in Sausalito but wanted to stay in the city for convenience. Our plans were to go to the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass concert in Golden Gate Park.We arrived midday on Friday. Parking is on a first come basis and we easily got a spot. Our room was on the second floor facing Judah Street. The room was very basic, but clean and neat. It had what we needed. It is definitely not luxury, but the price is unbelievable for San Francisco and the location. It is in a wonderful location: a block from the ocean and on a major transit line. The Judah Line will take you where you need to go or connect. It is a few blocks from Golden Gate Park.If you are sensitive to sounds, ask for a room away from Judah. Honestly, the street noise did not keep us awake or was any way obtrusive. We'd definitely would stay there again and recommend it to friends.I gave it 3 stars so as not to exceed expectations. But, if you go into it with the right attitude, it is 4 stars because of its cleanliness and friendly front desk staff.", "Date": "Oct 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR132037091", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "fuelgrrl"}, {"Content": "Close to Beach My friend and I enjoyed our stay there. Our room was facing the main street, but there were no major noise issues. Amenities are very basic as you'd expect in any motel. We needed an iron, but they didn't have one that we could borrow. A coffee shop is conveniently located next to the motel seemed to be a popular neighborhood hang out. We enjoyed our breakfast there. We chose this motel for free parking.

The neighborhood has several excellent restaurants, and is outside the usual touristy parts of Frisco. It's not hard to find a laundromat, gas station, convenience store, video store, or public transit. A comfortable coffee shop next door has free Wifi though the motel itself does not.It's about 45 minutes away from downtown by trolley, but if you're a nature lover who'd rather see Ocean Beach, Golden Gate Park, and Land's End instead of Fisherman's Wharf or Japantown, you can't find a better location.As long as you just want a comfortable place to stay and aren't looking for bellhops, room service, and other four star amenities, and don't mind being on the far western part of town, you should be happy here.", "Date": "May 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR659000662", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "elharo"}, {"Content": "Transit friendly       beach across from Motel looking north towards Cliff House", "Date": "Apr 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR596740409", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "RailRanger"}, {"Content": "this was ok       alcatraz", "Date": "Sep 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR390272578", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lucyspoon"}, {"Content": "Not Bad For The Money I recently stayed at the Oceanview and while it isn't the greatest motels in The City, for the cost, it is pretty decent. The couple who run the motel, are I believe Indian and are very nice. I did notice that the windows don't lock, and in fact our window could have fallen out of the track and crashed on the floor if I wasn't the careful sort, but overall the hotel is clean, easy to get to and very close to the beach which is really nice.

It was convenient since she lives on the N Judah streetcar line that ends in front of the hotel. Also nice if you want to walk on the beach, which is wonderful at sunset. What isn't so nice is that it is near a public toilet facility that attracts less than desirable folk. The room was dark and dingy, barely okay for a place to sleep. Only one key. Windows dirty. It seems like a lot of the rooms are rented long term, although I am not sure. I would not recommend it and will not stay there again.

First thing we saw: the windows couldnt lock, and the emergency stairs platform was right there. On our complaint we were given another room: same problem (due to saline corrosion it seems). In a rude way, the manager said we could get our money back and leave. We stayed a night and moved the next day across the street to the BEACH HOTEL, same price, frendlier and safer.
