Here's my thoughts and I can be a tough critic sometimes. As a Diamond was upgraded to a Junior Suite on the lower floors (level 5) was told they only have their suites on the lower floors. I thought bah - it'll be a suite, so i'm fine. Actually this was great, because like others have said. My gosh the lifts - they actually have 3 not 2, but yes I can understand why someone could wait 15 minutes for a lift! I always used the stairs - so perhaps if you do have some status go for a room on a lower floor as a suite. Given two bottles of water at checkin. The breakfast in the restaurant was REALLY bad, i mean it's the worst doubletree breakfast i've ever had. The selection was basically hampton inn standard. I was looking forward to an amazing breakfast but was very let down, and the staff in the breakfast room were quite unprofessional, ask if I wanted any juice, I said grapefruit, they said you can go and get it yourself. So much for asking. They also tended just to chatter amongst themselves and how little work they had to do rather than focus on the guests. I thought it was really unprofessional. The checkin staff were very helpful. Location wise - if you want to be in lower manhattan or the business district this is of course ideal, but otherwise it is certainly a long trek up to midtown, so think wisely if this is for you. I found the room very dark and dingey and like others have said the bathroom was like being on a cruise ship it was very small indeed with no space to put anything. The decor was modern and nice and had two LCD tv's. Although asking for a quiet room away from elevators, I guess they compromised and gave me the junior suite. What I didn't enjoy was they put a 1yo kick next door who cried all night and I got very little sleep. Not much you could do. Overall I don't think this is a 'bad' hotel - it's new, modern, clean, but it just has a few rough edges. And sadly because the location was not ideal for me - I'd rather be midtown, but the rate was good and everything in midtown was sold out on a saturday night, it was a compromise. I'd give it a 4/5, but because they really could have done so much better than a hampton inn style breakfast, i'll keep it at a 3/5. If the breakfast was improved it would get a solid 4/5.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cthe Worst\u201d", "Author": "Julia W", "ReviewID": "UR126610129", "Content": "This is the lowest review I've ever given to any hotel or restaurants.

I asked where the nearest 24 hour drug store was and showed them my map which they had never seen before - which surprised me as it showed all the subway stations and bus routes in lower Manhattan (go to the MTA website, then Maps, then Lower Manhattan map to get it). I chose the hotel due to the price (c. $130 per night) and although it isn't close to many of the sights, many subway lines are on the doorstep, particularly the 4/5 going up the East Side, and the 1 going up the West Side. The room itself was fine, on the 40th floor, with a view over the Freedom Tower which was nothing special, but at least I wasn't looking at a brick wall out of the window. The bathroom was clean (but only had a shower, no bath) and the bed comfortable. Only once out of about a dozen times did I have to wait more than a couple of minutes for the lift. I stayed for 4 nights, and had breakfast in the hotel each day - on the Friday morning there was a line/queue and I had to wait for about 10 minutes, but the other days I could sit down straight away. I got free internet access as a Hilton Diamond member, but otherwise I would feel a bit ripped off having to pay $10 per day - many peer hotels give it away free these days.

I think all of the comments on the reviews about the elevators were overstated. There are three elevators and it wasnt that bad, just get on the elevator when you see it (even if its the wrong direction). Its much easier going up than going down, they are heavily weighted towards the lobby and ground floors. The room is small but most are in New York. It wasnt cramped and there was enough space. The bed and furnshings were quite nice and comfortable. The room was clean when we started and cleaned well each day. My biggest complaint was the noise from our neighbors, not necessarily a mark on the hotel but we could hear everything. We stayed for five nights. Our first two nights the couple next door was loud and obnoxious and smoked one of the nights. When we called the front desk security promptly came and checked on the room. Our last two nights our neighbor made a business phone call at 5:30 in the morning, which we heard every word of. Street noise was minimal. The walls were very thin. The location wasnt too bad, its near the ferry to Ellis Island and statue of liberty as well as the 911 memorial and the stock exchange but most major landmarks are uptown. Its near three or four different subway stops that are good avenues for getting around the city. The free cookies were a nice gesture although sort of commonplace around the country nowadays.

Our connecting king rooms were quite tight (normal for Manhattan) but were laid out in a nice configuration. The bedding consisted of the updated Hilton sheets which were very comfortable. The furniture and the room were all very clean and sported a very modern zen-like feel. The bathrooms were very clean and modern looking. The water pressure was strong and showers felt great. All the usual toiletries were included, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. I had 2 slight issues with the hotel rooms. The HVAC was not as quiet as it could be and all the ice machines were out of commission during my stay forcing me to ask the connected restaurant for my cubes. (They said there was some defect in all the machines - hopefully this will be resolved soon) The morning breakfast (included as a Hilton Diamond) was average for a Doubletree.

That was a bummer, but there was nothing we could do about it. Just keep that in mind if you use Priceline for NYC hotels (this has happened before to us but only in NYC). Upon arriving, we found a parking garage right across the street from the hotel that was about $15 cheaper than valeting so we were happy about that. The lobby is really nice with lots of plush couches. At check-in, they gave each us a warm cookie which was SO good. Such a nice welcoming gift :) We got a room on the 43rd floor which had a great view of the new tower being built near Ground Zero. We were really pleased with that as we got some great photos.

The financial district is very quiet during the weekends which was nice. We felt safe and got a good nights sleep on the comfy beds.

The hotel is in the Financial District, so is away from the hustle and bustle of Midtown. On the weekend this area was very quiet. The hotel is in a great spot, with the red and yellow subway lines just 2 or 3 minutes walk, and the green line not much further. It is also 5 minutes walk from the Staten Island Ferry, and just across the road from Battery Park. I used my position at this hotel to walk around some areas of NYC I hadn't explored before. The museum of Jewish History is a 10 minute walk, and the World Trade Centre Memorial maybe 15-20 minute walk. The hotel itself is nothing much to look at from the outside, but inside I found it to be clean, and very nice overall. The check-in desks are on the 2nd floor, which is kind of a pain, because you have to catch the elevator 1 floor up and then get off, and then get the elevator again to your room. All staff I encountered were very friendly - the girl who checked me in was especially friendly. On the weekends they give out warm chocolate chip cookies on check-in which was nice, and they gave us an extra one when we came back in at midnight when we asked for one! They were really yummy! Our room was on the 6th floor. We didn't have a view of anything other than the building behind us, but for the price we paid ($115 for one night, including taxes) I wasn't really looking for a view - just a clean place to stay. The room was small, but for NYC standards it was average sized, I'd stay. The king bed was AMAZINGLY comfortable, and they provided 5 pillows of differing firmness which I liked. Bathroom was clean and modern. Other people have complained of it being too small, but I'm not sure what they want to do in their other than shower! It was perfectly fine, however we had to call down to reception for a box of Kleenex as they did not have any in the bathroom. We didn't eat at the hotel as it was rather expensive. There is an Au Bon Pain 2 minutes walk, and also a Duane Reed around the corner. The only thing that blemished our stay at this hotel was that the housekeeping staff were very loud, and barged into our room not once, but 5 times between 9am (when they woke us) and 11:30am (check out was noon). I thought after the first time they would leave us alone, but they kept coming back. It turned out that our \"do not disturb\" sign has fallen onto the floor, but as well as the constant barging into our room, they also yelled loudly in the hallways outside our door, and constantly slammed the doors of the rooms they were cleaning. I found this to be rude and wasn't very pleased with it on a Sunday morning when I wanted to be able to sleep in a little.

The lifts only caused us an issue one morning, and this was when one lift was out of service, so understandable. Our biggest gripe about the hotel was the breakfast room was far too small for the number of guests trying to use it, resulting in a queue to be seated in a hallway near the bell desk that was too small. I would suggest they don't sell breakfast inclusive rooms, as the facilities cannot accommodate it - that said the breakfast we had there was very good, and the staff did their best with the size of restaurant they had to work with. Checkin / out was very easy, and the bell guy helped us take the hotel dab to the airport which was convenient. close to subway, walking distance to staten island ferry, good restaurants and bars close by the hotel, Duane Reid convenience shop and murphys bar are right next door. all in all, the good far outweighed the bad, and we would happily stay here again, and would highly recommend it. don't buy the breakfast if you are in a rush, and allow time for the lifts just in case.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paignton", "Title": "\u201cSatisfactory hotel in good location\u201d", "Author": "ajhodges0", "ReviewID": "UR122704216", "Content": "Stayed here for twixmas between 26th and 30th December.

I was never sufficiently tempted to try the hotel restaurant which generally seemed mildly expensive and quiet. Breakfast was not included in the deal I got from the hotel. Hotel room seemed an unremarkable 4* city hotel room. The bed seemed shorter than I would have liked and I am not that tall at 5' 10\". The major issue with the hotel is the elevators or rather the lack of them. I find it difficult to conceive the building was designed as a 44 floor hotel with just three elevators in total and wonder if it was originally intended to be a hotel when it was built. My waiting times varied from nothing late at night to six minutes at peak times and this during a period the hotel was presumably not that full. On my last day one elevator malfunctioned bringing the number of working elevators to two and I later overheard another guest loudly complaining to the Manager regarding the elevators, which I suspected was not that unusual. Also reception is on the second floor and I found late at night that anyone can walk in off the street and use the elevators since late at night there were often no staff in the lobby, which seems to be something of a security issue. My last day alarm call failed to materialise but service was otherwise okay. Finally if you are going to visit midtown a lot as I found I was, the 15-20 min subway journey begins to tire and is not ideal, particularly at night.

My husband and I recently stayed there and came back to the hotel one night at about 11:00 pm to find the entrance blocked by a group of 50 German tourists waiting to take the ONE working elevator to the reception area on the second floor. There was no way for us to get to our room on the 40th floor without walking up the stairs (or waiting about an hour in a very small doorway behind the tourist group until an elevator was free). The German tourists weren't any happier. This was an inexcusable inconvenience but one I was somewhat prepared for since I had read the reviews on tripadvisor. When my husband and I finally got to our floor (yes, we walked up 40 flights), we entered the room to find it had not been cleaned even though we had been gone all day (from 11 am). I called reception for someone to come clean our room and was told it was impossible to have someone clean it until tomorrow because the cleaning staff went home. So I asked if I could have some towels so we could take showers before going to bed. And they said yes but it would take awhile since there was a crowd in the entrance and only one elevator working. So then I demanded a refund for the room but was told that they couldn't do anything until the housekeeping manager checked with the cleaning woman in the morning to find out why she didn't clean the room. The staff overall were very nice and helpful but it seems they are operating under rules and conditions that make it very difficult for them to ensure customers receive the service they deserve.

While I am not stating that she should have done as I wished, her job was to at least hear me out and offer solutions or follow up by her managers. In all honesty, I cannot remember when is the last time I was treated this poorly by a manager, especially that it was quite easy to track her down as this was not the call center. I did finally get a call back from an assistant general manager after I called twice. He was polite and did hear me out, did not exactly address the original issue but did offer me breakfast. The rest of the staff while dining and checking in was very nice and pleasant. I unfortunately had to stay another time in a few days as this hotel is very convenient to my office and the rate was fine. The room in and of itself was very clean, well set up, and the view of the river was superb. It was nice to relax in the morning and look outside. The overall hotel is space challenged as many NY hotels are, so the hotel lobby is actually yon the 2nd floor. This hotel has 44 floors and only 3 elevators. Trust me that this is an issue. If you know you have to be somewhere on time, add from 5 to 10 minutes just to get on the elevator. If you are on the top floors you ride down is not too bad since you get on first, but if you are anywhere below the 30th floor, you may have to let many elevators pass you in order to get out of the hotel. Additionally, the restaurant for breakfast while a buffet, I cannot believe people would pay $18 to eat this as it is basically oatmeal, potatoes, eggs and bacon. It was good, but extremely cramped and you basically had to stand over people whose chairs were right by the buffet. I know the place is small, but the set up will need to be rethought.

There was never a time when we did not have to spend an inordinate period of time waiting for an elevator. Fortunately we were on the 5th floor and could use the steps, but my hubby was suffering from a sore foot and this was a painful experience. Additionally the hotel service personnel are forced to use the same 3 elevators, which further burdens the already over-stressed system. The rooms are well appointed and clean, but we actually ran out of toilet paper and asked the maid working in the next room for some. She responded that she would get us some, but half-hour later when we asked again, she went to the supply cabinet and reported that she was out of toilet paper and would have someone send us some up. Fortunately we did have tissues in the room. But 4 hours later when no toilet paper had arrived, I called the desk asking if I had to go out and buy my own. They apologized and promptly hustled 2 precious rolls up from the main supply. The final straw was the group of young girls in the adjoining room (our room had a connecting door to the room next door) who woke us at 4:15 a.m. with loud shrieks, laughs and claps. Finally, after 15 minutes of partying, my hubby knocked on their door and asked them to quiet down. They did for about 5 minutes, but then reverted back to their previous behavior. I had no idea that you could hear noise from the adjacent room so clearly through a closed connecting door, but we could actually hear every word of their conversation in addition to the vomiting of one of the girls. This was followed by traffic back and forth in the hallway and hotel room doors slamming as they must have had additional friends in other rooms on the floor. Apparently others were awakened by this wee-hour partying and I believe that the hotel staff took control of the situation by sending someone up after an hour of this nonsense, as we heard no more from them after that!!

The Welcome Cookie was absolutely delicious, a big, chewy chocolate chip affair.... The room was small, but stylish. It was very clean, permanently non-smoking, no cleaning solvent odors either. Some effort has been made to be a little \"greener\" than a lot of hotels -- there were recycling bins for bottles and cans; the toilet had the Little Flush button and the Big Flush button.... The bed was definitely King-size in width, but it was only standard in length....necessary, I think, given how narrow the room was. But the mattress was perfect in terms of firmness; there were lots of pillows; and the linens were downright luxurious. There was a very plump mattress pad, high thread-count sheets, and TWO king-size down comforters....we only needed one in the event. I could happily have stayed in bed for days..... The narrowness of the room meant that the TV on the wall opposite the bed was fairly close....great for watching from bed! The coffee machine (Wolfgang Puck) actually worked; made two cups of decent coffee at once, and there was real half-and-half to put in it....though there needed to be quite a bit more of that..... The take-out food from the Mexican restaurant across the street was inexpensive and delicious. The breakfast nook, on the other hand, left a lot to be desired. The light is cold and very, very gray. The food arrived not QUITE stone cold. The music, on a Sunday morning, was top-40, not at ALL what one wants to hear during breakfast, AND it was too loud. They were, however, still SERVING breakfast at something past noon, so that was good. The other main flaw was the lack of elevators. There were only two elevators for forty-some floors, which meant that you had to wait a long time for an elevator, and then, if you were on one of the lower floors trying to go down, probably you couldn't fit in when the door opened because it was chock-full of people who had gotten on higher up. Luckily, we were on the 32nd floor, so while we had to wait to get a down elevator, it was at least not full when the door opened. There were no Do Not Disturb signs for us to hang on the door handle of our room, and the next morning....Sunday.....Housekeeping knocked and knocked and called and called at 9:15 until I finally had to get out of bed and ask her to Go Away. Management should either give guests Do Not Disturb signs, or else not send Housekeeping until after check-out time, which was noon. All in all, though, I would go there again.....the neighborhood is very nice, and the Landmark Customs House with the Smithsonian Museum of American Indians in it is WELL worth visiting, over next to Battery Park....no entrance fee!

In NYC, it is not uncommon to wait 5-15 minutes for an elevator - you just need to be patient as this is the way it is in the big city.

My experience was interrupted by an uncomfortable and disconcerting incident; while my cousin and I were sleeping in the bed, we got bitten by something, most likely insects, all over our bodies. Specifically, I went to bed at around 11pm and after showering and getting into bed, my cousin was complaining of bug bites and itching, but we did not see anything in the bed, few hours later I awoke itchy and with bite marks on my arms, hands and legs. At that point, (3am) I told her to quickly get out of bed because there was something (potentially bed bugs, I assumed) biting us. I immediately went to the lobby to report my problem at which time they switched our room and told me return at 8:30am to speak with the manager. Without even focusing on the manager's skeptic and rude attitude towards me, I can just say that from here, I was offered no answers and min compensation. The manager had a inspection company come in the next day and inspect the room and told me that nothing was found. 'Nothing' does not bite 2 people in a hotel bed all over their bodies. No further explanation was offered and one can ponder whether or not a large corporate hotel would ever admit to having such a problem to a client. Regardless, if the Hilton mission statement is \"to fill the earth with the light and warmth of hospitality\" and that mission extends to the Doubletree brand, the financial district branch has fallen terribly short; instead they've produced emotional and psychological frustration and physical discomfort (in my case). Its not enough to tell a loyal and paying customer, 'we do not know why this has happened to you' and shrug your shoulders of the situation. As compensation, Manager Murnane offered me a complimentary night at the Doubletree (why would I want to stay in an environment where I do not feel safe or comfortable!) This situation that has left me feeling powerless and voiceless. I don't know why I went through the trouble of showing an employee and manager the bite marks, having documented the bite marks with photos, to subsequently be offered NO answers concerning the origin of the bites. It is disconcerting that they claimed to have had a professional come in and inspect the premises and yet have found NOTHING. Bug bites do not arise out of dust and I surely did not spend the extra bucks to stay at the Doubletree to have the sort of experience you would expect from Motel 8.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cNice newer hotel in financial district\u201d", "Author": "Laurancn", "ReviewID": "UR118025531", "Content": "Fairly new hotel on Stone Street in the financial district.

We showed up at 12h30pm and our room was ready, had to wait a few minutes at the lobby as there was only 1 staff member, but when the manager noticed 3 people standing & waiting to be served he came out from the office to help out. The lobby is on the second floor, TAKE THE STAIRS and walk up to check-in, park your car direclty across the street(mention you are staying @ hotel and they will honor the $35/day). We had NO problems with the elevators, most we ever waited was maybe 3-4 minutes. Breakfast was included with our room, it is a good breakfast Hot & Cold, bacon/pancakes/eggs/fruits/cereal/juice/coffee/danishes/croissant/yougurts/etc. I strongly recommend talking the breakfast option, a breakfast like this in any hotel in any city is easily +$20. The staff, friendly, accomodating, no 'attitude'..make you feel like they appreciate your business and you being there. One of the men working on the main floor actually ran to the street corner to get us a taxi! The best part of this hotel is it's location and here's why - NYC is C R A Z Y busy & noisy so when you get back from your day out visiting busy TimeSquare/Cental Park/Rockfeller Center or wherever else you can actually relax and unwind and let your mind rest from all the noise & activity of the city. Financial district during weekdays 8-6 is busy like everywhere else in NYC, if not more so - but after 6pm everyone goes home and on weekends it's quiet for 2 days :) Anothe BIG advantage of staying here, you walk 50m to the corner of the street and you have 2 subway stations. This is what we used to get around with our kids, we took the GREEN number 4 to Grand Central Station/Time Square/ Yankee Stadium. If you have any worries about taking the subway as I did, there is TRULY nothing to worry about - as mentioned we traveled with our 2 boys and not only was it safe and people VERY friendly & willing to help with directions, but the subway wagons are CLEAN!!! Th whole city acutally is pretty clean considering the number of people there...only rude people you will find are other tourists, go figure!

You are an asset to the hotel. As far as the elevators, it is clear to see, if you look on the map of the hotel, that they have as many elevators as possible given the layout of the hotel. We never had to wait more than a minute or two, not a big deal at all. I don't have a ton of patience either. For those complaining about the layout of the hotel (having to go through the restaurant?? Seriously, figure it out) You come through a bell stand area, the restaurant is to the right of it, through glass doors...it's not difficult to figure out.

We walked about 5 minutes to Battery Park to get the ferry to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, WTC Memorial was about 10 minute walk and the subway to get to Times Square was just 5 minutes away.

Immediately after booking (1 week before my arrival) I contacted the hotel to request one of my two rooms to have double beds. Anthony at the front desk told me they were \"almost 50% occupied\" and had \"plenty of doubles and even suites left.\" He needed me to contact Priceline with the request and have them fax over a request - which I did immediately. When it came time to check in, Sam informed me that the request was not granted and they are now out of double rooms. We also requested a refrigerator for one of the rooms (for medication), which was not mentioned anywhere in the reservation.

He also let me know that they do not have any other room types or rolling beds available. He also said he'd send the refrigerator up right away... and 5 hours later, it was not there.

The hotel was almost brand new when I stayed there and was in pristine condition. Overall I would give this hotel the highest ranking possible, however, if you have never stayed in New York City hotel before there are a few things that are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unique\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the experience. And I am not mentioning these things as a way of complaining, but mentioning them because they actually add to the ambiance of the hotel. First, there are only 3 elevators and 44 floors. So if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on a high floor make sure you leave a few minutes early because it will take you awhile to get to the lobby, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even busier on the weekends. And on each floor the hallways are very narrow so if you are traveling with equipment for work or large luggage it will be tricky navigating to your room. There is one restaurant on site, 8 Stone, which I only ate at once because it was slightly expensive and I get a daily per Diem for food. But the meal I had there was amazing and was completely worth the price so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not concerned about price you will find some delicious options here. STAFF: Before I arrived at the hotel I called ahead and asked if there was a mini-fridge in the room because I needed one as I travel with medication. I spoke to Michele who works the front desk and she said that none of the rooms have one but she would see what she could do for me. In no time I received an email confirmation that they did not have any on site but they would have another Hilton hotel send one over for me specifically. I have never had a Hilton staff member do something like that for me before. And on my second 9 night stay she upgraded me to one of the suites even though they only have 5 of them for no reason other then to be nice. But the most amazing thing that the front desk staff did for me for offer me a special unpublished rate which was considerably lower then when they could have gotten for the room. And by doing this I was able to stay in Manhattan for my entire time there and did not have to move over to a cheaper hotel in Brooklyn. With all honestly I can say that, as a whole, the staff at this Doubletree was the best I have ever come across. And I spend over 200 nights a year in Hiltons all across the country. With staying there as long as I did I eventually had everyone from the security officers and bell hops at the front door, to the maintenance staff, to the servers and manager in 8 Stone, to the general manager addressing me personally every single time I they saw me. I was always treated with the upmost respect and professionalism by 99% of the hotel staff. Unfortunately that does leave 1% of the staff, and that 1% is the front desk manager, Elvi. Of all the Hiltons I have stayed at and of all the employees I have come to know I have NEVER been treated as poorly as I was by Elvi. But Michael, the General Manager of the hotel, personally handled the situation to my full and complete satisfaction, so all I will say about that is try to avoid Elvi. But if you do need anything at all from the front desk make sure you find Michelle or Michael and you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ever be disappointed. And if you need anything from the restaurant make sure you find Joshua, the finest manager in all of New York City. ROOMS: The rooms are all standard and there are only a few suites. The rooms are very nicely decorated and the beds, pillows, and blankets are extremely comfortable. But the rooms are also pretty small and the bathroom and shower are really cramped. The suites are slightly larger and have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153living room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd area with a couch and second flat screen TV. But for New York City the rooms are on par with what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect to find so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a big deal if you keep that in mind. Your best bet is to get a high floor and try to get an \u00e2\u20ac\u015308\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room because they are shaped in a way where you get a little more space by the door and these are the biggest non-suite rooms they have. Also, the higher you get the less street noise you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear. Another nice little extra is that the window actually opens so you can let in fresh air as well as the sounds of the city if you want them. And two other small little things that frequent travelers will appreciate is that the hotel offers a large amount of TV channels and multiple HBOs and the best part is that the TV actually has a guide that you can bring up and scroll through to find what you want to watch and not waste an hour surfing every channel looking for something to watch. And finally, keep in mind that unlike most Doubletree Hotels there are no mini-fridges or microwaves standard in the rooms. But I was told that the hotel does now keep a few on hand in case someone requests one\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so you can thank me for that later! AREA: What else can you say but WOW! Walk out the front door and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be in front of the NY Stock Exchange, or the Wall Street Charging Bull, or Battery Park, or the Staten Island Ferry in 3-4 minutes at the most. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also less then 10 minutes away from the World Trade Center site and the South Street Seaport. There are two subway lines nearby, one on the corner and one over in Battery Park that will get you anywhere in the city you need to go. You can be in Times Square in 12 minutes flat. The only negatives are the Pubs near Wall Street are very popular and thus, very busy and very expensive. There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a lot of quality reasonably priced places to eat beyond these within walking distance. So your best bet is to get an unlimited subway card and head north. But the one Saving Grace is that Lombardi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually delivers to the hotel and it gets there super fast and super hot and fresh, but they only take cash. ELITE BENEFITS: The biggest benefit is the free breakfast buffet down in 8 Stone for elite members. The buffet isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad but it also isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t amazing. They offer fresh fruit, eggs, pancakes, meats, breads, and cereals. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great for shorter stays but when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re there for 9 straight mornings at a time and over 50 mornings in all anything would start to get boring. Juice is free but soda is not and neither are the refills. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also get free wireless in your room which always worked well for me. WOULD I STAY AGAIN OR RECOMMEND: 100% YES! You will find that for its location this is going to be one of the most affordable brand names in New York City. The staff is AMAZING and the hotel is beautiful.

Disappointing that Hilton has chosen not to extend the usual \"free wi-fi\" courtesy that is normally found in the Doubletree family. While the business lounge offers free access, it would have been much more convenient had it been included in the room rate.

It doesn't give the reader a fair overview of the hotel. So, let me tell you all about the good of the hotel and then I will give my one complaint at the end. Rooms: Small, but laid out well and comfortable. Stylishly decorated. Big window. Modern bathroom with GREAT shower. Extremely comfy beds. Overall Great! Reception: Very friendly, eager to please. Great warm chocolate chip cookies at check in. Location: To each their own, but we loved it. We come to NY every year and we know our way around very well. We love downtown versus times square area. 2 subway stations within a 60 second walk. 4/5 lines and the R line with the 1 line. Make sure to walk down to 62 Stone Street (same street) to Financier Patisserie for breakfast or afternoon snack. It's a French-style cafe. Here goes for my one complaint: On the AM of us leaving, I called Reception and asked for a \"cab\" to the airport. They said \"sure, we will call one for you, when do you need it\"....So, we get down to the street and this nice SUV is waiting. I knew right away they had called a \"limo\" service. I was told by the driver that it was $50 flat fee to LGA airport. Would have been only about $20-25 with a metered cab. By that point, we didn't have time to do anything else. Had to take the limo to make our plane on time. It would have been very nice for the hotel to tell us about the fee for the limo before ordering it. Especially since he only took cash, thank goodness we had enough cash on us. (versus metered cabs who take cards)......to make it worse, found out later that the hotel gets a $20 cut on EVERY limo car they call for a customer. That made my blood boil............Just warning others for future visits. Now I know for next time! :) You live and learn....... I would stay here again despite the limo incident.

The corridors are very small, cramped and I was constantly woken by doors slamming, people talking loudly and antisocial behaviour. Having gone to sleep at about 10 I was woken by noisy guests coming in and out of the lift. This lasted for about half an hour and then I drifted back to sleep only to be woken again by more people and noise in the corridor. I eventually opened the door to find a small group of people lying drunk by the emergency exits. I called security who eventually came but the group had left. Same thing happened 15 mins later and by this time I was fully awake. Security was called again and dealt with the issue.

Starting from the beginning, I have been visiting New York on business for the last 10 years and was keen to try this new hotel in the financial district having stayed at all the other local hotels. The Doubletree's location is good and, being on the first part of Stone Street means it does not suffer undue street noise. Also on the positive side was the size and quality of the shower in the bathroom (NB there are no baths) and the wide choice of TV Channels in the bedroom, all of which could be viewed clearly without interference. Like other nearby hotels, it was clean and the bed was comfortable. Turning to the not so positives, the hotel is over 44 floors and has nearly 400 bedrooms. However, they are served by only three (fairly slow) lifts which could be very frustrating at peak times once the hotel gets booked up. Downstairs, the ground restaurant has little ambience and is only rated for 55 seated of which around ten would be in a conservatory off of the restaurant. The latter also doubled as the area where the breakfast buffet was laid out. With sub-zero temperatures outside, this area was very cold indeed at breakfast time. The bar and restaurant area is also far smaller than the nearby Marriott, Andaz and Millenium Hilton hotels. Moving up the building, I was staying with a number of colleagues on different floors. From our collective experience, on the lower floors, the communal hallway areas were cold with the hotel warming up the higher you went. However, this benefit in heat was offset by an increase in extraction noise via a vent in the ceiling of the bathrooms from the communal building ventilation system. A number of colleagues closed their bathroom doors at night which cured the noise but also meant the bathroom was then not heated (all heating is supplied by a single wall mounted fan under the window of the bedroom). Basically a choice between noise and comfort. For a hotel of this price in the financial district, it is also very unusual to have wall mounted fan heaters at all. Normally, it is via ducted heating/AC in the bedrooms. As a consequence, in cold weather (and presumably the reverse also being true for AC in the summer), your sleep is disturbed by the fan switching on and off to maintain temperature. Being a relatively light sleeper, I switched mine off at night which resulted in a cold start to the day. The bedrooms are the smallest I have stayed in locally which would not necessarily be a problem if the tariff was substantially less than the other hotels listed above. However, when we booked, it was comparable which, for us would be a deciding factor in looking to book again. Overall, I would suggest only going for this hotel if the tariff quoted gives a good saving over and above the Downtown Marriot or the Andaz on Wall/Water Street.", "Date": "January 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida", "Title": "\u201cTop Marks- Great Hotel\u201d", "Author": "jdhammer", "ReviewID": "UR94511525", "Content": "I stayed for 4 nights for business.
