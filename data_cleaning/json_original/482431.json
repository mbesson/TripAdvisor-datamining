All I had to do was hold the shower to the mould and it came away, so i'm unsure why it hadn't been cleaned. 5) Our 'ensuite' bathroom had a shower and sink only - no toilet!

All of the things that happened in all the other Negative reviews also happened to us! Made us move to Rubinos Hotel which is also a DUMP! Dirty with mold all over the bathroom and I am talking about both Hotels. I wish I had of read all of these other reviews here before booking! They made us move the first night to Rubinos after we took all our bags up the tiny elevator in 3 trips then back down in the rain to walk a block to Rubinos and another 3 trips up that elevator. I complained all the way to no avail. The next day I went and told them to put us in Blu because that was what we booked and they said the manager would be at Planet so had to go there. Was told that they would try to fix it by the maid as manager was not around. Come back in 30 minutes went back and said ok you can move back but then the manager wanted to be apologetic but I said that was bait and switch and I had not even seen the inside of the Blu rooms which I thought would be better---oops I was wrong. He was very rude and did not want to listen to my complaints instead got in a huff and walked away! I did not even get to the part about the MOLD on the bathroom walls which affected my daughters breathing in the night. She slept with the bathroom door shut and no one took a shower because Rubinos was terrible! The Blu rooms were a little better but still NO 2 star maybe 0 star and that is a stretch. Well I could keep complaining but I feel I have said enough so you know to NEVER EVER STAY in this DUMP or you will be SORRY and Unhappy with your trip to Rome. The only reason we disliked Rome was all because of this Hotel. The trip to Florence then Venice and back was fantastic but Rome Sucked all because I book rooms at the S. Blu.

Firstly, value and cleandliness were very good, the cost was 80 euros for a double room per night with breakfast included, and we could check in from 10am - ideal when arriving off early morning ryan air flights! On arrival at the hotel I was surprised to find it was in a building which housed several other hotels - each occupying a seperate floor. I had checked with the hotel if it was accessable (I am a wheelchair user but dont need an adapted room as I can stand and manage a few steps with a walking stick) and was assured that there was a room that would accomodate my needs, and as rooms were small, I could leave my wheelchair at reception so as not to clutter room with it, which I thought was kind and helpful, I was also reassured there was a lift - which there was, however it was accessed after first climbing up 3 steep steps. On arrival at the hotel, we buzzed the doorbell and the maid let us in after only a minute, after another minute we were checked in and given our room. The room was right next to the reception and was small with an extremely small bathroom - the whole thing toilet and shower as sink unit was 1 yard square, however I could sit on loo and shower at same time! The bed linen was clean an crisp and the room was clean, with tv which had an english speaking, american news channel - cnn I think, but not sure. The room being next to reception was very noisy, and after 10pm we needed to use our keys to enter as reception does not work, so after this time it was noiser still, as people arrived with no concern for sleeping guests, so if you do consider going to this hotel, ask for another room if given the one next to reception. Breakfast was taken at a little bar on the corner of the street, however on first morning we slept in till 10am so missed breakfast, and on next morning we could not actually access the bar with the wheelchair and were asked to leave me outside, while my husband went in an ate breakfast stood at bar then brough some out for me, needless to say this option was not taken up and we had a lovely roll and coffee at the station, just round corner and accross road. On the third day we left before breakfast bar opened, so I cannot make any comments on food or breakfast except to say they were not accomodating, wether that was because they had already seen the vouchers the hotel issue to exchange for breakfast, so knew we were not paying customers I do not know but suspect they may have helped more if they thought there was cash at stake. The hotel arranged our transfere back to the airport for us, and helped us down with bags at 7am. All in all it is a good location, clean and basic hotel (more of an old B&B than a hotel) but good value, I would recommend it if you were not a wheelchair user and looking for a bargain place to crash near the transport network. If you are looking for a nice place to have a break, look somewhere else or you may be a tad disappointed.", "Date": "June 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "US", "Title": "\u201cDo not stay at this 'hotel' !!!!\u201d", "Author": "ineedtotravelmore", "ReviewID": "UR30836354", "Content": "#1 Do not confuse Hotel Soggiorno Blu on Via Magenta with Hotel Blu Roma. #2 The hotel is located in a 'scary' part of Rome, but is very close to the train station, it's only good quality.

We were then notified that we were being moved to Hotel Planet. #3 Hotel Blu is affiliated with 5 other 2 star or lower hotels and will move you wherever they choose after you check in! #4 Hotel Planet was dirty, and by dirty, I mean other people's hair in the shower and their leftover soap. I actually had to ask for soap and towels. #5 The view from the room was of an alleyway. There is a no smoking policy because if the hotel were to ever catch on fire, you would never get out! #6 The staff was hard to find, once found extremely rude and unhelpful.

You get a token for a local cafe to get your breakfast which consists of a cup of coffee or orange juice and a pastry. This hotel is very basic and I had read a couple of reviews on it before I went. Being asked for payment on arrival before seeing the room, being asked to move to another hotel, not the Soggiorno Blu, obviously the other hotel(s) Hotel Planet being one of the hotels run by the same receptionist! So a delay in service at the desk. Internet is not free, you have to go to Hotel Planet to get access to the internet and it costs 5 Euros. The area is noisy and dirty and the rooms facing onto the \"courtyard\" are quieter but you have the bottles being emptied early in the morning and the waiters from nearby restaurants shouting at night! Your view consists of various makes of air conditioning fans! My experience was as I expected however on my return home the treatment I received from the manager is explained below. Economic should not reflect poor service and being asked to pay cash on arrival abruptly was off putting to start with but I had read on Trip Advisor this would happen, despite the hotel advertising they take cards. When the receptionist put my card through, I later found out since arriving home that it was to test the card and they deducted the price of the room and then added it back on however with the difference in exchange rates I am now \u00a322 down. I have been assured by the hotel manager this will be put back onto my account within the next 15 days but the correspondence I have had from him, Fabio Alvisini, is the most arrogant, rude and abrasive I have ever come across. To treat your customers in the manner he has is quite unbelievable, I am flabbergasted! I would not recommend this hotel to anybody as the treatment of their customers is absolutely despicable. The hotel was clean enough but being on my honeymoon I wanted a double bed and got two single beds pushed together! We had to ask for clean towels after two days use also I would not recommend this hotel to anybody. There are other cheap hotels in Rome which will give you far better service.

It is run by Hotel Planet who own a handful of other hotels in Termini Station area and all are as useless as each other. We arrived at Blu and were told we needed to move to the other building to complete check-in (they expect payment on arrival). When we settled into our room we realised we weren't in Blu at all but Hotel Rubino (the receptionist actually deceived us). The room itself was adequate and it had a phone but the bathroom was horrible. The toilet didn't have a seat and the shower was filthy. Furthermore we were too scared to turn on the heater for fear the inch-thick dust inside would catch fire. Before I complained I did a quick internet search and found that not only did Rubino have horrible reviews (whereas Blu's, at the time of booking at least, were adequate) but it had a special deal going for less than what we'd paid! I complained and the next morning we were moved to Blu and put in a family room (which apparently was an upgrade). It was similar in style to Rubino without a phone but with an adequate bathroom. I also made several complaints to different staff about the first night spent in Rubino, requesting compensation but no-one had the decency to get back to me (nor did they even bother to leave a note for the management, they want your money and then couldn't care less how your stay is). I strongly recommend against staying at any Hotel Planet hotel and if you do, make sure they put you in the hotel you book. If we were aware beforehand that this was run by the same people than run Hotel Rubino there is no way we would have stayed here.
