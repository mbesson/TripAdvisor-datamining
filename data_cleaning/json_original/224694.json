Upon our arrival...which was late evening we were greeted by a very pleasant young man. He was very attentive and was very helpful in completeing our check in quickly. It had been an extremely long day for us, flying from the East Coast, so we were very grateful. The room we had was a suite with a kitchen, living room, separate bedroom and washroom. The room was nice, but I have to say, the discription on the actual Greenbrier site made us believe it would be much nicer. The room was freshly painted, clean, and did not have that stale cigarette smell that so many have, the bedding was clean and new, and the washroom had enough towels. The location was perfect for someone that likes to walk or take the Hop On Hop Off bus, which has a stop a few feet from the hotel on the opposite side of the street. A definite recommendation to get a great overview of this massive city. We walked to Stanley Park and rented bicycles just outside the entrance. One of the highlights of our trip. We both highly recommend doing this, as Vancouver is bicycle and tourist friendly . During our stay at the Greenbrier we did have a few complaints. The toilet was not shutting off and the shower curtain was stained and had black mold on the bottom. We let the front desk staff know the next morning before we left for the day and upon returning everything was fixed/and or replaced. The room did not have air conditioning but we could open the windows to let in fresh air. The problem with that was the vicinity of the room to the street below. We could hear the street traffic as well as peoples voices as they were walking by. For some reason late at night, people were standing on the street below our window talking, not sure if it was a spot that people would go to have a cigarette but we did have to close the windows each night because of the voices, not so much the road noise. The best location for a room we belive would be at the back end of the hotel or the side facing uphill, which would be the right side of the hallways. (Our room number was 209) Breakfast is served in the morning...contintenal breakfast and evening coffee and cookies. The muffins are rather dry and stale, so we had our own breakfast in our room. We did not have any bowls or utensils,so we asked the front desk staff and it was provided without any problem. We bought our breakfast foods at the Safeway grocery store that is just down the street on the opposite side. We would recommend this hotel due to the friendliness of the staff, location and price. .", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middleburg, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cNot as Advertised\u201d", "Author": "traveler20482048", "ReviewID": "UR116220308", "Content": "This hotel is not chic,boutique nor does it have designer furniture.

My husband and I shared a 1BR suite with another couple & their teenage son. First the good: Room was recently renovated with new flooring, paint, windows, drapes, & bedding. It is located in the middle of action on Robson Street and a leisurely walk from Stanley Park. The price was good at $222 CAD per night for a 2 room suite for all 5 of us (very large living room/kitchen area & average size bedroom). The room was clean upon check in. Now the bad: Claimed they couldn't find our reservation (even though a $500 \"hold\" had been placed on my friend's credit card & a $300 \"hold\" had been placed on my credit card (both were a deposit against \"damages\"). After over an hour of wrangling on my friend's part, they finally let us check in. The room looks nice when you first walk in, then you start to notice little oddities such as: no A/C or heat or even a thermostat to look at. The windows all open (thank goodness), but they have no screens & have bars on both sides of the windows. The suite comes with a full kitchen, but there were only 2 plates & 2 small juice glasses (for a suite that holds up to 6 people) and NO utensils or pots & pans of any kind. There was a small stove, with a small sign on it saying that the stove is out of order, but if you want a microwave oven you can check with the front desk & they will bring you one (why not just have one available in the room to start with?). The closet in the bedroom has no doors on it and no hangers in it. The beds are listed on their website as being 2 queen size beds, when in reality, they are only double beds (main reason we had stayed here, over another place, was for the queen size beds). There is a small coat closet in the living room, with the type of hangers that have a ring permanently attached to the bar, and the hanger comes off with just a little metal bar at the top. When you try to hang something up, the hanger doesn't fit back in the closet without holding it sideways as you find the hanger is wider than the closet is, front to back. I could go on... Lots of little annoying things that added up to an annoying visit. One last note, the morning of our second day there, a lady was at the front desk, crying, because her credit cards came up missing out of her purse, which she had left in her room.

First, we could tell it's an old building. There are signs of deterioration in the room. The bathroom especially shows rusty water pipes. The shower handle keeps falling off. I've asked for someone to fix it and they sent somebody right away. The bathroom sink doesn't looked like cleaned before we checked in. I went to the store to buy sanitizing wipes. I realized now that they could offer a low rate because this hotel is almost to the bare bones. There's no a/c; but they provided fans but not enough to cool the room. We opened the windows at night but we could hear the noise from the street. They provided one tiny, I mean, tiny trash can in the bathroom. I have to use my plastic bags to put in our trash. I've asked for a box of tissue and they said they don't provide it. The toilet paper in the bathroom is of the cheapest kind (am sure nobody would like to use it). The beds were in terrible shape; including the beddings. There's a small refrigerator in the room, which is a plus, but they stocked it with their own drinks for sale. Overall, I give credit to the friendly and courteous staff but totally disappointed with the condition of the room. It's time that they consider major renovation in the immediate future.", "Date": "September 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cGreat clean place to stay\u201d", "Author": "waho", "ReviewID": "UR5726859", "Content": "We have just returned from The Greenbrier Hotel, located in Vancouver on Robson St. We called the property directly and were given a far cheaper price than offered on Expedia, or travelocity.

What a GREAT spot (at a GREAT price) for taking in the city. The Ritz Carleton it is not, but it served the needs of four young doctors looking for clean and close to everything. It was just perfect and we had a wonderful time there. The best parts: 1. The hotel itself: Desk guys have their own quirky, slightly goofy, and helpful charm. Mathew, the manager, is frequently around and available, and VERY nice. Each suite has either one or two double beds, a comfy little living area with a couch and cable TV (and ours in room 106 had the most AMAZING view down to the water and north to the mountains!), and a kitchen with fully functional appliances, cutlery, etc. The bathroom was clean and served the purpose. 2. The neighbourhood: a five minute walk to EVERYTHING from Capers (the organic grocery store) to Stanley Park to Miso (this AWESOME sushi restaurant) to the fine SHOPPING of Robson street. Lululemon, Banana Republic, Esprit, the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, M.A.C., and others are within spitting distance. Ten or fifteen minutes on foot in one direction lands you in Yaletown, and in the other direction lands you in that downtown area overlooking the bay. Things to be aware of: - The guys at the desk are a hoot, really, but be prepared to be self directed. They have lots of touristy brouchures not a lot of advice about how to find things or get places, eg with public transit. Fortunately, pretty much every second person on the street or in any shop can tell you how to get wherever you want to go. There are detailed tourism brochures everywhere. - Some of the first floor rooms (I think the odd numbers, eg 103, 105) are on the side of the building against a parking lot and so the windows are barred and a little lacking in view. I'd avoid them if possible. All in all, the Greenbriar comes HIGHLY recommended.
