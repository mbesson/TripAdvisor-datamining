I realised this was not a central hotel and we planned accordingly. Our taxi from the airport dropped us late at night at the rather unnattractive street entrance (refuse bins and a forbidding iron gate) but we climbed the steps to the next level to find the front door. As it was so late we could not get anything to eat either at the hotel or anywhere around it, despite the best efforts of the reception staff. Things looked up in the morning; we took the free shuttle bus to the metro and went about the city from there. We returned to the hotel exhausted from sightseeing on both days, not wanting to venture out again. This meant we ate there on two nights. The first was Sunday and they had been entertaining a children's party all afternoon, so I think the staff were pretty frazzled when it came to dinner service. The menu was rather limited and a couple of things had run out, so choice was not great; my wife's ham salad was very disappointing. But what a contrast on the next night; we had a very pleasant meal of chateaubriand. Breakfasts on all three mornings were excellent with plenty of choice, the scrambled egg was superb. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout. I agree with another reviewer the bedrooms were rather dated but spotlessly clean and a comfortable bed. All in all, it was a great base for our stay and much better value than any more central hotels I have previously used.

An added bonus was the balcony with views across Rome (althought not really the panorama of St Peters as implied) and also a complimentary bottle of red wine from the hotel manager. The room also had a bath with shower and the room had a sofa and a mini bar too. The staff were friendly and helpful throughout and lent us a travel adaptor when requested and booked us a seat on their shuttle bus into central Rome on one of the mornings, although we walked most of the time. The walk is not for the faint hearted as it's probably 30mins from Roma centre and an uphill climb back at the end of a long day. The hotel is near a bus route but we didnt manage to get organised enough to take the bus and always just opted to walk it, with regret once half way home...

The evening meals are limited in range, but impressive in quality - the steaks in particular are exceptional, and I've heard good things about the prawns. (Translation hints: \"green peppers\" = peppercorns, \"red peppers\" = chilli.) Rooms vary in size and whether they have access to a balcony and a view, but beds are large and comfortable and the plumbing works well. Television small (30cm?) but why come to Rome to watch TV? Soundproofing effective. Wifi works well for e-mail and browsing, wouldn't suggest trying to stream any entertainment. Located in a quiet residential area on a hill above the centre. Walking to and from the centre is quite practical if you're fit - I've done it several times - but the free minibus works well if you book it the day before (don't forget to book the return trip if you need it), and there are several frequent public bus routes into the city within 10 minutes walk - learn how to use them.

They helped us a lot, especially when it came to items we needed. We forgot a toothbrush and they provided us with some, and same thing with packing tape. They are very kind and welcoming. The dining was pretty good, and the prices were very affordable. The restaurant is quite helpful if you just came back from a long trip, and you don't want to look for food. Breakfast is complete, filling, and has great variety, with many Italian and even some American foods. It is far from traffic areas, making it quiet. The shuttle makes the location factor less of a big deal. The rooms were very clean, and the maids do a great job cleaning it up. Free wi-fi, but slow. Cons: It's location is far from the City Center, and many attractions, however, every morning you can book a free shuttle (7:30, 8:30, 9:30, 10:30) that takes you to the Metro station or the Vatican (Piazza Risogimento which is close to the museum and St. Peter's Basilica). No swimming pool, but it's Rome, and you probably won't go to swim anyways. The food takes a long time to make. TV is small. Those, however, are minor problems. I was very satisfied with the hotel, and for the money, I think it's one of the best hotels you could get for that price, considering the fact that many of the better hotels are priced at $250. Great hotel, great people, great food, great value. By the way, when you book, book on their website, because you don't have to pay the tax. Also, I heard their getting a swimming pool and possibly tennis courts and mini-soccer fields.

The service and food was so good, why would we go anywhere else? The location was just outside the city center. They do provide a shuttle to the Vatican Center which was nice.

We don't mind walk a few miles, but we do prefer to do that in the city centre. There is a bus stop not to far away, but for us it took to long to find out about it. So the Hotel shuttle bus was an option. We used it every day. I guess we could stay at this hotel again, that due to the low price.

It was hard to find a decent place to eat within walking distance at night and taxi drivers had to use sat-nav all the time to locate the hotel.Tip....always carry the address and postcode or taxi drivers dont have a clue. The shuttle bus in the morning is handy but I feel that a service throughout the day would be a bonus - the last one left the hotel at 10.10 which was fine until the day we were checking out and wanted to stay in room later. Also an English speaking TV channel would be appreciated.

The hotel is somewhat out of the way - the bus stop for the city bus is about 10 minutes' walk and it takes another 15 to get to the Vatican, or another 25-30 to get downtown - it is still a very good deal. A weekly bus pass costs about $25, much less than the difference in price between this hotel and others of comparable quality. The service is great, the staff is helpful and the rooms are clean. The breakfast is excellent: there is a huge selection and it makes the hotel an outstanding value. The head of the breakfast team, Mr. Gennaro, requires special mention. Because of jetlag we overslept and only went downstairs at noon. As soon as he heard about it, he treated the four of us to a full breakfast.
