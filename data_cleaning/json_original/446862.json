I felt extremly bad for waking him up at that time but he had a smile the whole time. The hotel has a great location. Walking distance to Sultanahmet Square and many shops and restaurants. If you ask for advice on dinner they immedietly recommend the restaurant next door to them- Divnine. they probably have an agreement with the owner, but its definitely worth going.

Some of their advice was inconsistent and later found to be incorrect so if you are looking for concierge service this is not the place to look. Additionally, the hotel continually smelled like cigarette smoke in the hallways and they did not initiate any leadership in order to fix this problem. Terribles: Despite confirming the reservation by address by email and phone the week prior, when we arrived they tried to tell us that our reservation was with their sister hotel \"Seres\" down the street. They eventually got us into the Empire Palace the next day, but it was a terrible and disappointing experience that they would try to exploit travelers this way and attempt to make them stay at a cheaper venue that doesn't hold a candle in quality to Empire Palace.

The hotel itself is located in the sultanahmet district of Istanbul. It was a little bit difficult to find since the sign at the facade is quite small. As there are tram rails next to the hotel the taxi couldn't stop at the entrace. But finally we managed to find it... The hotel itself is situated in the centre of the old town of Istanbul. All famous sights (Hagia Sophia, Blue mosque, Bazar ...) are within walking distance. Shopping options can be found in Taksim, where you can get by the tram running next to the hotel within 10 minutes. Around the hotel are enough opportunities to find something to eat, from a costly restaurant to a cheap snack bar. The hotel itself is very clean, also the spacious rooms. Water is provided free of charge every day. Breakfast can be taken at the 6th floor with a beautiful sight over the golden horn. The breakfast is the only thing there that can be criticised. The variation of food is very small, the tables are dirty and it doesn't seem to be noticed by the waiters. But for a short coffee and a small bread roll it is sufficient. The service itself (especially the concierge -> special thanks to Ergin here) is very good. The people are friendly and always there to help.

We were very pleased with the spaciousness of the room...traveling in Europe a great deal, the room's size was a WONDERFUL suprise and we were all very comfortable in our leisure time in the room. The breakfast in the morning was good and there was a variety of items to select...even cocopuffs for my VERY picky 3 year old...so all were happy!!! The outside \"patio/porch\" was a great way to end our evenings. My son and I had apple tea, while my husband enjoyed a beer and a waterpipe. The location was GREAT!!! We were able to walk to everything we wanted to see and then the things too far, the tram was right there and we just hopped on and off right around the corner. The noise was not an issue and the trams stopped running at midnight...even my 3 year old slept well!!! The beds were very comfortable, so we were able to get a GREAT night sleep each night, the first night, we were on the back of the hotel and heard the 5:30 call to prayer, but I was able to go right back to sleep...the rest of the time there, I never heard it from my room...which made me a little sad :(. The staff was INCREDIBLE!!!!!!! \"Ed\" at the desk and \"Q\" were FANTASTIC!!! They were very friendly, helpful, offered advise and set up anything we needed...they played with our children and even stole a few kisses from my 3 year old. In the evenings, staff was outside and eager to bring tea, drinks and even threw in a few treats for the kids...they sat and talked with us, and even played a game of chess with my son!!! Although my daughter would not accept the many proposals for love...LOL...she enjoyed her time too. I have to give a shout to the Deja Vu next door....the food was great and the staff amazing too....the guys all interacted and made our time very memorable.

My mother-in-law opted for the spa services of which she visited more than once and gave positive feedback. This hotel is in a great location being within a short walking distance to the major attractions of Istanbul and having a tram station within about two minutes walk. This was a definite plus point. The view from the breakfast area gave a fantastic panorama of the city of Istanbul's attractions. Breakfast itself consisted of a continental buffet of typical Turkish fare including olives, cheeses, cured meats and etc. Great for those who like this type of breakfast but probably not recommended for the type of tourist who wants to wake up to a fry up of bacon, eggs, sausages and the likes. The staff of the hotel are friendly and willing to answer your questions at any time of the day. The person in charge even offered to lend us his map of the city free of charge. However: The price of food at the hotel could be considered ridiculous. Be prepared to pay around $75 (USD) for two plates of cold dips, some soup and three soft drinks at lunch time. I would not like to begin thinking about how pricey the meals at dinner time would be. The price of food in other establishments around the, exceedingly touristy, area is comparable and not of much quality to rave about (foodies' nightmare). One of the most striking factors is that the menu prices seem to be written on by hand, possibly indicating that different prices are given to different guests? There is no kettle in the room so that guests can make tea or instant coffee for themselves. A saving grace was the cafe/bar across the street where we could get some English breakfast tea or freshly ground coffee for a reasonable price. The walls in the hotel allow for telephone rings and conversations to be heard clearly from your next door neighbors; which disturbed my sleep due to my neighbors being the types who engaged in intoxicated discussions from 1am to 6am. During our stay, the water supply in the hotel was disrupted for about four hours one evening. In all fairness, the staff did do their best to get the service up and running again as soon as they could.

I was going to be there only one night in transit to Zagreb, Croatia. I stayed two nights, one going to Croatia and one night returning. I was nervous being an American in a predominantly Muslim country. Not only was I totally impressed with Turkish Airlines, but I made a car reservation in advance. The car company (www.istanbulhotelstransfer.com) was amazing. As I came through the arrival doors, Bayram (my driver) was there waiting for me. greeted me with the biggest, warmest smile and welcomed my to his country, Turkey! Instantly, I felt at ease. He pulled the are around and loaded all of my things. As we drove from the airport to the city (about a 30 minute drive), he explained the city. Showed me the different building and their functions. It was a tour before I even set foot in the hotel!!!!!!! Freaking Awesome! Now lets talk about the hotel! when we got there, the porter (Paul) immediately met the car. By the time I could get out, Paul had already opened my door and unloaded all of my luggage. He was also already taking them to the front desk! When I was at the front, the receptionist (Ed) was so nice and welcoming. He answered all my questions BEFORE I EVEN ASKED THEM. I met a girl on the flight who was only in IST for 5 hours before her next flight. She came with me to the hotel and Ed (the front desk receptionist) took her back to the hotel on his way home after we toured the city! AWESOME! The room was a little small for me but, I was only there one night. But, when I returned a few weeks later, they upgraded me to a suite fot for a KING! Hahaha! I loved my whole experience there. The breakfast was a bit basic for American standards. I thought it suited their culture perfectly though. Plenty of bread, wonderful olives (all sorts), meats (all sorts), cheeses (all sorts), even bi=oiled eggs. A perfect start to my day. All in all, I highly suggest a stay here! The location is perfect! Once you step out of the hotel to the right you will hit all the major masques and to the left you will hit the water and all the splendors of the bustling city.

A visit to Trip Advisor brought us to the Empire Palace. A tall, large former city house, situated in the old European quarter of the city, has been remodelled into the present hotel. On our arrival we were greeted in a most friendly and courteous manner - we felt completely 'at home' in moments. Our room, on the fourth floor, might have seemed a little restricted but, baring in mind the original nature of the building, it's central location in the old quarter and in comparison to the older hotels of London it was actually quite spacious. The entrance hallway to the room housed a large wardrobe, which also contained a safe - and how refreshing to find no charge or Deposit required for its use. There was a 'queen' bed and a single bed, although the room was occupied only by my wife and I; there was an armchair, writing table and small desk as well as a refigerator and flat screen TV. The en suite bathroom was modern, very clean and with lashings of hot water. We had anticipated a tea/coffee making facility but that semed to be missing, however a quick call to Reception resulted in the prompt delivery of all we needed - along with genuine apologies. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and we slept soundly, completely unaware of the tram traffic that we knew ran along the roadway in front of the hotel (and our room faced onto this frontage). When we drew back the curtains next morning we saw a minaret directly opposite! We had not heard the traditional calls and wonder whether it was nolonger in use; there are over 2000 mosques in Istanbul! Up two floors from our room and one reached the roof terrace restaurant, from which one could see the Bosporus and where we enjoyed our breakfasts and an evening meal. The location of the hotel boasts that, by turning right on exiting the hotel it less than 400 metres from the fabled Blue Mosque. En route one passes the Topkapi Palace, St. Sofia's and the Bysantine underground Cistern - all an absolute MUST for any tourist. Turning left and following the useful tramtracks a similar distance brings you to the terminous of the famous Orient Express railway, the Spice Market, another 'blue' mosque that turned out to be even better than its larger counterpart and the Galatay Brdge acros the Golden Horn. The Bridge is a 'double decker' - the lower section is home to a famous collection of fish restaurants - whilst up above pedestrians can hire a rod and 'catch their own'; there are evn locals with charcoal braziers ready to cook your fish for you! The old quarter abounds in restaurants and tea rooms - with their bubble pipes - do try the Green Garden beside St. Sofia, 200 metres from the Empire Palace. The acid tests of any holiday are 'would you recommend the hotel and destination to a friend?' - well, we've been home six days now and recommended it to lots of friends - and 'would you return?' - we travel extensively but would love revisit Istanbul and use the Empire Palace for our stay.", "Date": "December 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Wales", "Title": "\u201cA great hotel in an ideal location\u201d", "Author": "RamblingBobSproat", "ReviewID": "UR50338979", "Content": "We spent three nights at the Best Western Empire Palace at the end of November 2009.

As I stayed at Easter weekend, I had to pay a bigger bill compared to last time. I would like to acknowledge a particular person at the front desk. Her name is Berrin. She is very hepful and understanding. I got an early check in and late check out as she helped me big time.

I am a reasonable person when it comes to hotels- i want a clean decent sized room, no mistakes with the booking and helpful staff. If you are the same then DO NOT try this hotel. On the night we got there they mistakingly gave us a twin room, they were not even apologetic nor did they offer us any form of compensation. The hotel staff suggested we push the beds together- the cheek. The did it for us but it was awful as i kept falling down the middle. The room itself was very noisy as the tram went right by the hotel and was very close to this room. My huband cheekily asked for a free meal in the hotel- which they gave...more fool us. It was disgusting food, and as we had heard the microwave going in the kitchen, we knew how they had cooked the food. If we had paid, it would have costed 30 euros a head! We did have to pay for our drinks, and 2 cokes was the equivalent of \u00c2\u00a35! We were very disappointed. The next day we were given a superior double room- nothing superior about this tiny room with too much furtniture crammed in- not worth the money at all, even if we did get a deal through expedia. The staff were not helpful with anything generally and tried to extort us for money every chance we got. The second day we had a turkish bath at the hotel, which was surprisingly good, but very expensive for what it was. My husband and i decided to have another Turkish bath (a salt scrub to be exact) the night before we left, but for me this was a disaster. A different woman did it and it was awful. The salt was burning my skin, the room itself was freezing, the woman couldn't speak a word of english or french, and she didn't know how to give a massage so it was just painful as i lay there in my bikini. Then the ditsy woman put the glass salt pot right near my elbow, it inevitably smashed and so she just rubbed me down with soapy water instead and tried to charge me for it. It was horrible!!! it really did ruin the whole experience and i would never stay in this supposed 4* hotel. To be honest I have stayed in hostels nicer than this place. The ONLY upside to this hotel would be the location, as it is in walking distance to the main sites- the blue mosque, hagia sophia etc. I did read the reviews on this site before i left, but i have the feeling the staff members may have made a few things up about the hotel on here so be weary. Erjan was NOT helpful at all, all the staff were USELESS, none of them seemed to care about the guests and it was just on the whole very disappointing. We need to get rid of foreign hotels ripping off tourists and taking advantage, so please stay away from this place.", "Date": "March 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cheshire", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel - You will not be disappointed\u201d", "Author": "hanife22", "ReviewID": "UR25207476", "Content": "We have recently come back from our first trip to Turkey. We had a magical time in Istanbul and stayed in a hotel that was pefect in location and close to such historical places as the Aya Sofia and the Blue Mosque. The hotel we stayed in was absolutely brilliant. The rooms were a good size, clean, as was the bathroom. One of the things that made our holiday memorable and wonderful was the service we received in the hotel. This was second to none and the friendly faces every day was very welcoming, in particular a member of staff called Beste. She was always able to help us out or arrange excursions for us. She was always helpful and kind and was an asset to the hotel. She could not do enough to help us. We found Beste to be very knowledgeable about the city and had a very approchable and friendly demeanour and was always ready with a smile. If we return to Istanbul again, as I am sure we will, we will definitely be staying at the Best Western Empire Palace again. Not only because of the wonderful hotel and team, but also because of Beste.
