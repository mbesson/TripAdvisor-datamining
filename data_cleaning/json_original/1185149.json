We stayed in the actual Residenza Favaro, which is down a little tiny alley and there is no reception or facilities at the building - just rooms. That's fine - if you know that. The room was tired and we were a little worried about using the electrical sockets - but despite all of that it's brilliant because of where it is. It's a short two min stroll to Saint Mark's Square - right on the poshest street in Venice with all the designer shops. Find the Bulgari jewellery shop, and you're there (well, down an alley). Views non existent, but you can get air in the room. It's nice a dark, so fairly cool (marble stairs keep it all cool too). Be prepared to firstly locate the premises, then you ring the bell and they either direct you to the other hotel where there is a reception - or a chap will come and meet you in five minutes. You might have to traipse to the other hotel to sort out paperwork etc. If you turn up to Venice with heavy suitcases - you're going to struggle - pack light, there's a lot of walking from any ferry stops and there's plenty of bridges with steps.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "sunshine coast", "Title": "\u201cA nice surprise!!\u201d", "Author": "parakerry", "ReviewID": "UR120435290", "Content": "Had booked in to Residenza Favaro for 3 nights.

And this actual property is not attached to a hotel proper. It is definitely more like renting someone's apartment than staying in a hotel--there was no front desk or staff to go to for question, recommendations, etc. On the plus side, it was surprisingly quiet for being in such a busy area.", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aix-en-Provence, France", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful stay in a surprising gem!\u201d", "Author": "leftmyheartinbergen", "ReviewID": "UR111146038", "Content": "We booked in to Residenza Favaro a little while ago, and were asked to check in at the nearby Hotel Ala on arrival. When we were collected to be taken to our room and what a fantastic surprise! We entered into a doorway just metres from the Grand Canal (Giglio stop). I don't know how long the hotel will be like this, because we were put in a new property that is still being renovated before opening. According to our host, Residenza Favaro is no longer and this was going to be their new hotel. It was clean, airy and spacious with fantastic facilities and free Wifi as well. Everything was made easy for us and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I would recommend this hotel to all of my friends (though I can't actually remember its new name!). Only one problem that might be encountered is that there is no lift and a few stairs to get to the rooms.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "essex.england", "Title": "\u201cGreat little find\u201d", "Author": "spearmint", "ReviewID": "UR104492347", "Content": "Thanks to a previous couple who posted exact details of how to get from Marco Polo airport to our Vaporetto water stop. 13 euros. Took a lot of worry and anxiety away when your in a foreign country. As we were arriving quite late in the evening. Also thanks to the hotel for e-mailing exact details how to get to the hotel Ala to check in from the water stop. All very efficient. This room we had at the Favaro was just what you needed. Quiet, comfy. Plenty of towels. Bed made up every day. Very clean. We had to take our own kettle and cups for our much needed cuppa's after walking around so much during the day. There was a fridge in the room. No supermarket to buy milk though. Would have liked a safe in the room to lock valuables away during the day, but if you have a combination lock on your suitcase, thats good enough. Breakfast at the Ala hotel is only continental, but still good. No fry- ups there. It will cost you 10 euros per person. Eating out is very expensive too. Just a small meal for two without bread or drinks will set you back 40 euros for two people. Very limited menus's. Its either Past, Pizza or Fish. I had a salad, lettuce, tomato and few sweet corn, presented in a bowl the size of a cereal bowl. 9 euros. ( what ) Public toilets plenty around Saint Marks square. That will cost you 1-50 euros. Trying to find a toilet anywhere else is difficult. The restaurants are i'm sorry to say very un friendly. You have to buy a drink or they will not let you use their facilities. So then when you have had your drink and a visit to the loo, you want to go again. If you move away from the tourist areas it becomes a bit better. We did find a restaurant, and they were lovely having said all that. Go across the Rialto bridge and just wander around the other parts of Venice. Much prettier. You will get lost, but you are never far away from anything. So dont panic. There are yellow signs if you look up on the street walls, and they will direct you back to where you need to go. Well worth going away from the typical tourist areas. Look out for the Gondolla near the Acedemia bridge. It will only cost you 50 cents to cross from one side of the grand canal to the other. Great value. Just walk and get lost. Its the best way to see the typical Venice. Would recommed the Favaro for a short stay. Its quite near St.Marks square, but 2 doors down an alley way which is very quiet, You have to use a credit type card to get into the front door, which is very secure by the way.
