On first impressions the hotel is a great. It is in an excellent location and even looks lovely from the outside and the lobby area is very inviting. The staff on reception were fantastic- very friendly. It is only when you get to your room do you see this hotel for what it is. The room was very old & small. The decor is extremely dated but to be fair and again with great credit to all of the staff at the hotel -it was clean. The bathroom was extremely small and was about 3ft from the bed- it offers absolutely no privacy for the occupant- with barely even enough room to dry off after a shower in the space. Our room was so small that we had to keep our suitcase on a chair in front of the door so that we could walk around the bed and access the bathroom. When we first went into the room we noticed that it was very cold & noisy- assuming that the windows were opened to perhaps air the room we attempted to close them. It was then that we noticed that the windows were closed but there was a gap of approximately 1 inch in between the top & bottom panes. We could actually put our hands outside the supposedly shut windows. Again the staff were helpful & sent up the maintance person to look at the problem - the only solution that he could offer was to fill the gaps with towels which he did for us. This seemed to solve the problem of the noise & cold, however there was a lage amount of condensation building up in the room over the weekend. Trying to make the best of a bad situation we made a decision to spend as little time as possible in the room over the weekend. I see from a lot of other reviews that for the price it is great hotel- I have to completely disagree with this. We spent \u00c2\u00a3100 a night on the place- which was certainly not good value for money given the standard of the room. You would be far better off staying in a Premier Inn or somewhere similar as they have a basic standard at least. On our last morning we noticed that there was a brownish fluid leaking from the vent in the bathroom on to the lid of the toilet. I am sure that if we had reported this to the staff they would have fixed the problem but at that stage we just wanted put this down to a bad experience so we packed our bag and left. My boyfriend mentioned to me that during his student days inter-railing across Europe that he stayed in nicer Hostels. I had always held the opinion that I would be happy enough to stay in a place that offered a clean bed and a hot shower- if I ever decide to return to London I may need to add a few more basic requirements to my wish list before I would consider booking.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma, USA", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, location\u201d", "Author": "DarekJarmola", "ReviewID": "UR122145371", "Content": "This is my default hotel in London!

Again- the major reason that I stay here is not the hotel itself, but it's location.

We were looking for something reasonably priced with parking and access to the tube system. The hotel gives a good first impression with a nice lobby and friendly front desk staff. There is limited (fee) parking just outside the door and spaces are a bit tight but we managed okay. Once past the front desk it seems that your experience might depend on the room you get. There were 4 of us and we had a lower basement room that was probably the most cramped room you could get outside of Manhattan. The beds were extremely tight and the bathroom the smallest imaginable. That being said, as we hadn't intended spending much time in our room and those travelling with me were family it wasn't the biggest issue for me and it served its purpose. It did however mean that the room was very warm and I'd imagine that it could get very hot in mid-summer. This is no doubt a function of the age of the building but a room on a higher floor might get a bit more space. Accessing the room was also a bit awkward with a lift that seemed to take for ever to arrive. The room was clean although there wasn'y much floor space to vacuum. Breakfast was surprisingly good and very popular. This hotel is very conveniently located for the underground with Paddington Station just around the corner. The hotel was also located just outside the congestion charge zone which was another reason for its selection as we were driving to it from Wales. Indeed the area is very accessible from the M1 as its almost a straight road into the area from the motorway network. The immediate area is quite pleasant although we didn't get a chance to frequent any of the bars or restaurants All in all, a reasonable proposition if you are not fussy about space and require convenient access to the tube.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ennis, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cWell positioned Hotel Excellent\u201d", "Author": "faraday99", "ReviewID": "UR121481442", "Content": "A well positioned Hotel, Excellent location with easy access to underground and train stations. hotel was very clean and tidy.

When I discovered that the dates for my reservation were incorrect, I immediately tried to contact the hotel, as did Booking.com. I did not want to cancel but did need to change the dates in November (over a month away).Finally somebody did email me to tell me that the fee was non- refundable. There was no effort to help me correct this mistake. Worse still, I sent two emails to the General Manager, politely asking for his assistance. No response. Nothing. He did not even have the courtesy to reply to my plea. So, the bottom line is, this hotel believes it is totally acceptable to charge people 100% of the cost of a room no matter whether or not you ever actually use that room.

They could at least try to vary the breakfast options in consecutive days ( I guess it doesn't take much to change the sausage for bacon every other day or add a different type of bread.

There was no airconditioning and it was incredibly hot in the room. At 7.30 in the morning we woke up due to the noise from the housekeepers and the doors from the breakfast room that were constantly slammed open and closed. Due to the heat in the room we opened te window, however the housekeeper just closed the window from te outside again! Next, the housekeeper tried to open our room even though you would think they know there are people in the room! After trying to come in with the key, she realised there were people in the room.

While checking out we complained at the front desk. However, the staff did not care at all. After doubting for a long time they told us they could not do anything. They did not understand what our problem was and no matter what had happened, we wouldn't get a refund or discount or whatsoever anyway. The only thing we could do was fill in a complaints form. After asking how this would help us they funnily said: nothing! We told them this was our second time visiting their hotel (they don't care about that either) and that we would never come back again. Another thing they didn't care about at all. Apparently they believe there are enough other customers anyway.The only positive thing I can say about this hotel is its location.

It is only 5 minutes walk to Paddington Station and is therefore very convenient for the Heathrow Express and tube. I had a single room - room 16. It is located between levels 1 and 2 on the mezzanine level. To access it, I had to climb up a flight of stairs and open a fire door before I could get to the door of the room. The fire door opens inwards towards the room door. This made it a bit clumsy getting my luggage into the room as I had to hold the fire door open with my luggage while opening the room door. There was no hair dryer in the room and no TV remote control. Disposable plastic cups were used in the bathroom sink. Only two small cakes of soap were provided - no hair shampoo. As with other traditional hotels in the Paddington area, there was no air-conditioning. Breakfast was in the basement - buffet style. Because it was summer, the hotel was quite full and if you went for breakfast at 8.30 am, you had to wait outside for another guest to vacate the table. At GBP 72 for a single room, it is not really worth the price. You can get a similar hotel in Sussex Gardens area for GBP 50.

The best selling point is its location, a block from Paddington Station, down a street of inexpensive, decent restaurants and an excellent, genuine pub (not a tourist trap). It can't be beat for convenience. However... The place reminded me of the old hotels and bedsits where I used to stay in the Bayswater neighborhood of London in the early-mid eighties. Except for the rather tacky (but new) lobby, the decor is definitely Thatcher-era. Worn, but clean. The elevator is one of the slowest I've ever experienced. We stayed in two different rooms. The first was incredibly cramped; I have friends who would have had trouble entering the room or using the bathroom. There wasn't enough room to open a suitcase, except for on the bed-- and these were carry-on sized cases, not full-sized. The second room was slightly less cramped, but on the top floor, and very, very stuffy. Both bathrooms were tight and in so-so condition, with a tiny cracked porcelain shelf over the toilet (!) that was just big enough to put your toothbrush on to dry overnight. Breakfast was as other reviewers have described it-- nothing to write home about-- though I liked the giant koi tank. No one told us that a TV remote could be had for a 10 pound deposit, so we did without, which was a bit of a nuisance. The wi-fi was crap, so overtaxed as to be nearly at a standstill, and really only usable in the lobby anyway. And the fact the the phones are rigged so that you can only make a local call with a phone card (never mind a long distance one) seems petty and mean. All that said, the staff-- with one exception, which I'll get to in a minute-- were sweet, friendly and helpful, and in no way would I blame them for the hotel's failings. Without them, the place would be a hellhole. As it is, it's a serviceable and conveniently located place to crash after a day of sightseeing or a night of partying. But that's all. This formula becomes a problem only when something goes wrong-- which for us, did. My mother lost her bank card at 11pm on a Saturday night, and we discovered that not only was it impossible to reach an operator from the hotel \"phones,\" even with a five pound phone card, but the guy who was staffing the front desk either did not speak English or was incredibly stupid. Either way, he gave me a number that turned out to be the emergency ambulance hotline. When I went downstairs to tell him this he looked perplexed, then just shrugged. We ended up having to get dressed again and walk over to Paddington Station at 1 am and use a public phone to place a collect call to Citibank. The next morning I asked the girl at the desk for a white pages so I could find the number of the nearest American Express office, since of course there were no phone books in the rooms. She didn't have one either. Thankfully I'd lugged my computer along and found the office by going online (which took 30 minutes with the hotel's crappy connection.) So-- if you need a reasonably price place to crash, and nothing else, you might consider the Westpoint/Abbeycourt.

We also travelled to Oxford and Windsor from Paddington. You can buy \"cheap day return\" tickets right at station. Numerous trains throughout the day. Don't bother booking head. Hotel is close to St. Pancras and Kings Cross for other trains out of London. There are a couple of tube lines that run through Paddington and most London attractions are a short ride and some are walkable. Lots of restaurants, pubs and shops nearby. Area around the hotel is clean and safe. Check-in and out was efficient, front desk staff helpful. Reception area very nice. Free internet which was usually available. Fairly quiet at night. Rooms, beds and bathrooms were clean. (other than the awful mildew smell of the shower curtain). Beds were old but okay. Now for \"the bad.\" Maybe 6 nights was a few too many. I don't remember our rooms being so tiny our first visit. We booked 2 twins. One of the rooms looked into a dirty lane/back of hotel. It was very stuffy even with the window open and the outside temp. was only 10 degrees. Ventilation was poor. This room smelled of food cooking (oil and spices) the entire time. The other room was fine since it faced the side of the hotel which is a quiet tree-lined street. One of the rooms had no space for luggage. Hotel uses duvets now which are way too warm. Rugs, wallpaper and paint all need replacement. Phones in room only work with a calling card - even for local calls. Pay phone downstairs is 20p for a minute (local call). Breakfast needs to be mixed up a bit. It was the exact same 3 years ago and its the same every morning. Cornflakes, instant coffee, toast, juice. Every table gets a few slices of really bad ham and okay cheese. Its the same every morning. Breakfast service is efficient and friendly. No complaints there. Cancellation policy is 7 days. People continue to smoke in rooms. We smelled cigarette smoke regularly in the halls. The smell woke me up at 4:00 a.m. so I called the front desk. They try (but not to hard) to \"track\" it down. I looked out my window and saw a woman smoking in the room adjacent, holding the cigarette out the window. The smoke was wafting into our room. She quickly \"butted out\" when I told her to \"put that cigarette out please!\" Management should be more diligent and not leave it up to guests to police this problem. A quick walk throughout the hallways on a regular basis is all they need to do. I would stay in this hotel again, (for a few nights) and request a room that does not face the lane. The location and price cannot be beat. P.S. If you want good (cheap) Thai food and a large variety of beer, try The Churchill Arms on Kensington Church Street.

I really can't see how it got any at all, never mind three. Even describing this establishment as a hotel is stretching the English language beyond its limit and certainly does no justice to all those REAL hotels out there. Stayed here over three nights last month - myself, my wife and our three children (two of them teenagers). I waited a couple of weeks before writing this review because I needed that time to cool down a bit before writing. We booked this place directly with the hotel because it was unclear whether they would accommodate 5 people in a family room. We were assured verbally on the phone that 5 people would not be a problem. Well it wasn't a problem until we got there and tried to check in - we almost had to beg to get them to put an extra bed in the room. Ahhh... the room!!! What a horrible smelly hole in the ground of a room it was. Even without the extra bed in there, you could hardly walk around the beds, though in hindsight, perhaps this was a blessing insofar as it minimized contact with the dirty, dreary carpet on the floor. We were only staying three days so we didn't have too much luggage with us but we still had to \"live out of our suitcases\" - there was not enough space/storage to facilitate complete unpacking of our one suitcase and a few small bags! This was a disappointing start to our city break. Never mind - we'll go out, get something to eat, walk the streets of London and we won't have to be back here 'til late. Well, we got back later that night and decided to go to the bar to get some quick snacks and drinks. Now, where could they possibly have put it? Aw no, No bar, No restaurant, No Snacks - Nothing! Back to our little hole in the ground - we squinted as we tried to watch a tiny 14-inch TV with only about 5 TV Stations to choose from. The beds were reasonably comfortable and the sheets were clean, but the blankets didn't smell too fresh. We were woken bright and early next morning by the staff starting their work shift just before 0700. They made quite a loud racket pushing containers and vacuum cleaners around and chatting and laughing so loudly. This turned out to be a daily ritual, and each day it continued for well over an hour. Did I mention the en suite bathroom? Indeed, we had a toilet and shower en-suite, but if you didn't enter the en suite at the correct angle, turning around or manoevering after you were in there was really quite difficult (and I'm not a large person at a mere 176cm/74kg). Oh yes, the shower... the wimpy little dribbly trickle of water that emanated from the shower-head was really quite pathetic - but apart from the discomfort factor of limited water and space, all of us taking a shower took probably three or four times longer than it should have, thereby wasting our valuable sightseeing time. There wasn't even room in there for a shelf over the wash-hand basin on which to keep toothbrushes, razor, etc - they were safely packed back into our bags after each use!! It's breakfast time - We made our way to the breakfast room. One of the walls had a floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall fish tank - this was really gross - the fish were large and ugly; fighting among themselves over bits of gunk in the water, and the tank's murky water looked like it could have come from the Thames itself!. Anyway, we're all very hungry and continental breakfast is complimentary. Well, when I saw it I knew why! The coffee was not freshly brewed - more like a cheap instant coffee from the 70's; the toast was cold and limp and rubbery - so rubbery in fact that I could not bite through it without gnashing. Some bits of \"meat\" and cheese on a plate were also provided but these too proved to be completely inedible to us. Looking through to the kitchens, I could see a team of people washing dishes in the large sink and drying them - manually!! They didn't even have a dishwasher. By the way, there's a Garfunkels just down the road - they do proper, tasty food and service with a smile. Incidentally, this so-called hotel has no pool, no leisure facilities, no lounge, no security on the baggage room (they lend you the key and you have unmonitored, unaccompanied access to everyone's bags!) no air-conditioning, no shampoo or shower gel in the bathroom (they did provide toilet paper though), no porter to assist with bags, the slowest elevator in the world (I used the stairs with my bags after waiting for 5 minutes), and absolutely nothing to recommend it. I will not darken their door with my presence ever again - not if I was paid to. Frankly, a park bench in nearby Hyde Park is more appealing.

He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find it, nor did he ask us if it was alright if we let him look around. 10mins later another staff member came in looking for something, I presume the same object but they never told us. Then 10mins later another one came in. They were completely rude, never knocked to come in and never apologised. Later that night I hoped in bed to watch some TV and drift off. The TV had no remote... In the morning we were awoken by someone looking to clean our room.

The hotel was the typical small hotel in London, however many things made it stand out as being not so typical. While its outside is the same white front with columns as you will see down many roads in London, its inside is what makes it stand out. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Everyday our beds were made, bathrooms cleaned, and we were given fresh towels, which is not something you will always find in Europe. The rooms were very clean, rooms and hallways were a little small, but that is to be expected. Other great things the hotel offered was free internet access which was a surprise to us, but very helpful. As well as complimentary breakfast every morning, nothing too exciting just toast, dry cereal, juice, and coffee, but it was a great start to long days and its nice to have something free when the pound is the equivalent of $2. The hotel also offers a great, safe location. It is a very short walk to Paddington station, both tube and train, and it also has a great variety of restaurants and shops right around the corner. My personal favorites, San Marco Ristorante if you want Italian, and Garfunkels if you want something a little more American. My one and only complaint is the lack of Air Conditioning in the rooms, but that as well is to be expected in most London hotel rooms. There is a nice sized window in each room, but sometimes I wished it would have been a lot cooler in the room. But even the Sheraton Hotel right next to Buckingham Palace that we stopped to go to the bathroom at, didn't have air conditioning. So it is something you will just have to deal with. So without A/C in consideration I would give this hotel a 5 star rating for sure. You just can't beat a good deal, with great staff and great location.

Please read through and decide for yourself. This is long but details are important. We arrived at Abbey Court Westpoint Hotel with our 2 year old and 14 year old sons, on Monday 17th of April right after the Easter weekend. We paid two days in advance (that is half of our stay) because that was the hotel's policy. We had a very horrible experience that made us understand why. At first we were pleasantly surprised, the location is great, the apartment was well equipped, clean, the cot for the little one was ready. The bathroom was very hot and we understood that it was because the water in the toilet was boiling hot as funny as it may sound. We reported the problem and were told that it would be taken care of. At around 6:30pm that evening the toilet flush sink cracked and boiling water started to pour down in the bathroom!!! The reception clerk (who was genuinely very nice I must add) came right away and could hardly touch the main tap leading to the sink in order to stop the water because it was so hot. A few minutes later he came back with the owner of the hotel who did not bother to apologize or even say hello for that matter. Because of the late hour and no other apartment available, we were given the key to another room at the end of the hallway to use the bathroom and were told that the problem would be solved first thing in the morning. Not ideal but we understood the situation... Next morning starting from 8:30 until we left a little before 10am, I had to have at least three phone conversations with the new shift at the reception desk re-explaining the problem and asking that the room be usable by 1pm when I would be back with our little one. The best commitment I could get was a very impatient \"OK MADAM! I will leave a note to Room Service!!!\" Please keep on reading, this is a horror story!!! When I came back with the little one a little before 1:30 pm, and asked for the key to the room, the people at the reception desk could not find it so they told me that the worker was probably still there. I was quite upset because my son had a fever and I wanted to put him to bed as soon as possible. I went to the apartment anyway but the door was locked and the tools of the worker were outside, and he himself nowhere to be found! I went back to the reception and asked again for the key. I understood that they did not want me in there before the work was done. I had to endure 30 minutes of going back and forth and on-going negotiation to get my key. I asked to speak to the manager, he was \"on holiday\", I asked to speak to some kind of a person in charge, and that was the lady who had told me coldly that they were doing the best they could when I first asked for the key, and she had gone to lunch leaving me in the lobby with my son\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 At that point I simply demanded to go into my room and was very generously offered to put my son to bed in another room which I refused because that meant that I still had to go into my room pack some clothes, diapers and transfer his cot. No need to say that I was very upset by then and outraged by the service I received, or the lack of it. I said that I would not pay for that day, that they could call the police if they wanted to but I would not pay! Finally the very-frustrated-reception-clerk agreed to open the door for me, after raising her voice at me and slamming at my face the door of the office leading to the reception desk where she went in order to get the master key. In the meantime the workers appeared at the door and they continued their work while I attended to my son in the living room. This is where the real horror begins... Suddenly, while I was taking my son's temperature with his diapers down, somebody simply barged into the room without even knocking. I recognized the owner of the hotel who I naively thought had come to apologize. He started to shout at me standing very close to me physically and wagging his finger at me, told me if I did not intend to pay I should pick up my things and leave right away. The tone of his voice and his body language were so aggressive that I got really afraid for my son and myself. I asked him to lower his tone, but his answer was that this was his place and he could do whatever he wanted and that the police could not help me. I told him that I did not want to have this discussion in front of the child that we would speak when my husband returned, but he would listen to none of that. He kept telling me that HE would call the police and if I did not leave they would throw all my things out, that they had been very nice to us and that nobody could speak to his staff \"that way\". At some point he even ordered the workers to leave the job undone and leave. Trying very hard to stay calm I told him that in the name of Go.d I had not spoken badly to anyone, and that is where things got really ugly. Our address reads Israel, he said \"You are using my electricity, you slept here you used my money, what kind of God is this God of yours!!! You pay me right now for the rest of your stay or get out of here\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" waving his hand as if he were flicking away a piece of dirt. At some point during all this yelling and shouting (by the owner of the hotel only, because I had to stay calm for the wellbeing of my son), the lady who had gone to lunch (because she is a \"human being\" unlike myself and my son) came in (without knocking of course) and said that I had indeed not insulted them or called them names or anything but I had been very \"harsh.\" While the two of them started discussing about our fate! I grabbed the opportunity to call my husband. When he arrived the suitcases were already packed and of course we left that horrible place as quickly as we could. On our way out when my husband asked to speak with the owner of the hotel he was not there and there was only the same junior and very fragile reception clerk. Of course nobody talked about any reimbursement that the owner had mentioned under his breath during his attack. I simply could not bear to stay another minute there anyway, or face those people again, so we left having paid full price for that agony. I was assaulted certainly verbally but also physically, my privacy was violated, and I was robbed\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I will most certainly report this ugly event to the authorities. This is my story, what you make of it is up to you.

The first time it was called \"Abbey Court Hotel\", but now is called the Westpoint. My main reason for choosing it was the location and the price. The price is great for London (especially this area of London) and the location is wonderful. The Paddington tube stop is about a block away and the hotel is in the Hyde Park area, within walking distance to many sights and near several gorgeous parks. The neighborhood is charming, with tree-lined streets, pond, parks and many restaurants within a block or two of the hotel. A laundrymat and several internet cafes are also near by. The hotel itself is nothing fancy. The lobby is nice and had many brochures for tours, sights, etc. The desk staff is helpful and someone was always around, no matter how late we came in. The rooms are small and not well decorated (ours had a weird framed poster of seals), but were very clean and the maid service came every day. I couldn't care less about the decor of the room as long as it is clean and affordable! The breakfast isn't great, but it is fine for a moderately priced hotel. They have croissants, rolls, cheese, ham, coffee, juice. Our rooms had a heater we could adjust, a phone, and a TV with several channels. Bottom line is this is a good hotel for people who want a cheap, clean, safe, convenient place to stay but who are planning on spending more time exploring London than sitting in the hotel.", "Date": "August 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay here\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3693335", "Content": "After spending a wonderful time in efficient, clean and comfortable Tokyo with my girlfriend it was her turn to visit me in London. We chose the Westpoint Hotel solely due to it being close to Paddington station and because I hadn't booked into anywhere else (won't make that mistake again). It was roughly the same price as the Tokyo hotels I had stayed in but shockingly inferior in quality. The first room we stayed in had no water pressure in the shower and no hot water. When I phoned the reception I was told that the cleaners had used all the hot water and that I should wait a few hours. After a few hours there was still no hot water. I phoned several times to complain but as soon as the rather dim reception realised I was complaining he would hang up the phone. I had to walk downstairs and ask to speak to the manager before they would change our room. Because my girlfriend had spent a lot of money coming to London I was doing my best to make light of this situation. The new room they moved us to was identical in size and decor but it did have luke warm water and the shower, as poor as it was, did allow for a light shower. Unfortunately, my heart sank when in the evening a mouse would decide to pay us a visit. I didn't have the heart to tell my girlfriend and explained to her that the reason why I was using a blanket to block the one and a half inch gap between the floor and the door was to prevent a draft. I have stayed in many decent hotels in London and felt truly ashamed that I had exposed my girlfriend to this monstrous place. If you're the kind of person that could rough it in the streets then you would find this place tolerable. However, if you want somewhere clean and relaxing where all the amenities work then I would recommend you stay well clear of the Westpoint Hotel.", "Date": "July 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney Australia", "Title": "\u201cWould stay again\u201d", "Author": "Leo_on_tour", "ReviewID": "UR3618016", "Content": "Good Service, good breakfast, good location near restaurants, internet cafes, laundromat and central to Paddington Stn.
