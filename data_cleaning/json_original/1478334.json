Luckily, we had brought earplugs, but the cleaning-staff threw them away, and though we complained, the hotel staff did nothing to reimburse us or buy us new ones.

The company we booked with had arranged for them to do this but as there was a conference at the Trade Centre they were taking people there and left us standing at the port. They apologised and when we finally got to our room it was very nice, quite spacious clean and modern. We didn't have much of a view but then we didn't intend to spend time in the room. staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet was of a good standard and we enjoyed the pool area when the weather permitted. We also had the pizza deal around the pool area which we thought was good value for a 4 star hotel. We also used the Mercato Mall shuttle which worked out fine but there wasn't too much there to spend the 3 hours between pick ups. We took a taxi to the Dubai Mall which was only 20dhs so that was good value. Quite a few restaurants and fast food outlets in easy walking distance.

What is the point of having this system if it isn't used, we had to ask the cleaners to come at 10.30am on the 3rd day. And even then, not all the litter was cleaned away. We constantly had to ask for more teabags and water as they only provided 2 at a time.The hotel was in the process of changing hands, which we weren't informed about previously and when we asked the simple question of what was the balance on our room, they couldn't help us cos they 'didn't know the new system' surely training should have been given beforehand!!! The A/c in room was noisy and the new years eve party going on the rooftop till 3am was far far too loud and kept us awake. We could never get to sit around the rooftop pool as it was always too busy. Because of the changeover, the room service list disappeared from our room. Staff far too unhelpful.

Being a Gold Medalist in singing and a stage performer, I can easily recognize his voice quality and I greeted him also after end of their band. Keyboard and rhythm players need to concentrate more on music rather than chatting between them so that they can put their best. As we are fond of kebabs, we have ordered set menu to enjoy the food. But there was almost 10 minutes delay for serving next kebab and later unless we look at the counter no service was provided for serving kebabs. I informed about this delay to one of the captains also. Due to this delay, we lost the craze and taste of kebabs and then we asked them to start main course and further desert. The quality of the kebabs was okay but can be improved more. Finally, it took almost 2 hours to complete the entire set menu.

They have also got a good basic gym and pool at the rooftop, supported with an interesting Spa. All in all, for what we were prepared to pay for the trip, it was just what we asked for!

I stayed then a longer period and as I remember I made a review at that time. So when I was back, this month, I was really good surprised to see that the staff remembers me, both with my habits, too. Also, as i made this period 2 times check-in (short business trips reasons) each time I received nice free fruits baskets from the hotel, as considered already an old and regular client . The check-in - check - out was very fast & easy, as usual. As hotel guest, got following facilities, during my stay: - free internet; - free pick-up / drop-in from.to airport; Also, as i had late trips during my stay, the management of the hotel accepted to make late check-out, no charging for this. The room charge was little bit higher than in July, but was normal, as long as the season restarted in Dubai. Anyway, was much cheaper than other similar hotels and included, as mentioned, a lot of facilities. For me the quality of the services and hospitality remained the same; as mentioned I felt like home there, a difficult task for a hotel to satisfy the clients with different culture and habits. As changes from the previous visits: the evening singers from the main restaurant were replaced with new ones (I say a good replacement, as the repertory is much various now). Also, if last time, was steaks - house each evening, this time was not more but I was told that will be prepared something new. As I had to leave, hope to find the new surprise for clients next time. Overall, I have the same good impression as last times and I was really pleased to be treated like an old guest whom habits are already known from now.

That said, there is a nice bar onsite (the Liquid Lounge) which features local entertainment and decent food but I wish they'd turn the AC down, it was freezing in there at times. We also had dinner at the restauarant and it was sumptious. Breakfast was less exciting, but ample. The rooms were beautifully finished and very peaceful: we slept well every night.

Possibly it was our mistake and we need to book suite - but we were disoriented by description of this room type on the hotel site (37 sq. m).

Live music in execution of 2 Russian girls during dinner is very pleasant also. - Hotel staff was very polite and helpful - and very kind for our small daughter As a resume I can say that it was good trip from Moscow -20C to Dubai +25C - one week of summer in the heart of snowy winter.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sweden", "Title": "\u201cGood and bad\u201d", "Author": "L-Cay", "ReviewID": "UR91147646", "Content": "We stayed at the Gold Swiss five nights over christmas and had a mixed experience.

For a start, the location avoids the busy traffic congested area of Bur Dubai or Diera but if you want to visit these places you can easily take a taxi, they are not far.

We finally had to ask a taxi driver for directions to the hotel next door because it is known. We arrived around 7am so we were told that we would have to wait a couple hours for our room to be ready. When it was \u201cready\u201d it seems that the housekeeping forgot to clean the bathroom. It was dirty with a clump of hair on the floor. We requested to have it recleaned when we went out which resulted in a semi-surface cleaning. The next night we asked for an electrical adaptor and were told one would be sent up. Thirty minutes later called again and was told it would be sent. Then three hours later when we called to complain, we were told that there weren\u2019t any available. The front desk person could not provide a reason why we were told differently the two times earlier. A few days later another clump of hair was found in the shower. Ironically when we got locked out and asked housekeeping to open the door we said that we had complained so it was better to go to the front desk to have the card fixed. After five days complaining cleaning was better yet still not what you would expect from a 4-star hotel. This hotel is really a gloried 3-star establishment.

Its location is quite convenient as it lies in Bur Dubai close to the main districts but on a tranquil road. Cosy Arabic architecture which makes it stand out among the other buildings and a well-appointed wide lounge where several facilities and services are available: reception, concierge desk, tour desk, business centre, three restaurants, shop, beauty centre, lifts and a comfortable sitting area with a beautiful piano too. Very nice is the corner dedicated to the traditional Beduin camp. The rooms are subdivided into several categories: I stayed in a Premium Room. Wide, carefully furnished and properly enlightened, it offers a big wardrobe, tea & coffee making facilities, minibar, large bed with comfortable pillows, bedside tables, ample writing desk, captivating red armchair with footstool, side-board and luggage board. The bathroom is particularly pleasant and functional (though lacking of a bidet) as it offers separated bath and shower. Many mirrors (not only in the bathroom) including the make-up one allow you to check your look from all perspectives. Among the most appreciated amenities, the ironing tools (including the board) and the safe. The wired high-speed internet connection is unfortunately charged (rate per hour AED 30 - around Euro 6 - which is rather expensive). Located at lounge level and called \"Senses\", the breakfast room/restaurant is bright, wide and well furnished. Every day there is some new food and beverage on breakfast: generally speaking, there is a choice of various small cakes, bread (to be also toasted), jams/marmelades, honey, juices, milk, yogurts, smoothies, fresh fruit (both entire or cut into pieces), corn, chocko and bran flakes, dried fruit, bircher m\u00fcsli, cheese and lots of salted preparations, fresh salads and tomatoes. Live cooking station with a chef constantly available from 06:30 to 10:30h to prepare your crepes, omelette and much more. The attentive staff serves hot beverages at your table. At the entrance a good number of newspapers and magazines is available for free, but only in Arabic whereas every brochure, city map and information sheet is always available in English too. On last day of my stay I also spent a couple of hours at the pool on the rooftop. It is quite small but offers a cosy panel with small waterfalls and an area equipped with sun beds and umbrellas. Bath towels are free. You just have to pay attention to the black tiles as they can become slippery when wet; nevertheless, they are alternated in chessboard-style to the grey ones which are not slippery. It is definitely a hotel which I would recommend for its extensive range of effective services and amenities available as well as for the comfort it offers, its reasonable rates and convenient location (however, some slight improvements about the expertise of a part of the staff at the reception and/or concierge desk would be appreciated). On my birthday, I was pleasantly surprised to receive from the hotel management a slice of cake with their wishes.

At first when entering the classic room I was rather disappointed that the room appeared much smaller than the impression from the photo over the internet, only two other negatives about the classic room was that the lighting in the bathroom was very dim & had a shower hose above the bathtub without any curtain or glass panel, therefore after taking a shower the whole floor was completly satuated. I mentioned this to the reception staff & within a very short time upgraded me into a much larger room at the same rate, nice to move around in my room & enjoy the relaxing modern bathroom. B/fast was well presented with many choices & waiters & waitresses were very polite & professional. Decided to try the massage on the 4th level again very relaxing & professional with a good rate of 250 AED for 90 min's. On the roof-top a small pool with only a few sun beds, with a good view towards the city. Small shop within the hotel lounge area, useful for stamps, but rather expensive especially when buying gifts!

Free Hotel shuttle bus either to Dubai Mall or to Jumeirah beach area which ran in both directions a couple of times a day. Never had any problem in finding a taxi outside the hotel, just a couple of times the taxi drivers would try to take the long way back on my return to the hotel, after a pleasent reminder that I knew where I was heading for they appeared to head direct in the right direction! Never used the internet it appeared very expensive. Staff were very helpful in advicing on booking intresting tours especially to the BURJ AL ARAB HOTEL for cocktail drinks and spent around 2hrs looking & taking many photos of this fantastic hotel.

The customer service is also great - we came in (we booked 2 rooms) within a 15 min time we have been given the keys from the room, a shuttle service bus schedule which is very handy because you will spend a lot on taxis in Dubai. The shuttle bus has 3 directions : Beach (with a nice garden in front of the beach where you can have a nice walk and take great photos), Merkato Mall which is on the way to the beach, and the Dubai Mall which will save you at least 40-50 DHS a day if using this service, it is also not far from Dubai Mall and Burjuman Mall.

The hotel has a nice pool on the roof which is very good to have after a long, hot and tiring day in Dubai. The water is 25-29 C and is well maintained and controlled. My daughter had a great experience there both in the mornings and evenings. The good thing about the pool is that it is partly covered which is handy for those who do not want to sunburn. Breakfast: There was a selection of white and brown bread, also cookies like croissant and other. We also had tried sausages, pancakes, fried eggs and etc. They serve good cappucino and coffee, various yougurts. The hotel had a various selection of fruits as well. Everything very fresh and delicious. Despite the reviews of travellers about poor service i would say on the contrary that it WAS JUST GREAT. Me and my family still talking about this hotel and recommend our friends to definitely stay there. The hotel has 2 restaurants : Kebab connection and Senses. We did not try them as we were out very often. A drive to Deira from hotel costs around 22 DHS, drive to Wild Wadi aquapark costs around 45 DHS, take a taxi from WILD WADI to Emirates Mall which will save you money it will cost you only 8 DHS but you will pay 10 as min fare in Dubai taxis. I can write a long story about this hotel however it would not express all my impressions about it unless you try it yourself. Do not hesitate to stop your choice on GOLD SWISS BELHOTEL and you will DEFINITELY not regret this GREAT choice.", "Date": "March 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNo problems\u201d", "Author": "magpie_rover", "ReviewID": "UR59754175", "Content": "We arrived in the early hours of the morning after lengthy customs at the airport.

Swimming pool extremely small; there's a real lack of sunbeds for those guests wishing to soak up some rays in between the sightseeing. Watch out for rooms facing the main road or on the corner of the building, above the bar, as the road noise is almost continual through the night, and a couple of nights we were kept awake by the music from the bar downstairs. None of the taxi drivers we used had heard of the hotel, so you'll need to use the nearby hotel, the Capitol, for directions.

The Duty Manager called 'Hamiath' was completely pathetic as he kept disappearing inside the office every 2 minutes without giving us information about whether we had a bed for the night. After waiting for 20mins, he did not even tell us that he had found our booking. He then said that it hadnt been confirmed but then I pointed out that the booking form had my credit card number on it and had been confirmed. 'Oh yes' he remarked without any type of apology. Then 20 mins further, they still could not find us a room as they were so booked up. They only had a twin room for my husband and myself even though we had wanted a double. Once again no apology and he just kept disappearing into the back office. Eventually we just took the twin room as we were so tired. When we got to the room, it was a SMOKING room and we had booked a non smoking room. Our clothes started smelling of cigarette smoke. We told the staff and they said that it would take an hour to put us in a non smoking room. The duty manager Hamiath came over to us with my booking form in his hand and started saying that we hadnt requested a non smoking room but once again I had to point out with my finger where i had requested it on the booking form and then got quite angry with him but once again he said nothing...not even sorry! He is a complete waste of time and should go back and get some more training! Especially on how to read a simple booking form. We were offered no complimentary drinks or food while we waited for our room. It was a disgrace! We finally got into our room at 1AM and were so angry and upset!!! The next day we were moved into a double room but it was so inconvenient moving luggage around etc. There were other problems too as one day we were not given any towels in the room and had to call up for them. Another day the restaurant staff rang our room at midnight to ask if we could bring down a receipt that the waiter had accidentally handed to us as they needed it for the accountant...i was in complete shock that they would ring so late but they had no idea!! Basically the hotel is nice and clean and in a good location but the staff are inexperienced and very immature! I think that staff from other SwisBel Hotel Chains need to come and monitor what is going on there and really show them what to do. I would not stay there again. Also it took us 40mins to check out as there was 1 person at the front desk during 11am which is peak checking out time!!

This is a very new hotel (opened a few months ago) and there are a few small issues which they have not yet got quite right, but I believe they are working on them. The hotel has two restaurants and a lounge bar, with a small rooftop pool, where you can order snacks and drinks. The area round the pool is quite small and there are only about six loungers and a few tables/chairs, so it can get full quite easily. There are good views of the Dubai skyline from the roof. We did not eat in the Kebab restaurant, so cannot comment, but the food in the other restaurant \u2013 Senses was excellent. The breakfast buffet was very extensive \u2013 both hot and cold with eggs and omelettes made to order. In the evening the two dinners we had were also very well prepared and presented. The only downside was the lack of support for the restaurant \u2013 on both evenings there were perhaps only another two or three tables occupied in what is a fairly large area \u2013 this was a shame. One criticism was that a dinner buffet deal which was on offer early in our stay (and which was extremely good value) was withdrawn without notice. The bar has a happy hour from 6pm \u2013 8pm with 2 for 1 drinks \u2013 a pint of Stella cost 32 dirhams. The location of the hotel is OK \u2013 between the old town area and Jumeira beach, however neither area is realisticaly walkable. The hotel runs a free shuttle bus to the public beach at Jumeira (5 dirhams entry) \u2013 leaving at 10:30 and returning at 2:30 \u2013 this was good. There are also shuttle buses running to two of the malls, however, what the timetable doesn`t tell you is how long it takes to get there. For the Dubai Mall which is ten minutes away by taxi, the bus takes over an hour. Taxis are usually available outside the hotel and are reasonably priced \u2013 although the private luxury cabs are about 50% more expensive than the marked licensed taxis. There are a couple of restaurants opposite the hotel \u2013 Chinese and Iranian \u2013 we didn`t try them. A bit further along on Al Diyafah Road (5 minutes walk) there is quite a selection of restaurants. We at in a Lebanese place Al Mallah \u2013 which was remarkably cheap - \u00a320 for two courses for two. The hotel will organise transport from/to the airport at 100 dirhams \u2013 more than a standard taxi \u2013 but there is some comfort in pre-booking \u2013 particularly for pick up at the airport where it can get very busy. The staff were all very polite and welcoming and always tried to sort out any issue we had. We drew the manager`s attention to a couple of these and he was quick to respond and act \u2013 treating our comments as constructive. We got what I thought was a very good deal for bed and breakfast \u2013 around \u00a3110 per day \u2013 including taxes \u2013 which are 20% ! All in all I would say the hotel is well worth considering if you don`t want to be on the beach or right in the town.", "Date": "January 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Venice, Italy", "Title": "\u201cOn a Learning Curve\u201d", "Author": "anticorpo", "ReviewID": "UR53772260", "Content": "This hotel has just opened doors and one will feel it.
