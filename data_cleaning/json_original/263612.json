We were looking at nearly 500 Euros a night before we found Soggiorno Battistero. The most important criteria to us at the time was cleanliness. But, now that we've stayed there, we learned about a lot of other things that contribute to a comfortable stay. I can understand why so many people rate this hotel so highly, but it's really not worth the savings.POSITIVES* Location* Kelly tries hard* It's cheap* We didn't see any pestsIf that doesn't sound like enough, it's because it's not.OTHER CRITERIA (NEGATIVES)Furnishings were sparce...that's to be expected and accepted. We didn't mind. Just be ready.Breakfast was poor -- even for Italy. At first I was impressed by the oven fresh muffins. After three days of my wife telling me that they were from the microwave, on the fourth day Kelly's husband didn't take the time to nuke it for 10 seconds and it was cold like a rock. Nope, they weren't fresh after all. But the other interesting thing is that although the rooms were non-smoking, the breakfast trays reeked of cigarettes...every day.The bathrooms were barely clean. The Ikea shower curtain showed its age and was moldy. A towel on the floor was hung back up. The clean towel rack was lined with dust from the Renaissance.We had a back room that was far from quiet as some reviews suggest. Because it's in the heart of a tourist zone, we heard restaurateurs throwing out their trash for what seemed like all night. Then the bums came in and the sound of glass bottles and the sorting of trash added to the din.Sheets were clean. Blankets...?The most troubling part of the experience is the management's insistence on coming into our room EVERY day (despite our requests not to) and even rearranging our things. I stay at over a hundred hotels per year (I'm a consultant) -- I've never seen anything like this.Managing a hotel in a place like Florence is EXTREMELY difficult work. This place tries, but not nearly enough. In the end, the savings weren't worth it. This place would be PERFECT for a backpacker under 25.

This is the second time we have been to Florence so we were familiar with the area. Selected the hotel based on its listing in Rick Steve's book. The owner, Kelly, was very helpful in recommending restaurants and in arranging to make reservations for restaurants and musuems (I would recommend that you make reservations for the museums during the peak tourist season- its worth the extra couple of euros.) Location of the BB was perfect. Right next to the Duomo. Did not have a room with a view but that can be a blessing in disguise if you want a quiet night's rest. Lots of steps to climb to get to the BB. Going up and down the stairs a few times a day helps to burn some of the calories gained from the wonderful food that one consumes, but if you have a problem climbing stairs or have heavy luggage, it can be an issue. The breakfast was punctually served and filling (not your typical Italian breakfast. More of a continental style breakfast-Coffee, juice, warm muffins, jam, packaged toast and cheese )Room was clean, spacious and airy. If it gets too hot, switch on the overhead fan (they also have airconditioning-but did not need to use it.) The bathroom was clean, but was a bit tiny. Almost ran out of toilet paper, had to ask for another roll. and for soap. We had a very comfortable and pleasant stay here.

The kicker..........best rate by far as long as you do not mind climbing a few flights of stairs, which I used as a valid excuse to justify more gelato tasting.

Luca was very helpful with a local gelato place which wasn't right by the Duomo. Gelatos are super expensive in Florence but he recommended a place that has over 30 HOMEMADE flavors and only 2 euros for a cone with 3 flavors. I loved their small reception area where I would write in my journal at night and browse the restaurant business cards. I found LEONARDO (a self-service restaurant) to be exactly what I was looking for: no cover charge, no tips, I picked my own food, excellent choices, and no waiting for the bill! All in all I completely recommend SOGGIORNO BATTISTERO and please disregard other negative or non-stellar reviews.
