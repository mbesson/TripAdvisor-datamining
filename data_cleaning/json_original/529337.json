But there are many hotels near Rome Termini Train Station, you would be glad that you do not stay at Hotel Urbis. TV does not work, and the receptionist acted like it would and tried to play with the switch a while. He said will find out if switch us to different room or bring a TV, but this issue was never addressed. The free internet on the PC in the hotel lobby did not work. Their own PC works just fine. There is no hot water for shower. They gave different excuses each time you ask them, either someone accidentally shuts it off or someone else used up all the hot water. It is 8 degrees at night by the way! The sewer smell came into our room from the bathroom drain. The wall and door is very thin, you can hear the staffs talking or the phone rings. Out of the three receptionists we encountered only one speaks a little English. The other two ask you to deal with his next shift. The building is very old and the room very dirty. It is by far the worse hotel we have ever stayed through out of our worldly travel. We have a room with private bath. The bathroom is the size of a normal closet. The shower is by the toilet so both toilet and the floor stay wet if you shower. There is a curtain with very disgusting stains on the bottom.

No Air conditioning and a very, very noisy street view. . i had paid for a triple room ( the only rooms with an en-suite ).... we clearly had not been allocated one. i went to reception to complain - the member of staff could no longer speak english, and told me to come back in the morning and we could be up graded at a cost, if we so wished. the agent we booked through offered no assistance.. we were then told we had to use the commuunal bathroom, that was no bigger than 3m x 3m, filthy, with a soaking wet floor and a dirty shower enclosure that did not work. Truly disgusting, far worse levels of sanitation than i have ever encountered in my life, and after 20 minutes made up our minds to find somewhere else to stay.... we used the free internet PC in the reception to duly book another hotel, 2 streets away..which was unbeleivably brilliant... and duly checked out within 4 hours of arriving and checked in there... i though't i'd got a brilliant deal with this hotel....... but was truly horrified when i arrived and urge anybody even thinking about being tempted by the price NEVER, EVER TO STAY THERE......", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cONE STAR TOO MANY!\u201d", "Author": "Martina J", "ReviewID": "UR127084171", "Content": "This is hardly a hotel in the first place, not even a hostel.

At one point we came back to a group of junkies from the nearby Termini Station shooting up in the stairway. While the area around the station is pretty rough it is also centrally located and the nearby metro station makes it a cheap alternative in an increasingly expensive Rome. Hotel Urbis doesn't control the ground floor door like most of the other hotels in the area and this leads to all kinds of rifraf having access to the building.

Unfortunately on my return this year in January for three nights- we booked a double with shared bathroom for 45 euros per night- things took a turn for the worse on our stay I was part of a six week tour around europe- we stay in a mixture of hotels from one to five stars but do not stay at back-packers. This was the worst hotel i have stayed in during the entire trip. The Good points. 1. The hotel has an excellent location- it is 2 minutes walk from the rome train station- you cannot hear trains so noise is not a problem. 2. There is free internet to use. 3. Its Ok for the price. My Rough Guide book recommends a hotel down the road from this one called Faulty Towers- I think next time I will try that hotel 4. There is a man on reception called Mr Giovanni, he is super-friendly- probably the only thing the hotel has going for it The things the hotel needs to improve on. 1. During the night I heard mice running around the room! 2. The rooms were not cleaned properly- there was still loads of dust on floor. 3 The shared bathroom was DISCUSTING!!! Pooh stains smeared on the side of the bowl- reminded me of an ex-flattie i had to kick out of my flat. Sewage smells etc . the shared bathroom always ran out of loo paper 4. Shower leaked and there was a timer on the shared bathroom which meant lights went out after 10minutes. 5. The hotel must have over-booked in one of the rooms because we were sharing the bathroom with six other German males- early in the morning my sister needed to use the toilet in the other corridor( Our shared toilet was in use ) but was rudely told she could not by a man at reception. I was very disappointed in my stay at this hotel- its sign boasts to be the Romes friendly hotel- When I return to Rome I would not stay here again- I think there is better service at other hotels.", "Date": "February 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "mo", "Title": "\u201cNot so bad, but expensive\u201d", "Author": "lkpg", "ReviewID": "UR6046091", "Content": "We found the hotel easy close to Termini.
