Also, bring your own pillows and be prepared for very hard mattresses. As I write this review, I am choking on this very bad odor that I can't put my finger on. The price was advertised for $219 per week plus tax, but the desk clerk charged me $259.00 plus tax, so their advertising is misleading.

I traveled alone and on a tight budget ~ couldn't believe the room was just $28.66. The room was perfect. I'm a non-smoker and couldn't smell any cigarette smoke. Many times I've stayed in non-smoking rooms that reeked of cigarette smoke. There is a small mirrored closet complete with iron and ironing board if needed. There was a single queen size bed, extra linens and pillows to make up the sofa bed if needed. (Some rooms have 2 beds). My bed was very comfortable. You enter the room and straight ahead is the kitchenette and little dinette table with 2 chairs. Refrigerator, coffee pot, 2 burner stove top, microwave, sink, stocked with utensils, dinner ware, pots and pans. I bought bleach to wash down the items I used ~ just to be safe. A Publix is about 2 miles away and I bought groceries there. The Studio 6 is set off the road it was quieter and I didn't hear \"road noise\". Easy to find because it's landmarked by Old Town which is across the road and McDonalds that is at entrance to the motel. It was close enough to WDW (average 6-7 miles) theme parks that several times I left and returned to eat lunch in the room. Like I said I was on a tight budget. I drove my car and had no trouble getting around Kissimmee to get to WDW. The swimming pool area was clean and never busy. Staff watered and fertilized the flowers/plants, so it was well landscaped. Any staff I met were very helpful and friendly. Pets are welcome for a $10 nightly fee, so I brought my spoiled rotten Chihuahua. You will see lots of dogs \"visiting\" the dog walking area.

I searched online several times to find information about this hotel and came up with nothing. (Which is why I requested Tripadvisor add it to their site, so I could post a review and some pics!)This was our first trip to Disney and although it would have been nice to stay on property, it wasn't in the budget. I was looking for a reasonably priced hotel, nothing fancy, but CLEAN!! So, I finally decided I would take my chances. The hotel ended up being exactly what I was looking for. It's your basic, run of the mill, room with the added bonus of a kitchenette. The kitchenette had a full size fridge, microwave, toaster, coffee pot and 2 burner cook top stove. It was furnished with dishes for 3 (which I thought was a bit strange, you'd think they would have had 4), pans, utensils and 2 sets of kitchen towels. There was a Target Greatland and 2 Wal-Mart Supercenters within 5 minutes from the hotel. So, it's convenient to pick up food items. (The Wal-Mart also had discount tickets to all the attractions and some souvenir items!!) Everything in the room was clean. We booked the room with a weekly rate and were advised that the rooms are only cleaned once during that week. We spent minimal time in the room, so this wasn't an issue for us. (We mainly needed a place to sleep and shower!) However, clean towels (bath & kitchen) are available at the front desk. We had no issues with security. Our belongings were left untouched during the stay. They did have safes in the lobby that could be rented (not sure of the price). The hotel sits back a bit off of the road, so it was quite. Though, some friends that stayed (we had a total of 5 rooms) said they could hear the TV from the next room through their wall. The pool was also clean. Very refreshing after a long day at the parks. There were several tables and lounge chairs, an outdoor shower to rinse off, and restrooms. We stayed at the parks until closing and then swam when we returned. The pool hours were supposed to be 9-9, but the card key reader worked all the time. We were in the pool at 10, 11, 12 .... However, the pool is only about 50 yards or so from the rooms, so we kept the noise down. All in all this was a great place to stay for the price. I really enjoyed the kitchenette. Though, I refused to do any real cooking - this WAS vacation!! It was very nice to have the fridge, freezer and microwave. Also, it was nice to have access to the pool in the later hours. I liked the location of this hotel. It took approx. 10 mins. to get to and from the Disney parks and there are several restaurants and other activities (go-carts, mini golf, Arabian Nights, Medieval Times, etc...) nearby. Also, if you need a break from the theme parks you can always take an hour or so drive and hang out at the beach for a day.(We went to Clearwater Beach during our stay, approx 1.5 hrs away.)
