Since ten years and multiple trips I stayed in many Rome hotels within the same price range and Margaret was the noisiest I ever had. It is situated on the cross-road of two very busy streets, and there is a traffic starting at 5.30 which is simply unbearable. If you want to know how does it feel to sleep under the bridge of a very busy highway, try Margaret. Moreover the heating is largely unsufficient: it works - sometimes - from 19 up to 22.00 and not in the morning, so you take shower and go out in a chilly room, very comfortable... there are however some bright spots: the hotel is very clean if not spotless, the towels are changed daily, the beds are firm enough, there is a good wi-fi connection. The breakfast is ineventful: you get two types of most basic cereals (but eat as much as you like - I didn't), milk, two very water-diluted juices, one small white bread and one croissant, biscuits, butter and jam. Coffee out of the machine is horrible - shame for Italy - but good Twinnings tea along with awful Lipton Yellow was a nice surprise. One should remember that even if the breakfast is rather untasteful, the most hotels of such a category will provide you with a ticket for a coffee and pastry in nearby bar, and that is, so to have a breakfast in the hotel is a welcome feature. AThe personal is very nice and friendly and you really feel they are genuinly try to do their best to help you but they can't help for the main drawback - noise, noise, noise.

Everything was very clean, we had fresh towels every day and the beds, inclding the additional third bed, were extremely comfortable. Our arrangements did not include breakfast so we cannot comment on the food but a local cafe had good coffee, cakes and marvellous hot chocolate at a very low price. We have two quibbles. One concerned the shower which only provided hot water spasmodically. The other was traffic noise but we did feel that this was probably something which has to be traded in for a central location. The hotel is family run and although the owner speaks only a little English he went to enormous lengths to explain how to get to the places we wanted to see, how to use local transport, where to get coffee and snacks for a good price and, most helpfully, how to avoid pick pockets. He was particularly helpful when one of us tried to change a flight and insisted on telephoning the airport for us.", "Date": "October 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service, Good Location\u201d", "Author": "minnesotagirl0213", "ReviewID": "UR3980073", "Content": "My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Hotel Margaret. The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. We got good coffee and an okay croissant for breakfast each morning. It is located on the 4th floor, but no worries, there is a lift! The hotel is in a good location and within walking distance of almost anything you might want to see during your stay in Rome. We didn't take any busses or taxies except from the airport, walking is the best way to discover the city! If you would rather take the bus though, there is a stop right by the hotel. The train station is very close too. There is a small restaurant across the street called Giovanni's which had excellent food and low prices. We will stay at Hotel Margaret again when we return to Rome.", "Date": "September 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Oswego, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed our stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3605785", "Content": "Run by a wonderful couple, our room was small but very clean and with a new bathroom.
