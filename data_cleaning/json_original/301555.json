If you are coming from the airport you can take the metro at the airport for 4.50 Dirham and change to the green line in Union Square Station. The whole trip will take about 15 minutes. The hotel is an apart hotel by Le Meridien, this means the aparts are only run by Le Meridien , if you want the 5 star comfort of Le Meridien for the apart rates you need a reality check. The apart has a 4* rate for an apartment and although is getting a bit dated is fine. The room is big airy, and consist of a king size bed, a sitting area with a 40 inches flat screen TV. A kitchenette area with an eating bar and chairs, a couple of hoves , microwave, washing machine, fridge, kettle, toaster, and basic pots and pans as well as crockery. Every day they supply you with tea and coffee as well as 2 bottles of water. The bathroom has a bath with an overhead shower and. Is a decent size and provides all the toiletries included proper conditioner besides the normal shampoo and shower gel. I mention this because in all my travels around the world, and having stayed in 5 stars hotels this is the first time that I have a separate conditioning and shampoo. The property is immaculate clean. My room was overlooking the busy road and had a balcony. I did not hear any traffic noise, except for the call to pray. The balcony had a portable washing line, and inside the wardrobe there was an iron board and an iron. The Apart hotel looks exactly as the pictures, has a medium side swimming pool in the roof terrace, with lounges that come with mattresses and they provide courtesy towels. There is a gym a sauna and steam room. There is a business centre in the lobby with 3 computers that you can use free of charge for 45 minutes at a time. Should you need to print anything the only computer connected with the printer is the one in the middle. Around the hotel there are many shopping mall and supermarkets. I found the best one just next door to the hotel, and you can visit the historic places and the creek which is only 10 minutes walk. Please do not confuse with the Creek green line station from the metro. This creek is where you can take the abra boats (120 dirham), or better and cheaper the new air conditioned Dubai ferry (50 dirham) to do a 1 hour cruise around Dubai coast line, including the harbour and Burj Al Arab. The other route cost the same and leaves from the Marina and takes you to Jumeirah and the Palm Island. To summarize the hotel is a very good value for money; the staff is very friendly and efficient. I could not find any post office to send some post cards, the concierge charge me only for the price of the stamps and sent a card to the post office. Even better that the post cards just arrived to the UK.! , the location is great to discover the real Dubai and is very safe, I was a woman on my own and even I walked to the metro at 5:30 in the morning to go to the airport to catch my flight back.

They will put a baby cot inside the room, when asked. The only minor minus is that there is no wifi in the rooms. (but there is a business center which you can use free of charge) Please dont confuse it with a Le Merdien Hotel and dont compare to that sort of standards.

Plus the Dubai buses serve the Deira central frequently. This makes the location perfect for exploring all of Dubai, not merely its beaches. As for the hotel, it is an all suite hotel, thus rooms come with a seating area, kitchenette & sizeable bathroom (with bidet, spray & loo roll, depending on preference).

Free Wi Fi makes another bonus, though it is only free in the lobby restaurant; printing is possible free of charge in the business center.

If you are looking for a touristy luxury hotel and want to be close to the new skyscrapers, etc. this hotel is not for you. I always prefer the old, more historic/cultural parts of a city, so this hotel was exactly what I was looking for. I was one of the few tourists walking around Bur Dubai (especially in early morning and evening), so you get to see a glimpse of real Dubai life you won't get in the newer parts. I am a 25 year old female and was traveling alone, and I felt completely comfortable and safe walking around alone (even at night). I didn't get any of the unwelcome attention that's sometimes typical of the less touristy parts of big cities. The staff at the hotel were extremely welcoming, helpful and kind throughout my stay, and my room was clean, spacious and very comfortable. I also thought it was a very unique, cool experience to hear the call to prayer before sunrise every morning over the mosque tower speakers. This hotel is the perfect jumping off point to explore Bur Dubai souqs, Dubai Creek and Deira, as well as a short walk to the Metro to go down to new Dubai.

I found that the hotel does a disservice to the Le Meridien and Starwood brands and quality is not competitive with other Dubai hotels that have similar standard rates. Overall, the hotel comes across as undistinguished from the budget end of the Bur Dubai/Deira market (i.e. non-brand, low-cost). However, when you are look at this hotel at its usual rates and with the expectations of an established chain then you may be disappointed. Despite having pre-booked my room and prepaid the stay in full to ensure my preferences would be available for a late evening check-in, when I arrived no non-smoking rooms were available. The check-in clerk then tried to offload a twin double-bed room instead of a king (clearly not a benefit when travelling solo). My keycards also expired (without warning) after only two nights - an unnecessary inconvenience. Although I had not asked to extend my stay, on the morning of my scheduled check-out, I found a note stuck in the door telling me that I could not stay as they had overbooked. So I did not find the service welcoming. The room was spacious enough and with plenty of natural light (windows on two sides), but with an odd, apparently unplanned, layout - half a dozen different sets of light switches scattered around the room, some unconnected, another with wires protruding, and neither of the bed-side lamps had working switches. Insulation was less than is typical for buildings (particularly hotels) in Dubai - the room was warm when I arrived, despite the relatively moderate outdoor temperatures in January, so I would worry about how it would cope later in the year. The thermostat was also showing a \"low battery\" indicator. The other effect of the limited insulation was the noise levels - I was woken regularly by traffic. Similarly, you can hear every word of the calls to prayer from the mosque down the road, whether you want to wake up at dawn or not. When not bring woken by the ambient noise, the hotel's fire alarm went off intermittently throughout one of the three nights I stayed there. As a studio suite, there was a two-ring electric stove and microwave, one set of tableware and a few utensils (with some missing). Similarly, an ironing board was provided but the iron was missing. In the bathroom, the toilet flush mechanism was broken (although they did try to fix this, it fell apart again within a day). The room showed signs of having been hastily cleaned, with some dirty mop marks on the floor. On the positive side, despite being a smoking room, there was no obvious odour. The hotel is located within walking distance (about 600m) of the newly-opened Metro green line and a similar distance from the historic sites. There are numerous supermarkets nearby and it makes sense to either shop there and cook in the room, or to go out to eat. The hotel offers food and other supplementary services (internet, etc.) at Le Meridien rates, but not at Le Meridien quality. In terms of facilities, there are three PCs in the lobby \"business centre\", of which two were functional during my stay, albeit with time limits on their usage. The printer was not working. The gymnasium and pool are standard fare - a few pieces of equipment and a small pool, but on the plus side the gym is open 24-hours a day.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nagpur, India", "Title": "\u201cNot a starwood property!\u201d", "Author": "jatintar", "ReviewID": "UR123140848", "Content": "This does not befit a starwood property at all. We stayed here for 6 nights. Also BEWARE of checking in early as there is a 100 Dhiram extra charge for coming before 3 pm. There is also an extra charge of 275 Dhirams for checking out late but this extra charge allows you to stay till 7 pm. 1) Rooms: The rooms are very average with stained floors. The rooms need renovation very badly and the bedding needs to be replaced along with the linen. The flooring is vitrified/ ceramic tiles and you can hear noises from upper floors. 2) Room service and cleaning service: Very poor. The coffee shop that provides you the breakfast service has only one attendant on duty in the evening. If that attendant is serving some room there is no one to pick up your phone for the order. The room cleaning service is good but the minute you ask something after your room is cleaned you will have to wait hours. We asked for a couple of tissue boxes as the cleaning service had not replaced the finished boxes and have waited for hours and hours to get this. 3) Breakfast: Breakfast is average with salad, fruits, some Indian dishes along with bacon and sausages. Sometimes baked beans are given and generally speaking there are about 6 dishes in all other than salad and fruits. 4) Reception: The people are quite friendly and moderately polite. Overall, I would say that this is NOT A STARWOOD HOTEL. For anyone who has stayed in a level 3 starwood hotel and above should avoid staying here. The reason is that over time we have started to expect a very high quality of things from starwood hotels and people will be quite dissappointed to see that this hotel is not upto a starwood standard hotel at all.

The double bed was soft and cozy enough for a good night's sleep. The apartment has an iron and ironing board. The TV had some 30 odd channels (mostly international but not too many in English). The bathroom was modern and clean, and toiletries were supplied regularly. Our balcony faced the main road and looked into a residential-seeming building on the opposite side. There's a mosque very close to the hotel, so if you're a light sleeper, you might wake up with the prayer call at 5.30 am on the loudspeaker. The breakfast spread had a good variety, from the usual toast, cereal, juices, fruit, eggs, jams, to some Indian items as well, because a lot of guests are Indians. The hotel is located on Al Rolla street, about 10 mins walking from the famous Mina Bazaar area on one side and the Dubai creek part from where you'd get an abra to go to old Dubai. It's a bit of a walk to get to the main road but the walk is safe even at night. As someone else mentioned, getting a taxi may sometimes be a problem. But we never had to wait too long to find one. The staff was especially friendly and caring; on the 3rd day of my trip, I had an accident and had to receive 7 stitches on my face; the staff always enquired about my health on the remaining days of the trip; check-in and check-out were smooth.

Noise same throughout the night. Try to report first thing in morning, seems like phone system diverted. Went down to reception and report. To their credit within 10 minutes Maintenance guy attends says it air-con problem (I try to explain it happens when Air-con is switched off. They advise problem will be fixed after 9am. Meanwhile second guy comes to the room hears the noise and says its pigeons nesting. I returned to the hotel late that evening and reception confirm problem fixed 'all ok'. I ask what problem was \u2013 'don't know sir'. No sign of any ceiling tiles etc having been removed. Have doubts anyone came during the day. Throughout the night same problem and no sleep. Next morning I go down and get Duty manager. Maintenance guys work on the problem and strip down the hot-water system. Engineers very helpful. Noise now only slight. I ask what was done the day before 'not sure', probably code for nothing! At last a night's sleep. Thus far (5 days) no one from hotel bothered to check with me if all now working ok or offer any kind of gesture/apology. Wrote email complaint. After couple of days I catch Duty Manager and ask if he got my email (sent to email address as per business card) 'no I've not seen it. Send me copy to xxxx email address'. Copy email duly sent and rejected by Starwood's web-host as address doesn\u2019t exist. No response to copy sent to 'Reservations'. I had been due to have checked out earlier but extended my stay (at higher cost due too late notice) in order to catch-up on some sleep. Maybe there was a hope I'd just check-out and ignore the inconvenience. Handed hotel reception staff a further copy of my complaint at check-out. Kettle didn't work, toaster didn't work (2 days to replace it), slippers two days to supply, electric shock from the Iron, wc so loud surprised other guests didn't complain, cracked floor tiles around pool, asked reception for sharp knife and sewing kit said would send. Never arrived. None of these items in isolation matter but combined, and on the back of 2 nights lost sleep, give the impression of quickly declining standards. So much so I asked staff if the hotel was being closed down as it seems to have been run down past few months.

The rooms are clean and spacious with enough space for three people (two queen size beds and one single) plus room for seating, TV, desk and kitchen area. The bathrooms are clean and well maintained. The hotel is dry (no alcohol licence) and the restaurant menu is limited, but still good value. There is a swimming pool on the roof which never seems to be crowded. The pool area is clean and well serviced. The views of the city from here are great, especially at night when you can see the modern skyscrapers on Sheik Zayhed Road all lit up. Whenever we have stayed here we have booked rooms on the business club floors which gives us access to the business lounge area and includes breakfast and complimentary snacks & drinks during the day. The business lounge also has a couple of PCs that you can use to access the internet. The business lounge is on the floor just below the swimming pool, so getting snacks & drinks while sunbathing is easy! There is a small gym with weights and a few machines, but we have never used it. It looks like it is well maintained. The staff are generally polite and helpful, but do not kid yourself that you are staying in a five star resort; they are not going to be able to organis a tourist itinerary for you! Wifi, like in most hotels in Dubai, is extra and slow. The location is not great - there are some local restaurants nearby and a supermarket, but that is about it. However, it only a fifteen minute walk through old Dubai to the Creek. The shops between the hotel and the Creek can be great for bargain hunting. If you want to go drinking and partying you will need to get a taxi. Sometimes, getting a taxi from the hotel can be a bit of a problem as the hotel is off the main streets.

There is also a Carrefour store approx. 10 mins away with affordable food. The kitchen facilities are a bit minimal but when we asked them to get the missing items and also asked for a knife to cut vegetables they quickly did so. We bought a sieve and some mugs as we felt these were necessary. I'd recommend that you bring a travel washing line if you want to use the washing machine as it isn't a tumble dryer and we struggled to find places to dry our clothes.

The room was a studio suite and was huge and very comfortable, with a kitchen and living room area. The furnishings were basic and the floors were tile, but that was fine with me. My only complaint about the room was that the water in the shower never got more than just warm. The bathroom had an individual water heater that needed to be turned on prior to showering, and even though I did that the water never really got hot. The hotel is centrally located, and great for sightseeing. It's about a 15 minute walk to Dubai Creek so you can take an abra ride across to Deira. The beach areas are about 30 mins in a cab so I wouldn't recommend this hotel for a beach vacation. However the roof top pool at the hotel is very nice and has a great view. The new metro system also makes getting around convenient. The hotel isn't that close to a metro stop but you can take a quick cab ride to get there.

Not the case. Now, let me preface this with saying I am a bit of a diva and expect a lot from any Starwood hotel. My husband and I were spending the 2nd leg of our honeymoon in Dubai. As we were nearing the hotel, I knew we were not heading in the right direction. The building is old, it is not in the tourist section, and your view will be either construction of a parking garage or people drying laundry out of their window. The room was just short of disgusting. I am used to Sheraton Sweet Sleepers/Westin Heavenly Beds, etc so when I saw the flat, polyester, yellowing bed I really did want to vomit. No new pillows, no down comforter, no sheets without stains. The \"suite\" is equal to a suite at an old Holiday Inn...not the new ones. The bathroom was tiny, with a narrow tub. The TV was an old 20\" set. No flat screens here. I thought everything in Dubai was supposed to be new and shiny. This, my friend, was not. The room caused my new husband and I to get in a huge fight because I asked if we could switch hotels. I went up to the pool to cool off, it is small and decent. But you would expect a roof-top pool to have a cool view...there is a 4 ft fence wrapping the roof, ruining any view you may have had. I returned to the room to find my husband had decided I was too high-maintenance and locked me out. I debated moving to the Le ROYAL Meridien or The Grovesnor House or any of the other actual NICE hotels in the Jumeriah Beach area. These were going for about $300 USD a night and would have been well worth it. The only problem was that I did not feel comfortable at all being a woman alone in the city. I had to walk down the street to change money at Western Union and felt the heavy stares on men on me. I turned my wedding ring inside out! All of the temples have loud speakers and they blast prayers to the entire city several times a day. I found this to be a bit Big Brother. The doorman was extremely nice and helpful. The desk staff was not as nice and helpful. You will need to change your money for Dubai, all prices are in their own currency. The weather was a lot cooler than we expected. It seemed to be high 60s low 70s and it rained some days. Not really beach weather. I ended up grabbing a cab and heading back to the airport. Like a previous reviewer, I was supposed to stay 5 nights, but due to this hotel, I didn't stay 1 night. I booked the next flight back to JFK, but word to the wise.....you are not allowed to go through security until 3 hours before your flight, and there are no restaurants or shops or anything on the outside. I slept on a chair for 5 hours. The flight from JFK to Dubai was nice and on a new Emirates plane. We had the row to ourselves and got free kits and all. The flight back was on an older plane and was packed. Not empty seats anywhere. I had a screaming (and kicking) baby behind me for 14 hours. The flight out was only 12 hours. If you are looking for a very budget place to stay and you are a man and you do not want a nice view or a beach, this may be ok. I, personally, was absolutely disgusted, I can't believe Le Meridien put their name on this place. It is one thing if it was a POS place next to all the things you wanted to see....but it was a POS place in the middle of the ghetto.

Breakfast was included in the room rate, which helped keep our food expenses lower than we anticipated. FOOD/DRINK - Don't miss the breakfast buffet. It was wonderful. Try to book a room where breakfast is included in your room rate. This will save you $, although we found local food prices to be fairly reasonable. There is also a small grocery store just 1 block away down the particularly busy street. If you have small children, pay close attn. to them as drivers here will not stop for much. NO BAR in this hotel, so alcohol is nowhere in the building. I was told that a few hotels close-by had restaurants w/ bars, but we were not that motivated to find them. 2 bottles of complimentary water provided each day, which was nice to have at the end of each days' activities upon our return. Complimentary hot snacks were also served at the end of the day. Choice was thin, but food was good. SERVICE - The service we received was a SOLID 4 star and more than made up for the 3 star facilities. They understand good service here and are most responsive to any request or call to the front desk. (Upon checkin to the room, we realized the safe was locked. After calling, maintenance arrived in under 5 minutes and fixed it.) LOCATION - Not the best location for Dubai, but taxis are so cheap, one can get anywhere inexpensively. Watch the street here, as it is quite busy. Probably not the best location if you have children, but was more than functional if you don't plan on staying in the hotel's immed. vicinity. (Our small family went to Wild Wadi and Mall of the Emirates over 2 days, so the location was not all that important to us). TAXIS ARE CHEAP, so don't let this location keep you from staying here. POOL - We used it several times. Very functional. Tiles in the pool area were not made for poolside use as they are very slick when wet. Great view from the rooftop/pool area of the Bur Dubai, when it's not too dusty. Fresh towels provided at the pool area. Again, the pool attendant was friendly and we enjoyed our quiet peaceful time relaxing and catching some sun at the pool. ROOMS - Well appointed and comfortable. We got exactly what we paid for. No surprises when we checked in. NO FUNKY HOTEL SMELL, as is often the case in so many places. The hotel's website gave us advanced notice that there was construction going on beside our hotel - We really appreciated the warning, but happy to report that they basically worked during normal work hours, so it did not inconvenience us at all. As is the case in much of Dubai, construction work is going on practically everywhere, so do not be surpised if you encounter construction noise regardless of your hotel choice in Dubai. Comfy bed, nice bathroom, but not huge. Everything was functional. No place to plug in hot water pot for coffee/tea, but this was solved with one quick call to maintenance, who promptly responded w/ in 5 minutes with a converter. OVERALL - The people make all the difference at the Dar al Sondos Hotel Apartments. As an american expat traveling w/ my wife and 4 yr. old son, this hotel was just fine for our needs. Daytime activities took us out of the hotel most of the day, and upon our return, it was more than comfortable and quite affordable. Wouldn't call it a \"great deal for the money\", but would say that we were generally happy with our experience based on the rate that we paid. I would recommend this hotel to western expats venturing to Dubai for their first trip, esp. if you don't want to spend a lot of $ to just get out and explore this exciting/vibrant city for a few days.", "Date": "May 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place !!\u201d", "Author": "Mum_and_me", "ReviewID": "UR15120151", "Content": "We arrived at approx 3am from Cairo and were greated with hot towels and juice at reception !!!

We came to Dubai due to family friends having a wedding blessing at the Ritz-Carlton. I work as a Travel Agent and did some thorough searching for hotel that would suit us aswell as not spending a complete fortune (accommodation in dubai can be really expensive) especially as we were staying longer than all the guests. I found this fantastic priced hotel & checked up on TripAdvisor for all the reviews. When we eventually got to the hotel, i realised I had looked at the wrong hotel..! There was absolutely nothing to worry about, as soon as we pulled up outside the hotel, the consierge was waiting there, opened doors, took lugagge into the reception. Reception staff were so so friendly, we were handed a drink and damp towels to wipe down due to the heat. We arrived a couple of hours before the check-in time, no problem at all, got a room straight away and even upgraded to a corner apartment on floor 3. Rooms :- The apartment was fairly big, the usual essentials.. kitchenette with microwave, hob etc. Queen sized bed, air con worked very well. T.v had lot's of english/american channels. We had a problem with the shower not working, one phone call down to reception, someone was right up and sorted it within 5mins. The balconies are quite small, however, i'd rather have one that not have one at all. Location :- Meridien Al Sondos is in Bur Dubai, the more suburban area of Dubai. We did have to take taxi's to most places. Most nights we went to the Hard Rock Cafe (you must go there!!) it cost roughly 50 dirhams one way. There are restaurants and a shopping centre just down the road. Supermarkets to buy your essentials just 2 min walk. Food :- We ordered alot of Room Service and the food was gorgeous. We had breakfast included in the holiday price, we only got up twice during the stay to have breakfast as you only have a certain time to between to get it. Breakfast was okay, but we prefered the room service. Facilities :- the pool is on the roof top which is great for catching some rays. quite small but efficient. there's always someone on watch incase theres any mischief going on, or for the children. Internet connection very slow but it works! The gym is brilliant, all the new gadgets not that I done any grafting, just had a little peek. Service :- Fantastic, everyone was so helpful. If you need anything they help you out straight away. If you need a taxi, you just sit and wait and the consierge will grab one for you.

This apparthotel is owned by a local company but managed by Meridien, part of the Starwood group. Essentially it is just like an hotel, with the facilities and service you would normally expect, but with the addition of modest kitchen facilities in the rooms. It is well situated in Bur Dubai, with free secure parking if you have a hire car, or reasonably placed for passing taxis if you don't. It is a short (5 minutes) taxi ride up to Trade Centre Road from where you can get anywhere, or down to Dubai museum and the Creek, or across to Deira by the tunnel. Personally I think Bur Dubai is the best base for independent visitors to Dubai who are not looking for the luxury and cost of 5 star beach hotels. All the front of house staff were very friendly and helpful. We had a one bedroom appartment which consists of a large room, with a small kitchen area and a breakast bar at one end, a sofa and chair in the middle and a large king sized double bed at the other end of the room. It was clean and well equipped, although a little short of shelves in the wardrobes. The room was cleaned every day and fresh towls provided. We had a room on one of the executive floors so breakfast was included in the room price. The free breakfast is served (for executive rooms) on the top floor adjacent to a well equipped fitness centre and a sauna. It was excellent with a wide choice of cereals, juices, fresh fruit, cold cuts, cheese and a hot buffet. There is a restaurant on the ground floor, but we did not use it so can not comment. The hotel does not have a bar. Because we were there at the time of the Dubai air show we had to pay full rack rate, but even this we thought was good value-for-money for Dubai.

There was no breakfast in our cheap price but we did all our cooking in the room which saved a lot of money. The neighborhood was working class and no one seemed to sleep around here. We could go looking for food and groceries anytime day or night. If course, crime is pretty much non-existent in this city so we felt safe walking anywhere, anytime. Just watch out for the bad drivers. The pool was nice. It is surround by a bunch of Europeans turning brown and no one seemed to actually swim. It was cold but why heat it when no one swims? Reception was nice enough. We managed to figure out the bus system so took the bus to the airport. I think the airport shuttle was no longer offered by the hotel. One couple was going to the airport on the same day and we heard them told by staff that two hours before the flight was plenty of time for calling a cab. With the hellish traffic we thought that sounded tight. Hopefully the couple made it. We would give at least an hour to drive there and two hours for the airport.

The room service is always excellent and there is also a great little Indian restaurant across the street.

No horrible mattresses, no cigarette packs behind TV (i checked!),etc. The negatives would be: 1. except for CNN and one other channel, there was nothing on tv except for Arabic channels which is a problem for non Arabs.. anyways, it didn't matter as we were outside mostly. 2. The mini bar is very very expensive.. dare not touch! 3. They don't give you bottled water through room service which was quite funny, you need to tag a mineral water carton along! The good things surpassed the negatives though! I am recommending this hotel to all my friends who are budget travellers like me.. and if you have a little one .. bingo! Dubai is a wonderful to place to be in too , so people who dont stick around too much at the hotel should find this stay cheap and fulfilling.", "Date": "January 23, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Dar Al Sondos Hotel Apartments by Le Meridien", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d301555-Reviews-Dar_Al_Sondos_Hotel_Apartments_by_Le_Meridien-Dubai.html", "Price": "$71 - $172*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Bur Dubai Rolla Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">113562</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "301555", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/be/69/be69894fb66c48c282c2c405a60143a491large.jpg"}}
