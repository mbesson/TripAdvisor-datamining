This will be my last stay there. It was VERY disappointing. I was in the room 3 minutes, went to slide the bathroom door open and the handle fell off in my hand! The carpet has stains all over it, looking very dirty. I asked for an in room fridge like I had last stay. I was told they would see what they could do. They never responded back. There is a \"cooler\" in the room that looks like a fridge, but it barely cools water. Its not meant for food. The housekeeping staff is terrible. I had to keep calling the desk for bars of soap and shampoo when they were low/out because it was never refilled. this happened 3 times in the 8 days I was there. The same for the in room coffee. I had to call daily. I KNOW the carpet was not vacuumed, because things on the floor when I went out in the morning were still there at night upon my return. As a Silver member, I am supposed to get a newspaper at my door daily. I got it two days, even after complaining. The restaurant slipped downward as well...see separate review. The shower head was mediocre and no longer adjustable.

Everything so clean and new it looks like you are the first person ever using it. Staff: Great. The Valet was quick, efficient everytime we pulled in or out. Bellman was friendly, taking time to show us the room features. Housekeeping staff was only 'glitch' in our stay. We called down for a blanket around 5pm and within 45min housekeeping knocked on door with sheets and extra pillows but no blanket. Asked about the blanket and was told they didn't have any at that time as they were in the process of being washed. Housekeeping said they would be back later with blanket so we tipped at that tipped since we were leaving for dinner. And wouldnt be in room when she returned. No blanket ever came. Honestly, this did not tarnish our stay or likely hood of returning, a simple glitch in a. Perfect experience. Location: awesome. Adjacent to the convention center. Tram depot 1minute walk.

Everyone thought I was crazy and everyone told me I could not get a decent room or pay at least $300 a night on a sleezy hotel. Well, I wanted to prove family wrong and was glad I was able to do that with the help of Marriott Rewards Membership. I booked rooms at this hotel the very same day we are checking in for a little over $100 a night, that's gov't employee rate by the way. Location - 3.5 stars. About few blocks from the strip. Right next to the convention center. Few minutes walk to the monorail system, $12 for an old day pass if you prefer not to drive around town. We used this system to beat the holiday (New Years eve weekend) rush. This hotel is situated in a clean, well lit and safe neighborhood. Lobby - 4 stars. Spacious with comfortable and updated furnitures. There's a warm, open and inviting feel to it. They have a bar setup in the middle for a quick drink or bite, and a conveniet albeit expensive steakhouse restaurant in the back. There's another small cafe on the right end corner, which is again convenient yet somewhat pricey. I'm one who would pay for convenience sake so the price was not much of an issue to me. Room - 4 stars. A good size room with clean and updated furnitures, LCD TV w/ gaming system, mini fridge and etc. The bed was comfortable. Sheets top quality. Doubled curtain that keeps the room dark for those who want to sleep in. Sound proofing in our room was also adequate. The bathroom was clean and new. Our bathroom was LIKE-NEW and no molds. Plus, the shower is totally separate from the tub. We never had clogging issue here. In fact, my toddler had a bubble bath in the tub with no issues. The water drained swiftly when unplugged. The tub was shiny clean - I would not let my son have a bubble bath in a dirty tub! Parking - 5 stars. They have a complimentary valet parking. Very rare to find this kind of complimentary service in any hotel nowadays. Parking usually runs $12-$25/daily. So even if you tip the valet attendants, it's still a steal. Services - 5 stars. The host/hostess who checked us in was very friendly and professional. There was a lot of people lining up to check in but they were very efficient. They did not look frazzled considering all the guest arriving to check in all at the same time. It was the New Years eve weekend afterall. They look like they have everything under control and they did; gracing us with sincere smiles at the same time. Another rarity nowadays. A big thank you to Mika, who accommodated my request and gave us a room that is overlooking the Vegas strip. So during new years celebration, we just opened the curtain and enjoyed the entire fireworks. We woke up our toddler to experience the fireworks and he was truly ecstatic to see all the lights - without the anxiety of the over blaring/loud sounds. Pool - 4 stars. Smartly designed outdoor pool (heated) and jacuzzi. I decided to take my son to see their pool area one chilly evening so I bundled him up. However upon entering the poolside, I noted that the temperature seemed nice and warm all over the area, despite it being outdoor. And this is because they have plenty of heatlamps all over the pool area - cleverly placed, I might add. This made the area consistently warm in addition to the heated pool. Had I known this beforehand, I would have had my son and I dip in their pool. But alas, it was our last night and we did not bring any swimwear. Who would have thought to take a toddler swimming in an outdoor pool during winter time. So now, you know... Another added bonus: This hotel have a NON-SMOKING POLICY and there is no casino in the premises. This can be a disadvantage to others but if you have kids and want a quiet, peaceful hotel in Las Vegas, then this one is definitely for you.

We have stayed in many of the other Vegas strip hotels on countless other trips over the years. We will just break this review into what we liked and did not like about this hotel and some tips: What we liked: 1. Location, location, location. OMG, you cannot be closer to the monorail station and it's also roll out of bed into the convention center if you have business there. We have stayed at the Hilton before, it's close also, but you will get on to the monorail and into the convention center fastest staying here. 2. 100% NON-SMOKING Hotel. Hopefully one day all hotels will be 100% non-smoking but until people's personal fires are completely out, we have to cherish places like the Renaissance. They will kick your Buttola and charge you hundreds if you dare light up anywhere in this hotel. We love that! 3. It's clean, modern, and easy to get into and out. 4. Free easy close, large parking garage. Park, lock, and in minutes you are in bed. 5. Very professional and responsive staff. When we made a room request, it was completed fast. 6. Great Large Flat Screen LCD TV's What we did not like: 1. NO FULL LENGTH MIRRORS anywhere. The only mirror was over the recessed sink. You had to back yourself out the door of the bathroom to see your entire body and you were far away from the mirror with feet cut off. 2. NO close mirrors in the bathroom. The one mirror is recessed behind the sink like a wall painting and to shave or apply makeup or put contacts in we were breaking our backs leaning over the sink to get as close as we can to the mirror. Can't you put another mirror in there? 3. Haphazard maid service. These are the things in life that I wish had a rational explanation for: One day we have 4 bath towels, 2 wash cloths, 2 bars of soap, 2 shampoos, & 2 glasses. We use them all. We leave for the day, maid makes up room, we get back later and we have just 2 fresh bath towels, 1 washcloth, no bars of soap, no shampoo, and 1 glass. Call down to front desk: 10 minutes later we have lots of supplies. But what happened that it was necessary to make that call? It was NYE weekend and we were having a good time so we moved on\u2014it\u2019s okay. Tips: 1. There are generally 3 main views from this hotel: Pool View which also gives you a view of the parking garage; Monorail/Strip/Wynn Hotels view; Hilton/Convention Center view. The rooms with a Strip view go first. We had a pool view and it was fine. 2. Windows in the rooms do not open. 3. If you like to watch your car in the garage, ask for a pool view facing the garage and park on the 4th or 5th floor and you will be able to activate your car alarm from your room window it\u2019s that close and direct. 4. Bring food and water. There are no doubt vending machines, but no restaurants or services close by\u2014they have a little store with limited items and hours\u2014it\u2019s not a Strip hotel. Be prepared. 5. This is not a happening Vegas pool hotel.

During my three days of staying, the lobby was a mess and chaotic so I would suggest you check first if this kind of gathering bothers you. If I had known, I would have picked a different hotel. Hotel room \u2013 I was a bit disappointed with the room compared with other Renaissance hotels around the world. Considering this is Vegas hotel, it could do more with the room decoration. Bathroom \u2013 It was a good sized bathroom with a separate shower booth which was desirable preference. Club Lounge \u2013 It was closed throughout my stay so did not have an opportunity to experience it Room cleanness - It was poor at best. The room cleaning did not occur until 5 PM when we returned on the first day and housekeeping was still inside when we showed up. Considering we left the room at 10 AM, I expected the room already cleaned. Used glasses were left inside of the bathroom even after cleaning. Second cleaning, just for the hell of it, I\u2019ve left a $5 dollar tip but the same spotty cleaning. I did not leave a tip for housekeeping when I checked out which is rare. Food \u2013 We did eat breakfast at the restaurant and on Christmas day, food was not good at all. The following day, it was much, much better so we figured that main chef was taking the Christmas day off. Lobby \u2013 The main lobby had some construction going on and also previously mentioned convention throughout our stay. Muslim gathering of some sort and there were so many people all day long and very noisy. Another thing that drove me nuts was elevator due to the people attending convention. I was on the top floor and it would stop on every floor to let people in and out. I understand hotel can\u2019t do much on this but it drove me nuts. Every morning, each convention attendees were carrying two toasts and an egg riding the elevators up and down. Parking \u2013 Valet was quick and free (just few dollar tip) and self-park was easy as well with a plenty of parking space. Location \u2013 This hotel is not on the main strip but rather right behind the Wynn golf course. There is monorail station right next to the hotel so if you are moving by Monorail, this is a plus. Finding a main entrance is somewhat tricky at night since it is hidden from the main road. Overall impression \u2013 Based on my first stay at Renaissance Las Vegas, I probably would not return to this hotel considering so much choice at Vegas. Due to low hotel prices at even at top class hotel, there really is no reason to stay at this hotel. I\u2019ve paid $109 per night and for $30 more, I could have stayed at Aria.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Michele R", "ReviewID": "UR122379600", "Content": "The hotel was wonderful and a great break from all the New Year's Eve madness on the strip.

Accessing the hotel is easy by car and a lot quicker to get in and out of compared to many of the strip or downtown casino hotels where there are numerous stop lights and queues especially at night. The self parking is very easy and takes less than 5 minutes to walk from the top floor of the car park to the lobby, whereas in the some of the large casino hotels you sometimes have at least a 10 to 15 minute walk, valet parking is available if required. The rooms are large with a flatscreen TV with fancy digital TV options, an easy chair, desk and chair; plus a safe and fridge. The bathroom has both a nice large shower and large low level bath. The room I stayed in 1020 had a great view overlooking the Wynn golf course, sunrise relecting onto the distance mountains and the golf was really special and at night you can see the lights of the strip. The staff I found to be all very friendly. For those that may use the concierge lounge, the young lady looking after breakfast was first class.

Note this is not on the strip, but close enough. This hotel was selected as it was an inexpensive option and was away from the 'strip' of Las Vegas. What I mean by that is that there was no casino or smoking in the lobby and was presented as more of a 'business' oriented option. The hotel felt like any other Marriott hotel, nice, but not overwhelming in the Vegas sort of way. The hotel had a restaurant or two on sight and a small pool that was open 24 hours a day. We did not use the restaurants or the pool, so I can't fairly comment on these, but the pool looked nice. We were disappointed by the room service menu and ended up leaving the hotel for most of our meals. However, there was a small fridge in the room to store bottled water or food if purchased, but honestly, I love a well stocked mini bar and that was not to be found in this hotel. The bed was comfortable, the pillow options plentiful, and we appreciated the black-out drapes when we needed to sleep in after a wild night in Vegas. There was a coffee maker with decaf and tea options and an ironing board, iron and hair dryer also in the room. The one complaint I had was that there was no vanity mirror. I do not like having to lean over a bathroom sink and counter top to get close to a mirror to apply my makeup. The other complaint, and I know it sounds like I love mirrors, was that the only full length mirror in the room, was inside of the closet door, which would not stay open. So, in order to get a good look of what I was wearing, I had to stretch out an arm or a foot to keep the door open. I didn't appreciate that. I know, this is not important to most travellers, but these are truly my only complaints about the room. The room was very quiet and we had a wonderful sleep. Housekeeping was friendly.

I would agree with most of the reviews given here. Several caveats I'd mention: we were on the 7th floor facing Paradise Road (rooms with a view of the strip) and the traffic noise was very noticeable, especially early in the morning and the room was very warm from the afternoon sun; I would suggest forgoing the view and getting a room facing east. If you are looking for a tan, the courtyard pool does not get a lot of afternoon sun. We stayed here for two weeks, and here are my pros and cons: Pros: Good size room and bathroom; separate tub and shower with good water pressure. Comfortable bed; bathrobes provided; Aveda toiletries were nice; very friendly and accommodating staff; non-smoking, non-casino hotel; easy walking distance to LVCC; quiet lobby, WSJ, USA today and LV Review Journal provided at bell desk; adequate club level lounge, although nothing special. Cons: spotty housekeeping - I've seen this in many reviews and wonder why management has not addressed the issue; thin walls - you can hear phone conversations next door; outside of the Convention Ctr, there are no restaurants or bars within walking distance; the ironing board had a stained cover with no padding, so my clothes picked up the grid pattern of the ironing board; the rooms are getting \"tired\" looking; smallest refrigerator I've even seen in a hotel room with no temperature control - ours did not keep beverages cold enough; not nearly enough hangers in the armoire. We mostly ate at the bar, which has the same kitchen as Envy, touted as one of the best steakhouses in Vegas. I had an excellent seabass one evening but a collegue ordered the $55 steak that was so pathetically thin, I would have sent it back. I noticed that Envy hasn't received the \"best steakhouse in Vegas award\" for several years now. (Suggest you go down Paradise to Ruth's Chris or Morton's where you get what you pay for.)The flatbreads were good as well as the roasted tomato soup. Blah salads. The other \"restaurant\" in the hotel is the E-Go Cafe which is a counter where you can order simple breakfast, lunch and dinner items from a counter and then sit at a few tables. They made a \"skinny hazelnut latte\" that is better than Starbucks. I had one every morning. The chicken noodle soup I ordered for one lunch was the worst I've ever had, so at best, it is a hit or miss type of place. Overall, for an extended business stay, we settled in and enjoyed the Renaissance.

Facitilites are in very good shape and very well maintained, though it still is a business hotel, so nothing fancy like the main hotels on the strip. No casino on site either. It has a small pool at ground level, several meeting rooms on the second floor and free parking. There's a business center that you can use for a fee. Rooms are in very good shape and spacious. Bathroom is spacious and has a bath tub separated from the shower. My room had a Kingsize bed, a small sofa and LCD TV offering cable service and a small desk for work. Plenty of outlets to plug in my laptop and several charges on the desk. There's a small cafeteria serving snacks (bagels, panini, muffins), coffe and beverages throughout the day. The hotel also has a restaurant that serves breakfast buffet and operates as a stakehouse at nights (Envy Stakehouse). I didn't try it, but it's supposed to be one of the best Stakehouses in Las Vegas. Breakfast Buffet is not \"Vegas style\" buffet, it's more like the typical eggs-station, waffle station, fruit-station kind of service. There's a small executive lounge on the 15th floor that serves complimentary breakfast for guests staying on 14th and 15th floor. Variety is more limited than at the restaurant, but it still served my purposes. Wi-Fi and cable internet is offered at the hotel, but it's not free of charge. It costs around 13 USD per day and it works noon-to-noon, in other words, if you pay to connect in the morning, the service stops at noon, thus you have to pay again if you want to connect again in the afternoon (and it would be valid until noon the next day) and so. Staff is very friendly. I purchased a couple of things in advance and had them sent to the hotel. All my packages were given to me upon checkin with no problem.

On one side, you have the fabulous front desk staff, valet, and bell hop staff. On the other hand you have the housekeeping staff who need a bit of help. The basics have been covered elsewhere, but I will say that this hotel is about a 10 minute walk to the monorail and a $12 cab ride to the main section of the strip. They have a wonderful work out room with 4 elliptical, 5 treadmills and a lot of nautalis equipment. Unfortunately this is offset by the fact that there are only 2 TVs and the workout equipment (other than the treadmills) are not hooked into their audio. The rooms are spacious. Oddly, or wonderfully, they have a separate tub and shower. The tub has no hand-held wand nor shower head (or curtain) so it really is only for soaking. The front desk attendant, Saul, was wonderful. Helping me split the check to keep my accountants happy and helped me print out a boarding pass when the computer crashed and burned on the US air pop-up windows. Vince and his crew of valets were fast and efficient -- just amazing, and friendly. The Tamara, also at the front desk, arranged an amazing and well priced spa day, with no notice. Then there was housekeeping. Our room was missing: hangars (literally none in the closet), the hair dryer and the iron. I'm not sure what caused the previous occupant to remove all of these items, but I felt that housekeeping should have spotted it before we took occupancy, or not taken 30 minutes to scrounge up new ones. The concierge lounge on the 15th floor was nice as always, but it lacked the necessary counter space and thus the poor attendants were run ragged trying to keep up with everyone's \"special\" requests for things like jam and hot water.

Not at all adequate when staying a week for a trade show at the convention center next door. 3) Internet is $19.99 a night PER DEVICE! The Marriott Courtyard across the street is FREE. 4) Food choices are VERY limited. There is only 1 restaurant that has excellent but expensive food and a cafe that is prepackaged food and closes early, leaving only limited room service as an option and no gift shop at all. 5) Breakfast staff and seating was severely limited and understaffed, causing a big back up, a restaurant 2/3 empty/unused and very unhappy guests. 6) I was also given the wrong room (supposed to be 15th floor city view), got 11th floor backside and had to remind them that I also had concierge suite access which they also forgot. 7) Newspapares were very tough to come by if not impossible most days. 8) Could use more accessable outlets for charging phone and other devices. On the plus side: 1) Overall, the staff was excellent, especially the ladies in teh concierge suite and the valet's outside. Always greeted with a smile, often by name and genuinely warm. 2) Hotel is next to the South Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center.

We had a room on the 14th floor (14th and 15th floors are the club levels with the lounge on the 15th). The view from our room was nothing special; it over looked the parking garage and was opposite of the strip. Our room was nice, a little on the smaller side for a Marriott, but same/typical clean Marriott design. My big complaint was the bathroom. It was all one room with a sliding pocket door with no lock. There was one sink. There was a separate tub and shower and the shower was clear glass box. If you are staying alone, then the bathroom would be fine, but otherwise if you are trying to share the bathroom you have little privacy. Friday morning we were awoken by an alarm of some sort. We looked all around the room trying to find it before realizing that it was from the room next door, but sounded like it was in our room...so the walls are a little thin. The club lounge on the 15th floor was nice, but closes at 10am on Friday, so we didn't have much time to take advantage of it since we arrived on a Thursday. The plus for me, was that they had glass bottles of coke available (and I've found that most marriotts only carry pepsi). We had breakfast in the lounge on Friday morning. There was an employee at the door checking peoples names before letting us in, which we found odd. The breakfast choices were minimal at best. It was also very crowded at the time we were there. We didn't use the pool, but you can't help but see it because it is in the middle of the hotel and conference area with huge glass windows. Unfortunately, the sun only hits about half of the pool area, so there is a lot of shade, plus a lack of privacy due to all of the windows surrounding it. The front desk staff was great and the valets were friendly. There is complimentary valet parking and free self parking available as well. There is a small area that sells coffee, snacks, muffins, etc. in the hotel as well as a steakhouse, but we didn't eat at either. The walk to the monorail station would take 2-3 minutes. There is a McDonalds down the street (maybe a 5-7 minute walk), but that is the only other food close by and I wouldn't have wanted to walk there out in the full sun. This hotel is definitely not on the strip and isn't in walking distance of the strip. There is also a lot of road construction between the hotel and the strip, but traffic was always moving. It was nice to come back to this hotel after being on the strip because it didn't have a casino. It was a nice break from the smoky casinos. The Las Vegas convention center is literally right next door to this hotel, so if your conference is there or at this hotel, then this is a great place to stay. My husband's conference was at the Rio and a cab ride to the Rio was $16 before the tip.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "nashville, tennessee", "Title": "\u201cNice Enough and Not Too Expensive\u201d", "Author": "pickitravelerNash", "ReviewID": "UR116264889", "Content": "My husband stayed at this property for work for several days in late July, and I flew to LV and stayed with him for two nights.

If this construction were not there, walking to the strip may be more feasible. The parking is fine, and my husband told me it was free, although I'm not sure if this is for all guests or just gold/platinum card holders. The biggest disappointment was the pool. While the pool and lounge areas of the pool are nice, the pool is located in an interior courtyard of the hotel and can be seen through large glass windows/doors from the lobby, and it appeared from some of the rooms. It was surrounded and shaded by the large brick walls of the hotel, and pool goers are prancing around for all to see (although there were not many people at the pool when we were there). I also saw several people smoking in thepool area. I assume this was being done since it was outdoors.

My wife had a convention so it's location was very convienent....right next to the LV conference center. And it was nice that it was not a casino, quiet. We stayed 3 nights. Unfortunately there were many things that were just not right. First of all we arrived at 11:15 a.m.. We did not expect to be able to check in so early. The check in lady was very nice. Timarra I believe. She told us to come back at 3 and see if our room was ready. After that, we stood in line for 20 minues to check our bags at the bell desk. One guy there to check in a long line with many people with many bags. At one point another bellman showed up and asked the lone bellman if he needed help. He declined, much to the disappointment of all of us standing in line that heard the offer. What was he thinking? We finally left our bags and went to the strip to check things out. We came back at 3:15 and stood in another long line to see if our room was ready. A gentleman named Yousef rather curtley and with a bit of arrogance said that our room was not ready yet. When asked when it would be, he told us to check back in awhile. No offer of a call or anything. In other words, stand in another long line to find out for the third time. Went back an hour later to find out that we could have 2 double beds now, but it would be \"about\" 2 hours more for a king siz bed. We took the doubles. Housekeeping is apparently a major issue with this property. They are seriously understaffed, especially for a not so big hotel. First of all the first day maid service hadn't been around by 4 p.m.. I went down the hall and asked the maid when she'd be by to clean our room. She said would clean it next. We left and by 5 it was cleaned. Then for 2 days in a row, she only left one wash cloth, even after having left a note for her to leave two the next day. I tried to call the front desk but the phone between the two beds didn't work! I didn't realize there were 2 phones in the room however. The other one worked. The bathroom floor was never mopped once the whole time. It was pretty obvious if you know what I mean. There was also a huge stain at the foot of one of the beds. They had a refridgerator and that was nice, but the rubber seal around the door was coming off so if you didn't push it back on the door it didn't keep things cool. We found out that one the hard way. We were there for almost 4 days and the 6th floor hallway carpets were never vacuumed once! I know this because I saw the same debris on the floor the last day that I saw on the first day. What's up with that? Then there's the pool. It's a nice small pool. Problem was that it was not clear...it was rather murky. You could see the bottom, but it was a little gamey looking for me to go swimming in. Too bad, since it was 108 and a swim would've been nice. I do have to say the bellman were very nice and very helpful. Most of the rest of the staff were also congenial. They also allowed a late check out time of 1:30 p.m. which was very nice since the convention didn't end until 12:45. Getting a cab to the airport was no problem and that was nice too. All in all, there are too many rooms in Vegas to put up with issues like these. I highly suggest management look into housekeeping staffing levels. They are not keeping up! It's too bad.

The monorail entrance is about 300 meters from the hotel. A modern, stylish gem for Vegas, without all of the casino and 'resort' entrapments for your dollars. The nearest casino/resort is the Wynn, across the street. Rooms are modern/stylish with a very comfortable desk chair (great job, interiors people!) and comfy bed. The huge 50+\" flatscreen had a good channel selection, and the modernized iBahn interactive setup was excellent and easy to use. My only beef was the in-room movie pricing: $9.99? My room had a small refrigerator as well as a lounging sofa, but this may not be a typical room. They advertise an evening turndown service, but that never happened during my stay. The bathroom was lit well, and had a separate tub and standing shower, with Aveda amenities, the standard for this brand. Not sure why other reviewers had issue here. No complaints at all: it's functional, modern, and though lacking some of the fancy, this is, again, not a \"Resort\", and not trying to be one. The internet had its slowish moments, as the hotel was fully booked the weekend I stayed, but it was wireless at least. If you are upgrading to one of the concierge floors, or have Marriott status, the lounge is on the 15th floor, with views of the north of the strip, and mountains. Foods here were nicer than typical Marriott lounges, and the staff is very attentive. The fitness center was equipped with bikes, treadmills, and ellipticals, as well as free weights, and some resistance equipment. About what I expect for this size hotel. If you need a larger / better gym, the front desk can recommend. The pool area was the only lacking part of the experience. It is in a courtyard arrangement (hotel surrounds it) meaning it gets sun only part of the day. The pool is also quite shallow, only up to 3.5 ft. Not a place to stay if you're expecting a lot of water time, that's where the nearby resorts do upstage this place. Also, the music was this awful smooth/relaxy/downtempo soundtrack that was often too loud. I had to have staff turn it down (twice) so I could hear my own. One benefit is that the pool is open evenings to cool off, while many other hotels close theirs at dusk. The whirlpool was popular, but the weather was too hot for me to sample it. Restaurant onsite is the \"Envy\" steakhouse, and quite good. The lounge's happy hour specials were quite competitive with anything on the strip, with an added bonus of being a more sedate and smoke-free environment to enjoy your relaxing cocktail. There is also a cafe for quick morning eats and coffee, if you do not have lounge access or don't wish to use the restaurant. All in all, you could do much worse in this town for the location and price. Certainly shop around, because if you want the resort experience, it can be had for the same pricing. This hotel is structured around the single business traveler or couples, not groups, and definitely not the kiddies (thank goodness!)

Having heard about the hotel from a friend, we booked our rooms based primarily on the fact that the Renaissance is a non-smoking, casino-less property. The first thing you notice when you check in is the quiet and unpolluted surroundings. Having stayed several times on the Strip, it was at first a bit unnerving! Is no one staying here? The thoughts quickly faded as I realized that there were people everywhere. They were just all relaxing and unwinding in the spacious lounges and lobby area. This is a great start, I thought! The only unfortunate event was having to wait over an hour for the first room, and nearly three hours for the second. The hotel desk staff were absolutely professional and completely accommodating because`of this, and we were satisfactorily compensated for this inconvenience. I've always believed that sparkling, attentive service can overcome any distraction, and in Renaissance's case, that was more than apparent. The rooms were very clean and comfortable, and QUIET! The mattresses were fantastic and there were plenty of soft pillows to prop yourself up to watch the 46\" flat panel TV, if that happened to be your inclination! I don't know if this is a Vegas-wide issue, but the little reefer was basically a room temperature storage box. We had a big ice chest, so although we didn't need the reefer, it was still confusing why it was there at all. The coffee maker was one of those one-cup-at-a-time machines, which we used only for making hot water. Can't understand why they would get rid of the carafe, other than maybe for sanitary reasons. Internet service was available at $13 for 24-hour access, which seems to be the industry standard. We were just a five-minute walk from the Las Vegas Monorail, which was the best way to get to and from the Strip. Although there's plenty of free parking along the Strip, the 24-hour monorail pass at $9 per person was well worth the hassle of driving. Envy Steakhouse was our breakfast meeting place with our family and extended family and the options were as varied and they were delicious. No complaints here at all! Entrees were between $10-16, with an a' la carte section. The coffee, by the way, was outstanding, as was our hostess. Another huge plus was the free parking in an enclosed garage. A bit of an up-and-down ride on two elevators to get there, but not of any significance. The only other issue we had for the entire weekend, was that we were in no real rush to leave this peaceful hotel on our Sunday checkout day, that we ended up getting stuck in the infernal traffic leaving Vegas! After making the 40-mile trip to Primm in a little over two hours, and walking around the Outlet Mall for another two, we decided to head back to Vegas and try again the next morning. Our unexpected, extra night in Vegas was spent on the Strip at the Flamingo Hotel. Not bad, but if only I'd known about the third night free at the Renaissance, I would've made a beeline back there.

Wasn't happy that the staff failed to let us know about it being there thus possibly saving us some hassle. One big plus is that it is located very conveniently to the monorail, so travel to the wild strip area was simple.

Like other reviewers, this is not the place to stay if you want the full Vegas \"experience.\" It's not marketed that way, anyway, as it's adjacent to the LVCC. What you'll get is a peaceful, clean, quite room with the Marriott class service and \"look\" of their properties for business travelers.

Tip: Provision up before you check in, or find a way to go shopping for snacks and drinks. The fridge is a big plus out here ... I haven't experienced the \"noise\" others have noted, only during day with housekeeping. Internet service, no problem either. It's an easy 10 minute walk to the North Hall, about the same walking time as the Hilton. Less the fact there's an Elvis Tribute convention there now ... again, another reason to stay here. Service is excellent, due in part to the fact it's a smaller property and thus, a higher staff/guest relation factor. You certainly cannot possibly get that at the bigger hotels around here. Even so, there's a monorail station at the convention center, giving you the convenience of going to the Strip if need be. I reserved a \"mid floor\" room and got it, including a nice view of the Wynn Golf course across the street. Green is an added amenity here, amid this concrete/asphalt jungle, so it's nice to see the greenery separating me from the strip hotels.

I really enjoyed my stay here this June 2010. The location is close to the airport (10-15 minute shuttle ride). It is not located on The Strip, so getting around is quite tricky. If you don't rent a car, there's a monorail which shuffles nearby. This monorail is a $12.00 pass for the whole day to travel back & forth. I used this monorail for the entire day, it stops a various hotels along the strip and you can exit and walk where you need to. Plus, this hotel has an award winning restaurant called \"ENVY\" (a bit on the pricy side)...but you get a good meal, plus the staff goes above and beyond. TIPS: When you arrive at the airport, BEWARE of the cab drivers!! My driver gave me two options: the long way or the cheap way!!! Of course, I wanted to more reasonable way (who doesn't !!). Since the hotel is 10-15 minutes away from the airport he took the \"freeway\" and went around and around to get to the hotel, milking every 0.50cents he could from me. I ended up paying $30.00 when I exited his cab!! This realisticly should have been a $15.00 cab ride. THE BEST THING TO DO: There are hotel shuttles which no one hears about!!! FIND THEM!! They stop at each hotel along the strip or others along the way! Once you exit the airport, they're located in the arrival area where those 'dreaded' cab drivers are nearby. CHOOSE THESE HOTEL VANS!!! It's a total of $7.00 for a drop off!!!! What a major money saving tip!!! I used a company called \"BELL TRANS\" when departing that day to go home. The hotel concierge called Bell Trans for me to pick me up that morning for my flight. They arrived promptly, and $7.00 later I was at airport for my flight! DO YOURSELF A FAVOR...DO NOT TAKE THE LOCAL CAB DRIVERS!!! THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF!!! Plus since the hotels don't have their own shuttle vans for this, they normally don't advertise them.

For starters, I'm 33 and I don't look forward to trips to Las Vegas. I've been out there a lot. I used to enjoy it, but it's gotten really old for me. I've stayed in places from the Excalibur and MGM Grand up to the Venetian and Mirage, and a lot of places in between. (And once upon a time, I even stayed at the Sahara.) To be fair, I have enjoyed many of these properties. I just don't get excited about Vegas anymore. These days, I travel to Las Vegas 2 -3 times per year for business. On rare occasions, my wife and I take a brief vacation there. On my business trips, I have stayed at a number of Strip properties, but I tried the Renaissance for my most recent two trips and likely will continue to stay here on future trips. As many other reviewers have noted, the Renaissance is not on the Strip. Therefore, if you're looking for the full Vegas experience, you won't like it here. This is a business hotel located next to the Convention Center. Set your expectations accordingly. The hotel has a reasonably good restaurant -- ENVY the steakhouse -- and a convenient cafe/newsstand just behind the lobby. There is also a lobby bar just off of the lobby before you get to ENVY. The hotel has a pool in a narrow, center courtyard-like area, but I never saw the sun shining on it -- it was always in the shadow of the sides of the hotel. No need to bring a swimsuit here. You're far more likely to sit poolside in your clothes after a long day at the Convention Center. The business services are fairly standard. There is a business center with three computer workstations and individual printers. (It is free to print your boarding passes here.) Internet access is available in the rooms, but they only have wired Internet access, and that for a price. Wi-Fi should be standard these days. It's 2010. My rooms were clean with the standard appointments. Coffee makers are included, which is always nice. I had one maintenance issue (a slow-draining shower). I mentioned it at the front desk on my way to dinner and it was fixed when I came back. If you're in Las Vegas for business at the Convention Center and if you want to treat Vegas like it's just another city, the Renaissance is a good choice. Don't stay here if you want to experience the Strip or if you want to see what Vegas is all about. And certainly don't stay here for business if you're bringing your spouse with you.

The street noise would probably be a little better in the odd number rooms towards the inside of the hotel. The other couple we were traveling with were woke up around 3 AM by people in the hall talking and laughing when returning to their room. We're all about having fun also but wish the soundproofing were better. If you're going to the convention center the location is right next door, within walking distance.

The hotel map indicated an actual Hertz Office, but after a futile search the front desk told us there wasn't one anymore and directed us to the concierge desk. Karen was on duty there and she took good care of us as well as handling directions and, later, dinner reservations. She was quite helpful and a valuable asset to the hotel.

The staff were wonderful. My only complaint was that my room was not clean upon returing at 5PM after leaving at 8AM - but one call to the front desk resolved the problem on future days. The steakhouse restaurant is excellent, and I cannot say enough good things about this place - including close access to the convention center and monorail to get to the strip. The only negative was it was hard to get around the hotel (drive in and out) going to the strip - you had to go blocks out of the way to get anywhere.

But the Las Vegas Renaissance is a subpar Marriott property and should be avoided. The good: The lobby and common areas are really beautiful (although the pool is a tiny thing in the shade). The hotel has a botique feel and feels much better than the Marriott it is. If you're visiting the Convention Center, it's very conveniently located (although in the middle of no where for all other purposes -- and nothing else is walkable -- although the monorail is next door). The bad: Service is confused, indifferent, and poor. My room itself is Marriott standard -- perfectly adequate -- but nothing special (except for the glass shower, which is nice). I stayed here three days. My garbage pails were never emptied. Fresh water (a service they provide) was not put into my fridge. On day two, they neglected to bring me towels. There was a big dirt mark in the bathroom that was there when I got there -- and wasn't cleaned until my third day (when I complained). On day three I left my room at 10am and when I returned at 8pm, it still hadn't been cleaned. It took almost 20 minutes for the house keeping supervisor (who was quite nice) to arrive in my room -- to then figure out what to do next. But the final insult: When I finally was able to get back to my room after they had cleaned it, the front desk left a message asking me to come downstairs to run my credit card again because they didn't get a proper imprint of it the first time -- from two days earlier. The rude desk clerk couldn't seem to fathom why I didn't want to run downstairs and service his needs. I essentially told them what they could go do with their imprint!! Oh -- and the internet service is painfully slow in the evening when other people are using it (for $12.95 a day). If you're attending a Convention, this might be an ok choice if you're just looking for a place to stay.

They began to recognize me after the first week I spent with them, and I now know several of them as well. I can usually get whatever I request brought to my room almost immediately, and the staff seem genuinly surprised when I tip them for service. Staying at this hotel makes it much more easy to do the work I'm brought there to do, because its quiet but energetic atmosphere allows me to relax and rest. My one complaint is the TV service. Though 32\" LCD TVs are now standard, HD service is not yet available at this hotel (or any other Marriott hotel I've used in the last year). Repeated questions/complaints to the Marriott corporation go unanswered, and it's becoming very frustrating. I'm now a Platinum Rewards member, yet I still can get no response to this. Is HDTV so unattainable that Marriott considers it hopeless even to contact me with an answer about this? From time to time I stay at a competing chain's hotel in Las Vegas, and every room I've had there offers 2 42\" HDTVs with beautiful HD signal. I pay approximately the same price at this competing chain as I do at the Renaissance, and the service is almost as good at the other chain as at the Marriott. So why does it seem to be such a problem for Marriott to upgrade their TV service? OK, one more positive about the Renaissance - the Envy steakhouse offers excellent steaks, delicious pea soup, a very nice chopped salad, and a fantastic \"crabmeat dynamite\" appetizer. Service is usually courteous, though a bit slow at times. Their room service is wonderfully appetizing, and the desserts exceptional (Mango/Ginger upside-down cake!). For a quick, informal meal, if you can get there early enough, the Ego cafe offers some nice choices, too. Bottom line - if you want a relaxing, quiet hotel with wonderful, attentive, personable staff, you will find it at the Renaissance.

I stay frequently at Marriott brand hotels and this hotel had many of the familiar positive attributes of a Marriott but also had some drawbacks. I doubt I'll return to it on my subseqent Las Vegas trips. Check In: Arrived at 9 p.m. Waited for 7 or 8 minutes to check in while the sole person at registration was speaking with another guest. The front desk representative was not overly friendly nor was he rude or unfriendly, but we didn't feel a warm or professional welcome was provided. He seemed rather uninterested in checking us in. Valet and Bell Staff: Quite exceptional. Cars brought in a very timely fashion, always professional and friendly. Luggage handled well. Room: Had a separate glass shower with a very small separate tub. The room is of moderate size and had the usual great Marriott bed and bedding/pillows. The carpet already looks worn in the room and hallways and this hotel is not that old. The coffee maker/tea/coffee etc. is all in the bathroom as there isn't a lot of other space in the room. It does have a desk and a small refrigerator and safe and a moderate size TV and one chair, which is also quite worn. Housekeeping: Very good. I'm particular about housekeeping issues and I was very pleased. Internet: Big disappointment. There was hard wired Internet, which was free in the club level rooms, where we were located but this hotel charged $1 per minute to use the computer and internet in the Club Lounge. This is the first Renaissance hotel I have stayed at which charged for Internet and computer use in the club lounge. Way over priced. Room rate: They had good specials at this hotel and our room was a good value for the money we spent: Restaurant (The Envy): Excellant. Although I don't know that I'd return to stay at the hotel I would definitely return to the restaurant. Several friends who reside in Las Vegas had recommended the restaurant. I had a birthday celebration here and the service was incredibly and the food extraordinary. Club Lounge: Only moderate at best. They charge for the alcohol, which is different than the Marriott and Renaissance hotels we frequent (which are often international locations) and the lounge looks a bit worn also. There was always only one attendant in the lounge and she was quite pleasant, but the TV was blaring and during one of our trips to the lounge there were many young children running around playing hide n' seek and making it a noisy atmosphere. Ambience: Overall, we didn't find this hotel to be plush or have great ambience. There was nothing that was horrible about the hotel but we just didn't find the service to be fantastic. The front lobby was often filled with really loud and noisy, and sometimes obnoxious sports team members, which the staff did nothing to control. I prefer the Marriott Suites, which is a couple of blocks from this hotel. Location: We chose it because we prefer to stay off the strip as I am usually here visiting family or on business and not here for the gambling. The location is fine and is next to the convention center. It is a $10 taxi ride to the main part of the strip or you can use the monorail, which has a stop right next door.

You'll get at least one flat-panel TV in your room. Beds are very comfortable, and there are lots of towels. This hotel does space-available upgrades for Elite members, which is a nice change compared to some other Marriott properties. The room I had included a walk-in shower and separate tub, with a spacious bathroom. They have Aveda products in the bathroom, so you don't have to smell like the standard Marriott Bath and Body Works shampoo/soap. Pool: Small pool that doesn't always have a lot of sun, so if you are expecting a deep tan, you might need to find a pool elsewhere. I enjoyed the pool, though. Food: Envy restaurant is outstanding. We had breakfast there this year, and it was outstanding. I ate there for dinner last year, and the steak was one of the best I have ever had. Location: You can take a tram to the strip (for a fee), or you can grab a Taxi. They also have free valet parking, so I always rent a car and park it there. I like staying off-strip, but if you want to be closer to the action, you may want to stay on the strip. Other notes: This is a non-smoking hotel (except in the pool area), which is really nice. If you want to smoke, you may want to stay elsewhere. This hotel offers a concierge lounge during the week, which is nice. It is open 24/7 for bottled water, which is also nice.

From the outside this hotel isn't all that impressive, but inside it is a different story. All of the interior spaces we visited were very modern, sleek and elegant. Our room was also very attractive, well designed and sparkling clean. The amenities were very good: in-room fridge, nice goodies in the bathroom/shower (Avena), real glassware, a bathrobe, extra pillows and blanket in the room, iron and ironing board, hair dryer. In-room internet access $12.95 which I think about standard for the better Vegas hotels (but I still resent paying that much for Internet). The TV is 32\" flat panel HDTV, but as far as I could see there was no high definition programming. The king bed was superb.. pillow top mattress (I think) with plenty of plump pillows.

The Renaissance Las Vegas is one of the few hotels in Las Vegas where gambling is NOT on premises. For some this is a preference, others not. Thus, if you are in search for a hotel with gambling on-site, the Renaissance is not for you. Location: The Renaissance is located close to the Convention Center. For proximity, the hotel is across from the Wynn Golf Course. Thus, if using The Strip for geography purposes, if you are at the Wynn/Encore, the Renaissance is approx. \u00be miles due east as the crow flies. Please note, there is no direct access to The Strip by foot. Most use cars, taxi or the Monorail (the station is approximately 100 yards away). We used the Monorail (convenient but not cheap) and our car (parking at the hotel and all over Las Vegas is free of charge). We usually parked at The Flamingo and walked from there. Hotel Check-In: We entered the hotel and my immediate reference would be Starwood\u2019s \u201cW\u201d line of hotels. A very sleek interior design yet inviting i.e. marble, wood all in a modern design. Check-in, very efficient and quick, provided a room on the 8th floor and all requests were honored i.e. kg. bed, higher floor. Please note, this is a NON-Smoking hotel. Room: The room was very nice and well designed. With a modern design, the room would be perfect for business and leisure. Upon entry is a hallway with the requisite bathroom access which uses a \u201cpocket door\u201d for access (nice design and saves room versus a swing door). The main room was quite spacious. Large comfortable bed, night tables, a armoire (instead of a closet, w/ iron and board) built-in\u2019s hiding the mini-frig (no mini-bar, just bottled water), nice work desk with a very comfortable office chair, flat-screen TV, nice sitting chair with ottoman, floor to ceiling windows and an efficient A/C unit. See Pictures. Bathroom: Spacious by most standards with a separate shower stall and full tub. Well designed vanity of granite with frame mirror. Make-up mirror small and non-lighted, yet unattached i.e. can be taken anywhere in the bathroom/room. Shower stall has nice design including a ledge to place your foot on while soaping up. Speakman shower head, water pressure is excellent. See Pictures. Fitness Area: On the 2nd level, better than average equipment including the newest in cardio-vascular equipment and a weight area. Two large TV\u2019s w/ remotes, towels, fresh fruit and juice all self-serve, open 24 hours. Pool Area: Small yet inviting, shaded by design. The pool is small, 3\u2019 in depth more for cooling down. Hot tub seats 12 in comfort. Nice outdoor furniture including lounges and loveseat set-ups. Rarely used and not a \u201cpool scene\u201d. If looking for a family pool, consider The Flamingo or Bellagio, for an \u201cadult scene\u201d consider Bare at Mirage. Most relaxing, after a long day, dip in the pool and hot tub at night, very inviting with subdued lighting. See Pictures Restaurant: The on-site restaurant, Envy is EXCELLENT. While billed as a steak house, it is so much more. The interior, like the hotel is modern in design yet most inviting. We enjoyed the $39/prix-fixe and it was an excellent 3-course meal. I have enjoyed the finest restaurants in LV, Envy can stand-up to all of them with excellent food and spectacular and efficient service. The Gnocci appetizer is to \u201cdie for\u201d. Bar: There is a nice bar adjacent to the restaurant. Nice place to meet for dinks or just to relax. Can receive service from Envy Steak House as well. Sundry Store: There is a small store/snacks in the hotel which serves Starbucks Coffee. We did not visit; however, we did see guests buying breakfast items on the run. Parking: There is valet and self-service parking adjacent to the hotel in a multi-level structure attached to the hotel.

We promptly called the front desk and it took almost an hour for the housekeepers to arrive with clean sheets. It was about 9pm on Fri 07/17/09. After the beds were made (one with my friend's sheets on it), I went to speak with the Manager at the front desk. I told him what I had found in the bed I had slept in the night before and he kept saying \"But the sheets have been changed, so everyhting is fine now, right?\" And I would say \"No, because I slept in a dirty bed that a man had slept in the previous night, the previous week, or the previous month.\" He kept repeating \"But we changed the sheets so everything is fine now, right?\" Eventually, he said that he had to \"check with the crew\" who would have taken care of the room and the morning manager. The next morning, not having heard from anyone, I went to the front desk again and the same routine of \"Everything is fine now\" took place. The morning manager on duty said that they had to \"look into it\" and that they would get back to me. That evening I went to the front desk again (third time) and had to explain the whole thing again. I guess Marriott managers don't communicate with each other? After I explained what had happened AGAIN, I got the same response \"The sheets have been changed, so everything is OK now, right?\" I'm convinced Marriott trains its Managers to play idiots. Or maybe they hire idiots. After repeating the fact that I found disgusting that the sheets where this man had done God knows what hadn't been changed so that I ended up sleeping in them the night before and that housekeeping had had two opportunities to rectify the situation (first, after the man left/before we checked in AND the next morning after we left the room and room service made the beds) the THIRD manager finally said \"What would you like to see happen?\" I said \"I think I shouldn't pay for the night when I slept in a bed that someone else had used.\" And he said \"Sure, we'll take that charge off your bill.\" My question is: Why didn't the FIRST manager offer to take the charge off the FIRST time I brought up the issue? It took me explaining the situation multiple times to three managers (suposedly the \"decision makers\" there) for them to do the right thing. And I had to practically tell them how to rectify the situation. What, it hadn't occurred to them that I shouldn't have to pay for sleeping in those sheets? UNBELIEVEABLE! After all, this was the Marriott, not Motel 8. To top it all off, I'm germ-phobe (I had wiped down the remote, light switches, door knobs when we checked in). I NEVER thought that a Marriott property would fail to provide clean sheets. Now, I'll always bring my own.", "Date": "July 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Napa, California", "Title": "\u201cVery nice stay...would return\u201d", "Author": "LQGuy", "ReviewID": "UR36086110", "Content": "We have stayed at numerous \"off strip\" hotels in Las Vegas.

The interior is very spacious and nicely decorated. The staff are extremely polite and friendly, which is a big plus in Vegas. I was offered an olive-shaped (but conventionally flavoured!) chocolate upon check-in and my room had a mini-fridge with two (I think - or hope) free bottles of water, which is restocked daily. I had a normal room with king bed. The bathroom is nice, with a bath and walk-in shower cubicle. There is a nice big LCD TV, a clock-radio and a large desk. An iron and ironing board are also provided. Huge windows give a pretty amazing view. My room faces towards the Stratosphere and the Hilton, although other rooms must face towards the other end. Ask for a high floor for the best views! I realised quite late on that the windows are not mirrored, so do not walk around naked in front of them, like I did. There's a pool, which is unmanned and enclosed by the hotel, so it does get dark quite early. This being vegas though, it was still very warm even at midnight, but it might not be ideal if you're trying to get a tan. On the whole, I can only find one fault with this hotel, and that is the wireless internet. I'm on the 12th floor, and the internet is terrible. The connection is very weak on all of my devices and frequently cuts out and suffers from extreme slowness. This is probably just affecting a small number of rooms, but it has been a problem for me. The monorail is a great boost to this hotel, since it makes getting around in vegas a lot easier (although note that to get out of the monorail stations onto the strip, you need to navigate through the casinos, so you'll still need to walk!).

The beds are very comfortable with nice sheets. The bathrooms had a bathtub and a separate glass enclosed shower. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The biggest problem I had with this hotel is that the walls between the rooms have no or very little sound insulation. To be fair, this is a problem at many Marriotts and many other hotel brands.

If you are not afraid of a little walk it would be possible to walk to the north end of the central strip. If it is really hot, cold or late at night the walk probably wouldn't be a good idea. A monorail station is a short walk across a parking lot. Compared to other cities subways it is expensive.

There are a number of toppings that can be added to customize your burger at no charge --- it's nice to have those options without adding $$$ for each. It is DEFINITELY worth it to upgrade to the truffle fries! I enjoyed this dinner as much as any other we had in Vegas! Access to Vegas in less than 5 minutes, you can be on the monorail headed up to the strip --- for the most part, when you look at where the monorail stops are compared to the hotels, the Rennaisance is as close or closer than any of the other hotels on the monorail.

This hotel was no exception. All of the staff was very friendly, especially the employees at the front desk and at Envy. The room was very clean, there was a separate shower and tub in the bathroom, and the room was very quiet. Why was it important that the room was quiet? Because over the Labor Day weekend, an Anime convention was held. What did this mean? Hundreds of teenagers running around in full costume. EVERYWHERE. In the lobby. In the lounge adjacent to the bar. Outside the hotel. I had read the reviews about the pool (there is barely any sun and smokers tend to congregate there), but I didn't have a chance to check it out! The costumed guests had taken over the entire pool area as well, eliminating any opportunity for relaxation on the lower level of the hotel. Although I didn't complain (what could the staff do?), I was very surprised that management was so disorganized that they allowed this group to completely take over the first floor. It definitely reduced my enjoyment of the hotel. That said... PROS: Very attentative staff, free Envy signature cocktail for silver members, clean room, larger than expected fitness center, restaurant.com offers discounts for Envy, great location if you have a car and want to be off the strip. CONS (Besides the Anime takeover): For the price, I felt that the food at Envy was only average. The pancakes and design-your-own omlette were good, but not spectacular. (For spectacular, try the lemon souffle pancakes at the Stanford Court Marriott in San Francisco!) Similarly, the burger and prawn appetizers for lunch were just alright. I didn't try their steak, but if you don't think you are getting value at breakfast and lunch, would you gamble on dinner too? Overall this was a nice hotel and it served its purpose for having a nice room off the strip.

There is a monorail right outside the hotel that takes you to the strip area. It's $9 for a 24 hour pass, which is less than cab fare. There is a cafe that serves Starbucks products downstairs. They pretty much have everything the real store would have. Their gym is awesome. It's always packed, but if you get there early, you should have no problem. They have an outdoor heated pool with a jacuzzi, but we didn't use it, though other people were in it. The only complaint was the internet access charge, which we didn't pay for. Seems like lower class hotels offer free internet and places like this always charge. It's $12.95 for 24 hrs.

TIP: The Envy Steakhouse is expensive, but my husband and I were able to share a meal (which the waiter was more than happy to do) and we had more than enough food at a reasonable price. TIP: If you want to go over to the Wynn hotel like we did to see how nice it is (they have an awesome nightclub called Tryst), you can walk over to the monorail station and get ona complimentary Wynn hotel shuttle that will take you there. After you are there, if you want to go to the Mall, it is right across the street. Then when you want to go back to the Ren hotel, you can get back on the Wynn shuttle and it will take you back to the monorail station that is right by the Ren hotel. TIP: Since the Ren hotel is not on the strip, if you want an inexpensive way of transportation, the monorail station is right there by the hotel and you can by a 24 hr. pass for $9 per person and it will take you all along the strip all the way down to Mandalay Bay with several station stops along the way. There is some walking involved. TIP: For breakfast, you can walk across the street to the Courtyard Marriott. For us, the shop in the Ren hotel was pretty pricey. Since it was very cold, we did not use the pool which was outside. No indoor pool. The room had a small refrigerator which was convenient.

I checked in late at night after arriving at the McLaren International Airport. You have to allow some time between the airport, baggage claim and car rental facility which is apart from the airport. I used Hertz but the first car they gave me a Malibu had some warning lights about checking both the front tires so I received a Pontiac G5 instead. My drive from the auto rental facility to the Renaissance was about 10 - 15 minutes. Check in was smooth. I received a king room. I asked for quiet room away from elevator. Even number rooms X02 \u2013 X30 face West and the Strip. Even number rooms X32 and above face North with views of the convention center and Hilton. Odd numbered rooms face South or East. My room was good size and there is a high king size bed. The bed is very comfortable. There are feather pillows on the bed and for those who prefer, foam pillows in the closet. Lighting in the room was excellent. There was also a comfortable arm chair and ottoman. The room was quiet. The room had a flat screen high-definition TV, but no high-definition programming. Besides a good variety of broadcast and cable channels, the hotel offers a large selection of pay-per-view movies. The room has a good work desk and office-style chair. Under the TV were a mini refrigerator, an electronic safe, and the ice bucket with glasses. The bathrooms have both a tub and separate shower. Lighting is great. The Leather brand bath amenities are good quality and included: mint-thyme shampoo, conditioner, lotion, bath gel, and mouthwash. On the shelf below the sink is a coffee maker and hair dryer. Another nice feature is the magnifying mirror on a stand so that it can be taken to the desk to use. The room was very clean and housekeeping was excellent during my stay. I had breakfast at Envy restaurant, the buffet is not inexpensive but it was good. The hotel has a small outdoor pool and a very large exercise room. We did not use either. The Renaissance also offers valet parking. Both self and valet parking are free. One thing I like best about this property is it is close to Las Vegas Monorail and the Monorail is better than driving around Las Vegas. One morning, I took the Monorail to the Hilton for breakfast. I paid an internet special group rate of $110.00. I paid close to $200 at the Residence Inn, Hughes Center and other than the Residence Inn room has small kitchen, I preferred my stay at the Renaissance. Staff at the Renaissance were more welcoming and friendly. Several of my workshop attendees and I took the Papillion Helicopter tour from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon. I highly recommend it.

You almost can't wait to go to sleep the beds and pillows are so comfortable. Everyone I've talked to about this hotel agree that the beds are sublime. Rooms are great and very trendy and hip. I do have to say that Envy Steakhouse, while good, is a bit overpriced for what you're getting. Portions are small, and wait times are long sometimes even when you're seated. I did say it was one of the best in Vegas, but I've since been in better. It's very good, but not the best. The problem is it's a cab ride to the strip to find something better. The distance to the monorail is perfect, and you can catch the Wynn shuttle right down the street. If you do have a convention, you simply cannot beat the distance to and from the hotel and convention center unless you sleep in the convention center itself! Great fitness center too if that's important to you. The front desk service has improved 100% from years past.

I got a fantastic deal through the hotel's website at $139 for Friday and Saturday night, which is incredible for a Friday and Saturday night in October.... but more on the price later. First off the bell and valet staff. They were absolutely fantastic. I can't say enough good things about them. they were very helpfull always seemed happy to see you, and were very friendly and always willing to give directions. They were definitely top notch. Hotel, not including rooms -- This was a bit lacking. The resturaung was o.k., but a tad expensive for the quality. The lobby was nice, but the pool rediculously small. (it was rather cold so there was not a crowd, but I think it would be very crowded in the summer). The business center never seemed to be quite right. The people in the center were more interested in chatting amongst themselves than they were at getting you logged onto the internet. Also, the $10 minimum internet charge was pretty steep I thought, considering the connection speed seemed to be only a little faster than dial up. Also they only had 2 working terminals so it was very hard to even get a spot. The Starbucks right beside the business center was top notch though, and the workers there were very friendly. Rooms -- They felt old. caCarpet was not nice and gave me flashbacks to the 70's, which I am probably too young to remember. Beds were moderately comfortable, but nothing to write home about. Overall the rooms just felt out dated. Location -- The location of the hotel was actually not too bad. You were a very short walk to the tram station, maybe 100 yards away. It made getting around very handy. I don't know how comfortable I would be walking from the tram station late at night though. The surrounding neighborhood is very seedy. Also, with a rental car it is a tad diffidult going south out of the hotel. You have to drive through some pretty rough neighborhoods to do so, which made the lotion a bit unfavorable. Front Desk -- Most were very helpfull, but I did talk to one that was just downright rude. They were trying to charge me $239, instead of $139, and he was kind of \"well that's just the way it is\".. nothing I can do about it. Luckily the manager was a little more caring however and was able to get me my original $139 rate. Overall -- I would stay here any time for $139 on Friday or Saturday. At $239, which is more usually the price, I would probably stay at the Signature MGM for just a few more dollars. Much nicer and way better location if you were looking to not stay at a mega resort. With the roughness of the surrounding neighborhood, there are far better places for the $239 rate.

Check-in was very fast, taking about two minutes. We received a king room with a strip view as requested on the 14th floor.

Pay per view movies 8.99, less expensive than many other hotels that I have stayed at lately. The room has a good work desk and office-style chair. High-speed internet was complimentary, but this may have been because we were staying on a Club Floor. The internet connection was the fastest I have ever measured at a hotel.

A very complete breakfast for my wife and I with tax and tip came to about $35.00. In the evenings Envy is a steakhouse. We did not have a free evening to try it, but it looks like they take steaks and wine very seriously. The Club Lounge on the 15th floor was not open over the weekend, but we were able to use it for breakfast Monday morning.

The location is off strip, non smoking, non casino. Which can be good and bad. Depending on what you are looking for. Had a room on the 11th floor with view of whole Strip. Very nice. The room is big and clean. Comfy bed and sheets. The bathroom is big with a seperate shower/seperate tub. The shower pressure is very powerful. No way to change the pressure. It's all one setting. I thought this was a little strange as Vegas is in the desert and not alot of water is readily available. Coffeemaker with Starbucks is available. Alot of space to put your clothes. There is a flat screen tv in the room. As other reviewers have said, the reception is bad but still viewable and it takes about 3 seconds for stations to change. Which can be a problem for some people. I thought that it was a little inconvenient when I was watching tv. No turndown service. I wonder if this is the norm or the housekeepers just forgot? It wasn't a problem for me. If you are looking for a pool scene then this isn't your hotel. Small with very few lounge chairs. The pool is covered with shade early afternoon. There is a restaurant located in the hotel. I can't comment on it because I didn't eat there. Free valet/self parking. Valet service was prompt. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for an off strip hotel. However the monorail is so close and the strip is not too far by car. It was a very convienent location for me.

After being told horror stories by the cabbie from the airport about the neighborhood around the hotel I was a bit nervous. While I'm sure he has a point, I don' t know that I would go wandering in any neighborhood area that I was not familiar with in any town, let along Vegas. Stick to using the monorail and you will be fine. It's just across the parking lot and on the grounds of the Las Vegas Convention Center. Check in was outstanding and the staff is very friendly. They hooked me up with early check in after coming in first thing from Los Angeles. The room was clean and very well decorated. The pool area was great and enjoyable. The room service was quick and very tasty. The only minor problem I had was a bad seal on the shower stall door which left quite a puddle on the floor.

I booked the night before, and got a room for $105, parking was easy (and not a marathon trek away from reception/rooms) The hotel prides itself on being a non-gaming hotel, and I appreciated the lack of slot machines and crowds of slug-like zombies traipsing through the gaming floor (anyone who has been to Vegas will know what I am talking about!). It is easy to get 'casino fatigue' in this town. The reception staff were pleasant and efficient, and quickly had me checked in and on my way up to my room. The room was a little smaller than what I am used to in Vegas, but spotlessly clean and modern. The view across to the Wynn hotel and the rest of the Strip from my room is fantastic. The hotel has a great looking steak restaurant, 'Envy' and a nice bar, and a coffee shop. I used room service, and was delighted with the level of service I received when I made my order. The food was excellent, and hot, which is unusual for room service! There is a small pool area, again very smart and clean. The entire hotel is non-smoking, as a smoker, even I appreciated that! It is just a two minute walk over to the monorail station that offers a quick run into the big hotels of the Strip.

The Ren must continue to provide compelling reasons to stay off-strip and use the monorail, and losing free internet takes away their most compelling reason.

I especially like the separate glass-enclosed shower. We were attending a meeting at the hotel and the meeting rooms were very nice. They were well-maintained by the staff, who refreshed our drinks and cleared the meeting tables at every break. The catered lunch was very good. The staff was professional and efficient. We had difficulty finding a cab on Friday evening, but the doorman made every attempt to locate one for us.

NOT FAR from the strip.\u201d", "Author": "Doraemon79", "ReviewID": "UR6778217", "Content": "I arrived Las Vegas Renaissance hotel around 4pm on wednesday. I was aware that the hotel is almost sold out because there're couple conventions going on this week & weekend (thats what I am here for too). I booked this hotel approx 1.5 month ahead with priceline so I had a very good deal. The front desk guy is very friendly and helpful. As seem from the previous review, upon the checkin, they walked around the counter and offered u their signature chocolate and personally welcome you to the hotel. Now that's a nice touch. I called ahead of the time to reserve a room on a high floor w/ view, they did that. The only time that they mentioned about priceline is that he reminded me that my stay will not be honored for their rewards program (I am silver elite level btw). The hotel is fairly new (built in 2004 I believe) so everything is in a nice condition. The beds are nice (pillowtop mattress), towels are fluffy (and there are plenty in the room), and the AC is quiet, Flat screen LCD TV in every room (26\" Phillips) and a wireless phone. The best of all, they provided WiFi for their customers inside the hotel (where other hotel would normally charges you 10-15+ dollars). I am not the type of person who cares about carpet stains but while i am looking at it..It does not shows any spots. Deco in the room is contemp. style and the furnitures are in a good condition. The blind does prevent sunshine and the AC is good (not very loud) but I have a feeling that it may not be cold enough for the summer time (Right now is around 65F in vegas - perfect weather in feb). Ample lighting and sheets are crisp and there are plenty pillows (like 6 on my bed, 2 in the closet). Workdesk is large and the chair is ergonomically designed (I would like to take this chair home actually. J/k). The refrigerater is underneath the desk and it seems like they put stuffs in it so I did not touch it. The coffee maker is provided in the room as well (under the sink, so you have to pull it out to use it), also a nice touch since some 4* hotels on the strip don't even offer you with this types of amenitis. The bathroom contains a sink, toilet (strong flush, i like that). a shower (marbled) and a bathtub. It is very clean and in a good condition as well. I also get to use the club lounge on the 15th floor. It provided you with complimentary drinks & snacks & newspapers throughout the day. For those who does not have access to the lounge, there's fitness center on site that provides with free water & fresh fruits as well. I also get to use the swimming pool and jacuzzi at night (around 11pm). It is very quite and clean. However, the only thing that i didn't like about the jacuzzi is that the chemical oder is actually too strong. I am the type of person who doesn't mind using the jacuzzi at 24 hour fitness / Bally's (VERY, VERY dirty). This jacuzzi is clean but the chemical odor keeps me coughing like crazy so I had to take off early. However, there are big sofa-style couch next to the poolside (plenty~ at least 5+) where people can relax. I used the pool at night so I can not tell whether this is good enough for sunbathing (I am not into tanning either). Parking garage is convient too, its right next to the hotel and its not too far from the hotel elevators (unlike big scale hotels where u actually walked 5-10mins to reach ur room), another good thing about this hotel. There are 2 restaurants (one is the steak house Envy) and another deli shop like store located on the 1st floor. I didn't get to try neither so I can not comment on it. Overall, this is a very good hotel located close to the strip (right next to the monorail station too). You can take the shuttle to the Wynns hotel (8am-8pm) or else it will be a good idea to rent a car if u want to get around this town. There is also a McDonalds like 2 tiny blocks down so budget minded travellers can eat (or take their kids to eat). The quality of the room, the staff, and the price is already make me feel that I choose the right hotel. I stayed at the Paris (Calais suite on 34th Floor, facing bellagios), bellagios, MGM, Mandalay Bays, Venetian, Monte Carlos...etc. Most of them did not offer the service which a 4* hotel should have (the quality of the room amendities and the customer service). This hotel sets a standard where a 4* hotel should be. A hotel's star rating should be based on their room and service, not how BIG they are or how much they spent to mimic effiel tower, etc. ***** One big note. After I returned I returned my car to the airport and about to check in at the airport, I realized that my house key is missing! I immediately called the hotel and asked them to search for me (its around 630pm) and the security guy (Gary) took my number and told me that if the room is not occupied he will search for me personally. He returned my call after 10-15 mins and let me know that he went thru my room (I know that he did it b/c he pointed out whats left in my room) and I really, really appreciated his time to search for it. I think this hotel's service is great. One minor thing I think that they need to improve on top of the jacuzzi odor is the conceriage. They should be more informative and should able to provide some local tourist coupon since afterall, vegas is still a big, big tourist city. Most people go there for leisure. Will definitely come back to this hotel again!

Pros: Attractive upscale hotel of manageable size, quiet, clean air, nicely furnished rooms, free parking, free Internet. Cons: Away from The Strip, surly staff. I have stayed here several times, most recently in December 2006. Everyone who goes to Vegas enough has a favorite hotel there. I personally like to have a quiet hotel to retreat to after living it up amidst the wonderful noise and chaos that is Las Vegas. The Renaissance provides this beautifully. There is no casino in the hotel, it is a non-smoking hotel, and it's not too large a place so there's no problem in navigating it. It is located next to the Convention Center, where there is a tram you can take to The Strip if you don't want to taxi or drive. Self-parking and valet are free. I like the modern decor in the lobby and guest rooms. It's not lavish, just very nicely done, pleasing to the eye. A lobby bar, a lobby restaurant that people come from miles away to eat at, and flat screen TVs in every room. The pool area is small and boxed in on all sides and only has sun for a few hours mid-day, so plan carefully if you want to take advantage of that. Also, the pool area is one place where folks can smoke, so it was sometimes smokey out there. There are some really cool lounge chairs, er, couches really. The exercise room is available 24 hours and is well-stocked with treadmills, weight machines, bicycles, and even a few gizmos that I'm not sure what they do. There is free WiFi in the lobby. In the room you connect through a cable, but it's still free. I found the servers in the restuarant to be wonderful and friendly, as were all of the valets. But the front desk staff, concierge, and the wait staff in the bar either avoided serving us or were actually hostile on multiple occasions in a stay of less than one week in duration. You have to wonder if there isn't a management problem at a place when this many people have a negative attitude toward their customers. My friends and I were pretty shocked.

I was travelling with my family to Las Vegas, and was also in charge of making all of the travel arrangements. Having never been to Las Vegas, I was nervous about booking a bad hotel. I had originally booked a hotel in an isolated section of the Strip, but went with the Renaissance instead when Travelzoo advertised a $89/weeknight or $99/weekend night rate. I decided to go with the Renaissance because based on what I could find on the web, my original hotel was not in the most convenient section of the Strip, and the Renaissance, though off the Strip, was a better quality hotel. I am happy to say that I was not disappointed. The staff at the Renaissance was excellent, especially the concierge and everyone at the bell desk. The hotel was spotless, and parking was free! (By the way, valet and self parking is free at virtually all of the casinos on the Strip, so you are probably better off driving than taking a cab.) In addition, the beds were extremely comfortable (my mother was still talking about them a week after we returned) and the hotel was smoke-free, which I appreciated after my third night in Vegas. I also liked that I did not have to walk through a casino to get to my hotel room. The only unfortunate aspect of the Renaissance is the location. You do feel isolated from the excitement on the Strip, and driving from the hotel to the Strip could get draining after some time. However, the commute is manageable if you have a rental car. My family loved the hotel, and even my relatives who were staying at one of \"the big casino hotels\" on the Strip (for $240/weekend night in a room that was not as nice as ours) were impressed.

We've stayed here several times, most recently in October. The Marriott web site had a stay 3, pay for 2 night deal for $149 a night over the weekend. The hotel is only a couple of years old and overall very nice, but as others have noted, the insulation is poor and you will hear the noise from the room next door. The beds are comfortable, there is free internet access in the room, and service from the front desk and housekeeping was fine. We had breakfast in the concierge lounge (as a Marriott Gold member) and one morning there was one person letting in members (over 20 by my count) of his party who obviously were not authorized to use the club - they waited at the door and he kept going over to see if anyone was there and opening it. No one on the staff noticed this or if they did, they ignored it. As a result there was a large, noisy party in the club occupying most of the space and making it hard for others to get the benefits they deserved - we observed several people leave due to a lack of seating. One point worth noting: the design of the pool is very poor. It is a small area and in a courtyard between the buildings. This results in half the pool area being in the shade in the morning, and the entire pool being in the shade in the afternoon so if having a nice pool area is a consideration you need to take this into account. (The Mirage has one of the best pools in Vegas). The first night we dined in Envy, their steakhouse. The food was very good and cheaper than at other Vegas steakhouses, but the service was poor.

Also checked out incredible shows: Zumanity & O. I highly recommended them & would definitely see O again (even at $150 a pop). [----] As for food, I recommend the Eiffel Tower Restaurant at the Paris Las Vegas Hotel for an evening of fine dining. It's just above the Strip on the 11th floor in an Eiffel Tower replica. It offers French cuisine, breathtaking views of the Las Vegas strip including the Bellagio's famous watershow. [----] For brunch I recommend Top of the World restaurant at the Stratosphere. Located 109 stories above the strip, it offers unparalleled views as the restaurant revolves 360 degrees. I had the crab benedict & french toast -- the best I have had.

This is unheard of for a 4-star hotel near the strip. Closest decent 4-star was NYNY at $169 a night. I saved a bundle, took that money, bet black on the roulette table and won $200. To the discriminating traveler, the staff made the stay extra pleasant by providing great service to us. The bag guy was very friendly, the valet was prompt and courteous, the checkin/out was quick and easy (even give you candies when you check-in), the conceriege was very knowledgable and knew exactly what I was talking about, the housekeeping was top notch - and even left us extra soap and towels. Our room didnt have much of a view but we could see the monorail, convention center, wynn, hilton, and part of the back of the strip. If you are at attending a convention at the Las Veags Convention Center - I HIGHLY recommend staying here as it is like 100 yards from the entrance. Its not on the strip, so that is one of my compliants. Lots of 'older' people at the hotel - which is nice if you like it quiet and boring. So we had a nice quiet nights sleep after a long night of partying. Pool scene = bad, old wrinklies sunbathing, couples, and hairy guys. The restaurant: Envy has excellent food at great prices during lunch. top notch service there with a full bar. Cafe wasn't too impressive though. This is not your typical casino/hotel on vegas, if you're younger this is a good place to stay as it doesn't hurt your budget and you get a great place to stay. If you are older and don't like the smoke of casinos, loud noises, and distractions from the strip this is also excellent as it is a 4-star hotel thats clean and relaxing. The rooms were typical, no where near spacious. LCD 32\" swivel tv, but no HD. Accomodating with the beds. Can't get 2 queens though. Safe and refrigerator come in handy. Bathroom was clean and tiled with a stone looking finish. Walk in shower with glass surround and clean tile. Bath tub also included by itself. Granite counter tops. Not much leg room to stretch. Has a nice computer chair and internet - I think you can plug your computer into the 32\" LCD TV for easy viewing, movies, etc. A lot of modern features that a new hotel should have. View was as good as it gets, which is no where near spectacular like the larger strip hotels. Overall a FANTASTIC BUY so much in fact we stayed an extra day for over $100 less than the next cheapest 4-star hotel.

Its not cheap at $5.00 a ride. Its better value to buy a 10 ride pass for $35.00. The thing I liked most about the Renaissance was that it does not have a casino, therefore you do not have a passing parade of tourists crowding the place nor does the foyer smell of cigarette smoke like most hotels in Vegas. The decor is very understated and chic. Rooms are retro/modern in style and the beds are very comfortable. Excellent airconditioning. We ate at the hotel restaurant, very funky decor and nice food, not outrageously priced either. The pool is in a central courtyard, its not large, nor does it get direct sunlight all day, so you needed to time your visit to coincide with the sun, which was late morning to early afternoon.

No choice at breakfast - you had to have the buffet which is fine if you eat a lot at breakfast time - but we don't. Ended up going to other local hotels or the strip to find better value meals.

Nice view but the Western exposure kept the room very hot in the afternoons as the sun was setting - we usually kept the blinds closed tight from Noon until after sunset. We couldn't get the A/C in our room to go below 72 degrees. We heard no noise from the Monorail. Concierge staff tried to be helpful but were clueless as to the status of the various shows in town. Every room has free wired Internet access. The hotel states that local phone calls are a dollar a piece, but they will all be free upon checkout. Seven nights of our stay were booked with the \"Stay for Breakfast\" package. The room was $159.00 a night and included full breakfast for two in the Envy restaurant (two coupons good for up to $17.50 a piece, not including tip). The first three mornings they had a very nice buffet breakfast - this was very important to me as it allowed me to eat fairly quickly before walking over the Convention Center.

We each had a room and took advantage of an \"Escape Your Way\" package that we saw on the Marriott web site. Basically, we were to get a room for $149/night, and by staying more than three nights, one of the nights were to be credited when we checked out. My friend had stayed at the Renaissance during April 2005 and was impressed. However, this most recent stay has changed our opinion of this property. When we checked in, we were met by Margie. My friend had been a platinum Marriott Rewards member up until this year, and during his stay last year, he received a complimentary entrance into a 15th floor lounge due to his platinum status. When we checked in, he asked Margie about the possibility of getting access to the lounge due to his past status. Margie was extremely rude in telling him that, no, he could not get access due to the capacity at the hotel. It would have been OK if she'd have been nice about it, but here rude demeanor certainly was unnecessary. We both got rooms on the 9th floor. When my friend went to check in to his room, he found that the room was already occupied. My room was OK. A return to the front desk quickly resolved the issue, but nevertheless, this is a critical error on the part of the hotel, not just for my friend, but for the occupants of the room he was originally given. The room amenities are very nice, and I must say, the cleaning staff was friendly. There's a refrigerator in the room with two bottled waters upon check in. On Monday morning, I asked a cleaning staff member for an additional water, and was given four. That's the type of customer service I'm accustomed to when I stay at a Marriott property. The breakfast \"buffet\" consisted of eggs made-to-order and four-to-five other hot items. Cereal and fruit were also included. However, at $16.95, the breakfast is extremely overpriced. Do yourself a favor: Take the monorail one stop down to the LV Hiton and go to their coffee shop. When I checked out, I received an invoice which did not properly credit a night of my stay as per the \"Escape Your Way\" package agreement. After waiting for printer problems to be resolved, I finally got a copy of the invoice with a night credit. However, upon checking my AmEx today, I was billed the total amount without the \"Escape Your Way\" credit. Now I'm going through the process of getting that rectified.

In my opinion, the value this hotel offers is really excellent, especially if you can get it on Priceline (hint to bidding: this is the only 4 star hotel in the UNLV/Convention Center area as of 4/06, and there are several other areas like Nellis AFB that don't have 4 star hotels if you need to rebid- read up more on biddingfortravel.com). I've had luck getting it for $125-160 per weekend night when the rack rate on Marriott.com for the same time period is over $200 or $300 a night, and other 4 star hotels like Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Monte Carlo and the Mirage will run you $300-$400, and the Bellagio, Wynn and Venetian are at absolutely exorbitant rates. That's a LOT of money you can put towards cab or Monorail fare, or a car rental. (What I usually do is buy some room service or drinks there, so I pay the Priceline rate, but get credit for the stay and a few points on my Marriott Rewards.). The hotel can sometimes be busy during conventions at the Convention Center, but this means there are some real steals on dead weekends. The positives are that the rooms are well appointed, as you can see in the pictures. I would say the room size is comparable to the Mirage or TI- not as big as the upper-tier Strip hotels like theHotel, Bellagio, Venetian or Wynn, but not cramped either, like, say, the Westin Casuarina (the other name business hotel in this locale). The bed is incredibly comfortable, with a nice duvet and pillows. Separate shower and bathtub are in the bathrooms, and while the bathtub's not a soaker like you'll get at upscale Strip hotels, I'm more of a shower person myself and the shower has good water pressure. One thing to note is you get free high-speed Internet access here, unlike most Strip hotels, where it's $10 a day, another way to save some money. Room service is prompt and the food's reasonably tasty...that is, if you don't decide to cross the street and hop the shuttle bus to Wynn and eat there. The checkins have always been prompt for me (and I've suffered in lines at other Vegas casinos. even the swank ones), and the staff and concierge have always been helpful. The upper floor lounge and health facilities are nice as well, and free bottled water is a very nice touch (something else you'd have to pay for at a lot of Strip hotels). The (small) downsides I can think of are: - the walls are indeed thin- your neighbors will hear you if you are rowdy or even fairly quiet. - there's a fair distance to the parking garage from the hotel elevators, though there is valet parking here. - getting southbound on Paradise (going to Center/South Strip properties or McCarran Airport) via car is a bit tricky; your best bet is to turn left out of the parking garage and drive down Swenson (drive away from Paradise/the street with the monorail to the next intersection and turn right to go south). If you're not careful you could end up like me and driving a couple miles over I-15 if you turn on Desert Inn Road trying to get southbound on Paradise, since Desert Inn Road and Paradise are both divided roads that won't let you do lefthand turns for long stretches. - the pool is small- if wave pools, slides and waterfalls are a big part of your Vegas experience, you'll be disappointed. It's not really anything more than a Motel 6 would have, but if just getting in some swimming/hot tubbing is fine for you, then you'll be happy. All in all, I think the Renaissance Las Vegas is a GREAT value for your money, if you don't mind a bit of a walk/shuttle/taxi/Monorail ride/drive to a casino to gamble/take in a show/club/do whatever and can live without a sumptuous pool.

HIGH MARKS: service is great, trendy contemporary decor throughout, toiletries are top notch, bed is top notch, very convenient free parking in structure, free bottled water daily. NEUTRAL: room size acceptable, tv is nice but can be testy CONS: very thin walls and poor soundproofing, pool area is small and in shade most of the time since it is located in the middle of the building. I would highly recommend this property to the business traveler who would rather stay away from strip and be next to the convention center, but yet only a monorail ride if they choose to venture into the action. Also recommended for vacationers that have the same idea. Not recommended for families, as I think a hotel casino with a bigger pool would be better suited for them. I guess my only big gripe is the terrible soundproofing in the walls. It's true what some of the other reviewers have posted in that you can hear any conversation of your neighbors. I guess your experience with your stay will depend on how your neighbor's voice travels. My neighbor on one side was quiet the whole time, but the other side I could clearly hear the guys conversation everytime he spoke. I know most hotels you can hear your neighbor's voice, but that is usually when they talk loud or yell. In this case, he clearly was talking in his normal tone.

Thanks to reading the tripadvisor reviews we got the Tres Cool package - 3rd night free, concierge level, gift certificate to Envy for $119 a night. I'm really glad we got such a great rate because this hotel is not worth more than $119 a night! We were traveling with our 2 toddlers as we always do, we were treated horribly by other guests because we had our children with us. Go to the JW Marriott in Summerlin or the Venetian for that matter they're both great hotels for families. The room: Very modern furnishings and decor, I liked the look of the room. Size wise it's on of the smallest i've ever stayed in. Cool little flat screen t.v., nice bathroom too. Carpets we're spilled on and stained. We did have a nice view of the Wynn from the 7th floor. Walls are truly paper thin - you will hear everthing going on in the rooms next to you. Our neighbors we're banging on our wall at 10am because we had the tv on! It wasn't even on loud!!! We walked out later in the day just behind the couple staying next to us and the \"man\" proceded to say at the top of his voice \"people with children should not be allowed to stay at this hotel\" - to those of you that feel it is your responsibility to dictate where those of us that enjoy traveling with our well behaved children should and should not stay I have a few choice words for you, and i'd like to tell you exactly where you can go - it's really,really hot there so dress light! Food: We never did get the gift certificat for Envy, after we checked in the front desk called and said they had a package for us - we assumed this was probably the gift certificate. My husband went down to the front desk and was told they couldn't find the package. We did room service several times - worst room service menu ever!!!! No selection just a few entress for each meal time. No children's menu, we ended up spliting adult meals between the kids. Asked for hot chocolate and chocolate milk in the morning - had to wait 20 minutes for room service staff to find out if they could make chocolate milk and hot chocolate! Asked what \"souffle style\" pancakes that were listed on the room service were like - told that they were just regular old pancakes. Huh? The nicest guy on earth did deliver our meals each morning - he was really nice to the kids! Pool: I've honestly seen bigger backyard pools! Don't stay here if you enjoy time at the pool, the seats must go quickly! Concierge lounge: Tried this one morning - little breakfast burritos, pastries, whole fruit, small boxed cereals. Not much selection, but adequate. Evening appetizers consisted of meatballs and some phyllo dough thing, and a bowl of nuts, did not look appetizing. They did have a few bottles of wine out, and a small fridge with 7up, coke, and bottled water. Valet: Always took a long time to get the car, but the guys out there were very nice. We only stayed here because it was close to my husband's client. We would honestly never stay here again. Unless you get a great deal go and stay anywhere else on the strip. This place is behind the strip in a not so nice area, even the valets agree - one evening while waiting for our car a guy came running around the corner, the valet said \"Hey man are you ok, do you need help?\", the guy said no he was just running to catch a cab. The valet said \"in this neighborhood if somebody's running it's because they're being chased!\" LOVELY!!!!", "Date": "November 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, OR", "Title": "\u201cMissing the mark\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4117300", "Content": "Billed as a High End hotel with \"an imaginative service culture\" I found the Renaissance lacking in both service and culture.

A discriminating price dictates an elevated level of effort to please the guests, and the common service offered at the Renaissance can be found at several other venues in Las Vegas for much, much less.

I have travelled quite a bit and have stayed in plenty of Marriotts. This hotel is a nice business hotel. It offers basic amenities but it falls short in essential ones. First, the bad... As many have commented, the pool is small and not very funtional. The staff is serious and somewhat aloof. The corcierge level staff, one of the worst I have experienced. The first evening there, we showed up at 5:45pm (they open at 5:30pm) and the complementary snacks were already gone. When asked, the lady there said they would bring more later. The bar had items missing and we were told that the restaurant had priority and needed the booze. The room was right below the concierge and this the noise woke us up at opening time, with chairs sliding back and forth above us. The bed was hard. They have only one restaurant and no store for incidentals. The starbucks lady was miserable all 3 days we were there--does not know how to smile. Now, the good... The monorail is about a 5 min walk. There is a shuttle across the street that takes you to the Wynn (a must see). The architecture is modern and pleasant. The food in the restaurant is superb. The room itself was very nice and i appreciated having free internet access. The hotel is quiet and there are no smoky areas or busy gambling action to pass through as you look for the elevator. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel if you go there for pleasure.

We were welcomed by a warm, friendly, and cheerful staff. Free glasses of lemonade in sugar-rimmed glasses were refreshing after our travels in the heat of Las Vegas. Our request for a room with a view of the strip was honored. The view also included the lushness of the Wynn golf course. Our room was spotlessly clean. Do you think I could get them to clean my shower doors so perfectly? The decor is modern and refreshing. Beware of the bed! It's so comfortable, you may sleep longer than you mean to, like we did. Our room included two free bottles of water in the small refrigerator, a bathrobe in the armoire, Starbucks coffee, tea, and a flatscreen TV. The bathroom was beautiful as well, with a separate bathtub and shower. We loved the simple elegance of the shower so much, we're returning the insert we bought for our remodel, then copying it's design instead. We loved the great bargain we got for this quiet, smoke-free gem! After reading the reviews here, we decided to travel via the monorail for our stay. Although we enjoyed it very much, next time we'll rent a car as well. The rail travels along the back side of the strip. Take your comfortable shoes as you will still need to do much walking. Those Las Vegas blocks are at least ten times larger than the ones in our town! The monorail line goes from the MGM to the Sahara, in a quick 15 minutes. After purchasing day passes twice, paying for the shuttle bus and tips to and from the airport, and a taxi ride after a long hike to the Rio buffet, it would have been cheaper to rent a car for the weekend. We would have enjoyed visiting other parts of town as well. Traveling on the monorail is your best bet when the traffic is heavy. $10 unlimited 24 hour pass, or $3 per ride. Yes, the pool is small, but lovely. We loved strolling around it in the evening, enjoying the way the palm trees are lit up, and soaking in some peace and quiet.", "Date": "September 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cBlissfully Quiet\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3892626", "Content": "Finally, a hotel for business travelers in vegas.

I arrived on Labor Day and stayed three nights. I had a package called Tres Cool which was three nights for the price of two.

All free. The package also included $25 off any meal at Envy. The monorail is a five minute walk (pickup at the convention center) for those who want to go down strip. My total bill was just over $300 for four days and three nights. The only downside to this is the restaurant. I'd have to give it a 3 1/2.

This place is a great find. Without exception, every staff person was professional, friendly and helpful. The hotel is very clean, the beds have great linens and are very comfortable. Our only glitch was the room refrigerator wasn't working but it was replaced with a new one in less than 10 minutes. The Club Room is available 24 hours and was a great place to refresh and retreat from the heat. We took the suggestion of checking the Marriott website and used \"pkg\" in the promotion code. We got the Tres Cool Package, stay three nights and the third is free, $25 dinner credit at the hotel restaurant, ENVY and 2 monorail passses. Having breakfast available in the Club Room also saved us some expenses. All in all, it was a great value. We hesitated to use our dinner credit since most hotel restaurants leave a lot to be desired. ENVY was definitely the exception to the rule. Our meals were fabulous, much better than the one we had at Rosemary's the #1 rated restaurant on this site. The Sea Bass was the best I've ever had and my husband's creamed corn in brandy as a side dish was incredible! Although we were off the strip the monorail station is just a short walk across a parking lot. Also, just across the street you can catch the Wynn Shuttle which takes you to the Wynn and you're right on the strip at that point. No casino was also a plus...no long walk to the elevator.

And I'm glad to say that for the most part they were spot on. We arrived Sunday, July 31, 2005 and checked out Tuesday, August 2, 2005 to go stay for one night at the Venezia Tower at the Venetian. we paid $143 a night with a AAA discount and a 'voucher' explained below. I wish I knew where people were getting the $99 deals for. I have to say that after our stay at the Renaissance, the Venezia paled in comparison. POSITIVES 1. Extremely friendly staff - Everyone from the valet guy to the check-in to the concierge were all super friendly. Tipping is NOT required although we generously did. No pressure there but these people are genuine sweethearts. 2. Quiet - You walk in and it feels like a retreat. Subtle, modern decor and just a general feeling of calm. 3. Check In - Absolutely seamless. Only one issue there. We had obtained a Marriott Rewards voucher for 100 Uk Pounds which we wanted applied to our stay. Apparently these things are 'given' on ebay and so we took advantage of it. The initial clerk only credited us $110 which we found out at check out, but once we called down to reception this was corrected and we ended up with a $160 credit towards our 2 night stay. I would definitely recommend looking for these vouchers on ebay as it saved us a bundle. 4. Location - Yeah it's not on the strip but like everyone says the monorail is literally across the strip and we checked it out. Very fast and easy to use and after exiting at Harrahs and dealing with all the noise and smoke there we were extra happy to go back to the Renaissance. 5. Room - Not the largest but very clean with the exception of a minor bathroom incident which my hardy husband took care of. Overall definitely top notch. The rooms are a delight and you'll be hard pressed to actually get on the strip. NEGATIVES 1. None - Honestly, I went with high expectations and they were met. Ok the only thing I can think of is their room service.

Little Starbucks-like cafe- excellent coffee and pastries, very pleasant and sweet staff. Bar/lounge looked cool, but did not sample. 3. Bed was incredibly comfortable. Room service prompt; rooms immaculately clean and well-maintained. 4. My views may be slightly prejudiced by the great weekend rate- $106/nite for govt/military rate, which is only sometimes available. 5. Only slight problem- as stated, the pool is tiny and almost always shaded. This is somewhat mitigated by the huge, comfortable lounging beds that are in the area, and the peace and quiet there. 6. FREE WATER....FREE WATER....FREE WATER!!! Is there anything better? Seriously, it is a nice touch, especially after getting the \"thoughtful\" offer of a $4 or more bottle in my room in other Mega-resorts.

There were no conventions in town while we were there. The staff, especially the bellman and valets were helpful and friendly.

The beds were a bit firm but the bedding was luxurious and comfortable. The bathroom was large with separate shower and tub, but the shower water pressure was very weak. We used the pool and hot tub twice in the late afternoon to relax and unwind, but it is very small (the smallest I've ever seen), there is no beverage or food service, and the pool area is dark and somewhat claustrophobic.
