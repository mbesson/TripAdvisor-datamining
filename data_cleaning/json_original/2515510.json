We chose this hotel several years ago based soley on price and location (family lives about 10 minutes away). But now we come to really enjoy ourselves in what is a friendly, traditional hotel with all the amenities that we've come to appreciate in a fairly priced hotel. We bring a cooler and use the fridge for hot days, and the microwave for popcorn and morning oatmeal. Even though they have a restaurant on premesis (which we do go to), we also have the option to sleep in and still have a bite to eat. In our latest visit, Rachel at the front desk was incredibly friendly and even suggested a room facing the pool - nice touch! The flat panel TV was a Samsung - seriously, top of the line! Hello, Ramada! This is how you say you love me! The room is clean, and was well maintained. The bathroom was clean and great. The charm of this being an older property is complimented with what must be a dedicated staff of people who really take pride in their job. Rather than the one coffee, there were several. It may sound lame, but it is those little details that really capture my attention, and it's so appreciated to not want a second cup of coffee and trudge towards the lobby beacuse someone in housekeeping was thoughtful and generous. Anyway, for the price and what we get, this is a great place to stay. We've been here several years in a row, and will continue to book here. Also, if you want a good pizza or sub, Broadway Pizza deliveres from their location downtown. Food is definitely worth it, and the menu and phone number is on a card in the room.

I enjoyed the central courtyard with a pool large by today's standard (8.5 feet deep) and found the breakfast restaurant a welcome change from the normal continental breakfast lobby.

It's nice because it has a large king bed with a sofa sitting area. It has a small kitcknette with just a sink and a counter area.

This is one of the most deceitful hotels I've stayed in.

The guy was nice and friendly. We get to our room, and everything changed. The room smells awful. It smells like a combo of old stale smoke and paint. Our room looks nothing like the pictures. The furniture is not the same, it's a tiny chest at the foot of the bed with drawers, and then the tv is on a small end table looking thing. Certainly not the amoire shown in the pic. I go in the bathroom and there's not a bathtub (even thought the pics on the website show a bathtub) So I call the front desk. There are limited amounts of rooms with bathtubs and those were gone. So instead, we have this tiny shower in a corner that was dirty. So then we go to the spa. That was the only area that was the same as the pics. The pool was freezing cold so we skipped that but the spa was nice and clean. The jets don't work very well, but after a long day of walking around the zoo, just sitting in the hot water felt nice. That area is also very well kept, and nice looking. Then we tried to go to sleep, but the jets flying all night made that difficult. The next morning we go to get our free continental breakfast as advertised on the website and we were told they only have coffee. But on the website they show a whole breakfast room and everything. So I ask the clerk and he says, Oh I know the website says that, but I don't know why, we've never had continental breakfast here. So if you've never had it, why would you have a picture of it on your website and offer it??? False advertising?

It was a quick decision to take a short 2 day get-away to the West coast. It was to be the only vacation we would get for the whole year and had not had a vacation at all for the past year. If it happened at all we had to do it on a \u201cShoe-String\u201d budget and our schedule only allowed us 3 days total . We both lost our jobs over a year ago and have only been able to find much lower paying jobs since then. Things have been very \u201ctight\u201d financially for us so we were in a great debate as to wether we should take the trip or not. At the last minute ( 3 days before the planned departure date ) a very close friend gave us a few hundred dollars and said \u201cYou Should GO\u2026You need to just get away out of the area for a few days. Just go.\u201d So I hit the internet scouring the countryside for an inexpensive hotel for us to stay in. We found several potential candidates all between $58-$84 per night. I read and re-read all the user reviews and finally made our decision to stay at the Ramada Hotel & Conference Ctr. & glad we did. ( We did not experience most of what the negative sounding reviews talked about at this hotel ) First of all the on line photos made the Ramada look very upscale, tropical with all kinds of palm trees and flowers around it. Truly beautiful we thought. It looked much classier than the other hotel photos in this price range. ( Obviously this is what happens with on line photos and often when you arrive you find out that it is not what the photos implied ) but in the Ramadas\u2019 case we found that the on line photos DID indeed portray an accurate picture. The grounds we found to be well kept, very beautiful with lots of palm trees and flowers\u2026 a lot like an oasis in the dessert might be. When we arrived, the hotel desk staff , Sherry and Teo, were very attentive, professional and helpful. ( Thanks to you both keep up the great work !). We had booked the stay on line and had taken the Non-Smoking 1 King bed option. When we opened the door to our room we found that it had two queen size beds. We noticed the hotel is undergoing a systematic renovation of their rooms and we had been given a room that was very near where the new renovations were taking place.( Not so pretty and a little noisy ). The room was also on the side of the hotel that is right up next to the Miramar Air Station so you could hear the jets flying practice runs ( this may be a negative reason for some not to stay here but on the other hand, they usually fly only in the daylight hours & you probably won\u2019t be there during the daytime cause you\u2019ll be out at Seaworld right? ). Also there is a tall wall that does block a lot of the jet noises and they usually do not fly after dark I was told ( if this bothers you then just be sure your room is an INSIDE facing the pool room and you wont hear any of it and you\u2019ll be good to go ) For these reasons our 1st room was just not to our liking but I returned to the front desk and they were very helpful and patient in reaccommodating us to a room that was on the inside facing the lush pool and beautiful jacuzzi. Still 2 queens tho as all the 1 kings were the rooms being renovated. Our stay at the Ramada Hotel & Conference Ctr was wonderful. The room for this class & price of hotel was very clean, very quite, no Bugs of any kind were seen. The bathroom was immaculate. The bed linens were freshly pressed & the beds were comfortable ( have not slept this good in a long time ).The hot water was eternally hot ( yes ! ). The room had a mini refrigerator, ironing board and iron, airconditioner and color cable tv.. ALL of which worked perfectly. The outdoor pool and jacuzzi were ( from what we could tell ) crystal clear and super clean and HOT. Gotta say that for the $77.00 per night that it cost us to stay here we would give this hotel a huge thumbs up and highly recommend it as a wonderful place to stay if you want a clean, safe, bugfree, semi-luxurious (for the price), easy drive to get to everything and relaxing place to come back to.

When we got in the room, it smelled like smoke but we did not see an ashtray. Since we were advised that this was a smoking room, and we were so exhausted when we arrived, we figured that the maid had not left one on accident. We just used an ashtray that we had bought as a souvenier. The rooms were older and need to be updated and we had trouble with the toilet stopping up the entire time we were there. They sent maintenance a few times to plunge the toilet and the maintenance man saw us smoking and didn't say anything to us as did the maid.

Two days after we checked out, I discovered that they had charged us $100.00!

She actually did call back and told me that we had been charged $100.00 for smoking in a non smoking room. I was in shock and explained everything to her but she was rude and started argueing with me about it. She said that the lady I needed to speak to (the one who \"promised\" to call me back) would not be back until Tuesday (this is Saturday) and she would be the one I would have to discuss this matter with.

When staying in this area again, I will probably check out the Hampton Inn, which is right next door to the Ramada; however, if the price isn\u2019t \u2018right\u2019, we may be visiting the Ramada again.", "Date": "May 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "worldtravellers7", "ReviewID": "UR7556166", "Content": "My partner and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights when in San Diego in April for a getaway. We arrived and was greeted by Micheal on reception who was fantasic very helpful and funny. The check in was smooth and efficent we got a room at the front of the hotel overlooking the pool which was nice. The room was large and bed comfortble and we had a bath with a shower over it, The room was clean and maid service everyday. We weren't in the room very long as out doing things most days but was nice enough for when we were there. I dared to try the pool as people had said it was freezing and YES!! It was freezing but I managed to brave it and had a swim, I also tried out the jacuzzi which was lovely. In other reviews it stated you could hear everything through the walls well I have to say we didnt hear a peep except when people slammed their room doors. The hotel was situated in a convenient location and next to the freeway so easy to get to downtown San Diego (about 10-15mins drive). There was loads of resturants nearby and Dennys was just the other side of the freeway which was great as love the place. Micheal gave us a compiled list of resturants when checked in that we could check out unfortunetly we could only do so many as such a short time there, but ones we did try were nice ----- TIP: The soup plantation is great value for money and really nice food - all you can eat buffet for $8.99. We didn't check out the hotels resturant as we like to eat out when on holiday and see the different sights so can't comment on this but has got kareoke on wednesday nights. The only complaint I have is that on that night when arrived home from being out for dinner we only just managed to park the car in the carpark by our room as was full from people coming from all over (assuming locals) to the kareoke. Overall this hotel was a good choice for the money and I would deffinately reccomend to my friends and would deffinately stay again if in the area.", "Date": "May 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jupiter, FL", "Title": "\u201cBetter for business travelers than vacationers\u201d", "Author": "scoopcath", "ReviewID": "UR6590018", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this hotel for four nights over Christmas.

As I recall, one year another hotel even left us a Christmas present, including a stocking full of goodies. This hotel did not even offer housekeeping on Christmas day. We were promised a breakfast each day, but did not realize that breakfast ends at 9:00 am. We were on vacation, and slept in until around 8 am. By the time we got around to the dining room, breakfast was over. We did make it to breakfast one day. It was decent. They made a nice omelette fresh in the pan. The room was fine. There was a desk with one chair. When we brought in dinner one night, we took turns sitting at the desk to eat. They do offer free coffee in the lobby, but to save time one morning, we used the in-room coffee maker. Wow, what a mess! It leaked water all over the place. There was plenty of parking most days, but it did fill up at night. The shower head was quite low- tall husband had to bend in uncomfortable positions. Surprisingly quiet- close to freeway.
