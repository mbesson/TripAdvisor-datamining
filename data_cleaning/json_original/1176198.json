Our room (jacuzzi room with fireplace) was very clean and we found the bed to be very comfortable. Free wi-fi was a nice touch. The not so good: Oddly, the jacuzzi kept turning on by itself when it was empty - we had to call down after midnight to the front desk, where they somehow turned it off remotely. (As another reviewer mentioned, the fridge is also quite loud.) The awful: The hotel is surrounded by clubs, which means: loud music, loud talking/shouting as people wait in line to get into the clubs, constant beeping of car horns as people are dropped off/picked up, and finally - RIDICULOUSLY LOUD drunk people stumbling into the street in droves when the clubs close at 3:00am. It was so loud, we had to check to see if our window was actually open (it wasn't). We were very disappointed that the windows were not well insulated against this onslaught of sound. I would expect that a hotel in a club district - especially a hotel with the \"Hilton\" name - would make every effort to soundproof rooms and protect its guests from this noise. In total, we managed about 3 hours of sleep - definitely not the relaxing \"get-away\" I had planned. (Note:This was on a SUNDAY night, when one would assume the clubs would not be an issue.) So - while the hotel itself is quite nice, we will not return, and I would not recommend it unless you are an unusually heavy sleeper.

We didn't care for an option such a jaccuzi but it is interesting that all the numbers increased not only the room price! I was more tired than angry and i paid. *Parking costs 35$ (!) per night. I parked on a small parking 100m/yards from the hotel for 20$ per night (on widmer street ABOVE Adelaide street - not the big one which is UNDER adelaide street these guys are asking also for 35$, there's a small one on the other side 30m from Adelaide. *The quality of sleep (which for me matters for >80%) was bad as the quality of linens was just accepted, worst than any hilton we've ever stayed in and moreover the matress was...BAD not even mediocre.

It works much more than the normal (bad placed?) and the motor is very noisy, it wakes you up when it starts and when it stops and just disturbing while working. *As the hotel allows you to take the breakfast in your room (!!!) you will see people on pyjamas (!!) in the elevator holding milk and toasts or carrying fruits and butter and marmelade wearing their flip flops - for sure this is not a Hilton's image. All in all, i'm not saying avoid but also i do not recommend this hotel. Good luck whatever you choose to do in Toronto and enjoy your stay in the city!

The man there told us that at the hotel we can park the car for $35 and had to take it out before 1 pm whereas we can park it for $40 in his parking until 3 pm.

Although the Hotel is close to Eaton Centre and Yonge Street, the actually few blocks around the Hilton Garden is dark and sketchy at night. I would advise a taxi. It is only a three block ride to the Keg Mansion Steakhouse, and their is a Caseys fast food roadhouse joint for baskets of fast food and fries, not the greatest. Right beside the Hilton Gardens is a better Hotel called the Grand all done up in little white lights, but both locations are really off the beaten track. Jarvis Street is not the street to stroll at night. The Hotel suites fine for business travellors and might even have a small conference room . But for a luxtury travellor I would recommend the Royal York Fairmount Toronto, or Harbour Castle, or Four Seasons Yorkville, Hyatt Yorkville or the King Edward. Hilton Gardens is a small place that has recently done a reno, so if you want to be close to everything this location is suitable on the East side of town.

We started to get concerned at some of the surrounding businesses as we pulled up in the taxi, but once settled in, we found the location excellent. Just a few blocks from Yonge Street and the Eaton Centre and walking distance to everything else downtown T.O. has to offer.

The price is comparable to most downtown Toronto hotels, so I expected similar service & accommodations. This is not what we received. Here is a list of my complaints: 1. Difficult & unaccommodating customer service: I called to request early check-in a few days before arriving, as I typically do with other hotels. Instead of ensuring I would receive early check-in at my required time, I was told they cannot grant this request in advance & I need to call the morning of my arrival. I did this the morning we were to arrive & they again said they cannot grant this request until I actually arrive at the hotel & they will see if there are any rooms available. I find this lack of customer service very disappointing, considering I have never received such poor treatment at the usual hotels I stay at (Westin, Marriot & InterCon). When we arrived I requested late check-out, since my husband is in the marathon & it is not humanly possible for us to check out at noon. They said I must request this on the morning of check out. To me, this again is VERY unaccommodating, as I have many other tasks that take precedence the morning of a marathon. I consider my request a very standard one & not at all out of the ordinary, however, the Hilton wouldn't grant it. The morning we were scheduled to check-out, I went to the front desk to request late check-out. I was told that was impossible & I must check out at noon or I would be charged a half day room fee. I told them this is disappointing, as we typically stay at the InterCon the night before my husband's marathon & they are more than willing to grant late check-out. Upon hearing this, the clerk granted me a 3 p.m. check out, but made it seem like he was moving mountains for me (eye roll). 2. Fire alarms & other disturbing noise: There was a fire alarm at 7 a.m. for no apparent reason. I checked with the front desk what the issue was & was told it was a false alarm. It would have been nice if they had notified the guests! There is also a lot of street noise surrounding this hotel, as the windows have not been properly insulated against sound. Lastly, there are many mechanical noises within the hotel room itself, from the vent system & fridge. We had to shut everything off in order for my husband to get a decent sleep before his marathon. There was no way, however, to control the street noise, which was very stressful & caused lack of sleep. 3. Parking: We were told to park from noon on Saturday until 3 p.m. on Sunday would cost $70, as this is considered two days of parking. Apparently a new \"day\" starts at 2 p.m. Clearly this was ridiculous & we parked elsewhere....FOR FREE! 4. Unauthorized credit card charges: Now that I am back home I see my credit card on file has in fact been charged for the \"half day room fee\" because of my 3 hour late check-out. I was guaranteed at the front desk that I would NOT be charged, but my credit card has been charged $75 without my authorization. I guess I can add fraud to the list of complaints against this hotel?", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cSleep-optional hotel\u201d", "Author": "JJJC_Family", "ReviewID": "UR119310886", "Content": "First, I'll give you the good news. It's a pretty new and attractive property. It's right downtown. The room, itself was quite nice. They had good cookies upon arrival. Now, I'll give you the bad. The hotel is right next to a night club, which we did not know beforehand. We got in on a Saturday about 5PM, went to a quick dinner and then went to Cirque du Soleil's Totem. We were in a good mood as we headed back to the hotel to sleep. When we got out of the car, we saw a large crowd and heard very, very loud music coming from the club. Then we walked to the entrance of the hotel, which is on the narrow alley that separates it from the night club. By the front door, was a guy trying to console a girl whose head was down and appeared to be extremely unhappy. At first, I was scared that he might be threatening to her, but then realized he was concerned that she was so unhappy and not responding to him. Regardless, it was a little disconcerting that they chose to seek refuge right at the entrance of the hotel. What if he truly was violent? OK. Then we went upstairs to our room on the 12th floor. We expected that being so high, we would be immunized against the noise coming from the night club. Wrong! Our room was almost directly across from it and worse they had a patio there from which they belched the music. It was perhaps midnight or later. We hoped to be able to stay, but the intensity of the music was intolerable. Then we realized that the situation was worse then we thought. Very loud music was also coming from the room next door, apparently partying. We called the front desk and explained the situation and a guy came up. He was very nice. He told us that they had called the folks next door and told them they had to be quiet ( we suspected as much, because we heard some very loud and unhappy comments emanating from the room as a result). Unfortunately, he said the hotel could do nothing about the club. I had told the desk and him that we would have to be moved. He understood and said that we were by no means the first people to complain about this aspect of the hotel's location. Indeed, it seemed this was an intractable problem that the staff regularly had to deal with and endure the anger and frustration of guests who could not sleep. He said they would move us to the other side of the building where we would not hear the noise. I thanked him. We moved. Unfortunately, the room they moved us to had only one bed and we had 3 people. It had a sofa bed. I was unhappy, because we had paid for a 2 queen room. He said that all the 2 queen rooms faced the night club and all would have the same noise problem. Both my 87 year old mother and I tried the sofa bed and it was the worst sofabed I had ever seen. It had this extremely thin mattress and it was like sleeping on the metal frame. I told him it was unacceptable and said that they would have to supply a second room so we could all get some sleep. He called down to the front desk and they wanted to bring a second bed up into the room. I wasn't crazy about this, but I said ok, at first. Then I asked if they were intending on taking out the sofa to make room for the bed and they said no. I told him that it would be impossible to get the bed in otherwise and that even with taking the sofa out, it would be impossible to move in the room with the 2nd bed in there. I then demanded that they give a 2nd room and told them that I absolutely expected to not pay for anything for either room as it was now past 1AM and I was so upset that I knew I wouldn't sleep and my 87 year old mother was very upset and incredibly tired. Very reluctantly they got me a 2nd room, but told me I would have to pay for 1 room. I told them that I expected to be comped for everything. I paid for a room where I could get a good night sleep and they had not delivered that. I told them that I had paid for a premium hotel for precisely that reason. They told me they could not control outside noise. I said that was ridiculous, that every city had laws precisely prohibiting disturbing the peace of others and that it was even more ridiculous to have a hotel where they knew guests could not get a good night's sleep. That is the most basic function of a hotel. They said they could not authorize comping the room, that only the manager could do that and that she would not be in until next morning. I informed them that if I was not comped, I would dispute the charge with American Express. Nonetheless, I apologized to them for yelling and told them I realized that there was a limited amount they personally could do. They couldn't physically move the hotel that night and probably their hands were tied re: what they could offer guests. I then went to my room and took a shower. When I went to sleep, I then realized the room was not as quiet as they advertised. I could still hear the music, definitely lower than the other room, but enough to keep me awake. Plus, now I was on the 4th floor and there was lots of street noise from people outside having a good time. Worse, hotel guests came in and made lots of noise as they went back to their rooms. At 3AM, I called the front desk and plaintively asked if the music ever stopped. I was told that it should end by 2:45AM. Apparently, he didn't know what time it was and was a bit flustered when I explained that it was already 3AM. He said the music would end soon. I finally got to sleep at 4AM, as my tiredness and sleeping pill kicked in. Unfortuantely, at 5AM a particularly loud and obnoxious group of guests came in and woke me up. I tried to get back to sleep, but starting around 6AM, guesrs started leaving their rooms either to go to breakfast or check out. Hands down, this was the absolute worst night I endured in any hotel and that is saying a lot, as I have experienced some truly terrible nights before this. I told my wife that she would have to deal with the hotel re: billing, because I would blow my top if I spoke to them. She was told that the manager was not there. She asked them to call her. They said she was in church. She said we would go to breakfast and hoped that they could contact her. They said they would call my wife when they heard from her. Luckily, she agreed to comp the entire bill. Regardless, I wanted a good night sleep. We wanted to go sightseeing and everyone was dead and we did nothing the whole day. Fortunately, we had not purchased tickets for anything or it would have been a further disaster. As it is, it wasted a precious vacation day and the experience left us tired for the next several days. To be honest, I believe that it is possible to have a wonderful time at the hotel, under the right circumstances. However, I would not recommend going to this hotel if you want to be sure you get a good night's sleep. As the desk clerk said, they cannot control outside noise and when the night club is in full swing there is a lot of noise. Nor can they control other guests coming in at all hours of the night making lots of noise as they return to their rooms, probably from partying, themselves. They can control other guests partying and making lots of noise, but that takes calling them and waiting until the guests actually settle down. I hope the hotel finds solutions to these problems, because physically it is a fine property.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quebec City, Quebec", "Title": "\u201cHilton does it right\u201d", "Author": "MimiDot", "ReviewID": "UR119187732", "Content": "Spent the Thanksgiving weekend at the Hilton Garden Inn on Peter St. A lovely, clean, modern hotel downtown.

For the business traveler it is a very sensible choice. The location is good - a short walk to the financial district (where I do most of my business). By short I mean 10-15 minutes. It's a bit far from the Subway, more so than the Hilton/Sheraton on Richmond St. The rooms are roomy, clean, and comfortable, and the amenities are nice. Free Internet is always appreciated, as are Herman Miller chairs - I've spend hours working from my hotel room until late at night, and having a comfy chair is a huge plus. Prices are typically lower than the Hilton or Sheraton, and I actually prefer the rooms at the Garden Inn to both. Lots of restaurants to choose from - from tourist traps in the theatre district to cheap eateries on Spedina. Use Urbanspoon to find what you're looking for. It's always the first hotel I look up when I need to book a Toronto trip. Tip - there's a club right next to the hotel. I have never had any issues with noise, but a colleague of mine was staying and apparently had a room directly facing the club, resulting in lots of late night noise.

After reading the negative reviews for that hotel, I chose to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn because of the positive reviews on TA and also because I'm a Hilton Diamond member. The Hyatt proved incredibly disappointing as a conference venue and other attendees said the rooms there were disappointing also. The Hilton Garden Inn seemed a good option but I'd consider the Soho Metropolitan if I was looking for a more luxe experience. The rooms are mid sized... comfortable for one or two people but tight for more than that. The furniture and furnishings are newish, which befits the age of the hotel. The washroom was a bit cramped but there was decent water pressure for the shower. There is plenty of closet space and a large chest of drawers for clothing. The bed was comfortable, with plenty of pillows. The flat screen TV was set up prominently in the room. One bug was they didn't seem to ever get the newspapers on time to be delivered to the rooms in the morning --on only one morning did I wake up to find it outside my door. The free wi-fi strength wavered --it was strong in non peak hours but painfully slow in the morning and also before bedtime. Housekeeping was consistent but I tipped every day of my stay (and received thank you notes from the grateful staff). I bypassed the free breakfast so I can't rate on the quality of the offering. I ordered one meal from room service. Apparently the kitchen was quite busy that night due to heavy rain. Although it took me five minutes to get through, my food arrived within 15 minutes and was of decent quality for a burger and fries. The hotel is within walking distance of the everything in the entertainment district. There is a Shoppers Drug Mart, a LCBO liquor store and a natural food market within a two block radius --all of which are necessities for regular travelers, IMHO. There are also multiple restaurants and fast food locations close by. Other Toronto sites such as City Hall, Eaton Centre, etc are within a 10 minute walk. There are three street car lines within three blocks, although the subway is a further walk away. Service at the front desk is efficient, though not especially welcoming.

Since we were really tired we missed the sign that said we needed to slide out key to open the door and we proceeded to simply slide the door open without swiping. The door slid and on the otherside we were greeted by the rudest employee!! We apologized for missing the sign and he made us go back out and swipe our card and enter back in like we were some kind of criminals.! He then went on to demean us by saying \" That is the first and last time this happens!\" while raising his voice.Meaning 1st and last time we forget to swipe our key. I was too in shock to ask for his manager as his behaviour was out of bounds! We missed the sign by accident, give me a break! How could he be so rude. I walked away quite stunned and upset.

Actually, dinner was of better quality than I was expecting since this wasn't a full service Hilton. yet the restaurant had the same high quality as the big box Hilton. The prices were comparative to the restaurants in the neighborhood with the difference that service was much better and of course there was the convenience. There was even a decent wine selction and a waiter that offered reliable advice. Someone invested in training the staff and it showed. The hotel also had professional trained desk personnel. I was checking in and waiting while one of the people at the desk was providing directions to a guest. Sometimes desk people can have an attitude, but not this woman.

We don't even look around anymore. If we know we're going to stay downtown, this is where we book. Pros: -The rooms are in the best condition you could want. The hotel is only a few years old, and it's one of the newest-feeling and cleanest hotels around. The house keeeping staff is excellent, and friendly if you meet them in the halls. The rooms are also pretty spacious for big city hotel rooms. The bathrooms are a very good size. If you treat yourself to a jacuzzi room (tub beside the bed), you'll have all the room two people could possibly want. As Hilton Diamond VIP members (which we were the last couple of years), we were entitled to upgrades to the jacuzzi room if one was available. I think we had pretty much a 100% success rate with upgrades over the space of 2 years. So when you're checking in, it doesn't hurt to ask. ;) - The beds are the sleep number beds, which many people love. I personally don't think they're as spectacular as the hype, but there's no doubt that these hotel beds are absolutely comfortable, and the bedding is plush with lots of pillows. -The location is excellent for nightlife, shopping, dining, and only minutes walk to the Rogers centre for Jays games or other events. There's also an excellent diner at the corner with great diner-style breakfasts and breakfast burritos. Going to the other corner, there's a great new higher end burger place that's just opened. If you don't mind walking 10 min. or so, you're also not far away from Dark Horse espresso bar for a great fair trade coffee or cappuccino. Just a couple minutes to King St. and you're in the theatre district with ample choice of medium and high end restaurants. You're surrounded by so much shopping (Shoppers Drug Mart, Chapters, liquor store, Queen St. West, Eaton Centre a bit of a walk away) that I couldn't possibly list everything. The less than perfect (because so much of this hotel is quite perfect): - I'm not sure I have ever been able to print successfully from the business centre! We haven't tried in a long time, but when we stayed a couple of summers ago for most of the summer, you had to print from your laptop to the web printing service that gives you a choice of which location worldwide where you want your document to print. Then you create a PIN number, and you're supposed to be able to go down the printer and enter the PIN number to retrieve your document. This isn't the first hotel I've had trouble with that particular system. The business centre is quite small, located off the lobby, and since we always bring our own laptops, printing is the only use we would ever have for it. - The lobby is pretty small, and usually quite crowded. Since the hotel is so close to Rogers Centre, the lobby is also a pretty common gathering place for groups of people staying together. It can be difficult to tell who is in line to speak to the front desk vs. who's milling about. Once you get 2 - 3 people in line for the front desk, it can take a bit of maneuvering even just to pass by. - We don't drive, so it doesn't affect us, but we do hear other guests in the lobby (since it's always so crowded) complaining about the fees for parking. Unfortunately, it's downtown Toronto and there simply aren't many options available. Guests used to cities like New York probably don't think twice about it, but other Canadians from out of town will likely notice. - Because we are constantly on the road, we usually prefer hotels with kitchenettes. Going to a hotel isn't usually a \"treat\" for us since we're so often traveling and we get sick of having to spend the time and money to go out for every meal. Fortunately, there is so much good food very close by, including quick and take out food if you don't feel like spending a lot of time out. The rooms do have microwaves and bar fridges so we can bring back leftovers or pick up a few grocery items at the large Shoppers Drug Mart on the corner. In some other places we stay, the lack of a kitchenette suite would be a drag. But in this location it worked out, even when we stayed for weeks at a time. - The rates aren't cheap enough to make you feel like you're getting a discount, but the service and rooms are just so consistently excellent, in a location that can't be beat, that we feel it's worth booking specifically rather than using Hotwire to get the best deal we can. At least we know what we're getting, and we are getting value for our money, even if we're spending more than we usually have to for a downtown hotel room through a discount service.

That was a bit of a pain, but understandable, because it was getting extremely rowdy and it was clear people were bringing in about 10 people into one room. This night was a bit of a mess; we would walk out to the hallway and smell weed, hear loud music blasting, etc. Every other time we had no problems, however there are only 2 elevators and they DO take a while, especially that night. Excellent rooms. We usually get the 2 queen beds, very spacious, comfortable, clean. Washroom is big too, lots of counter space (which is handy when you have 4 girls doing their hair and makeup). A HUGE plus is that there's a microwave and mini-fridge in every room! Staff is also very friendly and accommodating. If you want to check in early (it's usually 3pm), call in advance and many times they have some rooms that are ready, and they'll let you in with no extra charge.

I will try to keep this review as concise as possible but I have a lot to say! The location was very centrally located in the downtown Toronto area. Actually, the hotel is located in the \"Entertainment District\" which, for a business-minded hotel, might not make the best sense. Unfortunately, I arrived around 11pm on a Saturday night and the street outside the entrance to the hotel was crowded with \"club-goers\", and crowds which needed some more control/restraint. The transportation from the airport (Airport Express) refused to drive down the street the hotel is located on due to how busy and congested it was requiring me to walk two blocks in a suit, with my luggage through a busy crowd! Upon my final arrival, I found the hotel lobby door was locked and took a few minutes of struggling in order to gain entrance. As I had requested weeks in advance, the \"quiet room\" was not available and I was told that I could switch if it was too loud. The room given was facing a club's alley where there were people outside all night playing cards and drinking/smoking making for a terrible first night of rest after a long day of traveling. I was told that although my request for room location and king bed was not granted, the hotel was \"full\" and there was nothing they could do. As a upper level HHonors member, I found this unacceptable, yet, I continued to endure and eventually the clubs closed and the weekend passed making for a more quiet week of sleep. Overall the building itself was immaculate, very clean and modern. The cleaning staff were very good and eager to please. A microwave and fridge in the room catered to my \"doggy bags.\" The pool area and jacuzzi were well maintained and tended to every shift. The business center had two newer computers with printing and fax services available. Free high speed wired and wireless internet was great. The lobby was small but inviting. Although, they should have had coffee/tea and/or water available 24 hours daily instead of sporadically as they did during my stay. The cookies, which I was not offered upon check-in were nice but somewhat stale tasting. One issue which arose every morning was in retrieving a taxi cab. You would think that there would be a taxi cab stand or quick access to a taxi cab in the morning at this hotel, unfortunately, this was not the case and upon more than two occasions was delayed in my departure even after calling 15 minutes in advance in order to have a taxi waiting for departure. Since this was my first visit to Toronto I had desired some information regarding places to visit and see. Although helpful, they were not that knowledgeable regarding these questions and I found it to be disheartening. There was major disparity in quality of service between the day and night shift workers. Some extra training in customer service skills is warranted for the night shift workers as they were not that attentive nor friendly to my questions or requests. Overall my stay at the HGI Toronto Downtown was satisfactory. I do not think that the price of the stay $200 CAD/night was justified given the above, however, perhaps this is the normal expectation in a downtown Toronto Hotel. My suggestion for the hotel management is that they work on customer service and satisfaction as this was a frequent theme that seemed to be present throughout my stay. I was never asked if there was anything they could do for me....something that I have come to expect at Hilton Brand hotels which has kept me frequently returning for many many stays.

The hotel is located in a perfect spot downtown, in the Theater District/Entertainment District and was well within walking distance to some of the major attractions. The price was good, the rooms clean and the staff very friendly. They have complementary coffee in the morning downstairs (not the gross room coffee), a restaurant and fresh baked cookies in the evening. The rooms had a nice flat screen TV and a small fridge to store any items in. The parking is a bit on the steep side at $35 but I assume that this might be the going rate for most hotels in the Toronto area. There are plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance as well as some Theaters and the Second City. However, the hotel is located right next to a nightclub. The room we had looked out onto the nightclub's back patio. We heard it on Friday night and it wasn't too loud and was tolerable. Saturday night was a different story though. The music at the nightclub was very loud until 2 AM and we heard people down at the patio screaming until 3 AM. To make matters a bit worse, there seemed to be large groups of young people there on Sat night and we had a group of very noisy neighbors. Those two things combined, the nightclub and the noisy neighbors made it a very difficult night on Saturday. To the hotel's credit, they did comp us our night for Saturday and did give us a free breakfast which was actually very tasty. We asked to move rooms first, but they did not have any available away from the nightclub. (Probably since those who complained earlier had already moved!) While I don't mind some noise in the night, the particular night we were there was not tolerable. It was probably our bad luck for being there near spring break. I would recommend this hotel for younger people who would like to be right in the middle of the Entertainment District or for those that don't mind a bit of noise or are night owls. If you are sensitive to noise, I would suggest maybe staying here during the week and not on a weekend.

We enjoyed a buffet breakfast at the hotel restaurant on Sunday morning and then we called the valet parking to get our cars (two cars for the 8 of us).

Great location, easy walking distance to Roger's Skydome, CN Tower, Conv. Centre, Theatre District. etc. Fairly new property, well appointed room, very clean with a good bed, free high speed internet and a fridge and microwave included in room. Decent toiletries and a neat walk in glass shower with multiple shower heads (big enough for two, if you are inclined) All of the staff that we came into contact with were very polite and seemed eager to please. As other's have pointed out, there are several nightclubs located nearby, and on a weekend, there is a lot of commotion in the neighbourhood but it didn't bother us. The front desk staff asked if we wanted a room on a high floor, which worked well to keep us away from the noise. It wasn't stated, but I got the impression that they were trying to keep the younger party crowd on the lower floors and the quieter folks on the upper. Many of the rooms have adjoining doors, and they aren't very soundproof. We could easily hear the people in the next room as they got ready to go out for the evening, but quite frankly it wasn't a bother and we didn't hear them come in later either. We took their Bed and Breakfast deal which included a hot breakfast in the dining room. Had a good omellete, nice choice of breads, cereal, fruit, yogurts, juices coffee etc. Had read here about the expensive parking, but we found a great underground parking lot about a block and a half south at 277 Wellington that was only $5 for the night. Pretty tricky getting into in the morning however (there was no staff on the Sunday morning) so if you use it, be sure to ask the attendant to give you the entry code for the ramp, otherwise you can't get in to get your car if the attendant is not present. During the week I imagine it is not a problem. I thought the hotel to be a good value for what we paid, and yes, it did look a bit like a hooker convention with the way some of the younger crowd were dressed heading to the clubs, but I feel that the great location more than made up for that. If you're going to be bothered with it, pay the extra $50 or $80 a night and stay down the street at the Soho Metropolitan, or over at the Hyatt on Adelaide. As someone else complained about, there is security in the lobby at night and they were controlling who came and went, but quite frankly I saw that as a definite plus.

Some caveats: The valet parking [only option] is $35 CAD. They use industrial-style elevators to move your car to lower floors, so trained operators are needed. Searching around for alternate parking in the area is a crapshoot, as much parking in the area [only a few blocks from the Rogers Centre/Skydome and inside the Entertainment District] is outdoors and prices are jacked up for events and weekends. I was able to jerk the system a bit by parking elsewhere and walking a couple blocks. Otherwise the room was clean [and cleaned], the fridge and microwave worked too. And the free internet is speedy.

It took me a while to figure out the operation of the shower as there are 3 options: Standard hand-held shower, standard fixed shower head and \"body\" shower. You can only get one of those working at any time by turning the know 90 degrees to the right (body), 45 degress to the right (fixed) or 45 degrees to the left (hand-held).
