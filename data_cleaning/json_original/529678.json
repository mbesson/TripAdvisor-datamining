A lovely clean and modern hotel. The rooms are on the small side and they seem to have quite a few snags that need to be ironed out. There are NONE of the advertised facitities, i.e. room service, restaurant, spa, beauty salon etc and as these were facilities were the main reason that we booked the hotel for a relaxing pampering weekend we were very disapointed to find them all missing. The staff were very nice and helpful and the breakfasts were excellant. The road works out the front and the building site at the back ididn't help the noise level as it all started up at 8am and carried on all day. I'm sure that as soon as they iron out these problems the hotel will be worth a second visit.", "Date": "Apr 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR556270930", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "sjl115"}, {"Content": "A different hotel now? I stayed at this hotel at Easter 08 and couldn't have had a more different experience than Stuarttaylor. It appears the hotel is newly renovated plus according to the manager, they are currently adding more rooms (thus explaining the construction site next door).The hotel was beautiful, the service excellent, the room very nice (all new) and the staff lovely. I am struggling to find something to criticise - the only things that could be improved in my opinion were the pillows (not up to the quality of the rest of the room) and the room lighting (a little too dull for reading at night). There is a tramway being constructed out the front of the hotel but that didn't have any adverse affect (it may have been an advantage because the road was essentially blocked to through traffic for the period of my stay).I have already recommended this hotel to a couple of my friends.", "Date": "Apr 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR953363367", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "businesstraveller060"}, {"Content": "Un tr\u8305s bon hotel   showReview(23308989, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 6, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR191778483", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "PaulBeziers"}, {"Content": "ATTENZIONE!!! non accettate la...   showReview(21417932, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR890835298", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Hotel economico che si trova di...   showReview(20890620, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR639076519", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Bel h\u4e48tel proche de la gare   showReview(18542158, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR709928556", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Ottimo albergo, i lavori in...   showReview(16728405, 'full');", "Date": "May 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR326719868", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "h\u4e48tel tr\u732bs sympa et tr\u732bs bien situ\u8305   showReview(15577451, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR478900897", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "nous avons apprs\u8305ci\u8305 que cet h\u4e48tel n'est pas loin de centre ville et de monument   showReview(15577450, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR760463799", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Habitaci\u8d38n doble espaciosa y...   showReview(16726548, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR533554174", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Materassi molto scomodi e nessuna possibilita' di cambiare stanza/materasso...   showReview(13985021, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR583227301", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Reci\u8305n estrenado       ba\u5e3do", "Date": "Oct 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR609302030", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "tubular"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d529678-r21054948-Hotel_Embassy-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "529678", "Price": "$238"}}
