A cot was provided for us and it was clean, with clean bedding for him, and I had no worries about him sleeping in it (apart from his snoring!!). The only slight complaint is that it is next to a busy road and the road noise in the morning was quite loud. Not the hotels fault but it may be something to think about if you have young children with you, or you like to sleep in. We had breakfast, which was very busy but we were seated relatively quickly and the food was more than enough for a busy days sightseeing in London (its only 10 minute walk to the tube station).

I had a room on the top floor, on the front, but the traffic noise was not a problem with the double glazing. Whether this would be the same in the summer if I had to open a window I don't know. The wider area all around Edgware seems to be fairly good and the ride outr of central London on the tube or bus passes through some very affluent residential areas, but the immediate surroundings to the hotel, especially Burnt Oak Broadway, is quite run down wirth many closed down shops. However, one night I visited a friend in Hampstead and when returning on the night bus at about 2am I felt quite safe walking the short diastance from the bus stop. This was a great place to stay for just 2 nifghts but if I was staying for longer I think I would find the walk to the tube and the long distance into cental Lodon quite tedious, but then thousands of people do this journey commuting to work every day!

Nevertheless my room was spotlessly clean, the staff were very pleasant and keen to help, and the food in the restaurant was surprisingly good. The surrounding area is busy and my room looked onto the road. However the road noise is minimal at night and didn't disturb my sleep. I see what some reviewers say about the cloud of cigarette smoke around the door.

My only gripe would be that you could hear the people in the room above us walking around and also the people below us could apparently hear us, so the floors must be very thin. A short walk to the tube station and as it was snowy & icy we got a taxi back which only cost us \u00c2\u00a33.60. Lovely breakfast, good choice of hot & cold buffett. Staff were very friendly.

Chose the breakfast and dinner package which came to \u00c2\u00a398 per night which was the most expensive i have paid for a premier inn. Check in was swift but they did mess up the reservation and wanted to cahrge me extra \u00c2\u00a37.50 for breakfast but after they rechecked they found that i have already booked it as part of my package. The corridors can only be accessed with your room card which is good. The same card is also used to enter and exit the car park. But the card failed after one night and had to be reset!!! Dinner was adeqaute with reasonable choice including a drink but next time if i stay, i would just walk 5 minutes down the road since there seem to be some restaurants there which probably serve better food. Breakfast was good with cooked and continental choice (different rates) and the hostess was extremely customer orientated and couldnt do enough. The rooms are standard premier inn affair with comfortable bed and pillows and TV. Second night i stayed there was woken up at 3 am by some alarm which kept going till 7 am and so didnt sleep well, but on basis of their good night guarantee i was refunded a nights stay which was excellent customer service. Overall would recommend for a short trip since comfy rooms with free parking but would look for special deals since room alone at nearly \u00c2\u00a375 is quite expensive for a premier inn.", "Date": "December 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Staffordshire", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant!\u201d", "Author": "ALEXW1993", "ReviewID": "UR36545577", "Content": "Stayed twice now, very convinient for central london, (only 40 min tube ride away) with FREE on-site parking, and and only 10 mins slow walk away from Edgware tube station!

We arrived in Edgware at around 10.00am. we got there and were hoping to leave our bags, as it was way to early to check in, as that was not untill 3.00pm! We reported to reception, explained we were going to the London 2012 party in the Mall. The receptionist then went off, and pleasantly told us that she would get someone to clean the room, so we could check in, and not have to come back from central London!

The hotel was easy to find- straight off the M1. It is a 10 minute walk to the underground- Northern Line, Edgware. And a 10 minute bus ride to Collingdale underground. We got a pass for the bus and underground, so we got the bus sometimes- just because we were lazy!- as the stop was right outside the hotel. Bus number 303, 142 to Collingdale underground on the Northern line. The hotel is well lit and accross the road from numerous shops, takeaways etc. we opted for the breakfast at 7 pounds a night- very good, full cooked with vege option and plenty of cereals, juices etc... worth the money. The room was large with clean linen and carpets. tv and phone, good bathroom with towels and shampoos etc. The only problem we had was, it was FAR to hot in the room- no air con, and you couldn't open the window. It was hard to get a good nights sleep because of the heat which left us abit tired in the morning....we complained to the desk who gave us a fan- it didnt work....I can handle the heat but this was unbearable- for this reason we wouldn't stay here again.

I was not disappointed though. Excellent staff who seemed genuine and extremely helpful. The room was average size for a chain hotel but the bed was huge and really comfortable. Bathroom nice and clean and everything worked. Brilliantly powerful shower! Last time I was in London on business I stayed in a Jurys but this room was much better and quieter. Having free and secure parking was also a bonus. I ate in the bar and this was where I deducted marks. I ordered a typical burger type bar meal, which was delicious by the way, and was offered \"any sauces to go with that\" I said yes to two that were offrered. Foolishly I expected these to be either free, as in any burger chain, or for a minimal charge. I was charged \u00c2\u00a3 3.50! This increased the price of a bar meal at around \u00c2\u00a310.00 by 35%! Bad practice, I think. What a shame because otherwise I would have given the hotel top marks for a budget stay in London.
