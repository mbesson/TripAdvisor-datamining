February was a good time to visit as it was not overly busy in Venice and the weather is just warming up. The room was of a high standard and kept clean. As there are only 7 rooms it was quiet at all times and we only come across one other couple during our stay so we felt like we were the only guests. The service received from the staff was very personal, we had the breakfast room to ourselves and had coffee, eggs and bacon made to our liking. The breakfast was delicious and excellent quality. The staff were always on hand to recommend local restaurants and attractions. We were recommended Aqua Pasta which was an excellent choice. We went for a stroll in the evening near to the hotel and it was soooooo peaceful you could hear a pin drop. We didn't see anybody else around, this truly is the ideal location to get away from it all and kick back and relax after a long day. My tip is see what the real Venice has to offer and just keep walking down narrow alleys in the opposite direction to everybody else, you will get some stunning photos.

Yet I got a very, very, very small room that was falling apart, and a terrible service. I really regret I picked this hotel. Our 2 nights stay was a true disaster. A \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boutique\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel cannot fail at providing basic services. I enlist some issues I encountered: 1.- The mattress in our bed was old, it had 2 holes with the shape of a person, on each side of the bed. You cannot have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boutique\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel with that kind of matresses!!!! It was extremely deformed!!!! (See pictures) 2.- The floor on our room was uneven. We stayed at room A. It seems the floor is sinking in the center of the room. The floor itself has a slope of at least 4-5 degrees. Our luggage (with wheels) moved because of the floor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slope. Why isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the floor straight?? Even?? That is a structural failure on the building that you should be fixed ASAP. (See pictures) 3.- Hot water.... If other guests were having a shower at the same time we were trying to shower, it would become a hot water war. How can the hotel say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boutique\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel if they can\u00c2\u00b4t guarantee hot water for ALL the guests!!!! 4.- We found that the Hotel has women-only personnel, therefore I had to help carry my heavy luggage to my room. I love women working at hotels; they always seem to know how to make your stay better. Yet they should always have someone who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong enough to move and carry luggage!!! Specially if the hotel is so little and corridors and stairs are so tiny. 5.- English speaking..... on our checkout, the lady that charged our credit card did not speak English. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even knew how to operate the CC terminal, she said my CC was declined 3 times, when I had to tell her how to use the terminal, and my CC did go through. But the worst part was she could not speak proper English, I felt she did not understand me and I could barely understand her. I speak fluent English, Spanish and French and I was unable to properly communicate with her. 6.-Service... I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a farewell, goodbye, not even a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have a good day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd phrase when I left. The lady gave me my voucher and a handwritten little receipt; she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even ask if I had a pleasant stay!!!! I read incredible reviews about The Charming House, I saw it listed in amazing lists, I was expecting a true Boutique Hotel. Unfortunately, I found an old hotel, I felt like it used to be an amazing hotel, but management totally forgot what a boutique hotel is about. The core business of a hotel must be providing the best sleep among the best services available. Yet DD724 failed in providing a decent mattress, failed in providing a room with decent flooring, failed in providing hot water, you failed as a Boutique Hotel, I am so disappointed!!!", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shanghai, Shanghai, China", "Title": "\u201chad a great experience\u201d", "Author": "Gregory Y", "ReviewID": "UR120864327", "Content": "what a charming and great experience we had, we originally were going to spend three days in Venice and ended up spending five. great location, great staff, great facilities, great city. what more can we say....it was worth everything....", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cDidn't like my stay\u201d", "Author": "JSPrima", "ReviewID": "UR120547535", "Content": "My experience was so different than the posts listed here.

The reception was squashed into a tiny space of about 2 sqm (!) and generally the guest areas such as the breakfast room and lounge were simply too small to be truly comfortable. Being an intimate hotel (yet clearly not owner-managed) - it also lacked the attention to personal service and hospitality that one ususally finds in smaller boutique establishments.

There were some design oversights such as having no power points to plug in the appliances they equip you with (such as a juicer and toaster) so we plugged out juicer in on the floor and the toaster was in the lounge. Their in-room internet system would not display any images which made checking the news and weather etc impossible. Very small points but there are a few of them.

Let me first say we were really, really looking forward to the DD724 and arrived with the utmost of hopes. That said, read below. Before arriving we were in contact via email with the office staff who kindly setup dinner reservations for us during our stay. We soon found out that the front office staff is far more helpful and kind through email compared to in person. Upon arrival I had assumed that we would be presented with a confirmation card of the restaurants they booked and the times. Nope, not even a mention. When I mentioned it to her she sternly told us the restaurant and time of the our dinner that night but no mention of the other nights. OK, not a big deal we will ask tomorrow. When taken to our room the woman told us the air conditioning was too low and we told her that it actually felt nice and that we liked it cool in the room. We left the room and went out for about 30 minutes. When we came back somebody had been in the room and turned the air conditioning to a warmer setting. If they do not want you to use air conditioning they should not provide it in the room. Our second day there was a different woman in charge of the front office, I was happy about that thinking she might have a better attitude. Nope, I was wrong. When we bumped into her in the hall and told her we needed to know what restaurant and time we had booked for the night she told us \"I'm busy, I'lll check later\". We could not believe it. This was also the woman that told us she had confirmed a rental car for us on the day of our check out but upon arrival to the rental location they informed us otherwise. The only person that gave good service was the woman that does breakfast. She does not speak English but was very kind and helpful. She really seemed to care about what she was doing and about how we felt. The other ladys at the front desk did not share the same attitude. As for the look and feel of the Inn, it does have a nice modern style and our room was decent size. However, the upkeep is lacking. During our entire stay there were numerous lights in the halls and stairwell that were burnt out and never changed. There were a lot of chunks missing in the walls of our room and the halls. The mattress and pillows in our room were really, really bad. It was like sleeping on cardboard. The blanket on our bed was also dirty. Our bathroom shower did not have a door or shower curtain so water went EVERYWHERE. It also only had a hand held shower head, nothing overhead.

Waken up with the noise of the kitchen at 7 am and at 8 am they started putting the frozen croissants (viewed them in the fridge so it is completely true) in the oven so the result was lilke sleeping in a bakery. no privacy at all. njust 4 tables for breakfast so if you are not quick in the morning you have to queue up. they offer you an 8% discount on cash payment and once I withdraw the money, pay my bank comission they do not want to accept as they told me I had to confirm it the first day!!! completely stupid. When I asked for a complaint book they told me they do not have it... REally a disaster. I agree with some of the prior users and I highly recommend the Ca Pisani since I was doubting between the 2 and this last one has nothing to do with the dd724.", "Date": "July 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cModern Design in Venice\u201d", "Author": "mattkorey", "ReviewID": "UR5368347", "Content": "The Charming House is quite the contrast to the city around it, but that's just the point. And even more so if you are a big fan of design hotels, which is right up my alley. This place is quite small and intimate and fantastically decorated. There were no views to speak of, at least not from our room, but the view inside was really more than enough with the way the hotel was decorated. The breakfast room and presentation there was also very classy and well done. Mind you, this place is not cheap, but then nothing is in Venice, but at least you are getting what you pay for. It's also a bit off the beaten path which makes it a little hard to find at first, but then sort of makes for a nice distance away from the high traffic tourist areas, while still being close enough to get there reasonably quickly. It is near the Academia Bridge vaporetto stop, so it's not to far away even when lugging a suitcase or two. The staff were also very friendly and glad to help us out with directions, restaurant recommendations (but don't think about going out late as everything is closed!) and such.

I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t begin to tell you how refreshing it was to have avoided the larger chain hotels and to have had the pleasure of meeting the staff and owner of this beautiful and elegant hotel. Everyone was warm, friendly, extremely helpful and so down-to-earth that you felt as if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been a regular at the hotel your whole life. We arrived by water taxi and we were left at a small pier just steps from the hotel. Although there had only been one room available when we had booked our reservation - upon checking in to the hotel we were surprised and pleased to learn that the hotel owner had very graciously upgraded us to a larger room. This type of thoughtfulness continued throughout our visit. Our room was cozy, elegant and every detail was thought of. Breakfast in the family-sized dining room was a great opportunity to meet more of the staff and other guests. It is this lovely hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff and management who make Charming House truly deserve its name.
