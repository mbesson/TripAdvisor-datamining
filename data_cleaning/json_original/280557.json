The hotel was easy to find; clearly signposted, and the map was very detailed in how to get there. Upon arrival, I was suddenly surprised that he asked for ID, not something I have ever had in my 7 years of Business travel in the UK, but since I had no passport with me, he accepted a card with my name on it. I was then surprised to be told I had to pay \u00a35 cash deposit for the room key. Again, no prior warning of this. Forewarning would have been better. Following checkin, I noticed I had been upgraded to a Twin room for 1, and the extra space was nice. Despite being simply decorated: no headboards on the bed, no desk (take note if your not comfortable to work from a bed top), the room was very clean and well presented (Though a bit tight space between bed end and wardrobe). Despite being street side, the noise was very low, and the bathroom, though small and simple was clean with no major defects I tell a lie; one small 'defect' of the bathroom. It was probably designed by a female. The toilet seat wouldn't stay up on its own. Bit of a nuisance for a male. Breakfast on the other hand was a bit meager and struggling for choice. A few suggestions would be to consider Yogurts, better selection of fruit, and a wider choice of cereals (not all of us like cornflakes or branflakes). I only settled for a glass of Orange, and they spared me the charge for that. One minor issue was when I asked to leave my bag was to discover that it was stored right next to the front door, in the foyer. No locks, not even a closed door. I was willing to pay the \u00a31 for the day, but not if its just left randomly out in the Foyer where anyone can just lift it and be gone. Cameras are all well and good, but Cameras do not guarantee I'll get it back if it was stolen. All in all, a suitable stay for a 1-nighter, though maybe room for improvement on the Breakfast front and better storage option for bags.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pesaro, Italy", "Title": "\u201c3 nights at 1 Lexham Gardens Hotel\u201d", "Author": "AntonioliFrancesco", "ReviewID": "UR125805623", "Content": "We stayed 3 nights in this hotel and we have got a good impression.

'Management' policies was responsible for this. After returning from dinner, after I had already checked in, the hotel refused to let me back into my room until I gave my credit card. This was due to payment transfer issues from Agoda to Lexham Hotel. I had previously paid in full to Agoda and had my confirmation voucher for this. This issue should have been settled between the hotel and Agoda - I (the customer) should not have been inconvenienced by this. The following morning I was given back my credit card, however upon checkout, management changed their mind again and 'Adam' the assistant manager would not let me leave the hotel and demanded I payed the hotel in full for my nights stay again. Again I refused as I had already paid in full, I was held for 45 mins. It was very stressful as I had a flight to catch, however when I explained this 'Adam' was very dismissive and told the receptionist 'do not let her leave' but then left me there for 45 mins while I stressed about missing my flight and pleaded with the receptionist to let me leave. When the receptionist finally let me go I was on the verge of tears, I was scared Adam would come running after me, I had to pay for a taxi to the airport to catch my flight instead of taking the tube which meant that I incurred a cost higher than what I paid for the hotel. A customer should never be treated this way, this was a banking glitch between the hotel and Agoda.

The first night, we checked into the hotel and we were given a room with no hot water. Nothing was done about this and we were told to wait until the morning at 8.30am for this to be resolved. At 9am the follwoing morning it had not been resolved and I had to continuously call uuntil someone came. We eventually were told that the particular floor we had been put on was being renovated and that we should never have been put there. We were then asked to move but when we asked for help moving the bags, we were met with rudeness and abruptness from the reception and the rest of the staff. We did not complain and got on with our move. When we got into the room, there was blood on the radiator, dust and cobwebs everywhere, dirt on the blinds, cockroaches and just general dirt. We still did not complain, as we accepted that we had made a terrible mistake booking the room and that we would just never stay anywhere but a chain again. However, on our last day we were rudely told to get out of our room after being 10 minutes late for check out, no one offered to help with bags etc. We then became very frustrated with the staff and the manager and proceeded to complain. The receptionist and the manager were so rude to us and basically told us to leave. I spent 585 pounds for 4 nights stay and we were met with the most rude, unhelpful staff and manager and the most filthy hotel room. I am surprised a hotel like this can exist in somewhere like Kensington or even London, especially for the prices they charge. I have since realised that many people have complained about this hotel on trip advisor, however, nothing has been done about it and the hotel is obviously really not bothered about their guests experiences, as long as they are receiving their money. Please can you do something about this, at least to protect any future guests. I am a well travelled person who has stayed in a range of hotels and hostels in a range of countries and this hotel, 1 Lexham Gardens is quite honestly the worst experience I have ever had.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Espoo, Finland", "Title": "\u201cOK value for money\u201d", "Author": "am02210", "ReviewID": "UR113593775", "Content": "The hotel is extremely basic - no lampshade on a bulb from a ceiling, no hooks in the bathrooms and minimum decor in the rooms.One of the paintings on the wall was placed behind the TV.

The list of problems for our overnight stay were as followed: * The heating in our room was left on the entire time and felt like a sauna, meaning we needed to keep the window open all night. * The nightlight behind our bed did not work. * The shower hook was broken and would not stand. * The shower water intermittently went very hot/very cold and hardly run. * The walls had torn off plaster and had been painted in sparse areas to cover god knows what. * There were some bizaree neon style lighting which stayed on all night outside our windows, meaning it felt like sleeping during the daytime. *There was no hairdryer. *The complimentary soaps had a best before date of Oct 2009. Not an issue as such but shows such a laziness and disregard for the paying customers. The reception staff seemed very unhelpful and slightly insulting. I do not expect to be leaned over for or waited on hand and foot, but a general level of respect should be maintained in any walk of life. I told the guy at reception about the shower and he didn't even act like it mattered. I guess there philosophy The only real good point were that the bed was very comfortable, if not somewhat too small, and that the breakfast was very nice and that the breakfast staff were the only friendly and courteous people who worked there. On the outside it looks nice, on the inside it really really isn't. The people who run this place are the hotel equivalent of used car salesmen. Once they have your money they really dont care about the goods you get.

The hotel is staffed by ladies who look extremely bored and are not-overly friendly but they are not overtly hostile either. They are OK. Most of the money has been spendt on the lobby and lounge area. The corridors are a bit stuffy/smelly, and the lift had graffitti in it. My room was roughly 9 feet by six feet, and the windows faced a brick wall. Pigeons gathered outside my window and crapped on the open pane, I was worried they would get in. Bathroom was clean and smart but the shower head's bracket was loose and I had to hold the shower head to stop it flopping over. There was no tea and coffee facilities in room and there was no lampshade on the single bulb in the ceiling. There were no bedside or overhead lights. The wardrobe was a weird affair: a big brown smelly thing which sort of fused with the wall and ran into the window. However, there was quite a nice plasma screen TV on a bracket at the foot of the bed. So that's where they have spent the money. The walls also had some unpleasant-looking marks (blood?) on them. Breakfast was a problem. As a single traveller I had nowhere to sit (not enough tables), so I had to stand at the back of the room like a creep (I wanted a table) until one of the staff noticed me and asked a table if I could join them. Fortunately they agreed. Thanks, Italian couple! Breakfast consists of cereals, toast, cheese and fruit (and sweet pastry) there were no cold meats (which are actually an important part of a real continental breakfast), and there was no yoghurt. When I left there was an annoying problem. They ask for a \u00c2\u00a35 deposit for a card key and after returning my key I was 15 minutes down the road before realising the reception woman hadn't given me my \u00c2\u00a35 back. So i had to trudge back to tell her, she didn't seem to recognise me (even though I had been there 15 mins ago!) and looked in her register to see I had not signed for my deposit. So she gave it back, but without much apology. Overall the place is not terrible, but I wouldn't stay for more than one night. I would find the ambience of the place to be slowly soul-destroying.

I booked a single but got one of the (recently refurbished) doubles.

You get a wardrobe and a small table with tea/coffee facilities, but in the room I had there wasn't enough room for a bedside table, so if there'd been two of us, the one nearest the wall would have been climbing over the other to get out! But hey, that's London for you! I also personally found the noise from the traffic a little intrusive at night, but then I'm used to living in the countryside... My only real gripe was that when I booked (via travelstay.com), the info indicated there'd be a desk which I would have liked to do some work in the evenings. Check-in and out (note: payment by cash only) were efficient and hassle-free and I found the continental breakfast a good start to the day (cereal, fruit, crossiants, pastries, cold meats/cheese, toast, tea and (instant) coffee). Location is good too - safe and just a few minutes walk to either Earls Court or Gloucester Road tube stations, with plenty of decent eateries around (I especially recommend Ask in the Gloucester Road tube direction). Although they don't allow food in the rooms, you can bring stuff in from the nearby Waitrose or Sainsbury's and eat in the dining room if you want to go for a cheaper option in the evenings. There's also free (and fast) WiFi in the reception area if you need it.

Yes the hotel is being remodelled, but detrimentally we suspect. Our brand new en-suite bathroom ( no bath, but shower, toilet and handbasin) had no toilet roll holder and no towel rails.

We suspect other rooms on those floors will be reduced in size to increase capacity, to the detriment of the hotel -stay experience.

The receptionist eventually agreed to let us have the extra night at the same rate as the rest of our stay. The 78 pounds quote was surprising in view of the fact that they would not have to pay booking agency commission. Parking outside is by meters, starting at 8.30 am until 7.00 pm and expensive.
