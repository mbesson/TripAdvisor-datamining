They are there to provide a service and not to be your friends. We booked 2 rooms with one 16 month old kid. The room is clean, tidy and comfortable. Do not expect room service because it is not a full service hotel. The rooms are air-conditioned, has a fridge for your own drinks and a safe for your valuables. Clean towels are provided once during the entire stay. The rooms are cleaned daily by a cleaner. It is situated next to Stazione Termini Roma. Getting there to any point in Rome is extremely convenient. Breakfast is served in a cafe down the street. One piece of pastry with coffee or juice. Any other side orders you pay.

I would start with the positive note (which is only one!) The room was clean. That\u2019s it. Now the negatives. The location is great, near the Termini but the neighborhood felt a little dangerous, especially at night. There were homeless people passed out everywhere around the area. The hotel is on a 4th floor of a building which houses several hotels. Owner is an old lady and her daughter is the manager, the problem is they don\u2019t speak any English and when we tried to communicate, it was like pulling teeth, they would shout at you.. Very grumpy! The breakfast was a voucher at a near place bar for a cappuccino and a dry pastry! Nothing special. When you checked in they would give you a set of keys, one for the main door downstairs, one for the interior door and one for your room, however if you came back late, they added a third gate which you did had keys for, so we hand to end up calling the owner and waking them so they could let us in.. not fun.. When we checked out, I was going to pay with my credit card (as stated in the booking.com website) and they tried to play the game of the credit card machine not working and stuff, when I told them I did not have cash, magically the credit card machine started to work. Also something in the bathroom pipes, which made the room smell like a death wish!

Carmella and her two daughters run this hotel and there is nothing they wont do for you. Sure, Carmella doesnt speak much english, nor do I speak much Italian, but the 8 nights there were nothing but great. The location if perfect for the main rail station and metro's. The rooms are clean and comfy (beds are european hard, but if you need a softer pillow, just ask). Yes, the elevator is small, but heck, at least there is one and my friend June and I laughed about it. Upon arrival you may have to go up one person and one suitcase at a time, but it is quick. Only a couple times did the people going to the 4th floor forget to close the red doors, so the elevator works...there is a huge sign in english and italian on the door, dumb people. But even if you have to walk up to the 3rd floor it is do-able. They give you 3 keys...one to the outside door on the street, one to the inside door before reception and one to your room. Heck, if you dont feel safe with this arrangement you are crazy. There are fabulous little places to eat all around and we made friends and were remembered each time we walked by them. The breakfast at Cafe Amici, is good and they are super nice there also (always remembered our daily drink and croissant). The price was remarkable for Rome, $75 a night for two beds with private clean bath, with bidet, toilet, shower and heated towel racks. What else could you ask for??? Not much!!!!

The room itself we found to be fine, not the lap of luxury but then that's not what we expected. the only other thing we had a problem with was when we came back a bit late (around 11:30pm) and the outer door to the hotel part was locked. when we were given our keys we were told we'd have to unlock the inner glass door, which we had a key for, but someone had shut the huge wooden one - meaning we had to get the older owner lady out of bed to come and let us in. we weren't informed of any curfew if there was one. all in all - it wasn't a disaster but i wouldn't go there again.", "Date": "January 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cTotally awful\u201d", "Author": "mcngdr", "ReviewID": "UR6165364", "Content": "The WORST hotel we ever stayed!

Termini area has so many people coming from all over the place, and so packed, so again, beware of pickpockets! Local shop owners said, get out of there, don't walk at night...bla bla bla. So, we were so bothered by this and we decided to move to another hotel the next day. The next morning, the lady who owns the hotel was so mad at us that she refused to charge only the night we stayed...she wanted to charge us for 3 nights! We were arguing with her and she was extremely rude. She yelled at us, threw our reservation paper right in front of our face while raising her voice and her hands. It was the most terrible and rude thing we ever experienced. So, we ended up paying for 2 nights, although we only stayed for 1 night. Another thing, although the room is nice, the bathroom is outside the room, and it smelled so bad. The shower has rust all over it, the bathroom floor was very slimy.

You had to track someone down and get a handwritten slip and then walk about three blocks to a diner where you received one croissant and a small coffee. If you wanted anything above that, you had to pay more. We were also informed that we had to pay our final bill in cash--they didn't accept credit cards, very different from what the website states.
