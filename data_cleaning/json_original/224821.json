I am glad I decided to see for myself. Evidently some folks can never be made happy! The rooms were clean and well taken care of. The staff was courteous and helpful. True,only coffee and no continental breakfast but the $47 room rate mare than made up for it. The key to good prices is book ahead. There is a resturant/bar accross the street that is really good and you don't have to drive. Unfortunately this location will be torn down in early 2009 to make way for the expressway interchange but the motel has not been allowed to \"run down\" in antipitation of this. I wolud definately stay there again.", "Date": "September 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin", "Title": "\u201cSimple place close to race track, too expensive\u201d", "Author": "vvddss", "ReviewID": "UR20364179", "Content": "This Red Roof is pretty close to the race track, but not really nice and too expensive.

On arrival I was extremely disappointed as the grounds were not at all well kept and I didn't feel it was the safest area to stay at. When I walked in the room there was a strong musty odor and the heat was stuck on so I had to turn the air on (which was extremely loud) to cool off the room. The room may appear clean on the surface but the carpet was questionable and the bathroom wasn't very clean either. I'm not accustomed to cheap rinky dink hotels so this was a nightmare for me. The only reason I even stayed the first night was because we got in at 12:30 am and had to be up by 6 am. I hardly slept due to a very uncomfortable bed and the fact that I was concerned about the cleanliness of the linens. Needless to say I didn't feel comfortable taking a shower there so we pack up bright and early, canceled our next night's stay and didn't look back. We stayed at a Holiday Inn the following night that was such a huge difference in cleanliness and comfort. Red Roof did send me a survey which I filled out honestly. To their credit they did apologize and offer me a free night's stay but I don't plan on ever staying at a Red Roof again, free or not. If you care about comfort, cleanliness and basic hotel necessities don't stay here!", "Date": "February 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGood Value for the Price\u201d", "Author": "NancyWorldTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR7246937", "Content": "This hotel is very conveniently located to the airport and the freeway.
