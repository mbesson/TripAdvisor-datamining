The breakfast buffet was very nice, and we appreciated the touch of espresso coffees. The hotel is close to the high end shopping street and spanish steps, which has a great busty feel in the evenings. The hotel itself was very quiet and we slept well. Plenty of nice cafes and restaurants nearby. Close for walks along the banks of the river. 20min walk from the Vatican. Tip, buy your tickets online for attractions and go in the morning- the crowds seem to come out lunch time to evening. Close to the Borghese gardens, which in addition to the Vatican, was our favourite place in Rome. This was the only place I felt like I truly got to see how Romans live, picnicking and riding bikes with their families on the weekend. The best thing about this hotel was the price.

Buy a three day ticket (the machines are easy to use) and you have great access to the Vatican area a couple of stops away and, changing at Termini, to the Colosseum. The stations are clean and well signposted. We didn't bother with the busses although the three day ticket covers them too. Breakfast is surprising: lots of variety but the food is dotted around the room! The coffee is great, but I agree with other reviewers that the ersatz orange juice is a bit of a let down. The rooms are inevitably small given the age of the building, but the building is well maintained and kitted out. The showers are a tad small so if you are well upholstered a different hotel might be wise. The street noise at the front is evident but truly Italian. Our air con didn't work ( moved air but didn't alter the temperature) and the front of house staff didn't seem fussed. This wasn't an issue in November but could be a stressor in summer. The staff were friendly and helpful. The lift (elevator if you're from across the pond) is classic old Europe: small with spy movie sliding grille doors. On closer inspection it seems well looked after. Beware the occasional idiot that leaves it on the top floor with the doors open so it can't be called to the ground floor. This is a characterful, memorable small hotel in a great location for tourists. It is in a very safe area.

The room was really nice and much larger than what we were expecting. The bathroom had a full tub with a glass door which only extended half way (so the other half of the tub had no door at all). This made for very messy showers and water went absolutely everywhere. The bathroom also had a toilet whose seat was not the same size as the toilet itself, and a bidet. The main room was nice with high ceilings. The room was also all digital (lights would stay on when you put your room key card into a slot and press the light button). We liked it a lot, though it took us a little while to figure it out. The hotel provided free internet which worked pretty well. The only thing is that we had to specifically ask for the internet username & password - they weren't provided to us automatically.

From there, we walked everywhere including to the Colosseum and The Vatican, but it's also close to a metro station. Secondly, the staff were extremely welcoming and friendly, with good English. Thirdly, a good continental style breakfast with plenty of rolls and croissants, fruit, cereals etc. They serve till 10am so you can have a nice lie in and still get your breakfast! Fourthly, the rooms whilst on the snug side, were inpeccably clean with plenty of wardrobe space, and extremely comfy beds with good quality sheets and pillow cases, plus very effective air conditioning ( which you seem to have to pay extra for in other \"budget\" Rome hotels).

Ladies and Gentlemen when reading reviews please notice the city/country of the other reviewers. It really helps to know the culture and preferences of the European travelers versus American travelers. I can tell you that size and amenities of the hotels do mean much more to Americans than to the Europeans. With this preambule let me begin. Our trip to Italy started on May 18, 2009 when we landed in Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport in Rome. Since I have been in charge of booking hotels for us and have used \"en venere.com\" for all reservations I have managed to book the limo from the airport to the hotel. I'm far from novice in international travel and the cost of the limo was the same as the cost of the regular taxi. Since I hadn't been in Italy in 20 years and I was seeng Rome from completely different perspective. Yes, Rome itself is Eternal and it will take take more than mere 20 years to change anything (except the prices). To make long story short we arrived at Hotel Centrale. Don't try to find it on Google Street View since via Laurina is so narrow that Google van probably couldn't make it through the street. The hotel from outside looked just like another store front. We were greated very warmly by the front desk clerk who told us that our room was ready and we could go upstairs. Here came the culture shock!!! I have forgotten how small the staircases were in Italy an since this building was converted from a regular appartment building it had the same convenient staircase that was considered to be adeqate in Roman times but a little to narrow and steep for a modern man. Alas, thank all the Roman Gods they managed to build an elevator inside the staicase shaft. The elevator, when I managed to fit myself and one of our medium size suitcases and manually close both the outside door and the interior (WOODEN) doors, took me to th 3rd floor where our room was located. From the hallway the door to the rom looked wide and substantial, and that was the only normal size feature in the otherwise most tiny and crammed up room I have ever set my foot in. If you can imagine the room that requires you to wait for your partner to sit on the bed so you can safely pass to the other side of the room without knocking down the chair you will get an idea. Now for the best of the best!!!! The bathroom!!! When I have opened the white bi-fold door to try and stow suitcase in the closet I discovered that I am looking at the bathroom sink and seeing my own reflection in the vanity mirror. You can imagine my reflection and especially amazement when I have strarted to take it all in. Imagine wall closet running alongside the whole length of the room. Now try to fit the toilet bowl, the bidet, the bathroom sink and the shower stall into a space 10 feet long by 3 feet wide and you will understand my reflection. Yes indeed the for the whole lenth of stay the size of the bathroom was the source of our private jokes. In order for one of us to get to the sink the door had to be open otherwise you were unable to fit in the space in front of it. All in all, I think it's the cultural shock that did it for us. We and I mean us - Americans are spoled by the amenities and comforts of our hotel chains and fortunately for us we can stay in hotels designed for our tastes and needs.", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat location - decent hotel\u201d", "Author": "DrJohnDublin", "ReviewID": "UR31949617", "Content": "Perfectly located near the Piazza del Popolo, this hotel is located in the quiet Via Laurina that links Via del Corso to Via Babuino.

There is a pizza bar across the street for an inexpensive slice and beverage if you are too tired to walk further afield. When booking my 3-Night stay in May I had asked for top floor to have views and daylight, but did not get that. It was easy for me to hop up and down the stairs just one flight to my room, but I was given one of the smallest rooms in hotel. The bed dominated the space and there was nowhere to sit, so I sat down in the lobby during rainy weather when I wanted to read materials. There is a nice filtered water machine in the breakfast room where you can fill up your water bottle, so that was a big plus for me after long, hot walks in the city.

This was our third trip to Rome and by far, the BEST hotel in Rome that we have ever stayed at, given the price. What can I say but \"location, location, location.\" This great little hotel, which provides the best in personalized service, is situated in one of the best areas in Rome. The hotel, which is on the Via Laurina, is sandwiched between the Piazza del Popolo and the Spanish Steps. The Centrale is also within walking distance & close proximity to many of Rome's finest attractions including the Piazza del Popolo, the Borghese Gardens, the Villa Borghese, the Trevi Fountain, the Via Veneto, the Via del Corso and many other Rome attractions. Additionally, as mentioned above, the Centrale is less than a 5 minute walk to the Metro stop located at the Spanish Steps. The hotel is small and personal, appearing as little more than a double-door glass entrance off a very narrow side street between the Via del Corso and the Via del Baubuino in the north end of the historic city center. Our check in went smooth and easy, as we were allowed to enter our room several hours early upon returning to Rome after a long journey. Our room was a HUGE surprise, as it appeared to be a small Roman studio! Our room was quite large by any standard with space for a queen size bed, a small table with 2 chairs, a setee that converted into a twin bed, several side tables, a few decorative tables, an armoire and even a fireplace! Our room was on the 5th floor, which could only be reached after taking the little lift to the 3rd floor and walking up two flights of stairs. Our unit had its own private patio, which had a great view of Rome facing east. My husband and I couldn't believe how warm and cozy our room was upon entering. The bathroom in our room was HUGE by Roman standards and included several toiletries and added ammenities. The bath tub included whirlpool jets and was appointed with a hand held shower attachment that worked very well. One touch I really liked was that the bathroom had a HUGE window that opened to the outside, allowing lots of fresh air to move in...it was great! The staff was beyond the best! From Franco (the day clerk) to Jean Francois, the evening clerk...to the housekeepers and porters...everyone was friendly, accomodating, helfpul and friendly. One couldn't ask for more, in my opinion! Despite our brief stay, the staff gladly made transportation arrangements for us (for the airport in the morning), gave us several suggestions for dinner reservations, offered to make us early morning coffee and chatted for long periods with my husband and I, tolerating my horrible use of the Italian language! While my husband and I needed to leave the next day way before breakfast was served, the staff offered to make us a fresh pot of coffee before we left for the airport...I couldn't believe how sweet & kind that was! Finally, I just loved the location of the Centrale Hotel. While the area is a bit pricey, my husband and I ate dinner at a great little Trattoria on the Via del Corso with our meal costing around $40 Euro. After dinner, we strolled to all the main sites in Rome and settled down at the Spanish Steps with gelato, just as all the local Romans do after their busy days. Without a doubt, my husband and I will definitely stay at the Centrale Hotel when we return to Rome in the future.", "Date": "October 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cNot Bad\u201d", "Author": "RichNY62", "ReviewID": "UR20228910", "Content": "I'll break this review down into two parts. First, the \"Good\": Cleanliness - The room was very clean, particularly and most importantly, the bathroom. Staff - As noted in other reviews, the staff was very friendly and personable. Upon our arrival a few hours early, Eric was very professional in trying to accommodate a twin room request and have it ready within a half hour instead of several hours. One of the overnight desk clerks wasn't overly friendly but that was made up for by all other hotel staff including the breakfast matron who was always greeting guests with a smile. Hotel decor - The Centrale's common areas are well appointed from the small yet classy lobby to the tasteful colors of the breakfast room to the nicely painted halls and stairwells. Again, all was spotlessly clean. Location - The Centrale is in a great location for sight access, either by foot or subway. The Spanish Steps are a brisk 5 minute walk. If you are into walking, you can walk all over the city center from here. A few blocks north of the hotel is Piazza di Popolo, a beautiful square with one of the city's largest obelisks and nice fountain. There are a number of ristorantes and trattorias in the area , maybe not as abundant as in other parts of the city, but still adequate choices. There are two subway station options, each about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The \"So-So\": Room size - The room was small. True, from experience, I realize that rooms in Europe are usually small, but our room was one of the smallest two-person rooms in the hotel (based upon a review of the emergency floorplan) and it had the smallest bathroom. There was about two feet of space on the side and the front of the bed. The wall facing the bed housed the neighboring room's bathroom, so every time the toilet flushed the sound was quite loud. The hotel is a year old, but the room couId have used a quick coat of paint to cover scuffs obviously caused by people navigating within the small space. If you book here, be sure to request one of the larger rooms and you should be OK. Room lighting system - The room uses a control panel for the lights that requires insertion of the room key. OK, I'm fine with that, but the illumination settings had a mind of their own. Breakfast - I don't expect eggs and bacon at European hotels (I don't eat them anyway) but I didn't expect chocolate cake (!)served either. An overabundance of sweet pastries made breakfast an odd experience. They did have some cereals and yogurt however, which I usually eat for breakfast, but nice crusty rolls which only came out one day, would be nice every day. Maybe add some hard boiled eggs and croissants and the breakfast issue is fixed. Automated wake up call system - This did not work. A request to the desk clerk seemed to be a good alternative, but the next morning he did not call either. Oh well, bring an alarm clock. I would still recommend the Hotel Centrale as it is a nice little hotel with relatively reasonable rates, especially for the location. I did a lot of research online and was basically satisfied with my hotel choice. One note: if you plan on taking a taxi from/ to the airport, call ahead and use the car service the hotel provides. The taxi we took rom the airport was more expensive, and half of these guys are crooks. The car service was a better choice for the return and in a nice Mercedes.
