Way east of the ocean, this is not a sea-side resort by any means. The winding road that leads up to the hotel is magically lit up at night and evokes a feeling of fantasy. The property itself is wonderfully appointed with lare receiving rooms, grand open spaces, large stair cases and beautiful fabrics, finishes and decor. Check-in was a breeze and our room was ready for us when we arrived. The room itself is large and offers all of the expected ammenities of a resort of this caliber. However, I was surprised not to find a shoe horn when it came time to get dressed. Small oversight perhaps, but still surprising. The corner sofa is horrible in its look, feel and functionality. It looks like a left over from Prince Ali's yard sale when he moved palaces to love with Jasmine. Round, over-stuffed, gaudy... It did not fit in at all. The furnishing were all over-the-top gilt, gold, bronzed or ornate in some fashion. although the bed looked nice, it was intact way too soft and had two big dips on either see with a mound in the middle. I don't know how many 350 pound people must have slept in this bed, but it felt like a 10 year old bed rescued from the fat farm. Getting inand out of bed was like picking one's self out of a marshmallow. We did not eat at the restaurant as we were attending a wedding so we can only attest to the bar and catering food. Both were outstanding. Over all, the location is great for anyone really looking for a peaceful and quiet get away. The place is immaculate and the service first-rate.

We ate oatmeal for breakfast almost every morning on our way to golf. It was delicious. All of the food was great at the resort. Now to the important stuff. The golf course at the resort is a ton of fun. It is definitely a hidden gem. You get a forecaddy at the course, as well. It is perfectly maintained and it is carved through the hills and valleys surrounding the Grand Del Mar. The views from certain points were breathtaking.

There are so many reasons to recommend this hotel I thought the easiest way to sum up the hotel is to do a list of pro's and con's:- Pro's:- 1.) You can self park for free. 2.) It has a great and reasonably priced cafe - everything purchased was top notch - It also gives a cheaper alternative to breakfast if you don't want to eat lots. 3.) It's very family friendly. 4.) The Espresso Coffee machine in the room is by far the best coffee machine I've ever had in a hotel. 5.) There's no resort fee, as is charged in many other high class resorts. 6.) The staff are exceptionally friendly and professional. 7.) The rooms are very classy and immaculately clean. 8.) The beds are extremely comfortable. 9.) The pools are all heated and refreshments are served at the poolside. 10.) The grounds are large and are safe and excellent for family walks. 11.) There's lots to do for all the family - Horse Riding/Tennis/Swimming/Hikes/Special Events arranged by the hotel - in our case an egg hunt for the kids on Easter Sunday. 12.) Great Restaurant - We ate in Amaya and found it was excellent. 13.) Free Raspberry Lemonade (Tasted amazing!) / Peach Lemonade was served with biscuits in the lobby area from 3-5pm each day for free - a very nice touch! 14.) Free coffee was served by the concierge desk in the morning before 9am. 15.) Free Wifi. Con's:- 1.) It's expensive (But in my opinion worth it!). 2.) It's a drive away from Downtown San Diego. 3.) The activities are a bit on the pricey side. I would recommend the Grand Del Mar without hesitation as one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.

I traveled with my three children and we were made to feel very comfortable and welcome. We dressed casually and never felt out of place. Some specific details about the hotel that may help as you make your travel plans are: * Very kid friendly and loads of kids activities. My kids simply loved the explorers club. However, we stayed during spring break and the place was teeming with children. I get the sense that there may be significantly less kids during off-peak times * several complimentary daily activities. We did a guided canyon to waterfall hike and a fantastic zumba class * The resort is not in a walkable area, however there is complimentary transportation to the beach and within a 14 mile radius of the hotel In conclusion, This is an amazing resort.

In mid-December 2011, I went w/ a group from work for a holiday luncheon at Club M. While the waitress was serving the 1st round of drinks, she spilled a whole glass of white wine on my new Marni handbag (I had rec\u2019d it as a Xmas gift from my boyfriend the previous evening). The management was apologetic and offered to send it to the cleaners but since I had another holiday event that evening I told them I would take it to the cleaners myself. They were fine w/ that and agreed to cover any cleaning costs. I took the bag to Margaret\u2019s (the premier cleaner in SD) and spoke to their leather expert. They cleaned the bag but the damage was irreparable. I was told that if they dyed the bag (super soft, dark green lambskin) they would have to re-color the entire bag and it may not cover the stains and definitely would change the texture (not acceptable to me). GdM refused to compensate me for the bag saying that they couldn\u2019t be sure that it was authentic. The GdM offered me $350 for the bag and $106 for the cleaning costs that I had incurred. I reluctantly agreed and then the GdM immediately said that they would \u201chave to do more research\u201d. I ended up sending the bag to the Marni headquarters in New York and received a letter of authenticity from the national sales director. The bag\u2019s replacement value was just under $1K. I filed a small claims case against GdM for $650 for the purse (which I thought was equitable) + $106 for the cleaning costs + shipping to/from NYC. Our court date was a couple of weeks ago and while the case was being heard, the GdM\u2019s representative LIED under oath. I was awarded only $100 (which didn\u2019t even cover the cleaning costs!). Later that day, my supervisor called Tom Voss (Pres of GdM) because of the way I had been treated by GdM. Mr. Voss agreed to pay me an extra $106 but was, to paraphrase my boss, not a very nice guy to deal with.

Once the economy recovers and the reputation of the Grand builds, you will be priced out of this particular piece of paradise. And do eat at one of the two wonderful restauarnts. While the food at Addisons was, as espected, fautless, it was not our style. We prefer Amaya - a truely first class culinary experience that is without the minimalism that comes with many of today's absolutely top culinary establishments (which Addison's surely is amongst.) So, if you want an esthetic wonder, piece and tranquility, a multitude of resort and spa activities and services, impecable food, somewhat austentatious but always in good taste surroundings all coupled with the world class San Diego climate give yourself a treat and stay here for a few days.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cSuperb experience all around.\u201d", "Author": "bmarkhasin", "ReviewID": "UR126213031", "Content": "As a frequent global traveller, I have stayed in most of the premier hotel brands in multiple cities, but I must say that the Grand del Mar surpasses them all. Every aspect of this property is exceptional. We were immediately impressed by the level of personal service and recognition. When we drove up to the gates, the security guard inquired about our stay before directing up to the hotel. The valet knew our names from the note the security guard left under the wiper. The check-in attendant walked us to our room where our bags were already waiting with the bellhop who walked us through the room to introduce the ammenities and overall layout of the grounds. At the restaurant, the hostess inquired our names and actually remembered them throughout our stay. Wow... Our room was large, spacious and beautifully appointed with woods, granites and marble. Needless to say the room was spotless. There is a large flatscreen TV in the main room and a second small TV in the bathroom if you wanted to watch TV or listen to music in the bath. The closet was essentially a walk-in configuration. We had a third floor room with a balcony opening onto a court yard. The room was incredibly well insulated for noise. I'm sure we had neighbors, but I had no idea they were there, and we didnt pick up any outside noise through the heavy balcony doors. As a light sleeper, I can honestly say this was one of the best sleeps I ever had at a hotel. We were visiting over spring break, and the intent was to visit the several amusement / theme parks in the region. My son opted to skip Disneyland to chill-out at the hotel pool!! Now we have another reason to come back... The Grand del Mar is a golf resort. The grounds are immaculate and although we are not golfers, we were impressed with the course surrounding the hotel. Perhaps next time we visit, we will opt for lessons through their pro-shop. The hotel has 4 pools and two hot-tubs. One area is reserved for adults and cellphones are prohibited (discouraged), with a large pool, hot-tub and bar. The other area contains 3 pools including a shallow kids pool and a small hot-tub. This family area also has a full bar with meal service. The hotel offers a baby-sitting service while the adults go for a round of golf, and there is also a daily program for kids. For older kids / teens, there is of course golf, as well as tennis courts and an equestrian facility. Pony rides can apparently be arranged for small kids, while trail rides and even riding lessons are offered for older kids / teens. There is a spa which we didnt utilize on this trip. There are several restaurants on the grounds and a cafe / gift-shop. We dined at Amaya. Food quality and preparation was excellent. They have a vegetarian dinner menu and will make minor modifications to their dishes to suit guests tastes. The breakfast menu is more limited in terms of offering vegetarian or non-dairy options. Pool-side meal options were relatively extensive. As expected, the Grand is pricey, especially if you throw-in a bunch of activities and opt to dine on-site throughout your stay. But if you want to treat yourself to an experience, we recommend this property. We will be returning in the future, staying longer and trying out the activities we missed this trip.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "vancouver, BC", "Title": "\u201cNothing Short of Spectacular\u201d", "Author": "cliu", "ReviewID": "UR125992376", "Content": "Whenever we check in at the Grand, we take a deep breath because we know we are \"home.\" The resort grounds and rooms are utterly amazingly out of this world.

We love the idea that the hotel remembers our favorite room so every time we come down, they immediately put us in that room. We come to San Diego now just to stay at the Grand Del Mar! From the time we arrive and the time we depart, there isn't a minute that we don't feel pampered or treated like royalty. So many staff members recognize us and address us personally which is hard to find these days at many large impersonal hotels. But then, the Grand Del Mar doesn't fall under that category because it is in a truly 5 star category of its own. This 390 million resort is one of a kind -- over 30 types of different rocks and over 30 types of different wood. Once you have stayed here, I guarantee you that you will not want to leave.

I want to preface by saying that I have stayed in a number of other top notch resorts (Ojai Valley Inn and Spa, Ritz Carlton, JW Marriott, La Quinta Reosrt and Spa, etc.) and none can compare. I will try to break it down for you all... Hotel and Checkin- This is a unique resort in that it is nestled in a gated community. I have never stayed here before and did not know anyone that has (much less heard of it). Upon driving up and valeting (pricey $30 per night), i was impressed to see a beautifully ornate lobby. Check in was a breeze. I requested a connecting room with the other family and that was quickly arranged. The receptionists actually greeted each of my children and offered them a toy from their treasure chest (never seen that before). He then walked us to the bellman and proceeded to lead us to the elevator. Very nice touch. Rooms: The rooms were on the 2nd floor. Beautifully decorated (made me feel as if I was staying in a palace). The bathroom was large and contained the closet. The bathroom was so large that we were able to put the pack n' play in their for my baby to sleep in. Each room had an espresso machine, as well as complimentary bottled water. Grounds: Immaculate. Very Very clean. Everything was in place. The pool area was very nice and even had soft white sand around the lounge chairs. They incorporated the golf course nicely and there were amazing views every where you look. Food/bar: We tried the snack shop (same kitchen as Amaya) once and Amaya twice (Dinner and Breakfast). The food was amazing everytime. Amaya for dinner had a great selection of food. I was not disappointed with anything that I tasted. They also have a huge selection of wine and scotch (my favorite). The lobby bar was great and I had my first taste of Absinthe there. The best thing I had was the complimentary cookie (and bottle of milk) that was provided during the turn-down service. Absolutely wonderful Golf: The course was in beautiful condition (even though it was at its prime condition). IT is pretty pricey but worth a shot if you are a golf fan. They included a fore caddie (my first experience with one) which made the experience wonderful. The practice facility was top notch (ProV-1 practice balls). Food/drink can be brought to you at anytime during your round. The course is private and closed to the public, thus the rounds are pretty fast pace and never crowded. Awesome golf experience. Spa: My wife is a self-proclaimed spa connoisseur and proclaims this to be one of the greatest spas that she has ever been too. Well ahead of the highly rated Ojai Valley Inn and Spa and on par with the Montage (Laguna Hill). She couldn't stop talking about the facility and service. Service: I have saved the best for last. The service is top notch. First class all around. I was expecting a snooty/snobby resort, but I could never have been more wrong. From the bellman to the waitress to the golf person to the cleaning lady, everyone was extremely polite and pleasant. Upon driving up, I initially laughed at the idea that this resort was \"family friendly\". I thought my family would be stared at and treated rudely, however, I could never have been more wrong. They bent over backwards to cater to my kids and family. They brought over a crib (with baby supplies) immediately. They found out it was my son's birthday and made him feel special the entire stay. They sent up a birthday dessert to the room. They gave him a gelato coupon (as well as one for each member of the family). He felt special the whole stay. There were also so many perks at this resort. I have also never been to a resort that offered 2 hrs of baby sitting (in the explorer club) while you are at your spa treatment. The wives and kids took advantage of the free shuttle (Mercedes Sprinter) to the local mall. Lastly, during our dinner at Amaya, everyone we encountered treated my family as if we were royalty. It wasn't the obvious things that caught my eye, but it was the attention to small details that amazed me. For example, my son was curious about our champagne, so the waiter went and put some Sprite in a decanter and pour it into a champagne glass for them (how awesome is that!). I can't say enough about their service... Sorry for the long detail, but as you can see, I thoroughly enjoyed our visit.

When I saw it was ranked #2 in US resorts (I believe that was the category) I felt I needed to weigh in. While this resort is very nice, it wouldn't be my top pick in the whole country. The room is beautifully furnished, but not that big. I don't know that I'd want to stay there for longer than a few days before I'd feel like we were on top of each other. The bathroom was certainly the best part of the room -- spacious and well appointed. But the opening into the room made no sense to me. Our \"shutters\" closing this opening kept popping open and we had to have housekeeping come and fix them closed. As other reviewers have noted, some of the rooms have no usable balcony, which was unfortunately the case with our room. Why would you not have a space in some of the rooms where you could sit and enjoy the lovely scenic grounds? Yes, the service is outstanding and they truly want to help you however they can.

The main reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that we were consistently disappointed by the food. We had a few dinners and cocktail parties, and there were flaws with each meal. Perhaps I am being picky, but if it's a top resort the food should be great too. We had better meals in the town of Del Mar.

Great Service, Though\u201d", "Author": "drustrange", "ReviewID": "UR122743353", "Content": "I stay in San Diego / Carlsbad are a couple of times a year, and I've had some disappointing experiences in the hotels; my guess is that with the neve-rending supply of tourists the hotels have a steady stream of customers no matter how bad they are. Over the years this has led me up the food chain of hotels in the area, culminating this past Thanksgiving with a 5-day stay at the Grand Del Mar. Location: Far from the city proper and the beach. Think of it as a retreat. First impression upon driving up: I know someone's going to tell you it's chic, but the Grand Del Mar looks like the architectural love child of Hearst Castle and a Rapallo waterfront hotel. Car valet: I don't grok the \"cars impart status\" meme. I drive a Subaru Forester - very practical. After driving down I-5 from San Fran, my car looked like a dirty little troll next to all the Escalades, Mercedes, Audis, and BMWs in front of the Del Mar. Whatever. Front desk: Impeccable service at check-in. We asked for accommodations near the adult pool. Because I'd asked for a suite and one wasn't available, they gave us a room with an unusually large balcony. Thank you, front desk man. A+ Room: The room was extremely clean and about 1.5x the size of a typical hotel room, with fresh furnishings and upholstery. The bed was too soft for my taste but other people will probably like it. The bathroom was modern and spacious as well - lots of stone and glass and mirrors but didn't tip over into the Vegas Zone. Shampoos and lotions were of good quality. Overall, the room met expectations given the price. Room service: Completely awesome. Everything we ordered was always correct, on time, warm, well-prepared, and well-presented. Pool: I often choose hotels because I want to do lap swimming. The Del Mar's adult pool (they call it the Quiet Pool) was definitely usable for this purpose. It's longer than 25 meters, super clean, and non-crowded in November (I was often the only one in the pool). However, it's way too warm for exercise. Also, there was new age music playing *underwater* at one end of the pool, which was a little weird till I figured out that I wasn't experiencing auditory hallucinations. After my swim an attendant unobtrusively brought me a glass of ice water, which was a first for me and a very nice touch. He also brought a menu, and if the day had been warmer I'd have ordered lunch and some sort of fruity cocktail - the pool area just puts you in that sort of mood. Overall, I'd give the Quiet Pool and its surroundings an A for design and service, B- for lap swimming. Grounds: Cutesy, utterly non-creative landscape-design. Very well-manicured. Lots of courtyards, fountains, gazebos, tiny privet hedges, rose trees, citrus in amphorae, and other cliche'd frou-frou, but it's restful to the eye. There's a croquet lawn with a St. Francis statue, and we often saw people playing, which was anachronistically delightful. I very much enjoyed watching the Brits turning croquet into an extreme sport... don't ask. B- for the grounds because they was sort of fun to stroll through. Once. Addison restaurant: We had Thanksgiving dinner at Addison. The food was very good but no way was it worth $600 for two people. Service was good but a little slow - I'd give them a pass on this because it was Thanksgiving, but the restaurant was over half empty. I checked the prices on the wines we were offered on my phone: they were selling $18 bottles of wine for $80+. Not unusual, I guess, but I wouldn't eat here again. Amaya restaurant: We had brunch and lunch on Amaya's heated patio several times - everything was delicious and the service was great. They even brought a water bowl for our dog, and let him sit under the table while we ate. Top notch casual dining! A+! Golf course: Dunno. The grass was green and rolling and there were holes here and there for balls to roll in and dudes dressed all preppy and plaid-y driving little clown cars around. Some people like this sort of thing. Hiking and horseback riding: Ok, this is not a hiking destination but we were traveling with our dog, and he's large and needs exercise. So I took him out on the Del Mar's horseback riding trails. I appreciated the convenience of having a trail on-site. The horseback riding is for the kiddies: just a couple extremely agreeable horses, and some short trails 'round the golf course. Kids under 12 will like it fine. Hiking D-, dog-walking A, horses B+. Dog friendly: Their website says they're dog-friendly, and before booking my reservation I called to confirm - we were showing up on Thanksgiving day and I didn't want to have any problems. The agent assured me that our dog would be welcome. And sure enough, when we checked in, nobody raised an eyebrow when we walked in with our 80-lb Rottie mix. HOWEVER. In our room, the binder of hotel services said that they only welcome dogs under 25 lbs. Nobody questioned us or gave us a hard time in the 5 days we were there, but we were *aware* that he wasn't really supposed to be there. It cast a bit of a pall on our whole stay. One big demerit to the Del Mar for not stating this on their website or when I called. Overall, the hotel was expensive but served up the value. The food at Amaya and from room service was very good. The room was nice and the pool was usable for lap swimming. The place is a tad clubby / smug with itself, but after 5 days I felt relaxed and as if I had been well cared for, so I might return anyway. I still feel bad about the dog, though.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern US", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely a great property !!!

We stayed in the 1st floor rooms. They have a patio with seating area that opens to the adult pool. The hotel is only 3 floors. The 3rd floor is on the same level as the lobby. The rooms are big (although I don't agree that they are \"huge\"). We were happy with the 1st floor room. The staff is super-friendly and they go out of their way to please. In the mornings, there is complimentary coffee/tea by the concierge desk on the lobby level. We had breakfast in Amaya restaurant and pretty much dined in the lobby bar lounge most evenings. Prices are high but we knew this going in. We also dined once at the Club M restaurant. It overlooks the golf course. If you have a car (which I would be shocked if anybody used a taxi given prices and location), then it might be worth venturing out to the surrounding areas (La Jolla or Del Mar area --there is a restaurant called Flavor by the ocean and on a street with lots of cute shops/plaza stores). The spa is fabulous. If you any service performed, you get complimentary access to the spa pool/steam room/pool/etc for the day. The gym is next to the spa and it has good equipment.

The grounds are immense and perfectly landscaped. Even the golf course has waterfalls, a stream, and colorful flowers everywhere. I love the fact that you can \"self park\" your car FOR NO CHARGE! What a wonderful option for those of us who are quite capable of walking to our car, and do not like paying $20.00-$35.00(Four Seasons, Vail)a day to park our car. Every hotel should have this option available, and not just tell visitors they have no choice. Hurrah for the Grand del Mar on this matter. The lobby has various designs of marble flooring, classical furniture and wallhangings, and fresh flowers.The intercom system has nice Spanish music playing, even in the elevators! Right off of the lobby is a formal living area, library, and cocktail lounge. Stunning! Check-in went smoothly, and I \"held my breath\" that our room would be in a good location. When we walked in we were overwhelmed with the grandeur and opulence of the room. We have stayed in several Ritz Carlton's, some incredible hotels on 4 Hawaiian islands, as well as gorgeous properties in Mexico, and this one was the nicest by far. We lucked out for sure with a perfect location. Alot of grand hotels have fabulous grounds and commom areas, but the rooms are just regular- not this hotel! The bathroom had a large marble tub, large shower, closeted toilet, two sinks with a television in between the mirrors, a chandalier, and pass-through space that can be opened/closed as desired, opening the bath area to the bedroom. Marble, marble everywhere- \"Wow\"! The closet is substantial, has a safe, and bath robes. There was a mini-bar in the room hallway, but no microwave. The room was large, and the bed was extremely comfortable. My very favorite part was opening the sliding glass doors to find a large balcony\" looking out\" onto a huge courtyard, with a view of some plush homes on the hillside nearby. It was as if we were actually on the French Riviera. Our room was on the 3rd floor, and we couldn't have been happier. Instead of putting a tag on the doorknob for privacy or service needed, you punch a button that lights up in the hallway next to the door. Green light-room needs cleaning/ Red light-privacy please. Brillant idea! Because we had eaten a late lunch before checking in, we decided to order room service for a change. It was tasty, delivered promptly on a cart with a white tablecloth and flowers, and just nice to enjoy our room that night. This was the only good food we had from the hotel. The next morning, after getting espressos from the hotel coffee bar, we decided to \"take a tour\".The property is so large, that it took us about 2 hours just to walk around ! We kept saying \"Wow\" over and over. The golf course is right next door, and there are some privately owned Villa style homes adjacent to the main building. If any of you are planning a very special wedding, I'd highly recommend the Grand del Mar!They have a quaint European style chapel right on the property, and many rooms to choose for a reception, not to mention the outside covered areas with fireplaces and firepits.. You will be \"living like Royalty\" ! There is an olympic size \"adult's only\" pool, which is next to the hotel spa. Servers bring out chair cushions, towels, and drinks/snacks.The family pool was in another area, and the children seemed to be having a great time. We stayed at the adult pool, then took a walk on the path that goes around the property-peaceful, quiet, and as if we were in Tuscany. The only disappointing part of this visit was the food in the restaurants. We ate lunch at the golf club, sitting outside to enjoy the cool,\" sunshiny\" day. Our cocktails were fine, but the fish tacos were terrible, and I mean awful ! There were 4 small uncooked white shells, with a few morsels of grilled fish on each, topped by some tasteless white cabbage. No pico de gallo, no sour cream, no guacamole, no red cabbage or special sauce, It was bland and tasteless. We were very disappointed. That evening we ate at one of the hotel restaurants, and again were very disappointed in the food. It was nice sitting outside near a firepit, being able to gaze at the moon and stars, and smell the fresh air. However I could barely finish my dinner. To be honest, I don't even remember what I had, and my husband call tell you that I can verbally recite every superb meal I have ever had, even 20 years ago, in full detail. Both of us disappointed again. If we are in the area again we will definitely splurge (over $400.00 a night) for two nights and stay here again, but will go elsewhere for lunch and dinner. You may want to \"check out\" on the internet nearby places to eat that are good. The concierges were extremely friendly and efficient, but were hesitant to recommend nearby restaurants. Naturally the hotel wants visitors to stay there and eat at the hotel's restaurants.. Everything was expensive, and the food just wasn't worth the high price. We \"saved up\" a few years ago to stay at the Highlands Inn in Carmel, which was romantic and unique, and now we also have special memories of this\" splurge stay\" at the Grand del Mar.

Outside the US, Exclusive Resorts -Costa Rica still beats it, but I think that\u2019s because of the other amenities and amazing food we had in Costa Rica (see below). A few things to work on: 1.The Amaya restaurant is okay at best. A little too bland and the portions too big when they\u2019re trying so hard. I ate the crab cakes benedict and it was\u2026 meh. That said, the staff was amazing with our son. They were so incredibly nice to him. I felt that they instinctively knew where the power really was in the family! The kids menu was simple and wonderful, and therefore, actually better than the adult menu. I think that Amaya would do well to focus on excellent.simple.organic.food. I wouldn\u2019t care if the prices stayed the same. 2.The staff at Club M could be a little more courteous. They seemed to be disconnected with the other eating establishments on the grounds in terms of quality of service.

We also had fun eating appetizers and having wine in the lounge area. The only downside to the hotel is that it's not located near the beach. If you don't mind driving a little ways to get to the beach, then I would recommend staying here.

Because we book through American Express, we had a $65 breakfast credit each day, which we used to order room service. The food was very good. All of the service people are top-notch. Every single one was very courteous and \"went the extra mile\". The one thing I chuckled about was the fact that almost every employee uses the word \"Absolutely\" and \"Perfect\". They do make you feel special there. We were celebrating our anniversary and within an hour of our arrival, champagne and a fancy little dessert were delivered to our room. Laura, the girl that delivered it, remembered me from our visit last year. Besides room service, we dined at Amaya, which was also very delicious. We requested Brian for our server. He waited on us last year and he was really a delight. My husband likes to \"talk sports\" and Brian was up to the task. Brian remembered us and recalled that we were from Las Vegas and even recalled a health issue that my husband experienced last year. The lobster bisque and butter lettuce salad was excellent, as well as their pretzel bread. Two nights we had casual fare in the Lobby Bar. Kellie was our server and was very efficient. She moves around the bar like a whirling dervish. We had the margharita pizza, sliders and chicken quesadillas. They will permit you to order from the Amaya menu and will serve you in the bar, in case you don't feel like dressing up a little for Amaya. Although, I have to say, that a lot of people were dressed very casual at Amaya. We did purchase some snacks and coffee drinks at Cent Anni, their coffee shop. I had the best iced vanilla chai latte. I had never had one before and it was great. The only thing we were not impressed with was their Concierge personnel. They did not seem on par with the level of service that we received from everyone else. Also, they gave us some misinformation regarding valet parking at a downtown restaurant. We enjoyed walking around the grounds. There is a loop around the perimeter that is .7 miles. We walked that numerous times. Each of us had a treatment at the spa. My husband enjoyed a massage and I had an exfoliation/massage treatment. I wasn't that thrilled with mine, but that was because I have sensitive skin and should not have picked that particular treatment. Their spa is very elegant and relaxing.

The pool service was the only area that needed improvement as it did take quite a while to get a waitperson and she was not versed in the menu.

Served hot bread (rolls and breadsticks freshly baked) and fresh butter. His suggestion of the grilled garlic lime shrimp salad was wonderful. They use freshly ground angus beef (sirloin) and it came rare as desired and the bun was homemade. The dinner at Addison was also wonderful - the highlight being an incredible cheese gougere served as one of three amuse bouches. An explosion of cheese was like a mouth orgasm. Loved it. The lamb however - supposedly a 'signature dish' was oddly sweet and bland and lacked juice. Not recommended. The sweet pea ravioli was lovely - almost as good as Spago. All the vegetarian options were very creative and highly recommended. Excellent King Crab first course. The rooms were well designed, beds extremely comfortable - outfitted with Pratesi sheets. Great bathroom. There was an annoying green light above the bed (smoke alarm?) that was poorly positioned for people who like a dark environment. I would suggest that housekeeping provide eye masks on request. The feel of the place was like a wonderful Italian palace - lavish and opulent and yet warm and inviting.

I loved most things about this hotel and we plan to return to stay here again. Most of all I liked the friendly staff. When you travel with two children you can always tell if the staff is trained to be kind and helpful to children. This staff has had top training and are wonderful. The rooms are very nice despite the decor which is fake Italian (i.e. mirrors made to look worn and distressed and lights made to look like dripping candles). It is true that you have to walk down endless hallways to get to them but they are nice. I asked not to have any air fresheners placed in our room and they listened. We had a little porch with two chairs facing a golf course. My father had a porch (facing a pretty garden) that was too small for even one chair. A big plus would be an addition of screened doors for the porch because it would be nice to have the fresh air without getting mosquitos in the room. The family pool is not huge but is large enough when the hotel is not too busy. We had it almost to ourselves in April. The landscaping is attractive. The staff is helpful with towels, etc. The first time we used the pool the staff started to clean with a loud smelly machine and we left. I thought they might have waited until it was empty. Also, there was a bit of a mold problem around the pool drain areas that needed to be attended to. The Amaya restaurant is a great place for breakfast and we tried to go there every morning. We liked to sit on their outdoor terrace. The waiters give top notch service and are super friendly. My kids loved the pancakes and the adults liked the salmon bagels. All were happy with the fresh squeezed orange juice. Once the gardner came around just as we sat down and kept mowing the same patch of grass in front of the restaurant. After several of our requests to make him stop a staff person finally went over to ask him to leave. The hotel should arrange that gardeners come after breakfast and before lunch to work in that area. At night the hotel provides a variety of musical entertainers. We stayed up one night to listen to an older guy with a great voice play piano and sing standards. He even obliged us with a request for Billy Joel's \"Piano Man\" complete with harmonica. The hotel has several walks on it's property and the surrounding area. We were lead by one of the staff to the beginning of two trails that started past the horse stables. We walked on the one that turned right (the less traveled one) and soon noticed that there were ticks crawling all over every one of us! Disgusting. We felt that the hotel should warn the guests that they have a tick problem on these paths and told them so when we returned to shower and change. We took a stroll around the hotel property and were surprised when a dog came barking out of a ground floor room. The owners stopped it before it reached us. It made me think that I would not be very pleased to have a dog barking in a room near me. Not relaxing. The spa is good one. My daughter and I went for a massage at the same time. She liked hers (my only complaint with hers was that the lady had a cold) and I liked mine. For Easter the hotel made it fun for kids by having an egg hunt and other activities. Advice to fellow travelers: stay at this place if you want a relaxed and upscale hotel with great service. Advice for the hotel: Get rid of that awful scented candle that is in the lobby area. It smells very artificial. Also, please get rid of all the fake books and yard sale non-English books that are glued together in the \"library\" area.

Four Seasons in many locations, Ritz, Capella Pedregal in Cabo, Kea Lani in Maui, many locations in Italy, Trump and Penninsula in Chicago, Atlantis in Bahamas, the Fountain Blue in Miami and most of the high end resorts in Vegas, and the Grand Del Mar is our favorite by far. We were back for our second visit and brought our friends who are also very well travelled and they were completely blown away. The resort is independantly owned and the owner lives in a home on the grounds. You can tell he (Doug) has amazing pride. Every detail was thought through. The first time we stayed here was in terrace room at the adult pool and my husband and I had a wonderful stay. This time we were with our family (3 children-4, 6, and 8) and our friends who also have 2 children. We rented a villa and it was completely rock star. Totally worth the nightly rate and we will be back many times. I am already planning my 40th birthday party there for a destination party with friends. Tennis (most amazing tennis pavillion with great instructors-both Rick and Lynn are great! I have played with both of them and I have gone on tennis trips to saddle brook in tampa), amazing golf course, the kids love the explorers club (free to villa guests), great pools, fire pits all over the resort, and a brand new equestiran center with beautiful retired race horses. We did a group lesson with the kids and a trail ride-very beautiful and the kids loved it and it is steps away from the family pool. We had a meal cooked for us in the villa on the grill and Matt from Amaya was a pleasure to work with and his staff was friendly (jose was great!) and the chef prepared our steaks and sea bass to perfection. what a treat that night was!! The resort will provide a car for you within 15 miles-so you can get to del mar or la jolla for a nice dinner out. For those travelling with kids-legoland was only 20 minutes away and we didnt scratch the surface of all the san diego sites..... We worked with Amanda to plan our stay and activies and she was a complete delight. She was totally accomodating even though we kept changing our minds on daily schedules and activies. I can't say enough. If you can get there either as a couple (I did a spa day the first time I visited and it was amazing!!!) or as a family.....it is a hidden treasure. You will be completely blown away by the beauty of the grounds. If you can swing a villa, the most amazing vacation rental villa I have stepped into....I could go on and on, but totally perfect. My only feedback to management (if they read this) is when you build another phase of villas--PLEASE make them four bedrooms!!! 5000 square feet.....you should have accomodations for 2 families....3 bedrooms just is difficult. That said, it was our favorite spring break and we will be back again and again and again...and if you build a four bedroom villa, we will buy a fractrional share...promise.

We got engaged at this hotel 2 years ago and have since been back to the property but not to stay at the hotel. The overall experience at this resort is definitely 5 star. The service is amazing and the rooms are gorgeous. We stayed in a Grand view King Room which had a view of the golf course and a really good sized balcony. We had spa treatments on the Saturday and that was amazing. I had the body scrub with the Vichy shower and added on a scalp massage (just be aware that they add in the 20% gratuity). The spa is clean and luxurious and very enjoyable. While quite different in decor, this hotel reminds me of the Four Seasons, the staff are very friendly and remember you by name and the rooms are very clean. I would recommend a rain shower in the bathrooms, as the shower heads are a little weak. I would also suggest complimentary sunscreen at the pools (highly recommend the adult pool, huge and very quiet). We could not get into Addison's although we had tried to get reservations a week or so ahead. They said we were at the top of the \"waiting list\". They never did call us. We ended up having dinner at Amaya. Great food, did not like our table location, right next to the door and the waiter's station. I also did not care for their wine list, hard to follow. However, overall, I would definitely not hesitate to recommend this hotel, while it is far from the beach, you do have more sunshine inland than you would at the coast.

The Grand Del Mar was the best hotel of our trip by a clear country mile. The level of professionalism from the staff was truly amazing and I would return in a shot. The location is peaceful but only 20 minutes from downtown San Diego. The resort grounds are sprawling and gardens and pool areas are beautiful. Although it is clearly a modern hotel, the grounds are beginning to look well established and the pool areas are great. Different areas for couples and families so everyone can relax. The decor is over the top opulent which works really well in the public areas but is maybe a bit too much in the bedrooms but the rooms were spacious, quiet and exceptionally well equipped (great to have a Nespresso machine). What really sets this hotel apart is the service. Before arriving, we were contacted by a very helpful guest services manager who arranged a meal and taxi transportation for New Year's Eve over a week before we arrived. On arrival (it was our birthday), we received sparkling wine and a cake in the room. On New Year's Eve every guest was offered a complimentary bottle of wine from the in-room bar. You cannot imagine how surprised we were when my wife threw her deodorant in the bin before breakfast one morning, to find two new deodorants and a compliments card on the counter when we returned to the room. In short, they have an exceptionally well trained staff who really go out of their way to anticipate your needs. We were really pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and wine in the hotel. Amaya is no casual bistro and every meal we ate there was beautiful. We particularly appreciated the very well priced kids menu and the fact that we could enjoy fine dining with our children as a family. The restaurant staff were extremely professional and all remebered our names. This is despite the fact that this is a large resort. Attention to detail is superb. What I really appreciated was the fact that although this is not a cheap hotel, I never felt we were over-charged for anything. If you wanted a light breakfast, there was a take-away coffee shop and the prices for food and drinks were very reasonable, the quality superb. Both my sons spent an afternoon at the kids club where the staff actually made things with them and played games rather than leaving them to get on with it with the playstation. My only criticism was that the valets were not the most charming or professional. They were prompt, but didn't have the same attitude as the rest of the staff. So many hotels invest a fortune in the hardware and then mess it up with the service that it was a joy to stay in a hotel where the customer comes first.

I have traveled quite a bit and the service at this hotel was far beyond exceptional. I arrived a day early and was able to take the courtesy car within a 14 mile radius. The resort is right near Del Mar and La Jolla and I was able to visit the Birch Aquarium and relax in a beautiful spot on the beach. ROOMS - the rooms at the resort are enormous (see photos). I had a standard room that overlooked a nice courtyard. I found the bed to be very comfortable and the room, quiet. There were several plush pillows on the bed which were a mix of soft and slightly firmer, giving you a choice without having to call the conceirge. I slept very well throughout the week. The room had plenty of space for all of my belongings, so I was able to unpack everything when I arrived. I used my laptop throughout the week- the resort's wireless internet was very fast and easy to connect to. The patio was small, but comfortable and no matter where your room is in the resort, it offers a nice view. FOOD - Although I am a picky eater and have several food allergies, the food was superb and the staff was more than willing to customize any meal that I ordered. The menus offer many different options and one of the best things is that there is a cafe where you can order sandwiches, cookies, smoothies, coffee and gelato. This made it easy when I wanted to grab a quick bite and carry it anywhere on the resort to eat. MEETING FACILITIES - The meeting facilities were excellent and the staff went above and beyond to make sure that everything went as planned without any issues. They offered flexible options for meals, meeting space, A/V and other amenities that a group may be looking for. I saw some pictures from weddings that took place there and they were just gorgeous.

It is approximately a 20 minute drive from the San Diego airport and not too far from neighboring towns to visit such as La Jolla, Del Mar, Old Town, Encinitas, Solana Beach and downtown San Diego with the trendy Gas Lamp Quarter. The drive up to this gorgeous property makes you feel as though you are staying at someone\u2019s estate. The hotel is truly beautiful inside and out, and is immaculately kept. They have an exceptional staff, in which all provided excellent customer service throughout our stay. Concierge was of the utmost assistance. It is the little things that make a vacation special, enjoyable and memorable, and listed are just a few to mention...Loved the complimentary shuttle service provided! VIP all the way! The turndown service with the list of daily activities each day and weather, along with the yummy chocolate covered Oreos left next to your pillow each night and complimentary water at your bedside. The newspaper arriving on the door every morning. The beautiful rooms with such pretty views of the courtyard, the golf course or rolling mountains that surround the property! The beds are so comfortable and the bathrooms are nice and spacious with a large shower and soaking tub. Large closet and separate toilet area and loved to be able to watch the TV in the bathroom while showering or just brushing my teeth! The gym and spa looked very nice as well, although we did not use them during our stay. The hotel restaurants were wonderful. We had delicious breakfast and dinner at Amaya, which has indoor and outdoor seating. Addison was exclusive 5 star-dining with a highly knowledgeable and pleasant staff explaining every detail to each course, if requested (as we did :). Club M opened on the hotel property the week of our visit and it seemed to be a popular spot for the locals as well as hotel guests. I also have to mention the amazing Flamenco band- Javid & Naoko, that played in the stunning lobby one night. The pools were always spotless and are heated. There are fire pits outside to enjoy under a beautiful moonlit sky and also fireplaces inside throughout the lobby area to get cozy by. Gorgeous huge vibrant flower arrangements are in the lobby. I can just go on and on about all the things that stood out about this hotel, as you can tell I really loved this hotel and miss it terribly! My Aunt and I felt pampered, spoiled, and treated like queens at The Grand Del Mar and would highly recommend it to everyone.

This year after reading a number of reviews, and after correspondance with the Hotel we chose to stay here. Whilst a little more than we wanted to pay we made sacrifices elsewhere so that we could stay within our overall budget.(We were on a three week road trip). In summary: Pre-visit: We had excellent correspondance with Brianne and Josh in the Sales team ahead of our visit, with Brianne in particular helping to arrange restuarants, and Josh making a number of valuable recomendations. They continued to offer support and excellent service throughout our stay. Check in and arrival: After speaking with the hotel team we arrived at 12.30PM knowing that we could use the facilities whilst waiting for the room to be made ready. The valet, and Bell Boys did a great job and our first impression was extremely positive! The check in team were equally welcoming, and promised to get a \"rush on\" so that we could be in our room quickly. One we were told was almost ready. Great we thought, albeit the early check in did not arise, and I had to chase up the front office team. Jon the Front Office Manager got involved and recognised that there was a problem and made great efforts to get us into our room, and ensured that we recieved excellent service whilst waiting. This excellent service continued for the duration of the stay. Room: Many of the reviews on here \"wax lyrical\" about the rooms and we concur with all the positive comments. Hotel and facilities: The Swimming Pool, Spa, and Gym were first class, with the Service around the Pool the best we've come across. Jason and the team ensured a pleasant and restful time was add. Restuarants: With the exception of Addison we ate and drank at all of the Bars and Restaurants. We personally prefered breakfast at the Golf Club, Lunch by the pool, and Evening Meal at the Golf Club or in Amaya. We finished most nights in the wonderful bar area with a cocktail. At each location the Service was excellent and the Food Quality befitting of a Five Star Hotel! Golf: Whilst staying at the Hotel we played at Torrey Pines, and at the Grand Del Mar. The course here was in better shape, and a real test of Golf. All the staff associated with the Golf course were a credit to the Hotel. We particularly enjoyed using the practice facilties. General: What made an excellent stay into an unforgettable experience were the little extras. From the gifts in the room for special occasions to the courtesy car which we took advantage of. As mentioned by many what sets this hotel apart is the Service provided by the finest staff that i've come across on my travels. All of the Staff we encountered genuinely appeared to enjoy working here, and took great pride in the Service we offered.

We went into their website and after viewing the property immediately booked two nights. Upon arriving at the front gate of the complex we were checked by a security guard and given a valet parking ticket and allowed to enter. The driveway up to the complex and surrounding areas was stunning with the golf course around us. Driving up through the gates to the Hotel it was simply stunning, with the helicopter pad on one side and such lush gardens and surrounds. We were welcomed warmly in the driveway and our bags uppacked and taken to our rooms while we checked in and were offered wonderful home made lemonade. A wedding party was arriving as we checked it and the area was crowded but it didnt take away from gorgeous public rooms and flower arrangements. Check in was efficient and in fact at that time we had hardly seen any of the hotel other than the grounds and foyer but we immediately felt that we wanted to have our \"spare night\" at this property. We had booked a Grand King room, with breakfast each day (up to the value of $65usdollars) and this included valet parking and 20% off any retail products we purchased, it also came with an upgrade room. The hotel is gorgeous and we had an unbelivable room, with an enormeous bathroom, huge tub, double sink and plenty of vanity space, huge shower, separate toilet and walk in robe off the bathroom area. The hallway also had a wonderful timber wall unit with glass cabinets that held the glasses and mini bar products and also had a sink and water as well as the standard mini bar fridge, the good thing was it was not one of those automated ones, so we could store our own beverages in there, and as we still had champagne form our trip to the Napa Valley this came in handy. Also a bottle of champagne and a special desert was delivered to our room with a note from the manager wishing us a Happy 25th Wedding anniversay - very nice touch. The room was large and well appointed with a king bed, a separate make up dressing table, a large plasma tv another desk area and a lounge chair. Stepping out through glass patio doors we had a little patio area with chairs and table (although one chair was missing they soon found it). From there we went out a little gate and three steps later were at the Adults only pool. It was wonderful to have a pool for adults only as well as a spa as not everyone has children and in such a wonderful relaxing resorts its nice to have quiet time without other peoples children intruding on your quiet time. The family pool area was on the other side of the complex. The service from all the staff was exceptional and particulary around the pool area, where staff provided complimentary magazines, sun glasses, sun tan lotion, bottled water and frozen grapes. The restaurants are amazing. Amaya has wonderful fire places and great food try the lobster bisque and their other lobster signature dish, it was so good we had it two nights out of the three we were there. The other night we ate at their fine dining restuarant Addisons. The meal was wonderful and the service exceptional and also for a quality signature restaurant very reasonably priced compared to some of the other signature restaurants we have been in our trip. The hotel has a complimentary car service that takes guests anywhere they want with in 14 mile radious and we used this service to go into La Jolla, but they also took us a few mintues down the road to the restaurant in a lovely mercedes and then collected us after our meal. The hotel and its facilities were so wonderful that we didnt even get into San Diego we just enjoyed the resort so much and as we had been away almost eight weeks at this stage we deserved the well earned down time. If you dont have valet parking included in your room rate its a very reasonable $15.USD per day. This is one very special hotel and golf club and we will definately be back. We have decided never to stay in LA again but to hire a car and drive the two hours to Del Mar before we have to fly back to Australia.

We requested a crib and a high chair and early check in since check in was scheduled for 4pm and we were arriving around noon. I was pleased to see the email from guest services as it seemed to set a nice tone for our arrival. When we arrived (around 1:30pm), we were told our room wasn't ready. We were a little disappointed but didn't really mind waiting. When I asked how long it would be, she said she would request a \"rush\" on the room for us. I also noticed that our room rate was incorrect and showed them a print out of our confirmation with our room rate. They said they would have to check with a manager. An hour and 45 minutes later, I checked in with the front desk again to see if our room was ready and they said they were just finishing up. Another 45 minutes after that (at 4pm...normal check in time), our room was available. Since we had our 2 small children, a 2 and 1/2 hr wait and the \"rush\" that the front desk promised but we didn't seem to get, set a bad tone for the rest of the stay. I later received a call from the hotel stating that the manager would \"honor\" my confirmed rate which I found the the way they handled it funny because they acted as if they were doing us a favor even though I had print out of our confirmation clearly stating what our booked rate was. We stayed in a Prado suite and the room was great. They also had cute animal travel neck pillows as gifts for our children which was a nice touch. The pools were great and they would bring out complimentary treats (mini oreo shakes, frozen pineapple). The hotel had turndown service which included bottled water until we received a used bottle of water. We also had breakfast at Amaya (brioche french toast was probably the best we've ever had)...service was great until the server just forgot about us and forgot to bring us our bill.

There is a maritime haze around the coast in June - however, The Grand is situated in land, so luckily we were only affected by this on 2 days out of our 8 day stay. We were made incredibly welcome from the moment we arrived. We've stayed at some great hotels over the years, but I would say that this was the best. The hotel is a bit remote, and we didn't want to hire a car, so we were told that we could make use of the courtesy car service - which we did nearly every day. The service goes a maximum of 14 miles from the hotel, so we went to Del Mar, and La Jolia, and to Solana Beach train station, where we caught either the Amtrak or the Coaster to San Diego. We told the hotel the arrival time of our train, and the driver was at the station waiting for us. It is a fantastic service. We ate in the hotel restaurant every day for beakfast, and every evening, except for the evening when we ate at The Addison, which is the hotel's signature restaurant. The food was excellent, but not cheap, but the breakfasts are huge, so we found that we didn't want to eat until the evening. The staff could not do enough to make our stay enjoyable. Nothing was too much trouble. We emailed to say that we would like a coffee maker in the room, and were pleasantly surprised to find it there when we arrived. The adult only pool area is great.

We booked a different hotel for our last three nights in San Diego but wished we had just stayed at the Grand del Mar as it was a fantastic experience. We were stunned by the level of service at this hotel. Most of the staff could not do enough to help you and constantly offered us service above and beyond that required. We were very impressed by the room. It was extremely comfortable and quiet and exceptionally well cleaned. The bathtub and shower were both large and comfortable. More water pressure would be nice in the shower but I do understand the need to conserve water. The public areas of the hotel are very attractive as well. We played golf on the very nice golf course. Fortunately we were able to get the twilight rate as the regular rate is extremely expensive. The golf course was empty and I suspect that is because of the high prices. If you are willing to pay to golf bring your own clubs because the rentals are $85 for a round which is very steep. I spent two wonderful afternoons at the tranquility pool and enjoyed it very much. A chair cover and towels are laid out for you when you arrive and you will be offered a glass of ice water as well. Through out the day small drinks and frozen grapes are also offered. I had lunch out at the pool one afternoon and while good it was not worth $25 for a salad and a diet coke. There is a sign restricting access to adults only. For some reason a number of families ignored this and walked through but none stayed. There is also a sign stating no cell phones but most (to my disgust!) also chose to ignore this. It is not very tranquil to have a loud one-sided conversion going on beside you. The polite people got up and left the area when they got a call. I would love to see people leave the phones in their rooms and enjoy an afternoon not connected. I had breakfast at the resort three mornings and was shocked by the prices. The orange juice was the best I have ever had but at $6 it should be. One day my breakfast was $34 including a tip for an omlet, coffee and juice (yes that is the price for one person). The service is outstanding but this is too much for a meal. Breakfast at the golf course grill is a better deal and just as tasty with the added bonus of the view of the course. The resort is quite a distance from other restaurants or I would have left the resort for my meals because of the excessive prices. Overall it is a fantastic hotel with great service but the extras such as food and golf are too high even for a high end resort.

The staff were well trained, professional, truly outstanding. The hotel grounds were delightful. My children left saying that they couldn't wait to return. I am a critical traveller and cannot think of one complaint about this property. In fact, when we were checking out, I asked to speak to the manager to offer my compliments and also intended to send a glowing letter to the owner. I almost wish that I had not done this because during the conversation, I learned that the hotel is owned by Doug Manchester. He is a controversial businessperson who has made media headlines because of his financing of conservative social policy issues. Of course, everyone has a right to support what they wish. But had I know this beforehand, I probably would not have chosen to support this business, worrying that my money was being used, in part, to support causes I do not believe in. I was sort of heartbroken because this is a property I would have liked to return to, but probably will not because the owner is very public about his views, and making them so public sort of ties this to his business in a way that private behavior would not. Of course, TripAdvisor is not about politics and the hotel is fabulous. I share this only because I wish I had known this information before my booking (I had read about Doug Manchester, but didn't know this was one of his hotels). . .many might not care about such matters in selecting a hotel.

Set on a hillside overlooking a golf course, this Italian styled hotel is a treasure of a modern day hotel done beautifully to mimic an \u201cOld World\u201d European grand hotel. From the moment you enter the hotel, you will be impressed with the grandeur of the hotel and of the amazing architectural details used, that clearly show that no corners were cut when building this almost new hotel. All the standard rooms seem to be the same, just with different views. We had a Fairway view room that overlooked a garden courtyard with the fairway off in the distance. The room was very large, formal but with modern touches. Once again the details in the room were impressive including extra moldings, ceiling stencils, and antique air vents. All the furniture was comfortable including the spacious curved couch that gave a splash of modern d\u00e9cor, in an otherwise more traditionally elegant room setting. The large bathroom was full of marble and included a deep soaking tub, separate shower, and separate water closet. There were also three mirrors framed with faux gold edges that some may consider over the top d\u00e9cor. This type of thing pops up in a few areas of the hotel. Our only complaint about the room was that the balcony did not have any furniture to sit outside and enjoy the view. It seemed that most balconies at the hotel lacked furniture. All the public areas of the hotel are stunning, some with amazing woodwork. It is all very impressive and fun just to walk around and discover each room and area of the hotel. The hotel information states that the design of the hotel is modeled after the work of Addison Minzer, the famed Palm Beach architect of The Breakers, and it is easy to see why. The exterior of the hotel is also very attractive. Walking around the hotel property is a must and it gives you the chance to enjoy the fountains, statues, and even an antique fire truck. The overall effect is a luxury old European resort, but completely modern and in excellent shape. We had breakfast each morning in Amaya which is a little less formal looking then other areas of the hotel and has outdoor seating available. The food and service were very good. We used the adult lap pool which is in a nice courtyard surrounded by the hotel on three sides. The family pools are in a more open area with nice views of the hillside and golf course. The gym is very nice with enough equipment to complete a full workout. Next to the gym is a full luxurious spa that is only available for a fee if you are not having a treatment. Since the hotel provides free internet, it is an even trade I guess. Although the hotel is not near anything, everything is easy to get to within a half an hour. We enjoyed making our way back at the end of our day to a beautiful and quiet oasis that was well worth a little extra drive. Not to be left out was the always friendly and helpful staff.

Our travel agent found us a fantastic package at this hotel which is only 20 minutes from our home in the SD area but it seems like a world away. The hotel is several miles inland from the ocean, north of the city of San Diego. Freeway access is excellent- a mile or two east of I-5. Our package included golf for two, overnight accommodation, breakfast credit, and a certificate to use at the spa. It was an amazing value and I will look for it again. The hotel lobby, library, bar,etc are strikingly handsome and comfortable. The staff could not be any more friendly (in a sincere manner) and helpful. The hotel grounds are immaculate. The room was probably the nicest one I have stayed in. Everything from the room size, furnishings, bed/ bedding, huge tub, marble floor in bathroom, TV's, balcony, and room safe large enough for a laptop were first rate. Seriously, this was nice. Our room had a comfortable patio overlooking (from third floor) the adult pool. The front desk staff asked which newspapers (you get two) we would like in the AM. They sent a nice note and a dessert in honor of the birthday celebration. All the staff members were really gracious and helpful. We had breakfast on the patio of the Amaya restaraunt. We have previously dined at their 5 diamond (pricey but totally worth it) Addison restaurant but did not go there this trip- it is fantastic however. There is also a grill room at the golf course and a coffee bistro that serves light breakfast and lunch in the main part of the hotel. The adult area pool has a large hot tub with these comfortable outdoor mattress lounges to rest on next to the water. The cocktail waitress was attentive and friendly. There is a separately located family pool (three pools including two pools for kids of various sizes/ages). This has its own bar.etc, The golf course actually functions as a private club with access for hotel guests. It is a Tom Fazio design and is a terrific course. We had to take a caddy (part of the package, excluding gratuity). The idea of the caddy was great although ours did not come across as too friendly or interested (perhaps the only negative of the stay) but others may be friendlier. The golf was really great though. Back at the hotel there was complimentary fresh raspberry lemonade and cookies in the lobby to refresh/snack after golf. The Grand Del Mar exceeded all my expectations.

We had a King Fairway view room on the third (their highest) floor. The room is dreamy. Original art work hangs in the warm, lavishly decorated room, crown molding and stenciled designs are etched on the ceiling and lush linens, a soft bed and a gold renassaince framed Sony plasma t.v. are among the highlights. In the bathroom, the tub was extra deep and the shower larger than most hotels. The dual sink vanity had tons of counter space and lovely amenities, including a small plasma t.v. above the counter. The closet was quite large and the robes and slippers were plush. The food at this hotel excels at Addison, their five diamond, five star restaurant. The prices are appropriate and not excessive. The food is exquisite. The wine list was extensive. We had the prix fixe menu with wine pairings and it was probably the best dining experience we've ever had. I'll assure you, we are foodies and quite picky when it comes to restaurant food, so I don't make this recommendation lightly. The food at Amaya is good but not in league with Addison. In room dining was quick, delicious and always got our order right. Above all, remember that if a mistake is made with your order or with the service, let the manager know and he or she will be sure that you are happy or compensated for your trouble. They are not stingy here. This is true with all of their restaurants and their service in general. The spa was so relaxing and inviting. There are fresh fruits and nuts to munch on and all sorts of herbal teas as well. There are actual day beds to lay on before or after a treatment, as well as a whirlpool and sauna. The massage treatments as well were outstanding. The pools are all very nice with lovely cushioned lounges and heated even in late January. The grounds are green and lush. It is a short drive to the beach, if that is where you want to head. The concierge here is wonderful and will help you with anywhere you want to go.

After reading all the other reviews, I can say that the hotel is exactly as descibed by everyone else. The approach to the hotel is a long driveway. From the minute you see the hotel, the luxuriousness of the property and location is apparent. We booked a standard double king guest room. After much consideration, we decided to share the room with our two boys (normally, we get them a separate room but given the \"credit crunch\", we thought that may be slightly extravagant this year). We had the cheapest view in the property of the gardens, but we were more than happy with our lovely view. Given the location, all views seem to be gorgeous and we were glad we didn't upgrade to a golf view. The rooms are spacious but the bathrooms were MASSIVE. One of the nicest bathrooms I have ever seen, due to the size and design. The outside swimming pools are gorgeous and we took advantage of the heated pools to get our daily swim in even on Christmas day. Most of the staff thought we were crazy but coming from London the weather was very mild! I had a pedicure in the spa and the service was great - a really good pedicure. Well worth the money. We ate in the Amaya restaurant on Christmas eve and the food was excellent. My partner said it was the most \"melt in your mouth\" beef he had ever been served in a restaurant. We had a lovely festive christmas brunch on christmas day. All the staff were fabulous and the food choice was perfect. The most noticeable part of the hotel are the great staff that the management employ. Every member of staff we met was genuinely helpful and interested in making sure you had a fabulous stay in the hotel. There was a great sense of pride and professionalism amongst the staff. I would most definitely recommend this as the hotel to stay in during a trip to San Diego. Is the hotel expensive - YES! But, it truly is a luxurious place to stay and in the end you get what you pay for. If i had to make any criticisms of the hotel, I would make two. 1) it seems ridiculous to charge a \"valet\" parking fee when the hotel is so spacious ( our rate had this included but i would be annoyed at having to pay a daily rate to park in the middle of the countryside) 2) we thought that a 22% service charge on the Christmas brunch was very steep, especially as it was a buffet!!!!!!!!!!! Our service charge for Christmas Day was $68 and the meal was only $40 per child and $80 per adult, with one bottle of wine on top. As Europeans, we thought this service charge was too high especially as we were getting up to get the food ourselves. I did leave this in my comments to the management.

In the words of the in-room guest book: \"...inspired by the rich, decorative arts of Spain, Portugal, Italy and Morroco\"; \"colorful palette, graceful arched doorways, rotundas, vibrant tile, wood-beamed ceilings, ornate stone and wrought-iron accents, decorative columns, parquet flooring and gracious verandas.\". More simply put, you walk in and say \"Wow!\" - several times. First impressions were exceptional, from the eucalyptus-scented hand towels presented at the front desk during check-in, to the fresh lemonade, iced tea, and cookies and huge, aromatic, floral arrangement in the lobby. The concierge desk was very nice and helpful, especially Gabrielle and Lynette. We asked their advice every day. We requested and got a room with a fairway (golf course) view - the one downside is there's only a standing balcony, with insufficient room for chairs to sit and enjoy the view. We found the room to be very luxurious - all the amenities you could possibly want and more. The room (389) had a great layout, including a bathroom with a huge tub, two sinks, separate shower and toilet, and a folding window above the tub that opens into the main bedroom. There are lots of subtle, sometimes hidden extras, like a vanity with a top that opens up to reveal a large mirror and provide a compartment for your wife's things. The bedroom offered plenty of drawer space, slide-out table tops, a beautiful corner couch, cushions, and ottoman for relaxing, and a large flat screen TV on the wall. Two newspapers were delivered to the room each day, and we were asked if we wanted any others. Valet parking is the only available option, and they charge quite a bit for it ($30 plus tips). I complained because I didn't see this spelled out up front until my reservation was confirmed - the resort very kindly said they would waive the fee. Each time you leave the premises, the valet offers bottles of cold water for the road. Nice. A plus for us was that we rarely heard or saw any other people in the adjacent rooms - either the walls are nice and thick or no one was in them. A couple of relatively minor downsides: We only got turndown service on the first night of our four night stay. Not sure why. We loved it when we got it. We were offered and accepted an in-room coffee maker, but housekeeping just didn't seem to know how to handle this extra. They consistently failed to clean and provision it, even bringing coffee bags without filters on the last day. On a similar note, we requested extra towels (to their credit, the hotel asks before you arrive), but housekeeping had to be reminded to keep replacing them. We used in-room dining several times, but got tired of it. Would have liked some simpler, less \"frou frou\" options to choose from. We switched to muffins from the coffee shop (Cent'Anni) for the last couple of mornings. Speaking of dining, we opted not to eat at their highly touted restaurant, Addison - settling instead for \"second best\", Amaya. It was fine - great decor, nice waiters, good food, very classy - frankly it was hard for us to believe Amaya wasn't the best! I can't emphasize enough how pleasant and accommodating the staff was. We had the feeling they would do anything within their power to make our stay a nice one (and they succeeded). Also, the resort is absolutely beautiful.

I highly recommend this resort to everyone.", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bakersfield, CCA", "Title": "\u201cUtter Perfection\u201d", "Author": "Civillit1", "ReviewID": "UR19282100", "Content": "I was confused. I looked at the initial reviews and saw sixteen 5's and four less than 5's and had to wonder why? How do 80% of people adore a place without fail and 10% say is is a bad Motel 6 (two 2's). I now see. People who find this property sub-standard in any way complained of their experience from a lunch stay here. And their complaints rate just as valid as all of us who have had the pleasure to truly experience a first class hotel. At least lie and say you have more experience with one of the top hotels in the country before you trash it publicly. Put your name and face up to be scrutinized and laughed at for daring to spend more time writing a review than you spent in the hotel. The hotel is superb. First lass in all respects.. From the front desk clerk escorting you to a room to the concierge calling the Manager of Addison (a top flight restaurant within the hotel) to squeeze a party of 7 in for dinner same day when we had been turned away four times. The grounds are immaculate, the staff professional and friendly. Amaya, their casual dining location is superb. Don't miss the fig, gorgonzola and Balsamic flat bread or the lobster bisque. I have stayed worldwide and in some of the top rated hotels in the world. This deserves to be counted among them.", "Date": "August 23, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Grand Del Mar", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d781627-Reviews-The_Grand_Del_Mar-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$442 - $541*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">5300 Grand Del Mar Court</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92130</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515648", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b7/94/b7944b216a6bfc3bfd9faf52098d9ead5large.jpg"}}
