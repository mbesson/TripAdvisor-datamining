When I am looking for a hostel (NOT a hotel), I expect a lower price, a bed and a shower. We paid 172 Eur. for three nights, which would have been decent enough. However. The mattress was so bad I got bruises on my body from sticking springs. The shower was broken and we could not wash up normally - the water was running everywhere except for the shower head. The room was incredibly small (as opposed to what was shown in the pictures online), not overly clean either. On top of everything, I found it reasonable to ask for a discount for all the inconveniences during our checkout. However, the staff was unwilling to even consider my request, nor did they provide me with the contacts of the manager, finding an excuse that he is spending time with his family (instead of being available and responsible for what is happening at his hostel). I do not reccommend Aqua Alegre for those who want to get accommodation for the value of their money.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNot helpful\u201d", "Author": "mcleanar", "ReviewID": "UR117515653", "Content": "I booked this online.

The good point is the terrasse where you can have a drink ( the reception sells bottles of wine and it is not expensive) and even enjoey your breakfast, there is always someone to talk with ! Oh and the elevator is a real experience ! Very old one, really nice ( typical from the 40s-50s) but can bear only 2 persons ( we tried 4 and we actually blocked it!!)

Location is excellent and only a 5 minute walk to La Ramblas. Barcelona tip: don\u2019t bother with the open top Barcelona tour bus, a day pass for the tube is much cheaper (about \u20ac5), quieter and you don\u2019t feel rushed to move on constantly, the Sagrada Familia alone takes up 2/3 hours of the day.", "Date": "February 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ibiza", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in a great location.\u201d", "Author": "ibizaking99", "ReviewID": "UR51468287", "Content": "We stayed in Agua Alegre for 10 nights in May and it was fantastic- The employess, the location, the service, breakfast and cleanness of the hotel were all great.

The hotel was clean, although very basic, room was a good size with a view over a large courtyard and view across the terraces of a number of different buildings within the city. We paid \u20ac60 for two of us for one night and booked only a week in advance which i thought was rather reasonable, especially around this time of the year when Barcelona is awash with travelers, and booked through http://www.laterooms.com Our accomodation: Our accommodation comprised of a double room, with a comfortable double bed, two chairs and a table, a large window, ceiling fan, adequate lighting and cupboards. The hotel also provided us with two towels each and an extremely detailed map of the city! The bathroom facilities for the room we stayed in was shared but was very clean and relatively new. Finding the Hostel & Access: The hotel/hostel was relatively easy to find but only if you know the EXACT address!!! So when visiting bear this in mind, you will need to look for the building number.. 47 i believe. The front of the hotel looks like the entrance to a block of flats, and there is no obvious sign to show its location on the street! Reception is up a flight of stairs and for any luggage that cannot be carried up the stairs there is a very small cage type lift that can be used to access most floors. For this reason i must say that disabled customers or people with large amounts of luggage may have some difficulty accessing this accommodation. Facilities nearby: On the same road as the hostel/hotel there is a supermarket and a mercedona can be found a few roads away. Also opposite is a lovely small bar/restaurant called the moviebar that plays old films, serves cocktails and great popular food with a Japanese twist! The closest METRO station is GIRONA and this is only a two blocks away, about a 3min walk. Conclusion: Overall we were pleased with our stay, the guy at reception although claimed to have been his first day working there was very helpful and i would definitely consider returning in the future. The location is pretty central and easy to get to by tube, this area of Barcelona felt much less threatening than other areas at night and my girlfriend and i felt it much safer than hostels and areas around such places as Las Ramblas.", "Date": "July 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cPerfect -- convenient, clean, sweet, cheap\u201d", "Author": "bearfeet", "ReviewID": "UR12782868", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 5 days over New Years.

My room (#19) was clean, large and airy, as was the private bath. The rooms are basic: no TV, no phone, no A/C (they do have ceiling fans). The lack of A/C means your windows are open on warm days. Barcelona can be a noisy city, so if you're a light sleeper, ear plugs may be helpful. Although after using them the 1st night, I didn't bother afterwards, and had no issues with noise. Not all rooms have a private bath; those without use the shared facilities on each floor (which were spotless and well-appointed). The bed was adequate; a little squeaky, but not uncomfortable. The sheets were getting a little thin, but they were clean, as were the towels that were provided. The terrace is a nice place to sit and have a drink (note - bring your own; the hotel supplies only coffee, tea or bottled water), to have breakfast or just to read. The front-desk staff were very helpful and friendly. The location in the Eixample is excellent. There's an entrance to the Passeig de Gracia RENFE station one block north, which is convenient when coming from or going to the airport, or connecting to Sants station for longer train journeys. There are also several metro stops nearby, You're a two minute walk to the Passeig de Gracia; 5-8 minutes to Placa de Catalunya and the top of La Rambla, 8 minutes from the Palau de Music Catalan and the old town, etc. If you go, you'll find the place isn't well-signed. Look for the street number; at the entrance, just to the side of the door is a small card indicating that you've found the right spot. Go up the elevator to the next floor; that's where reception is. The hotel markets to gay and lesbian travellers, but when I was there, there was a mix of both gay clientele as well as straight couples, mothers and daughters travelling together, even a businessman or two. For a city where a hotel stay of just a few nights can put you in the poor-house, the Agua Alegre was a great option for me.", "Date": "September 23, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Agua Alegre", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d678843-Reviews-Agua_Alegre-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$67 - $132*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">c/ Roger de Lluria, 47</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08009</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "678843", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/c9/bb/c9bb781690c3e1953b65772a6afc2b047large.jpg"}}
