Embankment and Charing Cross train stations are a minute away. Other conveniences are super close (supermarket, chemist, net cafes), and it's safe to walk around there at night because it's so busy - a plus for a lone traveller. However, the place itself is pretty old and dusty and a little bit firetrap-ish! I stayed at the Royal Adelphi twice with three weeks between and got two different rooms. And I found the quality and size of the rooms varies significantly. The first room was tiny and the window was right near the building's air-con unit or something that made a really loud whirring noise all night. Plus, the shower was pretty low water-pressure and fairly grimy. But the second room I was in was much quieter and larger - especially the bathroom, which was also much better quality. Go figure. Breakfast was fine - nothing fancy. The staff were friendly enough - especially compared to what I was expecting after all the warnings I got from people about how surly London is meant to be! Like most big cities, London is a pricy, pricy place. So, while 75 pounds is pretty pricy in my books (thank you exchange rate!) - especially for a place so old and unkempt - I was hard-pressed to find better accommodation for this price in such a perfect location. And when it comes down to it, if you're in town to see the sights, you're not really gonna spend all day in your hotel room. And it really helps to be close to all the things you're going out to see - you can come and go as you please all day to drop off your shopping or to have an afternoon nap before the theatre.

Via my user name read this in connection with my earlier review save me repeating myself. This was the 5th time in 12 months I have stayed at the Royal Adelphi and I love it. This hotel is about location not 5* luxury. Work colleagues have also now started to stay at the Royal Adelphi due to it's fantastic central location for the room rate. Jackie the receptionist as always was very pleasant as are the other reception staff, it is just that I have forgotten their names. Ask for a room at the rear, the front of the hotel can get noisy. Their is no air conditioning but the in room fans seem to do a good job once you fathom out how to use them. The hotel has internet access and I recommend you visit walkit.co.uk which you can the see where the sights are from your hotel. Print out the route and save tube and bus fares. The hotel is so close to all the main sightseeing attractions if only you knew how to walk there by the shortest route. A pub right next door to the Royal Adelphi called the Princess of Wales has an excellent restaurant on the first floor open between 12 noon and 10pm. Well worth checking out for a pre-theatre meal. If you accept this hotel is a bit down at heal for decoration and furnishings, for price it cannot be beaten especially with a continental breakfast included in your room rate.", "Date": "June 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Location\u201d", "Author": "Gilly-uk", "ReviewID": "UR13574574", "Content": "Not the most fabulous hotel I've ever stayed at....probably one of the more basic.

It in a small street with Embankment Station at one end and Charing Cross Station at the other. A 5-10 minute walk will take you to Trafalger Suare, London Eye Covent Garden, Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey. The stop for the open top Original Tour Bus is 2 mins away at Embankment. The Strand is located at one end of the street with a huge range of shops, bars and restaurants not to mention the theatres!! Plenty of places to eat and drink including Starbucks, Costa Coffee, Princess of Wales Pub, a wine bar, Italian restaurants, a bistro, Jpanese fast food and loads more are located in the same street, In saying that we were never disturbed at night and slept very well Staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful, looking after our luggage when we checked out.

Indeed, the location of this hotel is absolutely superb (if you don't mind the noisy street under the window) but my single room was of quite poor quality. It was a closet, really, quite old and not what you would call \"squeaky clean\". I found the absence of an elevator, or rather, the presence of very steep and run-down stairs, a drawback as well.
