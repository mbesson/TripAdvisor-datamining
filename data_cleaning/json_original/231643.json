It was a shame because the hotel is really good value for money when compared to other Madrid hotels of the same standard and the staff on the reception were fine - pleasant and helpful. Examples of the breakfast staff's attitude: even though I said a cheery 'Buenos dias' every morning on arrival, I got a mumbled almost grudging response. When we sat down we were made to feel like we were an inconvenience just for being there - no one asked us if we wanted tea or coffee - we had to ask for it, then when it was brought up it was plonked hard on the table. Bearing in mind we were a party of 6 and asked for tea for 6 people (in Spanish!), the male waiter brought 2 small flasks of tea which barely made 3 cupfulls. No milk was brought. Plus we often had to get up and go around the other spare tables to find enough cups and saucers, & cutlery, for our group! The staff were so grumpy that in the end we felt awkward asking for anything. All they seemed to do was clear up and replenish the self-serve food, they never seemed to pay any attention to the people that were in there, it was as if we were invisible! This somewhat spoit my impression of this hotel. That being said the quality and variety of the food on offer at breakfast was good. Waiting staff - please take some lessons in customer service. Bedrooms were a good size, storage space was limited but fine for a few days' trip. Standard of decor was good but if I am honest the colour of the furnishings - everything grey and black - made the rooms quite gloomy, almost depressing. We had 3 twin rooms on 3rd floor at the back of the hotel, overlooking the pool, and they were quite dark inside. We actually wrote beforehand asking for rooms with a lot of natural light, (as previous reviewers had said their rooms were dark and gloomy) - so maybe they are all like it! Bathrooms were modern with shower area, no bath. Walls are thin, you know when your neighbours are in the shower! and the wooden floors mean you can occasionally hear people walking around in heels, but not too bad on the whole. There is nothing much to do near the hotel - which was expected as its in a residential area, except there's a good bar, with friendly staff, on the corner opposite the hotel, with cheap drinks compared to the city centre bars. A fairly big supermarket is just around the corner from hotel in Calle Juan Bravo. The metro station Diego de Leon is a one-minute walk from hotel and has good connections to central Madrid (about 20 mins journey). The metro was very easy to use, efficient and safe, we returned back one night at 1:15am - plenty of people on the trains even at that time. Trains run regularly until 2am. Madrid centre around the Sol area was extremely crowded day and night, just as central London is. Lovely authentic (not typically touristy) bar just off the Plaza Mayor (go to the far corner of the plaza and down some concrete steps to get to the street called Calle Cuchilleros - the bar is called the Arco de Cuchilleros (tableo flamenco) and has flamenco dancers on stage at 10.30pm - you pay a supplement on your first drink to cover the cost of the dancers (first drink was 11euros) then susequent drinks are normal prices, but the dancers are top flamenco dancers and the dancing is as authentic and enjoyable as you will get, second only to what I have seen previously in Seville. Taxi from airport to hotel 30euros each way (40euros on Sundays). Would I recommend this hotel? For value for money, for a short trip, with good connections to the centre.....it's ok.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Julian's, Malta", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for money\u201d", "Author": "foodie978", "ReviewID": "UR116301572", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 nights last May, this hotel is very modern, is really well located in the Salamanca area surrounded by shops and restaurants within walking distance.

The rooms (in light-absorbing black and dark grey) are undoubtedly stylish, but so little light is provided that it feels like an experiment designed to give everyone the experience of being partially sighted - I had to use a torch to read the instructions for the safe. The bathroom (wet-room) looks great, but doesn't actually work (the water goes everywhere) and the 'uber-modern' basin doesn't have anywhere to put the soap. Oh well, 'style-over-substance'.again.This is a pity, because it's reasonably-priced, the location is good, the restaurant for diner and breakfast is above average, and there is secure parking for around 20 euros a night (reasonable by Madrid standards). More serious is the attitude of some staff - most notably at night in our experience. Other annoyances were: a WiFi that didn't seem to work in our room; 55 TV channels, none of which were in English; a mini-bar that contained nothing alcoholic (apparently a management decision . . . in case children use it!;, a bar that refuses to serve you after 11.30pm.; and poor sound insulation - notably in the corridors.

I was quite reluctant to write a review about this hotel because it had no definitive faults as such, it was simply not a 4 star which is what it was advertised as being. It was a 3 star hotel at most and I say this having stayed at two other 4 star hotels within a 5 day period during this last week - [Puerto de Gredos and the Confortel Suites which definately were 4 stars]. The reception area was a little drab and in need of a bit of varnish but I wondered whether I was being a little petty given how very friendly and helpful the reception staff were. They provided me with a metro map to get around and even helped me with some directions [for the following day] and this was at 2am in the morning when I arrived there!! The room itself was quite small compared to the Confortel Suites I had stayed at a few nights before, and despite having all the little things that travellers like in hotels [mini bar, toiletry extras like free comb, toothbrush, loofer, razor, body milk, etc] there was something not quite classy about it. It was almost as if it had pretensions of appealing to the business traveller without quite attaining this. Little things were offputting like the wide and cumbersome heater on the wall opposite my bed which seemed to take up so much room given that the room was already quite small; the lack of choice on the tv which catered almost exclusively for Spanish people [it would have been nice if they provided at least an English speaking news channel like the other hotels I visted] and the wi-fi connection was disappointing as it was not free and for the couple of hours I was there I was not prepared to pay the amount that it would have cost. All in all the hotel was not horrific.. just not too luxurious. It felt like a downmarket version of a true 4 star hotel. Parodoxically, the hotel was placed in a reasonably posh area of Madrid [so I was told on a few occasions]. The redeeming factors were the staff and the hotel's proximity to the Metro station [about a 40 second walk away] and the fact that the hotel was really trying.The following morning when I went down to pay my mini bar bill [I consumed one orange juice] they told me not to worry about it which was nice of them! All in all stay here if you need a hotel for a night or two but really if you stayed much longer you'd fell claustrophobic.", "Date": "March 10, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Zenit Abeba", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d231643-Reviews-Hotel_Zenit_Abeba-Madrid.html", "Price": "$74 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">C/ Alcantara 63</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28006</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "231643", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/28/4f/b8/recepcion.jpg"}}
