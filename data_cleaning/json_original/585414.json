The floor we stayed on (8) was humid and smelled musty. Our room was very loud with wind noise and jet engine noise combined. As another poster stated, food prices are very high, on par with a high-quality steakhouse without the quality. It was good, but not good enough to justify the price. I liked the fact that they had shuttle service to nearby Grapevine for a $5 day pass, which gave us a chance to wander around downtown and enjoy the wineries, food and eclectic shops. My biggest complaint is that I called ahead and requested that all down items be removed from our room due to my wife's allergies. When she checked in, the front desk confirmed that there was not to be down in the room. When she got the room, there were down pillows on the bed. She requested that they be replaced, then we left for dinner. When we returned at about 10:30 p.m., the pillows on one of the two queen beds had been replaced but not the others. We asked for that to be fixed and waited nearly 40 minutes -- the last 15 in the hallway outside our room because the feathers make it impossible for her to breathe normally -- for the task to be completed. Then, even though I let the housekeeper into the room and we were right there when she finished, she looked at us, then closed and locked the door behind her. Luckily we had a key. We don't expect the down to be taken care of -- we call every time and every time we have to ask again once we get to our room. HOWEVER, for someone to literally only fix the problem halfway defies logic.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel, and convenient if you're flying in\u201d", "Author": "hammkse", "ReviewID": "UR128417181", "Content": "The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable.

At the Regency, to catch a flight in the morning, you have to take a shuttle, which only runs every 20 minutes becuase it's the most retardedly-designed airport on the planet and it takes forever to get to a terminal. This is NOT a hotel where you just walk straight into the airport and catch a plane. They have Mr. G's restaurant, which was fine but didn't knock my socks off.

The high points: free parking, renovated rooms, airport views, decent restaurant, on-airport, lots of elevators Low points: no status recognition beyond free internet, front desk staff quality lower than other Hyatts I've recently stayed at, nowhere near anything due to on-airport location, shower height extremely low (I'm 6'3 and I had to watch my head while in the shower to avoid hitting the ceiling). This hotel is not a bad hotel and it kills most other brands' airport hotels out of the park. However it is quite clear they are attempting to differentiate between this hotel and the nearby Grand Hyatt. I was at this hotel for about 15 hours total, of which 8 of them were sleep. The rest were spent in the restaurant and in my room. The restaurant staff were the highlight of the experience. Everyone was insanely friendly and I had long conversations with two of them about life, family, and work, it was really great since I was travelling alone for work. The food however wasn't up to the same quality level, it was acceptable though. The front desk staff were friendly enough but when I checked in they did not recognize the HGP Platinum/Diamond line nor did they recognize my status at all beyond informing me that my rate included breakfast (AAA rate). I know that welcome gifts are not part of the platinum guaranty but this is the first Hyatt I have been at where I did not receive a welcome gift, let alone any recognition at all. I also did not receive a preferred room that I requested (runway view, nor a higher floor). As I was travelling on a Saturday I find it hard to imagine that all the higher floor and/or runway view rooms were taken. Aside from that this hotel was quite nice. The rooms are small but can allow for a lot of space. There is a movable desk and the bed is very comfortable. The TV was of decent quality though the reception on some of the channels was subpar, which is something I have a hard time fathoming in this day and age. There was a desk chair and separate lounging chair in the room as well. The bathroom was well stocked with both mouthwash and toothpaste and apart from the extremely tight fit in the shower the bathroom renovations were a definite plus. If I were to go to DFW again I'd likely stay at the Grand Hyatt as I think it would be a better experience but I wouldn't be disappointed or against staying at this Hyatt Regency again. If you're trying to save some cash or just need a bed to crash in for a night then the Regency is the place for you. Though it seems as though the Grand Hyatt DFW (I've never been) is a better place for longer stays, though I can't imagine why you'd have a long stay at DFW unless you're an aviation consultant.

You can also get the airport tolls validated at the bell desk or the front desk. Service: Good and friendly faces throughout. Rooms: All renovated overall so the quality is good with new furnishings. Room size is good and the bed is comfortable. There is an iPhone dock that serves as an alarm clock. The bathroom does not have a tub but just a large shower. Large flat screen TV is the standard these days. Runway noise was not noticeable. Breakfast: Booked on a corporate rate that included buffet breakfast (normal rate is around $17). Quality is decent. The omelette station does a good job, and the fruit selection was excellent. Cereal selection could have been improved though. Hyatt Place is better in that area. Coffee tasted diluted and poor. Other facilities: Didn't try the pool or the fitness center. There is ample convention space at the basement and a nice bar area.

My room has spacious and comfortable, although dark - the half-window looked out on a wall of the hotel and the inner courtyard of a parking garage. The hotel bar is comfortable with a good menu, but gets noisy and is too small. You can call for a shuttle from the DFW terminals, but it's just as easy to walk from terminal C, if you're OK with finding your way across a parking garage and going up and down a few half staircases. So - ugly setting, but if you're at a conference, that doesn't matter. I would discourage vacationers from staying here, there's no public transportation to DFW and cab rides are far from anywhere.

Having stayed at the Grand Hyatt on our arrival in the US 3 weeks earlier, we were a bit concerned that this might be a disappointing comparison. Not at all. It was an exceptional hotel. Overall, I preferred our experience at this hotel. All of the staff were extremely friendly and went out of their way to be helpful and our room was terrific - large, very comfortable and clean (not as modern and glamorous as the GH, but still a great room) and quiet despite overlooking one of the runways. We ate at Jacobe's Grille for both breakfast and dinner. Breakfast was delicious, but dinner was the real winner! By far the best meal and service during our time in the US. We also grabbed a couple of take away salads from the coffee bar and these too were really good. Our only difficulty was actually getting to the Regency from Terminal A. We figured there would be a shuttle service and that there would be clear signs on how to access it. However we couldn't find signs and being Australian, we had no cell phone connection to call the hotel. We were advised by an Information guy to take an airport bus to a certain point and walk the rest of the way. DON'T DO THIS!! If you haven't organised the shuttle, take a cab. However, the free shuttle is such an excellent service it's a pity not to take advantage of it. I suggest the hotel give clear instructions on how to access the shuttle on their website AND reservation confirmation to avoid the inconvenience we experienced. Despite our shaky start, I would certainly recommend this hotel if you're flying into any of the terminals other than Terminal D. It's hard not to recommend the Grand if you're flying into Terminal D purely for the convenience.

There are several restaurants, incredibly friendly and efficient front desk staff, a nice, large room with all of the amenities, good wi-fi service, a comfortable bed and a clean bathroom. But my only issue was the HVAC system, which, even after being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fixed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by maintenance was still problematic. My room had 2 queen beds and still had ample room for walking around. The desk and its chair were comfortable and the TV swirled so I could work on my computer at the desk and still watch. There are three pillows on each bed. The shampoo, conditioner and soap are already in the shower so look there before calling down to housekeeping. My issue with the HVAC was it could not achieve the desired temperature with an early freeze in Dallas. I called maintenance and they set someone to fix it. She assured me it was fixed, left the thermostat set at 78 and told me to find the temperature I liked and then re-set the thermostat. The room never went above 71.4. Not cold but still in need of fixing. I went to the lobby bar for a quick dinner, a chicken quesadilla and a cheeseburger with fries. The quesadilla was really a soft taco they ran through a Panini press. The avocado was under-ripe and the chicken had that jelly-like texture and there was loads of melted cheese. I would not recommend. The burger was good but mine had a wide variation in the salt. One bite had none and then the next my head snapped back. The French fries were basic frozen in 25 pound bags and fried when ordered. The server was excellent and friendly. Hey it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lobby bar at an airport hotel, better than I expected, but not great. There is also a coffee maker in the room. Unfortunately housekeeping only left de-caf.

Whoever thought it was a good idea to have a open shower with no door should be fired. Half of the water from our showers ended up on the bathroom floor. We used all our towels cleaning up the pool of water every day. But the most insane thing about this hotel is the way their employees try to hustle their guests. Instead of calling you a cab they will pressure you into taking a car service which just so happens to have three lincolns sitting out front. DO NOT BELIEVE A WORD THE CONCiERGE/DOORMAN TELLS YOU about the car service being the cheaper option. Tell them to shutup and call you a cab. They are clearly in cahoots with thiscar service company and flat out lied to us that the car service was cheaper than the cab. SHAME ON MGMT for allowing this type of behavior. THEN, while we sat in the bar having a drink, we were approached by an older man who said he worked in the hotel restaurant. He tried to pressure us into cancelling our dinner reservations at Pappas Bros claiming it was really far away. THIS IS NOT TRUE. Pappas Bros is 10 miles from the hotel. We eventually had to tell him we were meeting friends there just so he would leave us alone! Extremly unprofessional and annoying. I was disappointed at the dishonesty by the employees.

With that in mind, the noise level was not bad; although you can hear the aircraft taking off and landing, it was not so loud as to keep us awake. One significant limitation to this airport is the proximity to anything. If you do not have a car, there is little choice in dining options other than the outlets within the hotel which, although good, were quite expensive. There is a shuttle to Grapevine for a fee but we did not use it. I was informed by a staff member that if you needed to use a cab to get in to town, it would cost upwards of $60-$70.

Even though this place is right at the airport, you do not hear any of the jets landing or taking off. I was very impressed with the sound proofing and it made for a great nights sleep! I would recommend this to anyone in town on business or pleasure and wanting a place to stay, very convenient to the airport and needing to fly out on American.

Beware of the expense report.\u201d", "Author": "brmusicman", "ReviewID": "UR65229112", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel in April, 2010 for a variety of business meetings, including a couple at the hotel. The hotel's facilities were fantastic: stylish lobby; roomy guest rooms with great design, wonderful and flexible desk area, and comfortable bedding; and a huge conference center that appeared to be recently renovated and avoided some of the typical hotel-ballroom-blandness by having several locally-themed displayed on Texas businesses and leaders that were actually pretty interesting. The fitness center was great: a wide range of cardio equipment and free weights, open 24-hours, nice towels, even a wine refrigerator filled with cool towels to use post-workout! I was very impressed with the physical plant of the hotel; it's significantly nicer than its 1980s-looking exterior would suggest and certainly was a refreshing change-of-pace from usually design-less airport hotels I've stayed at in other cities. Service-wise, I had a mixed experience. I had dinner at the fancy steakhouse in the hotel; the service was superb. The front desk and housekeeping service was good. The meetings staff seemed to do a good job. I had a more mixed experience in the business center, where the staff was laughably inflexible. I had dinner in the restaurant off the lobby one night, and the service there was horrible -- I waited forever to be taken to a table, and once at the table my server was slow and disinterested. Nothing is more frustrating than watching the staff be more concerned about re-setting the tables for breakfast than it is about clearing your food or bringing something out while it's still warm. The hotel is attached to DFW's parking garages. There's nothing nearby -- all restaurants, stores, etc. are either within security at DFW or outside of the (huge) airport complex (WAY beyond walking distance). So, in one sense, the location is very convenient, as no other hotel (except the other Hyatt) is on the airport's grounds. The downside, though, is that the on-airport location means that the hotel has you trapped when it comes to services and meals. It knows this...even though the room rate was reasonable, everything else was NOT. The most ridiculous was the business center, where computer access to print cost a minimum of $9.00 (plus a certain amount per page). An envelope cost money, as did copies, etc. I had some documents to copy that were sort of complicated (i.e., some pages needed to be copies, others didn't; some had to be blown up, others shurnk), and it was my strong preference to do the copying myself. The staff in the business center initially wouldn't allow me to do that, saying they couldn't be liable if I were injured by the copy machine. Come on. When I promised not to sue they agreed to let me make the copies so long as the business center associate stood next to me; this showed me that they were less concerned with liability and more concerned with nickel-and-diming me. I bet they sure are glad they didn't miss out on one chance to charge me $.10. The restaurant prices were also absurd. There is an a la carte, classic steakhouse attached to the hotel. It was a lovely meal, and a very nice restaurant at which you expected the prices to be elevated to match the quality of the service...but the prices were crazy expensive; it was nearly $100/person for a salad, entree, and glass of wine (and that was ordering with caution!). The regular restaurant wasn't that crazy, but my chicken breast entree was $26 -- add a salad and an iced tea, and you're talking a $40 dinner. The coffee bar's prices were similarly high. So, being connected to DFW is very convenient...but you PAY for that convenience! Overall, absent the bad experience in the restaurant and the bean counter in the business center, the hotel was very nice, but the hidden costs were higher than normal. So, balance the great facility and desire of being connected to DFW with the off-airport properties that are less expensive and have access non-hotel owned stores, restaurants, etc.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "CruiseWhere", "ReviewID": "UR63576730", "Content": "This is the first hotel that I have ever set foot in that when I checked in and requested a King Bed I was told \"I certainly think we can do that\".

We were a little surprised to find out that the hotel where the reunion was being held was actually at DFW, but once we got to the hotel, we were pleasantly surprised. The great service started with the valet, who kept our car for 20-30 minutes with no charge (valet is normally $25 per day) while we checked in and quickly cleaned up before going out. He also pointed out that, while he would love to park our car for us, there was free parking in the garage, and he told us how to get there. The line at check-in happened to be long when we drove in, but that was because there had been a bad storm the day before, and there were about 50 flights that were canceled, so people were scrambling to find a room. The long line was not a problem, though, as the efficient front desk staff moved very quickly and handled us in short order. The bellman got us and our luggage up to our room very quickly in the service elevator, since the guest elevators were completely overwhelmed right then. That is one downside to the hotel - apparently it's very popular with conventions, and there was a large teen convention during the week, resulting in a long wait for the elevators until the group checked out early Saturday morning. The room is very clean and must have been remodeled recently. The furnishings are all modern and sleek - very comfortable without being cold. The king bed was comfortable, and there is a work desk on wheels with a desk chair, a chair with ottoman, and another side chair. The TVs are 32\" LCD, with a typical array of cable channels and PPV. The remodeling apparently cost $50 million, and the rooms were just completed within the last couple of years. The work that was done appears to be more than just the superficial paint and new TV - the entire room was redone, and the bathrooms and entry way was remodeled as well - tiles, fixtures, counter, sink - everything. It looks like a new hotel, not just a retouching a tired old hotel. The bathroom is divided up with the sink area, with a closet, and a separate shower / toilet area. The show has a half glass wall - no curtain - but is very roomy - it takes up the same area as the tub that was undoubtedly removed previously. There is a small balcony outside of a sliding door. Our view was of the airport over the parking garage - don't know if there are any really good views because you're at the airport. Opening it does bring in some outside air, but it also brings in the outside noise. It does help you realize how good a job the door does at keeping the airport noise out, though - you really have to be listening for the airplanes to notice them when the door is closed. The hotel has all the amenities you would expect from a large convention hotel - pool, fitness center, bar, several restaurants, gift shop, ATM machine, free boarding pass printout at the front desk. The wireless internet is $10.77 per day (maybe that works out to a round number with tax?), but if you join the Hyatt Gold Passport club then the internet is free. One note if you're driving - there is a toll to enter the airport. Make sure you bring your toll ticket into the hotel, and they will validate it for you - even if you don't valet park.", "Date": "June 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Booger County AR", "Title": "\u201cEarly flight out?

There were two water bottles (not refrigerated) were available for $4 each.

What set's this hotel apart? 1-Every room has a balcony. If you are an indoor worker, you appreciate getting \"fresh\" air on occasion. With balconies in every room, it is easy to open the door -though it can be noisy, and can be smelly (depends on the wind -Jet A fumes). If you like aviation though, these concerns are negated because this is an awesome place to watch aviation. Once you shut the door though, most sounds are cut off though you can hear the larger planes taking off with the door shut on occasion. 2 - Shower and bathroom -No tubs or shower curtains here (unless you do get one of the tub rooms). That is a huge difference if you are used to a shower at home. The bathroom is nice, large, and upscale. You will not get the cramped feeling. And the commode and sink area are separated by a door. A very nice bonus is the shower head. Other - rooms are sized right and are nicely decorated, though there are some cramped ones depending on where your room is. All rooms have ihome clock radios- a nice touch. Nice workspace - on the order of Marriott, but it is nice that the desk swivels out. There is also a big easy chair with ottoman - I know some Marriott rooms have sofa's but the easy chair is a nice place to sit- nicer than the chairs at Marriott. Workout facility is very nice. I am not an expert on work-out rooms though since I prefer to exercise outside (and this is a negative to this hotel since it is in the middle of the airport). However, there are multiple, high quality treadmills and other high quality equipment (stair climbers, bikes, and weight machines) in a very nice, comfortable facility with towels (available in a towel warmer), fruit and cold water. TV's (on different channels) line the walls and the equipment have built in TV's too. Concerns -This is obviously a convention hotel.

It would have been longer but another check-in line was opened when the line began forming. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and felt I received the same consideration had I paid full price ($129 per night).

A small, single cup coffee maker is provided along with enough coffee for three cups. There is a powerful hairdryer with probably the shortest cord I've ever had on a hairdryer, but it was ok. There's also an iron and ironing board in the closet. There were about 10 hangers and an extra blanket and pillow on the shelf. The bed. Oh, what a wonderful bed. I thought I had the perfect pillowtop mattress at home, but I was wrong. We slept wonderfully both nights. I believe there were three regular sized pillows and two king sized.

VERY NICE room for half the rack price and staff was VERY FRIENDLY. The rooms are well described in other's reviews so I'll just add two negatives: the bed was made with FLAT SHEETS ONLY (the Hyatt can't afford to use fitted sheets on their highly promoted Hyatt beds?) and the shower was a half-door walk-in SHOWER ONLY (be sure to put down the bath mat!) so taking a bath is not possible. The room was clean, but we were surprised to see our neighbor's room service trays out in the hallway for almost 24 hours. Be sure to try the Bananas Foster for Two at Jacob's Spring Grille - it's huge and delicious, but don't get caught hungry enough to pay $7.50 for a chicken salad sandwich at JETT'S coffee shop! Use the coasters in the vanity area for a free dessert and an upsize Starbuck's to get more bang for your buck. Also, the breakfast buffet was very good (great omelettes and Belgian waffles), but O.J. is an exorbitant extra charge not included in the $15 price. The pool has towel service for a few hours, but once the towels rung out, you have to ask the front desk to send more. Don't forget to have your airport PARKING VOUCHER VALIDATED coming and going and if you have a tolltag, don't use the tolltag entrances - use the \"public only\" ones, or you'll have to mess with paperwork to get the charges refunded to your tolltag account.

Despite the ugly exterior, this is a very modern, recently refurbished airport hotel with very comfortable rooms. Rooms: All rooms have been refurbished in the last 18 months. Each is equipped with Hyatt Grand beds. I'd say the description on the website is right on -- \"ultra-plush pillows, the softest sheeting, and thick down blankets\u00e2\u20ac\u201call piled atop irresistible pillow-top mattresses.\" The desk chair is comfortable, the large plasma screen TV gets a bunch of HD channels, and the central air conditioning gets very cold. I'd also give the shower a high grade as the shower head puts out a generous amount of water, the massage soap is fun, and the shower curtain bar is rounded (allowing extra space in the shower). Soundproofing gets an 8 out of 10. Rooms are very quiet however you can detect a faint amount of airplane noise on occassion (not really an issue as the airport doesn't seem to have too many flights between the hours of 10 PM and 6 AM). Location: Somewhat connected to Terminal C (you walk through 2 parking garages). Otherwise, call the Hotel from the phone bank by the baggage carousels in the various terminals and they'll send a shuttle to pick you up within 5-10 minutes. Service going back to the airport is even better as they have quite a few of these vans. Internet: Charge in the room is $10.77, however it's provided free in most of the meeting rooms downstairs and you can probably mooch a free connection if don't mind sitting in one of the public areas. Food: All of the food I've had has been provided as part of my Company's seminars and as a consequence, I wouldn't really say it was representative of what is served at Aces or Mister G's in the lobby. I've had a few drinks at Aces and it's about what you'd expect in a hotel bar. Nothing spectacular however there's generally a pretty lively crowd most nights. Staff: Everywhere. Always friendly and helpful. There always seems to be 3-4 people at the front desk. One thing I really like is how on most days an actual human calls with my wake up call. Seems like such a rarity these days. Complaints: Only one - it is cost prohibitive to go anywhere outside of the DFW complex, without renting a car, while staying at this hotel due to the arcane rate structure used by taxis in Dallas (specifically, the minimum charges and fees for taxis leaving/going to the DFW complex). We took a trip to a Rangers game one night (13 milies away) and it cost the 7 of us (one mini van) over $60 with tip each way. For a 6 mile ride to downtown Grapevine, the cost was over $30 with tip (3 people) one way. I would also be very careful when asking for a taxi through the hotel that they don't try to put you in one of their town cars. The minimum charge most of these rides is roughly $38 (this was a trip to downtown Grapevine, less than 6 miles away).

Large, well sound-insulated from the airport, beautifully decorated, newly renovated and those Hyatt beds really are as good as the publicity says they are. So why wouldn't I stay here again? Most people wouldn't probably go to an airport hotel for nine days, but I had a conference there for a week and then got snowed in for a couple of extra days. Over this time, the cracks really showed. I'll highlight (or should I say 'lowlight') the three worst: 1. The housekeeping at this hotel was the worst I have ever experienced, and this shocked me for a Hyatt. There were two days when my room simply never got serviced. In addition: - toiletries were not replaced even when completely empty, whether left on the counter or thrown away. Even when I rang to ask that replacements be left the following day, they were not. My colleague who was travelling with me found the same in her room. - the towels, which I'd hung back on the rack to signify I was happy to reuse them, were laundered/replaced each day. So much for environmental commitment. And each day something would be missing - no face cloths or one less towel. My favourite was the complete absence of a bathmat for three random days. Slippery marble floor....fun. - after the first night, they would not leave me a room service breakfast card (the one you hang on your door) despite several requests both to housekeeping and room service. It was laughably ridiculous how many times I had to ring and request one and still there were two mornings that I had to go to the restaurant because I couldn't order in-room dining. 2. The other key issue for this hotel is the food. Fantastic selection if you're there for one or two nights. But beyond that the menu is extremely limited. It looks like they have several venues but when you look at the menu it's just not that different. Tex mex, tex mex and tex mex. There's the odd 'other' option but it's just not sufficient for a Hyatt. 3. At capacity, the hotel runs out of hot water. The snowstorm meant the hotel was full to the gills and I had a completely cold shower to wake up to. Again, not good enough for a Hyatt. While reception staff apologised when I raised these concerns with them, they did nothing and offered nothing. So to be frank I felt it was pro forma and not even slightly genuine. They had my platinum Hyatt membership number and have not followed up in any way since my departure. So to sum it up, and to be completely fair, I don't think you can beat this hotel for a night or two at the airport. The rooms are fantastic, and most people wouldn't be stuck there for as long as I was, so the food will probably suffice. But despite the cardboard smiles, I think the service and the housekeeping leaves way too much to be desired for me to give this hotel anything other than an average rating overall.

The bathroom is remodeled nicely as well. Flat screen TV features HD on some channels. Convenient location with free shuttle from DFW terminals with 5 minutes, or you can just walk across to Terminal C in a couple of minutes. Free parking, and the hotel validates the toll ticket required to access the airport. If you have a car, it is very convenient to access many shopping and dining areas within 15 minutes. Good service overall with the exception of just one annoying bellboy. Appealing outdoor pool. Cons: The gym is temporary at this point so it has two old treadmills, an old elliptical machine and two bikes. No weights except for a couple of medicine balls. They said it will eventually be better but perhaps still not much for weights. Wireless internet keeps disconnecting and costs $11 for 24 hours. Water pressure in the shower is low. Restaurants are extremely expensive. Coffee comes in a 3-cup pot minimum and costs $6, onion soup is $8, sushi rolls $8.50. Appetizers run $12 and up. Entrees $20 and up. Value: I stayed using a weekend AAA rate and it was $101 + tax. The normal weekend rate was $119 + tax.

Mr G's Restaurant in the hotel is an exception to every hotel rule. The food is absolutely superb, the service impeccable, the wine list absolutely first class.

In fact, we we in flight to Boston and had almost reached Pennsylvania when the captain announced that we had to turn around and head back to DFW. What a drag! We were worried that once we reached DFW at 6 PM, there would be no hotel rooms left because of all the stranded passengers. But the minute the plane landed, we were on the phone to the Hyatt. There were no rooms at the Grand Hyatt, but we did manage to book one of the last rooms available at the Hyatt Regency. We were fortunate to get one of the recently renovated rooms (so recently renovated that the 'new rug smell' was quite obvious) on the 11th floor. We had a double bed room to accomodate my husband, 14 year-old son and myself. The room was great---the beds very comfortable and the sheets divine. There was no bedspread on the beds, just a white duvet with a kind of useless runner on the bottom--nice design but totally funtionless. The room had a big screen TV, free WiFi, and a small balcony overlooking the airport. It was fun to watch the planes take off and land (although we wished we were on one of them!) and the noise was minimal. You could hear the planes slightly through the thickly paned windows but it was not a problem. The bathroom was adequate, dark but with nice amenities. I know it's not a PC-thing to say, but I really hate the quality of light that the new energy-efficient light bulbs give off; it's more like a flourescent light quality---cold, blue and unwelcoming. The Hyatt uses these bulbs liberally throughout the room. The TV was great, except the movie we were watching quit just before the ending, due to a failure in the central system. Bummer, but they did not charge us for the rental (expensive at $13.99 per movie). The lobby of the hotel was beautiful, and the staff was accomodating and efficient. I really appreciated the cafe/concessions stand near the restaurants. You could get a quick something to eat or coffee with minimal hassle. We ate in the bar (which had a lot of energy due to all the hapless passengers caught in the storm) after seeing the restaurant's prices. Very high, but an innovative menu. We ordered Nachos (recommended), a Rueben (fine), and the onion soup (highly recommended). The margueritas were great; the wine was a skimpy pour. The ease of getting to the airport, the excellent staff and accomodations, make this an excellent choice of hotels if you are stuck at the DFW airport. Call early as it tends to fill up. I asked one of the desk managers what the difference was between this Hyatt Regency and the other Hyatt at the airport and she said, \"Only the spa and the prices are higher at the other Hyatt.\" Since this Hyatt is newly renovated, and if you don't need a spa, this Hyatt might be a more economical choice. We paid $159/ night which I think was high, because they were capitialzing on the situation, so I imagine at other times, the cost would be lower. Recommedation: Eat at the bar, get a window facing the airport to watch the planes landing and taking off, check quoted pricing; have fun!", "Date": "March 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat One-Nighter!\u201d", "Author": "BoysInNY", "ReviewID": "UR6335828", "Content": "This hotel surprised me! The exterior looks old and dated, but once inside it's a very modern-style hotel! The check-in staff was great, and the beds were EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE!

If you have friends that drive in to meet you, remember to have their parking ticket validated by the concierge to avoid paying the parking fee. If you have a quick overnight layover at DFW, this is a great place to stay. There are airport monitors by the elevators that can track your flight, and it's only a short walk to Concourse C where you can check in for any American Airlines flight, or take the free green shuttle bus called Terminal Link to get to any of the other four terminals.", "Date": "December 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cNo issues\u201d", "Author": "Gurnip", "ReviewID": "UR5537356", "Content": "Stayed here on an overnight passing through Dallas, arrived late - 9pm.

Unfortuanately the both meals were cold on arrival - faulty microwave? : ) Sent them back, same meals returned 10 minutes later 'nuked' - not stylish - advised that we were still not happy, and the manager took the meals and the two drinks off the bill, and offerered a free take away pizza.
