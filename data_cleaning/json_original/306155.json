It is, in fact, a great location with lots of shopping options (Bugis Junction, Bugis Village, technology malls, Little India), great food courts, and it's close to the MRT (not one block like one previous poster said, but 5 blocks to Little India, 6 to Bugis -- still only 10 minutes). But the price is high and the rooms are extremely small -- more like Hong Kong. We felt very claustrophobic in the room after some of the rooms we had in the rest of Asia for much less. Even the old New 7th Storey Hotel (now sadly gone) had bigger rooms. Having said that, however, the room did have free wifi and a tub with a proper shower. The room was fairly quiet. There was very little street noise, but our AC unit was quite loud, even on the lowest setting, and the overhead fan looked like it was about to fall off the ceiling. Staff were great, both at the front desk, the main door and in the restaurant. The buffet breakfast was good with fresh fruit, cereal, Chinese offerings, and an option for freshly made omelettes. But it wasn't the best: the fruit selection was limited, the \"yoghurt\" turned out to be some kind of pudding, and the hash brown potatoes were the reconstituted kind. I also do not like seeing omelettes made from an egg mixture sitting in a bowl for who knows how long. Much better to order fried eggs that come from a freshly cracked egg. But this is a common practice at a lot of buffet breakfasts. The breakfast room is also very small for the number of rooms in the hotel and can be quite crowded.

Andy and I booked a \"Courtyard Executive Double\" online. It wasn't what we expected. We found ourselves in a tired, dark & musty smelling, ground floor room, which was dominated by a great lump of ancient cathode ray TV, at the foot of the bed.

Pick up the key to room 105 and check it out. Would you be happy paying around 250 dollars a night for this? Right, now put your swimming trunks on and venture out to the hotel's outdoor jacuzzi (a few steps from room 105). Tucked away in a quiet corner, as it is, this used to be a tranquil little haven. A quiet area in which to chill out with a cool drink, whilst gazing upwards at the stars. Not any more. A flat, twin skinned, polycarbonate roof has been constructed above the jacuzzi. Water has become trapped between the skins, creating a perfect growing medium for the moulds etc that flourish there.

I booked our \"Courtyard Executive Double\" online. After checking in we were escorted to a first floor double room overlooking the road. Certainly not what we'd expected! A few minutes spent with the ever courteous reception staff produced the desired result... we were relocated to a \"Club\" room in the newer building across the courtyard in front of the main hotel building. Now, I'd always believed the rooms & suites in the newer building to be described as \"Courtyard\", when booking, but it seems I was wrong... they're called \"Club\" & there's a vast difference in the quality of what you'll get should you book one but find yourself in the other. (please see my next review of the hotel, written after we'd stayed there for one night, two weeks after this stay. I hope that makes sense? :-) ) Anyway, our Club room was tastefully furnished & there were copious amounts of hot water (always nice to find). Bath robes & slippers too. Nice! The buffet breakfast was good. It always is. But a tip... try to book a room with breakfast included in the price, otherwise it will set you back an extortionate tenner or more per person! We enjoyed our two night stay & when Marcia and I checked out, before flying on for a twelve day tour of Cambodia, we were already looking forward to returning to the Albert Court for a one night stopover on our way back to England.

I made a terrible mistake of staying at this hotel for my honeymoon, the staff at the reception was very rude and unwelcoming. After traveling for a non stop 16 hours I consider myself very unfortunate to run into a very rude lady (I forgot her name.) at the reception desk with whom after having an argument over the security deposit for the mini bar and other amenities, during which she literally threatened me that \"I will cut your phone!\". Seeing my wife very tired I just wanted to get a room ASAP, so I submitted to her conditions. Earlier I had made an early check in request through my travel agent considering the length of my travel reaching Singapore, even then I was asked to wait in hotel lobby for more then 3 hours. I had booked a deluxe room after reading the reviews about base category rooms being small, still I was given a very small room in the corner part of the hotel. I took some rest and again went back to same lady at the reception and asked for different room and the reply a came we don't have any more rooms available, I asked for her manager, only then she very cleverly took me to a room right below the room I was staying in and showed me that all rooms are like this only. I told her It\u2019s the same room just on a different floor, I want another room. Then again she brought me back to reception checked for another room (mumbling somethings in Chinese to her colleague, which were definitely not good wishes for me.) and showed me a bigger room. Now I understood that after asking for her manager she showed me 2 rooms and earlier when I had asked her politely, she simply refused and even when so many rooms were available I was made to wait for more then 3 hours and given a small room. This shows how you might be tricked at Albert Court Village. While staying there for 3 nights I spoke to another staff about the same lady and came to know that there has been already many complaints against her. I would like the manager to kindly speak to her, things like vacations and honeymoon leaves memories and mine unfortunately wasn't a very good one. P.S.

The hotel is just outside of Little India MRT and within walking distance of Bugis market ..Lots of reasonable eating places nearby , 7-11's at both entrances..Clean linen ,changed daily ,ample toiletries changed daily..Very nice staff ,both in behavior and fast responsive action.

In July 2011 we stayed at the Albert Court Village Hotel. We stay there every year to celebrate our daughter\u2019s birthday. Before I give my feedback today I have to honestly say that all of our 4 previous stays at the Albert Court Village Hotel have been great but this was because we stayed in the courtyard rooms opposite the main building. Before I write about my negative experiences I would like to tell you that the Hotel does have some good sides but not many- actually only one and that is that the hotel entrance is clean, modern and lovely. Our daughter arrived one day before us. The room allotted to her was close to the restaurant and close to the elevators. Room was so small that when we arrived and the staff delivered a rollaway bed for her the room was so tiny you could hardly move. In fact the staff could hardly get the bed into the room. After one night on this bed we asked for a replacement knowing from our previous stays that they have bigger rooms. We were told that we will be given an upgrade. We were then moved to the same floor room but to rooms of the opposite side of the elevators. When we saw the upgraded room we were very tempted to go back to the desk and ask for a downgrade to the previous room. We were shocked. This \u201cupgrade\u201d ruined our stay in Singapore. The room didn't appear to have had any maintenance or decoration done for years. It was filthy with a lingering smell of dampness. It was the kind of filth and smell you see and feel when you close a house and come back to it years later. It was very evident that the room hadn't been cleaned for very long. The carpet was very dirty and had stains. The room\u2019s walls and ceiling were dirty as well and the paint had turned from white to light brown. The room's windows were filthy as well. Not to mention the curtains, well if you can call them that. They were one big, dirty piece of some sort of fabric hanging down from a rod. The bar fridge was dirty, mouldy and empty. There was an old TV unit. When we accidentally moved one of the beds there was leftover food, one shoe, an empty drink can, small plastic bottle, used tissues, various remnants of previous occupants as well as a dead cockroach. How gross and disgusting it that?!! The furniture in the room was also old. The bedside lamp was attached to the wall but not covering the previous hole in the wall. Basically the whole room was worn out and far from being luxurious like the images shown on hotel\u2019s website or the one\u2019s we remembered from our previous stays. The bathroom was dirty, smelly, mouldy and with hairs in the bath tub. The grouting between the bathroom\u2019s tiles was probably fresh once. Perhaps when they built the building? There was mildew was all around the tiles, the walls and the ceiling. Actually I will stop there on the bathroom because, well to be honest, the least said about the bathroom the better. It was the worst bathroom I\u2019ve ever seen in my whole life and I travel very often. The entire floor we stayed on looked really old and run down. Different pieces of carpet, which were also filthy and stained, were joined together in the corridor like a patchwork quilt. Dead cockroach sightings were a daily occurrence. The next shock was the unavailability of internet. No free internet, not even in the lobby. Of course, it was offered but the price was enormous. Who in the world is going to pay tens of SG$ a day? Or over SG$ 2 for 15 min (using hotel\u2019s computer) when the internet else were so much cheaper? I\u2019m really surprised that a hotel like this still exists in Singapore considering it was never like this before. It\u2019s a pity. The Albert Court Village Hotel is definitely not like many people here are describing. It is not a perfect boutique hotel either. Stay away from it. We used to stay here every year and next year we will be staying somewhere else! Just to finish up, prior to arriving we exchanged a few emails with the hotel in regard to a rollaway bed for our daughter. A reply to our e-mail confirmed the request and the price was quoted at SGD 50 per night. We had the lovely surprise of seeing SGD 60 plus 10% government fee on our bill for each night for the bed when we checked out. The receptionist was not even interested to listen to our explanation. I have never ever experience such attitude from a hotel receptionist anywhere. In conclusion I do NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. Value for money? \u2026 not at all. It's overpriced for what you get!

It was a corner room which was very small and didn't appear to have had any maintainence or decoration done on it for years. There was a little old TV sitting on a corner cupboard that took up valuable room space, the chair for the dressing table had a fabric seat that was so filthy that we asked for a replacement as soon as we got there, it was replaced with one that was not much better. The electric socket under the desk didn't work and we had to boil the kettle sitting it on the floor near the bathroom door..... the bathroom, yes well the least said about that the better....roomy yes, basin in granite top very roomy, but the bath....well I don't think they knew what clean fresh grouting meant. dirt & meldew all around the tiles. The shower didn't work properly. The worst bathroom from our month long trip. Good job we were only there 4 nights at the end of our holiday. The only decent thing in the room was the bed, although it was actually a queen sized when it was advertised as a king size. The hotel approach is lovely and entrance is clean and modern.

Will never go there again\u201d", "Author": "nmerchant", "ReviewID": "UR112675532", "Content": "We stayed at Albert Court Village Hotel from 3rd - 8th June and we had a really bad experience. We were a family of three who were about to have our Singapore trip ruined. For starters, when we entered the hotel, all the woman at the reception did was offer me a quizzical look. No good morning. No sort of greeting whatsoever. But i decided to let that go and showed her my reservation. Little did I know that things were about to get a lot worse!! When we checked into the room, the room was FILTHY and smelt like chlorine from a swimming pool. Some bed sheets were tucked in, some were not. There were LAYERS of dust on the fan and several pieces of furniture. It's the kind of dust you see when you close a house for a year and come back. It was very evident that some parts of the room hadn't been cleaned for MONTHS. The dirty parts of the room included: 1) The fan. FILTHY 2) Edges of furniture 3) Surfaces of the paintings on the walls. 4) Bathroom door 5) Space under bed: There was LEFT OVER FOOD on the floor!!!!! Yuck!!!! Whoever cleaned the room did the worst job possible. When we looked at the AC vent, we saw WATER. Yes, the AC was dripping water onto the carpet. The smell of Chlorine was so awful that we had to ask for a room change, but the hotel refused. They said that the hotel was full and instead they offered to have to room totally cleaned when we went out for lunch. We left and came back after 3 hours and surprise surprise, everything was EXACTLY THE SAME. We complained again and finally the housekeeping manager came and oversaw the cleaning process. We were also very irritated about the fact that half the staff don't know english. This is the procedure I had to go through to ask for a simple bowl to be delivered to my room: 1) Called housekeeping. They said (in broken english) \"Call restaurant\" 2) Called restaurant, they asked me to call housekeeping on a different number. 3) Called housekeeping. Told them to get me an empty bowl. The reply i get - \"You want salt?\" followed by \"Soogar?\" All this time I kept saying \"No I want an EMPTY BOWL\". Finally they say \"Bowl? We dont have something called bowl.\" WTF???!!!! How can housekeeping not have something called a bowl??? 4) Finally I had to call the reception and tell them to make their colleagues understand that I want a bowl. By now 15 minutes have passed since I originally wanted a bowl. 10 minutes later, I finally got what I want. I felt like I had won a war. The technician came and cleaned the AC. He said that the AC was clogged with dirt from the inside and so water was dripping (YUCK!!!!!) He managed to solve the problem though. We were staying on the 2nd floor and the entire floor looked really old and run down. The carpets had stains on them, the ceiling had cracks and had turned from white to light brownish. A lot of renovation is overdue. The next rude shock was the unavailability of internet. I had previously stayed in Kuala Lumpur and Bali before I came to Singapore and everywhere, we had got complementary internet. But not out here. Who in the world is going to pay SGD $26 a day for WiFi???? That's insane. There was an internet cafe in Little India that chared SG $1 per hour. Rather go there. Being an Indian (and vegetarian), the only thing that worked in the hotel's favour was its proximity to Little India. Food was not a problem outside the hotel and the MRT station was 10 minutes walking distance. To conclude, I would like to reiterate that the hotel is not worth visiting and I do NOT recommend this hotel to ANYONE. The receptionists need to smile, the housekeeping don't know english, the hotel is run down, our room was filthy, the AC leaked and the hotel cost too much for such rubbish service. I stayed at the Legend Hotel in Kuala Lumpur in 5 star luxury at HALF THE PRICE i paid for Albert Court Village.

One word about the reception staff though --- they should be a little bit more relaxed and smiling as people coming in are arriving generally after a longish flight and they would love to see someone friendly at the reception.

Little India on one side , Bugis Village on the other, theres so much to do around here.I regret I got to spend only nights at the hotel, since i was on a business trip and stayed away most of the day. Starting with a smooth check in, the hotel is ready to accommodate you with an early check in if rooms are available and do not wish to keep you waiting at all. There cannot be anything more convenient than a bed and breakfast booking as no one wants to go hunting early in the morning for as much as a bread to nibble on.The breakfast at the hotel has a good local and continental choice and is filling .The guy who welcomes you at the breakfast room says hello in several tongues and has a cheerful face to begin your day with.The rooms are very very spacious and have all the amenities, a mini bar, a nice study table, Tv with cable and comfortable beds. There is an open courtyard with benches outside the front door and is a great place to just relax and chat with family and friends on a breezy evening. Little India and all the cultural attractions it comes with is just a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Bugis village and all the shopping it comes with is just another 5 mins ont he other side. Bugis metro station is about a 7 minute walk and not too bad a walk at all. There are several other restaurants beside the open courtyard at the hotel.Western food, Italian, and Indian being a few. My vote goes to the great food and ambience at the Indian place. Walk a few steps on one side or the other to pick up some great local food at the food court.If Burger king is more your kind of choice, thats there too .

Many of the staff verged on rude, asking them anything was interfering in their day.

New rule: don't stay in any place that ranks less than 50 in any major city. We were unlucky enough to book a \"Standard\" room on the high-rise side of the place. It was terrible: small, noisy and a carpet covered in black stains. What have people been doing to them? Air conditioning was on its last legs and we asked to be moved. The new room was equally as bad and the air conditioning was also faulty. So after you've had a gut-full of the standard rooms, you will complain enough to be \"upgraded\" to the \"other\" Albert Court Hotel which consists of a couple of charming-looking pre-war 2-story wings. For those of you who have only stayed in the \"executive rooms\" at the Albert Court I am very keen to hear how well you slept. I have never stayed in a place in which my sleep was disturbed so much. Let me explain: Sound insulation is so poor on the executive wings that if somebody was to close their cupboard 4 rooms down the corridor, you would hear a loud bang. It beggars belief how little thought as gone into providing general quietness: All bedroom doors close with a loud bang, as do the cupboards and fire doors which seem to be frequently used by the staff who are oblivious to the problem. The place has obviously had a cheap refit and they've put up wafer-thin partitions to separate the rooms with zero noise-dampening on any of the doors or cupboards. Coupled to this is the positioning of a communal lounge area that backs straight on to the windows of about 8 rooms. Anyone wishing to get some sleep while the lounge area is occupied better get some high grade ear plugs. So this is a request to the management for the benefit of your guests of the future: At the very least, please invest in some acoustic dampening for all doors and cupboards.

The king size bed was extremely comfortable and the bedding was clean and luxurious. Two pillows were provided per person. Toiletries were provided in the bathroom (body lotion, shower gel, shampoo, razor kit, soap, toothbrush and paste, razor kit and shower cap) and fresh towels every day. Hot water always available. Guests of executive rooms have their own lobby (accessed by your room key) where free tea/coffee/milo and biscuits are available.

We set it to 28 degrees (the highest) but the air con was still on for 95% of the time. That, and the fridge, were my only gripes with this otherwise brilliant hotel.

There are a couple of reasons for choosing this hotel: 1) spacious rooms - around 25 to 28 sq m if I remember it correctly. One can do a full cartwheel inside, & it easily fits the four of us even w/an extra bed; 2) considering the size of the rooms, it's reasonably priced, unlike same-prized hotels which tend to have small rooms (some only measuring 15 sq m or even less, especially the boutique ones; 3) the MTR and bus station are just a good two-minute walk, or five, depending on your pace; & 4) it's near Mustafa Center, a souvenir haven (plus the exchange rates offered at Mustafa is competitive). When we got to the hotel, we fell in love with it's quaint, quiet charm. There's a courtyard, indeed, but it was under renovation at the time. However, it did not deter us from getting our pics taken at the courtyard. Also, we were quite surprised to discover that just across the hotel, there's an open-air eatery serving local food (indian, chinese) for a cheap price. There's also a nearby 7-11, the same way going to Mustafa Center. It was also Deepavali so the streets were adorned appropriately. Inside the hotel, a lemon grass fragrance would greet guests, which might not be appreciated by some, but in my opinion, it works wonderfully. As for the staff, well, they just let us wander around, and do what we want. I know there's an escalator and our room was only on the second (or third?) floor, we're young and able-bodied, and there's not much to carry, but still, I was disappointed that the staff did not ask us whether we'd like a porter. Not that they're rude because I really didn't have a problem with the staff. Their chill attitude towards the guests complements my laid-back personality. So, let's just say the staff let us do as we please, without any intervention. Did I already say that the neighborhood is quiet? That is a plus if you want to sleep unhampered. But, if your main reason for staying in Singapore is to shop, the hotels at or near Orchard Road will better suit your needs. Will I return to Albert Court again?

Also the bathroom was very well stocked with anything i might have needed, and the power shower was wonderful! The first real hot shower i'd had since leaving London 2 weeks earlier. The view out of both windows was non-existent (a block of flats out of one, and a tiny courtyard out of the other) but they were at the far end of the room and didn't make any difference to the aesthetic.

Slept better than at any hotel i've stayed at yet, and checked out by 12 the next day.

Both these rooms were stinking and had bugs. When we complained we were given one executive room (1230) late in the night and second room continued to be same stinking room (611). First of all we fail to understand that how an executive room got available in the evening from thin air? Secondly we had paid for Executive rooms so who will compensate for the differential and hardships that we had to undergo? Executive room was good enough but they gave it in the evening and by that time they had spoilt our mood and trip. Besides the staff at the reception was very rude and made us feel that they were doing us a favour by giving us substandard rooms when we had paid and confirmed Executive room.

I was very disappointed with the whole experince. We arrived at the hotel at 3am and were checked into a garden room. This was on the ground floor and to be honest at that early hour we were just glad to get to bed. On arrival into the hotel there was a really damp fusty smell and this was echoed in our room. The next morning we had breakfast in the very small dining room. The service was mediocre and the food was very basic - all self service. We went out on the city tour which took us only to the tourist places as you would expect but for us it was not worth it as we didn't really enjoy it. We thought we would get an overview of the city but instead we were taken to the main tourist sites including a gem factory where you were expected to part with your money!!. The tour never even included or mentioned Orchard road the famous shopping street. Whe we got back from the tour we had time to see what the room was actually like. Since we were staying at the hotel for 3 more nights it was apparent to me that I couldn't stay in the garden room as it was damp, dark and small. The clothes we had left out smelled damp when we got back to the room. It was just not what we had expected. We had travelled via Dubai, New Zealand , Australia and this stop was to be the culmination of our 8 week trip and should have ended on a high. I approached the receptionist and asked if there was an alternative to the room we had been allocated. I was shown two rooms which were available and we agreed to move to the second floor. This room was much airier and lighter and the damp smell and astmosphere had disappeared. All was reasonably OK until the next morning when I noticed my pillow. I looked more closely at the actual pillow cover as it looked grey. When I removed the pillowcase the pillow and internal cover were filthy. I then proceeded to check all the pillows and they were all in the same condition. They looked as though they hadn't been changed for months. These pillow covers are disposable I use them at home! For something as intimate as pillows you would think the covers would be clean and disposed of after each guest. I asked at reception to speak to someone about the standard of cleanliness and he immediately requested the housekeeper to come and see what the problem was. Half an hour later no one had arrived so my husband went to reception again. Apparently the receptionist was cross that no one had been to see us about the problem. He requested the attention again and after a few minutes she came to our room. She asked what the problem was and I pointed to the bed with the array of pillows and covers. She looked at them and appeared to be horrified at the condition of them. She immediately picked them up and said ;OK, I wash them for you'. My response was 'no, I want them all replacing with clean new pillows, covers and pillow cases' She picked them all up and off she went. When we returned there had been a complete change of pillows and their respective linen. The issues of the damp smell and atmosphere, dirty pillows and linen and the general ambience of the hotel was extremely disappointing but the final straw came the next morning at breakfast. The hotel is situated across from Little India (an appallingly dirty place - we have been to India and that country is far cleaner than Little India in Singapore) You would not wish to eat there if you had any respect for your digestive system. As a result there are many Indian Tour operators using the hotel for their clientele. These tours were in large numbers and at 8.30am the dining room was full and there was a very long queue of approximately 20 people. We had to wait to be seated and that was only possible when a table was vacated. This happened on two more occassions at breakfast. We didn't eat at the hotel any other time.

We had wanted to be in the Orchard Road area but, tired of shelling out for two rooms in expensive hotels, we chose instead this time a less costly option out of our area of choice. The Albert Court and environs were unattractice from the get go. The hotel is a mess of badly incorporated modern additions onto an historic Singaporean building. Neither styles work now. The front side faces an architectural monstrosity and there is a main road at the back. The squeaking, dying rat by the potted plant at the entrance was offputting. We were assigned two rooms on a smoking floor (who even has smoking floors these days?) despite the fact that I had booked many weeks in advance and was travelling with children. We spent an hour at reception trying to be relocated. Staff attempted to be helpful but the choices were few it seemed and our new rooms, on a 'non smoking' floor, smelled worse than the first. Anyway too tired to pursue the issue further we put up with it. Apart from that the rooms were adequate and quiet. Little India itself turned out to be pretty good with more old Singaporean culture and less shopping malls than Orchard Rd. It was good to experience a bit of both. Good eating, small shops and markets. The nearest metro station was a short walk away and train was the easiest way to travel. Orchard Road took about 10 minutes stop to stop. Taxis just seemed to sit in traffic jams. I would recommend Little India as a location but The Albert Court is ordinary.

LOCATION We had a 3-night stop over in Singapore and chose the Albert Court Hotel for our short stay. The taxi ride from the airport was around 20 minutes and cost 18 SGD day time and 27 SGD at night time. I would say that the hotel is in a good location (on the edge of Little India but other side of the canal) but still a good 25-minute walk into the city but I guess it depends on where you want to go and what you want to visit. The hotel is a 5-minute walk away from Little India Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) which is an excellent way of getting around in Singapore. There is also a hop-on-hop-off tour bus which stops at the corner of Little India. 2. HOTEL The hotel has an impressive, clean reception area with a couple of computers on which you can browse the internet or check emails at a small fee. On arrival we were allocated a room facing the non-stop Rochor Canal Road but the receptionist was happy to move us upon our request to Room 329 which was facing the quiet court yard. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. While the bathroom was VERY clean, it would require a bit of modernisation (please see image). If this is your first trip you are planning to Singapore, you might be interested to know that Singapore is one of the cleanest countries in the world so you will see cleaners constantly mopping floors around hotels and basically everywhere\u2026 apart from in Little India. We did not have any breakfast or dinner at the hotel so I am unable to comment on the meal quality. One bad point I would like to mention is that I have paid postal fee for a few postcards at the reception and they offered to post them for me but interestingly \u2013 none of the postcards have reached their destination! It is very frustrating as I was planning to send cards to our family from each country we visited during our 6-week trip and all the others have arrived safely which I posted myself. 3. TIPS & RECOMMENDATIONS 3.1. GETTING AROUND If you are staying a little bit out of town, it\u2019s well worth getting the MRT into the city or to the Harbour Front. Again, it's extremely clean (no graffiti or dirt can be seen) and it\u2019s very cheap too \u2013 approx 2 SGD but you\u2019ll get 1 SGD back when you return your plastic swipe card at each destination. 3.2. THINGS TO DO * Jurong Bird Park \u2013 amazing place\u2026 bird show, Lory loft (hand-feed parrots with nectar), biggest man-made water fall, world\u2019s largest walk-in aviary, birds of pray show\u2026 etc etc\u2026 * Raffles Hotel \u2013 it\u2019s worth a short visit but try to avoid the famous Singapore Sling (we couldn\u2019t and paid 47 SGD for two). You can get this cocktail in some other bars (tasting the same as we experienced it) for a lot less. * Sentosa Island \u2013 get the cable car from the Harbour Front across to the small island for amazing views\u2026 Don\u2019t miss the Nature Walk, 4D Magix & Cineworld. Songs of the Sea night time show offers an amazing water-fire-laser show with some music (2 performances per night: 7:40pm & 8:40pm). * Speaking to a few locals, they also recommended the zoo but we didn\u2019t make it\u2026 3.3. EATING OUT We headed for the \u201cfamous\u201d Clarke Quay river front to eat which is basically a row of restaurants\u2026 We felt very pressured with staff trying to get us eat in their restaurant rather than leaving us browsing the outdoor menus in peace\u2026 We didn\u2019t like that to be honest. 4. OVERALL EXPERIENCE The hotel is a 3-star accommodation and lives up to its standards but I would possibly pick a hotel in the city centre or on Sentosa Island next time I visit Singapore.

It proved quite interesting as an illustration of how experiences can vary, and hence how one often finds quite different opinions on a hotel. On our first visit, I was impressed by the lobby and the way that a modern hotel had been crafted from historic shophouses. The staff were smartly dressed, pleasant and efficient; the room was better than I expected, on level 7 in a tower behind the main block. Access was via escalators to level 2 (numbering in Singapore is like the US - ground = 1) and then glass lifts on the outside of the building up to our floor, which was a bit of a surprise when we suddenly noticed you could see through the tinted glass walls. The room itself was slightly better than expected, in good condition, quite small but fairly tastefully decorated - although describing it as a 'boutique hotel' is pushing it a bit. The same lifts were to prove a great nuisance on our second visit. We were in Room 113 in the ground floor courtyard, right opposite an enormous set of louvers masking air handling plant or the lift motor room. The water features did little to conceal the noise. With the lifts being on the outside of the building right outiside our window, we could hear the electronic 'bing-bong' of the lifts as they stopped at every floor; with two lifts and quite a few rooms over quite a few floors this happened so often and so continually as to become quite maddening. They really need some better glazing - or to quieten or disable the lift bells. Other points on the second room - larger; better bathroom; smelled damp; big hole / burn in bed cover. Common points to both: breakfast quite good albeit not up to the standards of your best 4/5 star. Overall, quite good for the price, I think, but some of the rooms are not so good.

We had high expectations for the hotel and yet we were still pleasantly surprised when we finally arrived at the venue. The first thing you notice when you arrive via taxi is a wide courtyard which serves as a drop-off point for vehicles. The hotel's within the district of Little India where everything's a little tight so this courtyard is a pleasing sight. Upon entry, the lobby is not majestically grand but it's elegant in its own little ways. You will notice from this point that the hotel remains clean all throughout. Making our way to our room, again we were pleasantly surprised. The room had a distinct subtle British-India look and feel to it. The walls and carpets were clean while the room was well-lit with natural lighting. The hotel is right outside the heart of the Little India district, which is nice because you get to experience this distinct sub-culture of the whole Singapore community without actually being too immersed in its hustle and bussle. A five-minute walk across the street leads you to Little India MRT station which is one or two stations away form the Orchard Rd. shopping area as well as the Clarke Quay River Civic Center. The hotel's accessbility to and fro the MRT station is personally one of the hotel's strongest points. A hawker centre greets you just outside the MRT station so that's a treat as well! As a bonus, there's a Jacuzzi, Gym, and Steam Room on the hotel's ground floor free to use for guests. I've stayed in 3-star hotels in Europe and Manila and I must say very few have impressed me like Albert Court Hotel.
