If you stumble across the Mercure Paris Austerlitz you\u2019ve found a real gem. It\u2019s funky, cool, trendy, comfortable, clean, has modern TV, free internet (but unreliable), tea/coffee making facilities and a fridge. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Executive rooms are big for Paris, the standard rooms a good size, with funky designs and very comfortable beds. I\u2019ve stayed at this hotel a couple of times now and would stay again. I\u2019d only hesitate with choosing this hotel again if the Marriott was the same price. Getting to the hotel from Denfert Rocherau or Nation station or on metro line 6 if needed) could not be easier; the metro station is outside the front door. There is a supermarket opposite the hotel for provisions. There are a couple of places to eat at reasonable prices near to the hotel, or a 2 minute metro ride away.

Room is very nice, bed was very good, bathroom was fully equipped and very clean. Very quiet as the hotel is not located in the center of the city. Breakfast was very good, allthough not much space in the breakfast room. We went to get our breakfast at 8am, to get there before the rush. Very good restaurant next door (Lily and... ?). Free wifi internet is available. Staff is friendly, but not very up to date for tips and tricks to visit Paris. Security is always present, and luggage is kept locked away after check-out until you leave. Location is at the far outside of the center of Paris (quai de la gare), however, metro connections are very good (on average 10-15minutes from and to center Paris). For us, this was not a problem seen the fact that the room was cheaper than any (so called) 3* hotel next to the Tour Eiffel.

Wifi Internet available for free with a code. (I forget if there was a computer in the lobby, not sure) Unfortunately, the illusion of luxury is destroyed by its location because it becomes an odyssey to get to and fro the hotel. The metro stop is on a line that requires you to change no matter where you want to go in Paris. The bus routes aren't that helpful either. And there were vagrants outside which took the allure away from the place.

Check in was great, the staff speak English, so it wasn't a total drama trying to find our room when we are both not fluent French. Breakfast was brilliant, buffet style with a decent choice of hot food, cold cheeses and meats, breads, fruit and pastries. Check out was 11am and the hotel had the facilitiy to hold luggage for guests. We didn't use this, but stioll the option was available. The location was brilliant, right nect to the metro, a restaurant/bar 2 doors down where we ate on the first night, excellent food, even better desserts, try the tiramasu nutella or raspberry!! and good value for money.
