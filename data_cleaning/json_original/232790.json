Free WiFi (despite the frequent interuptions) was more than useful for Skype calls and remote access to mails. Room was equipped with a large 32'' Samsung LED TV from a strange viewing position and a kitchenette. I would prefer a kettler and a mug, instead of boiling water in a cacherole (BTW: I was given a cup from the restaraunt to use for my coffee and the cleaner took it away next day ...). A plus is that hotel is 100% NON-smoking. Breakfast was well below average in both quality and quantity. Because of the congress the hotel is on the pricey side, but the rate was normal the last day, for a 3stars/keys hotel. I have rated this hotel above average because of the very polite staff and the location which is close to Las Ramblas and literally within 30 meters (in the same building block) to the entrance of Drasanes metro station.

We booked 2 nights at the Gutenberg as part of a pre-cruise package through Cruise 1st. My first tip is check out the position of the Gutenberg on Google earth before you go and print out the map, the taxi drivers in Barcelona dont know where it is, this was mentioned by other reviewers on Trip Advisor and saved us a lot of hassle. It did not save us any money though beware the Barcelona taxi drivers, they think of a price and double it, check your taxi has a meter, that it is used and that you can view it, there is a surcharge for pick ups from the airport ( 2 or 3e)and 1e per bag too (if you get charged approx 30e from airport thats about right). Once you have found the hotel, which is tucked away but in a really great position for sight seeing in Barcelona, just off the main shopping and tourist area and near the port vell (worth a visit and easy walking distance)with more shopping, good eating and the large Barcelona Aquarium (good but pricey). The famous La Rambla is the next street to the hotel, where there are living statues, artists, flower sellers, a huge fruit market, and the smaller maze of shops that make up the Les Rambles are just on the other side of la Rambla. These streets are too narrow for vehicles and make up a labyrinth of small independant businesses, some touristy, some expensive and exclusive and quite a few trade only jewellery wholesalers, plus of course pavement cafes. Beware of the prices with these cafes, we paid 6 euros for a coffee you dont want to do that too often. There is a good \"carre fore\" supermarket in La Rambla we stocked up on iced coffee, croissonts, cheese and fruit from the fruit market (cheaper if you venture in than buying from the first stall). This was possible because our room in the Gutenberg contained a small but useful kitchen area, including a working fridge !! very useful we had Fruit and croissonts with ham and cheese for breakfast each day, in bed, yummy. Unfortunately no kettle but it was a God send to have the fridge (and a hot plate which we didn't use). the Gutenberg also have a cafe on site with quite reasonable prices but we only had drinks there. The Room- The rooms were a good size, we had a big wardrobe, a big bed (actually two put together), armchair, dressing table, chair, mini kitchette, Bathroom with small bath with shower over, basin, toilet, with space for toilettries, nice towels, red decor but it worked! The airconditioner did work well once we worked out how to use it, it has three settings off, on fan only and air con, the first night we had it on fan NOT air con (the light blue symbol is air con) but once we worked out what went wrong we were OK. There is also a safe in the room, a hair dryer, a TV but local channels only. Everything was clean and they were helpful, allowing us to drop our luggage in a secure area before we checked in as we had an early flight and arrived three hours before our room was ready. This wasn't luxury but it was good value for money and as we only intended it as a base for our two days in Barcelona before our cruise it was perfect (particularly for its position). Just a note on Barcelona- Barcelona is expensive, food, transport so expect to pay pay pay this is not a place to get a bargain. The Airport- Due to circumstances beyond our control we had to get to Barcelona airport 7 hours before our flight, but having checked in on-line we expected to drop our bags and have a meal and wander around the shops for 7 hours. No such luck! easy jet refused to allow us to bag drop, even though they have a \"Bag Drop\" desk they only use it as if it were a regular check in, so we waited on metal chairs for 4 hours, with nothing to entertain or amuse us except the company of other disgruntled Bag drop customers who like us had expected to leave their luggage and enjoy the airport. However after 4 hours and finally being allowed to check in (again) we found to our dismay that the new airport has many shop units but the majority are empty shells, there was nothing to do for the remaining 3 hours either, just slightly more comfortable seating. Note to easy jet- Get the concept of Bag Drop through to your staff in Barcelona !!!!!!!! Note to Barcelona Airport - get the airlines to understand Bag Drop thereby giving tourists early access to the retail units, encouraging travellers to buy things while they wait for their flights, the more time they spend on the \"secure\" side ,the more money they will spend and you can encourage businesses into those empty shops. After 4 hours in a cavernous and uncomfortable check in waiting area I didn't feel like giving anyone any more of my hard earned cash, but 7 hours in a shopping centre enviroment may well have seperated me and my cash, and we'd all have been happier.", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Utrecht, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, service was perfect!\u201d", "Author": "Kikimaniek", "ReviewID": "UR62472594", "Content": "I was suppose to go back to Holland when a vulcanic eruption extended my stay in Barcelona.

He also said he would have to think about whether or not to refund us the two nights we would not be staying there (we paid in advance through the website), although we gave notice the previous night that we would not be staying there. As of now (a week later), we have not received the refund.", "Date": "October 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "middlesbrough", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "traveller1074", "ReviewID": "UR20777885", "Content": "Just returned from a weekend break for my friends 50th birthday. There was 8 men in 1 double and 2 triple rooms. We all agreed that the Hotel was in a perfect location and it was a very good Hotel. The staff on the desk were very friendly, helpful and spoke good english. The Hotel had the feel of a family run Hotel as opposed to a corporate Hotel. Breakfast was served in a pleasant room and was quite adequate for us. I agree with some previous reviews, the surrounding streets can be a little intimidating at night, best to approach from main road and a quick left into reception, but I must say, we did not encounter any problems and we used the side streets to get to Hotel. The Ramblas is a 2 minute walk away and the marina is just 5 minutes away. All of us would stay at this Hotel without hesitation, again.", "Date": "October 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tangier", "Title": "\u201cexcellent location, and very friendly receptionist!\u201d", "Author": "Todiscover", "ReviewID": "UR15268667", "Content": "I stayed in Gutenberg aparthotel Barcelona for 5 nights, from 19 to 25 December i think, and I loved the place! If you like simple, warm and clean places where u have all what u need, u'll love this hotel! Our first impression was great thanks to the friendly receptionist who spoke some arabic words! The streets in Barcelona were very cold, and when we get in the room, my friend and I were surprised, it was soooo waaaarm!! the room was very clean, with 2 twin confortable beds. there was a \"cupboard\", but when we opened it we realized that it was a kitchen actually,lol (stupid country girls!!) there was all what you need to cook and eat in your room, there was a small fridge as well the bathroom was very simple but clean but what is amazing in this hotel is the location, it's in \"las Ramblas\"!! u can have fun all the time, do shopping, go to the passeo Maritimo, all this 5 to 20minutes walking from the hotel also there is a metro station (green line) 2 minutes walk from the hotel It's a cosy place when u can feel home! there is a Carrefour market about 10 minutes walk from the hotel, and also a popular market where u can buy a delicious fruit juce, and a lot of chocolate!! to go to Plaza Catalonia, Parallel, Gaudi museum, it will take 20min to 30min walk, or u can take the Metro (the green line), it will take u even to the Camp Nou (Reina Christina station)", "Date": "April 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North York Moors National Park, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood customer service.\u201d", "Author": "ditsydaisy2010", "ReviewID": "UR14815260", "Content": "Two couples travelling, we arrived at Hotel at 6pm Saturday evening (day before Barcelona Marathon) and found that the website we booked through had cancelled our booking. The staff were very helpful even though they said they couldn't accommodate us in the two twin rooms which we had originally booked. They offered us a quad room on the top floor for the first night which was very spacious and modern and much better than we had hoped. The next day our friends were offered a twin room and we were allowed to stay for the rest of the trip in the quad room. The hotel is clean, central and close to La Ramblas and we didn't feel threatened when returning to the Hotel late at night ,despite it being near the so called red light district. A buffet breakfast was included in the price which had a very good variety to choose from and set us up for the day. Would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "April 5, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Gutenberg Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d232790-Reviews-Gutenberg_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$125 - $194*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Passatge Gutenberg, 7</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08001</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "232790", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/f7/ec/64/edificio.jpg"}}
