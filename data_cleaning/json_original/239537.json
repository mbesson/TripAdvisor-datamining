I arrived mid afternoon and was given a single room in the main building. After negotiating a very dodgy elevator, i arrived at my small single room. The initial reaction was the God awful smell of the room. The room itself was very dated with a single table and chair that looked like they had been dragged from the nearest antique shop. There was a small tv, but no remote control to be able to use it. I didn't intend using the tv that day, so didn't pursue it with the front desk. I did ask for the remote the following day, which the front desk gave. Unfortunately, they didn't bother to give any batteries at which point i gave up. The bathroom itself was in much better shape than the main part of the room, although the area for showering in was really small. The water was hot throughout the stay, but i only had ONE set of towels for the entire 5 nights ! The bed itself was absolutely fine, although again i was only given one set of sheets for the entire 5 night stay. The most irritating thing of all was the noise. The \"hotel\" gave me a room facing the main road, and despite being on the 3rd floor you could hear everything below from the continuous 24/7 traffic, people talking and shouting, the church bells, EVERYTHING. I would say without a shadow of a doubt this is the noisiest place i've ever stayed in. If you have trouble sleeping then insist on a room away from the main road. The only saving grace for the hotel was the location itself and the reasonable price compared to other Barcelona \"hotels\". If i had a choice again though i'd pay more to find somewhere else, and i'd use this place as a last resort.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cTiny room but worth it for location and price\u201d", "Author": "Cohunagirl", "ReviewID": "UR116877741", "Content": "Very tiny cramped room and the smallest bathroom I've ever seen, but the location was brilliant and you get what you pay for.

I believe this room would be beneficial in the Summer months, as there is no air conditioning but as it was October I was sorry I had not requested a brighter room at the front. The ensuite double room was very plain (hostel like) with hostel like beds,but very clean. There was a t.v but it was not working (this did not bother us as we had not come to watch t.v). There was no coffee/tea making facilities in room and a small fridge would have been very useful. There was plenty of room for one!!! The walls are very thin so you can hear a pin drop. We found staff to be helpful considering we did not have much Spanish . What makes this hotel is the location. It is a 5 minute stroll to Las Ramblas and is also right beside The Cathedral ,Town Hall, tourist office,and a metro station and it's lots of fun exploring the little streets in the Gothic Quarter .Lots of coffee shops,bars,shops etc right on your doorstep. There is a great atmosphere on this street and it is a safe area. If you are on a budget and just want somewhere to lay your head then this is the place to go.
