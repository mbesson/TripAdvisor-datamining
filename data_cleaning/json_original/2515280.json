The Mercure is a tiny hotel with no more than 20 rooms. It is quite elegantly decorated, especially compared to other Mercure properties. I was surprised by the room size which was rather large by Paris and Mercure hotels standards, maybe because the hotel is officially a 4-star hotel. It offers standard amenities for a hotel of that category. The bathroom is also unusually large and well decorated with white and blue tiles and a slight retro touch. Staff was very helpful and serviceable. I was allowed to stay in the room after the official check-out time at no charge. Breakfast is served in a small room on the -1 floor where you access by a nice stone-walled stair. Here again service was very friendly. Because I spent some time reading a newspaper and my coffee got cold I was spontaneously offered another one. This is the kind of attention you appreciate in a hotel in France. Breakfast selection is large but newspaper selection is not large enough with business and English newspapers missing. However, there is a major downside in the hotel. I could not use my cell phone in the room as the connection was extremely poor. I mentioned the issue to the hotel manager thinking it was due to the room location. I was told that unfortunately the situation was the same not only in the whole hotel but also in the street. As I was traveling for business with many calls to place it was quite annoying.

The restaurants around the corner are fabulous (as stated in another review) and we ate there on several occasions. Within walking distance to lots of sights (even with a small child).

It was even better than I dared to hope (based on the reviews here, I had high hopes..). I stayed with a friend and we had booked a twin room. On arrival we were upgraded to a \"chambre privilig\u00e9\" (suite), and it was huge by Paris standards (and large even by usual standards..). The suite was on the 1 floor and facing a sort of encapsulated little \"garden\" (sorry.. can`t find a better word..) It was very quiet, no traffic noise or anything. The hotel is small, only 20 rooms, and although it was fully booked, it was nice and quiet. A clean and good bathroom with good bath salts, body lotion etc. and bath robes. The staff was friendly and very service- minded. One of the night portiers even found a recommended maroccan restaurant for us and showed us on the map. They spoke excellent English and were very polite. The hotel is perfectly located in a quiet street close to the posh Place Vendome and the Opera. Many good restaurants in the neighborhood and within easy walking distance to the Louvre and other sites. The only \"problem\" is that the nearest metro stations (Pyramides and Opera) are not served by the RER B (local trains) that takes you to and from the airports. That means that you have to change lines, and if you have a lot/ heavy luggage it can be a little strenuous to get to and from. I am told there is a bus that goes directly from CGD to Opera, though. I didn`t try that. There is no luggage storage room, so I would`t recommend leaving any valuables in your luggage after check-out. I left my bag there, but I locked it. The staff put it in the bar area. I collected it safely some hours later. I have stayed in Paris many times, but this is one of the best hotels I`ve stayed in so far.

With my wife we stayed at Mercure for 3 nights last Monday 23rd through Thursday 26 of March. Service was as expected for the Mercure hotels, but when we left our luggage -2cases, 1 bag and 1 backpack- at the hotel for the day, on Thursday 26th, at some point from 12:30 to 5:30PM, our backpack was searched, and our document holder \u2013it was in the backpack- opened and searched also. All our money (900Euros, 200USD and even 40 Argentina pesos equivalent to 13USD) was stolen. The documents were left in the same spot; it looked as if someone had the time to search through things in order not to generate a direct suspicion. When we claimed the luggage at around 5:30PM, we were in the hotel for 30 minutes, used the toilet and left. We didn't search for money until next day, we did look for our passports, which were in the same place as left. When we found out of the missing we directly contacted the hotel, around 8:00AM on Friday 27th, already in Spain. The manager (Isabelle Garnier) was not there, we were asked to phone back at 9:00, which we did. The hotel\u2019s response, was slow and lousy, the arguments used mentioned that they had no security recording system and that we couldn\u2019t prove that the theft had happened at the hotel. We were in direct contact with all our luggage after leaving the hotel, specially with the document and money holder. We only received a presentation of the hotel to the insurance company as a reply, which is clearly unacceptable. We are back home and the pretend for us to file a Police report, which we cannot do from our Country. So far, they are leaving us with nothing. THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU WHEN KNOWING YOU ARE LEAVING THE COUNTRY. We stayed at the Mercure as part of the accord group because we understood it was a reputable hotel chain, so far, their responses have been far from acceptable\u2026 We do expect the hotel to become responsible for something that clearly happened, specially needing time to go through things, during the stay of the bags under the Mercure supervision. I will keep this posting updated with the advances, so EVERYBODY CAN KNOW WHAT KIND OF RESPONSE MERCURE AND ACCORD PROVIDE TO THEIR GUESTS.

All the staff were very friendly and helpfull when required. As already pointed out there is a TV in the room and it only has BBC world as an english speaking, but do you really go to paris to watch TV ? one point to note, is that there is a square only a couple of minutes walk ( turn left out of the hotel and then 1st right) from the hotel with loads of bistros and resturants which seemed to offer very good french (and italian!) food. For breakfast dont use the hotel, use one of the bistros in the square, our favorite was an organic resturaunt with the most amazing breads, coffee's and jams.

On arrival there were no problems checking in and we were very quickly in the (small) lift and into our room. We were on the fourth floor and there generally seems to be only four rooms per floor. The room was clean and tidy and of a good size. I think that our room was not noticably smaller than one we stayed in last year at the much more expensive Intercontinental Le Grand. Our first outing from the hotel highlighted why it was such a good choice, right near Place Vendome and the Ritz etc. Also, only a ten (or so) minute walk from the big department stores, the Opera, the Louvre and Jardin des Tuileries. The hotel is also very close to Place du Marche Saint Honore which has some good restaurants including L'Absinthe and Le Pain Quotidien. The lack of tea and coffee making facilities was a little frustrating, but at least we were always up and out quickly, making the most of our sightseeing day! We didn't use the restaurant for breakfast so can't comment there. I did find that different concierges were either super helpful, or more interested in doing their own thing, but I suppose you get that everywhere?
