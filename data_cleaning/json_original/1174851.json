It's a functional hotel with contemporary design and free parking. The public areas, especially the staircase, are reminiscent of a school or a retirement home, but they've tried to spruce it up with modern furniture and funky paintings. Most of the staff is friendly and helpful. The wine is good, but the food was mediocre at best. The rooms look exactly like the pictures on their website. They are clean, light and spacious enough. There are plenty of conveniently placed plugs so you can charge all your devices easily. Wi-Fi costs 8 euro though and is flaky. The bathroom was clean, but small and the water pressure is on the weak side. The pillows are clumpy and need replacing. It was very quiet though - no noise from either the street, the corridor or next door neighbors. If you are looking for functional, this hotel works. If you're looking for charm, look for it elsewhere. Especially if you're on a sightseeing trip, you may want to stay closer to the center, as the hotel is located in between a residential and business area.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riga, Riga, Latvia", "Title": "\u201cTerrible location\u201d", "Author": "vladislavs999", "ReviewID": "UR127500169", "Content": "While hotel itself is pretty good, the inconvenient location makes it less than perfect choice.

The hotel was in between the 2 locations so that worked well for us. The room was clean and modern. We separated the beds which were made up individually as requested. There was a nice desk area and the tv was on the wall in front of the beds. The bathroom was modern with a small bottle of shampoo and small bottle of body wash. I liked the magnifying make up mirror. The staff at the front desk were pleasant and helpful. The hotel was packed with business people and flight attendants. We had drinks at the bar one evening. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant as it was 19 euro each for breakfast if we ordered that when we checked in or 22.50 euro if we walked in the next morning. We drove down the street and found a great little shop that had amazing sandwiches and coffee. For 10 euro we were ready to go! The laminate floors were scratched and scraped up, leaving them looking dirty. The bathroom had the very familiar (though I cannot understand the attraction) glass partition \u00c2\u00bd wall (so water splashes out of the shower no matter how careful you are) and removable shower head. The shower head had low water pressure. A door or shower curtain would have been much easier, cleaner, and save on all the towels it takes to absorb the water. I just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get that design??? The hair dryer was mounted in the bathroom in front of the mirror, but we both used flat irons and had to plug them in the bedroom. There was no other mirror to use except for the one mounted inside the closet-made doing our hair difficult. The hotel places several thermoses of coffee near the door so you can make a cup on your way out. Great concept, but by far the worst coffee I have ever had. Really. The bar felt like a Holiday Inn Express buffet breakfast room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 with a bar. When our husbands arrived on the last evening, we went down for a drink.

For tourists it could be worth considering a more central location. Yet for the price for this hotel you might not get a hotel of the same standard downtown. The hotel offers nicely decorated rooms, probably recently refurbished, of modern design. The beds are very good. The room was of medium but totally sufficient size, with a wooden floor, a bed, a desk and a built-in wardrobe with safe. There was a coffee and tea set free of charge. The modern design bathroom had a luxurious shower and sink, yet no tub. The overall impression was good. The outer appearance of the hotel does no justice to the very accomodating atmosphere of the rooms. On Sunday you can ask for a late check-out at 17:00 (great) for no extra charge and breakfast is served until noon. Breakfast buffet at 22,50 Euros a person was not cheap, yet acceptably priced. The buffet offers a wide range of savory dishes (from saussages to asian curry) as well as cheese and cold cuts or sweet treats like muffins or cake.

It wasn't so much the hotel in itself but the distance into the city centre everyone had commented on. However after staying there this weekend, I can say that I don't think it was as bad as some of the reviews make it out to be. It is easy to get to from the airport, the first stop Zuid-WTC station on a train toward Utrecht (6 mins), then from the train station you have three options: walk (about 20mins); jump on the 165 bus which stops right outside the hotel (about 5 mins), or take the no5 tram and then a 5-10min walk to the hotel. As for getting into the city centre, we used the no 5 tram, which took about 10-15 mins. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great way to see the city and easy to jump on and off at the various parts. The only down side we found that was if you stayed out past midnight, then it was tricky to get back - it was a 30euro metred taxi ride - so none negotiable, otherwise jump on one of the last trams just before midnight and it's no problem. The hotel itself was clean, comfortable and staff were pleasant. It was perfect for our stay, as we were out and about all day, only really needed a bed to crash on that wasn't expensive and I got a good deal for two nights (\u00c2\u00a3106) on the bidding website. If I was to go to Amsterdam again I would have no problems staying here again although I'd probably try to stay closer to the centre only just to get more of a feel for the Amsterdam that you go to see - canals and period buildings rather than apartment blocks and office buildings in the area of the hotel.", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Groningen", "Title": "\u201cnear airport, expensive breakfast, far from city centre\u201d", "Author": "flapfluit", "ReviewID": "UR77268653", "Content": "Hotel looks like an old office building witch they turned into a hotel.

The Hotel itself is a converted office block, so it looks a bit boring art deco fom the outside, but inside it's ultramodern and spanking new. The rooms are a good size, with a study desk, flat screen telly in the wall, top quality furnishings and squeeky clean spacious bathroom. Room service is young and friendly. So this is the hotel's strongest selling point. One dispointment is that there's only 10 double bed rooms in the hotel, so if you're one of those people who hates sleeping on a sheet pulled over 2 twins (They also had a double woolen blanket, but no double duvet), then I suggest you confirm exactly what you are getting before booking. I thought I'd hate the the together twins, but I actually didn't take much notice in the end as everything else was so nice. Distance from the canals is a small issue. It is a 10-15 min walk to the tram/metro station, and then a 30-40 minute ride to Centraal. Or you could get off somewhere on the way if you like. (eg the canals, Rembrantsplein, Rijkmuseum etc). It's quicker by Metro, but the wife preferred the tram as she found it quite charming and picturesque. Do get yourself a whadoyoucallit ticket sheet as it works out cheaper. Do remember that everything in the minibar costs 5 euros or so. Even a small packet of peanuts or M&Ms! I ended up gorging down 30 euros worth of stuff, before I read the fine print purely by chance.

Paid US $65 a night for four nights and was very happy with that, but disappointed when I realized how far away I was from anything. I'm a 38 years old male and was in Amsterdam by myself to see the sights. I agree with the reviews here that say the hotel was nice and a good value, but the extra transportation costs probably detracted from the value. Was tired after the long flight so lazily took a taxi from the airport, which was about 30 Euro. Tried to take the Connexxion from the airport, which advertises as dropping off passengers at NH Musica, among many other places, but the driver and others didn't know where it was (or didn't want to drive there). I showed the taxi driver my hotel confirmation and he got me there just fine. Short nap and then got out and walked. Ended up walking all the way to Centraal Station. With a stop for Thai food and a detour through Vondelspark, it took a few hours. Taxied home for about 20 Euros. The next day I bought a 72 hour tram ticket at Zuid and began using the tram the rest of the way. There are two stops on the #4 line about a 10-15 minute walk away. If you have a backpack, you can use the tram, but any larger luggage, I wouldn't recommend due to the distance and the sometimes crowded trams at peak times. The tram hits Museumplein, Leidesplein, and Centraal Station - it's about twenty minutes to Leidesplein and the last train leaves southbound (toward NH Musica) from Leidesplein shortly after midnight. If you want to stay out later, your options are taxis or renting a bike. If I stayed at NHMusica again, I might just rent a bike. There is a bike shop directly across the street but the worker there told me they don't rent bikes that you can only rent bikes \"downtown.\" That's probably the cheapest option if you stay at NHMusica and aren't on a business expense account: tram to the center city, rent a bike, and use it for your stay. If I stayed at NHMusica again, that's what I would do. As far as the hotel goes: 1. very slow elevators for the apparent newness of the place (it made me thing the building is actually a bit older and had a previous life as something else). 2. there is a small bar area directly next to the check-in counter. 3. there is a restaurant that never seemed to have much activity, off of the lobby. The rooms: 1. at check-in, I was given a choice of a shower or a tub. picked a shower and was pleased with the pressure and hot water. 2. the bed was king-sized but that was two pushed-together double beds 3. flat screen tv on the wall 4. hardwood floors were very nice 5. half-price on the minbar (beer, wine, water, snacks). One advantage of the location was that, if you are a jogger, it was very easy to jog east the the river and Amstel Park (about five minutes away jogging) for a nice circuit. I did a longer run south along the Amstel River and was in the country very quickly. There was a nice path all along and I went five miles south and back. That was a nice unexpected perk of the hotel's remote location. It really was as far south as Amsterdam as possible while still being within the city limits. I'd stay there again and would recommend it, if you get a tram pass or a bike or are traveling on an expense account. The rooms are good but I missed being in the middle of the city.", "Date": "June 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cLow-Cost Top Quality Accommodation on the Outskirts of Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "Mark241", "ReviewID": "UR30693781", "Content": "Located a 15 minute walk south from the Amsterdam Zuid station and business district, the NH Musica is a brand spanking new hotel, providing a high level of comfort to its guests. Rooms feature plush, stylish 4-star furnishings with soft, comfortable bedding, flatscreen TV, wooden flooring, and a lovely bathroom and great toiletries. There's an in-room safe, wired broadband (6 EUR for 60 minutes of use in a 24 hour period), and the hotel provides steam irons, making a nice change from the usual hopeless ones provided. The hotel sits firmly in a residential area, with a lot of parkland nearby (we managed to spot some herons as we walked along the road!); it's near a small Jewish community, with two kosher restaurants and a kosher convenience store across the road from the hotel; there is also a lovely cafe perfect for cheap but delicious brunch a five minute walk towards Amsterdam Zuid, on the left-hand side of the road. Just past this there's also a shopping mall with supermarkets and other stores. Great deals can be found for this hotel, so there has to be a catch - and it's the hotel's distance from -anywhere-. If you're a business traveller, it's a nice fifteen minute stroll through a the residential area to the office complexes of Amsterdam Zuid. If you're a leisure traveller, however, it's a ten minute walk to the nearest tram stop, and then 15 minutes to the museum district, or 20-30 minutes to town. The hotel took great pains to explain how easy it was to get anywhere, and to be fair, the tram route does take you to pretty much any of the major tourist attractions. Schipol is only 6 minutes by train from Amsterdam Zuid. The hotel is still also relatively new, and as such is still 'bedding down' a bit. We had a fire alarm one morning that appeared to be caused by a fault. No apology was offered by the hotel (a little note slipped under the door from the management to explain and apologise would have been the very least I'd have expected). The fire alarm in my room also emitted a quiet high-pitch beep every two seconds - which a room transfer didn't solve, although to the hotel's credit, they did get an engineer out to fix it after a fair bit of complaining. So, would I return? Most definitely yes. I booked this hotel with one week's notice and got a 70 EUR / night rate. If you wanted a hotel of similar quality in central town, you'd easily be paying 120 - 180 EUR / night. So it's just a trade-off that you need to decide on.

I timed the walk one night and it was almost 16 and a half minutes! A terrible walk in the freezing cold and of course the last thing you want to do after a very busy day and night. There is a tram stop about 12 minutes from there, but due to not knowing the city or how to get tram clipcards, we only used this on the last day. The only review I could find on this place was on their website, saying that it is close to restaurants and bars - this too is not true. There is zero nightlife there, but it is about an 8 minute walk to a small shopping centre. The rooms were very modern and spotless - lots of cupboard space and a nice size flat screen television. Very nice bathrooms - again very modern. The staff were quite helpful and were able to answer most of my questions. I got this hotel on a Mystery Hotel package, and of course it was alot cheaper because of that (and looking at around New Years, most places, even hostels, were costing quite a bit!). It was obvious the hotel was not particularly full (seemed maybe a quarter full), so this may be on a mystery package for a while. Yes, it is a 4 star hotel and I did get it at a good price considering, but looking at the excrutiating distance between there and anywhere, I would have rather paid a bit more to stay somewhere more central.
