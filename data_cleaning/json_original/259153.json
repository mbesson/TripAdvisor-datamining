{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice Rooms but Unfriendly Service This hotel was a low-point in my trip to Mexico. First of all, it's important to stress that this hotel is in a very industrial suburb of the city. 1/2 of the rooms (the back side) face an old factory and all rooms on either side face busy expressways. Unfortunately due to shoddy construction, the architects elected not to use double-paned glass and as a result, the noise of speeding cars, noisy trucks, horns and police chases are audible. I am not sure why they did this since other hotels of this quality in Mexico City have the proper windows. If you are fairly sensitive to sounds, you will absolutely want earplugs for your stay here.There were virtually no facilities beyond the dining room (no fitness center, no pool or jacuzzi) and the little store was hardly open during my 3-day stay. Without a car, your dining options are extremely limited. You can walk 5 minutes south to a brand new Wal-Mart but be careful if you do so after dark. The worst part was the unfriendly staff. When I checked in, the clerk (a dour young woman) did not welcome me. She also could not find my reservation in the system even though Orbitz confirmed it. She indicated that this is a frequent issue and that since it was a (minor) holiday weekend, we would have to wait a couple days to straighten things out with the travel agency. I called Orbitz after I was shown to my 2nd noisy room (the first one had highway noise that was completely unbearable) and they were kind enough to fax the clerk a copy of my payment and other relevant details. When I went downstairs 40 minutes later to confirm receipt of the fax, the clerk was idly chatting with another hotel employee who was leaning on the counter. I politely interrupted and asked if the fax arrived. I was coldly told that it had but she was too busy to look at it (I guess it would have interrupted her conversation with her colleague.). At check-out 4 days later, another clerk attempted to charge me a 2nd time for the room but when I protested she apologized and wished me a safe trip. Other staff members, particularly the doorman and the night clerks would stare at you or look away rather than say hello.The only nice parts of the hotel really were the rooms (other than the noise) and the firm beds. I would not stay in this hotel again. Since this is said to be the nicest hotel in the area, if you want a more comfortable experience, you may wish to stay closer to the center of Mexico City.", "Date": "Feb 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR415619349", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Chiquitita"}, {"Content": "great breakfast and super beds Great Hotel, very nice and spacious rooms, wonderfull bathroom (only shower, but a good one)Especially the breakfast is spectacular, and you can have it from 06.00 till about 15.00 h.did not like the safety in the area, so allways in taxi (which are very affordable)", "Date": "Sep 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR423616164", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "riojaexport"}, {"Content": "buen Hotel de Paso o Negocios   showReview(21031466, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR968445758", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mineni"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d259153-r6819526-Camino_Real_Perinort-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "259153", "Price": "$109"}}
