We were put on the 25th Floor to be awaken by the noise from the renovations, which were extremely loud. We had to nearly yell to hear eachother.

We stayed at the Hilton Sydney from Feb 5-8, 2012. On our trip we stayed at the Intercontinental Sydney, the Jupiters Gold Coast and the Meriton in Brisbane. The Hilton Sydney beat them all, and we would happily stay there again! The staff were very courteous and delightful to deal with. The check-in process was seamless, we were able to check in early in the morning even though normal check-in was at 3:00p. The room was very clean. Do get the breakfast package with the executive room, it saves so much time and money. The complimentary evening drinks and afternoon tea was an unexpected bonus!! Now for the service: The mark of great service staff is not determined by whether or not they get your requests wrong, but how they recover from them. We as human beings inherently make mistakes. As happened on our stay. I had brought and AC voltage transformer with me from Canada, and accidentally put it on the wrong setting, burning it. Much to my wife's dismay whose hair straightener was supposed to be plugged into it. I asked the \"Magic\" staff for a transformer, but the person accidentally brought up an \"adapter\" ... needless to say my wife's hair straightener met its demise. I noticed what the problem was, but I opted to go purchase my wife a new (cheaper) hair straightener before I went to complain to the front desk. They immediately fetched Sei, the manager, who was absolutely amazing in rectifying the situation. She investigated the issue with the Magic staff, researched how much my wife's hair straightener cost and immediately gave us a cash equivalent for it. No protest, no fuss, just an apology and pleasent service. Prompt service, understanding of a customer's concern and immediately rectifying an error is what was great about this hotel staff. This is something out of the ordinary that I have not seen any hotel staff in Canada or US do. The rest of our stay was very pleasant. Although the only thing I can complain about is something that I found to be a problem at every hotel in Australia; the Internet service fees of $29/day is ridiculous ( I pay that as my Monthly fee in Canada).", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for a short city break or business trip.\u201d", "Author": "MBMT2003", "ReviewID": "UR126713423", "Content": "I stayed for five nights on a business trip and the hotel was perfect.

Terrible...\u201d", "Author": "E B", "ReviewID": "UR124785861", "Content": "Honestly, where to begin.... This is the worst Hilton we've ever stayed at, and we've stayed at a few around the world. We would normally overlook one or two bad points about a hotel, and I have never gone out of my way to write a detailed review before. However this hotel just continued to go from bad to worse & worse and hopefully this saves you from a similar experience! THE CLUB LOUNGE - Don't waste your time or money upgrading to the club lounge. If you're used to the high standard of food & service at most 5 star executive lounges, you will be seriously disappointed. - You are NOT provided with a full buffet breakfast in the main restaurant like every other hotel. You are only entitled to a cold continental breakfast in the lounge (stale, cold pastries, tasteless cheese, serve yourself coffee machine, sliced white bread etc) No eggs, no hot food whatsoever!! The little \"Yalla\" yoghurt pots where the only nice food option! - \"Afternoon tea\" included cold, stale scones, the Nespresso machine & a couple of apples. When I asked if it were possible to have them warmed i was told \"we have no microwave\"! We also asked for some cream to go with them, so a staff member went out the back & brought out a can of whipped cream & said \"where do you want it?\"!! OK?! - On arrival to the evening club lounge drinks, we (and several other patrons) were told that there were no tables left & asked to wait for a table to become available....what? You only have a window of time that the club lounge is open. How hard is it to count the amount of club lounge guest rooms & provide a sufficient amount of tables? - Only two of the club lounge staff, greeted us, smiled / were attentive. I don't blame them, it's just blaringly obvious that they have had zero training. ROOMS - We stayed on the club floor (level 35) & unfortunately (for us) the rooms appeared to have little or no sound proofing! - We could hear the pumping dance music & whistle blowing (a la Mykonos beach party!) coming from the club in another building on street level, throughout the night. - Other patrons coming and going, talking in the hallway etc (noises you usually hardly ever hear in other hotels) were loud! - Also, BEWARE of the \"lift & pay\" trays/fridge in the rooms! They have mini bar items that have some kind of sensor system where if you even pick up the item to look at it, you will be immediately charged the full price of the item!!! Total Entrapment, as they don't have a clear sign informing you of this. On check in we overheard a poor girl trying to dispute a apple juice charge on her bill, sounded strange at the time, but makes complete sense now. STAFF - Apart from the two friendly club lounge staff members (a really nice young Asian man, who always had a smile and was running around keeping things organised, and another male staff member who I'd guess was the club lounge manager) all the other staff looked morose & depressed... -To add insult to injury, on check out, we were told that we had been wrongly charged $84 for the buffet breakfast (the buffet breakfast we should have been entitled to with the club lounge package) But unfortunately had not received. So I complained about this & mentioned some of the other issues we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had with our stay. This front desk attendant was rude & patronising, not following standard customer service protocol, he repeatedly talked over me, and clearly didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to take on board any constructive feedback. So in the end he did not address our concerns, leaving us even more annoyed about the stay. This attendant, also refused to confirm that the wrongful charge would be removed from our bill, so fingers crossed we dont receive any other nasty surpises on the credit card bill....!! MY TIP! Save yourself the hassle and aggravation & stay at the SHANGRI-LA Sydney, not only is it the same price, but the VALUE you'll enjoy is on another level, this is a true 5 star.

This puts it in easy walking distance of Darling Harbour, the main shopping strip, China Town, the Art Gallery of NSW etc. It is the first time I have stayed here for many years and the first time since the Hotel was refurbished. Service was very good throughout our stay - we did not put many demands on it but everyone we encountered was professional, smiling and helpful. The Hotel decor is smart and sophisticated throughout. Our room felt a little on the small side for a double with king size bed but this was partly attributable to the way the desk stands out into the room. The decor in the room was modern and smart throughout with almost all functions controllable from the bed (eg all lights, the TV, electronically controlled blinds, etc). The room airconditioning was good. The soaps, shampoos etc are good quality. The shower was great. Depending on the rate available I would definitely stay again. My qualifications that hold me back from an excellent rating are: 1) The room size - felt a little small; 2) WiFi is available but I gather there is a charge (I am not sure of the cost because I used my own WiFi modem) I do think that WiFi should now be free but find most Sydney Hotels still charge for it; 3) Car parking is on the high side - it cost us $149 for two nights whereas my experience is that CBD Hotel Parking is typically between $45 and $65 per night.

The rooms are typically sized for an inner city hotel but they are very clean, comfortable and provide everything in easy reach. They have over 40 floors, with 6 lifts servicing them and there is never a long wait even when you are on the 42-43rd floors. Amenities are plentyful, i never run out of anything there and if i forget my shaver or Shaving cream, i can ring concierge and they will provide dental kits (toothbrush and toothpaste) or shaving kits immediately. Towels are clean, fluffy and always more than i actually need. Internet is easy to access, although i would prefer they had WIFI in their rooms, its only available on some floors. The bed is comfortable, pillows are really soft but you have 5 of them to stack if you need more support, or better yet you can actually choose a pillow from the pillow menu. They always have a Magazine or 2 for you to read and the rooms are very peaceful with great sound proofing. The rooms near the elevator are probably the only ones with issues, and i would strongly recommend picking the rooms away from lifts in ANY hotel anyway. They also provide complimentary drinking water in the rooms and usually this is accompanied with a fresh apple. I cant really say anything bad about this place, the staff also make a great effort to remember your name. I was pleasantly surpirsed to be greeted by name stepping out of the cab one day after months of not coming to sydney by the bell boy who opened the door, and the cafe' staff near the main doors also make an effort to remember my preference in caffine! He didnt remember my name but i was only interested in coffee at 7am! The ONE thing i have noticed, (and this could be for eco friendly purposes) is that they have stopped providing the fabric carry bags in the rooms, and they have also stopped the personalised welcome cards. I used those bags to keep dirty laundry etc seperated in my luggage etc.. its not a big deal but I am clutching at straws to say anything negative. Price wise, they competitive and very marginally more expensive.

The room was clean except my wife found writing & chewing gum on the pages of the service directory. She contacted \"Magic\" & it was later replaced with a clean one. The staff in the Executive Lounge were courteous. We were surprised that everything was self service. My wife was intimidated by the coffee machine as there were no instructions. A staff named Chi quickly came to the rescue & made a coffee for her. Later it became very busy during evening drinks and there were many people lined up waiting for a table. The Living Well Health Club was great with good facility & long opening hours 5:30am to 9:30pm. Unfortunately the hotel restaurant was closed but there were plenty of good restaurants nearby. In general we had a reasonable stay but not a memorable one.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cBlisssssss\u201d", "Author": "Gin_Goh", "ReviewID": "UR122636708", "Content": "The best sleep in our 10 day Cairns and Sydney trip!

The bathrooms are set out really weirdly so you can barely get to the sink although You do have a walk in shower. The business centre is quite outdated and the computers v slow. The bed was a king which consisted of two single beds pushed together, they didn't even have a mattress protector across both so it was quite uncomfortable. As it was just a sheet over the top.

As a regular Hilton traveller this was my first visit to the Sydney outfit. Breakfasts - amazing choice.

Good quality, fresh and pretty quick service. I think this is one of the best I've had outside the Maldives. Rooms - these were on the compact side and there seemed to be little difference on the Exec floors. The negative features were the narrow space between wardrobe doors and the wall which meant you couldn't have the doors open and walk past. Also the glass doors of the cupboards caused some nasty bangs to the head - being at awkward heights. For one person they were fine, but as a couple I think we would be pushed to stay more than a night or two. My previous experience at Blue Sydney had much more spacious accommodation. On a positive note, the beds were comfy, pillow menu improved sleep and dark blinds were good. internet connection was excellent and lighting spot on - range of low lights, desk lights and room switches. Gym - this is by Living Well and well done to Hilton for getting an arrangement with a proper gym! This makes such a difference to those of us who want to continue to work out whilst working abroad. Classes on offer great, particularly Tim's \"HardCore\" and Erin's spin. Pool and steam rooms also nice to relax in after a work out. I wish more Hilton's would follow suit. Housekeeping - reasonably good, although my fresh milk was left to sit out for a day or two until I requested it removed. (You cant put it in the fridge as it charges for everything removed). Laundry service pretty prompt although the charges were pretty extortionate - $6 for one underwear item.

Stylish from the outside and the inside; You enter the revamped, renovated rooms and quite frankly, someone spent some serious dollars on styling them. Impressive looking. From the moment you enter the property, it says classy without being over the top. Staff is attentive and helpful. Room (that I was in at least) was notably clean. They also tend to helpful towards early check in if rooms are available, which is a positive. Putting customers first with this sort of attitude is well worth mentioning in my view. However, remember you pay for the privelege: the property is not exactly top when it comes to economics. That said, there is quite a bit in the area food-wise as well as a good size, upmarket mall next door. Queen Victoria Building \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of my fav Sydney buldings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and all it has to offer is across the street. Cab from the airport shld run you to around AUD$40. There are several subway stations nearby with the major bus station across the road. So, lets get to it: The good? a) Stylish. I like my hotel rooms to look and feel modern. And these foot the bill easily. Well thought out, impressively presented rooms. Flat screen TV, TV in the shower (nope, not making that up: IN the shower) toiletries are also more upmarket, which is always a nice, well thought out touch. b) Location: it was good for me, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll put it in the plus column but beware: it is not near the major Sydney waterfont attractions. c) Executive Lounge. If you (somehow) qualify for access, this is most definitely worth checking out. d) Staff: very friendly and professional. Not intrusive at all. Which whilst yes, we should expect that, is unfortunately not always ubiquitious. A nice touch. e) Rooms are off a good size, as are the bathrooms. They do not try to jam too much bulky furniture into a too small a room. Someone clearly had a good think about what shld go into the room and how that shld be achieved. It worked in my case. The bad? a) They have one of those automatic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pick up and its charged to your hotel bill\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd type arrangements which I find really, really annoying to the point of being pointless. If you have young kids who like to touch things, you could find your bill tripling. How many times have I seen couples arguing at check out claiming not to have had the Pringles. I am not sure why these are here, but I am sure there are better ways at internal control over your staff. b) Cost of internet comes to approx 10~12% of the room PER 24 HOURS. I know the argument can be made both ways (ie: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a service that is provided and thus shld be paid for) but I am firmly in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153build it into the cost of the room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd camp. When you spend serious money on a seriously stylish room, you do not expect to spend 55 cents PER MINUTE upto $29 for 24 hrs of OK internet access. c) Location: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good and bad: remember this is NOT near Circular Quay/the Rocks and northern part of the CBD. Its is closer to Central Station than it is to Circular Quay. If you are here for tourist reasons, they are a managable 10~15 min walk away. Parking is available but I did not use it. The hotel also has a lot of food options, but I did not avail myself of them so cannot offer an honest opinion on them. Overall? Solid. Nice. The hotel is one of the more modern Hilton hotels in the chain and this is easily reflected in what is around you. It looks and feels fresh. The bad points are not necessarily only with this hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they are common and often, the more you pay for a hotel, the dearer these things become \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so I do not hold it against the property.

This hotel just goes from strength to strength in my observations of staying there, over the last 2 years. Incredibly, it just keeps getting better and better! I have also found that once I did stay regularly, and frequently, the hotel and all its staff really went above and beyond recognising my loyalty. The Hilton Hhnours reward programme provides great benefits across all Hilton properties, especially as a Diamond member. I found that as I was staying reasonably regularly at times at Hilton Sydney, and the service as a regular guest has been truly exceptional and outstanding.Everyone, in every department, from the great little caffe in the lobby, to the restaurant, to the exec lounge, to the reception, have always gone out of their way to make me feel like I'm at a second home. To be honest, I have felt so lucky to have such wonderful times with friends, family and loved ones in this beautiful hotel, with such amazing quality in its bars, restaurants, and also especially its rooms and accommodations. The Hilton Hhonours representative / manager for the hotel, originally Sae Yi, and now Juliette, have been two exceptionally warm and helpful hospitality professionals, and are always so nice and welcoming. They have really suprised me many times with their care and attention to detail, especially as I can imagine they must have many regular guests who would stay more than I have. Anke in the executive lounge and all her staff are always a wonderful welcome back to the hotel, and really add a touch of class, and wow all the guests in the lounge. I have really enjoyed spoiling some of my friends with the lovely sophisticated ambience and calm, high above the busy traffic of George St below in the evenings, when staying at the Hilton Sydney. There really are so many staff that I could mention, who have been so charming, and exceptional, and really been a big part of why I have loved staying at this hotel so much. The other reason I would definately give the Hilton Sydney the top hotel in Sydney billing, are the really exceptional bars and restaurant, which will definately leave all the other 5 star hotels for dead. An example was on my 50th stay, having a live snake 'kissing' my face at the \"Extreme Cabaret\" in the Zeta night club! I certainly won't forget that! So thank you Hilton Sydney, for so many great memories, and also as a reasonably regular guest, for the outstanding service.... really perfect and 10/10!

That's why it is always disappointing when one of the companies that you patronize let's you down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as was just the case at the Hilton Sydney. My wife, Stef, and I had been looking forward to returning to Sydney to speak at a conference, and when making our hotel arrangements, there was no doubt that we would book the Hilton Sydney. We had stayed there together a few years ago and I've made it my regular hotel for any trips to Sydney ever since. This time, the rate was steeper than usual ($449 AUD), but as a Diamond member, breakfast was included (and for the uninitiated, breakfast in hotels is generally a small fortune), and access to the lounge provides a nice, quiet (and scenic) place to work. We arrived in high-spirits shortly before noon, only to be informed that our room was not yet available. However, we were informed by the young lady working the reception desk that she would \"call housekeeping and put a rush on the room\". In the meantime, we were offered use of the lounge. We decided instead to simply check our bags and head out for some lunch. The young lady assured us \"by the time you return, I'm certain your room will be ready\". When we returned an hour and 25 minutes later, we were told that our room was still not available and were ushered up to the lounge to wait. An hour later, a brief check with the lounge receptionist was greeted with \"I will call and check on it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what was your name again?\" Mind you, there were only two other people in the lounge at the time, and the same young lady had written my name down when we arrived. Another hour passed without a word, at which point I inquired again and was told \"I'm not sure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c let me call housekeeping for you\". I asked her if they had not talked to her an hour ago, and was told that \"they are very busy because the hotel is fully booked\". I asked her if that meant that no rooms were being cleaned. Her response was, \"well, your room is on one of the executive floors\". \"So, you are telling me that not a single person staying on the executive floors has checked out today? Because, if they have, then I would think a room with a 'rush' on it would take priority over cleaning rooms for people who are not checking out.\" I was again told that she would call housekeeping and get back to me. Less than 5 minutes later, she magically appeared with our room keys. Sadly, upon arriving at our room, I realized that travelling alone is very different from travelling with someone. The rooms at the Hilton are perfectly adequate for a single individual, but definitely not for two people with luggage. Stef had her large suitcase and a small toiletry suitcase, and I had my standard 22\" roll-aboard. In addition, we both had our computer bags. We had barely entered the room before Stef was complaining about the lack space to put the suitcases and lack of drawers to unpack her stuff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are two drawers and the closet. The bathroom is tiny and poorly laid out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so tiny in fact that two people can not stand in front of the mirror together. There is almost no room for a woman's toiletries near the sink unless you take all of the usual hotel \"amenities\" and put them out in the hall on the counter above the minibar. Frustrated, I returned to the front desk to ask about another room. I was informed that the hotel was completely full. I asked about an upgrade \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to which I was informed \"you are already on the executive floor and that's all we ever upgrade people to\". I found this odd, because as a Diamond member, I have regularly been upgraded to junior suites, and even to the occasional full suite. Nowhere on hilton.com does it say that your Diamond status upgrades are \"limited\" to the executive level. I mentioned that on the previous stay in the hotel with my wife that we had a lovely room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which I found out was one of their \"relaxation rooms\". I asked about availability of one of these and was again told it was booked. I inquired about availability later in our stay and was informed that I could, in fact, have one of those rooms for an additional $80/night or to the \"relaxation suite\" for an additional $150/night. But when you are already paying in excess of $400/night, that is simply ridiculous. Again, I inquired about upgrading as a Diamond member and was again told \"we don't upgrade past the standard executive floor room\". For breakfast the next morning, we headed to the lounge, only to find that it is a continental only breakfast. We headed down to the restaurant and definitely enjoyed the breakfast buffet there. Following breakfast, we made the decision to walk the two blocks down to the Westin and check their availability. I had previously stayed in the Westin and loved the hotel. Not only did the staff greet us warmly, they allowed us to have a quick look at the two different room types they had available. In chatting, they even informed us that they had heard from others about the size of the rooms at the Hilton. The \"standard\" Deluxe room at the Westin is 1.5 times the size of the Hilton, and the Deluxe Executive room is almost twice the size. The rooms all feel even larger thanks to the floor-to-ceiling windows, compared to a rather dark feel at the Hilton. And the kicker was, their standard room rate was just almost $150 less than the Hilton. We opted for the executive room so that we could use the lounge during our stay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even though working in the room is a definite option at the Westin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and we still came in $75/night cheaper than the Hilton. We headed back, packed up our bags and went to check out. At the reception desk, the young lady asked me if I was headed home early \u00e2\u20ac\u201c strange I would think since she could clearly see that I had just arrived yesterday and was supposed to stay for a week. I told her \"no, I'm actually moving down the street.\" She seemed puzzled by this answer, so I told her that I was dissatisfied \u00e2\u20ac\u201c recounting the three and a half hour wait the previous day. She replied that the hotel was fully booked, so that might have been the reason for the delay. I went through the whole \"logic\" thing again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c asking how a \"rush\" on a room meant that we ended up in our room at the standard check-in time. I was then informed that \"we have a lot of flight crews that check in and out at odd hours\". I'm not really sure what that had to do with my situation, but oh well. I then said, irregardless of the wait, the room was simply too small for us to live in for a week. She then informed me that \"our rooms are standard size rooms for hotels in Sydney.\" I responded that she might want to take a walk down to the Westin and ask to view one of their \"standard sized rooms\" so as to be better informed.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201cImpressed by the value for money\u201d", "Author": "coralkiwi", "ReviewID": "UR118972344", "Content": "My first visit to the Sydney Hilton impressed me.

The hotel is generally excellent but when there's something fundamental which puts you off revisiting, you have to just come out and say it. I'm even thinking of giving up my HHonors membership if this is a real Hilton trend (my second experience of this issue at a Hilton). The bathroom has no door. The sliding panel in the same frosted glass as the wall closes most of the gap where the door should be but it isn't a door. And you'll note the reference to 'most' of the gap. You can't actually see very well through the frosted glass but you can certainly see through the thin air where the sliding panel doesn't quite align with the neighbouring panel. Seriously, what designer thought that we all want to share our bathroom activities with others in the room? Call me old fashioned but when did having a door to shut suddenly stop being a good idea? It's enough to put me off going back but the experience in the Glass Brasserie probably would too. Limited options for vegetarians but the gruyere souffle was just sensational. The problem was the wait for the drinks, which we really needed after a long day. The original waiter had apparently forgotten and we had to ask another one who served all the food. And he was great. When we came to pay the bill, we left a cash tip for the excellent service we had from waiter number two but who should suddenly appear at the table but the original guy with no memory, who snapped up the cash. That was really annoying. Having said all that, if you find yourself in the restaurant, the signature dessert 'Liquorice Parfait' is nothing short of sublime. Maybe worth going for that but bring your own bathroom door.

This was a last minute booking due to unforeseen changes in travel plans; I decided to splurge and stay the last two nights of my stay in Sydney at the Hilton. I'm glad that I did, although the strong A$ lightened my wallet significantly. Booking experience: Quick, and once I quoted my HHonors number, booking over the phone was a breeze. Check-in experience: Again, the dedicated check-in for HHonors members made checking in quick, painless and efficient. However, the person responsible for checking me in decided to make me feel important and told me that I had been upgraded to the next class of rooms, but that really wasn't the case. They gave me what I had asked for during the booking, so why they felt the need to tell me I was upgraded is somewhat odd. Room: Much smaller than what I expected. The bathroom was also rather small. The Amora hotel in Wynyard easily has a much bigger room for a comparable price. The bathrooms are bigger at the Amora as well. Nevertheless, the bathroom in my room was very clean, the towels large and plush, the toiletries generous and fragrant, and generous water pressure with ample hot water. The bed, as always, was fantastic and I could easily say that I had the best two nights of sleep during the overall stay, here. The TV (though flat screen), was a bit of a joke, and felt more like a 19\" computer monitor than a TV, and there wasn't much to watch on the TV anyway. What I really liked: The breakfast buffet at the Glass Brasserie at A$42 for a full breakfast is a bit much, but this is easily the best breakfast I've had in the city. The hot food, coffee, cold cuts, bread, fruit, yogurt and juice choices are plentiful and I must have spent about 2-2.5 hours having \"breakfast\" at my leisure and reading the complimentary newspapers. I also had drinks at the Glass Brasserie in the evening, and while one needs a reservation for food, I just walked in to the bar area, and was quickly seated in about 5 minutes at a nearby table. This place has some good (but expensive) wines. Location: Cannot get more central than this. Opposite the QVB, a short walk to the Town Hall train line, and can get pretty much anywhere from here. What I did not like: 1. The automatic bar and snack counter (which automatically deducts the cost of a snack / drink when removed, even if not consumed), was rather odd and symptomatic of a management that assumes that guests are going to steal. 2. Additionally, the fact that one has to call the front desk and get a separate fridge delivered to the room if one has things to put in the fridge is preposterous. 3. The concierge I interacted with was a bit snooty and wasn't very helpful when I asked for a map of the CBD or list of things to do for someone staying in the area only for a day and a half. 4. Finally, the elevator/ lift to the guest rooms is not the easiest to operate. You need to insert and remove the room key in a slot and quickly select your floor when a light turns green (which it does for about 1 second, after which your floor selection is not recognized.) If you're doing this for the first time, and haven't got the technique down, you might end up taking a couple of trips up and down in the lift - as I did - before getting to your floor. 5. The 1.5% surcharge on payment of the bill with a credit card is robbery. There is absolutely no reason or justification for this, and it appears to be some sort of a de-facto policy with hotels in Sydney (with surcharges ranging anywhere from 1.5% to 3.8%). For the Hilton to do this also, is just cheap... like taking a \"to-go\" bag and stuffing it with all the food one can take from the all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet. Checkout experience: Not as quick as checking in, but relatively painless. I had an early flight and needed to check out by 5:30AM. WIth this being about the peak time when the Emirates and Singapore Airlines crew (who are also put up at the Hilton) checkout, having just one person manning the front-desk was strange. However, another staff member showed up after he saw the queue growing and then it was quick. Overall stay: Very comfortable, although for the price, I expected a bigger room, a bathroom with a window, and an actual upgrade when told that I was upgraded.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money\u201d", "Author": "Lizard7275", "ReviewID": "UR117855221", "Content": "The Hilton is a good city trip hotel, not expensive for Sydney and still comfortable and convenient.

Darling Harbour is a very touristy area so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice to be close to the restaurants and activities without having to be stuck right in the middle of it. The overall feel of the Hilton is very contemporary. The lobby has a coffee shop and access to several restaurants and bars located within the hotel. The Glass Brasserie restaurant and Zeta Bar are both worth a visit. The rooms are clean and adequate but a bit boxy and small. I was there for a 5 night stay and was very glad to have access to the Executive Lounge (floor 36), otherwise my room would have begun to feel very claustrophobic. A few other challenges of the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1.) there is little to no room in the sink area of the bathroom to place any toiletries or cosmetics. I had to keep these in my suitcase and pull them out as needed to use in the bathroom. 2.) I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if this was an issue with my room (but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had the same issue on 2 different stays with 2 different rooms).

To use a hair dryer/curling iron you must use a plug in the bedroom and perform acrobatics to actually see yourself in the mirror. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doable but not exactly convenient or easy. 3.) The room is dark \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some more functional lighting would be really nice. 4.) Upgrade the Crabtree and Evelyn products provided. Nothing wrong with Crabtree and Evelyn, but for such a contemporary hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the scent is reminiscent of an old man \u00e2\u20ac\u201c think \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOld Spice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.

In the morning, they hosted a continental breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which looked very good. And all day long there were sweets, coffee, and tea available. With all the great food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c visits to the fitness center were mandatory. The hotel has an arrangement with a full fitness center and spa located in the basement of the hotel building. There are plenty of cardio, weights, classes, and a lap pool available to please even the most diligent fitness enthusiast. The staff at the Hilton is wonderfully trained, they are courteous, friendly, and helpful. Kudos to this team at the Hilton.

So glad I did since this hotel met all my expectations, although my views might be skewed by my many awful experiences with Sydney hotels (yes you Amora!). The hotel is very centrally located, across the street from the QVB and one block from the new Westfield Pitt Street mall. Very easy to walk everywhere from here. The staff was pleasant and everyone was friendly, even despite how much traffic comes through the lobby. If you are looking for a spacious room, you might want to get a deluxe room or suite at this hotel. The guestrooms are small compared to other hotels I've stayed in Sydney. I can't imagine having more than 2 people in the room - and with 2 people it would be a squeeze especially with luggage. The bathroom is small too - you can't open the bathroom door all the way since the shower is right behind it. The try to offset the size of the room with lots of very big mirrors to make it appear bigger. Despite the size, the room is clean and modern. The shower has a TV inside - kinda cool and also kinda weird. Not really necessary but cool to watch the morning news while having a nice warm wake up shower. There are also automatic blinds where they, with a push of a button, block out most of the light. It is very dark with them down so make sure to set the alarm! The bed is a little stiff since their feather bed topper is not thick enough to be too luxurious. One tip, ask for a room on the side of the hotel that faces the QVB. Otherwise you'll be facing this massive Grocon construction site happening right outside your window! Unless you're over the 40th floor, you will be waking up to hammering, metal clanging and pounding at 7am. I had this unfortunate experience but the Hilton was kind enough to move me to another room the next day which resolved this issue.

Brekkie at Glass is a must, one of the best hotel breakfast buffets I have ever seen. Rooms are small however, some with good views. Also, none have openable windows which I dont like all that much.

Its right in the heart of the central business area and surrounded by malls and shopping arcades. Its also right next to the Town Hall stop on the subway (and airport link) so that is a very nice plus. If you are a first time visitor to Sydney as I was, it wasn't an ideal location as its about 20 minutes from the Rocks/Circular Quay area that has all of the tourist attractions. I was aware of the location so the walk wasn't an issue The room is where it goes awry. First off the room had a musty smell which I assume comes from the tired carpeting in the room. The room was very small, even by European standards and had some items that just took up space like a large glass cylinder lamp that provided nearly no light at all. The shades in the room were yellowing and stained. The bathroom is also small. It has a tub which is nice but I would have much preferred more space at the sink which barely had enough room to put a toiletry bag without falling into the sink. Also it should be noted that the bathroom door did not lock and there was an opaque glass wall between bathroom and room (which meant you can watch the outline of the person showering from the bed. The lobby is quite busy with a small concierge desk. The two times we stopped to speak to the concierge, we had a negative experience. The first time I was given bad information about where to buy tickets so that disrupted our plans for the day a bit. The second time we got a snotty remark when asking to borrow the umbrellas. The breakfast that was included in our room rate was at the hotels restaurant. This was very nice with good pastry, fresh fruit, etc on offer as well as some hot items I didn't eat. Service was very good here. The executive lounge was large but also quite crowded most times. Service here was also good.

The hotel impressed on both visits! I will definitely look at staying here on return visits to Sydney -- every facility was top-notch and the hotel delivered service that matches the high quality of its facilities. It's in a great location, right in the center of Sydney, steps away from the Town Hall train station and across the street from the great shopping and restaurants in the Queen Victoria Building and along Pitt Street. Circular Quay is about a 20-minute walk or easy bus ride, and Darling Harbour is also within walking distance. Bus lines to Bondi and Coogee beaches stop within a block o two. It was an ideal location for sightseeing within the city. The hotel's facilities were impressive. The lobby is a light-filled atrium with lots of modern elements and a good vibe -- modern, but not obnoxiously trendy. The hallways were all clean, well-lit, and stylish. The rooms were on the small side, but very thoughtfully designed to maximize the space; I really appreciated that, despite being small, there was still space to hang up clothes, set a large bag, and have a working area. Lighting in the rooms was also excellent, as were the automatic shades that provided total blackout at night. The bathroom had a walk-in shower and deep-soaking tub. The concierge lounge, to which I was provided access as a Diamond member with Hilton HHonors, was superb -- a very abundant continental breakfast each morning, tea and refreshments throughout the day, a cake/pastry service in the afternoon, and very heavy appetizers at night that, on a couple of nights where I had lots of work to do, were enough to serve as a light dinner. The lounge itself was large, with several seating areas; computers with internet access were also present. The staff in the lounge was consistently welcoming and helpful. The superb concierge lounge added a lot of value to my visit. Beyond the lounge, I was impressed with service throughout my stay. Housekeeping was thorough, with thoughtful touches; front desk staff was anxious to fulfill every request; the concierge was consistently helpful in giving directions and suggestions. Everyone was very welcoming and friendly; there was no hint of a snobbish vibe.

My first visit 6 months ago was great, so I chose to stay again even though the price had gone up considerably as the hotel was completely booked. As others have noted, the hotel is a very short walk (about 1 block) from the Town Hall train station, so it is convenient for those arriving from the airport, for example. My check-in was quick, and I was pleasantly surprised when the desk agent told me that my breakfast would be free at the Glass Brasserie because there were no room upgrades available. The room was fine for me - a bit on the small side, but luxurious by European standards. Also, the room design was very modern, clean, and efficient. The location is excellent - next to the monorail, a short walk to Darling Harbor or Hyde Park, and a moderate walk to the Opera House. I didn't have a chance to check out the Executive Lounge this trip. But, I did find that the breakfast buffet at the Glass Brasserie was spectacular! It is worth the price ($30) given that food prices in Sydney are so high anywhere you go. When I entered the restaurant, the staff told me that I was not on the \"free breakfast\" list. But, after I explained my situation at check-in, the manager, without hesitation, told me to be his guest that day. I offered to pay until I was able to straighten things out at the front desk, but he told me not to bother - excellent service ethic! Upon checking out later in the morning, I noticed that guests were enjoying a tray of pastries in the lobby. I asked what the special occasion was - it was Sunday morning. So, I helped myself and was quickly on my way. There was one negative aspect to my stay, which was not under Hilton's control, and is quite unusual at any hotel. There is a lesson here for anyone finding themselves in this situation. There was a loud screaming argument in the room next door that woke me at 2:30 AM and continued for about 20 minutes. I considered calling the front desk (which is what I should have done), but that would have implicated me to the screamers next door if anything bad happened to them. At checkout, I asked what my options were in this situation. I was told that I should have called the desk to get security on the floor. I also noted this issue on the Guest Comment Card and I received a personal email from the hotel manager apologizing for the problem. There was also a hotel feature I had not seen elsewhere before -- they offer a \"pillow menu\". The guest can choose from 5 different styles (type of fill and support) in soft, medium, and firm options. Just call the front desk or use their MAGIC button. I think the staff at this hotel all care greatly about their guests. Everyone was extremely helpful and pleasant, from check-in to check-out (Concierge, front desk, restaurant personnel) - my concerns were their concerns.

My review is based on an expectation of five star, rather than whether this is a good or bad hotel. And, five star it is not. The rooms have been refurbished, but they are still the same rooms in terms of size as the old Hilton I remember from the 80s. Very small, dark, and noisy. The images that Hilton supply, are fairly true, but they don't give you a real sense of how small the room is. Nearly all the rooms have connecting doors with other rooms, and you can hear the quietest conversations from your neighbours. Asking to be moved doesn't help, because you are told that most of the rooms have adjoining doors. On top of that, the lift noise is constant - all night. So, don't expect a good night's sleep. Sydney hotels seem to be getting worse, while at the same time, more expensive. I haven't had a good hotel experience for three or four years. Charging $29.00 a day, after paying nearly $500 for a room, is just mean, and I do tire of this in Australia.

No way to keep the light from waking my spouse. The night shades on the windows work so well that I had a hard time waking in the morning because it stayed dark in the room. Since we arrived early morning (7am) our room was not ready but they allowed us the use of another room to shower and change since we just arrived from a 14 hour flight from LAX. They moved our luggage for us into our new room while we were out exploring the city for the day. That evening the chef at Glass sent up a complimentary variety of desserts for us to try. Each day they slipped weather information and any specials the hotel was running that day. The executive lounge was open all day with breakfast in the morning and light evening food. There were a couple of nights we just ate in the lounge because we weren't that hungry but there was plenty of food to choose from: sandwhiches, hot appetizers, chips and dips, sushi, etc. Breakfast in Glass restaurant each morning was fabulous. Even though it is serve yourself they will make you other things upon request (egg white omelettes, cappucino, etc). It was so nice to sit overlooking the Victoria building for breakfast each morning. We had dinner in Glass one evening but the food was not really to our liking (very meat heavy which seems to be the Sydney norm). We enjoyed a comedy show (Chris Wainhouse) downstairs in the marble bar. We topped it off with a visit to the upstairs bar Zeta. It was a fun evening for sure. We also took advantage of the free access to the fitness club downstairs. It was vastly superior to other hotel fitness rooms as it is a full club. There is plenty of state of the art equipment, indoor pool, sauna & steam room as well as a full schedule of fitness classes. Location is great with a short walk to darling harbour or the harbour area. There were a couple of nights it was raining, I was in heels and did not feel like walking the steep rocky streets so we decided to take a cab. The cab queue at the hotel was kind of a long wait and since traffic is very heavy in the evenings it took a long time to get anywhere. It was worth it anyway just have to allow enough time to get where you need to go. We ended up purchasing an unlimited bas/train/ferry pass which was very convenient since the train station is right across the street at the queen victoria building. We rode the trains & ferries quite a bit but did not ride any of the buses.

No couch etc. Room and bathroom are very well appointed though. 2. Club Lounge - we've used club lounges at a lot of hotels and this was by far the worst. The food selection and quality was plain poor. Afternoon tea was a cold scone with butter (not even cream). Evening canapes was a mix of poor quality cheese, oily pizzas and dried out pasta (no sauce). For breakfast we got there just before closure time and they litrally pulled it down around us as apposed to waiting for us to get something. I wouldn't bother with this club lounge again we were not at all happy with it. 3. Noise - the hotel has a night club under it, even on the 28th floor we got to hear the club music until the early hours of the morning. Staff were friendly but unpolished.

Glass Brasserie: We had the buffet breakfast every morning and it was delicious. Lots of selection, fresh fruit smoothies made-to-order, cereals, hot breakfast, breads, fruits, etc. The staff was extremely polite and it was the best service we received in the hotel. Zeta Bar: Modern and sexy. We really liked the atmosphere. There's a huge terrace where you can enjoy the warm evening breezes and great city views. The drinks were inspired but pricey. My one disappointment was that I ordered a Mai Tai which the menu described as being served in a pineapple. When it arrived it was in an ordinary glass. I was told after it arrived that they don't serve it in a pineapple anymore. Marble Bar: We expected a grand and opulent room but instead it was a dark and drab basement pub. The atmosphere was also drab. The staff was apathetic and the menu was boring pub food. It's too bad because this room could be something great. Concierge: The worst concierge service we've ever experienced!! They acted like they didn't want to be there and they made no effort to answer our questions or help us even though that is their job. The first time one of them gave us attitude, we just chalked it up to him having a bad day. When we experienced this every time we called or went to the desk, we realized they were just bad concierges. The hotel needs to spend some time training them. It was shocking and completely unexceptable. This is a five star property! The bellman need to be applauded though. They jumped in a couple of times when we were dealing with the concierge and tried to help us. It's obvious they see how bad the concierge service is. Why isn't management doing anything about it?

I should have added my review earlier but did not join trip advisor until today. My partner at the time and I decided to celebrate our anniversary in style and decided on the Hilton due to conveninence. Close to shopping, entertainment and restaurants which were of importance to us because it was a Saturday night and wanted to make the most of our night. Upon making the reservation, the agent was extremely rude. She was rather snotty and it sounded as if she didn't want to talk to me at all. She only gave me one word answers and didn't offer to help when I enquired about the room facilities. I was rather upset because isn't Hilton meant to be known as a 5 star property with 5 star customer service? She didn't offer to send a confirmation so I requested however it never came. So I called back calmly and again it never came. I decided to leave it at that. Upon arriving, my partner and I were informed that the room type we had booked were fully booked and we had a choice for an upgrade but non smoking or a downgrade to a smoking room. My partner is a smoker and upon making a booking, the agent didn't note this so we had no choice but to downgrade and still pay for the same rate. One thing that my partner and I thought fantastic was the express check-out. It was wonderful because we dropped our keys and left very quickly. At least that went well because a month later, when my statement arrived, I realised the hotel charged me double which again, I had to call them back and explain that this is an impossibility. After much ping-ponging, the money was finally returned into my account. Overall, just dissappointed with the service. The name Hilton doesn't mean a thing anymore.

Another thing is that I would probably rather a hotel closer to the harbour than being right in the city.

There were views, although I did have to stand on the bed to actaully see them. The TV in the bathroom - well, it's unique, although it's not something that I would require in future hotel rooms. The room was lovely and very spacious. My request via email (replied to in the affirmative by the hotel) for some rose-petals and tealights to be in the room on arrival was overlooked. A call to the very helpful Magic team ensured that when we returned to the room the next day, rose petals were strewn (yes, strewn) across the room. The finishing touch was a heart on the bed - we enjoyed this as much as the staff setting up clearly did! Magic went above and beyond the call of duty, recommending (or not recommending!) various video games to my partner when he rang to ask. The receptionist on arrival was very pleasant, and very natural. Room service was prompt and unflustered by my snoring partner. Well done for keeping a straight face. Breakfast was busy. It was quite difficult to get coffees, but service was very good for the amount of people in the resturant. Concierge must have been having a busy night the first time I tried to speak with them - no-one was at the desk, no-one even looked at us.

When choosing to pay a premium rate to stay at a 5 star hotel I am of the option that one has the right to have a certain set expectations. This hotel did in no way meet the lowest of my expectations. The entire experience on all accounts from arrival to check out was appalling. Upon arrival we were informed rudely by the front desk attendants that our room was not yet ready and our bags where taken. Upon our return that afternoon we were shown to our \"Executive Room\" to discover that there was no blind on the bathroom glass window panel to provide privacy between the bathroom (toilet) and the bedroom. This is certainly not ideal when you are sharing a room. After calling the hotel from my mobile (as the hotel phone was broken) we were left waiting in the room for over an hour before being moved to a smaller room that was not adequately cleaned and in addition was fragranced with the not so pleasant aroma or vomit/astringent cleaner. Upon complaining once more we were left waiting extensively again while the Duty Manager had the \"Engineer\" look at the blind in our original room. Another hour had passed and we were then informed that the blind could not be properly repaired however the \"Engineer\" temporarily repaired it. I.e.: erected a sheet to the glass panel with masking tape and paper clips! The next morning we woke to the toilet being non operational. Once more the multiskilled \"Engineer\" was sent to the room to apply his expert knowledge to solve the problem. Who would have guessed that this time he must have only applied a bandaid resulting in the reoccurrence of this problem 20 minutes later. After yet another discussion with the duty manager we were promised another room. While waiting for this room to become available we lounged in the executive bar where we waited 55 minutes for a wine and 1.5 hours for a cold club sandwich.. delightful! Once our room was finally ready (almost 2 hours later) we were pleasantly surprised to have been moved to a Junior Suite. This room was lovely, spacious with a great view over the city. We would have been satisfied in this room for the remainder of our stay if the shower head had not with force blown off the wall from the water pressure when turned on and further hitting my friend in the arm and leaving a hole in the wall.

From a long list of positives, the best things about the Hilton Sydney are the rooms and the location. As far as location, if you're staying in Sydney's CBD, it would be tough to be in a more convenient spot. You're a 2-minute walk from a major rail station that makes it easy to get pretty much everywhere in Sydney, and you're adjacent to the city's best shopping. The only thing missing in the area appeared to be a lot of dining options, particularly if you wanted something quick and less formal, unless you're happy with McDonald's or Hungry Jack's (Australia's Burger King). As far as the rooms, they're excellent. Stylish and contemporary, yet highly functional.

I ended up having two separate stays, meaning I ended up in two rooms, and in both the beds were extremely comfortable (and the \"pillow menu\" was a nice touch, as I was able to ask for pillows that were more comfortable for me than the standards, which were already good). The rooms are extremely quiet, with no sounds at all from adjoining rooms or outside traffic. While the room rates were quite good for a quality hotel in the heart of Sydney, the rates for some extras were frankly pushing up against the line of being ridiculous. Even accounting for the fact that free wifi in hotels seems to be quite the rarity in Australia, the price here was twice of what I saw in any other hotel. And while the breakfast buffet is very, very good, it costs more than what I paid for most dinners. If the worst things you can say about a hotel are that the wifi and breakfast - neither of which you really need to buy - are spendy, you're staying in a good place. And this is definitely a good - no, excellent - hotel.", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "washington dc usa", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location and the most wonderful breakfast buffet ever\u201d", "Author": "washing2nian", "ReviewID": "UR78812944", "Content": "This was our third time staying at the Sydney Hilton.

While we were there we ran into Lou Ferigno, a CW actress whose name I still don't remember, a few big-talking Hollywood agents, a film producer who is working on a film in Thailand and an Australian band that I didn't recognize (but others did), all in the executive lounge. The room was very modern but small, very similar to European-style hotel rooms. I never quite felt at home...the staff were extremely formal for Australians. There were only two drawers for clothes, but a decent-sized closet. We had a king bed, but it was a split king and the bed was very low to the floor and not comfortable. The blackout shades in the room were controlled by a button and were excellent! There was also a night light in the bathroom that light the whole room enough to get there without blinding yourself with the general room lighting. This was all controlled from a panel near the bed. I'm not sure why they wasted room putting a shower separate from the bathtub, this room could definitely have benefitted from the extra 2 or 3 ft. the shower occupied. We had been upgraded to the 34th floor, which is executive level. Seeing how small this was, I was wondering what the regular rooms looked like. The tv had quite a few channels (though roughly 50% seemed focused on sports, paricularly rugby). The location was great. It's in the middle of George Street right across from the Queen Victoria Building and around the corner from the Sky Tower. There is a free shuttle that had limited hours that runs all the way to Circular Quay and both the Sydney Explorer and City Sightseeing tour buses stop just outside. The Monorail stop is right next door and Darling Harbour was a 15 min. walk. The hotel is known for the Marble Bar which is interesting and the Glass Brasserie which is it's restaurant that looks out over George St. Everything in Sydney is overpriced, this was no different, but it was on par with where it should be for a higher-end hotel. Overall, I wasn't particularly comfortable, but there wasn't anything really wrong, other than the lumpy bed.

After all this, we left our bags and our mobile numbers with the idiot and asked him to call us once a room became available. we left at 7:15am (by the way he lecture an american couple straight after us about the same subject matter) we made our way to the harbour to kill time.

We had a Junior King Suite on the 32nd floor and paid a very very cheap $250 a night - with breakfast included. The check in process was efficient and quick - we arrived about 1pm and the room wasn't ready yet so they took our luggage and recommended places to go while we waited. Once we got our room keys our luggage was delivered to our room. The suite was very nice. There was about 50sq metres. There was a large wardrobe, a powder room, sofa and lounge chairs and also king size bed and full bathroom. The views were pretty spectacular. There are 5 or so narrow windows with mechanised blackout screens that are controlled by switches near the bed. They blocked out 90% of light so if you like to sleep late they were fabulous. There are also 2 separate toilets - one in the bathroom and the other in the powder room. The TV was a flat screen and had regular channels as well as Foxtel (CNN, W, Fox8 etc) There was a DVD player and you can borrow DVDs from the hotel. They have a high-tech mini bar that is pressure sensitive. If you remove an item it is automatically charged to the room account. They will provide you with a 2nd fridge if needed. We accidentally knocked a few items - but they took the charges off our account. The bed was very comfortable and they have a 5 option pillow menu - if you need it! There was a large 2 person shower and a bath. All the Crabtree & Evelyn amenities were divine! We used the spa/gym once and they have a full gym as well as 2 saunas, 2 steam rooms, spa and a 3 lane lap pool. It was very well appointed. Breakfast costs $45 pp but it was included in the room cost. We only took advantage of it on the Monday morning and were so full we could barely walk - they have a full hot buffet with made to order eggs, pancakes, waffles & French toast. There were about 9 different types of bread, plus doughnuts, muffins and cereals. Overall this hotel was 99% perfect and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a bit of luxury. The only bad thing we have to say about the stay, although through no fault of the Hilton, was that construction noise woke us on the Friday & Monday mornings.. A building was being demolished behind the hotel.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cImpeccable service\u201d", "Author": "Bambi_kimber", "ReviewID": "UR63201948", "Content": "The service was great and the room service was fantastic and the staff so courteous.

We a had to wait to late afternoon to check-in, a thing that would had not happen at our usual hotel! I asked reception for a late checkout as my husband was a speaker at a conference in the hotel on the day of check out, I was told this could be arranged for a cost of $30.00 extra!!!!! The actual \"Executive\"lounge was pretty ordinary and quite loud we could hear all conversations around us. As there seems to be no dress code with people were wearing shorts and jeans we felt we could had been in a local off the street bar. Not to mention a rather noisy child who enjoyed the sounds of it's own screams!!!! And with each scream Mum, Dad and staff thought this worthy of a round of applause! So the concept of a quiet place to go and do some work was lost at the Hilton!!!! The facilities however were very good, great gym, the superb \"Glass Restaurant\".

It is quite a long walk to Circular Quay however. Apparently there is a free tourist bus that stops very close to the hotel and stops at circular quay and other places. Unfortunately we did not know about this until our last day. Room was a good size for a couple however we found it a little cramped with 2 children under 4 as well. The furnishings in the room were of a high standard. The pillows that come with the bed are way too soft. We picked firmer ones from the pillow menu. What I did not like was the bathroom which had frosted glass walls and a lovely spotlight in the shower at shin height so those in the room got a nice silhouette of the person taking a shower. BEWARE THE MINI BAR; if you pick up an item and hold it for too long you are automatically charged for it as there are sensors on the shelves. The staff are quite happy to fix this up on the bill, but it is a bother. The staff were wonderful and most helpful. We were travelling with a 6 month old and getting high chair anywhere was no trouble and the staff all stopped to smile and comment on how happy he was. My husband called up the day before we arrived to order something special in our room for our wedding anniversary. The hotel had no record of our reservation. This was rectified without any dramas (as we had the booking receipt) and our room was upgraded to a higher floor (floor 39). They also provided a bottle of champagne and strawberries and chocolate at no charge. Food at the restaurant was superb! We had tapas in the Glass Brasserie Bar the first night. Although the actual menu was not huge, the quality was unbelievable! Breakfast was included in our room rate.

Let's start with the positives though. Location is excellent for the shoppers, right across the road from the QVB Shopping Arcade. Set in the heart of the hustle and bustle of Sydney it is well placed for sightseeing. Our purpose was a little different. We had just arrived off a long haul flight and wanted just one more peaceful evening/day before travelling on to visit relatives. By the time we got in from the airport it was too late to eat and I didn't find the room service menu too inspiring so we didn't bother in the end. We were on a high floor and the hotel is very imposing in it's size. I've been in Hiltons of this size (and bigger!) before but somehow this one just lacked something. I just did not feel at ease. Large hotels can still have a \"homeliness\" about them but this one didn't have it. Anyway, we had an Accessible Executive Room. I am disabled and the wetroom was excellent. Plenty space to move about plus a seated wet/shower which was ideal for bathing. Well positioned grabrails which is just as well as the floor tiles once you moved out of the shower area were a bit slippy to say the least. You need something with a bit of grip when your mobility is impaired. It is such a shame that having blessed the room with such good bathing facilities they had to spoil it with such a cramped bedroom. I am afraid that cramped room and accessible are not words that go together. It was difficult to find the few things we needed in our cases and manouver around the room particularly with a crutch. Tired and hungry, we decided to get some sleep and see what the next day brought. Still suffering from jet lag, I was up early and into the very busy gym by 6am. Gym is well equiped, clean and even although it was busy it was pretty easy to get on all the equipment I wanted. Also very helpful trainers. Had breakfast in the lounge. It was undergoing some work at the tiime we were there. Selection was reasonable but there was a lack of staff to assist and the coffee machine took a little working out. A member of staff could have made it so much quicker. Porters are very quick when you request luggage to be moved. There is also a very good coffee shop on the ground floor of the hotel but again very busy. So, location is great for sightseeing. It has a very good gym. Room we had was very, very cramped and overall we found the hotel impersonal and quite expensive for what we got. I'd say this is one for the business traveller.

We were allocated a room on a high floor directly behind/next to the lifts. When these were in use the whole room shook and the noise very loud. No way you could rest or sleep through that. While this room was clean and nice - it wasn't the upgraded room I had actually booked and had paid a bit more for - no bathtub or TV in the shower as advertised. When I complained the reception stated a similar story to an earlier reviewer with a problem with lift noise - that the hotel was fully booked and they could offer us a disability room. To try and have a good stay we accepted this - only to find the disability room was only the 2nd room away from the lifts. The noise could still be heard and the room still shook when the lifts were in use. It seems a disability rooms equals lack of taste in decor as the bathroom was all white and bland unlike the other room. The room still had lots of items up high - light switches, glasses, ice bucket, hangers etc so if you were in a wheelchair you would struggle to access these. Also the bathroom door was more like a heavy fire door again not good if you were disabled. Very heavy to open. This room wasn't as clean as the first and had some previous guests hair in the sink. After a long trip from the UK all I wanted was to chill out in my room for a while. I decided to write a letter to the hotel manager stating all the issues we've had. To his credit he did upgrade us to a relaxation suite for the remainder of our stay - this was lovely. Open plan living area, bedroom and huge separate bathroom - with large spa bath, shower and toiler, the suite also had an additional toilet in the living area. Great to watch the sun setting over the city while in the spa bath. Shame things couldn't have been sorted out in the first place as a Hilton Honours guest it was in my preferences to have a room far away from lifts. On checking this - it seemed to have been \"reset\" Very unsettling to have to pack and unpack for 3 rooms in 4 days! Hotel charges $29 for 24 hour Internet access. While this time my rate didn't include breakfast. I would give the thumbs up to Vivo on 388 Geogre street - great options for vegetarians and good big portions. Reception areas were all very clean.

There was so much food to choose from, and they seem to pride themselves in catering for all tastes/diets.

From omelettes to waffles, the Hilton catered for everyone. But without a doubt, the most indulgent part of breakfast was walking up to the employee whose sole job seemed to be to make fruit smoothies! What an inventive way to encourage me to get some of my 5 a day! With regards to the room, it was absolutely perfect! A huge double bed, sofa and a good amount of storage space which is always a bonus. The bathroom was a very good size, and very modern.

Next morning we went to breakfast to Glass restaurant which was great but we had to pay for that because only the breakfast at the club lounge was included. It was a total rip-off.

The 25 meter lap pool in the hotel was also a big attraction for me. I got a discounted deal on expedia for a Executive King room which included access to the executive lounge on floor 36 for a no more to pay breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks and canapes. I took a train from Sydney airport which was a quick way to get to Town Hall station. If you follow the malls to the Galleries Shopping Center you can emerge right next to the hotel. As expected the hotel was very busy in the lobby so I went up to the executive lounge to check in. I was greeted by a courteous Hilton staffer called Anika who seemed to be running the lounge and training two staff members at the same time. This was the first hint that the competent Hilton staffers were perhaps being asked to stretch a bit thin for what I would learn was a fully booked hotel. I was checked in efficiently to a non smoking room that instantly hot me with the not too stale stench of cigar smoke veiled in room deodorizer. Back to Anika who was apologetic and managed after much advocacy with colleagues find me another similar room which only differed in that it was disabled accessible in the bathroom. The Executive King room has a range of pros and cons. The hotel rooms are in the upper half of a 43 floor tower. It was clear that the Hilton had been refurbished around an old businessman's hotel sized room; that is small. The king bed had 10 cm clearance from the desk chair as one sat down. A small glass desk looked cluttered and there were no other chairs in the room. This made one need to edge around the bed avoiding sharply designed furniture edges. The look of the room was modern and clean with white, chrome and glass details. There were a set of windows with a meter wide wall in between, set in a very thick external wall which meant you had to lean into the window alcove to catch a sight of the splendid city and peak of water views. The windows did have very good black out motorized blinds. The sound insulation in the rooms was poor, you could hear the next room's blinds being lowered and listen in to normal volume conversations in the corridor as people stood opposite your door. The hotel minibar was one of those horrible ones which have a trigger which bill you as soon as you remove a local beer and then think, no i really want a Hein... damn ! I cannot comment on the bathroom design except to say that people with disabilities still have a sense of aesthetics and designers need to get a bot more creative with shower chairs and rails. Having said that the access features were new and bright and did not remind me of a run down public spinal rehabilitation unit as some disabled bathrooms do. The lobby was very busy and had a great feel to it. A range of travelers, beautiful young sydney things and dodgy looking C.U.B.s (Cashed Up Bogans) moved around. The Glass Brasserie is worth a splurge for its food and fantastic floating light and glass design. Zeta bar is also a hot spot and has good cocktails. The Marble bar is some sort of 15 year old bakers lair with beautiful marble art works. The location of the Hilton cannot be beaten. Close to trains, right in the best shopping areas, walk to the Convention Centre and Darling Harbor and the Opera House. So if you are alone and want a compact stylish room in a hotel with a real buzz and great location consider the Hilton. If you are with partner of any size above 6 then consider the Sheraton on the Park, splurge at the Westin or head to Circular Quay area.", "Date": "December 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeton", "Title": "\u201cMagnificent - a truly great experience\u201d", "Author": "LizzyLeeton", "ReviewID": "UR50475673", "Content": "From the moment we arrived to the moment we checked out was a tremendous experience.

Our room had a great bathroom with a 2 person multi jet tub with bath salts that were replenished nightly, shower with multi showerheads and a 1/2 bath near the entrance to our suite. Every night we received turn down service and a little treat on the pillow! The furnishings were modern, neutral paint scheme and 3 TVs (including one next to the tub \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all flat screen HD TVs. Oh, the tub has a picture window you can look out of while you soak and enjoy the city views! The morning of our check out there was a slight error in the billing, but was taken care of with no questions! Also, the Glass restaurant provided us with a great meal on our last night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the food was excellent! We ate in the executive lounge every morning for breakfast and found it to be superior to other executive lounges at this hotel chain. Thanks to the staff who made our short stay very enjoyable!

Location is good. A man outside to take care of cars was very nice and helpful. He helped us a lot. Walked in the room, that was small but we knew it so we were just happy to be in a proper hotel...nice, modern and clean. But I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and noticed a plug of the basin was down and couldn't pull it up. It was basically out of order, broken. Why? I really wondered how they managed to clean and not notice that a plug didn't work. Talked to the reception, they sent someone straightaway to fix it up while we were out so that was ok though I was bit disappointed with Hilton missed something like that. Then at night, I was going to use a hair dryer but then the power outlet on the wall in the bathroom didn't work. Couldn't put a plug in. This gave me as a huge disappointment because this showed me that they don't really maintain the bathroom...I had to use the one which was in the mini bar to dry my hair, looking at the mirror in the bathroom. I couldn't be bothered to tell them but left feedback so they will know if they read it. You don't really want a repairman all the time in your hotel room, do you? Well, anyway we were still happy with the nice room. Unfortunately, the last night there was horrible. We had a very early morning flight next day, we were already sleeping at around 2 o'clock of course, some guys on the same floor were badly drunk and talking so loud and walking around on the hallway, their room door banging...woke us up. Eventually someone from the other room went out and told them to be quiet it seemed like, but that showed this Hilton's customers level and no hotel staff actually came up to take care of it. It might be hard to know unless someone calls the reception or something but I wasn't really impressed with this. I'm not sure if I recommend to my parents but I might say to my friends it's ok to stay here though you might find something better around there.

I can't fault the service received: front desk was fast and efficient, concierge was helpful and knowledgeable (they saved us hours by suggesting best routes to explore Sydney by foot) and polite, room cleaning people accommodating. My only minor complain on this regard would be that we could not get to extend our check out time by one hour, but that is hardly something serious. The room was very nice, clean and comfortable, albeit in the small side, if you smuggle a cat inside please don't swing the poor thing, it will bang his head in the walls in no time :-) The bathroom was quite modern, including a TV in the shower! (which was of no use since the speakers were out of the shower, so you could not hear what you were watching like showering :-/ ). The only major fault was the lack of proper night table in one side of the bed, where the hotel decided to put a flimsy and very small glass table. I used the ample window swill as an improvised night table, but this should not be necessary. Also very few hangers for your clothes. You have a good safebox and good ironing facilities. The Internet service cost in the room is extortionate, you should not use it, even if you can afford it, it is simply not fair and hotels charging so much should not be encouraged. There is free internet service in the vicinity (via well known burger joints) or much better priced in a nearby supermarket or well known coffee shop, so leave you business attire behind, enjoy a greasy burger or overpriced coffee and use the Internet at your heart's content elsewhere. Unfortunately the swimming pool was closed, so I can't say how good or bad it was. No arrangements were made for using a different one elsewhere, which is something I have seen in other hotels. The breakfast was very good, but the service was a bit complicated (getting an egg involved a somehow complicated procedure), the best feature being the fantastic view of the Victoria Building across the street (the whole wall is clear glass). The location can't be beaten. you are a block away from Hyde Park and the museums, 2 train stations (or short walk) away from the Circular Harbour for great views of both Sydney's Bridge and the Opera House (both can be reached walking) as well as access to ferries and tourist boats. China Town and Darling Harbour are a short walk away or you can catch the expensive Monorail, of which you have two stations just around the corner.

I got a quick call from the super helpful concierge letting me know that he was collecting tulips I ordered and that the colours I ordered were not as bright as other tulips availalbe due to season, and asked me if I would be ok changing colour to improve the quality of the flower, or if I wanted to change to something else. I told him I would trust him. After a lovely walk around darling harbour we returned and the front desk gave me a thumbs up to let me know all was ready. We went up to the room, it was covered in rose petals, the bathmaster package I ordered meant the bath was freshly drawn with essential oils and more rose petals, Robbie Williams angels was playing, the lights were dimmed the large arangements of tulips were perfectly arranged. My now wife was blown away, I asked her to sit down and proposed, she said YES! We wanted to take some photos of the ring so my wife could send them on but had no film I rang and asked if they could get film they said yes, but why don't we just lend you a digital camera and then we will send the photos on for you.

This may seem a bit petty on my behalf, except that we had a 9.00am flight to catch, so that 10 minutes was quite critical, having to scoff down our food at a quick pace.

It was almost reluctantly brought out and the service almost disappeared at this point. We had to virtually stop the snooty waiter (very LA attitude) and ask for service.

A Luke Mangan chardonnay (talking about keeping it in the family) was one of those terrible over-oaked yellow Hunter chardonnays that have destroyed the varietal.

This was a long stay for me - 24 nights after all of the extensions - and the quality persisted throughout. Since pretty much EVERYTHING worked as it should at this property I'm just going to go over some of the highlights; The check-in was great! I know, all they had to do was get you in the right room... but this was somehow a cut above. I was met the Hilton Honors Rep - she got me into the room I wanted without delay (at 6:30am!) and gave me a pleasant efficient run-down on everything I needed and nothing I didn't. She asked me a couple of questions about what I would like to do while in Sydney and handed me an envelope with \"goodies\". The goodies turned out to be truly useful! Not the usual touts and shills for touristic crap, rather there were drink coupons at high-end watering holes, a couple of film passes, and other useful items. She also quickly provided a great solution for internet access for the longer term. The bellman also had useful info on what was going on at the moment in the city. The concierge staff were truly superb - actually reminiscent of the concierge in 5 star European hotels. Each individual showed tremendous follow through and what I can only call pride at being affiliated with a very well run organization. My highest compliments must be reserved for the staff of the executive lounge. Those of us fortunate enough to be be able to utilize the lounges at various hotels around the world normally have very positive feelings towards the staff. The women (they were all women during my stay) who staffed the lounge at the Sydney Hilton were universally excellent. Throughout my stay they made me feel truly welcome every morning and evening that I visited the lounge. I also had a chance to observe how they dealt with all types of guests and if this isn't where Hilton does management training, it should. The location of this hotel was always great. Its right in the heart of everything - major department stores, theatre, cinema, food, drink, supermarkets are all within a few hundred meters. The room itself would be the only place for improvement in my estimation. The bed was excellent, modern flat panel lcd tv with plenty of choices, electronic controlled blackout shades are excellent. The only real issue was with the size of the bathroom. The shower stall and the vanity were on the small side. More on the slightly annoying side, certainly not a dealbreaker. I think I was in one of those \"special\" room categories that Hilton seems to be experimenting with lately. I had the opportunity to visit a different room type and both of the concerns were not an issue. Final note - There were a lot of deals offered on this property through various websites, but not on the Hilton site. I took the trouble to call the property directly and they matched the best deal I found.

The room was superb, stylishly appointed and in some hotels would be sold as a junior suite. The whirpool bath was a centrepiece and was a joy. The bed was very comfortable and my partner needed different pillows which were delivered within minutes. We had an upgrade so had use of the business lounge on floor 36 where snacks and drinks are provided free of charge. We went up there on the second evening but were told it was full (everyone tucking into the freebies!) However no problem as the more than obliging hostess gave us a voucher to have a drink in the swanky Marble Bar downstairs. The gesture was appreciated although the bar was a bit lively with the after work crowd on a friday evening. Breakfast was first class. Breads, pastries, fruit, juices, smoothies, bacon , sausages, pancakes, miso soup, you name it it was available. The staff at breakfast could not have been more helpful and friendly. Overall we found the Hilton Sydney to be a genuine 5 Star Hotel. It had a really good buzz/vibe about it. I think that is down to the well trained, highly motivated and friendly staff and have no hesitation in recommending this hotel", "Date": "July 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington", "Title": "\u201cvery good\u201d", "Author": "zalhazmi", "ReviewID": "UR35211360", "Content": "Nice rooms good view very nice breakfast high speed internet clean rooms", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cModern and you can't beat the location\u201d", "Author": "MrDBP", "ReviewID": "UR34977931", "Content": "I've stayed here a lot but not since it's refurbishment and I was impressed.

The bed was comfortable in the extreme, as were - a big factor - the pillows. The location of the hotel is fantastic, being opposite the wonderful Queen Victoria centre containing some superb shops and also easy walking distance down to the Quay and the Opera House. The only disappointment came with the in-room tea and coffee making products. There was no fresh milk in the fridge and so you need to phone down for that. It took ages to arrive, and then it was simply a cup of milk, when I had asked for a jug, which made it very difficult to pour. The same thing happened the next morning - we received a glass of milk instead of a small jug, with the consequent spilling of milk onto the bench. Also, ad this really surprised me, the coffee was just simply those skinny sticks of Nescafe, not quite what I would have expected in a Hilton.

We decided to stay here after contacting the hotel directly and being offered a fantastic rate. They were running a special offering rooms at half price and including a free breakfast. As per other reviews, the standard rooms here are very compact so we decided to stay in a relaxation room which would hopefully offer more space. We checked in early on a Saturday morning and our room wasn't ready as expected. When we did return at check in time we were greeted by a bottle of sparkling wine and a platter of choc dipped strawberries - what a great start! I had organised a separate fridge when we checked in (to overcome the annoying auto-charge mini bar fridge) and this was plugged in and cool when we arrived. Our room was 3826 and was next to a fire exit and a service room so was generally very quite. The only complaint I had of our whole stay was that some hallway noise did come into the room (I was glad we weren't on a busy floor). The room had a good sized bathroom with spa bath, jet shower and LCD tv. The whole room was very open-plan and was very clean and comfortable. The main area had a 42\" plasma and very comfy king bed (proper one - not two singles). Our rate included access to the club lounge which was very pleasant and we enjoyed drinks, canapes and free internet access here. We didn't have breakfast here as the rate included it in the main restaurant Glass. As other reviewers have mentioned, this breakfast is amazing. The key points I enjoyed were proper espresso, juice bar, cooked food to order and the \"bakery\". It is simply the best buffet breakfast available and makes for a great start to the day. The cafe in the lobby of the hotel \"Cino\" makes great coffee and has some excellent snacks as well. We also had room service one night that was well above average. We found all of the staff exceptionly friendly (especially those in the club lounge) and there was always a lot going on in the hotel which made for a great atmosphere. The location I think is perfect for accessing all of the main highlights of Sydney - very central and right next to the train and monorail station. In summary, I would say if you can get a good rate, there is no better central hotel to stay at. Also, book the larger relaxation room over the standard or club ones as they are far more comfortable. It pays to ring (or email) around as I found there is pretty fierce competiton between the hotels at the moment. I have stayed at the Westin, Sheraton, Radisson, Marriot Harbour, Swissotel and Intercontinental in the CBD and this would rate as the best (at the half price rate). If you had to pay full price (over $500) then I would say the Sheraton or Swissotel is still a better option.

Check in was very speedy and the staff were most amenable and helpful. The room was not enormous but most adequate- very nice bathroom with bath and shower, good toiletries (as always with the Hilton), in room safe, the beds were really singles(not king singles in size) but were comfortable. The windows had blinds which were operated using switches beside the bed closest to the window as well as having sliding screens which covered the windows to reduce sunlight or to give privacy. All very nice and tasteful. There was also a very comfortable sofa as well as glass desk, leather chair and all the normal things one expects from the Hilton. Decided to eat in one night and the meal was delivered on a dining table, which had collapsible sides (which could be brought up to make the table round). The food was stored in a small warming oven under the table- food was excellent, service also- well done!!!. Breakfast was excellent- very good selection and if you could not see what you wanted you could ask the chefs - the staff in the Brasserie were unobtrusive but when you needed them they were not far away- cappuccinos were excellent! The Breakfasts were so much better due to Wotif deal as I believe breakfasts are not cheap!

Valet parking was very efficient - both on arrival and departure. We were made to feel welcome right from our arrival. Our room (3520) was neat and clean, however, given the package was sold as a \"romantic\" one, the size of the bath is barely enough to fit one average person. As others have written in previous reviews, beware of the fridge. We're reluctant to pay over the top prices for drinks, and given Woolworths is a 2 minute walk away, it's not the sort of thing we would need the use of. The electronic system in the fridge is designed to keep people honest, however, it is rather embarrassing when you check out and have to explain to the reception staff that you've accidently taken things out of the fridge to make way for your own goods, not realising that you can't put those things back. To be fair, the staff at reception were very understanding, and in fact, said they get that a lot. Makes you wonder if they made a mistake installing this whizz-bang system. Bed size was good, the blinds keep a lot of light out of the room - nice when you want to sleep in. My last (and first) visit to the Zeta Bar was a really cool experience. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for this visit. Even though we had VIP passes, we were still treated the same as someone who'd walked off the street. The \"VIP\" therefore means, \"Free Entry before 9pm\". Within half an hour of our arrival, the place was full, and there was nowhere to sit unless you had the foresight to reserve a private booth. The smoking balcony was full of people, so if you're a smoker, you had to get really personal with other patrons to stand outside to smoke. The other gripe we had was the quality / dress code of those being permitted entry - the place very quickly felt like just another Sydney bar. One of the biggest disappointments was the noise - what seemed like stiletto's on tiles from about 0500 onwards. We could not determine where this noise was coming from, nor why it went on and on and on for hours. As it was the day we were to leave, we could hardly ask for another room, and without being able to determine without doubt where the noise was coming from (we suspect from the floor above), we couldn't do anything about it. Shame that we had a wonderful king-size bed, a very dark room, but were not able to sleep in due to this noise.

We arrived via car and when you park downstairs, it costs $35 so yeah! Valvet parking is $40 and it wasn't included in our initial price, so its already jumped up ot $200 now.. Foyer is ok although we took a while to be served. Upon checkin we tried to ask for an upgrade (free of course) but i think on our upgraded package, we just went to a higher floor. Got to our room and it was not bad.. Overall it was good. Main Pro: Liked the shutters that close the windows, pitch darkness! we came back from breakfast and closed it and feel asleep hard even though we were supposed to only have a nap coz it feels like its nightime and we nearly missed our checkout lol Main Con: Watch out of the fridge because they have sensors which when you take out a drink, then they charge you automatically.. if you want another fridge to put your own drinks and stuff, you have to request it, which was free anyway but just the hassle of getting another fridge coz the one they give you has sensors so yeah. i've never seen that from a hotel before so yeah Breakfast: well in our package it was 2 for 1 so we paid an extra $21 for the breakfast.

We were then told that they had no other rooms that night and we would have to wait until the following day to move. The following day every time we phoned us they promised that the room would be ready in 10 minutes. It eventually took an hour and a half. Thus 2 of our 3 day stay in this hotel were messed up.

Breakfast : We had breakfast at the Glass Brassiere once as the Executive Lounge was booked out. The choice of food was varied and the fresh juice bar being the best. Bars : The Hilton has the icon Marble Bar which is located on the lower basement floor. A fabulous place to have cocktails and listen to some live music. The Zeta Bar is located on the 4th floor and is fantastic winning numerous awards for being the best bar in Australia. However, the bar is only opened at 5pm which was a huge disappointment for us especially since we were entertaining overseas guests. There is another bar attached to the Glasshouse which is okay.

I chose it because 1 night was paid for by business and we decided to make a weekend of it and paid for 2 extra nights. The internet price was very reasonable compared to some other 5 star hotels. The hotel's had a recent makeover, a massive makeover apparently. Our room was smallish but very comfortable and what you'd expect from a Hilton hotel. The decor followed the current minimalist fashion - lots of white and glass everywhere, with a large timber bedhead to add some warmth. Lovely huge comfortable bed. But when will interior designers in this country be a little more adventurous and do something off the main page? There was a glass desk and chaise lounge so perhaps that was the design break out. The hotel service was excellent and the health club had great facilities, very spacious unlike some hotels which cram their gym into a pokey basement or other area. We enjoyed the pool which had saunas and steam baths and was not over fussy. We ate breakfast at the cafe in the foyer area, fine for coffee and muffins. Good helpful service there and nicely casual. The foyer is massive with about 3 mezzanines and a giant metal sculpture which twirled up through a couple of the mezzanine levels. My brother referred to it as the giant poo, and after that I was unable to regard it as anything else! It did bear a resemblance. Also I noticed a pleasant aroma wafting around the foyer, always there and always the same (and same as their Crabtree and Evelyn bathroom products) so I suppose the Hilton must have been pumping perfume through the vents somewhere. A couple of niggles. The telephone system, called Magic (for some reason, who knows why because it was infuriating not magic at all) made it complicated to call reception. You had to press a screen and half the time it didn't work properly. I didn't read the instruction booklet, but what's the point of a phone that you need an instruction book for? Dial 0 would've been good. The other thing was the TV/movie remote didn't work very well. This may've been because the batteries were running down, I don't know but we had a few frustrating moments trying to change and find channels. Oh and the elevator's numbering system!! It's hard to read the numbers which are laid out horizontally and were differently displayed in different lifts! Guests usually commented on it as they got in the lift, as it seemed to be a common problem finding the correct floor number! There was a panel with a vertical (more usual) layout but these were also hard to read and there was something about their layout which didn't flow. Apart from that we enjoyed our stay - great location in the centre of Sydney and close to transport and everything you'd want to visit.

Bar Staff did not make me aware of this when i walked in and were happy to take my money than made a group of 5 feel uncomfortable by telling us we had to leave. * Zeta bar and Marble bar seems to be externally managed by another group of people. To get access to these bars you have to exit the hotel and than line up with everyone else. I felt i was treated like a second class citizen, asking me for proof that i was staying at the hotel and cross examining me on what bars i go to in Sydney was disgraceful. I found out later that it was the manager's birthday and he had the entire place booked from 9pm onwards. Not sure what is more important, the Hilton's customers or and employees birthday. I ended up going to the Ivy down the road. *Went to book a massage and was told they were fully booked for the next 5 days, staff made no effort to fit us in. I assume they are managed by an external company too. * The beds feel like 2 single beds put together, seem cheap to me.

Despite being a high level Hilton HHonors member I've started moving my international business away from Hilton earlier this year due to a range of concerns. I thought I'd try the Hilton in Sydney on a recent business trip just to see if it was any better at home, especially after a multi-million dollar renovation. Short answer: NO. I think this hotel has targetted itself very much towards Asian visitors. The bed was very low and ROCK hard, much like what you'd invariably find in Singapore, Vietnam and other major Asian business destinations. And as a previous reviewer pointed out, the king size bed is two singles pushed together with a thin veneer of a cover over them. Hideously uncomfortable. Mine were slightly different heights to boot! The decor was very edgy and chic - glass desk, lots of odd angles and interesting features - but totally unintuitive. Two examples: 1. The blinds open with a push button that's on the bed head, but clearly most people can't find the button because there is a great deal of bending and lifting on the sides of the blinds where people have obviously tried to pry them up manually (take the hint, Hilton....). 2. The towels hang nowhere near the shower and you can't even rest them on the toilet because the shower opens the wrong way. So you have to leave them hanging across the room and then drip water all over the floor on your way, making for a slippery walk back. Bathmat you say? Nice idea. But the shower door is too low to open over the bathmat, so when you open it, the bathmat is pushed way under the sink. Ridiculous. My worst criticism is that the food was the most ridiculously priced I've ever seen in all my years of four star and above travel. A basic cooked room service breakfast is $40 (two small eggs, two pieces of toast, bacon, some cereal and fruit. A curry with rice is $35. Wedges - yes potato wedges, not wedges of pure gold - were $22 a bowl! I was mortified by the price, and didn't feel any better about it when I saw the quality. Made without an ounce of care . Tepid food slapped unlovingly on a plate. My travel is not greatly constrained by budget, but I do expect value for money and most certainly comfort from a four star international hotel chain. This hotel delivers a chic edgy look that photographs beautifully but does not offer a pleasant accommodation experience. This hotel should be ashamed to charge what it does.

It also has a red tourist bus stop immediately outside the main entrance so is ideal for that method of exploring the various city sites if you don't want to do too much walking.

The staff in this lounge are very friendly and go out of their way to make your stay as pleasurable as possible.

It had a variety of machines, a mat work area (for stretching etc.), group exercise studios and a pool suitable for laps, as well as large steam rooms. Unfortunately the jacuzzi was out of order when I stayed there. Buffet breakfast was included in our package (which was about $300) and there was a lot of variety on offer. I quite enjoyed one of their custard donuts. My friend and I were also happy that check-out was 12. Would I stay at this hotel again?

The rooms, while small, are ultra-modern, clean, and have good amenities. The standard ipod-compatible Hilton alarm clock is here, but so are LCD TV screens, a good minibar, ample desk / working space, and great bathroom amenities.

We were able watch the hustle & bustle of downtown Sydney as well as get some great jet-lag rest by blocking out the windows completely with the useful electric blinds. A big strength of this hotel is elite member access to the executive lounge (for HHonors members) - every morning there was a fantastic hot breakfast (eggs, sausages, toast, etc), including a wonderful display of fresh fruits, drinks and Australian jams. This was a big plus and avoided the hassle of us having to find breakfast places across Sydney every day (newspapers & free internet access are also available). Check-in and check-out were a breeze, the hotel staff seemed eager to assist and the hotel, located off two of Sydney's busiest streets was quiet, safe, and secure. The access to the lower-level LivingWell gym (which was fantastic, with a pool too) was very useful.

Overall it is a great hotel but I would probably not stay here again. Room: I have to agree with others that the design is slick and gives the best use of the space. The bathroom was nicely fitted out and it had nice modern features. Another big plus was the blinds made it really dark and if you were arriving from overseas and want to sleep during the day this would be no problem. However, the room is small and really only works for one person. I was upgraded to an executive room and have to say if I had not been I would not have been happy. I have satyed at the Westin before and even though last time it seemed a bit frayed I would return there as the rooms are much bigger and the bathroom is 10 times better. Staff: A nice touch when I arrived was the guy looked at my bags and then welcomed me by name. Check in for me was fast however on other days when I walked past reception the lines were quite long. Housekeeping was good, however we were surprised that turn down happened at 9pm and I heard housekeeping next door at 9am (as long as you have do not disturb should be ok). Then on final morning they vacummed the hall at around 10am which is fine if you don't plan on sleeping in but noting the number of do not disturb signs in other rooms we were surprised. Food: We had breakfast at Glass. The buffet was great however it is a bit odd that you get all your hot food but then order eggs or pancakes and this is delivered to your seat, so you if you want to combine then order and when the plate is served then go back to buffet. Also the service in here was not really attentive at all. It took a while to be seated and both times we went tables had to be cleared whislt we stood waiting. The atmosphere here is really nice and if they ironed out these issues it would have been excellent rather than good. Overall: In an excellent location downtown, great for shopping as across from QVB and other main shopping strip. Good if you were a business traveller staying alone.

A make up mirror in the bathroom would be a handy addition. 3. The water pressure in the shower could have been a bit stronger, with hotter water. The toilet didn't flush all that well, either. 4.

While I don't hate the hotel, I certainly don't recommend it, as there are dozens of little things they didn't get quite right. Before I start, I should mention that I attended a function at the hotel, but did not try any of the bars/restaurants/other facilities. My opinion is therefore about the room only. My room was a reasonable size, although definitely not large. The fitout was very clean, new and contemporary with lots of glass and steel (which isn't really my thing but many people do like this style). I was on the 41st floor with my windows facing directly at the Citigroup building. I must complain about the size of the tiny bathroom. Prior to refurbishment the room must have had a shower over bath. They have now installed a separate shower in addition to the bath, resulting in a cramped bathroom and ridiculously tiny vanity. There is very little room to place your own toiletries. And where is the hairdryer?? In a cupboard under the luggage rack in the hallway! Why do I have to search in obscure places for everything in this room? Another example is powerpoints. I made my tea and ironed my shirts in the midget bathroom as I couldn't find convenient powerpoints (I called to find out where they were later, and the operator kindly told me what I had to move so I could find them). The pillows here were absolutely horrible - I am never fussy about pillows at all, but these were truly dreadful. Having said this, there is a pillow menu, but I would prefer not to trouble myself to obtain decent pillows. I also prefer a genuine King bed rather than two doubles pushed together. The bedside telephone is way too far from the bed which is just silly. Lighting is bad! There are lots of feature lighting and a lamp - so you have to turn on about fifteen different lights and the room is still dark! Very trendy but not so functional. I need full length mirrors to examine my appearance before I leave the room, and in this room there are two. However both have furniture obscuring the bottom half! Importantly - my room had terrible mobile phone reception - forcing me to make telephone calls on the hotel phone (and as expected, my four short calls cost over $50). The blinds take way too long to open and close, and you have to hold the button the whole time. This is annoying. My request for a late checkout (which was granted) must not have been recorded as I was interrupted in my room TWICE by housekeeping wondering when I was leaving. My office authorised a credit card for my stay - which for some reason was only applied to the first night of my stay? I HATE when the billing isn't right. To me it's the little things that matter. Individually, none of the above are worth complaining about really, but when you have so many little things that aren't quite right, you don't enjoy your stay. Oh, and there was a fire alarm early in the morning, which I suppose can't be helped but it was a bit much after I had been annoyed so many times. Sydney has many fine 5-star hotels and I will try a different one next time.", "Date": "June 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA business hotel\u201d", "Author": "dbasha", "ReviewID": "UR5068856", "Content": "I spent 7 nights at the Hilton recently. As a business hotel, I had no serious complaints about the Hilton although the service was disappointingly average. The Hilton's location was good, and all the necessary facilities were present. However, I would not recommend the Hilton for couples/families on vacation. The rooms are very small and are a tight fit even for couples, let alone families. Furthermore, the prices at the Hilton are very steep, and meals can cost the earth. My take on the Hilton is that it is focussed on business travellers rather than tourists. If you are in Sydney on vacation, there are far better options for the price than the Hilton, such as the Shangri-La, the Four Seasons and the Intercontinental.", "Date": "May 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Christchuch, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cPure class\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5022673", "Content": "Pure Class is what defines this superbly rebuilt Hotel. It is obvious that the a great deal of thought and planning went into this property when you first walk into your room. The rooms are extremely well appointed and space maximised. The decor is striking and there exists a good mix of modern colours with natural wood. Being a very frequent traveller (predominantly for business but also for leisure) I am very particular about where I stay. I can safely say that the beds and pillows at the Sydney Hilton are second to none. Another defining point is the \"magic\" call button on your phone. There is no need for you to figure out which extension to dial for any of your in-room requests - one button and they're at your service. That alone is enough for me to be impressed however the Hotel is the complete package; with the Glass Restaurant and distinctly different bar choices (be sure to check out the Marble Bar in the basement).
