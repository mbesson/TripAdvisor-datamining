It was right on the beach and walking distance to the pier, bandstand, restaurants and shopping. We parked the car on Friday & did not move it until Monday. Now as to the hotel, we got a room on the 1st floor, the refridgerator made such a loud noise that we had to unplug it. The room smelled so bad that we had to request another room. The guy at the front desk was very helpful and gave us a room on the 3rd floor which was a suite. He said that he was going to get the additional charge waived. He also admitted that the rooms on the 1st floor did smell funny because we were so near the ocean. The 3rd floor was nice and bright. There was still a funny smell but not as bad as the 1st room. As to breakfast, it was food. The attendant was not very friendly. I stuck to the coffee and waffles because we prepared them ourselves. The price was very reasonable considering the location. By the way, they did not waive the additional charge because the clerk wrote down that the reason we were transferred to another room was because we claimed that the 1st room was too small, which was not true.

The location was great, right on the beach.

The rooms were large, clean and had everything we needed. We were a party of 14 and they managed to accommodate us well and, at our request, our 5 rooms were all on the same floor next to each other. I stayed in a suite which consisted of two large double beds, a sofa bed and lounge area. This provided great space, especially if you have young kids. My 2 year old cousin was able to run around. The other rooms had less space without the lounge area but was still great and each room came with a microwave, fridge and coffee making facilities. I walked pass one room that had a kitchen!! The staff were incredibly friendly and let us check in early to those rooms that were ready, at no extra cost. They were also helpful in directing us to good places for lunch. We tried to obtain a free upgrade to the honeymoon suite for my newly wedded uncle and aunty but they wouldn't allow it and only offered it with the standard charge. The hotel has a pool that faces the beach which was clean and quiet. The only down side was the lack of parasoles/umbrellas for my family who liked to sit in the shade. It was also very very windy by the beach but that's no fault of the hotel - it was mid April. The pool water was incredibly cold though and the jacuzzi was far too hot! Breakfast was included and provided hot beverages, muffins, bagels, spreads and hot food. I wasn't a fan of the hot breakfasts and their cereal was limited. However, the bagels and cream cheese was a hit with me! Opposite the hotel is Tailgaiters which provides food, pool tables, a bar and karaoke which was good entertainment for our big group and only a stumble away.

I must say this hotel was hands down much cleaner than another hotel we wasted 2 nights at down the road. Front desk was extremely kind and allowed us to reserve a room the night before. The room was huge, 2 rooms, kitchen and nicely remodeled including a flat screen. pool was clean, location was good. No complaints what so ever. Found us a new place in Daytona, will definately reccomend to family and friends.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hilton Head Island, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel, Awesome Deal ...much better than the chain hotels\u201d", "Author": "ragrissom", "ReviewID": "UR107384153", "Content": "Please read this review as it seems the previous reviews were for the hotel before a major restoration/new ownership. This hotel was an amazing deal! I stayed one night as i was passing through from Orlando, as I was at first was skeptical with the mixed reviews. I thought it was a gamble at first but the GM was very nice and said that if I didn't like the room he would refund my money. After getting to the room i was very happy as soon as i stepped inside. 79.00 for a queen with a side ocean view! There was a flat screen tv on the wall and the bedding/ mattress was brand new (i was told of a total redo of the property was done in Feb2011). Razor, spa soap, toothpaste included! I would recommend this property to anyone and hope that this review will serve as a basis for someone looking into this property! I am a manager myself so my attention to detail is very high!

I went to unload my items to the room, my husband tipped a valet to move the vehicle to an appropriate area. Later the valet brought us our keys, he had moved our vehicle to a front row (not blocking any vehicles) I asked him if we needed to move it again to the road if it opens up, and he said \"No, you are all set there\" My vehicle then was towed in the night. It cost $125 cash to get my vehicle from the towing company. Of course no manager comes in before check-out. We waited and TRIED to talk to the manager who was extremely rude and could of cared less that his staff mis-led us twice (once at the front desk, and the valet) He wouldn't even listen and kept saying it was not his problem it was ours. He said we received a discount rate due to no parking to begin with?!?! I tried asking him how would I know what his \"normal\" rate is, I was quoted a price and that's what I was charged. He said we tried scamming the by paying off the valet??? It's policy to tip a valet, they also have a sign posted in the lobby to give your keys to the valet, my husband pointed out these signs that are posted all over their lobby, and this EXTREMELY unprofessional manger became loud and aggressive and said he was telling us to leave now, so we are trespassing and asked \"Do you want me to call the police?\" We said yes actually, we feel we're being scammed. He turned his back and went into his office cubby and wouldn't come out. He was rude and unprofessional the entire time.
