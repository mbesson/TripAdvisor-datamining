We stayed one night at the 3 star side of the Westcord Art Hotel. We booked an extra large, \"Quadruple Deluxe Family Room.\" A picture on the hotel's website led me to believe there would be two queen size beds separated by a wall. In reality, this was a small room, with two twin size beds pushed together and a rather uncomfortable fold up couch bed. A person had to turn sideways to pass between the two beds. For the money we could have done much better. This hotel is clean enough, but there was absolutely nothing \"Deluxe\" about it. If you are American, expect the same type of accommodations as you find at a big chain motel off a major interstate exit. The best thing about the Westcord Art Hotel were the employees, who were all very friendly and helpful.

My first impression when arriving at reception was although greeted in a semi-warm fashion, I was given no information regarding services offered by hotel (metro/bus cards, etc), it's only by listening in on another guest being checked in that I pointed it out to the person who by this point had bid me farewell. On getting into my room, the mini bar was locked (I was not given any info when checking in about the mini bar). I phoned reception and was told I had to leave a 100 euro deposit - fine. This should have been explained on check in. I pointed out that you have my card registered - the mini bar was unlocked. Although first impressed by the aesthetics and look of the hotel, on closer inspection I noted that there were burn holes in the day bed, stained chair and chipped moveable table. My bed (twin singles) was extremely uncomfortable (too soft) and had two small single duvets instead of a double. I could not sleep on the bed - it caused back pain, and had to resort to sleeping on the day bed at night. On my last night the mini bar was locked. I phoned reception, who told me I had exceeded my deposit. I told them TWO cards were registered. They told me they didn't have any cards registered - this is an untruth. I found this extremely unprofessional - that I was not offered a satisfactory resolution. The staff were sullen, particularly in the braissarie.

She was extremely rude and conversed with a colleuge in Dutch whilst I stood there. Nevertheless, she booked a taxi for me when I asked and paid less than I had when I travelled from Schipol. The room was great, very clean and nice, and had a great stay. The aircon didn't work however and it was so ridiculously warm all the time. My only other complaint! Oh and, there's no way you're getting cold water out of those taps, all the water was tepid or scalding. I ate in the restaurant twice, and both times I was extremely impressed.

While a little inconvenient time wise (waiting for buses into city central) well worth the inconvienence. A new hotel, it is exceptionally clean, modern, roomy, comfy and overall very nice place. Room made up beautifully every day. Nice to have full tub to soak in after a long day of sight seeing. Pricey mini fridge in room, electroncially set - tell front desk you want to use it for your own supplies so you will not be charged if you remove something - they are happy to do this. Albert Heijn food store two bus stops up towards city center. Two city pools and park out back of the hotel for your use, are a pleasant and refreshing plus! Railyard in back of hotel never an issue - very quite place. Short bus ride to train station(s) City Central and Sloterdijk (sp). From airport during the day, take Central Station train and get off at Sloterdijk Amsterdam, go out front and take bus 48 - it stops right in front of hotel and is only a short, 10 min. ride. Make sure you check bus schedule if you have early flight home - weekend buses run later and longer between buses - taxi fare from hotel to train station 10.50 euros. Nothing much around this hotel, restaurant pretty pricey, outdoor bar nice - very quite location - would not suggest for young partying crowd that would be crawling back to theirs rooms late at night - lol - it takes some naviagting to get to the bus in the evening and some time to get back to the hotel, but if you are a little more reserved or have kids with you, and dont mind waiting on a bus once in a while - this place is a comfortable, affordable stay! Free wi-fi in room - what a plus - you must buy a pay card to use the internet in the lobby - we brought our laptop, For those that need something negative - yes, the doors do shut loudly - they did vacuum the hallways a little earlier than we would have liked them to one morning - but they did respect our do not disturb signs, and the modern design of the bathroom sinks reminds me of stainless steel prison sinks - there,,, Had wonderful trip - make sure you take short train ride out to Haarlem and to the beach - Van Gogh Museum a must to really get an insight into his short life as a painter - very interesting. Enjoy the city parks, museums and a local brew at any of the outdoor cafes along the canals - found Amsterdam to be very laid back and to be very beautiful, comfortable and friendly! Red light district a cultural must-see - very surreal, very safe, actually interesting, just very strange! You see all kinds wandering the district including many families and many, many tours during the hours of 8 and 10pm - Randy Roys Red light tour, , while we had to hoof it after our guide Ki-ki, who is quick-quick - was quite fun and entertaining!

We rented bikes for the weekend to fit in like all the other Amsterdamers. It was amazing. I think everyone in Amsterdam rides a bike. We rode along the canals and went to dinner and the museums on our bikes. It was so romantic. Our bike ride each way to the hotel was....9 minutes.

I was in Amsterdam for work, alone, so I had made reservations for a single room. I was given room 601 on the 6th floor which was really tiny, similar to hotel rooms in Paris. However, it was very clean, had a mini-bar, a safe-box, nice, modern bathroom and air conditioning. The best thing about this hotel, especially if you are on a work trip, is that it has FREE WIRELESS INTERNET. This way you can stay connected all the time without going back home with a huge 3G internet bill. However, my room had one problem. It was placed right next to the entry door to the 6th floor. This meant that I could only sleep until the first guest on the 6th floor woke up. Why? Because when someone opened the door in the morning to head for the elevator, it would close with a big slam that shook the walls of my room! A few minutes later, I could hear the cleaning maids knocking on each door and saying: \"Room service\"! All this would start from 7:30, 8:00am! In my case, it wasn't really a big problem because I intented to wake up at around 8:30 - 9:00am anyways, but if you like to sleep til late, then you will have a nightmare, at least in the rooms which are placed next to the entry doors of each floor! The hot buffet breakfast was served in a nice saloon near the reception. It was decent and I had nothing to complain about. The \"Tulip Art Hotel\" is not located in the center of Amsterdam, but getting there is absolutely no problem. From Amsterdam's \"Centraal Station\" you can take two different busses that would get you to the hotel after a 12-15 minutes ride. I'd recommend bus number 48. You have to get off at the station \"Hempoint\" which is exactly in front of the hotel. Another option would be bus number 22. If you take this one, you have to get off at the station \"Koogstraat\", walk back to where the bus turned left and go in the opposite direction of the gas station for 3 minutes. One interesting detail is that if you want to simply open the mini-bar in your room you have to leave a 100 euros deposit at the reception. I did this since I wanted to keep the water I bought from the city cool and fresh. Of course, I was given my 100 euros back when I checked out. In conclusion, \"Tulip Art\" is a decent hotel, especially if you are travelling alone on a work trip. However, if I went back to Amsterdam for fun, I'd probably stay in another hotel, closer to the city center and the action.", "Date": "June 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Property\u201d", "Author": "Hotel_traveller32", "ReviewID": "UR14502553", "Content": "Wow. what a good little hotel.

The hotel is located about a 10 minute bus ride west of the Centraal Station in a residential and semi-industrial area. A rail barn is located behind the hotel, but the area is clean and quiet. I left the window open in my room at night and really didn't hear much train noise. If you take the train to Centraal Station from Schiphol Airport you will pass the hotel (left side of the train) approximately four minutes before arriving at the Centraal Station. The Tulip Inn is connected to the Golden Tulip Art hotel. It appears both hotels are run by the same management as they share a front desk. Based upon the brochures in the lobby, it appears the Golden Tulip has a more \"upscale\" product with larger rooms and better amenities. Nevertheless, I found my room at the Tulip INN to be quite satisfactory. The front office staff were very pleasant and efficient and were more than willing to assist with questions, recommendations and directions. The room was a comfortable size for a European hotel in the mid $$$ price range. I paid US$101 (inclusive of all taxes and fees) per night on Hotels.com. The room was spotless, the linens crisp and clean, and the bathroom amenities were nice. The hotel offers a full breakfast for 15 Euro in the restaurant. I did not experience the breakfast as I thought this was much too expensive. Overall I had a very comfortable stay and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't want to pay the exorbitant rates of a \"downtown\" Amsterdam hotel or the overpriced mid-range hotels that often have poor quality rooms. Believe me, I know as I've stayed in several of these hotels! DIRECTIONS TO THE HOTEL (by bus): From CENTRAAL STATION: Walk out the main doors of the station towards the Damrak. Look for the \"HOTEL VICTORIA\" sign. It's located directly in front of the train station at the intersection of Damrak and Prins Hendrik Kade. Walk to the intersection BUT DON'T CROSS THE STREET! Turn right and walk about 75 yards. You will find a bus shelter there, directly in front of a kiosk for the Holland International canal cruise company. Wait for bus number 48. It runs every fifteen minutes from 0600-2000 M-Su and every thirty minutes thereafter until about 2400 hours. You will alight from the bus at the stop designated \"HEMPOINT\". The bus stop is directly in front of the hotel. Goto the GVB (public transit) website: http://www.gvb.nl/english/travellers/timetables/Pages/vertrektijden.aspx and select \"Timetable by Line\", then click on Line 48. I suggest stopping by the GVB office directly in front of the railway station and purchasing a 24/48/72/96 hour transit pass that is good on busses, trams and the metro. The pass is a good deal at Euro 7.00 / 11.50 / 14.50 / 17.50, otherwise the single ride bus fare is Euro 2.40. An alternative way to get to the hotel from the airport is via the airport shuttle which costs Euro 12.00 one-way or 19.00 return.
