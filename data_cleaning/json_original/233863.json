I've seen bigger selections but all the usual items are available, even a 'make your own waffle' machine. The hotel bar seemed a bit pricey, but there's a bar directly across the street which opens late (although it can get a little smoky in there). The nearest tube station (Wittenbergplatz) is only 200m from the hotel, and is probably the best way to get around the city. There are single trip, day/multi-day and group tickets available so do your research. Another 50m and you're outside the KaDeWe (advertised as Germany's biggest department store). Well worth a look. There are many other shops along this road too, and the Xmas market and lights made for a pleasant sight after dark. The Europa centre is an amiable shopping mall; the basement holds a large Irish bar with nightly live music, though their prices are on the high side.

When we arrived at the Ambassador Hotel, it was unseasonably warm in Berlin, highs in the mid 80s and very humid. The staff was very friendly and notified us that our room had been upgraded from a standard room, which we had booked through expedia, to a comfort room (minus the privilege of the key to the floor fridge, which contained gas water, juice, and beer, and could be attained for 10 euro per day if we wanted). Upon arriving in the room, it was unbearably hot. We quickly learned that there was no air conditioning and were utterly astounded by the fact that a hotel could exist in 2010, charge these rates, portray such a high and trendy image, and lack the simple commodity of air conditioning. We were only given one very small fan to gain air from the window, but attained a second one by asking a different reception employee. The room was extremely dated, as was the whole hotel in general, it seemed that nothing had been fully updated since first construction, aside from several inadequate upgrades that did not provide much comfort to the guests. On our third day, the pipe connecting the toilet to the water tank was somehow disconnected, and as soon as the toilet flushed, water gushed into our bathroom and quickly flooded onto the carpet. The staff, though unconcerned, quickly moved us to another room on the same floor. After reading the reviews on tripadvisor which absolutely raved about the hotel's breakfast, we really looked forward to our first morning meal. One man here went so far as calling it a \"breakfast paradise\". We quickly realized that this man had a very warped view of \"paradise\", and found the breakfast to be mediocre at best. The free wireless internet was very spotty, and only properly worked about 50% of the time we tried to use it. The reviews about the location of this hotel was a main reason we chose it, but the location is only desirable if you are traveling to Berlin to shop, as it is near many stores. If you want to sightsee, do not stay here! Though the U-Bahn metro station is very nearby, it takes about 20 minutes, and a transfer or two to reach many of the tourist sights.

This hotel doesn\u2019t pull any punches but merely \u201cdoes what it says on the tin.\u201d We arrived late Thursday evening and were ushered to our \u201cstandard double room\u201d only to find that it was actually a twin room. This coupled with the fact that the room was boiling hot and lacked air conditioning hardly made for a good first impression. After a rather sweaty night\u2019s sleep I approached the concierge to enquire about changing rooms. They were only to happy to show me another room, which for an extra 15 euros per night gave me a double bed, a larger bathroom, bathrobes, a much needed fan and access to the complimentary drinks fridge in the hall. I duly accepted and it proved to be well worth the dosh. Breakfast was a hot/cold buffet open from 7-11am and was perfectly acceptable although a little tedious by the third day. The staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and spoke superb English. Location wise the Ambassador hotel isn\u2019t great. It\u2019s situated near to the Zoologischer Garten station (similar to London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross) and isn\u2019t really near the Mitte (the hub of Berlin life). This of course meant taking public transport which as you\u2019d expect, is extremely punctual and efficient.

But we were surprised, the hotel is simple but nicely done (you don't need to spend much money to make something nice). The rooms are big for a 3 star hotel (certainly compared to a 5 star hotel like Kempinski) and are in a good condition. The only disadvantage is that when it is really hot , it can be very hot in the room because we didn't have airco (I don't know about other rooms). Breakfast was the biggest surprise. This can beat breakfasts in many 5 star hotels! Lots of choice, make your own pancakes, champaign, etc. We liked the variety of the people (compared to some other hotels) and in combination with the low price, the excellent breakfast and the central location, I would say 'check it out'.", "Date": "August 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Desert, California", "Title": "\u201cNice clean room but not very nice staff\u201d", "Author": "MichaelPD", "ReviewID": "UR8348538", "Content": "The hotel was typical business class Good: Great buffet and restaurant and good service/staff at the restaurant.

I have only good things to say about the hotel (and the lovely city of Berlin - but thats somehow irrelevant I guess :-) First of all I got a great price of 72 euros/per night for a single room. My other options started at about 100 e+ and I seriously doubt they were any better. The location of the hotel is almost perfect. Its about 100m from a central U-bahn station (Wittenberg Platz) which serve 4 lines! The 'platz' itself is very nice and spacious with 4 'imbis' ( wurst stalls) at its 4 corners. I had a delicious curry-wurst every night on my way back to the hotel! The KaDeWe store is at the side of the square and Kurfurstendam with its loads of shops begins just 500m away. So, the location is very central, with very easy U-Bahn access and some sights right at your doorstep, like the KaDeWe and the Ruins of the bombarded church (cant remember the name right now). Also do try the wurst in the imbis you meet when exiting the station and going to the hotel! The room was very spacious (for european standards at least). It had a king size bed ( I guess it was really a double-bed ), it was very clean, had a mini-bar, big screen TV ( not the usual 14\"), nice ambient lighting, a sparkling clean bathroom with excellent shower water presure. One thing that I ve never met before was the fact that it had double doors! There was an outer standard door with the lock and then another one with no lock. The double doors worked very well in blocking noise from the hallways. I really liked that feature. The only thing missing from the room was air-conditioning. I think there are ACs in the more premium rooms, but mine being a basic standard one, lacked it. However that didnt turn out to be much of a problem since the weather was cool enough, even in the middle of August, that I didnt really miss it at all. And I m someone who normally has the AC working 24/7 during the summer, but in Berlin there was no need for it. The staff was friendly enough and replied to my requests. The breakfast was good, although nothing really special. Overall it was a great experience and I ll defenitely stay there again, should I return to Berlin.", "Date": "March 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, BC", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "yvr1", "ReviewID": "UR6594289", "Content": "Spent three nights at the Ambassador.
