Always appreciate the cleanliness of rooms, the bright natural lighting, and the convenience. Reception staff were friendly and helpful, as always. This time I had breakfast in the hotel and was quite angry about the poor quality of service and mediocre array of food which made me feel ripped off. Where to start. I was dining alone, and the hostess/ server, a middle-aged woman with white-blonde hair looked me up and down in an unfriendly appraisal before seating me. Not a great start, so I thought I'd play it safe and minimize my interactions with serving staff by ordering the buffet continental breakfast. My de-caf coffee came right away (but without any cream or sugar). As for the buffet itself -poor selection compared with the Sutton Place down the street, which puts on a beautiful spread for the same price of $22.00 (give or take a dollar). I asked for the highly picked-over cheese plate to be refilled (different server this time) who told me angrily to wait. When I got up to get a second helping (the plates were literally the size of saucers), upon my return, the linens had been stripped off the table and my beverages gone. The initial server had assumed that I had left (without paying? didn't she care about the restaurant getting the money owed by a client?). I think this is more than just one problem employee -it speaks to an overall management issue here. My overall impression: haste and the appearance of business is stressed over quality and thoughtful service. I have a lot of respect for many aspects of the Wall Centre, so it pains me to be so negative, but the restaurant really needs to step up its game. The whole experience left such a bad overall impression -if I hadn't stayed at the hotel before I might vow never to return to the hotel at all.. As it stands, it will be years before I ever try their restaurant again. Hopefully by then the management will have changed.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New-York-Albany", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jim S", "ReviewID": "UR128130261", "Content": "Nice staff. clean rooms and great location....Very sanitary and pleasant.

Stroll along all the stores located on the Island and visit the absolutely great market. It is absolutely amazing what you can buy there concerning fruits and other offerings. The hotel even though it is very nice is divided up into a North and South Tower. I beleive the Swimming pool is in the North Tower and it is quite a walk to get there. The rooms are nice and clean and if you are on one of the top floors you should ask for a mountain view. The Club lounge where you can have a snack and a contiinental breakfast coluld be a lot better. In fact it is bordering on a low class lounge except for the view from the balcony.

On my first visit, I was fortunate to be placed in the swanky north tower with its modern boutique hotel design. This is the reason I rebooked at this Sheraton for a conference--the north tower was REALLY nice and we had an incredible view of the mountains and bay. On my more recent visit, however, we got bumped over to the south tower. I could be wrong, but the branding on the south tower (Wall Centre Hotel) seemed to indicate Sheraton acquired it from another company and expanded their operation? Regardless, the difference between the two towers was pretty drastic, with the south tower showing considerably more signs of wear. For one, our mattress was horrible--completely worn out with springs poking through the cloth. For $199 per night, I'm sorry, but you deserve a decent mattress. The manager should be ashamed to book rooms with mattresses that bad (room 3308 if interested). I will give the hotel credit for a central location near popular Davie and Robson Streets, but not at all near Canada Place or the convention center--a LONG walk. Certainly plenty of restaurants in the immediate area and a movie theatre and grocery as well right on Burrard Street. The hotel also deserves kudos for free Internet--most Sheratons in big cities would NOT give you free Internet, so this was appreciated. I think they made their money back in parking fees though at $40 per night. Ouch! At least it was easy to park and go without valet, and with in and out privileges. Our south tower room also had a refrigerator for drinks, which was nice. Unfortunately, the fridge in our room (3308) did not cool at all, but I suppose it might in other rooms? The room safe was also nice to have. Overall, not a bad hotel (friendly staff, detailed housekeeping), but make sure to confirm a room in the north tower if you can.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat business hotel option for Vancouver\u201d", "Author": "nymet4life", "ReviewID": "UR127805785", "Content": "I spent one night at the Sheraton Vancouver and thought it met all my expectations of a good business hotel.

We chose this location because it was centrally located downtown. Close to shops, seawall, trains and seabus. Everywhere we wanted to visit was just of walking distance. On our arrival we noticed we were not greeted like everyone else was. We looked like a very young couple, perhaps they thought we were a bunch of kids touring with our parents. We thought everyone working there was being rude and ignoring us. Our trip was short, and the second day we ate out for lunch and came back with leftovers which we thought would be nice to stick into the fridge and eat later on. Turns out our fridge was not working and there was something wrong with the wiring. We called the front desk to have it fixed and they said that they will have someone up within 20 mins. We agreed to this knowing that it would only take 30 mins tops but instead that person took a few hours to come up. This was a waste of a whole afternoon and since we were only there for a few days we were furious. We could have asked them to come after our walk, but instead we waited. So we explained to the hotel manager that our stay has not been easy since we lost a day of touring just waiting for the mechanic to come and everyone was very rude. She apologized for the inconvenience and gave us a room at a higher floor which was twice the size of ours with a really big bathroom and came with breakfast at the top floor with a great view of the city.

The hotel is two towers that are not connected as far as I could tell, so it was a little confusing when I was directed to my room across the plaza. The rooms were comfortable. The first room I was placed in had a broken outlet in the bathroom, and the hotel staff were very nice and prompt about switching my rooms. The second room was a little larger, too. There is a nice TV and huge windows with very nice views. The bed was cozy, very soft with two thick duvet covers on it. You felt as though you were in a cacoon when you snuggled into it! Bathroom was spacious, although the fixtures on our shower were strange, and I always felt like the water was either too hot or too cold. We had a meeting there, and it was VERY well-run. The meals were delicious, and the coffee/soda/teas available were plentiful. I really enjoyed the area they put us in for receptions, too. Overall, this was a very nice hotel for a business trip. It is farther from the convention center than I would've liked. Join Starwood Preferred Guest program to get on higher floor with better view.

The hotel offers two levels of wifi--one complimentary, with lower bandwidth, and one hi-speed for a fee. My hi-speed was supposedly included in my room rate. However, I was there for a conference, and because I was working needed to download a 4 gig file once. It took several (ok, closer to many) hours. I'm not sure yet what made it hi-speed...so, be aware that if you are going to pay the money for the hi-speed connection, that still may not give you everything you would want or need in terms of band-width. Also, the breakfast staff in the north tower restaurant seemed very harried when I went there to get breakfast once.

He was all smiley and helpful; I think other Front Office staff should take some lessons from him... The Front Office Supervisor who facilitated my check-in, however, did not smile at all when I arrived (This, I was really unimpressed). His eyes were fixated on the computer screen the entire time and didn't once look up until he handed over my room cards. It was definitely an awkward check-in! I also found it weird how I didn't have to sign any papers or confirm my departure during check-in...maybe that's just their operations or I'm not used to it. THE ROOM: I read descriptions of the 2-bedroom suite online and booked with great expectations; the reservation department even confirmed the room type I booked for (in which she described as a 2-bedroom executive suite with 1 king, 1 double, a kitchenette, a living space, and 2 bathrooms at $245.00+taxes CAD). However, I was a bit disappointed when I checked in only to find out I actually booked a Junior Family Suite and not the Executive 2-Bedroom that I was confirmed for. The Junior Family Suite was small and the area with the king bed was connected to the living room which I didn't like. I had some friends coming over from outside the city so I needed the 2 separate bedrooms. I called down to Front Desk/ Guest Services to confirm my booking and the agent informed me that since the reservations department is from Ontario, they cannot exactly confirm the exact room types as they don't work onsite the property. When asked whether I could upgrade to the room type I originally wanted, she sort of hesitated to give me an answer as she probably thought I wanted a complimentary upgrade. It didn't stop them from charging me $500.00+taxes CAD for the 2-Bedroom Suite but I didn't mind; I was tired, hungry, and had the money so I accepted the upgrade with the fee willingly. Regardless, I found their explanation regarding their reservations department quite absurd as they didn't even try to lighten the situation and apologize about the room type discrepancy. Overall, the room was nice with a beautiful view of the ocean -- lots of space, nice bathroom, wonderful floor-to-ceiling windows. THE BEDS: Sweet sleeper? I didn't have a good sleep because the beds and pillows were WAY TOO SOFT! I felt like Goldilocks stealing a nap from Mama Bears' bed because they were ridiculously uncomfortable. They literally didn't have a shape and it hurt my neck and back the entire night. BACK OF HOUSE STAFF: The housekeeper on the 30th floor was the friendliest of all staff - very nice and thoughtful.

My parents could only provide babysitting for 2 days, and one night. I had searched a fair bit for something that would spark our interests, provide some extras, and stretch our dollars. I came across the Sheraton Wall Center, in beautiful, close to home, and very diverse city of Vancouver. I managed to find the best price through booking through the Sheraton website specials. I choose the Club upgrade, king room, w/t a private, small balcony, floor to ceiling windows, flat screen t.v., very clean bedding, bathroom, room in general. (I had asked as a special request on the special request type box for exceptional cleanliness. As I have had problems with previous hotels in the past that I have not written a review as of yet, but will). Now this is the kicker; This room was on the 26th Floor on the special Club Floor. Yes, I had got an upgrade to a 26th floor king room price on the Club floor, with the Club Room serving h'orderves in early evening, and breakfast in the morning included. There is complementary coffee/tea/espresso( top of the line little machine), small jars of honey, jams, fine cheeses, fruit, meat appys, etc. My husband was so amazed at everything, and could not believe how wonderful it was, and how much we got for the price. The whole hotel was fantastic, layout, decor, marble, tile, wood, height(very high ceilings, and open). The pool, hot tub, extensive gym areas, sauna, and change rooms were exceptionally clean, well laid out. Towels, locks, and (hair dryers, woman's only) are provided.(Health Club, located on the ground level, and a short couple of steps outside to access) . The whole Health Club was decorated tropically with many tropical trees, and ice cube tiles, very nice ambiance overall. The Vida Spa is next door, and although I did not get the opportunity to use their services, they provided a $40.00 off coupon with our accommodation, and have extensive healing, and relaxation treatments available. The hotel property is very large for downtown Vancouver, and decorated quite well, and extensively with beautiful, exquisite winter lights around all the property's many trees. If your like us, and feel room service is not for you, then there is a Marketplace IGA down the street, where you can have a large selection of fresh, ready made entrees, snacks, groceries, essentials, etc.(Cheaper alternative, and more food choices). The ONLY thing I was not happy about was the over-height parking availability. We have a club van that is 16 ft long, and not much over height. However, it was a problem to know where to park. We parked in the front of the entrance underground with some Hummers. (there was ONLY 3 spots anywhere). Parking with tax was $40.00 from check-in, to check-out. I would suggest if you do not need your vehicle to explore out of city as we were, and are staying for more than 1 night, then either hire a limo with transfer from point A to B(different, cheaper rates, and you can relax, maybe with a drink or two, ask a limo company), taxi, sky-train, or bus. Overall, great experience, and would definitely go again!!!!!", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cAdvice from a native Vancouverite...stay here\u201d", "Author": "VancouverCanadian", "ReviewID": "UR120637506", "Content": "I live here and I have stayed at a few downtown hotels for conferences and other events.

Unfortunately the music player in my room was stuck on MAXIMUM volume and neither I, nor the maintenance tech, was able to fix it! I was disappointed to have no tunes during my stay. On another note, the pool and workout facility at this hotel appeared a bit of an afterthought due to the small size and odd location. When I asked front desk how to get to the pool etc, it was a rather convoluted route of ducking through hallways between conference rooms and storage areas..thankfully it was evening and there were no events on! It was the end of the day when we ventured down to the hot tub/pool, but the place was in disarray and badly needed to be cleaned. Other common areas, such as the lobby and restaurant, have been given much more attention with their updated decor, etc. However, if you are just stopping in for a quick stay, don't let this discourage you. Another thing I found a bit irritating was how early the attendants began slamming doors and cleaning on Sunday morning. It was definitely before 9am and it was far too loud to sleep! I thought it was decent that the parking attendants let me keep my car in the parkade for a few hours beyond checkout, so that I could finish my shopping without having to pay to park at another location.

Usually when you stay @ an hotel in a standard room, they make sure that room is nothing but standard. The bathroom was a decent size... My only complaints at the hotel is parking.

When I made the reservation I asked which tower we would be in and they said that they did not know. However, I later found out that family suites are only in the south tower, so they certainly could have saved me a lot of trouble by telling me which tower to go to! I also asked for a room high up; I was told that wouldn't be a problem. We were in one of the highest buildings in Vancouver, but they stuck us on the 6th floor. (I had booked 4 months in advance.) The room key must be used to get the elevator to stop at your floor. You can't go higher than your room key floor if you enter your room key into the elevator. It was so inconvenient to have to use your key every time you stepped in the elevator. Also, If somebody else stepped in when you did and entered their key first the elevator would pass the 6th floor before we could activate the 6th floor button. It was a huge pain being on a low floor! The view was obviously poor too. We paid for the room in advance because we were offered a special directly from Sheraton. I was happy to pay in advance to receive the special price until I noticed that my credit card was billed twice. I called Sheraton and was told that I would have to call the hotel directly. I didn't want to spend a lot of time on an international call, so I was pretty unhappy. However, I was able to email the hotel, and the manager emailed me back promptly. A couple more emails with the accounting manager resolved the problem, so I thought they did a good/quick job of taking care of that issue. However, anyone paying in advance should check his credit card bill to make sure the same mistake does not occur again. Overall, I liked the room. I just wished the people who answered the phone and the people at the front desk were more helpful and knew what they were talking about.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo", "Title": "\u201cterrible service and experience\u201d", "Author": "ap0k", "ReviewID": "UR117056057", "Content": "didn't have a good experience here. asked for an upgrade due to SPG status, and they mentioned that the hotel was full( which is fine, if that is true ). after checking into the room, we found used soap, towels and newspapers over the room. the front desk offered to change our room even though its supposedly \"full\". additionally, housekeeping only came twice during a five night stay( once after 7pm ). the mini bar fridges don't really work and after asking on how to use, they just said, put something inside and it will turn on. that clearly didn't work either. it would have been nice to get some shower gel at all, which they did not refill or have the entire stay. location-wise, its OK - near robson and shopping, but there are a ton of bums right outside the hotel. rooms are olderish in the non-new tower. very small and very worn. noise is fairly high at this hotel; we were probably 5 doors down from the elevator, but it was very easy to wake up in the middle of the night by elevator dings or people walking in the hallways. overall a very weak hotel and you're better off staying at the Westin or Fairmont.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, Canada", "Title": "\u201cHave stayed at this Hotel several times and have always enjoyed it\u201d", "Author": "Moosi_11", "ReviewID": "UR117041590", "Content": "Stayed August 11, 2011 for one night.

Vancouver is a very pricey destination. Hotels all charge a premium on rooms, meals, and parking. It's also a loud and busy city, so finding a respite away from that bustle and noise can be hard. The Sheraton offers exactly that escape. The Sheraton Wall Centre is a two-tower, massive property in the heart of downtown. Upon arrival, we had a quick and easy check-in. Valet parkers and bellmen gave us lots of offers of help. The front desk clerk gave us a great greeting, and a very warm welcome. Our Club Floor King room was on the 26th floor. The entire outside wall was windows, affording a spectacular view of the city and English Bay. The room layout was a bit tight, with a small sitting area featuring a love seat and desk/chair, mini-bar area and counter area, and the king bed in its own area behind a partial wall. Not a bad layout, but a bit tight for fitting in luggage and two people. Comfortable furniture, though, and having a fridge in the room was handy. The bed was comfortable, but so big that there wasn't room for a second nightstand. I will confess that the view made up for this, though. The bathroom was a luxurious marble enclave featuring double sinks and more floor space than most of the rest of our room! Our free breakfast in the Club Lounge was a bit disappointing (we've had better at other Sheraton properties) but adequate, and healthy. The evening hors d'oeuvres also included in our stay was much better, with both hot and cold snacks, water and soft drinks galore. The view from the south-facing lounge on the 25th floor was breathtaking. The business centre was helpful to have and easy to access, as it was also on this floor. Spiral stairs between the 26th and 25th floor in the Club Lounge/Business Centre were very convenient to have. Hotel staff were friendly and accommodating. Elevator service was slow but functional -- in a hotel this size, it can be much worse. The layout of the property was a bit confusing for accessing other parts of the hotel (ie the North Tower), and signage or clarification from staff would have been welcome. My only real complaint, however, would be that our valet parking was an exorbitant price, tallying over $44 per night on our final bill. The tags said $33, so who knows why it jumps another $11 on the final bill. Guess we should have self-parked, for $25 a night. For a downtown property, in bustling, expensive Vancouver, this hotel is a great option - and I'm surprised it doesn't rank higher as a result!", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat view.

As a Starwood Platinum member I was treated like a star by the front desk staff. I had booked a room at the north tower, but was given a room at the south tower instead. Initially I was a bit dissapointed based on the reviews I had read here, but the room they placed me in was on a high floor and had a balcony. My room had floor to ceiling windows that extended across roughly half of my room. I thought the room was great and this had to be one of the best views in the city. I couldn't have been happier. Housekeeping did an outstanding job throughout the week and the south tower club room was top notch. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in.

Here is some general information regarding the 2 buildings (north tower and south tower). I learned the south tower was built in 1994 and the north tower was built in 2001. The lobby of the north tower is amazing and the fitness center, spa, and restaurant are located in the north tower. All Sheraton guests have access to these features regardless of what tower they are staying at. I can only speak for the south tower, but I thought the rooms were great. Every room has a unique floor plan based on the building design. A select number of rooms have balconies on the south tower and there are no balcony rooms on the north tower. The north tower is half hotel and half residential (the lower floors are hotel rooms while the upper floors are residences). The south tower has a club room for elite members and I am assuming the north tower also has one. Self parking is $30 per night, but that seems fairly common for downtown Vancouver hotels. A tip to management - ditch the key card requirement for the elevators. I don't know how many times I rode that elevator up and down because my key would not work.

We knew this coming in that both rooms were at the same rate but felt that we could make better use of the family suite with the more beds. We called down to confirm our room and although they stated they provided the correct room, our confirmation sheet online told us differently. They offered to bring us a cot right away to accommodate all of us which came promptly 15 minutes later and he placed it in one of the bedrooms. It worked out even better since we had a larger livable suite. The cot was basically a twin size bed on a roller which was GREAT and COMFORTABLE. The suite was clean and spacious. We had a great view of the North Shore. The beds are always fantastic at Starwood Hotels. I have friends who may find them too squishy/soft but I think they are just perfect. The furniture in the suite wasn't super comfy (leather vinyl material) but it did the job. Housekeeping was often in the hallway when we left the room and greeted us kindly. The lobby has a really bizarre 'fresh' smell that I didn't care for. It was overwhelming each time we came into the lobby so beware to those who have a sensitive sense of smell. Check in was quick, check out was quick. Probably depends on the line up and how many they have on staff but when we were there, it was quite efficient. We dined at the restaurant for breakfast. The server was personable and encouraged us to have the buffet since we had a 50% off voucher. I regret selecting this since I didn't enjoy it too much but since I didn't have to pay the $30 full price, I didn't feel so bad. Warning: Coffee / Tea / Juice is a steep $5.00. What killed us the most in expenses was the parking. It was about $45/night... If you had a car, I would recommend parking in the lot since Vancouver parking else where can be sketchy (car theft) and quite expensive. You might as well spring for hotel parking due to convenience and suck up the cost. Another prewarning, it costs to make LOCAL calls at this hotel. I am not sure about other hotels, but I have never had to pay a dollar or more to make a phone call locally. If you make a lot of calls and don't want to go over on your calls, there are courtesy phones throughout the hotel. I would suggest you use these or your own cell phone if you have a good plan. The biggest perk of this hotel is really its location. Walking distance to Robson/Burrard for all your shopping needs, walking distance to Yaletown, and anywhere else you need to go in downtown is cab-able or a short distant drive. All in all, this hotel really tries to pinch every penny out of you for anything to want to do but I am sure its the same story for most Vancouver/big city hotels.

Checking in was relatively easy since we came on a Thursday but checking out on Saturday took too long. The nicest people were the valets and porters.

The bathroom was pretty large and had nice water pressure. The mattress was incredibly comfortable and made it hard to get out of bed in the morning. The valet parking was convenient but very expensive. We didn't have much of an option since parking the car yourself in the garage wasn't much cheaper.

The business center is located between the two towers and is a bit of a hike to get to. The room itself was very comfortable and had small windows that opened so we got some fresh air. We got a deal on the price because we booked over a month ahead of time. There are restaurants, a coffee shop, a spa, pool and fitness center on the premises but we didn't visit any of them. It's a very nice hotel but felt very large and impersonal at times. Probably better for business travelers than people on their honeymoon.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu", "Title": "\u201cBeds to die for.\u201d", "Author": "HawaiiTraveler86", "ReviewID": "UR115778928", "Content": "The night prior to an Alaskan cruise, we splurged and decided to stay in a 5 star hotel.

Firstly I was disillusioned with the price of hotels in Vancouver and with an average choice of hotels around the $250/nt price range I had to succumb to the Sheraton Wall. I should have trusted my hunch....it was terrible and it & the duty manager ruined the beginning of our stay in Vancouver. I had read extensively on TA that there were two towers - one renovated, one not. I had requested the renovated building when I made my reservation approx 1 month in advance. The day before our arrival I phoned again direct to the hotel & spoke to a really friendly girl to emphasize my request and blindly believed that my request might actually be heard. When we arrived at the hotel late on a Friday night I could tell by looking at the lobby or lack there-of that it wasn't going to be good. The vibe just wasn't right. As soon as we got out of the cab the 2 doormen couldn't even bring themselves to acknowledge our existence and the front office staff were dreary, unfriendly and unhelpful. When we asked where was the closest place that we could get a bite to eat the front office girl could barely point us in the right direction....hello, you're in a customer facing role - don't you have to/want to be helpful? When we arrived at the room it was just plain old fashioned, unappealing and clearly unrenovated apart from maybe a lick of new paint. When we ventured out for a bite to eat we stopped by the newer, sleeker Sheraton Wall tower and immediately you could tell that these 2 towers were worlds apart and we had been allocated the old, shoddy one. I was so disappointed that I phoned the front desk and spoke to the duty manager who was an Australian. She was exceptionally rude and would not even listen to me ... which made me really upset not to mention terribly disgruntled considering I was paying $250/nt for a terrible room and horrible service. I then phoned direct to SPG and spoke to a lovely girl in Dublin who was extremely apologetic and she cancelled our 2nd night's accommodation free and also offered to give us 5000 SPG points to apologise for the bad service we had received from the duty manager. To this day....almost 3 months later the points were never deposited which leaves a really bad taste in my mouth and has soured my desire to ever want to stay in a Sheraton again. We immediately went online and booked a room at the Fairmont Waterfront and it was a world above Sheraton Wall right from the beginning.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood business hotel, clean and convenient\u201d", "Author": "roadwarrior40_11", "ReviewID": "UR115469790", "Content": "This is a clean and convenient business hotel.

Key card had to be recoded twice during the 5 day stay. Clerk said cards are very sensitive and if kept near a magnet, they become demagnetized. Odd... my card was in my pants pocket and the problem occurred always on the same elevator! Staff were usually very courteous and helpful...front desk staff, everyone at the concierge desk and the housekeepers... and MOST of the valets. However, on one occasion we left our car with valet for parking & went to our room and saw that it was still not parked 30 minutes later. We made 2 calls to valet requesting that the car be parked and were told that they had been busy. I commented that I'd been watching and seen that 4 cars that cae in after hours had already been parked (several immediately) and ours was still there at the front. Considering that we were paying $45.00 daily for valet parking (plus tip), I expected the car would be parked right away! Room decor is light and airy and the beds and pillows are incredibly comfortable. However, there are only 2 chairs in the room, only 1 of which is semi-comfortable. The other is a straight back chair. I would have thought in a convention hotel that there would be an ergonomic chair at the desk. Housekeeping was generally good, although it was not until the 4th day that a pen and note pad were left in the room... this is usually standard in most hotels... even ones with much lower room rates. The mouth wash left with the other standard amenities in the bathroom is a nice touch as well as the robe in the closet. Hotel is close to Gastown and also within a couple of blocks of a large grocery store. Also a number of good restaurants are within walking distance.

An added bonus was a small refrigerator which I rarely find in North American hotels, and there's lots of accessible power points, so I wasn't crawling around the floor looking for a plug. It's a big hotel, but it didn't feel like a big hotel to me, never felt crowded and never had to wait too long for an elevator which often happens to other big hotels.

I was impressed with the option to decline the daily servicing of the room, in return for a $5 voucher to spend on food and beverages at the hotel. There's also a recycling bin in the room. But, on the flip side, the thing I didn't like was the use of disposal cups and stirrers, and the lack of even a spoon in the room. This is cultural, I know, but it's also an environmental issue - but I guess it's cheaper to provide throw away cups than to wash them up? And providing a couple of real spoons couldn't be too much to ask?

The only draw back is the 3rd tower is a residential building and the residence share the facilities so it can be busy in the pool area. The rooms are clean and upto date.

We set off everyday walking to our destination- Stanley Park, Granville Island, Yaletown, Robson Street, Chinatown, False Creek... anywhere we wanted to go we could walk to. We took the C-train in from the airport, and walked over to the hotel easily with our luggage. Certainly much cheaper than renting a car and paying the expensive parking rate when we probably never would have used the car during the trip. Our room was on the 24th floor of the North Tower. It had a nice view of the mountains, comfortable bed, etc... The bathtub is very shallow, but the shower is at a nice height. We did not use the health centre but did have a drink and dessert in the \"one\" lounge during our stay. It was a little pricy, but not excessively so. The hotel was VERY busy with a conference, but we never had to wait long for the elevator and our room was quiet. For us the rate, though expensive, was worth it due to the location more than any particular aspect of the individual rooms. There are tons of Starbucks, Tim Hortons etc... nearby so we always walked there for our breakfast, picked up something light from Urban Fare or Safeway for our lunches, and then enjoyed a great dinner at one of the nearby restaurants. One problem we had was with our tv. On one of the evenings we stayed, it was raining quite heavily outside so we decided to stay in and watch a pay-per-view movie. However, it wouldn't work. We called down to the front desk and they sent someone up. He tried and tried to fix it but couldn't. He went to get another part while we went to get a drink in the lounge and thought it would be fixed by the time we returned. It wasn't and by that time, it was going to be too late to watch a movie anyways so we ended up turning in early. My other issue was with the billing. I had purchased a pre-pay stay and was billed accordingly. However, I did make a long-distance phone call (at a very unreasonable rate of 18.25 for a less than 5 minute talk to Edmonton). When we received our bill in the morning, the charge had been reversed- I assumed this was the hotel attempting to make some compensation for the fact that we couldn't use the television. However, then about 4 days later, my credit card was charged for the phone call. I think that the bill should be more clear if they are in fact putting an additional charge through- I don't dispute the call, but the bill was very unclear.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay, Great Service\u201d", "Author": "GoneTrippn", "ReviewID": "UR108670233", "Content": "I really liked this location, so I'm not sure about some of the complaints.

The cons: The hotel has no decent restaurant.The Indigo restaurant is closed permanently it seems, (despite still being advertised on the website). The only restaurant is the seriously awful Cafe One. Aircon there is savage (even the table candle flames blow around inside a jar) and the atmosphere there is more like eating in an office. (There isn't any atmosphere). The restaurant decor is really dreary and not in the least warm and welcoming, The food is very average for big money (a $40 steak was well-done when medium rare was requested) and the vegetables went stone cold on a tepid plate in the aircon. There was a time when you were welcomed with some nice warm bread, corn bread and an oil and vinegar dip. Not any more. This explains why it is mostly empty unless there is a convention in town. In the rooms, the free wifi is slow and the premium wifi ($18.95 a day) is not much better. Speed tests show barely a third of the advertised speed.

Once upon a time they had a convenient little restaurant called Indigo on the ground floor of the South Block which was easy to get to, had great staff and a good, reasonably priced menu and wine list. It is still advertised on the web-site but it's actually now closed. Thanks for the misleading info Sheraton. Instead you have to go to a place called Cafe One, trekking way away across the site, with no signposts, to the North Block. It's probably quickest to go out in the pouring rain to find it. When you have found it, what a disappointment. It's a huge place with no diners, (not surprising), a very expensive and very limited wine list and the food is now very expensive but just about OK. Just what a working person needs. Its served on plates that get ice cold in the air con before you can finish the food. I had no spoon for my soup and the server filled up my glass with wine like it was a beer glass. No training on how to serve a $50 bottle of wine I guess.

A great perk was that we could forgo house keeping and we would receive a $5 voucher to the hotels restaurant, bar, Starbucks, or gift shop. We went for a swim in the pool on the first night there and enjoyed ourselves, the pool was crowded, but a fair size. A big plus about our room was that we were able to open the windows, which most hotels don't have. We were disappointed in a few areas of the hotel, one of the major ones being service. Throughout our stay we didn't see a single person at the concierge desk, every time we needed directions we either used our phones to look them up, or stood in line at the check in desk to get a map.

When our air conditioning did not seem to be cooling, the hotel sent two repairmen up immediately. They were very pleasant and fixed the air conditioning very quickly. They told us if there were any problems, just to call. Meanwhile, the front desk checked with us later, just to make sure it had been taken care of. Also, the hotel had a wheelchair that we could borrow for my mom to use.

Again, none of which were the slightest big deal; but all of them together -- and no, I am not typically a needy guest at all -- just grew very tiresome to deal with. Many of these were miscommunications, but many of them were also overly bureaucratic processes that the management could easily streamline if they did an analysis of how they do things, and how they could make things more efficient. I assume they could capitalize on some internal expertise from Starwood for this, as I haven't experienced the same issues at other Starwood properties.

The room was small but clean, the view beautiful. More closet space was definitely needed though, I don't know how people fit their winter jackets in there? We had to share the closet space with the ironing board, the safe, and a chest. Just not the quality you would expect from the Sheraton. The fridge hardly kept things cool and we only had water, yogurt and milk in there.

I ended up dumping an unopened 8pack yogurt and 3/4 carton of milk. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom clean.

However, I question how long it will stay in good shape given the problems we experienced. Although the staff we dealt with were always polite, I think the hotel itself is understaffed and, in particular, room cleaning was a problem area. We arrived on the day of a wedding we were attending. We had requested three rooms on the same floor. My parents (who arrived first) were advised by the hotel that there were three rooms reserved for us on the 26th floor. However when we arrived at 3:00, they put us on the 17th floor. When my brother and his family pulled in just behind us, they were told that they would be put on the 26th floor, but that the room wouldn't be ready until 5:00 -- not good sine the wedding was scheduled for 5:30. Ultimately, they were moved to the 8th floor. The rooms themselves were nice, well furnished and had great views. Ours was spacious enough to accommodate a crib (supplied by the hotel) for our two year old. The fridge in the room was questionable (turned to maximum it kept food cool but not cold) and the carpet felt damp in places. On our first morning, a mysterious slow drip appeared, coming from the door frame of the bathroom. Hotel maintenance staff investigated (responding promptly when we called) but were unable to identify the source. It stopped with time; I suspect it was either from an overflowing tub or toilet upstairs (yech). Issues like this make me question how well a hotel will age. Hotel cleaning staff stopped by at about 8:45 am to clean the room. Having been out late at a wedding, we asked them to come back later. They never returned. For an expensive hotel, I would have thought they would make a better effort to clean guests' rooms. Again, I think they were probably understaffed. Again, it makes me question how quickly this hotel will deteriorate. The pool and fitness room were good. In the rooms it says there is a charge for the fitness room, there was not. The fitness room staff were shaking their heads over that. Although the pool is essentially a lap pool, my children enjoyed it. It was shallow, varying from 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 feet in depth. The only real surprise in our stay came upon our departure. We were quoted a rate of $33 a day for parking -- expensive but it is downtown Vancouver. While that was the rate, with taxes, it came to $45 a day. While the taxes aren't the hotel's fault, they didn't provide a breakdown or explanation on the bill. It was only when I inquired that I learned that Vancouver charges a draconian parking tax. As a service business, it would make sense to provide either advance notice or a breakdown of the charges or both. Ultimately, I would say it was a nice place to stay. For the price, however, I think they should do better.

We were given a room on the 14th floor (so much for the \"pre-assigned\" comment from the morning front desk clerk) in the south tower. The bell hop who brought our bags to our room was very helpful. He phoned his friend to find out the name of a good mexican restaurant for us to eat at. There are two towers of available rooms. The north tower houses the main lobby, restaurant and has a grander feeling then the south tower. We chose to walk across the outside drive to the south tower( 1 minute walk) but if it was raining we could have taken the inside walkway. The south tower has a small lobby and concierge desk. Elevators require room cards to activate. Our room was very nice. It had two queen beds with quality bedding. There was internet available in the room and monitors + were also available on the third floor. Coffee in the room was Starbucks. The bathroom had been renovated with new granite counters and tile floors. The baseboards ( painted poorly)was the only cosmetic fault I could see.

The housekeeping room was right across from us so we heard the banging of the cart quite early as the staff started cleaning the empty rooms (about 8:30 am). Check out was smooth, done through the room TV. There was no opportunity for a late check out as the hotel was \"booked solid\".

When we got there they had us in a city view room. With all of the high rise towerrs near the hotel on the city side, I can't imagine there is much of a view in those rooms. Casino coupon books: We asked the concierge how to get to the casino and he proceeded to also give us coupon booklets for the casino. They're not anything that great, but each book has a $5 match bet for blackjack and a $5 free play for slots. On the latter coupon they actually give yoy $5 for you to use as you wish....not necessarily for slots. I;m sure the concierge has promotional tools for other attractions as well...we just didn't ask. Super secret tip of the day: Our room was next to the club lounge, which has free Wi-Fi. We were so close we actually got a free signal in our room. Beats paying $12 - $18 per day.

Add another $30 or so for Valet. I'll admit I haven't stayed in many Vancouver hotels, but I've only seen nickel and diming like this in the most touristy of areas (and even prime beachfront tourist traps on the Waikiki beach charge less). That said, we booked our room in advance through a travel website and were not given the option of choosing the type of room we wanted and ended up in a Double room with two small beds... for our romantic getaway option. Before we settled in, I politely went down to the front desk and asked if they had any rooms with a single King bed available. They couldn't answer, of course, until they looked up our room and our rate code, at which point they informed us that they did not. The manner they went about it was polite, but also quite obvious that the fact that we didn't pay full price played a role in the 'availability' of a suitable room. So we were left to either sleep separately, or share a tiny bed together in our room. The TV system is horrible. The TVs are decent flat panel televisions, but connected via an ancient analog hotel system. It has a basic menu system from the Hotel that allows you to view your bill, order some newer movies to watch (for $15 each), etc. At one point, our TV went unresponsive after sitting at the hotel menu for a while and when we went to change the channel we couldn't. So we called the front desk to ask about it and were told that there were some 'upgrades' being done that were causing this and to try again later. Odd. Well, to make the story short, we did some playing around and testing, and as far as we can tell, the hotel terminal system has some sort of timeout/screen saver, and if you sit at any of the official hotel menu screens it will eventually time out and go black and there is no way to get it back without turning off the TV for a while to let it reset. There were no upgrades happening and nothing changed after these 'upgrades' completed that evening. The front desk clerk basically lied because they knew their TV system was junk.

When we checked in, we were even told that a baby crib was built up in the room. But when we entered the room, there was no crib. It wasn't too bad, since we spontaniously brought our own travel crib, but the organisation just wasn't okay.

It was once renowned as the only North American city with 4 true 5 star hotels. The Sheraton fits into none of these, as many say it's bland. The North tower is new and contemporary, although odd bits like carpet are wearing down, the south tower has been out of date for ever. I stayed three months almost non stop at this hotel and the service was in the main, lousy. Still is. I was once in a south tower \"club\" room, frankly the north tower was still better. It had cracked coffee carafe, noisy plumbing, stains everywhere, the usual bath drains badly (always a problem here) etc etc. No one issue is a deal breaker, apart from, maybe, the rotten staff. The hotel gets a lot of tour buses through large Asian tour operators, and I feel much of their interest lies there. I stayed there last in August it was red hot, tropical for Vancouver, many things on there so many hotels were full. I could still get a room here without paying inflated \"city is full\" rates. Sheraton Platinum card holders - in 3 months of going there I never saw an upgraded room, never mind the best room in the house promise. If that's important, you may well be out of luck here. The staff at the front desk often sneer and laugh at the previous person just walking away. They also like to turn around and face the wall to snicker about people on the phone. If they do it to you call them on it - if I see them doing it to others I call them on it. They should really have other jobs... Nicest person there was one particular valet/bellman. We tipped him $20 all the time for being the only one not drawn into the misery of the other staff... and one older room maid with a German accent who was just lovely. I do keep going back - as I can get a good deal at this place and sometimes get in when others are full. So you can tell the better rate and location - these balance out what I know to expect. I always get the North Tower, even though there is no true \"Club\" rooms over there, the corner rooms are perhaps the best in the North side. If you're having a wedding or joining a cruise of a lifetime - don't stay here. If you get one snarky staff member or surly service, it will just detract from your day. The Hotel Vancouver has awesome staff, as does the Fairmont Waterfront, the Marriott Pinnacle is good, rates are stupid (but as low as $55 US in the off season on priceline.) The beds are nice, the rooms are generally quiet - street noise is blocked but hallways often noisy... Other than that great location, it's easy for much of \"tourist\" Vancouver - shops and restaurants always close by. If you can get a deal (140 Cdn or less before tax) it's probably worth it. There are plenty other hotels in the same category, but their rates are nuts. The other bonus for this place is that it's handy for Yaletown as well as the shopping district and one of my favourite sushi places is 5 mins walk. I am going here again this summer, I doubt it will ever change.... Just be aware what you are booking so you don't get surprises.

Our room upgrade included free breakfast, buffet style in a nice private area/room (hard to describe) that had two floors, more great views, and decent food and coffee. There were tvs and couches in there, it was like a private lounge, very nice. Location wasn't bad, have to walk a few blocks to get to the major points of interest, but still fairly central. I'm still little suprised about the blandness of the decor on the whole, but we had a comfortable stay our needs were met.

The hotel is very central to downtown so everthing is right there which is handy. It looks impressive from the outside but it is huge, therefore I feel although you got a professional and courteous service you lose the personal touch of a smaller establishment. The room was nice enough, I E-mailed ahead after reading reviews on here and requested a high floored room (for a better view) in the North tower. (there are North and South towers, the North is newer and the rooms are more modern and nice). I got a response an hour later to confirm this was all sorted, which was impressive. If you don't already have a SPG (starwood preferred group) card to collect points on then you can ask for one for free at the desk. This entitles you to discounted rooms at numerous hotel chains, or room upgrades etc. If you choose to not have your room cleaned then you get a bonus of 500 points per time. As I was there for an operation and therefore stuck in the room alot I didn't really want people in and out cleaning the room. So, I did it myself most of the time and got the points credited at the end of the stay!! The room itself was nice. I was in a standard King room. It depends what kind of budget you are on and what type of room you are after but they offer quite a range. Obviously there will be different prices for the better rooms. Oh, there is a starbucks on the lower ground floor open from 0530 hours!! (you won't be devoid of Starbucks' though, there is one on every street, i'm not joking!!). The bed was very comfortable and the mattress was nice and soft. There was a flat screen TV in the rooms but be careful not to order a film by accident on the remote control as once you switch the TV on it opens up on the film ordering screen! The bathroom was adequately sized with marble work surfaces, it was nice. The cost of the room service menu was very high and the breakfast costs for the buffet were quite high also, therefore i didn't utilise this service. There are many local restaurants/cafes in the immediate vicinity though so you won't go hungry. There is also a cinema and the Davie village just a short walk away. There are reviews on here that I read before my stay about the noise from the street and the hospital that was opposite. I have to say that although i was on the 21st floor there was a fair bit of noise from outside and other rooms, the walls are very thin and you can hear quite a lot of stomping about from upstairs so hopefully you will have quieter neighbours than i did!! You will hear a lot of ambulance and police sirens from the opposite hospital.............but i guess if you book opposite a hospital then thats to be expected??!!!?!! All in all I would return here if I went back to Vancouver, but I might try somewhere else next time as there are so many hotels locally and most would probably be a lot cheaper..................... Oh, one more thing.....there is internet in the rooms but its not free you have to pay and its about $10 per day via a wire thats in the room. You can use the internet for free in the lounge which is situated in the corridor between the North and South towers but its only free for 30 minutes. If you log on via your own laptop then you can log on for up to 2 hours for free. I think with the price of the rooms for this hotel they should supply free wi-fi in the rooms. Most of the other much cheaper hotels in Vancouver offer this free in room service, that was my main gripe.........", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North America", "Title": "\u201cLooking forward to my next visit\u201d", "Author": "Travellinggirl2010", "ReviewID": "UR54178978", "Content": "I've stayed here a few times before and my reaction is the same - awesome!!

A safe is an extra I appreciated, and the fast internet (the basic package at $10:95 for 24 hours) was good for work. Only problem was the lack of a proper chair at the desk, only a chair with 4 legs, and rather uncomfortable. The conference food was above average (it also wasn't chicken everyday). I had breakfast in the restaurant on the Sunday, and the continental brunch was good, though not cheap. There is an off licence (liquor store) in the other tower, and prices seem reasonable. I went to the small supermarket opposite and got some real milk for my coffee, and it was nice to have a small fridge to put it in. I swam every morning, the pool is OK for lengths, and there is a sauna and a good sized gym which appeared well equipped; all seemed well used by members as well as guests. The staff I encountered seemed polite and helpful. There were plenty of lifts so you never had to wait too long. The new train from the airport ($3.75 weekdays and $2.50 at weekends) is fantastic.

The underground parking was somewhat of a mystery as there were two P1's, one under the North Tower and one under the Pavillion. While we figured it out for ourselves, the guy on the front desk didn't seem to know that there were two P1's (separated by P2) He could only state that it was confusing and that maybe we were pushing the wrong button. We had to exit the parking garage and walk into the lobby of the North Tower with our luggage. It would have been so easy and economical for the front desk to have a map of the garage available. Whereas we decided to use the Trolley system to tour around Vancouver City and Stanley park we asked the lady on the lobby desk where to catch it. She directed us across the street to Century Plaza. As we were talking to the Doorman there, he turned us around in time for us to see the trolley passing on the other side(the Sheraton side) of the street.

An hour later, whereas the wine glasses had not arrived, she called the second time to cancel them. 15 minutes later, we were both napping as a knock came on the door. The two wine glasses had arrived. We reported all the maintenance issues on the first afternoon we were there. When we left 48 hrs later, the light fixture had been pushed back up but that's it. Upon complaining for the second time about these issues, we were told that these things happen. I find it hard to believe that all these things happened the day we got there.

The first visit consisted of 3 nights, and we were placed on the 12th floor of the North Tower. The floor-to-ceiling windows were nice, as was the bed, but the room was way too cramped for two people over 4 days/3 nights. We didn't have enough room in the closet for our coats and clothes (that dresser is TINY!), and we felt like we kept bumping into each other or the walls throughout our visit. The check-in person insisted that this was \"one of our nicest rooms,\" but while it's modern, the space issue didn't make it too nice for us in the long run. On our return trip from Vancouver Island, we were placed in the South Tower up in the 20s. We had a great view, but also could hear the sirens from the hospital across the street at all hours. The room itself was easily twice the size of our first room, but it was much older in style and decor. Still, the space made us feel a little more restful before returning home. We had issues with the concierge. First, we asked for a nice Italian restaurant recommendation for dinner, and our only caveat was that it be vegetarian friendly. The concierge looked at me, and she said, \"Well, there's really only one inexpensive place. The rest are all fine dining.\" Now, we had no preference of where the restaurant was. We were happy to take a bus, a cab, etc. But there's only ONE that she'd assume is acceptable for us? I was even more perturbed that she assumed we wanted something inexpensive. It's not like we're staying at the Best Western! So she sent us to Lombardo's, just a block away, and we had the worst experience. Hard pasta, soggy pizza, and pretty much a poor night overall. On our 4th day, we had rented a car to go to Vancouver Island. We carted our two large suitcases down to the concierge's station (we were directed by the North Tower front desk staff that we had to go to the South Tower for this) and asked for assistance calling Budget because they offer a free shuttle for pick-up and delivery (I even confirmed this by calling them the week before). Sadly enough, it was the same concierge: female, mid-40s, curly reddish hair, and a perpetual frown. She said curtly, \"Well. I don't think they offer that service.\" Um, no. My web confirmation says they do. And I called and they confirmed it! She agreed to call, did so, acted snotty to the Budget person, hung up, and said, \"They don't.\" Yeah. Ok. What do we do? She said we could keep the receipt and Budget would reimburse us. Sounds easy, and it was, but she could have been nicer about it. A smile and a little warmth really go a long way. Lastly, don't order food via room service. It's way overpriced and bland. The bar area is pretty much nonexistent. The Sheraton's big plus is location: not too far from all the hubbub of Robson, and also an easy walk/cab/bus to Kitsilano and even the West End.

This building and the rooms were clean and modern. Customer service was generally good, though there were a couple of days when they didn't deliver the morning newspaper. The room itself was well-maintained, with nice floor-to-ceiling windows and a good king size bed. The North Tower suffers from the same situation as modern condominiums; because the rooms are not shaped as a rectangle, you have strange and awkward room situations. The desk chair for this room was ergonomically poor -- (it's a standard room chair) -- I've seen better desk chairs in Holiday Inns. That was a disappointment, as was the bright idea to enclose the bar fridge in a tight enclosed closet -- that meant that there was no space for the heat to escape, which meant that the bar fridge was never cold. There was also a really annoying closet light that automatically flicked on and off whenever it felt like it. Parking is a standard ~$25 per night, which is about what you'd pay for any downtown hotel. Standard Internet is $12 per night. All that said, I would choose this hotel again, because Starwood points are fantastic, and because this probably has the best location for any of Vancouver's upper-tier hotels. The proximity to the shopping, restaurant, and cafe areas of Robson St and Davie Street are fantastic, and you're only a short 5 minute walk from the entertainment district on Granville. Other top-tier downtown hotels may have better vistas (Westin Coal Harbour), but are far away from everything.

I would have assigned a \"4\" rating on this category were it not for the cracked glass panel high up on the North Tower and which appeared to be patched, at least temporarily, by applying lots of duct tape along and across the crack. INTERIOR COMMON SPACE: 4.0 - Functional, in good condition, reasonably well designed and well maintained. ROOM, excluding bathroom: 4.0 - Our room was spacious, - the furnishings and finishings were comfortable and in good condition. The bar style fridge was a plus. BATHROOM: 2.0 - Functional but the cracked wash basin should have been replaced and the toilet required multiple flushes after each use. The single roll toilet tissue dispenser, when coupled with the apparent T.P. rationing policy (see \"HOUSEKEEPING\" below) was particularly irritating. STAFF: 3.5 - As a group they deserve full marks in repect of interpersonal attributes (friendly and pleasant to deal with etc.) The front desk attendants seemed to handle guests that were unhappy with the fact that their rooms weren't ready by check-in time very well and housekeeping staff typically gave a brief but friendly greeting when guests passed them in the halls. I would have rated the staff \"4\" or better, but rightly or wrongly I think they have to accept some, but not all of the blame for the check-in problems and my issues over toilet paper rationing. CHECK-IN EXPERIENCE: 1.5 - We arrived at the hotel at about 1:00 PM Vancouver time, after spending nearly 12 hours enroute. That day (a Saturday) there was a continuous long and slow moving line-up at the check-in counter throughout the entire afternoon and early evening - I went through that line-up four times ie at 1:00 PM (which was before the posted check-in time of 3:00, but I wanted to see if they could accomodate us with an early check-in - they couldn't), at 3:00, at 4:00 and at 4:30. In each instance I was told our room wasn't ready but the last time I more emphatically asked them to find some room for us and the Guest Services person I was dealing with came up with an alternate room and also comped us with vouchers for the breakfast buffet for the following morning. About 15 minutes after we arrived in our room and just after my wife got out of the bathtub, the door was opened by a porter and another couple to whom the room had also been assigned. The other couple had to go back through the line-up at the check-in counter again in order to get another room - similarly the mix-up created the need for me to proceed thru the lin-up (for the fifth time) in order to get our door key-cards recoded. If it were not for the complimentary breakfast vouchers, I would have rated our check-in experience as a 1.0. HOUSEKEEPING: 1.5 - Housekeeping staff did a very good job vis a vis daily cleaning and tidying etc. in our room, but the toilet tissue rationing was a real issue with me. i.e when we checked in there was a bit of tissue on the single roll dispenser in our bathroom PLUS a spare roll in the closet, but once we started to use the spare roll, it was never replaced and the single-roll dispenser would never be refilled till it was completey empty. Also we phoned the housekeeoing department that the toilet was flushing poorly. - after that it only took 2 or 3 flushes - instead of 3 or 4 - to clear the bowl after each use. Note: In order to avoid misinterpretation of the above comments I want to point out to any readers of this review that the flushing problem was not caused by excess use of toilet tissue. My 1.5 rating for \"housekeeping\" also gives consideration to the fact that rooms were not ready by check-in time, notwithstanding this could be due to a staffing deficiency, as opposed to the competence of the statt that were on duty that day. OTHER: This hotel does not provide free in-room internet access, although it can be obtained for $11. or $12. per day plus tax. With respect to in-house food offerings, we used the complimentary coupons for a breakfast and found the food and service to be satisfactory but we also noticed the prices for selections on the menus for on-site restaurants and room service were excessive. Accordingly we ate well at various good restaurants located within reasonable walking distances of the hotel and at appreciably better prices. GENERAL: Our recent trip to British Columbia spanned 9 nights and included stays at three hotels. I experienced much smoother check-ins at the other two hotels each of which offered free in-room internet access and had bathrooms equipped with two roll toilet tissue dispensers. I would give the other two hotels, OVERALL ratings of 3 and 4 respectively, as opposed to the 2 that I believe is appropriate for our experience at the Sheraton Wall Centre in Vancouver", "Date": "September 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Lincs UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in excellent location\u201d", "Author": "Haz45", "ReviewID": "UR19702288", "Content": "Stayed for 12 nights at this hotel and was very happy with the location and the service received.

The rooms have odd angles so furniture is hard to arrange, especially if you've asked for two beds: our first room had a bed in each room, but the desk was in one and the cord for the internet service was at the farthest point away in the other room; our second room, with the desk useful for our necessary computer, had an 18\" closet in which the clothes had to share space with the ironing board; and the little bar area was 6\" away from the edge of one bed. The AC system was horrible -- full-blast on or off, noisy on and switching on and off; because one wall of our room was all glass, facing west, we needed that AC. (The all-glass wall also leads to acres of curtains to pull when you want darkness.) The bath was small. The place is showing its age, and maintenance is sloppy: amateurishly applied caulk around the bathtub, a cracked basin in the bathroom, and a smoke detector dangling from the ceiling! Housekeeping was pretty bad -- one bed not correctly made (one whole corner of sheets and blankets not tucked in), cleanliness not very thorough, and through the course of our week's stay we got fewer and fewer towels and fresh glasses. (At these prices, can't they afford to give more than one drinking glass per person?)

I requested a high floor in the north tower with an early check-in and late check-out and the hotel accommodated.

However, the business center is located in the south tower so that may be a consideration for some. The north tower, by contrast, is very light, airy and the rooms have wonderful floor to ceiling windows that actually open a little to allow for fresh air. The health club is also in the north tower and is free of chrage for hotel guests. The indoor pool and jacuzzi tubs were loved by my kids. Starbucks is also in the north tower. Each tower had an airline check-in kiosk in their respective lobbies, something I have come to love with Sheratons and other hotels. However, the kiosks were only good for some carriers and while my carrier (Alaska/Horizon) was one of the options, I couldn't get the system to accept my information. I ended up in the business center which didn't cost me anything to log on to the internet and print my boarding passes.

I stayed at the Sheraton for four nights recently prior to an Alaskan Cruise. I booked the hotel directly and requested a room in the North Tower, high floor which is exactly what I got (26th) floor. I got the airporter bus from the airport which drops you off at the Sheraton. This is really easy, you come out of the doors of the arrival hall and it is literally to your left just outside the main doors. It is 13 CAD for one way. Anyway, when the bus dropped me off I walked into the South Tower and they checked me in and pointed me in the right direction to the North tower, which is literally just across a patio area. I was really pleased I had requested the North Tower as it is much newer, obviously I didnt see the rooms in the South Tower, but the reception area was much older than the North Tower. I thought the room was lovely, huge bed, when I drew back the curtains and saw the view wow! felt dizzy, I think due to the jet lag. My room was facing the main street, so I suppose first thing in the morning for some people they would find it a little noisy. Traffic noise doesnt bother me and after all you are booking a hotel right in the downtown centre. Hotel was in an excellent position, plenty of restaurants all around. There is a handy deli shop literally across the road, this shop is on three floors and sells a wide range of good food. There is a tiny coffee shop in there too. One downside, if you want wine for your room, this shop does not sell alcohol. There are two specialist wine shops, one belonging to the Sheraton on the corner of the hotel, and one belonging to the Sutton place almost next to the Market Place shop. I think these are predominently wine shops - didnt notice any other type of liquor, bu maybe there is some. I found the staff friendly, in fact I couldnt get over how friendly all the Canadians were. I used the pool in the hotel for an early morning swim and it is a decent size. I didnt eat in the hotel restaurants, so can't comment but did use the Starbucks for a quick breakfast and coffee.

King bed was HUGE (California king) and the sheets were a bejillion count (almost satin) with 8 pillows. Furnishings were all new and the layout of the room was good with bed separated from the office area (although the TV was a little far away to see easily from the bed). I assume room layout varies as the tower is oval shaped, so the rooms along the east/west sides are longer and a little larger while the rooms on the north/south sides of the tower are smaller. Bathroom was adequate and tub had one of those curved shower rails that gives you more room in the shower. Conference provided breakfast and lunch so can't comment on the restaurant (Starbucks on the lower level). But you're right in the heart of downtown.

After staying at the Sheraton and Westin Hotels (both members of the Starwood Group) in Seattle and being very impressed we really thought the same high standard would await us as we moved up to Vancouver. In general terms of room and cleanliness etc it did. However, this large hotel although close to shopping/eating districts only has one small restaurant, and in our opinion it provides a poor selection of food for those travel weary customers who don't want to have to go out to find somewhere for a simple snack before bed. Granted you could just order from room service but the cost is about double what you'd usually pay. They do have a cafe for breakfast which is offered at a reasonable price (for a hotel) but beware of the orange juice they offer to pour as it's a stonking $5 per glass!. The other disappointment was that although internet access is available, it's at an additional cost of $10 per day even in the lobby area. Even the Westin in Seattle provide free WiFi access in their lounge area. The other main issue we have found here is simply the fact that the hotel is situated across the road from a hospital so every night around 2/3 or 4am we would be awaken by very loud sirens. We expect this is only made worse due to each room having a window which can be opened, so sound proofing is probably reduced even in winter. The bathroom is nice and clean but not as well arranged as the other hotels - not so much room around the sink and no where to hang the hand towel or even your swim suits to dry without having them drip all over the floor. That said the hotel is very comfortable, it has a great pool if you like a good swim, and the trolley tour has a stop right outside, making it easy to access various areas of the city over a 2 day period.

The bed was very comfortable but the room seemed poorly arranged, with the TV table blocking the wardrobe and so far away from the bed that I was worried about my neighbours being disturbed by it at night. The loo in the en-suite was right next to the bathroom door and the bath was very small, with a low overflow - more like a large showertray than a bath. You certainly couldn't lie down in it. The complementary toiletries were low quality. There was a large double door which, I think, led directly into next door's room (to turn them into a suite???) but we were able to see the light underneath it and, again, I wondered whether the person next door could hear us. I was surprised to have to pay $10 a day for internet access. I was also concerned about privacy - we had a city view and kept the net curtains open in order to enjoy it but there was an office block and I had a weird phone call on our last morning.

I would expect that a hotel that charges such inflated rates would at least offer standard sized in room safes.

I complained to the concierge and was told that I could leave the computer with them and it would be safe. When I got my computer back, there was a big dent in one corner of the case. I can't prove that they dropped it, because I did not see them do it, but I have never dropped my computer and the dent is new. When I complained to the concierge he was dismissive. I then asked to speak to the manager. He stated that there was little that he could do since it could not be proven that the computer had been damaged in their care. They also make you sign a liability waiver when you drop off your computer. He offered to cut $20 per night from my bill as well as the cost of internet. I insisted that I needed a proper safe for my computer as well and I got moved to a dingy room on a lower floor. There was a problem with ++ heat in the new room and maintenance has just come by and fixed it. I am glad that the manager tried to do something to make up for the damage to my computer (and I accept that I did sign a liability waiver), but I am not really happy with the resolution and I would not stay here in future.

Our window also overlooked the ER of the hospital and the thought of hearing ambulance sirens at all hours didnt go down too well. We had also looked at this hotel on the internet before coming and were looking forward to the view from the floor to ceiling window in the tallest building in downtown vancouver...

So we check in to the new room and now we're talking... The room was large, clean, smelt a heck of a lot better and the view was a lot better. We didnt eat or drink in the hotel as we only had 2 days and wanted to see as much of Vancouver as possible. We also checked out expressly so didnt really have any dealings with front desk / concierge at all. Overall the hotel was very good for what we wanted and provided a good base for to days, but if Id spent any more money I probably would have expected more. Our only other gripe was with the lifts. The north tower was 40 odd stories high, god knows how many rooms were in there, yet they only had 3 lifts available. One of which was out of action for both days we were there.

I just returned from my stay at the Sheraton Wall Centre. I travel for a living and my company aranges the accomendations. Therefore while on vacation I do my best to choose wonderful hotels for my travels. Vancouver is a very expensive place but it is soo worth it and hotels are very expensive also so when I looked at the hotels and the cost I felt really lost to say the least. I usually like to stay under 200 a night but in vancouver this is a problem if you want a quality hotel in a good location. We booked through expedia for $208.00. I read the reviews and felt confident in my choice. The hotel was in a wonderful location. If you want shopping, entertainment, museums, starbucks coffee, restaurants this is your place. The hotel is about three blocks from Robson street which is the main shopping/restaurant drag in Vancouver. Really everything is at your finger tips even a 7-eleven across the street for midnight snacking. The room was a standard sheraton room with a wet bar, fridge, safe. Im ok with the four stars for this hotel . The bed was very comfortable with white linen, the room had alot of space. We had a city view on the 11th floor we could have waited for a higher floor but with this room we were able to check in early around noon. The room was clean and modern, and believe me I checked. I even wipe down the entire room with sanitizing wipes. So a clean room is very important to me. I called down for a couple of things and they were there ASAP. Taxis are always there and the three towers of the hotel are beautiful. The conceige was very helpeful and polite. The conceige even gave us VIP passes to get into a blues club. The only thing that was concerning was the plumbing. It's not what you think but every time the hot water in the shower was turned on a loud noise started to sound throughout the entire room. So overall our experience was great. Also please give yourself at least four to five days to explore Vancouver. This was a weekend getaway and we really needed four days. The tours can take up an entire day and your so tired you really need a rest day or a bad weather day in there somewhere. We usually hate to waste a day staying in the hotel but this hotel was so nice we really enjoyed laying in bed for one day. Oh there is one other thing they really should have a jacuzzi in the hotel. They only have a indoor pool. FYI tours to the other islands and the whale watching tours take up an entire day and your very tired after your exploring. So dress very warm (layer) and stay a day or two at a different island a day tour is too much drama and time. We went from a bus at 7am to a boat to the island to a 2nd bus to a ferrie and then a #rd bus ride all in one day only to get back at 9pm. This was our travel plans for a whale watching tour to Victoria. Stay in Vancouver it will take you a week just to cover it. Travel to the other islands only if you have alot of time, because it takes so much time to get back and forth.

Because I wanted to explore outside Vancouver a bit, I rented a car at the airport and drove to the hotel. The valet guys can park your car or you can park it in the self-park parking deck below the towers (either way, your car ends up in the same place... the only difference is the price, $30 CAD for valet versus $26 CAD for self-park). The self-park entrance is on Hornby street. At check-in time, there was no extra recognition or any extra amenities involved for being a SPG Gold Member. The one SPG Gold perk I did receive was that they did extend my checkout time to 3 p.m. on my last day. I landed in a regular room in the North tower, 15th floor. The floor to ceiling windows gave a spectacular view of the cityscape (I wasn't aimed towards any water at all). Outside the building, it looks to me like some of the windows in the building are openable so you can get some fresh air, but this wasn't the case in my room. There were basic soap bars, shampoo (Pantene) and conditioner bottles in the bathroom. I was annoyed when looking at the half height shower head (i.e. the highest it would adjust was up to my chest), but when I noticed the 2nd peephole at half height in the door, I realized I was in a handicapped accessible room. Indeed, the grips in the bathroom (around the bathtub, around the toilet) were very sturdy and I'd say this room is great for differently abled folks. By the way, this handicapped room had a bathtub and not an accessible shower (with a sit down seat, which I've seen in other handicapped rooms at other hotels), so a differently abled person may require assistance in order to get maneuvered into the tub. The room had a cabinet that hides a room safe (wide enough to put my laptop into) and an empty fridge. The door on this cabinet was broken, the shower curtain bar was barely hanging on, and one of the \"down\" arrow lights on the elevators in the hallway was burned out; I'd say ongoing maintenance is an issue at this hotel. The closet has a motion sensor so stepping into it turns on a light, which turns off after 5 seconds (too short!) Local & toll-free calls are $1.60 to start with, plus 10 cents per minute after an hour. Room service is $2.75 + 15% service charge PLUS gratuities are expected. Internet is $12.37 for 24 hours access. Breakfast buffet ($22 CAD) didn't taste very fresh when I ate it at 10 a.m. my first morning there. Sundays the Sheraton offers \"brunch\", which is a later-running ('til 2 p.m.), slightly more elaborate, more expensive ($30 CAD) version of the buffet (Cesar salads, carved roasts, etc.). I picked off the menu for another breakfast and had the Orange Ricotta Pancakes, which was so rich my wife accused me of indulging in \"breakfast cake\". The portion size of the breakfast items off the menu were huge (i.e. to encourage sharing?) Did you notice I listed the prices for everything in my review? That seemed to be the overwhelming theme of my hotel stay. Every little hotel-related goods & services that a price tag could be slapped on, it sure felt like there was one there.

The hotel itself was very quiet. The shower had nice water pressure and the beds and pillows were the best! The hotel had a couple of restuarants but the line to the Cafe was way too long for us to go in.

We also drove to Metropolis mall which was on the Eastside of Vancouver - about a 30 minute drive. The pool/workout facilities were nice although the pool is not very deep.

A bit farther on Davie St. we found a shoe repair store (curtesy of the staff at Joe's who looked it up in the phone book when we asked about a repair store. They really went above and beyond!) It felt like a real neighborhood up there. (There were a few people down on their luck in a doorway or two, but they were just sitting and not begging) We found the least expensive postcards for our entire trip at a novelty store we passed. Our best experience at this hotel was dining at one of the restaurants in the South Tower, \"Indigo\". We had gotten in late from the ferry from Victoria and arrived at about 9:40 pm, and they close at 10 pm. We were worried the staff would be grumpy at such late arrivals but the waitress could not have been more gracious. Out food was delicious, a surprise at a hotel restaurant, and we did not feel rushed by the staff at all.

Check in was fast, but no crib was put in the room as I had requested. I had first put the request in writing on the booking page, and then when I called the hotel to add an extra night to our booking I told the reservations clerk that we need a crib and she curtly responded to me that \" yes, I know as you already stated it in your on line reservation\". I told her that I was just making sure as we needed it for the extra night too. We had to call the front desk 3 times to get the crib to our room and it was very late already when we arrived and my baby needed to sleep. Our room layout was nice as we had a bedroom for our baby to sleep in and we could watch TV or talk without disturbing him. The furnishings were a little worn, but the bed was comfortable. The walls were very thin, and we could hear the people above us cough, and could hear their TV. The room key needed to be used for the elevator and maybe worked half the time. We were not the only guests that were frustrated by this, and had to wait many times for someone else to use their key so we could get to our room, and had to use our key to help others get to their room. The key then would not work in the room either and we would need to get it activated again. We went down twice to use the hot tub ( they actually have two) but never got to use it as one was empty for our whole stay, and the other was having water added to it one night meaning that the temperature was only warm, and then the next night it was closed for chemical reasons. They should wait until the health club is closed to do this maintenance or make sure that at least one of the tubs is working. I found that most of the staff were only lukewarm, and not too friendly. We travel to Vancouver often for my husband's work and have stayed in some of the nicer hotels. We will not be returning to the Sheraton as we found the service and rooms to be much better at other hotels in Vancouver, especially since it is comparable in price to many of the nicer hotels. It was nice to have a one bedroom suite, but many other hotels can provide that too for the same price, and with better service.

The furnishings were all in a sleek modern style, but a bit scuffed in places. The bed linens were luxurious and the mattress was the most comfortable I have ever slept on. The room had an iron and ironing board, plus extra blankets (but not pillows) in the closet. One annoyance was that all the lights are on a \"master switch\" located unobtrusively near the door, so I spent the first five minutes flicking the light switches on and off to no avail until I discovered that the master switch had to be turned on before anything else would work. The maid service was almost too attentive, as on the first afternoon we were there a maid opened our door without knocking. She was profusely apologetic and extremely polite, and I am sure it was an honest mistake, but it reminded me to close the deadbolt. The hotel's location is fairly convenient to the major sights in downtown Vancouver, but there are plenty of unsavory characters wandering around the neighborhood at night, as the area is not completely gentrified yet. Unless you are about 14 years old and heavily into body piercing, forget about Robson Street, whose reputation as a shopping and see-and-be-seen destination became undeserved about five years ago. The good clubs, shops and restaurants are in Yaletown a few blocks east of the Sheraton. The front desk staff were friendly and polite. We arrived very early in the day before the room was ready, and needed to change clothes to go to a formal luncheon. They kept our bags for us and let us change in the locker room of the health club. The parking garage is too small and infernally difficult to navigate. We actually \"lost\" our car at one point, because the markings on the garage wall didn't seem to correspond to those on the elevator buttons. Fortunately the front desk set us straight (it turns out that there are two level \"P2s,\" and to get to one of them you press elevator button \"B\" instead of \"P2,\") but I think they could make that a little clearer.

If you're looking for good quality at reasonable prices I'd try out the White Spot, The Red Robin or Milestones, all within a 10 minute walk.

There were none available, so I unplugged one of the plugged in plugs (specifically, the one that powers the \"mock\" refrigerator) and plugged the computer cable in. I saw a spark. I didn't think much of it, unplugged the cord and started working on battery. A couple of hours later, my battery ran out, so I proceded to recharge it using a different outlet, to avoid a second spark. I discovered at that point that the computer charger had become unusable. I ran downstairs to the front desk and explained the situation to the Guest Service Supervisor. He contacted tech support and they advised me to go to the Business Center, e-mail the document to myself, retrieve it on one of the computers there and continue to work.

I was greatly distressed, because I was risking being unable to work on a presentation that was the entire reason why I had travelled to Vancouver.

We'd requested the highest room available, but were given one on the 7th floor. Each side of our corner view room looked straight out onto a massive building. This is not what I would call a great view worthy of the premium we paid. The furnishings were modern and comfortable, and the bed was quite nice. The bathroom was also modern and nice, although a tad small and cramped. The only thing that was bothersome about the room itself was a damp mildew, wet rag odor that never went away, even with the windows opened. That was unfortunate, but we thought that perhaps it was a function of being in a wet and humid city. It wasn't a big deal, but it served as a reminder that we were not in a first tier hotel. If you are interested in a fitness center, do not look forward to the one at the hotel. It is old, cramped, ill-maintained, ill-equipped, and smells of chlorine from the pool. It's functional, but far from state of the art or pleasant. Service at the North Tower lobby bar was very good at times, and not so good at others, depending on who was tending. One evening we stopped at the bar for martinis, and I also requested a decaf coffee. The waitress responded \"We don't serve any coffee here. This is a BAR.\" Wow. Not only was that condescension uncalled for, but the next night we saw coffee being served to a couple at the same bar. But that was the only instance of rudeness we encoutered anywhere in Vancouver, which has well earned its reputation as a genuinely friendly and hospitable city. Vancouver is beautiful beyond words, and the Sheraton is centrally located, within walking distance of many sites and neighborhoods. We never took a cab anywhere (other than the ferry cabs).

I fell into the second category. No worries though because there's a gym called \"World Fitness\" that's only a few blocks away. They charged me $10 for a day visit. A MUCH BETTER option if you want a full gym -- although WF didn't have a steam room or sauna or pool. Parking at the Sheraton is VERY expensive -- $22 self parking. You are able to park at the meters on the street for free after 8PM and until 9AM. The phone calls are also expensive - $1.60 for a line. A lot of Westins now have a flat rate Communications Package -- not the Sheraton. Internet was $11. Location wise this is not a bad location. Although, I had the option to stay at the Westin Bay Shore and I regretted not staying there because it is right on the water and next to Stanley Park. I had to drive down there to go blading but if I'd stayed at the Westin I would have been able to lace up and go. Any way you slice it, the Sheraton Vancouver is a top notch property that is worth staying at. You won't regret it. Service is great and this is definitely a 4 or 5 star hotel. I would give it a 5 star b/c there's a Starbucks right in the hotel !!", "Date": "July 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3599257", "Content": "Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights.

In addition, I could not get a refund of the GST taxes I had paid for all of my souvenirs because I did not meet the minimum dollar amount required without my hotel taxes.

Shawn told me there were no upgrades available because the hotel is booked solid. The Sheraton wall center is over 35 floors, he put me on the 10th floor. He said there were also no rooms avaible above 10th floor. I had a special request for high floors. After I checked in, I called SPG Plat services and they said there were lots of suites and 1 bedrooms available and Shawn should have upgraded me. So they called sheraton wall front desk and had me \"taken care off\". Needless to say, the problem was resolved and a 1 bedroom suite magically did appear and I was moved to the 27th floor. Beside all this hoopla, the exclusive club level is small. the food was good and service at the exclusive lounge was good.

Room rate converted to about $140 USD/night at the time. Check-in was a breeze. We were able to choose from a lower or higher floor and stayed on the 27th floor of the north tower. The views were tremendous with the floor to ceiling windows. The Sleeper beds were awesome (my wife wants to return just for that). The room felt spacious with a small sitting area. Probably felt bigger because of that incredible view. The bellman was terrific quickly bringing up our luggage that was lost the day before by the airline (never have had my luggage show up on the same day when flying Delta) and helped us find our first watering hole and micro brews around town. Concierge was outgoing and went out of his way to take care of our requests. The indoor pool located in the north tower was average, but it was nice to be able to open the windows in there to catch a cool breeze and watch cars pass by on the downtown streets below. We took a shuttle from the airport, so we didn't have to worry about parking which I understand is costly. Certainly don't need a car to get around. Almost everything is within walking distance. Easy walk to False Creek, a short water taxi from there to the market, etc. Tons of shopping, bars, restaurants, hash cafe, etc. within walking distance. If you want to go to Grouse Mountain or the suspension bridge, just take a taxi. Cost was about $25 CAD or so each way if I remember correctly from last year. Share the cab with another couple and it's that much easier. Never bothered dining at the hotel.

Initially, my request for a \"corner room\" on an \"upper floor\" of the \"north tower\" was met.

The view, even from an 18th floor room, was inspiring! (It's a pity we can't post our photos on this website.) I could only imagine, though, that floors above 27 could see beyond the surrounding buildings and into the horizonal sunset. The room was modern, comfortable, and tastefully appointed. Most impressive was the decorative artwork that appeared to depict the surrounding neighborhood during autumn (I'm curious now, whether the artwork is rotated seasonally). The sleek sitting area and the dry bar with wine glasses and complimentary cork screw added a touch of elegance. The bed was like a cloud, on which I enjoyed some of the best slumber I'd had in a long time. On the downside (yes, this hotel does have a couble drawbacks), the cost to park under the hotel complex was more than the cost of my rental car ($23/day to park vs $17/day to rent a car). Even the seasoned directionalist would get lost in the maze of illmarked parking ramps, elevators, and staircases that seem to lead you through a hodgepodge of parking mayhem (not to mention the incautious vallet drivers barrelling around every corner). MOST FRUSTRATING, though, was the fact that the onsite swimming pool and fitness center closed at 8:30PM during the weekends. I'm not sure if this is a Canadian phenomenon or a Sheraton hotel policy, but it was very disappointing to not be able to take advantage of the relaxation and fitness facilities after enjoying the city during the day.
