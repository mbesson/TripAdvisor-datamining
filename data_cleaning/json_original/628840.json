It is not a pension it is a tenament block and the spare units are let out at a very cheap rate. I arrived at night and walked past it first time thinking it was as it has no real sign so to speak. What do you get a bed and clean sheets, there is a small kitchen area but not a thing in it no glass, knife or fork nothing. The decor is basic and bland and there was a small basic table and 2 chairs. I was in room 302 and had a wonderful view across to Potsdamer platz towards the Sony center, i would imagine it to be quite depressing if you did not have a view. The location is about perfect close to all travel amenities which is why I chose to stay here in the first place. I enjoyed my stay in Berlin the sights and feel of the city is fantastic I will returning soon. To sum up it is hard to put this place down I paid 86 euro for 3 nights so for that price you can't expect too much. I slept soundly every night but in fairness I walked the city end to end each day so I was dead on my feet by the end of each day. If you do stay here you get what you pay for a cheap bed centrally located there may be better ones for the price I don't know. What I do know is there is no atmosphere here so dont go there expecting to meet other travellers.", "Date": "November 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilmington, Delaware", "Title": "\u201cIt's one of the cheapest in Berlin...\u201d", "Author": "Mohikaner", "ReviewID": "UR14548811", "Content": "but even cheap has it's limits. We stayed 2 nights and paid \u20ac53 per night, so for Berlin, that's bottom of the ladder. We weren't expecting much, possibly hostel level or b&b standards, after all we were in Berlin to see the city and have a place to sleep after a lot of walking around. Now we are far from being demanding, sheltered and spoiled but it was hard to find the room welcoming in any way. The place is in need of renovation; the carpets are very soiled - there is a vacuum cleaner in the hallway for guests to use but the look of the carpet itself is simply from many years of use with a history of dubious stains. We wore shoes all the time. There was a kitchenette in the room but again it's difficult to determine whether it was dirty from lack of cleaning or dirt accumulation from years of use . Either way, it was un-appetizing to even look at. The enclosed pic was the corner join of the counter in the kitchenette. Above your head dangling from the flourescent striplight you'll see dusted cobwebs from an age around the time the Berlin wall was still standing. The toilet is a mantrap. In the north of Germany you get the 'inspection shelf' type of toilets, but the seat is flimsy and has a lot of give. Perch carefully or it may get messy... It's not the service, they lady at reception was nice and pleasant, but the fact that the place needs major renovation. The doors in the room have holes in them from careless users who opened two doors too quickly at the same time. We also had stickers, but in our case, they probably really did improve the room somewhat. Like I said, we're not airy fairy and dreaming of luxury, but basic standards have to be met. On reflection there are alternatives for the price range - plenty of them. I wonder if the standards in them are higher than what we experienced? We did enjoy the city very much. This pension was a bit of a let-down. Our room was 502.", "Date": "March 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm", "Title": "\u201cDon't expect too much and you will be pleased\u201d", "Author": "MrJan", "ReviewID": "UR14036922", "Content": "This is a very difficult place to either recommend or tell people to stay away from. But basically it is a place to sleep that is reasonably clean and quite cheap, but also a little depressing. It feels like living in some old and abandoned east-Berlin interrogation quarter. Don't expect the reception to be open regulary, we never understood when someone was there. You can cook in your room and they provide you with cutlery and such stuff, but since we only saw the reception open when we arrived it was quite difficult to get hold on. But if you get a room on the upper floors the view is beautiful, the location of the place is excellent and the surrounding area is quiet enough. Granted, it is a very different place to other pensions or hotels, but for the price I guess it's okay.", "Date": "March 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex, England", "Title": "\u201cPrison Chic!\u201d", "Author": "HJEP", "ReviewID": "UR6699967", "Content": "\"Converted\" eastern bloc apartments with as much atmosphere as a funeral. When we arrived they expected full payment, which we did not have. We asked if we could go and find a cashpoint and draw out the money to pay later which was agreed. There was no-one attending reception for the next day and a half. Consequently we could not give them the cash to clear the bill. In our room one morning we heard some noises at the door and were shocked to be confronted with 2 burly men who had been \"sent to change the locks\". Luckily I could speak German and explained how we had been trying to pay the bill but due to the lack of staff on reception this proved impossible. I was spoken to very rudely and wondered what would have happened had we not been in the room at the time i.e to our personal possessions....... The room itself was at the end of an uninhabited and very long corridor which felt like something out of the film \"The Shining\". Beds were on opposite sides of the room and solid iron (prison grade) - no opportunity to push together. The \"apartment\" had no cutlery/crockery as stated on the website, (this had to be requested from reception but seeing as no-one was there we couldn't). Bathroom had no windows and was grubby. Fridge was covered with children's stickers (see attached picture). Room was freezing cold and no spare covers/duvet. Room also overlooked a noisy youth hostel and we had to take out our rubbish to the bins down the road every morning. Overall a disappointing experience especially when considering the cost \u00a350 (80 Euros) a night could buy an excellent room at the Express Holiday Inn (Anhalter Bahnhof), which we have since stayed at and highly recommend.
