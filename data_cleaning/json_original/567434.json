The hotel is dreadful, rooms are dirty, service non-existent and they refuse cancellations.

This place should be reported to the authorities as I cannot believe their behaviour is in accordance with the rules laid down for hotel operators. We were a large group in Berlin and when I saw what fellow travellers' had for the same money I paid for a small, filthy room I was very disappointed.

Found the place to be much better than I thought it might be. The hotel occupies the second, third, and fourth floors of a 5 storey building which is part of a wider block and fronted by a busy road with 3 lanes of traffic in each direction but not too noisy, especially at night ( though I did wear earplugs ). Just behind the hotel is a nice medium sized park with a lake at its centre and sunbathers, dog walkers, and joggers. The transfer to the hotel is fairly easy from Tegel airport- just catch Bus 109 for 2 Euros and ten cents which runs every 10 minutes each way until the early hours and takes about 15 minutes and get off at Kanstrasse and walk along Kanstrasse for 5 minutes until you come to Neuekanstrasse and the hotel is at No. 5. Arrival at Tegel airport to the hotel door took only 70 minutes, with baggage being exceptionally quick and the plane parking up before that in about only 2 minutes. The single room I occupied was very small but quite comfortable with a single bed, tv with 14 channels ( all in German ), bedside cabinet, wardrobe with plenty of hangers, chair, small table, large modern sink in the corner with instant hot water from the tap ; there was also a large central heating radiator on the wall. The room had a large, tall window which opened fully inwards which made up for the fact there is no air conditioning- this was not needed in the room, despite the hot weather. There was no tea or coffee making facilities in the room and no phone. Sheets and used towels were changed every day and the room cleaned at about 1pm- a bit of a nuisance as about that time I would be arriving back from the Olympic Stadium after the morning session of the athletics. The room came with a private bathroom in the corridor- this was large and cool with a good shower but I was not convinced it was private as there was no lock on the door and on at leat one occasion another person used it. I raised this with the manager ( a Russian bloke ) but I did not get anywhere. I did not mind sharing the bathroom if that was what was going on- but a shared bathroom meant I was paying about 90 Euros too much for the room over the 12 days which I was not happy about. The included breakfast in the fairly small but never overcrowded breakfast room was good : choice of 4 cereals, pots of yoghurts, fruit cocktail from a bowl ( the sort you get in tins ), 2 fruit juices, sliced meats and sliced cheeses, warm boiled eggs, 3 types of bread, no toast, a sweet bread , tea and coffee, and served between 8 and 10am. No air conditioning in this room ( or anywhere in the hotel ) but it was not needed despite the hot weather. There are windows in the braekfast room which were usually open and it was quite pleasant. The staff at the hotel were all older and mature and you did not see much of them after breakfast- save for the cleaners. Most of the time there is no one at the small reception counter in the corridor outside the breakfast room but if you ring a bell someone will appear. The reception closes at 11pm so If you are going to arrive after that time let them know as they have a procedure for dealing with this. I liked the fact that the staff were largely not to be seen- this felt more relaxing and free and there were no shenanigans going on in their absence ( I think some of them may live in the hotel on the first floor, though I am not sure ). You have to pay in advance on arrival at the hotel and they do ask for payment in cash though they said they would accept a accept a credit card if you did not have the cash . You receive one key which both enables you to access the building and your room. I was not required to pay a key deposit. I did not see any internet facilities at the hotel. Opposite the hotel there is a supermarket with a good choice of foods to buy and useful for getting water and the like ( they charge 25cents extra for each bottle of water and you get that bank when you return the bottle )- I wouldn't recommend the tap water at the hotel for drinking- it certainly did not agree with me... Near the hotel there are plenty of small restaurants and other places to eat. The nearest tube station ( U Bahn ) is Sophie Charlotte Place -a leisurely 5 minutes walk, turn left out of the hotel and ten yards away take the first left again and just walk to the top of this road - where the U2 line runs ( it is only 4 stops to the Olympic Stadium, hotel to stadium just 18 minutes ). Opposite this tube station there is a useful internet cafe which charges 50cents for 30 minutes, one Euro for an hour. If you stay at the hotel, I would suggest avoiding the first floor of the hotel ( 2nd floor of building itself ) as this is where the reception and breakfast room is and you would have a lot more noise to put up with and possibly less privacy, especially in the morning ( I stayed in the floor above so did not experience this ). People from many different countries were staying at the hotel ( possibly partly explained by people staying to attend the athletics ) - I am not sure there were any any other Brits, though. The people ranged from younger couples to families with young children and they all behaved impeccably. All in all, this is advertised as a one star hotel but it is really much better than that. That said, I paid about \u00a333 for each night and I still think that was overpriced. I would recommend this hotel if you need to saty in this are of Berlin. I chose it to make it easier to attend the athletics and, in that regard, it was a very good choice.

The location was okay, nice and close the Schloss Charlottenburg, but doesn't overlook a lake, it is on a busy road. Really, the photos don't show how grimey it is, and it looks like it could do with a big spring clean.
