I stayed at this hotel with my mom from February 29 until March 5 and we were both pleasantly surprised. The staff member at the desk was very friendly and helpful and had us up in our room within minutes. While it was small, there was more than enough space to accommodate two single beds, a table between the beds and both of our suitcases with no difficulty. We never had to squeeze past one another or tripped over anything. The beds were somewhat hard, which is more to my mom's taste. I simply put the spare blanket under the bottom sheet of my bed for cushioning and it was perfect. The linens were changed daily and the room was kept very clean. The bathroom was very small, and the shower head was a bit awkward, but everything was functional. We had an excellent view of Big Ben and the London Eye from our window (we were on the fifth floor), Other guests in the building were courteous and quiet after hours, so we both slept soundly. I'm not sure why so many people have complained about the breakfast on this site. Of course, neither me nor my mom are accustomed to eating massive greasy meals early in the morning. A couple of slices of toast with jam and coffee were just what we needed and we were thrilled that they were free. There are a variety of cooked breakfasts available for a reasonable charge for the gluttonous travelers. The best thing about this hotel by far was the location. We walked to every restaurant (I recommend Chimes for their roast lamb) and most of the attractions including Parliament, Westminster, Buckingham Palace, Harrods, and the Apollo Victoria theatre (we saw Wicked, which was absolutely fabulous) and all of the beautiful gardens. For places that were a bit further away, Victoria Station was a short walk from the hotel steps. If you expect five-star accommodations, you should expect to pay for a five-star hotel. Besides, if you're spending a lot of time in your hotel room while surrounded by everything that London has to offer, you're wasting a trip. Huttons Hotel offers a comfortable, affordable and convenient place to keep your luggage and rest after long, exciting days in an incredible city.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bournemouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cthink again\u201d", "Author": "susie m", "ReviewID": "UR126189742", "Content": "terrible room small with a smelly blanket very small bathroom i was under the impression all rooms had telephones which they do not for breakfast you have to go to the basement which wasnt to bad but this place is not 3 star they dont deserve 1star it really is terrible", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lima, Peru", "Title": "\u201cNot a 3 star Hotel.

They offered many options and I chose this hotel because its proximity to Victoria Station and because it was rated a 3 star hotel. I reserved for two nights, but I was with my family and stayed only one night. My wife was getting cold and there was no way to increase the temperature, because heating was off. When I demanded the reception about the heating system they said, that if was going to be on in 10 minutes because it was centrlly controlled. There were 2 degrees in London and there was no way to raise the temperature in our rooms. The room that was given to my daughter had a 14 inches CRT television, a little bit smaller than my laptop screen. In summary, the rooms are so small, they have been added a portable bathroom (the ones you can see in building constructions) in all rooms in order to have the rooms private baths. There is no space for anything, Breakfast is served in the basement, and there are no enough tables for all visitors. The day I stayed I had to form a queue in order to get a table and then another to get some food. I have reviewed star rating in UK and a required condition for a hotel to be a 3 star hotel is to have telephones in all rooms. Huttons does not have telephones in their rooms . Thus there is no wake up service. This hotel honestly deserves ONE STAR. I can understand the owner\u2019s all measures they have taken to increase the star rating to this hotel cheating UK authorities.

We got there at 6.00pm Receptionist was very helpful told us what ever we needed to know even gave us a map ,gave us our key card and went up to our room the room number was 405. We went in the room and we looked to see what we have and what we don't we are a family of 4 . we had a double bed and 2 singles 2 side tables a clothes hanging space and an ensuite ,a small shelve for tea and coffee.apart from a window that at night we could see the London eye.Now some important notes Was the room small ? YES but good enough Was the ensuite Small?? Yes but again good enough Was the room a bit noisy ? maybe lift noise or people corridor traffic???Well yes but what do expect from a London 3 star Hotel ?? all that is all normal in a London Hotel .if you dont want that you should book a room in the country side. it was very good for the price paid and it was clean ,cleaned everyday , tea and coffee updated every day,towels changed everyday, beds updated everyday room was updated every day. Breakfast area clean , true we had toast butter cheese jam coffee,tea cereal as much as we wanted but dear lord what do people except a 4 coarse meal??? if you wanted extra's like bacon sausages or what ever there was a small charge no big deal at all.Apart from that they had 3 double toasters everything in order and the staff was excellent very helpful and tables cleaned at once.The Hotel is just a 10minute walk from Victoria station and Victoria station has the lot ,Transit to Gatwick airport ,trains to main cities in Europe, trains to English stations, Underground, and Bus stations, taxis you name it. If you are a true traveler you can walk to marble arch in 50 minutes or to Buckingham Palace in 35 .Also the hotel has another underground nearby only 10 minutes walk again ,its Pimlico station .The hotel has a near bus stop also. Well i think that's enough to guide you,. All i can say is i have stayed in many London hotels and beleive me , i have slept in more expensive rooms than this and was very disappointed, This London hotel was value for money ,I would go again and again as i said before i stayed in 405 i used the breakfast area and the reception and in my opinion it was very very satisfactory Paul T_ _ _ _ _ from Malta", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malta", "Title": "\u201cNice staff, but the room was horrible.\u201d", "Author": "Vulcan131", "ReviewID": "UR123241942", "Content": "I have stayed for 3 nights, the location was perfect for my needs with 10 minutes walk from Victoria Station.

People pass in-front of your room you can even hear their breath. The corridors are just a meter wide.

Seriously, you need to be a contortionist to be able to get out of the shower and back into your room, the shower soaks the bathroom floor so you will skid and bang your shins on the bed. No wardrobe, nowhere to put a suitcase, I began to feel horribly claustrophobic in my room which was taking on the character of a prison cell. The chemical toilet aroma infiltrates the room - it is really unpleasant.

Cheap cardboard croissants, make your own toast, cereal, one type of very cheap tea bags and coffee.

If you're paying full price (which I did - \u00c2\u00a377/night for a single room in October?!), you're getting bilked. My review will be as fair as possible, because there are good points (thus my giving it a 2 rather than a 1), but it will be honest, too. Advertising basics like in-room telephones, and then not even having one in the lobby for guests to use, is but one of the many issues at Huttons. Let us begin the long and detailed upside/downside list, and I hope its length doesn't make it unhelpful to potential guests! The upsides: 1) location! As others have noted, there's a bus stop right in front, and it's also a very easy walk to get to Victoria Station (I'm disabled, needing a cane to walk sometimes, so if I can say it's a decent walk, most people will find it a breeze!). If you're comeone who likes to walk about and see a neighbourhood that way, there's lots to look at in the surrounding blocks & it's not far from some of the biggest tourist attractions in London, not to mention a lot of the best West End theatres. 1b) NEARBY SHOPS, PUBS, CORNER STORES, ETC. An extension of the points for location: the shops and small eateries in the immediate area. Very handy to have convenience stores only a block away (a note to people who like to travel via public transit: most of the nearby mini-marts will top up your Oyster card for \u00c2\u00a35, so you can use the bus and tube system exhaustively that way!). It's only two or three blocks to walk to a full-on market if you're looking for more than just packets of gum or cookies. Less than a block away is a shop that sells an array of wines/beer/spirits and basic foodstuffs. There are some kitschy shops as well, not tourist traps but places with interesting character, that are worth a browse. Several of them are charity stores, which is a bonus. If you need to shop for pretty much anything, necessity-wise - food, drink, snacks, books, umbrellas, postcards/stamps, phone cards, even some clothes - you'll find a shop right within that block that sells it. 2) TOLERABLE NOISE LEVELS FROM OUTSIDE. Even though I was unable to close the window in my room (it was open when I arrived, and my arms weren't long enough to even attempt to reel it in - it stands to note, though, that I didn't ask the staff to help, so it's not on them), I found the noise outside tolerable, especially given that the 24 bus that runs along Belgrave and stops outside is a round-the-clock route. It helps that my room faced the back/\"courtyard\" (though I'll address a negative about *that* later), so if you're sensitive to outside noise, request a room that doesn't front onto the main road. 3) A SINGLE TRAVELLER *CAN* FIT IN A SINGLE ROOM. If you're a solo traveller, like I was, the rooms are still astonishingly small, but they can accommodate one person's luggage and you probably won't bark your shins on everything. (If you happen to have a friend stop in to meet up with you, though, it's true that two people cannot conceivably pass one another inside the room, not without one person having to sit on the bed while the other one squeezes past! And I'll address the bathroom in a moment...under the \"downsides\" heading.) 4) HOUSEKEEPING. The housekeeping staff is lovely. They readily knock on doors at a reasonable hour for jet-lagged folks - usually around 1 p.m. - to offer fresh towels each day, and both young women I spoke to were very pleasant and cheerful. 5) DECENT CURTAINS/DRAPES. In my room, at least, I found that the curtains were heavy enough to keep it from getting unbearably bright when I needed to sleep in and shake off the jet lag. The lace sheers underneath give a bit of privacy when the drapes themselves are open, and they allow fresh air to come in if you leave your window open while you're out for the day. 6) THE CYCLE PARK. Across the road and down maybe half a block you'll find a stable of bicycles that you can pop some coins in and rent for the day, which is a great alternative to walking if you know the best areas for biking. The downsides: 1) IMPOLITE, UNHELPFUL RECEPTION STAFF. The desk staff are the complete opposite of the housekeeping staff. Very unpleasant to deal with, and I'm not someone who has reason to complain about such things very often at all. My check-in took a long time, and when I had finally gotten up to my room one floor up, I'd barely set my bags down when the desk clerk knocked at my door, informing me that he had accidentally authorized my credit card for only the first night, and he needed me to come back dow to reception to pay the full amount for my stay right then and there. The receipts made little sense, so I'll have to check my credit card statement to make sure I didn't get double-billed for a night! 1b) STAFF EVEN RUDE ABOUT THINGS THE HOTEL SAYS IT HAS. Another issue with desk staff: It is advertised on Huttons' website (and right on the envelope in which you're given the room key, in fact) that every room has a telephone, and even modem access. I'd left my itinerary and hotel phone #s for family back in Canada so they could ring me and see that I'd arrived safely at each leg of my journey. Before I had a chance to let them know that there were no phones of any sort, not even a pay phone in the lobby, my mother rang from Canada and asked the front desk if she could be patched through to my room. She was very impolitely told that \"we don't have phones in the rooms here, so I suggest you tell your daughter to buy a prepaid mobile and talk to her that way,\" and then he hung up on her! 2) THE NAUSEATING SMELL OF THE BLANKETS. Contrary to the reviews which stated that the room was \"absolutely fine as long as you were out and about most of the day,\" I have to say that my experience was not as good. After being out with friends for hours and being tired enough to finally return and get some sleep, I laid down on the bed for the first time and was horrified to find that the smell of it made me feel sick! I can't even describe it; it smelled terribly musty, but there was something worse to that scent (urine? mothballs? sweat?? Possibly all of the above). I honestly thought I might be ill if I couldn't escape it, and contemplated sleeping whilst sitting up in the small chair stuffed into the corner of the room. Mercifully the sheets and pillow cases smelled faintly like bleach, which indicated cleanliness, at least. I narrowed down the source of the terrible smell and found it was the top blanket, which I promptly tossed off my bed and left in the corner nearest the window. I was lucky to find another blanket on a rack of clothes hangers that didn't smell as dirty as the first, so if you have the same problem, do look up on the one shelf there is in the room, and you may luck out like I did. I was reluctant to even consider asking the desk staff for new bedclothes after already being treated quite rudely twice on my first day there! 3) THE BATHROOM. You've already read it all by now, I'm sure, but I have to add my voice to the chorus. It is a bizarre contraption, almost certainly a modified port-a-potty normally used in coach buses or caravans/RVs. A person of average size cannot turn around in any direction without hitting the wall, the sink, the toilet, or - god forbid - slipping down the treacherous couple of inches which are all that separate rest of the bathroom's floor from the \"shower.\" I felt like I had to get better at yoga when first attempting to wash my hair (another side note: if you do book here, bring *something* that resembles soap or shampoo, as it's not supplied, not even for purchase. There isn't even a single cheap bar of soap by the sink for hand-washing - a lot of which you will be wanting/needing to do after using these facilities! - and the hand-soap pump affixed to the shower wall may not work or may be empty). Despite ensuring that the shower curtain was pulled properly around before even turning the water on, a good deal of water did flood its way onto the floor in front of the toilet and sink, so I had to use a towel to sop it up as best I could. I regretted not having brought some kind of flip-flops or pool shoes, as setting bare feet onto any part of that floor, let alone the shower, made me worry about catching something. Also worth noting (ESPECIALLY FOR DISABLED/ELDERLY/INJURED/PREGNANT GUESTS) is the fact that the bathroom, quite obviously just built into a corner that may once have been a closet, is RAISED. You'll need to take a step nearly a foot high to climb into the bathroom, and even able-bodied people seem to require hanging onto something to avoid falling straight into the toilet. Because of the proximity to the bed, and the strange wood-and-plastic door being all that's between the sleeping quarters and the \"washing up\" quarters, the smell of the toilet is unavoidable within the room. It's quite an unpleasant scent even before anyone has used the facilities, probably due to mould and whatever is used in the toilet tank. It really is very much like the smell of the chemical toilets you'd use on a plane or a long bus ride...but the bathrooms on those are actually bigger in some cases. (A friend of mine who is a bit on the taller side than I am - she's 5'8\" - had to ask me to leave the hotel room completely in order for her to use the toilet, as she was unable to close the bathroom door due to her knees sticking out too far! THAT is how small these things are.) 3b) GUESTS WITHOUT THE ENSUITE USE A TOILET YOU CAN HEAR FROM YOUR ROOM ALL TOO WELL ON THE GROUND FLOOR. I was one floor up from the lobby, and I believe the shared bathroom for guests who didn't get rooms with ensuites is on the basement floor, which also happens to be on the same level as the \"courtyard\" in the back. If you have a room that faces onto that side, you won't hear as much road noise, but you *will* hear very noisy plumbing out there all night long. For my first night there, I kept thinking it must've just begun to pour rain or hail outside for all the racket; it took me looking out there in daylight to determine what I was actually hearing. 4) VERY THIN WALLS. I was lucky to be sharing my floor with considerate guests, I think, but I was still able to hear my neighbours' TVs blaring quite often, and I could hear every snore coming from the room to my left each night. Again, if you're sensitive to noise, I'd recommend bringing ear plugs. Planes to and from Gatwick also seem to have a flightpath directly above, so earplugs aren't a bad idea anyway! 5) NO PHONES AND NO INTERNET ACCESS IN THE ROOMS. It is possible to hook up to a free wifi signal from your room if you're tenacious enough (try connecting via free-internet.com or free-hotspot), but the connection only lasts a short time before you're bumped offline and have to trudge through the process again. The reference made on the hotel's website to \"free internet available in public areas\" seems to be referring to the solo desktop computer situated in a corner of the lobby. As for the aforememtioned telephones, if you're not originally from the UK or don't already own a mobile, you'll need either a cheap pay-as-you-go cell phone, or a calling card which you can use in one of the two phone boxes across the road and down the street. (I don't recommend doing that at night, however. Like other reviewers, I was surprised to discover how many \"unsavoury\" sorts will harass you if you're in those phone boxes after about 10 p.m.) 6) THE LIFT. It's very rickety and a little bit scary, actually, even to someone who doesn't have issues with such things! It's incredibly small, and very slow, which must be why management has posted a sign limiting the number of people who are allowed to use the lift with luggage in hand to 3. My room was the second one in, so I could only barely hear the creaking/banging/doors grinding shut, but I heard the gentleman in the room between mine and the lift complaining about it keeping him awake at night. Be mindful of that if you're booking - request a room away from the lift if you can. Whew. I really hope that was helpful, for all of my blathering! There are other, smaller complaints - the dusty and stale packages of coffee/tea in the room, the wall lamp meant for reading that wasn't working, and the fact that you have to pay between \u00c2\u00a31-\u00c2\u00a32 if you want a bottle of water from the fridge in the lobby - but I mainly wanted to get into the stuff that would be a dealbreaker to a lot of travellers. This is less a hotel and more a HOSTEL, but at a cost you'd expect to pay for a Travelodge or Premier Inn, ones with normal bathrooms that don't jut out into the room and smell terrible, and access to a telephone! The place was completely full, a big No Vacancies sign on the door even mid-week, for my entire 3-night stay, so clearly the accomodations are acceptable enough to stay well in business. Bottom line, for me: It's badly misrepresented, costs far too much for what you get, and would appeal more to teenagers or college kids who are accustomed to backpacking/using hostels than it would to anyone in *any* other demographic.

Also the coach station & train station are close enough to walk to without any problem. There are some lovely pubs & restaurants near by & I would heartily recomend the St Georges Tavern for a reasonably priced meal & a drink. Me & my daughter stayed in room 200. We had origionaly booked a twin but somehow ended up with a double, but it was no problem for us & we turned down an offer to change rooms the next day as this room had a fantastic balcony with a view over the street. We found the room to be clean & compact but certainly big enough for us two & our shoes! The bathroom was a bit of a joke however, small didnt really describe it. We use to have a touring caravan & Im fairly sure the bathroom in it was bigger! Never the less there was a loo, sink & shower & it was clean & served us well for our 3 night stay. Plenty of clean towels changed daily, but sadly no soap...random! The maid came in every day & made the bed, cleaned round ect... all very good. There were tea&coffee making facilities & a hairdryer & a shaver point for anybody who might need one. The breakfast was included in the price of the room & was a continental offering, cerials, toast & jams, cheese, tea, coffee & juice. A full English was available for just \u00c2\u00a34 & you could pay the waitress on the day if you felt the need to have one. We found the staff to be very friendly & they had maps & such in reception if you needed one.

We were two women (aged 18 & 39) & we used the hotel mainly to sleep in as we spent all day sight seeing & we ate out everynight, we loved it & would definately stay there again.

The reception area looked good, and although the staff member that served us appeared to want to be somewhere else, he did halfheartedly show us to our room and we were given very vague directions to get to the dining room for breakfast in the morning. Unfortunately it went downhill from there, as we had been given room no:116 which was in the basement. The room itself was clean and tidy and although the door to the ensuite shower room needed a good push to get it to stay it shut! It was a reasonable size and the shower appeared to be quite a new installment. The double bed was very comfortable and had my husband and I fallen out, we had the benefit of an extra single bed in the room. The TV on the wall worked and we were supplied with tea and coffee facilities, clean towels and a hairdryer, but were surprised to have no complimentary toiletries available or a lid on the soap despenser on the sink. However the best was yet to come, on returning to the hotel to sleep that night we were very pleased to find it lovely and quiet, however this only lasted until 06:30 in the morning when we were disturbed by lots of scraping and banging from the room next door. On leaving our room at 07:30 to go and have breakfast the noise had got louder, but again we just assumed that the kitchen had got busier. My husband and I then went up the stairs and through the hotel as we had been advised to do so by the receptionist the night before. On arriving at the dining room, we found it unwelcoming and there were no staff around, we sat there a little dazed and eventually we gave up on the idea of breakfast and resided ourselves to just having toast, especially when we realised that we needed cash to pay the extra to have the fry up as we had already fully paid for our room and so couldn't have it charged to it (this annoyed us greatly as I had specifically asked the evening before whether we had too prepay for our breakfast or not, etc and had been told that that it was fine to just pay in the morning). My husband and I then got up to leave the dining room and noticed that there was an extra door out of the dining room at the other end to the one we had entered, we then noticed that it directed us to our door number this way, so we left that way, AND ON GOING THROUGH THE DOOR WE WERE GREETED BY THE DOOR TO OUR ROOM BEING IMMEDIATELY ON THE LEFT!!! meaning that the noise we had heard earlier had been diners moving about and scraping chairs, etc. This really annoyed us and we would never stay here again, especially as we feel that the staff had deliberately kept this information from us, as not only was the sign missing from the door, but we had been directed the other way to the dining room the night before.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cork", "Title": "\u201cWould not stay there again\u201d", "Author": "mary_horgan2002", "ReviewID": "UR96699375", "Content": "Arrived on Saturday 12th Feb 2011 and first impressions of hotel were not bad.

On booking I was looking for a budget hotel with 3 stars and a suitable location to get to the centre of London with ease. On reading the write up on the website I thought I had found th ideal place. However on arriving at the hotel I was a little dissapointed with what greeted me. The room was tiny. A double room with just enough room to walk around the edge of the bed. The ensuite bathroom was an obvious add on as this room looked to have been non-ensuite initially. The ensuite itself was tiny too. Very plasticy and prefab feeling to it. My partner likened it to being in a bathroom on a plane! The shower had barely enough room and the water was only luke warm and given it being the end of November, it wasnt the best shower I'd ever had. The breakfast was basic to say the least. Dried up sausages, passable scrambled egg, cold beans, and the coffee/tea machine had packed in not to mention the watered down \"fresh\" orange juice. All I can say on a positive note is that the hotel staff were friendly and the rooms were clean. Howver given the facilities offered and the standard of the rooms I am strugging to see how the hotel has achieved a 3-star rating. I had a glance at the tarrif at the main desk while I was checking in.
