It is a modern and solid 4-star hotel. We were given a triple-room, facing a quiet yet sunny back patio. The space was very adequate (not enormous, but not tiny a la London, either) for the three of us. The bathroom was quite modern with separate tub and glass-enclosed shower (the water pressure in the shower was memorable!), all beds were quite solid (as we like them, although some people could find them too hard), and the in-room safe deposit box could comfortably accommodate a laptop computer. Very clean, rooms were serviced satisfactorily every day. The desk staff were very correct and corteous without becoming annoyingly obsequious. Although the reception desk seemed to always have custormers, they nevertheless took the time to give us indications to restaurants, to move around town, to secure a taxi back to the airport, all without any attitude. Our rate did not include breakfast (at about Euro 10 or 12 per person, it did not look appetizing....) yet there are bars and caf\u00e9s (one run by a Chinese family right accross the street) when you can be like the locals and have your caf\u00e9 con leche plus croissant for about 2 to 3 euros. As to the \"negatives\" (if you must insist on a \"balanced\" view....): I cannot think of its location as a negative, although some people insist on being on top of the action and this hotel certainly is not. It is located 2 to 3 blocks away from the Tetuan metro station and the main buses. Unless you like 30 minute walks, you will need to take public transportation from the hotel to get to the main Barcelona areas of attraction (Passeig de Gracia, Ramblas, Born, Barceloneta, Raval, Sagrada Familia) as well as the better restaurants. Yet, we were very happy every night to come back to the quiet of our hotel and not be in a room deep in the noise of the above areas. The only item that needs improvement is the wi-fi. It is offered, it is free, but uneven and weak. The hotel provides its guests, on a first-come first-served basis, of ethernet cables to get a hardwire connection in your room, and then everything is fine, albeit somewhat slow from what it is expected from a hard-wired connection. Make sure to inquire about your cable early in the morning, when departing guests return theirs. Nevertheless, a note of caution here: there are two telephone sockets in the room where you can plug the ethernet cable. You should use the even numbered socket for Internet. The odd number socket is for telephony and, like another reviewer found out the hard way, could lead to extra charges.

Nonetheless it was brightened up by the first day\u2019s hotels receptionists. Hotel was clean and superb, but one thing they do not provide is a kettle/flask. It is troublesome if you want to make a hot drink, because you have to call the room service for it. On one of the nights, we had to go down to the cafeteria to fetch the flask of hot water ourselves. The cafeteria was actually quite empty except for one customer, and yet we were told they were busy. We also realized that the electrical switch converter that we brought could not fit into their electrical outlets so we asked the receptionist if they could provide us with one. From our experience other hotels could easily provide a converter for us if we had brought the wrong one. When we asked them, we were quickly given a no answer and our request was treated quite dismissively a bit too fast. We felt there were no genuine attempts to help us out. In the end we had to stake out Barcelona and source for the converter ourselves by combing through the streets of Barcelona. The hotel was situated at a quiet street, so we being two girls there were times we felt worried when we were walking back to the hotel at night so it pays to take precautionary measures. But since the hotel is situated away from the tourist area, so therefore you can sleep in peace at night. The nearest metro would be Tetuan (Purple, L2), followed by Arc de Triomf (Red, L1). Finally, the last day we forgot to bring our second camera, we did not put it in the safe, and the cleaning lady apparently went in to clean the room because we did not put up the \u2018do not disturb\u2019 sign, but then when we came back everything is still intact. We felt really thankful that nothing untoward happened given the numerous warning about items that other travelers have lost which they unintentionally left it in their hotels around Barcelona.

The city looks somewhat like a milder climate Z\u00fcrich: lots of tree lined streets and avenues, ultra clean and green environment, efficient transit system. + architecture is mesmerizingly beautiful and the locals are rather friendly and easygoing. Hotel Ayre Caspe is perfectly in line with this description of the city. a nice modern, clean, quiet hotel with excellent service and a tasty breakfast buffet to boot. The seafront is a 25mn stroll from the hotel, and the nearest underground station (Arc de Triumf) is a leisurely 5 mn walk from the hotel.

The location is not bad, however there are other hotels at a similar distance to the central part of Barcelona that you can find at a better price. I personally wasn't very happy with the walking distance to Las Ramblas or Passeig de Gracia which were not less than 20 min of intense walking away. There were not many homeless people in the area (which seems to be a problem for Barcelona), however I found out that you can see them just about everywhere, so it is inevitable to run into one. One guy was sleeping in the entrance of the bank just opposite the hotel... So here are the pros and cons: Pros: - Clean room, spacious and modern. - My room wasn't on the street, so it was pretty quiet, though you could clearly hear people talking in the corridors and doors opening and closing. No noise from neighboring rooms though. Cons: - Internet, which was free of charge, was very difficult to connect to. I had to move my laptop around in order to get online. In addition the connection was not fast enough, but I was let to believe that you don't get good internet in hotels in Barcelona anyway. - As already mentioned the distance to main shopping and entertainment areas is not as short as it seems on the map. Though 20-30 minutes walk can get you to Las Ramblas, Passeig de Gracia or La Sagrada Familia, remember that it can be very hot in Barcelona.You could of course use the public transport which is very convenient and reliable and there are bus stops nearby. If you prefer taxi, it's just better to book a room in one of the more central hotels as taxi rates seem to be very high in Barcelona (even for people like me coming from Scandinavia). - The staff, though polite was not very good when it comes to giving you the right directions. - You should be careful when checking out. There was a slight problem with my payment, they reserved the money on my credit card twice, though they tried to convince me that it was not the case. The hotel released the money after few days, however that created a problem for me. - My last objection is to the breakfast which was not included in the price and seems to be something you should avoid. But, for the price we are paying I believe one should get breakfast, no matter good or bad. To summarize, I would recommend the hotel to people that don't mind long walks and/or public transportation. I would stay there again, but only in case I am unable to find the same quality(and similar distance) hotel at a cheaper price.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cVery nice!\u201d", "Author": "bjimenez12", "ReviewID": "UR82614057", "Content": "Stayed in this hotel for 3 days while in Barcelona.

It was so small you could not move around the bed without tripping over it. However, as requested it was quiet. Since we were staying in the hotel for seven days we asked if we could move to a larger room but with the same view. Despite being told that the hotel was very busy we were given an opportunity to check out three other rooms. All hotel rooms we saw were decorated in the same very spartan style. When we selected our room we found it to be very clean and extremely quiet and had a magnificent view of la Sagrada Familia. We had the hotel book us a day tour of a local winery and visit to Montserrat. We were assigned an excellent tour guide who also helped us find a wonderful country restaurant for lunch. Location of the hotel was perfect for catching the subway and for attending a conference located nearby. We had a large number of restaurants to choose from in the area. We enjoyed daily breakfast at the hotel. It consisted of a variety of hot and cold dishes with plenty of fresh fruit. Eggs were prepared for us in any style we requested. When we checked out of the hotel our request for a vehicle large enough to carry five individuals with successes was honored.

We chose it mainly because it offered a room at relatively low price, and seemed to be a modern and clean hotel. The hotel is located on a quiet side street of Gran Via and is bit far from everything, though still in the center. It was actually a little hard to find the hotel in the first place, because looking from the map, I had estimated it to be a lot closer to its nearest metro station 'Monumental'. Anyhow, the hotel is accessible by metro. There isn't anything badly wrong with the hotel or its rooms, but the overall feel is a little shabby, worn-out and IKEA-like and hence it most certainly isn't four star standard. The room minibar was filled with complimentary spring water, but so it is in most BCN hotels these days. I mean, with the same price, you can find better hotels with better location in BCN.

The Hotel Ayre Caspe, however, is situated away from the hurley burley of the city, yet within comfortable walking distance of two metro stations Tetuan and Arc de Triomf - both of which are within easy access of the main Ramblas district. The hotel itself is 4* and is very chic in its presentation. It is built round a great glass courtyard (a little reminiscent of the film The Matrix in a strange way). The staff were very courteous and accommodating (although our holiday was so problem free we only saw them at check in and check out). The room was the standard hotel room - the beds were hardish but I prefer them that way, the TV showed the Olympics, the curtains gave near blackout in the morning and the shower was excellent. Food is not included in the package and seems rather expensive if you do want to eat at the hotel. Every morning I made the 1 minute walk to the local cafe and had a cafe con leche and toast or croisant at a table outside watching the world go by - very cheap and very good service (Cafe Sol d'Or). Getting round Barcelona is so easy. best value is to buy a T10 at the ticket machine which entitles you or your party 10 trips. During our stay my wife and I had a ticket each (actually 3 as there is so much to see) and on the last day we bought one and passed it backwards and forwards across the ticket reading machine - the ticket is designed for this purpose. It also allows you on the fantastic bus service and the train from the airport to the tube station Sants Estacio. We bought a Bus Touristic pack from the hotel for 3 Euros per pack with the intention of going on one of the tours of the city. In the end we didn't but the money was recouped by presenting the tokens at all the sites (including some food places) and it saved us money in the end - probably about 10Euros each. Eating out was great but as Barcelona is a world city, not cheap. There are the usual MacDonalds etc but two restaurants we found were Agua on the beach near the Olympic village - gorgeous setting but you must book as it is so popular, and a little restaurant just off Las Ramblas - Sinatras lovely food and great service. One night we went for a meal at Taberna Barca on the Ramblas - avoid at all costs the wine cost 21 Euros for house wine and the chicken was wings with more gristle and skin than meat! On our last day we went to Fresc Co - all you can eat for 9.95. It reminded me of a school canteen: noisy, crowded, lots of tasteless carbohydrates (no meat that I could see) Pizza pieces (actually the only part that I enjoyed) but hey-ho each to his own and it filled my stomach ready for the flight back home. If you want some culture in the evenings - theatre, opera, concerts - choose any months other than July and August as all the theatres close for the summer.

We arrived quite early from our cruise ship and took a cab to the hotel, which seemed to be in the middle of nowhere. The lobby was very large, modern and sparsely furnished - no warmth at all, and I don't mean the temperature. Check-in was a breeze. I had anticipated problems because of the early hour of our arrival, but there were none. We were given a room immediately. The room was spacious by European standards, and clean. But the bed was hard, and when I asked if they could do anything to help, such as an eggcrate topper, I was brusquely told \"no.\" One of the reasons for choosing this hotel was price, which was lower due to the location. The other was that it offered free in-room Wi-fi. This was a necessity, since my husband absolutely had to do some work. We were dismayed to find that it never worked during both nights of our stay, not in the room and not in the lobby. The people at the desk weren't apologetic, and just plain didn't care. We were happy to see that there was an internet cafe right across the street, but when my husband went there, he couldn't believe that it was Chinese - ALL Chinese: management, customers, and keyboards! On our long walk toward the Ramblas we found two more internet cafes, but they, too, were strictly Chinese. We were in Barcelona two years ago and had no trouble finding one, but apparently immigration has been ramped up! We finally found one that he could use, but it was just to send an email to his boss explaining why he couldn't do what he was supposed to be doing. He needed his own computer to connect to the U.S. government's secure website. On our second day we left our room at 10:00 a.m. and didn't return until late in the evening. We found that our room had not been cleaned AT ALL! I went downstairs to the desk and was met with the same lack of concern and again, no apology. The guy simply handed us a couple of clean towels. We had not paid for the room in advance, just booked online with a 35 Euro deposit with the booking service the hotel uses. The next morning at checkout we asked for a reduction on our bill due to the necessary wi-fi not being provided and our room not being cleaned. No way, Jose. They would not budge, and offered nothing as compensation. We refused to sign the charge slip, but they had the info and we have just gotten the bill with the full amount charged. We are now disputing the charge. Yes, certainly we should pay for the two nights we stayed, but I believe that we are owed something for all the trips down to the desk to deal with the wi-fi issue, plus the lack of maid service. Sure it's a foreign country and wouldn't have ended this way in the U.S., but Spain's a modern country and this is inexcusable. About the neighborhood: I read so many reviews about the Ayre Caspe on Trip Advisor and there was much written about the neighborhood - some people saying it was dicey and others reporting that they felt safe. While we didn't like the location due to its distance from the main Plaza, the Ramblas, and other sites in the city, there is absolutely no reason to fear it. It's a residential neighborhood, lots of apartment houses, not unpleasant to look at, and completely safe. We walked it day and night, and even walked back at 1:00 a.m. from the Ramblas, a long trek. The streets weren't full of people, but there were no muggers or suspicious-looking characters, either. Fear of the neighborhood shouldn't stop you from staying here.

We used the Metro to get around Barcelona and found it fantastic and used it as late at 1130pm. The reception area is impressive when you enter and looks very new and modern. We were situated on the top floor and although the room wasnt very big is was modern and clean. The downside was that they advertise soundproof walls and even if someone coughs in the hallway it sounds as though they are in your room as it does when someone showers in the room next to you. This isnt so bad if you get up before 7am however otherwise you will be woken up with the noise. The temperature in the room was boiling, and this was in january when it was only 17 degrees outside in the day and around 5 at night. We turned the air con onto full power at the coolest possible and it was still warm although manageable. This was made worase by the fact the every night they switched the power off so no air con, no lights etc at about 1am. The last awful part was the bar, but only was it quiet most nights. The night we went for a drink at 10pm when 3 other guests were there drinking, including one being served when we arrived and the close hours being 11pm we were refused a drink as they said they were closed. We were not drunk as my husband had had 2 glasses of wine and me being pregnant I'd had none and only wanted a fanta or lemonade before going to bed. We found this very rude.

As noted by others the bathroom was well fitted with a walk-in shower plus a tub with full shower; excellent water pressure and hot water. The front-desk staff were excellent, on check-in they didn't have my reservation (made directly on their Web site) but it took two minutes and everything was fine. We had planned on staying a total of six nights but after the first night we had to return home due to sickness, the desk agent was extremely solicitous and handled our check-out with no fuss or muss. The bar and restaurant are small and appear almost an afterthought, and the night we were there poorly patronized. We were the only people in the dining room the whole evening. The food while not particularly adventurous was good and not unreasonably priced (the breakfast at Euro14 seemed high and so we intended skipping that). With the outstanding bedroom facilities but limited bar/restaurant It struck me as more of a business hotel than a tourist hotel; I'd be curious as to the original demographic target. We thought the location was pretty good, a little of the main track but a 15 to 20 minute walk to Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya and the start of La Rambla or a five minute walk to Arc de Triomf and the Metro stop. Slightly tangential but my advice is to not take the train from the airport and then Metro, but take the Aeroporta express but to Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya and then either walk or take a taxi to the hotel. Barcelona's Metro is the most unfriendly system I have encountered in a long time. To get from Barcelona-Sants Train Station to Arc de Triomf by Metro is a nightmare, endless stairs up and down (which with luggage is hard work), no escalator (actually just one), endless walks through subterranean tunnels and poor signage. There is supposedly a city train connecting Barcelona-Sants and Arc de Triomf but we couldn't find it and no one we asked was able to help; we must have phrased the question poorly I think.

The bed was nice and comfortable and I liked the fact that the room was not carpeted but done up in parquet / faux parquet. Bathroom was large and the bath and shower areas were separate from each other. Toiletries provided were more than adequate and their soap in particular was a very interesting translucent yellow (frivolous but it just shows the hotel's attention to detail to ensure that the entire package was consistent). We found it difficult to work the air conditioning on the first night but a call to reception solved our problem. Like most hotels in Barcelona, breakfast was only provided at an additional cost of EUR14 per person per night. We decided not to take it. We really liked the location of the hotel because of its proximity to the Estacio del Nord, which is where the Barcelona Bus arrives from and departs to Girona Airport.

Only negative note, some rooms do not have a window open to the outside but open to the interior of the hotel, so you cannot have a lot of privacy unless you keep the courtains always close, personally i didn't mind it but to someone the very simple idea of not being able to get a breath of fresh air from outside could make of it a bit suffocating experience. By the way, for a sort of compensation, these rooms are quite larger than the ones with the window open to the outside. The hotel is very new and designed in a modern and elegant fashion that may not appeal to someone (the colours of the interior like hall and corridors, meeting rooms and restaurant, are very ...cold: mainly white, grey and black , with a lot of steel and glass and alluminium, like a large office) the opposite of the traditional old Hotels that are always in red, orange and the warm colours of wood, but don't worry as you enter in you room you'll find everything elegant and at the same time warm and very very confortable. Having breakfast at the Caspe Ayre is a kind of experience you will be very happy and eager to repeat every morning: fresh good smelling coffee,fresh fruits, eggs and bacon well shown and properly done, a huge variety of breads and pastries, cold meats like salami and ham and , if you haven't drank enough the nigth before, even a glass of champagne to give the day a sparkling start.... the only oddity was the selection of food in the weekend differing sligthly from that of working days; if this sound strange it will sound even stranger that on weekends the restaurant is closed (at least it was when I was there), well any country has its own peculiarities and you have better to check in advance.

Overall this hotel was not bad value for money but it certainll lacked something for me.", "Date": "September 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood Find!\u201d", "Author": "mikey393", "ReviewID": "UR5357284", "Content": "Just returned from a 3 night business trip to Barcelona.

First time in Barcelona and have to say that the Caspe was top class considering the price. Rooms were spotlessly clean and well appointed. Did not use the restaurant so cannot comment on this. The Hotel is not central to the major touristy bits but is only a 20 mins or so walk from either the Marina area or Ramblas.

There were 4 of us and we had 2 rooms on the 5th floor of the Caspe. We will be recommending this hotel to our friends as at least one other couple will be travelling to Barcelona in the near future. The beds were comfortable and while the rooms were small they were nicely appointed with ample cupboard space and a handy nook in between the head of the bed and the window for storing empty suitcases and golf clubs. Also appreciated the room safe for our valuables. (Golf courses are way out of town. If you really want to golf perhaps stay out in the country somewhere.) While the hotel was indeed 9 blocks from the Placa Catalunya we bought the 10 ride metro pass and walked the 3 blocks down C. de Naples to the Arc de Triomf Metro just about every day. On the way to the metro we often stopped at the Oriol Bakery, about half a block from the hotel on Naples for breakfast when we didn't feel like the large breakfast buffet that was available at the hotel. We occasionally took cabs at the end of the day when we had worn out our feet and usually the cab drivers knew the hotel. When they didn't \"the corner of Napols and Casp\" was all they needed to know to get us home. Barcelona is such a lovely city and with things to see on every block of every avenue and every side street in the city center you will not be bored. You will cover miles without realizing it. We can recommend the Italian restaurant on the Placa de Tetuan (sorry, I neglected to write down the name but it is at about the 8 o'clock position of that round-about if 12 is at the north) and Ququ which is just north of Casp on Gracia. Also quite enjoyed Gino's on Via Laietana just south of Fontanella and the 7 Portes and Los Caracoles. Final note, beware of pickpockets. I had left my purse unzipped and had a very close encounter as I came out of the Arc de Triomphe metro but apparently they are everywhere. Because of pick-pockets I left my passport in the room safe but a photocopy of the front page in your purse would be good for Tax Back info or in case you are stopped by the police. Apparently that happens sometimes in Spain although it never happened to us.

On arrival the atmosphere was very friendly and professional from the receptionists, and I didn't sense the smell of mildew at all(as one reviewer pointed out). Our room was on the top floor and was sparkling clean with all mod cons, as shown in a previous reviewers pictures. There was no problem with noise from the street below and on the third night of our stay we slept soundly through a major storm! We did not pay for the breakfast, thinking 14 euros was a little expensive(and not within our budget!) and so instead went to the little supermarkets and cafes within the area. I did not feel that far away from the centre of Barcelona, as other reviewers have commented and felt that the area was quiet at night but not unsafe. I really enjoyed my stay at the Fiesta Caspe, and was surprised it was so cheap for (what was advertised as) a four star hotel.", "Date": "March 29, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ayre Hotel Caspe", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d305584-Reviews-Ayre_Hotel_Caspe-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$124 - $197*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">C/ Caspe 103</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08013</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> (Formerly Fiesta Hotel Caspe)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "305584", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/0d/40/0d40d34250b8dca548793724f1f411314large.jpg"}}
