{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Wonderful new bungallow! We`ve been staying in this resort many many times over the last 8 years.Coming to Bali, about 4 times a year ,from Tokyo,this is for us the perfect place to relax .This is Bali at his best.The hotel is surrounded by rice fields,right in front of the sea...What makes me write about it this time,is the wonderful new bungallow they built right in top of the cliff.At night it it felt like we were in the middle of the ocean.My wife and i can`t remember a more peaceful and romantic place...My wife was so excited about the massage she got on their new spa,that i basically had to get one too!The staff is lovely and the food is great....Overall,its just a wonderful experience,and i`m sure you`ll enjoy it as much as we did!", "Date": "Nov 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR589575872", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "stephjapon"}, {"Content": "New 'Honeymoon' Villa A Winner! I stayed a couple of nights at your hotel again recently, and this time took advantage of the new 'honeymoon' bungalow on the headland. What a great location, with stunning views both ways along the coast and inland to the mountains - a breathtaking vista, and so dramatic when a tropical thunderstorm swept by. Quite unforgettable. It is just a little isolated out on the headland, but, with the spa-bath overlooking the ocean below, it is just perfect for 'honeymoon' activities. One can make as much noise as is necessary without the concern of disturbing ones neighbours. This new building is a great asset to what has long been a favourite get-away spot for me on Bali.I shall return!", "Date": "Nov 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR575380865", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MrRoger"}, {"Content": "Great potential, but SERIOUS issues       Honeymoon villa sitting behind massage building", "Date": "Nov 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR476212270", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "binaryeric"}, {"Content": "Peaceful and lovely Gajah Mina is a lovely small resort in western Bali. Only a handful of private villas and a gorgeous central pool. The beach next to the resort is just fabulous - huge and deserted. But it is more for surfers and not great for swimming.The staff at the hotel are very sweet and accommodating and you must not miss the house soup - just delicious. The restaurant offers some really great fresh food.Overall great value for money and somewhere I would return to without hesitation.", "Date": "Jun 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR498087129", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "kparsnip"}, {"Content": "Lovely and relaxed What a great and lovely place!

It is a very friendly and relaxed resort, making it an excellent place to simply chill out. The beach is no good for bathing, but is deserted and great for long walks. The pool is nice, although we got little use due to poor weather during our stay.The rooms are basic but comfortableand the outdoor shower is a nice touch.Food in the restaurant was very good and decent value - which is just as well as there's no where else to go in close proximity.If you just want to get away from the grind of everyday life then Gajah Mina is just the ticket - I would definitely visit again.", "Date": "Jan 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR386456817", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Justinmod"}, {"Content": "Soooo Beautiful What a beautiful hotel, my fiancee and I stayed here during our recent trip to Bali, Great food, great service, beautiful bungalows, had such a wonderful time, many thanks to the owner Dominique who made us feel so welcome.", "Date": "Jul 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR473951147", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "escapism"}, {"Content": "An Amazing Hotel Gajah Mina is an amazing hotel.
