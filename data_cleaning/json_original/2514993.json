Our double room was not too big but the rooms are beautifully decorated and the bed so comfortable - great pillows and perfect mattress. Very clean bathroom with nice big bath. Lovely attention in the evening by the bed -bottles of water and chocolates. We also found the rooms very warm but once we switched off the heating it was fine. The hotel is quiet at night, we slept so well. Breakfast was fine but pricey. At checkout thought, to our surprise the manager very kindly offered a lower rate to all of us (we were 3 couples) on the breakfast, as well as he gave a special price to one of the couples who had a more expensive room than the rest (when booking it was the only one available) so that we all pay the same price. Very attentive of him, and very appreciated by the 6 of us ! The rest of the staff was as attentive, friendly and welcoming as the manager.

The location was great with the Eiffel Tower, Arch d Triumph and Champs Elysses within short walks. The temperature in our room tended to be uncomfortably warm. This was mitigated by turning off the heat and opening the windows. This worked well as the hotel is located on a quiet street.

In general the hotel was ok and the pricing could say acceptable if you consider its Paris. Don't expect anything fancy etc, it\u2019s just a regular hotel located in a quiet street (the back rooms not recommended as the very dark and depressing). The area where the breakfast is served is in the basement and very dark again, I would not recommend b\u2019fast at this hotel (but note nothing located near by serving anything better). We had a small problem with our lock but the hotel gave us a regular key instead of a card key so nothing bad abt that\u2026 The room was acceptable and size ok for a w/e stay. Over all it was clean and the bathroom as well. We would have chosen this hotel again in the future (although we like to try others as well) if it wasent for the last minute rip off! On the day of our departure we asked from the front desk to arrange a taxi for the airport. When we walked out the door there was no regular taxi waiting but your privet ride. I specifically told the front desk that I want a regular taxi as I don't want to pay extra for private car etc. Hotel front desk assured me that the cost would be the same as a regular taxi. (For your guidance when we arrived we took from the airport a taxi that charged us 35\u20ac with the meter running plus some extra \u20ac for the luggage and I give the taxi 40\u20ac). When we arrived to the airport the private ride driver requested from me 68\u20ac !!! and please note that their was ZERO traffic on our way to the airport. So I then told the driver my arrival fair...and he was shocked. To cut a long story short I paid 50\u20ac to driver and he left angry without even saying thank you etc. I was misled and mistreated by the hotel personnel and that is unacceptable. This line out my frustration and off course I don't plan to visti this hotel ever again. It's not a mater about 20/30\u20ac its about being straight.

The check in process was incredibly smooth and quick and the manager made us feel at home immediately. Perfect service. Our bags were taken upstairs for us (in the elevator by the stairs hidden by a fake bookcase!) and we were so impressed by the room.

I travelled with my wife and another couple. All in all, I liked the hotel, some aspects very much so, but there were a few downsides and I wasn't quite as happy with it all as I had hoped. Here are the highlights and lowlights: * The room. We had an Executive Room. The furnishings were lovely - great colors, comfortable bed, elegant furniture. It's not an especially large room, but few in Paris are and the size was perfectly comfortable for the two of us. All in all, we really liked the room. Our friends booked a suite, and I would say it was definitely not worth the extra money. It was larger overall, with a sitting area, but still not very big, and for most folks visiting Paris, who really needs that when you are spending most of the day and evening out on the town. For an extra $300/night, splurge on food, wine, or other activities and stick with the Executive Room. * Quiet and convenient location. A nice quiet street, but only a block from the Champs Elysee, Ave George V, and the metro. I love the Arc, so appreciated being close and getting a great view of it every morning and evening. We had a room facing the interior courtyard, and so had no street noise whatsoever despite being on the 2nd floor. Note: on our last day they were starting construction across the street - ask if that is still going on, and if so ask for an interior room. * Nice to have a small bar on the lobby level, though I never saw anyone there so it felt a little dead. We weren't looking for a lot of noise or action, but having a few people around would have added some life. Limited selection of beers and wines. * The breakfast room in the basement is very cozy, comfortable, and convenient. The breakfast was good enough, certainly plenty of food, though costly. The basket of pastries was decent, and we loved the yogurts and cheeses, but the microwave eggs and potatoes at the buffet bar left something to be desired. * Most of the staff were friendly and helpful, but I have to say that we found the concierges to be highly lacking. Before the trip, I sent the concierge an e-mail asking for advice on restaurants (I offered names of a few places I had heard about and wanted his impressions), asked for advice on transport from the airport to the hotel, and a couple of other small questions. Got no response for three days, and had to follow up with two more e-mails. Finally got a response, which was that he booked us three reservations (for the wrong number of people), didn't give any feedback on the restaurant names I asked about, and didn't provide any advice on airport transportation. I had to send yet another e-mail asking him to please respond to the questions that I had actually asked, which finally prompted some useful feedback. My second gripe with the concierge was that their restaurant recommendations were seriously lame. They suggested places that were HIGHLY touristy with average food (we had Zagats and Michelin guides), and only within about an 8-block radius. Nothing great, nothing especially interesting, nothing that we wanted to go to. If there is one thing that concierges in Paris should be knowledgeable about, it's restaurants. And, finally, in general I found the concierges made me feel like I was bothering them when I asked for assistance. They always were willing to help, but just gave off the vibe that it was a hassle. For a hotel of this level, I'd expect a concierge who knows what they are talking about and is ready to serve. They could do a lot better. As noted, other staff were professional and very pleasant. * Shower water heat was highly variable, and often went from very warm to very cool and then back again. Not exactly what you'd expect at a hotel of this caliber. * There is a yoga studio right next door, if you are into that sort of thing, * Free WiFi in the lobby, but a relatively weak signal so hard to use the internet because it ran very slowly. You must pay for Wi Fi in your room. Would I recommend it to a friend - I guess so, but with reservations. Would I stay there again - probably not.

We enjoyed our stay however we will probably consider other hotels on future visits to Paris. First the positive aspects of our stay - 1. Location: The hotel's location cannot be beat. It is only a few steps from the Champs-Elysees and the George V metro stop which made getting around in the city very easy. There are plenty of dinining options within waling distance of the hotel. In additon, the Arc de Triomphe is a short 5-10 minute walk away. 2. Service: The hotel's staff (particularly the dining room staff) is great and went out of their way to be of service. Whether it was providing directions to area sites or answering general questions about Paris the hotel staff was a pleasure to deal with and always helpful. 3. Breakfast: The hotel had a terrific breakfast each morning. The selection and quality was outstanding and was a great way to start the day. Now for the down side to our stay: 1. We stayed in room 502. While the room was nicely decorated and furnished we experienced several problems. First, the water in the shower routinely alternated between very hot and very cold each day. At first we thought this may have been a fluke with many people using the showers in the hotel at the same time. After it happened every day and at varying times during the day we realized it was a problem. While it was not a huge deal it was very inconvenient and should not have been an issue in a hotel such as the Francois 1er. 2. The walls in the hotel room are very thin - so much so that we were awakened four out of six nights by noise coming from the guests in the adjacent rooms. While I understand you cannot eliminate all noises we were able to hear every word of conversations (and one heated argument) happening next door. For this reason it was difficult to get a good night sleep on most nights during our stay. After doing a tremendous amount of sight seeing (and walking) we truly valued a good night of sleep. Unfortunately, we were not able to get much during our stay. For these reasons we will probably consider staying at another hotel the next time we are in Paris. If, however, the hotel could remedy the hot/cold water issue and provide some better sound insullation between the rooms we would be thrilled to return.", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "tampa florida USA", "Title": "\u201cProbably the best value in Paris in its' price range\u201d", "Author": "tampaboy9", "ReviewID": "UR39932468", "Content": "While some don't attach much importance to a hotel past a place to sleep a few hours each night, others consider the hotel part of the vacation experience and they enjoy having an attractive room, a good staff, a good location, a good buffet breakfast and other amenities which make their stay memorable.

We spent 6 nights at the Francois 1er the last week in August, 2009, and agree with the huge majority of guests who rated the hotel excellent or very good. We booked an executive room which was comparable in size to a standard room in a typical hotel in the USA owned by a big hotel chain. (But large by usual Paris measurements) The hotel is located in a safe, clean, and quiet area. It is just steps to Avenue George V which intersects the Champs des Elysees around 200 or so meters away. It is about 100 meters away to the nearest Bus stop on Avenue Marceau. We found the Bus a good way to get around while viewing beautiful scenery along way, which is not seen on the RER or the Metro. You can buy single ride tickets from the bus driver for about 1.3 Euros each. The nearest Metro stop is The George V located on the Champ des Elysees at the corner of Bassano. Cash machines are in all directions from the hotel a short walk away. Housekeeping at the hotel is immaculate. The restrooms next to the little public bar are spotless and have a fresh soft terry cloth hand towel for each comer. Sure beats the tiny paper towels seen elsewhere. When we returned to our room in the afternoon the maids always had everything straightened up, and the marble bath was shining like a diamond. They cheerfully brought more towels when requested. Breakfast at the cozy little dining room was one of the daily high points of our stay. The buffet which was included with the room when we booked at GTAhotels.com was delightful. Beautifully displayed were many types of delicious cheeses, meats such as ham, Canadian bacon, and smoked sausages, a dozen or so types of bread, rolls and pastries, fresh fruit salad, fresh apples, oranges, cereals like corn flakes and others, fresh squeezed fruit juices, boiled and scrambled eggs, and more offerings that I don\u2019t remember offhand. And it was all delicious. Now the staff. They were always smiling, polite, and helpful. One example is when we arrived in the early morning from a long overnight flight from the USA like most do. Normal check in time is after 1:00 PM, and they would have been well within their rights to politely tell us to come back several hours later. But they didn\u2019t. Our room wasn\u2019t ready so they offered to move us into an alternate room which was ready, and they would move us the next day to our designated room. Since we needed a nap and a little cleaning up we accepted their offer willingly. We felt like we had been delivered. Other examples were when they made phone calls to locate a couple of places we wanted to go. This is a first class hotel just a step down from the half a dozen or so luxurious palace level hotels in Paris such as the Crillon, Four Seasons, Athenee, Ritz, Meurice, Bristol and one or two more, priced at twice as much or more than the Francois 1er.", "Date": "September 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, RU", "Title": "\u201cGenuine hospitality and perfect accommodation\u201d", "Author": "magvictoria", "ReviewID": "UR37488930", "Content": "Just spent 3 nights at this lovely property as a 'rehearsal' before the anniversary trip to Paris in September with my husband.

If you enjoy staying at small, charming hotels then this is for you. It is located on a quiet side street in an excellent area of Paris. It is several blocks to the Champs Eleysee and some great shopping. The Louvre is also within walking distance as are many other areas that are fun to explore. We also found wonderful resturants within walking distance. There is a Metro stop close by and also a stop for the double-decker tour bus which is a good idea for the first visit to Paris.

After a long journey by train and a rather packed first experience of the Paris underground it was very much appreciated. Our room was on the first floor (106), it was not as big as the rooms shown on the website but this did not detract from the elegant decor and furnishings. There was plenty of wardrobe and drawer space for our clothes, and although only staying for 3 nights I don't exactly pack light. The bathroom was really lovely and fully equipped. I didn't use the hairdryer or other toiletries but would definitely come in handy if I'd forgotten anything. We travelled by Eurostar and on arrival at the Gard Du Nord we found it very easy to navigate through the underground system as they have a help desk. I'd heard from another trip advisor reviewer the hotel was not far from the Luis Vuitton store. As you come up from the underground and onto the Champs Elysees you can't miss it. Breakfast at the Francois is such a treat. I love the fact that he hotel is so small, the breakfast restaurant was like eating in a very large dining room. The variety of food was very good, and I'm certain it would satisfy even the fussiest of eaters. Fortunately for me I don't fall into this category so I was spoilt for choice. The coffee was the best I've had at a restaurant and was a great start to my day. Although the underground is a highly recommended method to get about Paris we felt that we'd quite like to amble around and take in all the sights from above ground level and we're so glad we did. The hotel is very central to most of the places we wished to visit. The only downside would be the lack of supermarkets or stores near the hotel. This meant that we were forced to drinking from the minibar which is probably reasonably priced for the area but with the sterling - euro excahnge rate being so low felt a little overpriced. On our last evening in Paris we passed a few restaurants not far from the hotel such as Le Relais de l'Entrecote on Rue Marbeuf (where there was an actual queue forming down the street and Chez Andre (which looked quite busy). Then there was this beautifully quaint restaurant La Fermette Marbeuf again on the same street Rue Marbeuf. As it was a warm evening we chose a table outside. We ate from the 32 euro set menu and has tomato tartin, sirloin steak with bernaise sauce and a selection of mature cheese. To drink we ordered a bottle of Sancerre at 46 euros and large bottle of still water and a bottle of bierre and I believe the total bill came to about 126 euros. They also offered a taster menu of 6courses which cost about 55 euros which looked very good value for money. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. We were given plenty of time between courses and we were not rushed at all. You can even see the Eiffel Tower from some of the seating outside which at 11pm sparkles like a christmas tree, very romantic. Only after we came home did we realise that the inside of this restaurant is what most people recommend you see for the art deco original features. Although I'm a little disappointed I did not get to see the inside of the restaurant I am happy with our overall experience. The waiters were very friendly and very professional and not at all rude which is what I had expected in Paris but I was pleasantly surprised. On our last day we checked out of the hotel at 11am and left our luggage with the hotel to look after and arrived back at 5pm and the receptionist booked a taxi to the station. This a much more pleasant experience than the hustle and bustle of the tube with lots of luggage on our way to the hotel. We were told the taxi would cost 10-12 euros but actually cost 17 euros. The staff at the Francois 1er are very professional and very courteous and we both said we would love to return to Paris again someday and would have no doubts as to where to stay.

Go-today.com said they would also follow up with me and the hotel. Well it has been almost one year and I have not heard from either the group. The wallet was not lost when specific items where removed while I was downstairs (basement area) eating breakfast. Because my entire wallet was not taken I did not realize the missing items until I was at an airport concession stand. Sorry to say that the only people who had access to the room was staff. Also because the hotel is small they can easily track your every move - when you leave and return to the room.

We especially enjoyed the breakfast service, although it unfortunately was not included in the price. The hotel is not cheap by all means, but is worth the money. The entire district around it is rather posh. The breakfast personnel is not French but Cambodian and Vietnamese, which certainly is not a negative thing, they are VERY friendly and accurate. We had a nice experience with staff member Anh, but also with her collegues. Compare this to some other high class places in the city (for instance the Opera district), and you will agree.", "Date": "June 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cDecadence\u201d", "Author": "ScoutManchester", "ReviewID": "UR7646277", "Content": "This hotel was hard to find initially but then when we wandered in the right direction I couldn't believe how close to the Champs Elysses we actually were!
