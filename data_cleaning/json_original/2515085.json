First, many will say the rooms are small. Normally this does not bother me at all. Rooms in Europe are small. You deal with it. Also, these rooms are decorated in a lovely way and very modern and as efficient as they can be. However - I don't like having the toilet in a closet on one side of the room and the shower and sink in a closet on the other side. When going to the bathroom, you have to then open the one door, cross the room, and go wash your hands in the other closet. ICK. The beds were very comfortable. Breakfast was fine but NOT included and priced at an extremely hefty 20 Euros. Do yourself a favor and walk a block and grab coffee and croissants around the corner for 3 Euros. Delicious. What really brought the star rating down was the technical service. First the wifi is completely horrible and totally unreliable. It was always going out - and I see this is a regular problem from other posts. We were there for business - and they cater to business travelers. A hotel like that MUST have reliable wifi and these folks just don't. They were very unsympathetic to the issues. Further, our safe broke twice. It just would not open. They seemed to imply at first that we broke it. Um. No. Then, after the second time I was told that I had to be present for them to open it, and it could only be done by one person in the afternoon, but before 5. So - on my one tour day in Paris, I had to come back to the hotel in the middle of the afternoon so they could open the safe to get my passports etc. Then I was told to not close it/use it again and was offered no alternative on where to store my valuables. Such a shame their service was so lacking there. The folks that work there are nice enough. The area is very convenient (though many many students as directly across from Sorbonne). A very short stroll to the wonderful Luxembourg gardens and an easy distance to the Seine, St. Germaine, and a number of metro stops (bonus- the train from the airport stops a block from the hotel without any station changes). In short - for what it costs, I suppose you are really paying for location, because other than a very comfy bed, and generally nice fixtures - nothing else (like breakfast, security, internet) really seemed to live up to the price.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malta", "Title": "\u201cParis\u201d", "Author": "ozzyMalta", "ReviewID": "UR126590152", "Content": "Excellent service. staff and location.

The days are spent out in the sun, walking around and sight seeing. The size of the room was not a problem for us. The bathrooms were super funky and comfortable and the hotel is clean, the reception is beautifully decorated.

For our first trip to Paris in 2009 we stayed in the Marais at the Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais which was great for the location but our hotel room was super small. In that hotel room our suitcase took up valuable floor space and we were constantly tripping over each other. For the most part hotel rooms are small in Paris, but for our 2nd trip we wanted a bed at least the size we normally sleep in. At the Saint-Michel the room was also small but we got an actual Queen sized bed which was very important to us. Being from NYC the room size was do-able and we could fit one suitcase in the closet and another in a corner so it wasn't so cramped. ***PROS*** -Location. You're close to Luxemborg gardens and the Metro -Large and Comfy Bed. We slept really well here. -Closet Storage -Flat Screen TV -Small Balcony -Nice friendly front desk service ***CONS*** -The tub was a bit high to step in to and the glass panel tricky to open and close. *Tip - I was unaccustomed to the shower/faucet option, you have to pull on the hose to change it. -We did have a problem with the key card for 3 days of our stay, it seemed to be after the maid serviced the room. -Around 1-2pm they restock the fridges and if you're taking a siesta you'll hear slamming doors.

Although we could speak French, we saw them talking with dozens of other guests in English...and always with a smile, a map...a written note to help.

It is located a block from the Pantheon, two blocks from the Luxembourg gardens and a 5 min walk from the university of Paris and all the awesome cafes, bars and restaurantsthat go along with that cool vibe. A 10 to 15 minutes walk and you're standing on the bridge crossing over to the Notre Dame church. The free Wifi allowed us to surf the net between afternoons of sightseeing and evening at cool restuarants and bars...Google maps was our friend!! When we left to come home, we discovered at the airport that we forgot a few teratsures in our room (unique ones that we had bought at the flea market).

The hotel is in a great location around the latin quarter and St. Germain. It itself is on a quiet side street. There are tons of restaurants around and the area by the Seine, about a 10 minute walk, is very lively late into the night. It is up or down, depending on which way you are going, a bit of a hill...let's say compared to the 1st arrondisment/ Louvre area which is very flat. We walked to the Louvre in about 25 minutes.....and I'm seriously not fit. The farthest part of Ile Saint Louis is also probably a 20-25 mins walk. There is a great restaurant we tried out on our last night...just down the street called \"Le Cosi\".

We walked *everywhere* from here- the Eiffel Tower, Rue Mouftard, The Louvre, Champs Elys\u00e9es, etc. The nearby parks are excellent for people watching and picnics. The hotel staff was pleasant and very helpful. They arranged our taxi for the return to the airport. Check-in and out was easy. At some point in the night the hotel entrance is locked. If you\u2019re out very late you\u2019ll need to ring a bell to be let back in. We didn\u2019t realize this and were slightly panicked on Nuit Blanche, an all-night arts and cultural festival, but the manager on duty came to the door in less than a minute. We had a wonderful trip and this Grand Hotel Saint-Michel really worked for us. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. One caveat for light sleepers: The hotel is in a neighborhood with a vibrant student life. And these students occasionally stay out late, drink a lot, and make a racket when the bars close. We live in a city and didn\u2019t find the noise level bothersome and even left the windows open overnight.

It was through an unmarked door just up a few steps off the lobby. While the jr suite was large, it was on the bottom floor and the only window looked out onto a tiny, dark patio.

We have been in Paris a few times before and the choice was narrowed because we needed a triple room and we booked later than usual. The hotel is in an absolutely fantastic location! The foyer and room was spotless....felt I could take my shoes off and feel comfortable as soon as I arrived. No problem with check in-all correct and dealt with in a quiet efficient manner:) Our room was on the first floor overlooking the \"courtyard\" which is really just the back of the hotel with no view at all. It is private and very quiet but could feel a bit oppressive if you were so inclined. The decoration is boutique which may be ok on the brighter upper floors but deep red is not so good when there is not a lot of light. The rooms are VERY small but I honestly think if some things were changed with design it would help. There should be a seperate light in the small foyer area at the wardrobes so that all the room lights dont have to be on when trying to find your clothes. The wardrobe hangers should be side to side and it would make it a lot easier for three adults to find things. The bath needs some sort of rail/bar as the sides are very high on the bath and this could be a safety issue. Bottled water should be provided free in a four star hotel and tea and coffee making facilities should be in the room. The plugs for use above the desk desperately need a mirror as there is nowhere in the room to apply makeup or use hair staighteners that you can see yourself except the bathroom and this is not good when getting ready to get out in the morning. We had to ask for the sheets to be changed on the sofa bed after the third day and this was dealt with promptly. We did not have breakfast in the hotel as we thought 20euros each was too expensive...lots of little cafes in the area to have breakfast,lunch and dinner.

They had a free mini bar policy but that ended July 1st. They offered gratis DVDs for the room, the staff was super friendly and very accommodating.

We both hesitated in booking the hotel, having read other reviews complaining of lost reservations or unavailable rooms, but figured that since they only had the one suite and it was significantly more expensive, they certainly wouldn't lose or overbook that. Upon arrival it took several minutes for the desk clerk to find the reservation, but when she did, her demeanour immediately changed (she became friendly) and she offered to escort us to our room. She walked us passed the elevator and up a couple stairs and through an unmarked door, which led into a TINY corridor (could barely fit one person with their suitcase) which had two doors off of it - another unmarked one and one with a sign designating it for staff. She opened the second unmarked door and ushered us through it. Inside we found a dark \"suite\" boasting no view (just walls), no jacuzzi, and only a shower. When we objected and produced our reservation, clearly stating that we had reserved the suite with the jacuzzi/view (mind you, the only one that was listed!), she said that it was booked until Monday (conveniently) the day we were leaving. When we said the basement room was unacceptable, she offered to show us a Superior Room \"with a view\" and took us up to the fifth floor to a room with barely any room to move around in (standard fair in most of Europe, yes, but unacceptable when you booked a suite), and that so-called view? It was of \"the charming rooftops of Paris\" (her words when she took us to the balcony to show it to us). My fiance and I decided to keep the basement \"suite\" (which we came to call our basement prison), but insisted they give us a better rate for the obvious downgrade. They resisted for a while, then offered 100 Euro off a night (an absolute joke!). When we gathered our things to leave they said that we could talk to the manager on another day, and that they would leave a message for him (why one was unavailable at 2pm on a Thursday is beyond me). We decided to stay the night, and deal with it again in the morning. One of our room keys wasn't working and they promised to have one waiting for us when we left to go out for the night. We emerged after refreshing a bit only to discover a new desk staff, with no idea of our problems, forcing us to wait while they tried to sort out where we were staying so they could make us a new key (as our room didn't even have a number on it!). We were eventually able to work out an agreeable deal with the manager the next day (mostly because we didn't want to deal with the hassle of tracking down a new hotel when we just wanted to enjoy ourselves), but he never offered an apology or any additional compensation. Our room wasn't made up twice, and on one of the days it was, the maid merely folded our wet towels instead of replacing them (causing them to not dry properly and stink). Several of the items we used in the bathroom we never replaced. The shower doors allowed water to leak all over the bathroom, and the hair dryer was latched into the wardrobe, which was right against the door leading out. The \"free mini bar\", which some people mentioned, no longer exists, as of July 4. Also, the room was quite noisy being right next to the main staircase (which, apparently, lots of people use, as the elevator frequently does not work).

I said I wanted one bed and we were given directions to our room which turned out to be a tiny classic room instead! I thought that was quite cheeky considering I had booked a superior room, which costs more. When I asked at reception no offer of moving us was made, which i thought was unfair. At check out I felt I was within my rights to ask for a lower rate since we were not given the room we booked. The lady at reception very grudgingly took 20 euros off our total bill, which was not really enough but it had been such a struggle to get any discount I could not be bothered to argue more with her.

Staff: Very friendly - multi-lingual and will not be annoyed at you for not speaking French. They are very approachable and have good knowledge of surrounding areas and recommended 2 excellent restaurants, whci I'd definitely go back to. Rooms: Usual Paris issue with size - slightly smaller than you'd hope for but very good use of space. Free safe in room. Very modern e.g. automatic \"Do not disturb\" system, which activates when you're in the room. We had a free minibar - soft drinks only - but these were refilled daily. Rooms and towels changed daily. Free toiletries, although nothing to write home about. Views basic but to be honest this matters little as you won't be in there long. Free DVD player so worth bring some of your own to watch if you fancy a night - especially because only 1 of the 30 channels were English speaking and this was BBC World. Oh and free Wireless internet for your phone/laptop! Area: Pretty close to a couple of Metro stations and lots going on nearby. Cafes close by and lots of eateries. We travelled around Paris a lot to see things and most things are easily accessible. Basically the metro serves the city well and you're near to one of the stations so it's fine. The Eurostar station, Gard De Nord, can be taken directly to one of the nearby metro stations, leaving a short walk to the hotel. Area, and most of Paris in fact, is very safe - even at night. Food: Excellent in Paris generally and the breakfast in the hotel is fab. Eat as much as you like buffet - same everyday but a good variety. Free fresh Orange Juice machine, cheeses, breads, croissants, cooked meats etc.... Friendly service. Would definitely go again - one thing I would say is call a couple of days before to gurantee an online booking. We showed up and they had us down to arrive one day later by mistake - so they arranged for us to stay in a nearby hotel, which we paid for, and they gave us a 2-tier upgrade to compensate!

But too many things went wrong during our stay. This is a medium sized newly renovated hotel with a boutique hotel feeling. The location is excellent on a calm sidestreet close to Luxembourg RER train station, walking distance to all attractions in Latin quarters and even Notre dame. Its an area not that full of tourists and not only tourist oriented restaurants so you get a more real Paris feeling. Its also close to the lovely Luxembourg gardens. The reception staff dont seem to be that attentive you pass and enter without any greetings. We had an internet booking for a classic double for 160 Euros per night including taxes and breakfast a very good deal we thought. Breakfast is served in the cellar and was truly amazing when it comes to what was included. They had a machine that made fresh pressed orange juice. You had pastries, different kinds of cheese, yoghurt, scrambled eggs, fruit salad among other things. Coffee was brought to you at your table. Somewhy we were all squeezed to one of the two rooms down there and there was really very little space for every table it spoiled a bit of the experience. Up on arrival at the hotel our room wasnt ready so we were lucky to be upgraded to a superior room on the 6th floor, a bit larger and with great view over the rooftops of Paris. The room was beautiful normalsized in a modern design. Very clean and had a flower theme. The bathroom was a very modern design but extremely unpractical it was totally impossible to use the washing basin without getting water all over the mirror. The bathtub with the shower was the smallest I ve seen. It was impossible to stand straight in the shower and still Im only 179 centimeters. The room was equipped with a LCD television with cable channels, free wireless internet that worked, a safe and coffee making facilities. There is nothing in the room telling you about the facilities of the hotel, there is totally no information about the hotel to be found. We knew beforehand that wifi was free for instance and could ask for it at the reception. Then there is the minibar with soft drinks. Also about this no information. The website tells the soft drinks are free. To be sure we asked the reception and got an asurance that this was the fact. We stayed two nights. After one night the next day when we came back to the room there was suddenly a list in the room were we were told to write down how many bottles we have used each day, a line for a signature and a line to enter the room number. All items softdrinks also had a price on the list. ofcourse we were confused and went down to the reception. He told us that this must be something new that he hadnt seen the list before and that he would ask his colleague next day. We didnt have any more soft drinks not because the paymenyt would be a problem but because we got angry about having got wrong information. Well next day when checking out we again asked about the list and the minibar. She told us that it was for free and that the list was only for them to know how many bottles to refill. I wonder...there was no list the first night we stayed and why did it have prices and a line where to sign. I strongly think that they charge for the minibar if you arent aware of that its supposed to be free. Then came the next problem our bill. Suddenly they wanted to charge 169 Euros instead of 160 per night. Luckily we had a print out of the confirmation this was the way to convince that this was the price agreed. So Im sorry I would have liked to give this place a good review but no its more of a warning to keep your eyes open and check what is included in your deal with the hotel.

They also didn't clean used tea cups, but left them by the bed. The linen wasn't changed, although the bed was made. The rooms aren't very well soundproofed, so as well as hearing noise from the street, you could also hear when your neighbours got back to their rooms, brushed their teeth, walked around, flushed the loo etc etc. Can't comment about breakfasts as we chose to eat ours at local cafes instead.

Neither of us had been to Paris before so we did a fair amount of research before deciding on this hotel, which had more positive reviews than most. Although we wanted a safe, comfortable place to stay, we knew we'd be gone sightseeing each day. We were able to stay at the Grand Hotel Saint-Michel for seven nights, in a classic room with a queen bed, for approximately 1,230 Euros by booking the room on the hotel's website (a better deal than anything posted elsewhere (on Expedia, etc.), particularly since this rate included free WI-FI for the week, mini-bar, and breakfast each day). The breakfast included everything from coffee, fresh squeezed OJ, pastries, fruit, cheese, yogurt, eggs and cereal. The hotel is quite modern--lots of black marble--which isn't exactly my taste, but it was tasteful and clean and the outside of the hotel is attractive. Our classic room was small--as all rooms apparently are in Paris--but it wasn't uncomfortably small. The bed was comfortable and a true queen (instead of two twins pushed together like you often see in Europe). Beyond the breakfast offerings, there is no restaurant or bar in the hotel, but that's not a problem as there are a number of fun cafes within a block in any direction. The hotel is situated on a quiet street but is otherwise located in the heart of the Latin Quarter...with the Sorbonne, young students, and a five minute walk to Notre Dame. We walked almost everywhere we wanted to go that week, including the Eiffel Tower. Perhaps in this regard, the location is better for younger people (or those willing to walk around and explore a bit).

But the room itself. Modern, comfortable and the beds are awesome. Another hard to come by item in Paris. A good bed and pillow. These were great. We lucked out and got the smallest, cheapest room but on the 5th floor with a balcony. Some don't have this. I'd request it on the 5th floor at checkin. We then transfered to the suite. Still small for a suite but an exceptional room at that. Separate living room, bathroom with jacuzzi, separate toilet, and separate bedroom. On the 5th floor with wrap around balcony because it's a corner suite. Wow. If you can upgrade, I'd recommend it. One last thing to mention.

And this was the same every day. Even bread ran out. Not to speak of cheese and cold cuts. The hotel is very close to Sorbonne, all in all a nice area. Despite the recent refurbishment, windows weren't double to prevent sounds from the street. As the area is lively and there a restaurant with a terrace you may hear some noise very late.", "Date": "December 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "marbella", "Title": "\u201cfab boutique hotel, small but perfectly formed rooms!\u201d", "Author": "kathybarlow", "ReviewID": "UR22406264", "Content": "Me and my husband stayed for 3 nights, we had a room on the 5th floor, which was lovely, mirrored wardrobes, comfy bed, shame about the pillows, they were too hard.

NB; I don't think the website is up to date as the hotel is very contemporary in style,no longer having period furnishings and has no lounges or bar as stated on the hotel website. We stayed for 3 nights and booked a superior double room. Rooms small but with contemporary furnishings. Very clean. Try to avoid room 604...which is on top floor. Rather cramped and only has a half size wardrobe due to the alcove, and shock horror, no bathroom mirror other than a shaving mirror which is magnified! This wouldn't be too bad if there was another accessible mirror in the bedroom...but there isn't! Not good for us ladies. We slept for 1 night in the room and then mentioned the probs to reception the next morning...they immediately offered us an alternative room and we moved in within 15 minutes...excellent service! Reception staff extremely helpful with this and also with general info about Paris. Speak good English. We didn't have breakfast, so cannot comment other than it was 15 Euros each. Both rooms we stayed in had flat screen TV, DVD and were very nicely furnished. Bathrooms lovely...great trendy sinks and lovely power showers. Our second room had a seperate toilet, which is always welcome. There is no bar at this hotel and no hotel info booklet in the room, so am unsure whether they have room service. This wasn't a huge prob as there are so many bars, cafes close by. Minibar...but only soft drinks. Hotel within 10 mins walk of RER-Luxembourg station and close to shops etc. Also about 10 mins walk to river! Water bus is a good way to see Paris...about 11 Euros and can jump on and off at various points of interest. Open top bus more expensive. Quiet location...not woken by street noise.Generally speaking was a nice hotel, moderately priced and we had a great stay.", "Date": "September 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rehovot", "Title": "\u201cAbsoulutly wonderfull!!!\u201d", "Author": "Z1985", "ReviewID": "UR15982054", "Content": "Great location, clean and spacious rooms, friendly staff, nicely decorated, great view from the balcony.

I'd been in Paris before, and have always stayed in the 5th. This was the first time for my wife in the city, and wanted to show her the neighborhood I've 'adopted' near the Sorbonne, and you can't get much closer than this. The hotel was fine in nearly all respects. THe location is fantastic, overlooking the Sorbonne and a block from the Pantheon. A block and a half from the Luxembourg RER stop, so convenient from the airport, and 3 blocks to the Cluny Metro. It's a short walk to the Rue de Baci marketplace, a lot of nice small restaurants, Notre Dame, and maybe 10 minutes walk to the Pont Neuf and then the Louvre. The rooms are pretty standard central Paris. Smallish (I've been in smaller roomks in this neighborhood, but expected a little more room in a 3-star), no-frills, clean. The bathroom is quite large and nice by 5th standards, and likely the reason it warrants the extra star. Breakfast was included in our rate and we did it twice (although both times, we got our coffee elsewhere). I'd highly recommend NOT including breakfast (average-at-best food, terrible coffee) and heading around the corner (literally) to one of the cafes on Place de la Sorbonne for a cafe' and baguette. The staff were friendly and helpful and we really were never unsatisfied, just merely 'satisfied'. If you can, try and get a 5th floor room with a balcony. In short, nothing was actually bad, and, outside of the location, nothing was 'great', but I think you can get better value for your money in this area. Spend a little less for a similar location, similar room and a smaller bathroom, or a little more for a larger/newer room. In the end, Paris, and the 5th/6th in particular, have so much to offer, it's hard to fixate on the room very much.", "Date": "November 28, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Grand Hotel Saint-Michel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d194274-Reviews-Grand_Hotel_Saint_Michel-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$235 - $401*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">19 rue Cujas</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">5th Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75005</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515085", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/83/ea/83eab3b09ac2162531ffeb32b00f1ce97large.jpg"}}
