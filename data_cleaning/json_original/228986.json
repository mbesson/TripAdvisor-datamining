Breakfast was good - usual continental style plus scrambled eggs and bacon, cereals, fresh fruit and champagne! Breakfast room overlooked a gorgeous looking swimming pool and garden terrace.

We arrived to the hotel at 8pm and were greeted by an amazing aroma emanating throughout the hotel. The very helpful reception staff checked us in and brought us up to our room. We have a lovely room on the third floor overlooking the front of th hotel. Although the front of the hotel faces onto the main road, this did not pose a problem to us from a noise perspective. Beware, that like most 5 star hotels in Rome, the food is quite expensive. We had something light the first evening in the Bar and you won't see change from Euro100 for two hamburgers, 2 drinks and two coffees. The following morning, we awoke to glorious sunshine (unexpected at that time of year- and the reason why the swimming pool was not filled), and went down to the breakfast buffet. To be honest, the breakfast was sufficient (albeit a limited selection, in comparison to what I would previously have experienced from other 5 star hotels) and the staff are more than willing to have eggs etc.. cooked to your liking. Also huge thumbs up for the blood red orange juice!! The hotel run a free shuttle bus (which seats 7/8) every 50 mins to the Spanish Steps. I would advise that you book this the night before as there are limited places. Do the same for the return journey from the Steps. The driver will also give you a card for the hotel in case you get lost and also a map of Rome. The evening, we had a light dinner of toasted sandwiches and chips (x2), as we had a huge lunch on the Piazza Navona that afternoon. This dinner together with bottled water and a coffee amounted to Euro80. We enjoyed it and the staff were very attentive, but bear in mind the expense. I would highly recommend dining in the Michelin Restaurant downstairs. The staff are very helpful and food is delicious. The tasting menu's start at Euro 110 to Euro 130, or one can go al a carte. All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel. It is located about 10 minutes drive from the Spanish Steps and it is nice to retire to the peace and tranquility, away from the hustle and buslte of the city centre.

To give you a understanding of the service level I would like to mention the following episode: Upon arrival we decided to enjoy the sun in the hotel's beautiful garden. The pool area is open from mid April to end of September so the sun beds had not been \"prepared\". However, the staff quickly arranged towels and pillows for us so that we could relax comfortably. The Hotel Manager, Massimo Mainella, showed up and apologised that the pool area was not \"officially\" open and offered us free drinks and a beautiful lunch as compensation (!!) That's service!!

In the end, we decided to go with this lovely hotel, Aldrovandi Villa Borghese, and the decision is right. I would not say that this hotel is perfect in all senses but it has its merits and these merits overweighed its limitations. If the hotel could address these limitations, I'm sure they would get more excellent reviews. First impression counts The doorman, porter and staff at the reception were excellent. They were very polite and prompt with their service. All of them spoke good English and most happy to assist you when you needed help. Samantha, the front desk staff, who was attending to us during our check in, was very friendly and professional. She briefed us thoroughly on the hotel facilities such as gym and restaurant, the shuttle bus services (told us to book in advance because it's a 7 seater) and the complimentary services that came with our room package. The lobby and room It's rather strange to display three mannequins right in the centre of the hotel lobby. I guess it must be some arrangement the hotel had with some fashion retailer. I would have prefer to have a table and some floral arrangements rather than three mannequins dressed in some summer clothing (and it's winter season when I'm there). The hotel exudes a little old time charm, however, some areas look a bit old. At times, the look and feel is rather inconsistent (some areas have old time charm and the restaurant looks rather modern). We visited another Leading Hotel of the World in central Rome and this other hotel looks better and more contemporary, mainly because it's more consistent throughout the hotel. The room (Room 531), which we were assigned to, looks dated too but it's clean. The front door faces the lift directly but we didn't mind it. The only thing that we didn't like it that much is that the centralised air conditioning was off (winter) and the individual heating system would only be turn on when requested. We would have preferred that each room has its own individual control. During the night, we had to open the window and draw the thick curtain so that the room temperature remained within a comfortable range yet allowing some fresh air to enter the room. The room needs to refurnish a little (it looks dated when compared with some of the pictures other reviewers have posted). I'm not sure whether the hotel is progressively updated the look of all its rooms. However, we are very pleased with the Molton Brown toiletries. They are good and the housekeeping staff replenished them during the turn down service as well. Turn down service The turn down service could be improved further. Yes, the housekeeping staff replenished the toiletries and prepared the bed. However, they did not offer any complimentary bottles of water. We do not require huge bottles of water but two small bottles would be nice (for each side of the bed). It's tough to go hunting for water in the night especially when there's nothing much within the vicinity (you do not want to take from the bar because of the price). Breakfast Service The thing that stood out about the breakfast service is that the staff is extremely attentive and friendly. I must compliment the restaurant manager, Aldo. Aldo saw me taking pictures in the restaurant. He quickly helped me to \"enhance\" my photos such as topping up the ice in the champagne bucket and ensuring the table has all the cutleries. Either he knew that I was going to write a review or that he just wanted my pictures to look nice. Aldo also educated me on the origin of the sparkling wine that they served during breakfast (yes, they serve sparkling wine at breakfast). On a separate note, Aldo heard the clicking of my camera when I left the restaurant. He was very proactive to show me the vintage lift in the hotel. Once again, he told me about the heritage of the lift. Thank you very much, Aldo. I have some great pictures :) There are not that many items at the breakfast service (about 4 different pastries, another 4 types of bread, 2 types of cakes, bacon, eggs, tomatoes, yogurt, juices and a couple more items). Though the selection is limited, it is compensated by the excellent service provided by the restaurant staff. I reckon the way to enjoy the breakfast is to sip some Italian sparkling wine after the main course and be intoxicated by the elegance of the dining room (no pun intended). Gym and pool We did not use the gym or the pool. The pool was closed as it was not heated during winter. As for the gym, it has all the basic equipments. Shuttle Bus service During our stay at the hotel, we had no problems boarding the shuttle bus (even on occasions when we did not book in advance). However, I wouldn't recommend you do that. This is because it can get rather crowded during peak hours such as 545pm and 615pm (on the return leg from Spanish Steps to the hotel). Bear in mind that this is a 7-seater mini bus. But the bus is very well maintained and looks very new. The driver was very friendly too. Michelin Star Chef We did not try the restaurant. But the restaurant does look very contemporary. On one occasion when we visited the restaurant, it was about 70-80% filled. I guess it must be good, otherwise, it would not be patronised by the locals.

the smoked swordfish and salmon were a wonderful way to start the day along with some delicious pastries and fresh fruit salad. also, you can have prosecco with breakfast if you want (which i did since i was on vacation!). there were plenty of other things available as well (bacon, ham, scrambled eggs, yogurt, cake...). the breakfast was included in our room rate and when booking i would suggest you get a package that is breakfast inclusive, otherwise you will be paying quite a bit! the other lovely thing about this hotel is it's location. it is a bit away from the hubbub of downtown rome but still close to the spanish steps and shopping with a very pleasant 15 minute walk through the borghese gardens (which is just what you need after eating breakfast!). there was a hotel car which would take you in if you wanted but it was not available while we were there. they told us to use a taxi and to keep the receipts and they would subtract these amounts off the final bill (i forgot to give these to them when i checked out but it was only a matter of 26 euro for 3 cab rides so it wasn't too expensive!). if you value a bit of peace and quiet in your hotel stay, then you will like the Aldrovandi. also there is a nice pool at the hotel which we used once during our stay and got very prompt service. now for the one glaring negative: the tallish, thin barman with hip glasses and a goatee at the Grill. first of all, let me say that because all the other staff at the Aldrovandi were so good and competent, this one exception doesn't impact my assessment of the quality of the hotel and it's staff, so the barman should be thanking his colleagues at the hotel for compensating for his glaring lack of professionalism. what happened was this: each night after dinner my wife and i would get a nightcap from the bar. the first night i got a single malt from a different bartender. it was expensive (18 euros for an 18 year old Auchton.....) but i got the type of pour i have come to expect when ordering at a high end hotel so no problem. the second night i didn't feel like spending 18 euros so i looked at the relatively low end macallan (12 year old) and i thought i heard him say 12 euros (dodici) but when i got the bill it was 16 euros (seidici) and it was a pretty stingy pour compared to the night before. i left it alone because i couldn't be sure what i heard (dodici and seidici are fairly similar sounding) and i was tired and let the short pour go. the third night i went back for the 18 year old and got this really stingy pour. i showed my wife and she said \"go back and ask for a bit more\" which i did. at this point, the unprofessional bartender took my glass from me, poured the contents out into a measuring glass, and said (in italian) \"see, 4 centilitres\". i explained that i had just paid 18 euros for the measly pour and walked away extremely angry that the bartender had chosen to humiliate me in this fashion. i told the woman at the front desk who was genuinely concerned but i was too angry to do anything more about it at that time. the next day, i talked to giuseppe at the front desk and explained that i was very upset and angry at the rude and unprofessional treatment i had received from the bartender. he agreed that this was not right and we received a written note from massimo mainella apologizing for the bartender's behavior the night before along with a nice bottle of champagne. in the end, the hotel dealt with the problem appropriately and i was satisfied with their response to the issue. my feeling is that this particular bartender should be thanking all his colleagues for being so good at their jobs, so that it compensates almost completely for his incompetence and lack of professionalism. while i will happily return to the Aldrovandi Villa Borghese, i will never order a drink from Grill while he is the barman.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful property, great staff!\u201d", "Author": "ChefG-A2011", "ReviewID": "UR119224583", "Content": "I spent this past weekend at the Aldrovandi and what a beautiful property.

(I did not lead on that I was a chef but sat back and enjoyed the creations that the staff laid before me.) I had not heard of the chef before and had to look up his bio. What I knew was that his cooking was on par with some of the big names in Modernist Cuisine and I appreciated that. I opted for the a la carte menu and ordered the Grouper and Porcini Stuffed Ravioli with smoked pig cheeks -- what a delightful little package of flavor! Who would think of combining those ingredients and make them work? Only a master! My second course was the \"Cinta Senese\u201d suckling pig - an artful combination of the Tuscan pig served with endive and a sliver of lemon jelly; I just wanted more of it! I asked the sommelier to select wines to go with my meal and he came up with two winners - Venetian Sauvignon (Sauvignon Ca Ronesca 2009 and Tuscan Syrah (Achelo Syrah 2008) a magical combination and accompanied the meal exceptionally well.

Most staff (especially restaurant) were extremely helpful and professional. Having booked a specific room not overlooking the road was somewhat disappointed to be allocated one during a three night break away from our three young children.

Consequently we moved room after first night (as did several other guests) which was an inconvenience we could have done without. During the move a soft cuddly toy was left behind between rooms which we realised on our way home - whilst it was not expensive it was for our seven year old daughter and I do not understand why Housekeeping did not find it as it was clearly new in a Harrods bag - on enquiring at the hotel it was apparent from the tone of the staff at that time that they did not really want to go into any great depth to find it. When asked if they would ask the Maid when Housekeeping came back negatively they were defensive. Not what I expect from a Leading Hotel of the World - we have stayed in many far more luxurious accommodations. Rome really needs a Four Seasons to knock service into the 22nd Century.

Our last room had a mirrored wall which made the room seem really spacious and we'd had a separate closet area. This time we didn't have either of those, which was a shame considering it was more expensive. There was a weird damp carpet smell in the corridor that our room was on. We thought on the first day that this was due to it just having been cleaned, but the smell remained throughout our stay and really wasn't very pleasant. The bathroom was absolutely huge, which was nice, and the staff are very friendly. The free shuttle bus to the Spanish Steps is also very good and easy to use. The pool at the hotel is also lovely, particularly when you return from a day of sight-seeing, although there is a lot of shade around the pool from the tall trees surrounding it, so if you're looking for an opportunity to sun-bathe it can be quite difficult. The thing that really put us off the hotel this time though was the exorbitant price of the food and the extras. It really felt as though they were trying to screw every last penny out of you, which we really resented. A 75cl bottle of water by the pool cost \u20ac10.00 whilst a 25cl bottle of Diet Coke was \u20ac9.00. The cheapest lunch in the Grill Room was \u20ac20.00 for salad or pizza and wifi in the room was \u20ac17.00 for 24 hours.

To put our remarks in perspective, we are surprised to read some of the negative reviews. Our experience was positive \u2026 even when things went a bit awry, such as when I locked my laptop in the room safe in such a way that it pressed against the safe door, preventing it from reopening (a hotel maintenance man soon solved the problem). We were visiting Rome to attend our niece\u2019s wedding. It was our first visit to Rome since 1968 (my wife had been there a couple days in the Summer of 1968 as a student, while I spent a month there also as a student, coincidentally at the same time although we did not meet until 5 years later). As over the years our view of \u201croughing it\u201d has become \u201cstaying at a 4 star hotel\u201d, it was important that we select the right hotel. We had several alternatives lined up in case the Aldrovandi Palace did not turn out as advertised. We needn\u2019t have bothered. When we arrived, check-in was friendly and efficient. We were advised that our first choice of room was not available for the first night because the hotel was fully booked. The room we were given was much smaller than expected (but not small by the standards of many European hotels), but it was well appointed, clean and comfortable, and looked out over the rear courtyard where the pool is located [note: due to the season, we did not try the pool which is officially closed in the winter season, but a walk around the pool impressed me that it is a good place to enjoy a hot Roman Summer afternoon, and such nice pools are not especially common for many Rome hotels). To make up for the room, we were invited by the manager to have complementary drinks at the hotel\u2019s charming little lobby bar. Those drinks led to a daily visit to the bar for the remainder of our stay. The bar staff were excellent and in the case of one, very inventive (if Simone Spimpolo is on duty when you visit the bar, ask him to make you a \u201cSofia\u201d; it is very refreshing and delicious, as promised). Drinks are served with small snacks, olives, etc., so it is a very enjoyable experience. The desk staff also recommended an excellent restaurant for us that evening, as the hotel\u2019s premier restaurant (very highly rated, but not inexpensive by anyone\u2019s definition) was closed that night. [Note: There is a small grill room behind the lobby bar that offers a reduced and relatively inexpensive menu for evenings when the premier restaurant is closed, but we wanted to go out that night. As it turned out, we never ate dinner at the hotel, something I now regret.] The next day we were advised that a better room would be available and that if we wished, our things would be transferred to the new room later in the day once it was made up for us. We agreed and went out for the day, informing the staff that when we returned, my wife\u2019s sister and her husband would be joining us for a drink in the room. When we returned that afternoon, our new room was ready and we found a tray of snacks and a chilled bottle of spumante awaiting us \u2026 and the snacks and spumante were again supplied with the complements of the manager. So far, the hotel was doing all it could to make us happy, and if anything we going well beyond the call of duty. The new room also looked over the rear courtyard, but from a different angle, and was easily twice the size of the previous room. Again, the room was very comfortable, well furnished and clean, and the staff had moved everything and placed it in closets and drawers just as it had been in the prior room. Nothing was not where it was expected. The bath was also much larger and well appointed, but I should note the shower was of capsule design that was a new experience for me and I imagine it could be a bit confining for very large-size guests (sumo wrestlers need not apply). As reported by other guests, the breakfasts were very nice as was the breakfast service. My one criticism of the breakfasts would be that the offering did not vary throughout the week, although enough variety was offered each day so that for the week\u2019s stay, it was not a problem. The pastries, fruits, meats, eggs, etc., and most importantly the coffee, were of excellent quality. One day we lingered over breakfast for about 90 minutes, and the staff were happy to keep bringing the cappuccinos. As I thought the hotel had potential to host a small conference for professional associations with which I am associated, I requested a comprehensive tour of the hotel, which was gladly given. I came away thinking my initial assessment of its suitability for that purpose was confirmed. Some guests have criticised the location. We were very happy with it. Unlike many hotels in Rome, the Aldrovandi Palace\u2019s location is very quiet. We enjoyed walking through the Borghese Gardens the few times that we did so (it was Winter, and as the week developed there was rain which limited those excursions \u2026 the week after we departed the rains became more severe and parts Rome suffered significant flooding). I would not walk in the Borghese Gardens at night, nor does the hotel staff recommend so doing. The hotel offers a free shuttle service to and from the Spanish Steps which is very convenient, although it ceases perhaps a bit too early in the evening. Taxis to the hotel, when needed, were easy to come by and not expensive (except for one evening, when it seemed half of Rome was waiting in line). We also found the tram and bus lines that operate past the hotel very convenient; one tram takes you to the Vatican, while one of the buses took an interesting, round-about, route to the Coliseum which allowed us to see aspects of the city likely missed by most tourists. Many embassies are located nearby (I have found in other capital cities that embassy districts tend to have hotels upon which greater service and quality demands are made, and that such districts also tend to have some interesting small restaurant offerings \u2026 and such is the case for the Aldrovandi Palace). However, there are very few shops anywhere near the hotel, so if you are looking to purchase some chocolates or whatever nearby, you are largely out of luck. The week\u2019s stay continued to proceed well and the staff continued to be efficient and friendly. The stay was special in some respects because nothing really stood out. It all went smoothly and without a hitch other than what I have described. I have recommended the hotel to others and will continue to do so. It is likely that we will return to Rome again soon and I believe we may use the Aldrovandi Palace again, especially if we are staying for more than a couple nights as in terms of price, it is a much better value offer than other 5 star hotels in Rome. Even if we are in Rome for only for a night or two and opt to stay in a more centrally located hotel, I believe I might stop by the Aldrovandi Palace to enjoy another Sofia in the lobby bar, if I can time my visit for when Simone is on duty. The Aldrovandi Palace is a great boutique 5 star hotel. Perhaps you might not be so lucky when you stay there, but odds are you will enjoy it as much as we did.", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kalamazoo, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cOpp.........The Hotel smelled like Old peoples Powder\u201d", "Author": "aa6nz", "ReviewID": "UR81216083", "Content": "I made an 1000 euro mistake staying here.

The Hotel is quite lovely inside and the suite we had was spacious, luxurious and everything you would want from a 5 star hotel. Staff were efficient but lacked any kind of friendliness, which you sometime get in upmarket hotels. The hotel is located on the far side of the Borghese gardens from the main centre of Rome i.e. the Corso, Spanish steps etc and is therefore a 25 minute walk through parkland to the crowds and site seeing areas. The walk is quite pleasant through the park but we were recommended not to do it at night. The hotel has a shuttle bus service but we didn't use this so I can't comment on it. The only questionable element to the hotel are the dining facilities. They have 2 options, the first is a Michelin star restaurant called \"Baby\", which looked very nice but only had a set menu when we were there that was 180 Euros per person. The other option was something called the \"Grill\" but it did not in fact grill anything other than sandwiches, in other words it was a fancy snack bar. Cost is a relative thing but 180 Euros per person is too pricey for us, so got a taxi into town but it might be acceptable to others, so make your own mind up.

The lobby bar serves food even after midnight. The hotel shuttle van runs every 30 min. to the Spanish Steps except between 1300-1400 hours. Reserve your return seat to the hotel especially at night since many guests tend to show up late night at the pickup point, and the van can only hold 8 passengers. We walked everywhere right thouth the Villa Borghese even late night and discovered so many beautiful spots overlooking the city. It's a nice 20 min. walk crossing the Villa. We only used taxi to the Vatican (about 12 Euro). We purposely walked to enjoy everything about Rome on foot and enjoyed side-tracking. Bring a good pair of walking shoes to walk on many uneven serface and hills. If you enjoy walking around the town, this hotel is a truly wonderful place to stay.

The Aldrovandi seems to be lagging a bit. I personally hate having to pay for internet access! I always get a significantly upgraded room, and having to hand over an extra 22 euros a day or 20 euros an hour in the business center is just galling. We did find a few small details lacking at the Aldro. Small things, such as the expensive wireless internet being broken, or being unavailable at the pool, or having a selection of just one type of beer at the terace bar, or the cramped \"business center\" with its painfully slow computers where you have to pay 0.35 euros (about 45 US cents) to print one sheet of paper, were niggling little problems, but these are what we remember when we choose a hotel. Quite honestly, if it were not for the pool, we would choose another hotel. Next the goods: The pool, the terrace and it's bar (and especially the waitstaff there) are superb. The calm, invigorating, luxurious and exclusive oasis the pool area provides are essential to our sence of balance when we travel to Rome, that most hurly-burly of cities. The michelin starred restaurant Baby is also superb and the service is worth a second star.

Housekeeping was likewise first rate, as was turn down service. Beautiful comfy robes and towels, the flat screen TV had a good selection of int'l channels. Huge windows in the rooms, with electronic shudders. The AC worked well. The lobby is large, usually not crowded. Not many people seemed to congregate there, however. Little bar area in the back, where there was a good selection of int'l newspapers. Breakfast is outstanding. I think it runs 30 Euros pp or so but ours was included in the room rate. Try for this if you can. The selection was terrific, quality of all items also great. Fresh mozzarella, beautiful prosciutto and hams, great croissants and some of the best baked goods we have had. An ethereal lemon cake, and some excellent blueberry and apricot baked goods. Excellent coffee, fresh juices. Waiter service was professional and prompt. One of our principal reasons for choosing the hotel also was due to the pool. It is in a very well done garden area, almost resorty. Huge and well trimmed trees, large size pool for swimming. Many loungers but, as expected, in August they can get full in the afternoon. Yet, the pool staff were very on the ball in making sure they pulled out additional chairs and/or got you seated as soon as someone left. Concierge service was friendly and on the ball. Good recommendations and always ready with a map and pen to guide you. The porters likewise were friendly and professional, ditto the driver of the hotel shuttle, which is a real plus for the hotel. Of note, the shuttle will also drop you off at Piazza de Popolo or similar, not just at the bottom of the Spanish Steps. The one downside to the property -- and we do think its a real downside -- is the location. Yes, it might be a not too far walk from \"the city\" so to speak but, there is nothing immediately around the hotel. When I asked where we could go to pick up some water and such (the bottle we paid for in the frigo bar was 9 Euros), we were told it was a good ten+ minute walk. The same for a bank for an ATM. In truth, when we travel, we realize location is almost everything. We would have liked to be more in the bustle of Rome. To walk outside and see things, people, cafes, restaurants, etc. That isn't the case at the Aldrovandi. While it may indeed be quieter at the Adlrovandi, we are fine with some city noise. And, for restaurants, sites to see, etc., we were in taxis most everywhere. Those aren't exorbitantly expensive (though not cheap), but its nice to walk places. In short, for a summer visit, with that great pool, it probably can't be beat in Rome and we wouldn't hesitate to return.

I traveled with my family: husband, two teenagers (15 & 18) to Rome (yes, in the crazy heat of August...) and booked the Aldrovandi through Leading Hotels of the World. LHW (and Merritt) were extremely helpful with my booking, changing my reservation when a summer special was offered at European LHW. She is fantastic. We chose the Aldrovandi over other five-star Rome hotels because of the pool. Our family could only travel during this time slot & we thought after hot Rome sightseeing, it would be wondrful take a cool dip in a pool. And the pool really served us well. The location is not ideal, above the Borgese Gardens, but we were very aware of this, realizing that the pool took presidence over a city-center location. The hotel offers a shuttle. Their shuttle system leaves a lot to be desired. Management couldn't always fit our family into the bus, or the shuttle wasn't back for an hour..those sorts of issues. We found taxis in Rome to be reasonable, safe, and clean. We did walk down into Rome center, which was not far, about 15 minutes, and all downhill, so it is certainly managable---just dusty and hot. The hotel lobby is in the old classic style: marble floors, high ceilings, velvet and chintz chairs and couches. A small sweet bar is tucked off in a corner and the front desk is rich wood. Bellman and concierges are professional. The breakfast buffet, which was included in our rate, was gorgeous & was served in a dining room overlooking the gardens on the grounds. Service at breakfast was excellent. We did not eat at the gourmet restaurant, \"Baby,\" but did have drinks at the pool and snacks at the beautiful outdoor patio. We booked two suites with garden views. The teens first rooms were smoke filled and the hotel quickly moved them to a different suite on the same floor. My husband and I were at the end of the hall on the 3rd floor. To get to our rooms, we took a very quaint tiny elevator. Our rooms were in the corner of the hotel, with no real view. The suite was quite large, with a sitting room, bedroom ,and bath. But here is where I begin to wonder about what makes a five star hotel.... One can write \"eclectic furnishing and antiques\" and I find it old, drab, and dark. The air-conditioning did cool the rooms, but the A/C were units attached to the base of the window sills . They were quite elementary considering the hotel's claim of five-stars, and in contrast to other five-star hotels in Rome. The bathroom was silly. \"Old World?\" . The bath had one small sink, a large tub/shower. The shower concept was truly old-style, reminding me of hotels from the '80's, where you really couldn't fit a (thin) body into the plastic cone-contraption and inevitably water sprayed everywhere. My husband, at 6'3\" thought he was backpacking again and not paying for a luxery hotel experience. But the worst issues with the hotel were: 1. We returned home the 2nd day to no water and no water pressure. We telephoned down to the front deck. They told us that there had been a power outage on the street and that we would eventually have water pressure soon. It did come on--in a trickle--about 25 minutes later. But why had there been no notice/note put under our doors? There was absolutely no communication between guests and the front desk about what was going on, nor were we ever updated. Eventually we did have water. Cold water. And that's the way it was for the next three days. NO HOT WATER. Nope. Management kept sending someone up to take a look. Finally the young hotel concierge told us that \"you are at the end of the pipe line so you must just run your water for about 20 minutes and you will get hot water.\" Huh? Having recently renovated two historic buildings, my husband and I knew that the hot water issue was a chronic one, with a watertank system that is old and insufficient for this five star title.. \"Old World\" just doesn't cut it when one is being charged over $1,250 a night. And I know I could have asked, to move our rooms...but I'm not so sure that moving would have had a positive result. Our kids, who had been moved to a new suite down the hall, had the same problem. Being in a service industry, I was also surprised that management didn't at the very least send us a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience. No apologies. No gestures of goodwill. Again, no professional courtesy extended. Aldrovandi Palace has many niceties, but management needs to address its infrastructure: water, a/c/ , bathroom, and the training of staff to communicate and placate guests when problems arise . I do not consider Aldrovandi Palace in the same catagory as all other Leading Hotels of the World or five-star accomodations. And I am sorry to have to write this.

The free shuttle bus makes up for this disadvantage, although 7.25 pm as the latest return to the hotel from the Piazza di Spagna is too early. The Villa Borghese and the beautiful Galleria Borghese with magnificent sculptures of Bernini ( let the concierge of the hotel make the necessary reservations for a visit to the Galleria) are nearby and the park is lovely for a walk on a sunny day. So the hotel is perfect for a visit to Rome, without having to undergo the never ending hustle and bustle of a metropole.

The house keeping staff did a perfect job, with turndown service in the evening. The view from the room was less. We looked out on the parking lot of the hotel, and, granted, on the very beautiful embassy of the Netherlands. One tip for people who like authentic Italian cuisine: ristorante Pararoma, 5 minutes walk from the hotel. Excellent cuisine, very reasonably priced. Certainly not a tourist trap. For those who like japanese food (even when in Italy) like us, Hamasei, not far from the Piazza di Spagna. Some points of criticism: we stayed for 7 nights in the hotel. The buffet breakfast was fine, but was the same every morning with no variation. Not everything from the warm buffet, was warm. The pastry that was on the buffet, also was the same kind every day. The cost of internet (25 EUR. for 24 hours) was too expensive. Hotels like this should offer this complimentary to their guests. And finally, when we made the reservation, we informed the hotel that it was a special trip since we celebrated our 25th marriage anniversary and we became both 50 years of age.

Aware of the late hour and some of the comments I had read on Tripadvisor I enquired as to the possibility of a swim, and was delighted to hear that the pool is open 24 hrs, the only caveat being, there are no pool attendants after 7pm and so you need to take your own towel down with you if you wish to swim after that. Whilst the kids cooled off in the pool, which they had completely to themselves, we sat in the wonderful shaded gardens sipping chilled Pinot Grigio and nibbling on the complimentary pizzatinis. The surroundings really are exquisite, and exactly the situation in which you would like to find yourself, after a tiring day. The only problem we encountered during our stay was the difficulty in tearing ourselves away from this little Oasis to get down to the serious business of sightseeing! The complimentary shuttle bus was excellent, leaving every hour and dropping off at the foot of the Spanish Steps. They also pick up from here at 25 past the hour. I also thoroughly recommend strolling through the Villa Borghese gardens which is a lovely way to start the day and takes no longer than twenty minutes if you don't stop along the way. The concierge were absolutely first class throughout our stay,really helpful with information and restaurant reservations.

Since our last visit there has been significant refurbishment and the results are fantastic! The reason for choosing the hotel again was to have a pool to relax by when we weren't sight-seeing. The pool area is lovely and the hotel provide enormous yellow towels and extremely comfortable loungers to use while sunbathing. The only downside of the pool area is that there are so many trees surrounding it you end up dodging the shade all day if you want to get a tan. There is a lot of sun though - you just need to move every now and then to stay in it. Our room was huge and had a big mirrored wall on one side which made it feel even bigger. The bathroom was enormous and we both loved it - there was a huge separate walk-in shower with a rain shower head and the whole bathroom was spotless. The hotel is expensive for \"extras\" - for example a 75cl bottle of water by the pool costs 6 Euros, and buffet breakfast is 33 Euros per person, but it is a 5 star hotel and the prices are no more extortionate than other similar hotels. We booked through Expedia and got a really good rate and then we minimised what we spent while we were there. It's easy enough to get water and breakfast outside of the hotel if you want to keep your costs down. Overall I would definitely recommend the hotel. It isn't cheap but it has an air of luxury about it and you get really well looked after.

Plus points; Rooms beautifully crisp clean and very well appointed - beautiful pool set in lush gardens - courtesy schuttle bus to and from Spanish steps - very courteous and friendly front desk staff / and porters - (especially Danilelle who drives the schuttle bus). Nothing was a problem - everything we asked for was attended to immediately - we only had one meal in the hotel during our stay so we can't comment comprehensively, but the food we did have there was excellently prepared and presented. Overall - everything one would expect from a 5 star hotel in Rome. Negatives: Food is very expensive - we couldn't comment on the quality of the breakfast, but at \u20ac33 for a buffet breakfast, it would want to be something really special for me to part with that kind of money - so with the exception of one pool-side meal, we ate out. Two excellent local eateries are located at Piatza Ungaria - 10 mins walking distance - turn left out the hotel and follow the tram lines. One is the Cafe Ungaria which served breakfast and a wide range of good value snacks - and not forgetting their wonderful selection of Ice Creams. The other eaterie is the Ristorante / Taverna Rossini - which served a wonderful selection of meat and fish dishes for lunch and dinner - we didn't have one, but the steaks looked to die for! The hotel is located a little too far away from the main attractions compared with other hotels, but we felt the free schuttle and the quietness of the setting/location off-set this negative. Via Veneto is about a 12 - 15 min walk through the Viall Borghese gardens, as is the Piatza Popolo. Another very good value eaterie on the Via Veneto is the Grand Cafe Roma - at the bottom on the right hand side just before the Piatza Berberini - serves a very good 4 course breakfast for \u20ac12 - so eating breakfast out saved us \u20ac40 each time! Overall I would rate this hotel very highly - yes it is expensive but thats the cost of staying in a five star hotel in Rome. Before we booked the Aldrovandi, we had already made a reservation for another 3/4 star in a more central loaction costing \u20ac300 less for our 7 night visit. While this other hotel was rated very highly, many of the reviews mentioned traffic noise (due to it's central location) - and also that it was small and cramped - both common problems with many of the other centrally located hotels I gather. As we were celebrating a special occasion and as we were going to be staying for seven nights, we felt that comfort was very important to us and and on that basis, we decided to cancel our inital booking of the other centrally located hotel, and instead, spend the extra for guaranteed 5 star luxury at the Aldrovandi Palace - (about \u20ac45 a night extra) and I have to say, that is exactly what we got - definitely money well spent!", "Date": "June 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cExpensive but great\u201d", "Author": "J&CYorks", "ReviewID": "UR15469833", "Content": "Largely as other positive reviews.

My overall impression was that the hotel is over-staffed and under-managed, but we did have a super time!

Although next to the Borghese Gardens and near the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Villa Guila, it is located in a residential area and far enough away from the heart of Rome to make it difficult to find decent food. Given such a captive audience, every drink and morsel was terribly expensive and merely adequate - $16 euros for coffee and croissants, $6.00 for a bowl of rice krispies. We did not brave the restaurant \"Baby\" (yes, an awful name) on the ground floor because it simply is not for children. But food isn't all that's amiss. The hotel itself is in dire need of renovation. It seems mired in some 1950 version of Soviet luxury -while the lobby is vast, it is unappealing; the breakfast dining area is dated and tacky; and the hallways and common areas need to enter the 20th century. While our room was acceptable, we did have a problem initially when we were given a \"freshly cleaned\" room that smelled like poison. After having read some responses from TripAdvisor travellers, I was prepared to meet to rude employees - but the situation was handled rather well and we were moved to a different room. The shuttle bus is helpful, but you need to make reservations in advance (particularly if you are going to town during dinner time). And you should know that the shuttle stops at 7:25, so you're on your own with a taxi after that. The pool is a wonderful extravagance in Rome and is even better if you do not have a sight-seeing itinerary. There are only a few things to be aware of: 1. There are stupid foot showers blocking the paths and everyone falls in at one time or another; 2. The pool is not open at night (after 6:00) and 3. there is a rather strange older woman who appears to dominate the scene ( I got the impression that she might even have formerly owned the place as everyone deferred to her and she had constant service) and who constantly reprimands children, jumpers and splashers.

Not a major burden given the good restaurants near by, but hotel restaurants should be open for guests by definition. Also breakfast is ridiculously expensive.

We booked on the recommendation of our local TravelCounsellor and as always were not disappointed. Based on some of the reviews I wonder how other people go about booking their holidays. We always think about where to go, what to do bear in mind what is important to us. Tip 1: Do not book this hotel if you want to be in the centre of the city. It is in a fantastic location opposite a beautiful park and is a haven in an incredibly busy city. You will have to get a shuttle/taxi into town but it is well worth it for the benefits. We did walk out from town one evening and it was fine, we enjoying walking and there is PLENTY of sights to take in on the way home (but take a map) Tip 2: This is a quality hotel with beautiful interiors and classic furnishings. Do not book this hotel if you will not appreciate this. If you want a hotel with cheap and 'jazzy' patterns and every room a carbon copy of the next go elsewhere. We loved everything about this hotel: 1 The staff were 'grown up', very polite and helpful - we did encounter a few problems with our booking but the staff sorted this out quickly. 2 We booked on a bed & breakfast basis and was the best value way to book. The breakfast was amazing, it was a beautiful room and you could even choose which view you preferred. The food/coffee was really good and we ate at various times and the room was never busy. It really was the perfect start to a busy day sightseeing. 3 The room itself was a standard room overlooking the front of the hotel - we had no issues with noise. The furnishings were lovely - we had no problem with the antique mirrors!! 4 The bar in the hotel - although small and not exactly buzzing was very nice and relaxing - nice bar snacks. The outside pool area is also beautiful and lovely for a morning walk. 5 Staff at the front door were very friendly and always got taxis and informed us how long they would be.

(Nor would I have done the Waldorf in New York for my honeymoon come to think of it! - that was excellent also, as it happens!) Firstly we decided to pre book a limo on-line from and to the airport for 55 euros each way. Yes its cheaper on the train, however,it is far less hassle in heat of 30\u00b0 plus and it isnt much more than the cost of a taxi. I can't fault our room. No there wasn't a coffee/tea making facility in the room but not many hotels outside the UK offer this. It may well have been refurbished in comparison to some of the traveller's photos posted but it was spotlessly clean, not huge no but if you want to live in your hotel room book a junior suite or larger. Air con was fine but might not be available year round. Decent sized bathroom. The room faced the park and yes you had to squint around the trees and the view was mainly of the road below. If you want a pool and garden facing room then, one must request it. There was a button next to the window for the electrically operated metal window shutters. Once fully down they acted as blackout blinds and masked road noise. My companion slept soundly for the entire 3 nights whilst I didn't but then I do live in the middle of the countryside with no neighbours or road noise. For reference our room was 407. The grounds and pool area were a welcome retreat after a long day sightseeing. The late evenings there were tranquil and with a glass of wine or champagne in hand we discussed our days or, simply marvelled at the wonderful surroundings. The staff were nothing but professional and hardworking. Yes breakfast was expensive at over 30 euros per person. We found that you sit outside a caf\u00e9 for an hour with the locals with a cappuccino and pastries in hand on the Via Veneto for approx 12 euros for the both of us! The shuttle bus goes hourly from 10am until 7pm to the Spanish steps but if you ask in advance they will stop en route to drop you off! This they did several mornings, as we booked the hop on hop off city tour of rome with the concierge at the hotel desk for 19 euros each. We joined it at the main bus point across from the Savoy Hotel on the via Ludovisi just off the Via Veneto. It is a fantastic and cost effective way of seeing all the major sites of rome and runs until approx 7pm at night. The shuttle leaves the far end of the square at the bottom of the Spanish steps at 25 past the hour to return. Taxi fares are only 8-10 euros, this is very reasonable compared to some cities in Europe. We didnt have the opportunity to dine in the hotel restaurant as we were too busy sight seeing. We discovered a fantastic ice cream parlour at the bottom of the Spanish steps and made it our own :) Our last night was spent dining at the rooftop restaurant at the Hotel Hasler at the top of the Spanish steps. Expensive yes but well worth it and, if you book ask for a table next to the panoramic window as the views of Rome are to die for! Would we stay again? Absolutely. Rome is a shopper's paradise, a sightseers dream and simply too big not to want to return and see a great deal more. Next time however I think we shall go when the temperatures are not so high as you quickly wilt in the heat. Not many hotels in Rome have a pool to cool off in so, if you want the best of both worlds this is the hotel for you.

The lobby area was large and appointed with luxurious furnishings. But the room just didn't meet expectations. Rome is an expensive city for hotels, especially during vacation season. I attended a small conference at the hotel and, with some reticence, paid the 330 Euros (plus tax) for a basic room, rather than finding another hotel nearby. While the room was quite small, the furnishings were nice: great linens, big window, well-stocked (but expensive) mini-bar. The bathroom was relatively large and well lit. On the downside, the furniture was well-worn (not in a good way), the carpet was not clean (toenail clippings next to the desk), and everything in the hotel was vastly overpriced. Little things were bothersome: a faceplate on an electrical outlet fell off when I touched it. The rack of hooks on the back of the bathroom door was broken and hanging limply. Internet in the room was broken the first night. (Although the second night wasn't much better -- they asked for 25 euros for 24 hours! Fortunately there was free WiFi in the hotel lobby.) I was lucky to be in Rome during warm weather and the air conditioning worked great. However, it's clear that the system is designed to blow cold air only in summer and warm air only in winter. If you experience unseasonal weather during your stay, the AC probably won't help. (The windows did open however.) While the bathroom was large, the shower was old-school Italy: a narrow tub with a hand-held shower unit and a hook in the middle of the wall at eye level to hold the shower unit. End result: an awkward, cramped unsatisfying shower experience. The bathroom amenities were adequate, and ventilation was good. As for services, the hotel knows how to deliver the 4 star experience. Wonderful garden and pool (although I didn't swim), friendly staff, and efficient communications. My colleague was upgraded to a suite with butler service. First morning, he had a knock on the door asking if they could iron his shirt. Yes, of course, but it came back with a 15 euro bill. (Oddly, when I asked the concierge for a shoe shine, that was free.) Business-wise, the hotel clearly doesn't cater to the business traveler. There were no electrical outlets near the desk, and the internet access was outrageously expensive. There is a business center: a small room with two PCs and a printer, fortunately all free. The neighborhood was quiet and obviously rich. I could see embassies and grand residences just across the street from the hotel. Closest restaurants and shops were a 10 minute walk. Taxi into town was about 10 Euros, though, so not a big deal. I didn't try the shuttle service.

We had three rooms (one for my parents, one for us and one for our two sons). Before we arrived the hotel was quite helpful, arranging babysitters on a couple of evenings so we could book 'grown up' dinners outside the hotel. The staff were all very friendly and courteous. The rooms, although not very large, were quite modern with comfortable beds, nice bathrooms and sufficient wardrobe space. The cable TV didn't have any channels for kids, but another reviewer had already identified that shortcoming so we were ready for it - we took a DVD player and that was fine. After all, we weren't planning to spend much time in the room anyway! We didn't try the 'Baby' restaurant because the menu looked rather fussy and quite expensive (the degustation menu was EUR 95 I think). However we did eat in the less-formal grill-room once. It was a bit disappointing (in fact, room service, which we used for the kids a couple of times, was better!) It was also quite expensive -- EUR 350 for six people, for a very mediocre meal with just one bottle of wine. Breakfast was extensive -- and expensive, at EUR 33 per person. My recommendation would be not to bother with the hotel's dining facilities at all, unless you can get a B&B rate. There is a shuttle minibus down the Piazza di Spagna every hour (at xx:00 there, and xx:25 back), but we were six people and found on more than one occasion that there wasn't space. However the hotel will allow you to call and book a special pickup, which we did once. There is also a reasonably efficient taxi booking service run by the concierge (although note if you are more than four people getting a large vehicle is nigh on impossible, we frequently had to take two cabs). The gardens are lovely -- try to get a room on that side of the hotel, as the rooms over the road-side can be a little noisy according to my parents (who were woken by the early-morning trams a couple of times). Unfortunately the outdoor pool doesn't open until 01-May so we weren't able to enjoy that facility. Nor did we try the gym. Overall, a nice hotel and a haven outside town (a few minutes walk from Villa Borghese) after a busy day sightseeing. Now for the 'but'.... 1. We did have some problems with cabs -- they wouldn't take bookings so you had to call/go down and ask for one 5-10mins before you needed it, and then take your chances. 2. The aircon in our room was not 100% reliable -- and the first time we complained, they were pretty adamant that it was us and not the machine that was at fault.

Having read the varied reviews I was a little apprehensive about this hotel. However, I really can't praise the hotel enough. The hotel staff were extremely professional, helpful and friendly. Our room had a garden view and was immaculate. It was compact but beautiful. It was cleaned twice daily and the maids couldn't have been more helpful. The breakfasts were 33 euros each, which was rather expensive, but on a positive note, there was plenty of variety and the food was of a very good quality. Having eaten out during the day, we found that it was cheaper to eat in the hotel in the morning rather than find somewhere during the day. The shuttle bus runs from the hotel on the hour to the Spanish Steps and returns at 25 past the hour. The hotel are more than happy to call a taxi for you. Please be aware......We paid 70 Euros from the airport and was 'ripped off' by the taxi driver. The cost from the airport should have been 40 Euros, but we didn't know at the time. Also be aware of the beggars and romanian women with babies who have perfected the art of pick pocketing. We had our purse stolen, but luckily got it back. Keep hold of your bags and make it difficult for them. A bum bag would possibly have been better to carry our belongings in.

We have visited many hotels in Italy and always look forward to going back to the Aldrovandi. It has two great attractions for us, namely location and staff. The location supplies peace and quiet and enough space for gardens and a pool, yet handy for the centre. It might not appeal to anybody wanting to be plunged into the thick of thing in the Rome Centre, but for us it is marvelous to return to a warm welcome after a day of intensive shopping and sight-seeing. The hourly shuttle is a boon, & a taxi from the centre should be about 10 Euros (or a little more at night). The walk via the Borghese Gardens is only 20 mins or so, but I wouldn't recommend it after dark . The gardens/zoo also make for a lovely early morning walk if (like me) you are up an hour before your partner has finshed her \"toilettte\". Contrary to some earlier comments, we have always found the staff to be welcoming, cheery and very helpful.

If you\u2019re looking for the modern, ultra-hip five star experience there are plenty of options in this great city, the Exedra, the Aleph etc. But if you want the five-star European luxury hotel done like it used to be then you could so a lot worse than the Aldrovandi. When I\u2019ve stayed in Rome before it\u2019s always been in the city centre but one of the best things about this lovely hotel is the fact that you\u2019re about 4-5 minutes taxi ride from the tumult of Roma, on the outskirts of the Villa Borghese. The hotel runs an hourly shuttle to the Piazza del Spagna. But we either took taxis or enjoyed the 20 minute walk across the park- either to the Spanish Steps or to the Piazza del Popolo, enjoying the incredible views over the city before descending into the piazza. I can honestly say we couldn\u2019t fault the service at the Aldrovandi- from check in to check out. The concierges were unfailingly helpful, suggesting and reserving restaurants. Some of the other comments here about rude or difficult staff could not be more different from our experience. Our room was on the small size but incredibly comfortable (with a park view) and spotlessly clean. Breakfast was good- maybe a little lacking in variety but fine. I can\u2019t comment on the restaurant- Baby- as we ate out every night. One example of the Aldrovandi\u2019s service sums up why we enjoyed it so much.

Yes the rooms may be small, however with all of Rome a 5 minute taxi ride away, you'll spend little time in it. The best venue for dinner in Rome is the rooftop restaurant at the Hashe view of Rome and the amazing cuisine.

I would advise getting a taxi from the airport if there is more than one as its much quicker and works out roughly the same as a train and taxi. We took three Angel Tours. The First to the Vatican was fantastic we had an Irish guide called Anne Marie she was brillant. The second tour was the Heart of Rome, it was good but unfortunately the Pantheon was closed unexpectately so the tour was cut short.

The suite which we were allocated ( Room 607 ) was beautiful. It had a spacious sitting room, separate luggage storage area, a marbled, well appointed and well lit bathroom ( combined bath and monsoon shower cubicle ) and a good sized bedroom with loads of hanging and storage space as well as a king size double bed. The decor, furniture, lighting and bedding were all of a very high standard. We especially liked the pale blue striped silk (?) lined walls throughout and the dramatic pink three piece suite in the sitting room. The traditional tasteful furniture and lamps made it a restful sanctuary to return to after each wonderful but exhausting sightseeing day in Rome. The staff in the hotel were all friendly and professional especially the doorman, Danielle, who went out of his way to be helpful. Getting into the city from this location beside the restful Borghese gardens was easy, an eight minute ride to the Spanish Steps in the hourly hotel courtesy bus or, as Danielle showed us, a fifteen minute, one euro tram ride from right outside the hotel to the Vatican. Because the courtesy bus doesn't operate after 7.30pm we used metered taxis to get back to the hotel on three or four occasions and the fare, including tip, was always under ten euros. The reviewer on these pages who claims they paid up to twenty five euros must have been taken for a ride in more ways than one! We didn't eat in the hotel, apart from the ample quantities of complimentary fresh fruit provided in our room that is, as we wanted to sample a variety of restaurants and cafes in Rome. On that subject may I recommend that you give both 'Piperno' and 'Babington's Tea Rooms', (both recommended in the 'Dorling Kindersley' travel guide), a miss. We found them to be very overpriced at over \u00a370 for a two course lunch for two with one small glass of house wine at 'Piperno' and \u00a335 for one soup and toast, one coffee, one tea and a jam and cream scone at 'Babingtons.' The food was nice in both places, but not that nice! For really good value traditional Italian food try 'Ninos' in Via Borgognona near the Spanish Steps. This was suggested by A.A. Gill in The Sunday Times a couple of weeks ago so we thought we would try it and we were glad we did. We were a bit concerned about going to this hotel because of some of the negative reviews on this site but everything turned out fine. We had intended going to a more central hotel but were unable to get a reservation. On reflection I am glad that we didn't as Rome is so noisy and we may not have enjoyed the peaceful nights sleep which we got here. I'm sorry that we didn't get around to trying the 'baby' restaurant but feel that in terms of the facilities we actually used 'The Aldrovandi Palace' deserves its five star grading.", "Date": "October 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spain", "Title": "\u201cThird stage of our Honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "CAGP", "ReviewID": "UR5974676", "Content": "We arrived on the 14th of October and the driver took us to a very nice green area (Borghese Gardens) where the Aldrovandi is located (ten minutes walk from the Hotel to Piazza del Popolo and shuttle service all day long to Piazza Spagna). The Hotel is a Palazzo, we stayed in a very nice suite with views of the pool and gardens, classic style mixed with plasma and bang & olufsen music equipment (nice blend). Casual pool restaurant was good and the Baby (1 Michelin star) was beyond expectations in service, food quality, presentation and wines (10/10). During dinner we were introduce to the Chef Alfonso Iaccarino who also has a 3 Michelin Star Restaurant called Don Alfonso in Sant Agata (Amalfi). Concierge and reception were very reliable and can't tell you anything about the breakfast due that we just had cappuccinos in the room every morning. I recommend to go at least once to Mario in Via delle Vite, great food, service and ambience (lunch or dinner).

There wasn't however enough space around the pool when the hotel was full and fighting for sunbeds actually in the sun became a daily battle. The pool was nice and clean but freezing.

The mitchellin starred resturant was nice but very overpriced in my opinion and the 'grill' restuarant grilled nothing! All you could eat there was salads, even in the evening. The menues were very poor throughout the hotel and choice was very limited. Breakfast was disappointing again and again very overpriced at 20E a head.
