We booked this hotel through Hotel Club, it is listed as a 3 star hotel.Basically it's a 1 star at best!!! Its 30 minutes hike from the train station, through not the pleasantest of areas, the streets have condom machines on them which makes you wonder.When we arrived there the guy on the desk told us nothing about when or where breakfast was or what time check out was. When we found our room - bearing in mind we had made them aware we were on honeymoon, half the door frame was missing, in the room the walls were all cracked and had holes in them where clearly a TV bracket had been but had probably fallen off! The windows did not close properly, the floor wasn't clean. The bedding was clean as were the towels but very tired and both had holes in.Because the windows didn't close properly it was noisy and the 'view' not very nice at all.It is again 30 minutes walk to any half decent restaurants.The following morning, we were told where breakfast was, at first glance this seemed ok, but on checking and tasting we were very dissappointed. Firstly, the coffee tasted burnt, the bread was dry and tasteless, the orange juice - well I think it was orange juice - you didn't wan't to try, it didn't look very nice! The hot chocolate was terrible. The ham and cheese were very thin processed slices on a plate under a light so were warm and sweaty! The cereal selection consited of basically tesco's value cornflakes!All in all we were very very dissapointed, we really didn't like the place at all, fortunately we were only staying for one night so we coped but we strongly recomended you avoid this place as you would Bernard Matthews Turkeys!Had we not already paid we would have turned around and walked another 40 minutes or so (with our 20 kilo rucksacks) and found somewhere else. We will post some photo's when we get home but we're still on honeymoon but wanted to get a post up about this place as soon as possible.", "Date": "Feb 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR978424207", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "mini_monkey"}, {"Content": "Please Stay away!!!!

Secondly its in a very shoddy neighborhood, upon arrival we got to see a guy on a moped taken out in a head on collission, great place to park! Third the staff were terrible, the one in particular refused to speak english on the phone when we wanted to clarify the address but had no problems speaking english when we were in front of him. Its terribly difficult to find, dirty, small, there is no reason to stay here, in fact after viewing it and having my wife in tears and my sisters family refusing to stay I had to suck it up and spring for the local holiday inn to the tune of 300 euro for the night.

We booked into the Hotel Airone through the Ryanair website for three nights. We stayed for one. We would not consider ourselves particularly fussy, but pleasant staff and basic cleanliness are not too much to ask for, and there is NO WAY that this should be considered to be a three star hotel. Firstly, it is not as described in terms of distance from the centre of Florence, which we swiftly realised when in the taxi from the main station. We did not think it was a very good sign in the first place when the driver had not heard of the hotel and we had to show him it on the map. The taxi cost around \u62e28 and the hotel is quite far out from the centre. The neighbourhood did not feel particularly safe, to be honest. When we went into the hotel, we were barked at by the receptionist to close the door for the air conditioning, despite the fact that we were in the process of lifting our cases in at the time! Once inside the tiny reception area, she then proceeded to ignore us for the next few minutes while she finished looking at whatever it was on the computer that she was looking at. When she eventually turned round, it was to say that rooms are not ready until two o'clock (it was just after one o'clock) and that we would have to go away and come back again. No offer of anywhere TO wait, but she did indicate that we could leave the cases downstairs in the 'TV room'. At this point, without even having seen the room, we had decided that we did not want to stay there! This was confirmed when we went down in the lift to the basement tv room and breakfast area, which was tiny, poky and stuffy. We then decided to walk into town to find another hotel. This took 45 minutes in the boiling heat. We would have taken our cases there and then but did not want to risk having nowhere to stay for the night and this would have made our trek even more unbearable. As it turned out, we had to stay at Airone for one night, but booked into a central hotel for the remaining two. When we went back to Airone to get into our room, there was a lovely older Italian man on reception (the owner?) and he couldn't have been nicer, unlike the first woman! He didn't speak any English, but gave us a map of the city and pointed out highlights, giving us the numbers of buses to take etc. The room was like a prison cell - the shutters on the windows had to stay shut to give any privacy at all due to how overlooked the hotel is, there were no curtains, a grubby bedspread and camp-bed type thing and a foul, stale smell. The floor tiles resembled those rusty coloured ones that you find in old public toilets. There was a huge ceiling fan that wobbled dangerously as it spun round and looked like it was about to fall off at any minute. The mini bar was a joke - it had a couple of cans of orange and you could not open it properly due to where it was squeezed into. The bathroom, on the other hand, was clean and looked like it had been modernised fairly recently. Pity we could not say the same for the room itself. In the morning, having decided that we would at least have one breakfast for our money, we went down to the breakfast area at 9am (breakfast is between 7.30 and 9.30). There was no-one to be seen, no food apart from two stale pieces of bread in a bread bin, and a couple of tables with breakfast remains that had not been cleared away. No-one came near us, the stale air was unbearable, and so we just left. The 'garden area' that is mentioned on both the Ryanair and the hotel websites consisted of a couple of concrete slabs and a few plants! Overall, I would certainly NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. Even if on a budget, you can find affordable accommodation in the centre of Florence and save yourelf the taxi fares. The city itself is absolutely beautiful and the rest of the service we received whilst there was excellent. We will definitely go back to Florence, but will be giving the Hotel Airone a wide berth!", "Date": "Jul 10, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR913526058", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Not as Described Stayed here for 3 nights.

Sure, the staff was very helpful, but that did not cover the minus of this hotel.Overall, I think Florence is overrated. The city is really dirty that we don't see the 'Renaissance' about this city at all. My advise if you visit Florence, stay in the suburb.
