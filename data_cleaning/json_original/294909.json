Here are the negatives, and there are too many for a hotel that calls itself a four star hotel. The walls and windows are paper thin. You can hear everything and I mean everything from outside, from the room beside you and the room above you. The restaurant is mediocre and so very overpriced. There are very few amenities; just soap and shampoo in the bathroom; no gym or spa, breakfast is 14EUR and was not included in the rate. There are so many other hotels in the same area, it is worth looking elsewhere. I recommend the Maywood Hotel in Istanbul.

I booked two sea view rooms and was so pleased by cleanliness and the view of the Marmara Sea that I had from both rooms. The Old City of Sultanahmet is a short, easy 5 minute walk from the back door of the hotel, with restaurants, cafes and small shops lining the streets on the way up.

I had no issues with anything at this hotel. Food in the onsite restaurant is expensive, but a short walk out the front of the hotel to the left or to the right will bring you to restaurants that are open from about 8 am until about 1030 pm, after 1030 pm, the Armada hotel serves light sandwiches until midnight, but for the best food in the city, it is definitely worth the walk up to Sultanahmet.

Breakfast is super with wonderful view to the Marmara sea. You can see dolphines swimming in the sea in the morning, while having your breakfast. Rooms are newly refurbished , clean, no carpet on floor. LCD TV monitor. Generally i would rate it good +. You may order one of 3 types pillows free of charge to your room, they are feather, ortopdeic and hard ortopedic. In rooms and in the hotel wi-fi free of charge. I recommend this hotel to everyone and if i come to Istanbul ever again, i will choose this hotel. Apart from center Taksim square, this place is very quite.

My husband and I think that this was the very best choice for luxury without the large price ticket. I was delighted to find this hotel was newly refurbished in a very modern way, which was a pleasing juxtaposition with the rather higgledy-piggledy jumble sale of buildings around it - Istanbul is a strange mixture of the beautiful cheek by jowl with the derelict! But the real reasons that I wanted to write about this hotel are as follows: as we stepped into the lobby the front of house staff addressed us by name (!) and had all our room keys ready to go. Our bags were moved everywhere for us. I am not lazy; I am not accustomed to being waited on hand a foot, but it was very welcome late on a Saturday night after a day of travelling. Look at the photos to see that the Standard rooms are excellent and are worth turning down a sea view for. Think about it- you will only admire the view briefly twice a day at most if you have come to see Istanbul. The room service was extremely good value for money. One evening we decided to stay in and watch BBC on the TV with well cooked Turkish fare rather than run the gauntlet of being hassled by over-eager waiters outside every restaurant. Only a short walk from the Blue Mosque and the Haghia Sofia I really think we pulled a blinder with this hotel - I spoke with other European travellers, who were in small and poky hotels in streets where some of the buildings are collapsing. Just a point to note, tea and coffee nis not available in the room; however, the minibar is very good! This hotel is used by the Turks for their business and leisure trips and I can see why.

Chose the hotel because I needed a place I could do some work while traveling, and for that purpose, it served me very well. Wifi was included in the price, and was hotel-wide, not only in public areas...so many hotels advertise wifi in the rooms, but it doesn't work, or barely works. Hotel was simple and clean. Not luxurious, but for a traveler on a mid-range budget it will do nicely. Staff was courteous, and though I didn't demand much from them, they courteously and thoughtfully responded to my questions . Location was good but slightly frustrating; very close to Sultanahmet, but down on the sea, meaning you have to walk out and around, and then up the hill to some of the tourist sights. I had a room with a sea view, but actually wish I had paid less for a room overlooking the back alley, because the road between the hotel and the sea is rather busy. It is not particularly convenient to trams; it's a good hotel for someone who likes to get around by taxi, but when I return to Istanbul, I'll probably choose a place closer to a tram stop so I can more easily navigate the city on foot.", "Date": "January 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amman, Jordan", "Title": "\u201cpriceless View , Nice Staff\u201d", "Author": "roadrunner82", "ReviewID": "UR51124643", "Content": "Stayed in Kalyon for 5 nights in a business trip in April 09 the location is simply magnificent with a wonderful view of the sea , few minutes away from topkaby palace , I liked the urban newly furnished lobby, the rooms were very cleaned and tidy although I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very lucky and I ended in aground Flore room .

The hotel is located in the Sultanahmet area where many of the tourist attractions are but from the hotel there are some quite steep roads leading up to the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia. There are several bars, restaurants, and minimarkets close to the hotel so you will not have to go without food and drink. If you take the regular train, there is a stop, Cankurtaran, almost next to the hotel. But altogether the location is so-so, especially when considering there is a big road just outside the hotel and traffic in Istanbul is noisy. The hotel seems to be very business-oriented so the staff is somewhat \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cold\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but very polite. Checking in was quite fast and I got a room on the 2nd floor facing the street. The room was fairly big but somewhat worn and the bathroom was not in that great shape with some visible stains and a crack in the sink. But altogether an OK experience EXCEPT for the bed which was hard as a rock! And I am not just saying hard \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I mean HARD and my colleague in another room was of the exact same opinion. Internet was for free and there was some problems logging on but a trip to the reception provided me with a user name and password. There were some problems with internet, especially late in the evening when I just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t manage to use the internet. Breakfast was OK though annoying things as staff not letting you pour your own coffee and so did occur. The hotel was a fair value but compared to the other 4-star hotel I stayed at (Marmara Sisli), the Marmara was far better.

The overall standard is good, but it can improve. My room stank of stale cigarette smoke which did not go away during the 3 nights I slept there. The AC was too powerful for the small room (temp. regulation not available) and I could not open the windows because of the mosquitos. No green tea available for breakfast. Extremely depressing pictures in the atrium. Just to name a few dislikes. As for the rest, the personnel was very friendly and whoever was not friendly showed to be competent.

They even gave a leaflet for suggested taxi fares to the major sites and seemed concerned that people were getting ripped off by taxi drivers. The room was cleaned well each day although we didn't always get a refill of creamer or tea bags - strangely packets of salt appeared!
