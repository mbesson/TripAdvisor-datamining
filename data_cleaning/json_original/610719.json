The price was 458 EUR or $640 CDN. Check-in at 2PM. The lobby was nice and there's a nice sitting area on the landing of the first floor. The first room we were shown, on floor two (which is the third floor) was tiny. The bathroom took up one third of the room. A small corner window with shutters looked out onto the street. There was no air conditioning to speak of. The room next door was being repaired (workers/cleaners present) and the toilet was sitting in the hallway. My linen closet is larger than the elevator. After inquiring about other available rooms and being advised that most were the same size and that is what the air conditioning is like in Rome, we were shown a room on the fifth floor, off the rooftop patio. The bedroom was about the same size as the other room and the washroom was smaller - shower only. However this room had an independent (remote controlled) air conditioner! SOLD. The elevator only went to the floor below so we had to carry our luggage up one floor. The bed was a bit hard, but we were so tired after cramming in the sites all day that it was fine. The mini-bar prices were reasonable. Breakfast was OK. Hard boiled eggs, bread, croissants, cheese slices (like kraft) and those foil wrapped cheese triangles (the name escapes me), butter, jam and coffee or tea. Skip the juice - it's like Tang. No ice to be found in this hotel. I was advised they don't use ice - they serve cold drinks. The desk staff seemed a bit aloof but warmed up and were efficient. The rooftop patio was OK. Some tables and plastic chairs (no bar service or anything like that). Internet is available but a bit pricey (and no printer available). We used an Internet Spot about a block away (booked our Vatican Tour on-line). (something like $1 EUR for 20 min. and .20 per page to print. The area around the hotel was great. Many neat restaurants a few blocks away. We really enjoyed the Ristorante Il Condor (best pizza) on Via Daniele Manin. Also the Aquila Nera on Via Principe Amedeo. The location was close to the Termini which was convenient (the Metro is in there). We had arranged a private transfer through our agent. The company was www.limoinrome.com , it was worth every penny. Charming drivers/tour guides (Luca and Claudio). We did not know that they did tours. If we had more time and $$$ we would definitely have used their services. Nothing special about this hotel (it was clean). First time in Rome so I don't have anything to compare it to.

We were not really greeted when we arrived, just given our key and told to mind the construction (there was construction on the 4th floor to the ceilings). We were on the 5th floor which has no elevator so we took the elevator up to 4 and walked up a flight. Our room was clean (besides the flies in the bathroom shower) and had a cute little balcony. As with many European hotels, the walls are paper-thin so you can hear everything in the hallway. We, unfortunately, had a rowdy American (I am American too but this guy took it to a whole new level) so we didn't sleep very well. Overall, I would say the experience was just OK. Compared to the other hotels we stayed at in other cities, this was just decent. If it hadn't been an option in the package, I would have stayed elsewhere.

Breakfast was relaxed, plenty of fruits, and continental style foods. Whilst we were there they were refitting the doorways between the breakfast room and bar, however work on this started a good while after the breakfast sessions and was cleaned up so you would never know they'd ever been working there. The only thing I would urge the hotel in improving is making more of the roof top garden which is a lovely space. It has tables and chairs to sit and enjoy the sights and setting sun of Romes roof tops but it would have been nice to have a small bar or area to have refreshments whichi think would go down a treat with guest using the hotel.

The rooms were bright, clean and spacious and had a great view of the 'Teatro dell Opera' on one side and 'Sante Maria Maggiore' on the other. Breakfast was plentiful with croisants, fruit, yoghurt, pastries, rolls, conserves etc and there was always sufficient, being regularly topped up. There are several lounge areas with lovely furnishings and a roof gartden giving fantastic views over Rome. Plenty of Restaurants nearby and only a 20 minute walk to the Colosseum. I would have no hesitaion in recommending this Hotel, Rome is obviously a very expensive place to stay so if you want 4 star then expect to pay an awful lot for it but I couldn't have been happier with my choice.

We were moved to a much nicer room on the top floor. Not the cleanest, but a real improvement. Sadly, the door/window didn't work properly so we had to struggle to lock it every time we left the room. The staff knew about this, they told us it wasn't working when we moved in. They didn't repair it during the week we were in the room. The kids from all over the hotel partied on the outside rooftop deck ( right outside our malfunctioning window/door) until all hours. The only night we got a good night's sleep was our second to last night. And that was the night the earthquake in neighbouring l'Aquilla woke us at 4:30 a.m.. The frightening swaying got the adrenaline flowing! No advice from the desk on what to do here during an earthquake. Nobody answered the phone. Or even commented the next day. Directions would have been appreciated. The earthquake certainly wasn't their fault but lack of information to guests was unforgivable, especially given the size of the quake. The heat was on high and the airconditioning was off. Despite the heat wave. We have stayed in other Italian Hotels but this was the worst by far. It needs a good cleaning and service staff training.

No clean tables, no glasses, cups, food. I know a continental breakfast can be limited but that took the biscuit. Then we were in the middle off a domestic row which came from the kitchen and last at least half an hour, we really though we were in the middle of a remake of Faulty Towers.

The rooms are okay in an expected small European room style, with incredibly dim lighting (even if you turn on every light in the bedroom) and small bathroom layout. The first room they put us in started leaking from the bathroom ceiling, exactly where your head would be if you sat on the toilet. When we told them about it, they said they already knew about the problem, shrugged their shoulders, and handed us extra towels to mop it up. They did transfer us to another room the next day, which had a slightly better bathroom layout (and actual windows!), but with two single beds pushed together. Also, I wonder why they don't have a soap dish in the shower stall, but there's one right next to the bidet. In any case, the room was still quiet, the beds were comfortably firm, and it was what we say \"a bed to get back to\" after a long day. The breakfast was beyond bizarre and tasteless. The bread was stale, the eggs undercooked, and orange juice tasting like overconcentrated acid. The only thing that was good was the chocolate croissants and other pastries, and we're pretty sure those were purchased from a bakery. Everything is gone by 9:30, so if you hope to eat their disastrous breakfast, don't start late. Also, all 3 concierge clerks were minimally courteous and friendly, but seemingly detached from being helpful. When we asked about a good, homestyle, non-touristy affordable restaurant, the evening concierge directed us to two places that were very much for tourists and for pizzas or high-end fusion menus. Completely off from what we had hoped for. The only positive thing I can honestly say is that they were good enough to move us (even though they shouldn't have given the first room to anyone if they already knew about the problem) and that the proximity to the Stazione Termini was not in a seedy part of town and good enough for us to catch the airport train out with ease.", "Date": "July 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cNeeds improvement, but good budget hotel in Rome.\u201d", "Author": "lagirl29", "ReviewID": "UR31026065", "Content": "We had a nice 1-night stay in May at the Impero Hotel.

We stayed for 2 nights, As you first enter the hotel it is very grand and beatiful and the staircase makes it look a lot more than a 3*. the first night the room was small but clean - padded fabric panels gave the room a romantic feel. The bathroom was long and narrow and smelt strongly of damp but again, not a huge problem seen as you don't spend alot of time in your room. Shower was adequate and if you sat on the toilet sideways fine! The second night whilst getting changed the electricity went off - after an hour of trying to get back on in our room we had to switch to a different room, the second room was much larger with a much nicer bathroom which looked as though it had recently been done out.

The room allocated on the second floor had a shower and a dark space in a corner with a clothes rail which was our \"wardrobe\". The concierge was both unfriendly and unhelpful and said that no rooms had a bath. However, after producing my booking confirmation we were given a room on the 4th floor. The bath was a shortened tub; you could not stretch out your legs (I am 5'2\"). The heated towel rail was held in place with tissues stuffed into the wall at its base; the curtain rail around the bath was coming away from the wall so that the rail bowed in the middle and a large tile had come away from the bath surround which was wedged in sideways. The breakfast was basic and unwrapped in the kitchen i.e. the equivalent of Kraft Cheese slices were put on a plate; the orange/tropical juice available from a machine were two delicate shades of \"radioactive\" yellow and orange and even the milk took on a flavour of its own. Arriving down for breakfast at 8.45 on the third (and thankfully last) day of our stay, the bread rolls ran out completely and no alternative was offered. The lift available carries 3 people standing sideways and if luggage is involved then a queue forms. Most guests appeared to use the stairs. The walls throughout the upper part of the hotel (we had friends staying on another floor) appeared to be crumbling in parts and showed damp. The only good points of the hotel were its location; the photographs shown on various websites of the small lounge on the first floor and the inner staircase which the majority of guests used to avoid the lift. Returning to the hotel in the evening a second concierge was eating his evening meal and could not even respond to us as he was too busy chewing and chatting to a friend who was propping up the reception desk.

However, I have to warn that the shuttle service is not very friendly...nor is the ride very smooth. If you plan on taking the Trenitalia train to visit other cities from Rome, Hotel Impero makes it very convenient since it's located w/in a short walk from the Termini station, where you can catch the Trenitalia trains. Also, if and when you have to go home late at night, you can always find a bus that will go to the Termini, so you don't have to rush to come back by the Metro or waste money taking a cab. But be VERY VERY careful taking the bus...esp. when it's late at night and the bus is crowded. My friend got pickpocketed on our last night in Rome on our way home to the Termini stop.

I don't know if all the triples are like that, but if that is a concern for you, you should ask and confirm before making reservations. The bathroom in our room had a very small shower stall. The water temperature was not very constant. But the bathroom overall was clean. The hotel offers a free map of Rome at the front desk; just ask for one. We found the map to be extremely helpful; wish we didn't buy our own map going to Rome. If you are thinking about buying a map for Rome, I would forget about it since you can get one for free at the hotel. Long-distance phone service was very expensive. My friend had to make a phone call to cancel his credit card. He said his call only lasted 5 minutes or so. We ended up being charged 2 euros. You can get cheaper rates for phone and internet at a nearby internet/phone station. Breakfast at the hotel was bad.

The room itself was small and compact but was very clean and had everything that you would require for a short stay in Rome (the shower, however,was extremely small). The reception staff, breakfast staff and cleaners were extremely friendly and happy to help! The breakfast was just as we expected for Italy and if you love pastries you will have no problems. Reception let us leave our bags for the afternoon after we checkedout for no charge and even rang us a taxi for the airport. I would recommend the Irish Bar on Via National which is around the corner, out of all the traditional Italian places that we ate at in the surrounding area this was the best! Also much better value for money! My only negative comments would be about the bar in the reception area which is barely used, therefore,the staff do not know what the drinks are or indeed how much they are. I would suggest buying your own from any of the local shops and putting it in your minibar! Overall i would highly recommend the Hotel Impero and would certainly stay there again!", "Date": "November 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cA great choice!\u201d", "Author": "SeattleWeekender", "ReviewID": "UR4049574", "Content": "Hotel Impero is a GREAT value. We moved there after checking out of a horrible dive near Termini called Hotel Giorgina - Avoid Giorgina at all costs! Our room at Impero was only 20 Euros more a night and WOW- what a difference! Impero is near Termini and easy walking distance to all the sights, but located on a slightly less crazy street than many Termini hotels. Our room and adjoining bathroom were just lovely. Charming, spotlessly clean, sparkling bathroom, quiet. The shower stall was very small, but we just laughed about this and got on with it- A small price to pay for such a great place! When you book, be sure to ask for a room on the third floor or higher for the best stay. We were in room 420 and highly recommend it. The only poor rooms in this hotel are the ones on the first floor that haven't been updated yet. The breakfast was fine by Italy hotel standards and the staff was pleasant and helpful. We would stay at Impero again in a heartbeat.", "Date": "October 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristow, VA", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel in convenient location\u201d", "Author": "LisaMM99", "ReviewID": "UR4029208", "Content": "Hotel worked out perfectly for our 3 days in Rome, it is in a greatlocation to either walk or take other transportation to the entire city.

DO NOT go to the Washington Bar opposite - they charged us 8 euros for a measure of local brandy and 4 euros for a can of coke. Even the italians eating there complained about the food.

Very clean, nice folks, centrally located right next door to the Opera and a block from one of the major museums. Two blocks from the train station. Ice is available from the staff. So-so breakfast. Refrigerator and safe in each room. Pretty quiet for a Rome hotel. One very nice restaurant right around the corner, directly opposite the Opera house. Try the squid in balsamic vinegar! A nice trattoria is located out the front door, two doors to the left. A really good restaurant (says it is Chinese and has great, low cost Italian and Chinese dishes) is next to the trattoria. Dinner of three courses and a bottle of wine was 30 Euros. Two gripes: sewage smell comes from the shower drain (we covered the drain with the plastic wastebasket when not in use), and the toilet seat was broken and very uncomfortable. Management didn't have a replacement seat.

The staff are friendly, the hotel is clean and the air con was a god send. It's well placed, just a 5 min walk from the main train and bus station and ten mins from the main centre. Its close enough without being in the heart of the hussle and bussle. The breakfast was the usual self service buffet of bread rolls, cheese, butter, jams, some cereals, fruit juice, tea & coffee nothing to blow the mind. I didn't experiance the hotel meals so I can not comment on them. Although I could nit pick about a few minor point I will not as it will take away merit from a great budget hotel. What I will say to anyone going to Rome, watch out for the young local children near the bus & train station. They look sweet enough but as we found out some are pick pockets.

In a busy area of the city, but location is quite quiet. Breakfast continental but most adequate. My family (myself, wife, teenager) stayed here for a week in August. Good value, good price.
