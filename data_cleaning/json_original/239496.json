Plus points: 1) 50 yards from Pantheon and within 15-20 min walking distance of most major sites. 2) Very inexpensive hotel considering the fantastic location. Don't expect the moon for 95 Euros a day. 3) Plenty of eating places of all kinds (two of the best gellaterias in the area) 4) Quiet, given the location 5) Friendly and helpful staff who speak several languages, including English. Front desk open round the clock (one man insisted that we have breakfast when we checked out at 7 a.m. on the 13th even though breakfast officially starts at 8. He also made us fresh Italian-style coffee since we were coffee connoisseurs). Breakfast laid out includes rolls, croissants, biscotti, butter, jam, meusli, cornflakes, milk, coffee, tea, hot water, orange juice. 6) Recently renovated (???) since toilet fixtures were new in our room. 7) Clean sheets and towels (towels were replaced on second day), soap and shampoo packs daily. Minus: 1) Our room barely had a view -- of a crummy wall opposite. But then, we came there only to sleep at night. Double bed, one extra bed/couch/diwan whatever. So, can sleep three. 2) Shower temperature erratic. One minute it's icy cold, the next minute, it's scalding. Front desk man promptly leaped up to fix it when we pointed it out. Problem continued for the next three days. Sigh. 3) Mimosa accepts only cash even though the website gives the impression that you can pay by credit card. Computer printout on front desk claimed -- and I use this word deliberately -- that they were having problems with the connections and that credit card is only for making reservations. But I'm told by a resident of Rome that a cash-only policy is quite common in pensiones, probably as a tax evasion ploy. Confirm before you make a booking if you cannot pay cash. Cash machines are plentiful near the hotel. Watch out for 19.5 percent commission at cash exchanges though (listed in small print at the bottom of the exchange rates). You might have a problem finding the hotel. It's a dark green door, with a 1ft x 6in metal plate sign just above the listing of all the building's occupants. When facing the Pantheon, walk to the back on the right side of Pantheon, on via della rotunda. go about 25 yards after the pantheon building complex ends.Then turn right on via di santa chiara. It's the second or third green door on the left. The sign is almost invisible. Almost opposite it is a small coffee and sandwich shop that opens usually around 6 a.m. and serves coffee from 7ish.

We had many rooms and all of the showers had orange mildew in them. I went to the local grocery store and bought shower cleaner and cleaned the common shower in the single bathroom myself because it was disgusting. The rooms themselves were very nice, although some people in my group complained that the restaurant below on the street was loud some nights. The floors had not been swept in a while as there were dust bunnies all over. I didn't look too hard for fear of what I would find. Thank goodness I remembered to bring flip flops with me! The wifi was so-so. Often it didn't work at all and you could only access it from the reception area. Breakfast was simple, pre-packaged croissants and bread. Nothing fancy but enough to fill you up. We had to ask for fresh fruit and after a few days they had some oranges and apples. I'd suggest going to the local supermarket on Corso I think it was and buy some fruit for yourself (pick your fruit, remember the bin number, put it on the scale and click the bin number for it to print out a price label). Location was wicked, we spend every night in front of the Pantheon and we walked everywhere (including the Colosseum and Forum), so I would suggest finding somewhere in the same area. I don't know how much the hotel costs or others cost in the area. We had it all included in our course fees. Not based on price, I would say its fine if you don't mind moldy, mildew-filled showers. And I mean FILLED. You could draw pictures on the wall in mildew if you want. Bring shower shoes. My room was room 9. Same hall as the shared bathroom, but had a nice sink in the room and a nice wardrobe. Desk staff were quiet. Didn't speak much. I didn't try to stike up conversation. PS. They list a deal saying 45Euros for 2 people to the airport. Any taxi from the Pantheon area is E40. Don't have the hotel book. We saw another guest get ripped off by the hotel who took his E45 and then the taxi wanted his E40. Just walk to the Pantheon the day before you want to leave at about that time.

I don't think I would have stayed more than a night or two anyway because the \"family\" room we had was too basic, three beds pushed together on one side and one cot on the other side was too dorm/hostel in which case one would look for a hostel, which I suspect would be cheaper than $155 Euro.

First, the location is great (almost next to the Pantheon). It's really nice to stay in the heart of Rome. There is so much nightlife in all the piazzas, it's great to be part of that and be able to take a short walk back to the hotel. BUT, as other reviews have said, it was a bit dirty. Our bathroom smelled like urine and we had to keep the door closed. They didn't clean the shower the whole time we were there. And we never got a fresh towel. I asked for a fresh towel and they said they were out. When we first arrived, there was loud jackhammering from a renovation beside or above our room. It was unbearable. We wanted to rest from our long flight and couldn't. It was also very loud from the street noise. They said they didn't have another room for our first night, but after the first night, they got us another room on an inside couryard and away from the jackhammering - much better. Most of the young people at the desk were very nice. EXCEPT, on our last night, a desk attendent we hadn't seen before asked us to pay for the room (cash only). We counted out the money, and then he asked for more money for himself! I thought this was very strange. I had never seen this person before, he hadn't done anything for us, and it felt like extortion. The breakfast wasn't very good. Hard rolls with packages of butter and jelly. There was an orange colored liquid, but it wasn't orange juice. Maybe Tang or something. Also, I've stayed at other \"inexpensive\" hotels and had much better experiences. So my comments are not just someone who has 5 star tastes on a 1 star budget. It's such a special experience to spend time in Rome - FIND A NICER PLACE TO STAY. The following is for your information (not a complaint): It is on the 2nd floor (what Americans call the 3rd floor) and there is no elevator. It is not well marked from the street and it is hard to find in the tangle of Roman streets. The hotel did arrange for a cab to pick us up at the airport and bring us right to the hotel, so we didn't have to try to find it.

We found the hotel's website and the website totally misrepresents what you are getting. Our room was dirty. Specifically, the floor looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years, the shower curtain was filthy, the grout in the shower was moldy, and the walls were dirty. When we checked in, we were tired and jet-lagged, and we didn't know where else we could get a room for the next 4 nights, so the management really had us over a barrel. We checked in, went to the room, and went back to the front desk to complain. The person at the desk was sullen and most unhelpful. He told us that if we chose to move, we'd have to pay for that night and the next night. We just decided to suck it up and stay. Also, we had booked a room with a king-sized bed, and we got two twins. Not too great for a 2nd honeymoon, which is what this trip was! The sullen guy at the front desk said that on Monday the maid would make up the beds into a king. Well, this actually happened on Tuesday, and all that was done was to use the same sheets with the two beds pushed together----which we had already done. To top this all off, the room next door to ours was under serious construction. We had plaster dust in our beds from the workers banging on the walls next door, plus we couldn't use our room to take a siesta in the afternoons because the workers were making such a racket next door. We complained about this, too, and we were told that the workers were not to be working from 1:00 to 4:00. That was a huge lie. The workers were there froom 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., and there was a terrific lot of dust in the hallway, too. Didn't help our allergies. We had to ask for clean towels, too. When we checked out, my husband insisted that the desk clerk call the manager to tell him that we had no intention of paying the full price for our room because we hadn't been able to use it for 1/3 of the day (while the workmen were working), and that we would pay only 2/3 of the amount. The manager said OK. Also, the website had said that the hotel took major credit cards, and when we checked in, the sullen desk clerk told us \"cash only.\" (The good news is that we STILL had a great time in Rome, and went on to have a fabulous time in Venice and Florence----and stayed at two very nice hotels there, the Hotel Al Gamboa in Venice and the Hotel Bellosguardo in Florence.)", "Date": "June 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cUpgraded hostel.\u201d", "Author": "j2dtravels", "ReviewID": "UR31762151", "Content": "Expectations better met if one thinks of Hotel Mimosa as upgraded hostel.

Frommer's (our resource) was very clear this was not a fancy hotel so my husband and I knew what to expect and were fine with it. I probably wouldn't refer this hotel to friends UNLESS I knew location was very important to them and they were going to be OK with a very basic, no-frills hotel. We had one of the smaller rooms without a bathroom. There was not a lot of extra space in the room but it had what we needed and it was nice to have a sink and faucet in the room since we were showering down the hall. We had two twin beds rather than a double but we soon came to learn this was a trend in Italy. The staff was pleasant enough and gave us a map of the city. Despite Frommer's promise of a hearty American breakfast we received the traditional pastries, bread and coffee. Again, very basic but for the price we couldn't complain. The bathroom was pretty clean and with two of them we rarely had difficulty having access to one of them. Be prepared, the showers are very small (again, another Italian trend as we discovered). At 4' 11\" I had no problems but my husband is a bigger guy so it wasn't quite as comfortable. AC worked well which was good as there was a little noise sometimes late at night and early on some mornings. Not bad with the windows shut unless you are a pretty light sleeper. The area seemed clean, safe and there were an assortment of bars (coffee), bakeries, restaurants, wine shops and other stores. Plus, it was fun to sit out in front of the Pantheon for breakfast or a late snack. Overall, it worked well for us. We were hardly there (there is so much to see and do in Rome) and considering the exchange rate was $1.60 for 1 Euro we wanted to spend our money as wisely as possible.", "Date": "June 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami", "Title": "\u201cDISGUSTING!!!!\u201d", "Author": "acga", "ReviewID": "UR16422618", "Content": "The rooms were dirty, the air was smelly, the sheets were soiled, the bathroom was flooded and filthy.

The beds were like camp beds, two singles pushed together, but they were of different heights! The pillows were old and misshapen. My bed had a blanket but my husband's only had a duvet. The room had very eccentric wiring and I didn't risk using my hairdryer. There was only one bedside light - difficult if both of you wanted to read in bed. The bathroom was minimalist.
