My wife and I initially thought that value wise it gives more bang for the buck. But just after one night we already had a scary and disappointing experience. First when we were getting ready for work, the closet door which should at least be 50 lbs heavy, fell on our 3 yo son while he was closing the thing after getting a pair of socks.

Our son recovered and looks fine to me.

The front desk staff try their best to greet you by name, and they go the extra mile with attentiveness, number of services, high quality of service, and communicating to you that it's their pleasure to do whatever they can for you. 2. Parking is complimentary, abundant, and in a wrap-around lot with safety features like bright lights and other businesses nearby. 3. The breakfast has rice! There are also plenty of dry items, cold foods, and hot selections. 4. Sport court with racket and basketball rentals, fitness center with dumb bells, and pool. 5. The new general manager is genuinely personable, and he does whatever he can to make things right if expectations are not met by guests. He and his wonderful staff from the front desk, to the grounds keepers, to the breakfast and sundowner reception staff, and to the housekeepers have won us over to not even think about staying anywhere else the next time that we go to San Diego. 6. We had a 2 bedroom suite - which feels like a well furnished apartment rather than a hotel room. One bedroom had a king bed with its own full bath. The other bedroom had a queen bed with its own full bath and a desk area. The two bedrooms were connected by a spacious living room with dining table, four chairs, couch, comfy chair, and a kitchen with two stove-top burners, utensils, bowls, pots, pans, full sized-refrigerator/freezer, etcetera. 7. Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday night they make a pile of food for all of the guests - no reservations required. Drinks too. All complimentary. Variety of things - while we were there it was greek food one evening, mexican food another, and burgers and hotdogs the other evening. Good flavors and variety. They don't call it a dinner, but we took it as that and thoroughly enjoyed it. 8.

One downside was that we left the \"do not disturb\" magnet up for our morning run, and apparently there is no room cleaning after the morning rounds.

Yes, it is a decent hotel. Yes, it is convenient from the freeway. But that is where the charm ended for me. We arrived at 10:30 p.m. to a nearly empty parking lot (on a Friday night during the Miramar Airshow weekend) and parked right up front. We checked in right away, utilized the 24/7 shop to buy some munchies after driving all evening and then tried to hit the sack. The shop is a really great thing that a lot of these \"suite\" type of hotels now do, but it is costly. Well, the first thing we noticed is that the people hanging out right below our second story window (outside on the patio) were talking. They were not loud or rude or obnoxious, but with the windows closed and the T.V. and A/C on, we could still hear them. Thin windows? No, it was probably because our room with two double beds was not made for TWO beds of any kind! One was shoved up against the window so my husband had to crawl over me to get in or out, thus we were quite close to the window! No one's fault, really. But it was sort of annoying. And when they mean double, they mean double - these beds are SMALL! However, they were comfortable. If you have a family of four, plan on using the sofa bed. If we had it to do over, we probably would have gotten the king with the sofa bed for the three of us. Two doubles are too crowded and too small! Second thing we noticed was that the A/C was extremely LOUD and made a horrible vibrating, humming sound when it was on. The kind of sound that makes your insides squirm. We just turned it off and finally fell asleep. But you can hear your neighbor's A/C when it kicks on! Sadly, our weekend event started at 7:30 a.m., so we had to be out of the room by 7:15. This stinks because breakfast is not served until 7:30 on the weekends! So, we did not get our complimentary grub! I did get free coffee though and it was good. The shower curtain was stained and torn and the walls were kind of dirty. The furniture was worn down and the couch saggy. The TVs are older with not a whole lot to choose from. The ceiling obviously had a leak at one point and they tried to fix it, but it still looked bad. The fitness center and laundry facilities were closed due to \"issues\" - but they said they had a back-up plan if you needed it. The elevator was filthy and the carpets in the halls wet with big fans running all afternoon and evening. Another leak? Overall, the place was just \"OK.\" Not nearly as good as the reviews it has been getting.

We checked in quickly and efficiently, we were booked into a 2 bedroom suite on the fourth floor, so were not really bothered by noise at all. We were facing the outside area with the pool and basket ball court - so didn't have much of a view.

Breakfast provided each day was great - hot and continental, plenty to choose from - also a free dinner 3 nights in the week, which was also very good - although not much choice, it was still plentiful which made our stay very good value for money. We had our rooms serviced every day, what they called 'light housekeeping' - i.e. made beds, emptied bins, replaced used towels - which was more than enough. The pool area was good - never too busy, and towels were provided - our two teenaged boys enjoyed playing basketball, you could borrow balls from the reception. There was a business suite with free internet access which was very useful, a free laundry room, plenty of washers and dryers and quite a large fitness room. The hotel had plenty of restaurants in a small shopping centre next door which was very convenient, also a supermarket. Once we had got our bearings - it was quite quick and easy to visit the attractions in San Diego or to go downtown or to the beach.

Otherwise the rooms are quiet from side- to- side. The morning breakfasts were filling and kept us going every day. The hotel offered 3 nights of dinners for us which was nice and saved us additional money. This hotel is located in a corporate setting so it was a little hard to find places to eat.

Since I have stayed at this hotel so many times, I thought it was about time to share my experiences with the rest of the world! Every time I have stayed here, including this past one, I have to say that their customer service gets better and better! From the front desk staff to the lady running the breakfast buffet - they really try to make you feel like family!!! I don't like sounding like a clich\u00c3\u00a9, but it's true! When I say it is a good hotel for business travelers, I don't want you to think it is specifically for business because it is not!!! This hotel is in an area that really doesn't attract the typical family vacationers... It is in a business area in Northern San Diego County. The rooms are large and all have a full kitchen in them with dishwasher, refrigerator, stove and sink. The cabinets are even stocked with the basic kitchen items - glasses, plates, bowls, cooking utensils, pots, pans, etc. Comes in handy if you are trying to cut your expenses and cook instead of eat out every meal! The beds are very comfortable and I seem to get some of the best nights sleep at this hotel than any other hotel I have stayed at. Every morning, there is a free breakfast buffet down in the lobby. This isn't just your typical danish and coffee breakfast. They have hot scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, pancakes, waffles, and a daily special. When I first started staying here several years ago, this was a very extensive breakfast and has since scaled back a bit but still adequate! Very nice touch! If you are staying during the week, particularly a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday night, you have the opportunity to take advantage of their \"Sundowner\" event in the evenings. These take place from around 5:30 to 7:00pm on these nights and include a nightly special appetizer that can very well replace dinner if you don't feel like going out. To top it off, they include free wine and beer and soft drinks at this event!!! How can you beat that? Besides the typical hotel amenities, this hotel also has a back courtyard with barbecues you are allowed to use on a first come first served basis, half basketball court, and a very nice swimming pool. In all, I consider this hotel to be my good old reliable, you know what you're going to get, hotel. I really appreciate their customer service, attentiveness to problems, and how they go out of their way to make you feel at home.

This place is highly recommended, and if you visit the San Diego tourist attractions, you will almost always be travelling in the opposite direction to the rush hour traffic, dut to its location uptown. we will definitely be back!", "Date": "October 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3939403", "Content": "My husband and I were traveling with my elderly parents and wanted a hotel with a 2-bedroom suite instead of traditional, separate rooms.

Our room had a view of a car park and petrol station! The rooms are ok, just normal hotel-chain standard and although I would say they were clean I definitely could not say they were pristine. The bed linen on our king bed had faded stains on them and sorry but I like my hotel bedlinen pristine white. The pool was extremely small, almost plunge pool size but fortunately wasn't overcrowded at all despite the hotel seeming so full (lots of teenage soccer teams staying) but thankfully this wasn't an issue for our two kids who love to be in the pool a lot. You need to be aware that the location is near an Airforce base and there were lots of jets screaming past overhead when we were using the pool - very loud! The hotel offered complimentary breakfast and sundowner appetizers but both were of poor quality and if you didn't get to breakfast before 9am (+ we didn't), there didn't appear to be anything left in terms of pastry and bakery items or yougurts, plenty of bread for toast and boiled eggs etc + cereal if that's what you want. We had a problem with a blocked toilet cistern within the first hour of checking in but the girl at front desk said she had no-one to send up so she offered the plunger to my husband to use himself (nice!) this might be a problem for some people. I did use the free guest laundry facilities and my husband used the small gym which were both good. The sofa bed for the kids was unmade (I did expect it to be made up as I made the reservation for 2 adults and 2 children) and I had to ask for extra blankets and pillows to make it up, also it was very hard with a really cheap mattress and hard springs and my 8yr old daughter complained it was uncomfortable despite my best efforts at making it softer for her to lie on by placing an extra blanket beneath the sheet. It really WAS horribly uncomfortable. On the whole, the bedlinen was below standard, I hate those nylon-type bedspreads, yuk - they're so cheap and nasty - NOT want we want. Toiletries for the bathroom were sparse - 1 tiny bottle of shampoo & 2 bars of soap and no shower cap and the 'light' cleaning was only the bedmaking and change of towels. I accept the toiletries are replaced but on first impressions it looked a bit mean. The hotel location was good if you wanted to visit Del Mar and La Jolla but definitely not anywhere near downtown San Diego which was a minimum 20 min drive south on a slow highway so don't stay here if you think it's San Diego. This was not a 'terrible' experience but judged on our overall experience I would not stay here again and would research my location more thoroughly. I would agree with the review that said the hotel was under-staffed - there just didn't seem to be a lot of staff around! You can definitely do better than staying here!!", "Date": "August 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "central connecticut", "Title": "\u201cNice Stay\u201d", "Author": "orchidboy", "ReviewID": "UR3747086", "Content": "Stayed 07/30 to 08/02.

While there were some positive attributes, the hotel doesn't compare favorably with Residence Inns or Embassy Suites. Perhaps it's under new management, but it certainly doesn't deserve all the raves on this site. We will stick to Marriotts or Embassy Suites from now on. First the positives: the pool and basketball courts were nice and welcomed by my family; the free laundry facilities were nice to have after a week on the road (and surprisingly available); the location is convenient to attractions in La Jolla, Del Mar and north San Diego and not too inconvenient to downtown (although lacking in any real San Diego \"flavor\"). The negatives, which we feel outweighed the positives: The one-bedroom King Suite was very small. There was barely room to lay out suitcases for our family of four and have room to walk. The pull-out couch in the living room extended completely to the television cabinet so that it was impossible to make up (the bed was not made up and we had to request mattress pad, sheets, blanket and pillows to do it ourselves). Furthermore, the mattress was so uncomfortable that we had to pull it off the bed frame and lay it on the floor. The sleeper sofa was an obviously cheap piece of furniture and has not worn well. The bed linens for the king bed were so worn out and scratchy that it felt like sand in the bed. When will hotel chains realize that customers won't tolerate uncomfortable beds and linens? The lay-out of the bedroom was also most inconvenient. The bathroom door opened into the closet so that trying to get into the closet and maneuver around the bathroom was awkward. The doors to the outside hallway are so thin, you can hear every word spoken and every TV. The hotel was nearly full, yet management had only assigned one poor woman to manage the breakfast \"buffet\". The food was of poor quality, there was not enough of the hot (microwaved) food and no employee was assigned to clear tables or empty overflowing trashcans. We opted to purchase our own cold cereal and poptarts so as not to have to deal with the mess! I felt sorry for the woman who had to handle nuking the food and refilling everything by herself each morning! Overall, I'd say the property is poorly managed and understaffed for the size of the hotel. However, even improved management and new bed and bath linens cannot compensate for the lack of size and cheap furniture in the \"suites.\" Skip this one and head to the Residence Inn across the road.", "Date": "August 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Assonet, MA", "Title": "\u201cConvenient to all SD attractions\u201d", "Author": "It's a Red Sox Nation", "ReviewID": "UR3732910", "Content": "Although this hotel is not in downtown SD, it never claimed to be.

The pool and patio area were exceptionally nice - our three made great friends there- and they enjoyed playing sports outside. The large lounge was a delight to chill in especially as there was tea and coffee there on tap(it seemed designed in the manor of an English country house). It was great having the laundry facilities completely free of charge - we didnt even have to buy detergent. The only downside was the distance from San Diego - about 30 minutes along the freeway! As for facilities nearby we didnt go to the shopping centre but the numerous takeaways were great for a quick bite to eat.

The kitchen was tiny and very misleasding from the pictures on the website. The location of the hotel was NOT 15 minutes from Seaworld and tha airport. You had to get on 3 different freeways just to get to this hotel. The drive was about 30 minutes with all the traffic because it's located in an industrial area. The next two days were even worse. The housecleaners never cleaned our room the first night we were there and for the 2nd day we came back to our room around 4:30PM and our room was still not cleaned. It was quite upsetting with the service we were recieving. To top iit all off the air conditioner leaked all over the rug in 2nd bedrrom suite.

The front of the hotel was on the same side as a main traffic street (Mesa Blvd). The windows were nowhere near soundproof so open or closed, all the traffic noise came in. When I asked to change rooms, there was a sense that they didn't try too hard to find a different one, so I was stuck for the first night. I thought that it might be ok, it wasn't. If you don't mind traffic noise, an unusually loud refrigerator and the charge whether you like the room or not [stay or leave]...... I called the Marriott Residence Inn's toll free number. They found me an excellent room, at a lower rate, so I repacked the car and left the next day. I highly recommend the Marriott Residence Inn in Sorrento. The room was nice.
