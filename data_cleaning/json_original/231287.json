As many previous reviews have already stated, they were all very, very friendly and helpful. Particularly, I would like to thank those members of staff (all of them!) who helped me with my conversational Italian. I left England with no Italian whatsoever, but returned almost fluent \u2013 well OK, so I exaggerate a bit there! Prior to our trip, Marco wrote to us to see if we wanted to have a taxi pick us up at the airport, which was very helpful, and we were tempted. However, since the hotel was less than 10 mins by foot from Termini Station, we decided to take the \u201cMy Terravision\u201d bus, which saved us \u20ac92 over the two journeys, which we figured would be better off put towards a bottle or two of wine! On arrival at the hotel, we were given a detailed map of Central Rome, which was brilliant because it listed all the streets, as opposed to the maps in our guidebooks which only showed the larger streets. We had a rough idea what we were going to do with several walks planned, so this map was well used. Bear in mind that it is not really necessary to use Public Transport, so comfortable shoes are essential. Just ask my wife!!!!! Apart from the walks, we went on one of the \u201chop on, hop off\u201d buses. We stayed on for a complete circuit before carrying on to our destination. It cost \u20ac21 each (valid for 24 hours), but it gives you a different perspective of the city, plus the commentary is very interesting. We wanted to do a boat trip too, but it was too early in the season, and so they were not running. We didn\u2019t do the Vatican tour, but if you do, pre-book your tickets and go first thing in the morning, as the queues become vast as the day goes on. We went to football (wherever we go my wife insists that we go!!), but beware! I don\u2019t know about Lazio tickets (Marco will tell you where to get them from), but AS Roma tickets were only available from the club shop in The Piazza Colonna, off the Via Del Corso, and not from any of the other Roma shops, as far as I know. You will need a passport or driving licence (with a photo on, I think) for each ticket, and you must take this ID with you when you go to the ground. We\u2019re a couple in our late 50\u2019s but our ID was checked three times at the ground!. Also, you cannot get tickets on the day of the game. Our tickets said the KO was 1500, but when we went back to the Dorica to get the tickets and passports, Marco told us that it was a 1230 KO, and despite his getting us a taxi to get to the ground, we still missed the start of the match. So get your hotel to check when the KO is, if you go to the football, and don\u2019t forget your passports. Apart from the walks during the day, the other thing we did was the \u201cGhost and Mystery Walking Tour (pre-book on viator.com). This was not actually a ghost walk at all, but featured some of the \u201cdark side\u201d of Rome\u2019s history, and was very interesting and enjoyable. It was well worth doing, but we were flagging by the end of it (after walking all day, the walk was from 2115 to about 2315). I won\u2019t go into detail of the main sites to see, as you\u2019ll all have your own ideas as to what you want to see, so now it\u2019s time for the important stuff. Obviously drinks are expensive in the centre, so buy your water at a supermarket before your reach the centre. There are many \u201cDESPAR\u201d and \u201cCARREFOUR\u201d supermarkets around, so you\u2019ll soon find one. If you stop for a beer and people watch, bear in mind that there is usually a three tier price system. It is cheaper to stand up at the bar/counter, a bit more for a table indoors and dearer still to sit outside. We did pay \u20ac6 for a beer (0.2L), so be warned. There are many eating places that do set menus, and we did one on the night that we did the \u201cGhost Walk\u201d, and it was very good, so don\u2019t be put off by thinking that the quality/quantity will be poor. We actually ate close to the hotel on all five nights, and although our bill varied between \u20ac30 to \u20ac90 (drinks cost us over half of this last one), the best meal we had was at EST-EST-EST, across from the hotel, off the Via Palermo. I\u2019m not one who would normally rave over a pizza, but the Calzone was one of the best tasting meals I\u2019ve ever had. We had to go back next day too! (Bear in mind that it closes on Mondays, and that many other restaurants close on a Sunday.) A shared starter, two Calzone Pizzas and two Tiramisu desserts, and a litre of house white cost us \u20ac40. It was a divine meal. Having had five full days in Rome, we did everything that we wanted to do, so we would not expect to return, however, the Calzone Pizzas at EST-EST-Est are a tempting prospect!!! I\u2019m sure there are many other tips I could pass on if I could remember them, but you\u2019ll just have to make do with one more. When crossing the roads, pray first, close your eyes, and proceed as quickly as possible! Seriously, though, when crossing, try to cross at traffic lights when the green man says it\u2019s OK, but watch out for cars driving either side of you. DO NOT STOP ON A CROSSING as the drivers work out whether to pass in front or behind you. If you stop, then I wouldn\u2019t bother wasting any money in the Trevi Fountain! Enjoy.

Location - An easy walk to the Metro station at Piazza della Repubblica; also walkable from the Termini (especially if you're traveling light); very close to Via Nazionale, which is a very good non-touristy street for shopping (in fact, there are clothing-stores almost next door to the Dorica); a pleasant walk up the Quirinale to the Piazza di Santa Barberini, and further to the Spanish Steps and beyond (del Popolo); very close to the Maggiore cathedral; longer walks (a great thing to do in Rome!) or reasonable cab fares to the Colosseum and Forum in one direction, or to the Pantheon and Piazza Navona; not a lot of fine restaurants in the hotel's proximity, but quite a few very good coffee bars (at which, in Italy, there's also plenty to eat) 2. Breakfast (currently, 7:00 to 9:30) - Without being sensational, the Dorica's breakfast is more than adequate (a number of hotels have this sort of package); espresso is available on demand; Mario, Diana and their young assistant, with their great service, ensure a pleasant start to the morning; if you want more, there's the large Caffe Morganti next door (this used to be the Gran Caffe Piacente; Morganti is also good for buying a quick bottle of water, or for having a drink in the evening) 3. Service - I saw less of the gregarious owner, Peter, during this (my second) stay, but that's because he has very efficient people working at the hotel now; the spiffy Marco is a great communicator in English and will make sure to arrange airport transfers and to check with you on your experience with the taxi and the hotel; the taxis they work with are usually Mercedes Benz cars that can hold lots of luggage comfortably; Florian is often doing the night shift; both he and Marco are knowledgeable about Rome and can play concierge very well; Mario and Diana must be two of the nicest people in Italy, and Peter one of the funniest! 4. Rooms - Quite spacious, by European standards, especially in the most-visited cities such as Rome; the tiled bathrooms are evidently newer than the rooms; the shower-stalls are much less cumbersome than slippery bath-tubs elsewhere; some will appreciate that the shower can be hand-held too; shampoo and bath gel in packets are provided; to complete a fine shower experience that the tiled bathrooms seem to be suited for, bring your own cosmetics 5. Other Aspects - a. The reception is one level up from the street. If you have luggage, you could take the quaint elevator/lift. Remember that the elevator doesn't respond to buttons being pressed unless the grill-door is closed. b. At a few times, the hotel can seem noisy, but that's usually only when there are several guests in the breakfast-room. I slept very well every night. c. They do try to offer a free wireless connection to the InterNet, but with a ministry building right across the street, the connection can be flaky. d. Someone is behind the reception-desk at all times; if you return very late in the night to the hotel, ring the doorbell at the street-door 6. Room Charges - Very reasonable; very attractive off-season rates; if you get the super-discounted rates, be prepared to pay by cash (there are ATMs a couple of doors from the hotel); overall, great value for the money; plus, they do accommodate special requests, as for a specific room number/description Hotel Dorica is a great way to stay in comfort, while enjoying wonderful service, and to save some money for other Rome experiences such as food and shopping. It's family-run and the employees take the smooth operation of the hotel seriously. In my view, Dorica is a more charming experience than a chain hotel, without compromise on safety and comfort. Having a solid, metal key to the room is nice by itself. (Remember it's easier to turn it in at the front desk, when you go out.)

Good Points: 1. This is a family-run hotel and the staff are extremely welcoming, friendly and helpful. Their recommendations for places to eat were excellent, and their advice on travelling in Rome was also extremely useful. They even allowed us to leave our luggage in a secure room at the hotel on our last day after checking out, as our flight home was not until the evening. 2. The breakfast is superb. The same things are provided each day but there is sufficient variety (inc. rolls, pastries, yoghurt, cereal, cheese) that it does not become boring. We looked forward to it every morning. 3. The location is perfect for exploring the centre of Rome, particularly if you are looking to visit ancient Rome (the Colosseum etc) or Christian Rome (the Vatican etc). It is within easy walking distance of Rome's central railway station (Termini) from which you can ride the Metro around the city centre or take mainline trains further out. There are also plenty of bus services but we didn't make use of them. I wouldn't recommend trying to park a car here, or anywhere in Rome city centre for that matter. 4. The room was very clean, comfortable and warm, ideal for coming back to after a day walking around the city. There was a shower in our bathroom but no bath, though this was not a problem for us. 5. We were able to book 7 nights for the price of 6 which made our holiday a little cheaper than anticipated! Bad Points: 1. When we made the booking, we were told by the online service that it included a free pickup service to/from the airport. When I contacted the hotel to arrange when and where this would take place, I was told it was no longer available, but no reason was given for this change. Fortunately it is possible to get a direct nonstop train (for 14 euros per person) from Fiumicino airport to Rome's central station (Termini) and then the hotel is within easy walking distance. 2. At the same time as finding about about the airport pickup no longer being available, I was also informed our booking hadn't been completed due to an error made while filling it in online. The error was rectified and the booking made, but we had not been told about it despite making the booking weeks in advance. If I hadn't contacted the hotel to ask about the airport pickup, we could conceivably have arrived thinking our booking had been completed, when it hadn't. 3. Noise level can be a problem for light sleepers, either from adjoining rooms or from the street outside. In fairness there isn't much they can do about this, and if you want peace and quiet on holiday then you are unlikely to be going to the centre of Rome anyway. In summary: this is a lovely hotel with a great location which I would instantly recommend - but be very careful to confirm that your booking has gone through and what exactly it includes!", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cCharming place\u201d", "Author": "NYCnative76", "ReviewID": "UR89174498", "Content": "I had made a booking here last minute as I'd changed plans and needed to come in a day earlier.

Terrible mattress. Lacking amenities. Stayed there with a group, and was in the large room between the dining room and the owner's office, overlooking the piazza. The noise from the street was apparent even with the windows/shades shut, so I wore earplugs every night. But the earplugs did not drown out the noise the owner made \u2013 I always knew when he was around, as he didn\u2019t talk, he yelled. Loudly. Continually. His loud voice was what I heard first thing early every morning \u2013 through the earplugs! And if he was having an argument with his wife, who was at the hotel frequently, and they were frequently arguing, the noise was on par with a jack hammer that didn\u2019t cease. The guy barely came up for air on one afternoon-long argument. Unfortunately I had to do a lot of paperwork while in Rome, so was in the room often and rarely had quiet. After several days, I asked him to lower his voice in the hallway, and he began yelling at me! And then the rest of my stay, he would barely look at me nor would he serve me breakfast in the dining room. He obviously does not like people telling him what to do in his own hotel. But he did stop pawing me after this. However, my feeling is that they advertise the place as \u201cquiet and serene\u201d which it was definitely NOT whenever the owner was in! My mattress, a double bed, was unbearably uncomfortable. Hard, lumpy, and covered with a RUBBER sheet directly under the linens (unbelievable!), it was the worst bed I\u2019ve ever slept on in Italy (and that includes when I was a starving student in dive hotels). The mattress had to be about 30 years old. I asked the owner\u2019s son, who also works at the hotel, for a blanket to put under me and got a little lecture about how good a hard mattress is. He would only give me one very old small blanket, saying he couldn\u2019t find any other. The next day another worker in the hotel found several thick blankets in the same closet for me. With two blankets folded in half under me, the bed was bearable for the rest of my stay. But a mattress pad is needed, if not a new mattress, for any comfort. The room is equipped with glaring florescent reading lights attached to the walls next to the bed and overhead. There is no light for the desk. There is no bureau, but a built in armoire with a couple of hangers. The safe in the room never worked. The smell of cigarette smoke was frequently in my room, which came from the wife, who would smoke in the dining room under the 'Vietato Fumare' sign. Other than smoking in the non smoking hotel, she was a very pleasant person who was always gracious. The internet was spotty the first fews days and then went out for days, no connection. The good points about the hotel: the two room cleaners, Mario and Diana, are so nice, so efficient and so sweet that when they were around, and the owner wasn't, it was a lovely place. The shower in the room\u2019s very clean bathroom was strong and always had hot water. The rooms are larger than many I've seen in Italy and the ones overlooking the piazza are bright and sunny.

He's worldly-wise and funny. He and his daughter, Emmanuella, run a very efficient hotel. The breakfast is good, although not elaborate, but the service ensures you have a good start to your morning.

As previous reviewers noted, the real beauty is the location. Walkable to many sights, and an easy 10 minutes to Termini. It felt safe and quiet at night. Our stay was short so we wanted something near the train station. For a longer stay I'd recommend trying to find something near Piazza Navona or Campo dei Fiori--it's great being in the heart of the historic center for evening passegiata.

I'm really glad that I stayed there. Although it was a bit more expensive than I wanted (130 Euros per night in high season for a single ), it was definitely worth the money. Cleanliness, location, and staff - all fabulous. Room: The room was a small single (maybe 6'X8' at most; the high ceilings helped make it feel not so confining) but it was immaculate - totally clean and neat - and it was a welcome haven at the end of a long day. The mattress was firm but comfortable, and I slept really well. I would really recommend that you try to get a room away from the elevator or the entryway. People coming in and out from the elevator and the sound of the door shutting got old fast. Overall, though, the hotel was very quiet. I never heard anyone else in any of the actual rooms around me. Sites: The beauty of the Dorica is its location: I was able walk to the Termini train station, the Spanish steps, Trevi Fountain, the Colloseum, and the Forum within 15 -20 minutes. The best tip I got was this: Take the metro to St. Peter's and climb the dome early in the morning while you're still fresh, THEN go to the Vatican museum later after lunch, when the crowds lessen. I arrived at St. Peter's at 8:15 and got in in 15 minutes. I climbed the dome first, then walked around the basilica. Afterwards, I went and had a nice, early lunch a few blocks up. At noon, I went back to the Vatican, and the line to get in was half the size it was in the morning. I got into the Vatican in 20 minutes. Shopping: If you like shopping, you're right next to the Via Nazionale. If you walk out of the hotel and turn right, you'll hit Via Nazionale one block up. Then turn left on Via Nazionale, and there are tons of clothing stores and shoe stores. Internet: Walk out of the hotel and turn right until you hit Via Nazionale. Turn right at Via Nazionale, then walk 2 blocks to Via Napoli . Turn right at Via Napoli, and you'll find an internet cafe (behind the Irish pub). They don't really seem to have internet access at the hotel for guests except for emergencies (from what I could tell) so this cafe was great. Snack Food: Walk out of hotel, go right until you come to Via Nazionale. Go right on Via Nazionale. Walk 2 blocks up to Via Firenze, and there's a guy on the corner on the right hand side with a fruit stand who sells fruit, water, soda, beer, and snacks. He was there every evening too. Supermarket: Walk out of the hotel and go left, then turn left at Via del Viminale. You'll find a supermarket on the left. (It's literally right around the corner, but it's mostly underground - Check with Gianni about the street name for this one). Restaurants: When you walk out of the hotel, you'll see the Via Palermo on the right hand side. Down that street are little shops with yogurt, fruit , and slices of pizza. If you keep walking down that street about 5 blocks, you'll come to a cool little street called Via del Boschetto. There's a little market there and dozens of inexpensive, romantic restaurants. Staff: Gianni/John and Antonio, the clerks at the hotel were extremely helpful with suggesting places to go to dinner (Pasta Love, for example), for gifts, great gelati, and itineraries. It was great talking to them every evening when I returned from a long day. Super helpful, and both speak English. Breakfast: The same every day, yes, but it was enough to get me going in the morning. Killer cappuccino too. Tip: wait for the woman to come to you to serve you. Don't try to get up and get anything yourself. :) One last thing - I am a woman in my early 30's, and was traveling alone. I was felt totally safe walking around alone, sometimes even in the late evening (after about 9:30pm or so, though, I would say have it's best to have someone with you because it can be a bit dark. Just keep your wits about you). Overall , I would definitely stay there again!
