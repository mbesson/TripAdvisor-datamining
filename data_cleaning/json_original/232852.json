From the outside, hotel daniela certainly did look a fab little hotel. once inside the miniscule room though, the picture was completely different, the walls were rotten, wallpaper was torn and there was black mold on the wall right by the bottom of the bed. The bathroom was actually bigger than the room but the shower is awful and looks like the lime scale on ALL the attachments has been breeding for years, you also share it with a little gang of red ants, who like to go on day trips to the bed and bite you on the legs!!!! When I asked for a room change, i was basically told NO, by an extremely arrogant and snotty receptionist. Up until \"antgate\", I thought i was stuck in this room, but thankfully there was a young man on reception at night who had manners, excellent customer service and deserves a pay rise and praise for his speedy response and organising a room change. This was after 2 days of the room from hell. During the day, don't think of a lie in as housekeeping knocks continuously and then get reception to phone the room. If you say no and don't open the door, it generally means you don't want to be pestered.

This hotel is supposedly a \"3 star\" hotel...I wouldn't even give it one star. When we arrived, our room had three beds in a tiny space and was extremely hot inside. When we tried to turn on the air conditioner, it only blew out warm air. We asked the staff to come look at it and he laughed (like he knew it was broken) and said he knew what was wrong and told us someone would come the next morning to look at it. So, the next day we asked again and they said these things \"take time\". Ok, whatever. We went out for the day and then came back that night and asked about it again. They told us someone would have to come out the next day to put the freon in it and so we asked for a fan because it was miserably hot. The guy called someone and then told us they had none. The next day, we asked again...and were told they couldn't help us. After getting angry and asking for a fan again or a different room, the guy got on the phone to call someone again. While he was on the phone, a few people came in behind us to check in. We told them how horrible the service was and how no one seemed to care enough to help us out. We did this in front of the desk staff who was on the phone, and miraculously they have a fan for us now. So we stayed there 3 nights and they never even tried to help us out at all. In addition to that, our shower water was either ice cold or scalding hot, there was no in-between. And there were cockroaches in the hallways.

Drab decor, creepy iconography, rock-hard bed, and paper thin pillows, but other than that, it was serviceable. It seemed like the place was very short-staffed in the cleaning department. The same dead cockroach that was in the hallway when we checked in was still there two days later when we checked out. The thing that really bothered me was the water. It smelled of sulphur and the stench permeated the bathroom all the time. The shower also only dispensed either scalding or freezing water. No internet access in this hotel for guests, and no TV channels in English, which normally wouldn't bother me at all, but since we were stranded, I wanted to keep updated on the volcano situation. Fortunately I understand French and was able to tune into a Swiss news channel. The hotel location is near the Manzoni stop on the metro, about a twenty minute walk from Termini.

The staff was extremely rude to us. We went in Nov. 02 also, and there was NO phone service in our rooms. The second day at breakfast there was a cockroach on the table next to us. The last day they lost our key, which you're required to hand in when coming and going (common in Europe) and gave us an extra but refused to give us a different room and claimed they were sure the maid had it. Luckily our things were still in the room and we were able to pile furniture in front of the door that night, our last in Rome and at that hotel, thankfully.", "Date": "September 2, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cWould not come back\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1135692", "Content": "Hotel Daniela is on a quiet, tree-lined, residential street and we felt very safe.
