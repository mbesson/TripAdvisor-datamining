We stayed in room 5, It is a very small room but was cleaned to a high standard, the ensuite is very small, if l am being very critical there was was one broken tile by the toilet and the bath had lost enamel in one small area, but again it was cleaned to a high standard. The air conditioning wasn't working, the room was too warm.The queen sized bed was firm and comfortable which was fine by me, we slept well. You can hear the sound of the London underground as the train pass closeby, l know this issue was raised by previous guests and also the size of the small televisions in the room, but l dont go away to sit in a room all day and night to watch TV and listen to the underground. Breakfast was my sticking point, this is where the hotel failed it wasn't a full English, there were only mushrooms, bacon and powdered scrabbled eggs, If you enjoy continental breakfast then its fine, although some of the products used weren't of the best quality, in particular the cereals. The cereal dispensing area was very untidy. Tea and coffee is self service from a vending type machine, pots of tea and coffee served to the table would be a far better idea. We had to wait a few minutes for a table to be prepared as the breakfast room was busy at 0900. To give credit, l submitted the satisfaction survey to the hotel on departure, highlighting these points and the manager responded withing 24 hours by e-mail This was part of his reponse to the breakfast and the air conditioning. Regarding your comments about the breakfast I would like to point out that the breakfast that all bookings include (as advertised also in the website Booking.com) is a buffet breakfast (not an English breakfast) that is the reason why there is only few hot products in the selection offer. Nevertheless we offer our guests the possibility to have a full English breakfast at an additional cost of \u00a33.

The pool is why I am guessing the hotel has been rated as a 4 Star. Apart from this everything else is 2 star. The rooms are small, very basic but clean. Walls are paper thin and you can hear everything (and I mean everything) from the next room! Floorboards are old and creaky. Breakfast room is dated but with a flat screen TV in. The breakfast itself is fine if you stick to the continental but the hot food was gross, solidified egg, cold beans and something that resembled a sausage - not good! On the whole, it is a hotel that is really trying it's best but does need a lot of money and effort spent on it to be able to compete with other hotels in the area. Ok for a stay of one or two nights but no more.

Our room smelt appallingly of stale cigarette smoke, and was very small - not at all like the rooms in the pictures. I complained, but was told that all rooms are non-smoking, and so there couldn't be any smell. The room was also scruffy, more like a hostel than a four-star hotel. The carpet was so filthy that we initially thought we had black mould - in fact, we only had black mould on the window. Rubbish had piled up outside said window and was actually leaning on the glass, so we had to keep the curtains closed. The headboard was broken, as was the mirror in the bathroom. What really annoyed my partner, though, was the lack of biscuits with the tea making facilities. Breakfast was truly, inspiringly awful. The eggs were powdered, the mushrooms tinned, the sausages of unidentifiable origin. On the other hand, the fresh fruit was nice. This was a relief, after the appalling experience of drinking the acid-like fruit juice. This, after smelling cigarette smoke all night and listening to people in the next room and in the corridor outside, was simply too much, and I complained. I was told that I couldn't complain, because there was no manager there that day, but the \"trainee\" (I kid you not) who was left on his own from when we checked in at 5pm to when we left at 10am, would pass my comments on.

But upon arriving the outside of the hotel was covered in scaffolding and the entrance had big wooden boards along the walkway. as we entered the reception the carpet looked like it had lost a fight with an angry tiger, and the sofas looked like they could have been pulled from a skip. The hotel's only saving grace were 2 of the reception staff who were fairly helpful. We got into the lift (which was claustrophobic to say the least) which took us to our floor. as we stepped out onto the hall the creaking on the floor was terrible, but assumed once we were in the room we would not hear it. We were very wrong, and as our room was right next to the lift we could hear that, plus the loud noise of trains going past every 10 minutes. The room itself was very dated, but clean. However, and without any exaggeration, the space around the small double bed could have been no more than half a metre each side. It can only be described as a box room. In fact the bathroom was probably only marginally smaller than the main room, which, when there is only room for a shower, sink and toilet, is saying something! My boyfriend and I have stayed in a few less than perfect hotels, and usually laugh it off, but this was beyond any humour. So he went to complain to reception and ask edto be moved to a bigger room or one that wasn't next to the lift. He was told by a member of staff that all the rooms were exactly the same size and if we wanted to be moved we would have to wait until morning. With nothing else left to do about the situation we got some very interrupted sleep, hoping the next day would be better. As we walked to the lift for breakfast the next morning a different room door was opened for cleaning, and when we looked into it, it was very clearly much bigger than our room, which just angered us even more after realising the reception staff had outright lied about the sizes of the rooms. So as we sit for breakfast (after choosing the full english buffet option rather than only continental), we went to get food. I'm not sure where the hotel staff have had a \"full english\" before, but this is certainly not what was on offer. in fact the only \"full english\" items available were sausages, scrambled egg and mushrooms. The only juice available was tropical, and the quality of it all was very low. I have never ever felt the need to write a review about the bad state of a hotel before now. It is a clean hotel, and 2 of the many staff we met were friendly enough, but those were the only good things. We were moved to a slightly bigger room, but by then the damage had been done, and our romantic weekend had been dampened significantly. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone for any occasion.

It was not too difficult to put two and two together and work out that 'the hot water is not working' was just another excuse!! Another 2 guests who arrived after me, were able to stay on the floor where 'the hot water was not working' (the staff did not know that I was listening) & were told there was no problem with the water...when I told them what had happened to me!!

We made use of the swimming pool very acceptable- good supply of towels and changing facilities - no one else was in it so we had it to ourselves then went back to room to rest and get ready to go out to evening show. Hotel was nicely situated we used Lancaster Gate underground could also use Queensgate. Our show was at Prince Edward Theatre(Old Compton Rd.). Just to say we could hear the underground trains - but this was not a problem for us-it was quite nice actually, but if you are noise sensitive then...... Breakfast in the dining rm was very good selection and very helpful pleasant staff who kept everything tidy, topped up+all fresh. Overall we were delighted after having read some of the reviews submitted so far before we went and after having booked lastmin. Agreed it is not 4* but maybe because of the swimming pool it gets this rating. We did have a good package deal on lastmin. So if you were booking at normal rates you may consder this point.

It's more or less the pool which makes it worth it, cause the rooms are very small. Stayed in a single, and it's the smallest hotel room I've ever seen. It's not \"smallish\", it's 100% tiny. Asked the staff about size of triple rooms, which they described as spacious. Looked into one and spacious isn't exactly how I would describe it, unless you are abnormly high and need a really high ceiling. Anyway, I think both the hotel and the triple room is a great choise for families. The rates are reasonable in my opinion, payed 79 pounds for a single room, breakfast included.The hotel is in need of some serious refurbishing. Carpets very worn out, lots of old stains, scratches and marks, both in room and staircases. The door to my room was hard to close, had to slam it hard. Guess that wasn't the favourite sound of those living next door. The location itself is very quiet though, no traffic noise or bars to keep you awake. Unless you visit one. :-) Be aware that several websites says the hotel offers smoking rooms. This is not correct, no smoking througout the premises. Bathroom was small but clean. Small shower which had plenty of hot water, but was very difficult to adjust. Trying to get a little lower temperature made it stop, then it gave another flush of boiling hot water - so be careful, adjust before you step into it. The room provided most of what you'll need, a small tv, a small desk (no chair), coffee and tea making facilities and a large and comfy bed. Aircondition to be installed, not in use yet. Safe in room, free of charge. Unfortunately there's no fridge or minibar to keep cold drinks. Very good breakfast, full English and a impressive buffet for a 3-star hotel in London. Staff polite and service minded. Carpets without stains and scratches would have given a much better overall impression! Pool is not very big, but then it doesn't seem to be used by too many guests either. Wonder why, but it's fine with me - had the pool all to myself.
