For that it was an excellent value: clean, quite, breakfast is good, receptionists are friendly.

We had a triple room, a really good size, small bathroom but separate toilet, so made it easier. The room was quite warm because of the afternoon sun, we asked for a fan, it was delivered to the room without any fuss. The breakfast is probably one of the best we've had at a similar three star hotel in Europe - great variety including cereals, fresh fruit and pastries, all served in a bright, airy room overlooking a pretty coutyard. The staff were really helpful with giving directions, suggestions for restaurants, etc. There is a wonderful Vietnamese restaurant just a few doors away, don't miss it, also a good Greek restaurant nearby. The subway and buses are really close to the hotel, it takes a while to get to the city but it's a nice experience by bus, you get to see so much of the suburbs.

It is quite some distance from city centre but the train system is so good that it is not a problem getting around. There is a Karstadt dept store on the corner and banks with ATMS. Also food kiosks on the street for currywurst, fries etc. the hotel room was a good size with full bath. The TV was all German except for CNN but the reception was not good for it so I used my Ipod and speaker system for music. The room faced a busy street but I did not notice any noise as I live next to a major highway. They do have rooms facing the garden. There were no black out drapes so when the sun came up I woke up. The staff were wonderful at giving advice, arranging for my taxi to take me to the airport and coffee to get me going at 3am. the breakfast was EXCELLENT with a wide choice of breads, cereals, cheeses, cold cuts, fruit, juices, coffee, tea, yogurt. with such a good start to the day I needed very little lunch to tide me over to dinner. there are some great restaurants nearby- next door an Egyptian with calamari to die for. The german restaurant on the next corner had great schnitzel. an excellent hotel in a major city at a very good price, great service and breakfast too.
