A clean room where I can shower, sleep and go to the bathroom is all I need. So it takes a lot for me to give a place a bad review. The good: the guy who checked me in was very, very nice. The toilet, sheets and towels (paper thin) were clean. Free, good wi-fi signal. The bad: The couch smelled so musty that I put a towel over it before sitting on it. I couldn't close the bathroom window because the latch was broken off. The shower was filthy and didn't drain; I stood ankle deep in water. If you're lucky enough to get the loosely-termed \"suite\" you can see the downtown skyline off in the distance, just over the adult video store. All of the other rooms look out on the boarded up motel across the street. The vinyl backing was falling off the curtains, which made for interesting light patterns on them in the morning. And a lampshade had these weird, old water stains. I'm only assured by the fact that the stains went all the way around that it wasn't something more ... bodily oriented. Overall the place was just ratty. I really liked the thick, one inch wide border of ancient dust that circumnavigated the entire room, right where the vacuum cleaner can't reach it. Also, the motel can't be blamed for this, but the traffic noise on Hwy. 99 is terribly loud. This is also the first time I've ever seen what can only be described as wilting plastic flowers. I stayed here once before a couple of years ago in a non-smoking room that smelled like an ashtray. Buzzing refrigerator kept me up all night. Never wanted to stay again, but I didn't make the reservation this time and didn't recognize the name until I drove up to it. At which point my heart sank. The room was cheap. $59 in Seattle awfully low, but you'll get what you pay for. I didn't give it one star because I've stayed in worse. (Nothing will ever beat that awful stay in the thankfully-now-closed Pacific Motor Inn in Springfield, Oregon!)", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bothell, Washington", "Title": "\u201cThis place is disgusting!\u201d", "Author": "stephanie b", "ReviewID": "UR121674351", "Content": "Avoid this place like the plague!

Bad decision. We pulled in late, after 11. Parked, unloaded and went to bed. Room was very old looking but tidy enough. A strange smell which we never did identify punctuated our stay. I got up early, as i usually do, and went out for a walk to find a coffee and just scout around a bit. Wow. Across the street, almost like a bad movie; very run down motel, old white rag top Caddy in the lot with two other old Caddies parked as well. Two very obvious street walkers were out selling what their momma gave them and a guy came out of one of the rooms and yelled, and I quote\", Get your a#$ back in here right now B*&^h!\". This was 30 seconds into my walk. I was solicited twice in my short, unsuccessful walk to find a coffee, one for sex, the other a soft attempt to try and rob me. I walked back and booked the Space Needle Travellodge for almost the same price at 730 am; when I told them where I was, the lady said,\" OMG, get out of there, we will find you something immediately\".

It was late at night when I discovered that the television didn't work, so that is why they didn't replace it immediately. I wasn't visiting Seattle to watch TV anyway. I wasn't in my room for most of the time I was in town. It was clean and comfortable, however I thought the towels were too scratchy. They should either get better towels or use fabric softener. It is walking distance from Archie McPhee's and several bus stops. I walked to the Fremont area in about 15 minutes. The staff recommended a good restaurant for me too. I would stay here again.

It was just as clean, one bed. table w/ chairs, frig, micro, wifi, HBO. The difference from the other \"cheap\" motels is only a few dollars but they treat you like a guest, not afraid to leave your clothes etc. in room, nothing is missing from rooms such as garbage cans, toilet paper holders, door or window knobs/locks, and the towels are thicker than rags.

The buses into downtown and the Space Needle run right by the motel. You have to walk over a bridge and down about 4 blocks, but they're every 15 minutes. The only thing we actually noticed not up to snuff was that the towels were a little threadbare. All and all, this is great stopover value for a motel that is so close to downtown.
