Located in S. Toma, just a 3 minute walk from the vaporetto stop, it is a great spot from which to venture out into the city. I would recommend reserving an upper room facing the courtyard. (Stairs only) This lends for a quieter room with a nice morning view through the shuttered windows. Breakfast is just fine... has an abundance of fresh cold cuts cereals, bread, jam, & a pretty decent cappuccino. Staff does a great job all the way around. Great support at the front desk, service and housekeeping as well. The main thing about this place is location & accommodation. Both are great...just minutes from just about anywhere... e.g. 10 minutes from the Academia, 10 minutes from Piazzo San Giacomo, 3 minutes to Campo S. Toma. & minutes from a great chichetti in any direction. Weather is perfect during this time of year. Would also recommend having lunch on the Fondamenta Nuove. Great views Murano/Cemetery etc... situated right on the water! Spectacular.. all the action is on the water, so its nice...no crowds.

Also keep also in mind that you have to leave the room and deliver the key to the reception until the latest 10.30am. Generally, the hotel is 10-15 minutes walk from the main attractions. The room was slightly spacious, a little bit noisy but seemed clean enough. The double bed was actually 2 single beds joined together.

The single room was small but it met the needs of my mother who found the room comfortable and the ensuite bathroom was very clean and a good size. My husband and I were given a double room next door which was a lot bigger than we expected, previous reports have stated the rooms are small but we did not find this to be the case. The bathroom was a very good size and overall the room was 10 times better than a 3 star hotel room which we stayed at in Paris. I ate breakfast only once but it was well presented and there was a choice of cereal, juice, croissants, yoghurt and bread. There was also some biscuits and french toast with jams and honey. The coffee was lovely and my mother who ate breakfast every day said it was always nice. The location of the hotel was amazing, less than a 10 minute from the bus station and only about 15 minutes from St. Marks square. There is an Irish bar on the corner and another bar right next door. Both were lively but the noise did not reach our rooms and it was nice to have somewhere close at hand to have a drink each night. We ate at 2 local restarants and found the food both excellent and reasonably priced. During the day when we visited areas such as St Marks square we paid approximately 16 euros for 2 coffees and a pint of Lager, in the bars near the hotel we got 2 glasses of very nice wine and a pint of lager for 7 euros. Overall the visit to Venice was amazing and I would recommend the Hotel Tivoli to any one as it was a charming well run very clean and exceptionally well priced hotel.", "Date": "February 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, New York", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful escape; but lots of stairs!\u201d", "Author": "LizzieandIzzy", "ReviewID": "UR5981134", "Content": "(Booked through venere) Hotel Tivoli is located in the San Pantalon area of Venice, just steps from the San Toma vaporetto stop. It is in a quaint, quiet narrow street near many shops, a couple of young people's bars (not too noisey, though), a pizzeria, a couple of great clothing stores, little restaurants, a tobacherria, and most conveniently, the San Toma stop. The San Margherita \"square\" (more like trapezoid) is a couple of blocks and bridges away, where you can feast on pasta or just sit, drink that fabulous Italian cofee, write postcards or read. Children of all ages live in the neighborhood and you can watch them play soccer on the square. A block away you can surreptitiously glance through the windows and see students in class at San Rocco. You honestly get a feeling that you really live in Venice when you stay at Hotel Tivoli. It is far enough away from San Marco that you can mix with the lovely Venetian local people instead of mostly tourists. I truly loved it and wished I had booked more time there. The hotel is much like the Venetian streets--lots of stairs like little bridges! So interesting--but not great if you have a lot of (or heavy) luggage. Loved the garden, which had roses blooming in mid-October, and other flowers besides. It was a wonderful, peaceful escape. I would definitely stay at Hotel Tivoli again. The price was extremely reasonable for Venice (Euro 50 per night for a single with shared bath; bath extremely clean always, shared with only 2 others whom I never saw), the staff very helpful (except for the signora serving breakfast, one morning--a little haggard and a bit brusque--not too helpful). I loved the fact that its location gave me the option of either taking the vaporetto or walking to where I wanted to go. Just one downside (for me personally--nothing to do with the hotel). I had booked a 6:15am KLM flight out of Venice. This was so stupid, I have to laugh! That meant somehow carting my (book-filled) luggage across the tiny streets and bridges in the middle of the night to get to the bus station, to get the 4:40 am bus to the airport. In the end I forfeited my last night at Tivoli and miraculously got another hotel much closer to the bus station, so I could sleep a bit longer and not get lost (in three days I got lost 5 times in Venice, and I am usually great with directions and maps).", "Date": "October 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for money\u201d", "Author": "SClayton", "ReviewID": "UR5693862", "Content": "We wanted a hotel that was a good price, but not far from the sights.

Breakfast was a choice of the usual continental items with a waitress politely serving tea & coffee. The hotel is about a 25 minute walk from San Marco, but what a great walk! We loved Venice and were happy with the two nights here. There is a restaurant on the corner (basic) and happily some late night bars just up the street. The riverboat station is very near too.
