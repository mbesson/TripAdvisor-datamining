Every day the cleaning lady did her job properly. 2) service at the reception desk was very good. All staff were very friendly and helpful. 3) location wise: it was perfect for us as it is away from the city centre and drunken tourist. A very quite and safe area. Not far to the sea front. Numerous buses going to the city centre. Though we walked( if you are fit we would recommend walking rather than taking a bus or metro). There are many good restaurants near by and local shops. The area itself is clean. 4) certainly it is a good value for what you pay. Our only disappointment was that the pool was closed, though this would would make a sense due to the weather. 5) we had a room on the 7 th floor with a sea view, decent size, good size bathroom. Unfortunately, Walls are not sound proofed. On one occasion I had to knock on next door as people slammed door every minute after 9pm, and kindly remind them that they are not alone in the hotel and should behave. In our 8 days stay I only did this once and it worked. Unfortunately, this hotel is family friendly so if you don't want kids running in a corridor or slamming doors make sure you ask at the reception to try to allocate you away from family rooms.

There is no currency exchange (except for Euro to Euro - not sure why you would want to change Euro for Euros?), the menu in the restaurant has a ridiculously limited choice and the food is bland and uninteresting. The service in the restaurant is shockingly bad and noticeably unhelpful. One evening my husband came in for a coffee at 11.30pm after watching Barcelona play Granada at Nou Camp Stadium in the freezing cold. We rang the bell on our table for service and were completed ignored by this older guy who seemed to run the kitchen and bar/coffee area. He served another table who arrived at the same time. When he ignored us, I said \"Excuse me\", he walked away from me, went to the kitchen door, turned around and said \"Cerrado (closed)\" and turned all the lights off!!

The place comes alive at night with families out enjoying the great restaurants that line the road for blocks on end. We came back specifically to the road each of our three nights to eat there. The food is good, typical Catalan / Spanish food. You can sit outside, drink your vino, eat your tapas, savour your meal, watch the familes meet up and hear some lovely street musicians. The hotel is close to the Hop-on Hop-off bus tour stop, you can walk there in about ten minutes. It's also about a ten minute gentle stroll to the nearest metro.

I'm so glad that we did. This area is great- ok a bit rough from the metro to the hotel, but around the corner is a street full of really nice bars and restaurants. I assume most of the people there were locals as there didn't seem to be many hotels in this area. The food and drink was cheap and we had the best paella ever here! The breakfast at the hotel was expensive. But, around the corner was a nice patisseria where we bought pastries with different filling for breakfast. This cost less than 2euro. I've read in previous reviews that they we're given 6 bottles of water a day. Well, the recession must have hit as we only had 4. Worst parts of the hotel- the lifts were very unreliable and slow, with one out of two out of order for most of the stay. Another is that our room was not ready at the check in time. Eventually we were given a 'smoking room' but we didn't care ,we were shattered and needed a shower! The room didn't smell of smoking though, which was a relief. 10 minutes away was the most stunning beach ever. We walked along the front every day into town. This took an hour strolling or 90 minutes if you stop for a drink at one of the beach bars, as we did. Much nicer than catching a hot metro. We did catch it twice though, and it was fine. Trains come every 3-4 minutes and you needed to change twice to get to the 'Rambla'. But I'd say with the changes you could be on the 'Rambla' withing 30 minutes of leaving the hotel. We ate at the Port Olympic on the first night. The food was reasonable and the price ok. However we had a drink at a bar there and a pint and a wine was 16euro- compares to 7euro at Poblenou. Nice enough place bud we didn't go back. We went to see what the Rambla was like in the evening and my god, we went back to Poblenou. I have never seen so many people- it was like Wembley stadium had emptied onto the street! It was too crowded for us, but if you like the hustle and bustle, I'm sure u'd love it. Anyway, I'd come back to this hotel if i got another deal on it and will recommend it to other people. Bring your own toiletries though as you only get a cheap bar of soap, shower gel and shampoo.

It's only a few tube stops to the city centre so I personally think you get the best of both worlds by staying here - close to the action AND a good night's sleep. I would recommend getting a Barcelona Travel Card, makes life so much easier and we must have saved a fortune in doing so. You also get discounts to some attractions too.

They have free internet access that is quite fast, the cjeck--in process was quick with no problems at all. It has also easy and quick access to the beach. The downside of staying here is if you are in Barcelona as we were for the very first time, the hotel is really quite far away from the centre although the metro is about a 5 minutes walk away which was great - it is true based on the other reviews that it is very lonely and a walk alone can make one self-concience. Back the the hotel, the only anemities that one gets in the bathroom is a soap, shampoo and shower gel! Full stop! Not what I was expecting for a 4-Star Hotel. The other things to mention is that in the mini-bar there is nothing but the complimnetary water. For the food, should you decide to order room-service I placed an order for a hamburger. It came to me raw and col (it had not defrosted properly). I did ask them to come and replace it which they took away and re-cooked. They did not replace with a fresh one but only re-heated. The bed kept moving and we had tofigure out how to make it stable after various attempts. The breakfast we had only had one day and we thought was ok but over-priced.

It seemed reasonably priced for the amenities offered. However, when you arrive, you notice there is a little photographic trickery.

The nearest metro stop is about a 5 minute walk away (yellow line) which is fine, but the area isn't the best lit at night so might not be advisable for some. The room is fairly spartan with a rather garish (to my taste) colour scheme. Amenities are functional at best. There is a mini bar ('free' water only but with a little room for bought items), but no kettle or iron. The bathroom is equally spartan, a few soaps and gels, and 2 of each size towel. No robes or any of the little travelling kits you sometimes see. The shower is powerful and the hot water hot. Everything was clean and working. The bed continues the rather basic layout. Rather than a double bed, my room had two singles pushed together. The beds were on wheels, and with the hard floor, made it seem a little like a hospital ward. However they were fairly comfortable and spare pillows were provided. Different types of which are available - which seems a little strange for a hotel that voluntarily provides so little of anything else. My main rub was that the horizontal soundproofing between rooms is poor. When lying in bed, you could hear the people in the next room speaking, and if they raised their voices at all (as my neighbours helpfully did a lot), even listen in. They were Germans by the way, and went to bed at 2am. I know this because that was the time I was kept up to till. Breakfast was perfunctory - the usual help yourself fare, and seemed replenished often enough. Plenty of free tables too, so no complaints here. I didn't try the restaurant but if you want generic overpriced Spanish food, there were plenty of places along the Ramblas one street along.

I stayed in suite with a really comfortable bed, it had a little seating area and a lovely flat screen Tv which you could turn to either watching in bed or sitting on the lounge chairs, the bathroom was lovely with a nice shower and jacuzzi bath with a seperate toilet and bidet. There was loads of cupboard space and a fantastic easy to use safe. The room has a fridge which was stocked everyday with 6 free bottles of water which i found handy as there was no vending machine in the Hotel. The room had a great balcony with two sun loungers and a nice view of the Gaudi and also a view of the sea. I wasn't impressed with the Hotel breakfast which cost an extra 15 euro, so we only ate it once. The hotel also does not have a bar that you can sit at in the evening before you go out. We also found our room to be extremely hot but in February they turn off the aircon so you cannot use it. Also whilst in the room around 6 times our electricity would shut off and i had to get the maintenance guy to look at it, in which he flipped the trip switch and asked me if i had anything plugged in? this happened a further 5 times and was a big inconvience and not great if you cant even charge your phone. Saying that i think maybe there was a problem with that particular rooms electrics. All in all though i would say this hotel is great if you want easy access to toursit attractions and access to the beach within walking distance. .", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201crecommended hotel\u201d", "Author": "vt1704", "ReviewID": "UR97231550", "Content": "i stayed in this hotel for 3 nights which was really good.

This is an area in the former industrial part of the city which is presently undergoing a major re-development and renewal. Although much progress has been made since I first visited the region some years ago my impression is that it may be some time yet before the transformation is complete. The locals advised that it was still not safe to venture alone too far from the hotel after dark. The location is really good if you intend to use either buses or Metro Trains otherwise stay nearer the city centre. . On arrival we were issued with two electronic cards which allow access both to the elevator and the room. We immediately discovered that the cards would not operate the lift shaft but the porter kindly used his card to activate the machine. Mind you he didn't offer to assist with the luggage. Needless to say if the card wouldn't activate the elevator it wouldn't operate the room lock either. Back to the reception desk.! If at first you don't succeed... Ole! The replacment cards worked and we returned to our allocated room. Despite the fact that we had specified a non-smoking room both while booking the hotel and again on arrival, as we entered the heavy pungent smell of stale cheap tobacco smoke that greeted us at the door was quite sickening. Once again, back to the reception desk. We were immediately given fresh cards and made our way to a non-smoking room on an entirely \"non-smoking floor\" no less. The room was very basic and to be honest, quite grubby but it was late at night and we were exhausted and so any port in a storm. The price per night was an off season \u20ac109 for weekdays including breakfast (quite reasonable) but leapt to \u20ac202 for weekend nights. The hotel made much-ado about their free internet service but BROADBAND IT IS NOT and unless you've got lots of time and precious little to do, find an Internet cafe and save yourself a lot of bother.The hotel also boast a swimming pool but the glorified bath they are referring to would fail the Trade Descriptions Act on every count. The reception staff are very pleasant however and for the most part speak English. Breakfast is very basic. A word of warning if you opt to walk along the Ramblas. The Spanish love their dogs and keep dogs in great numbers. Despite signs threatening heavy fines for dog owners who do not clear up doggy deposits after their pets, many of the residents ignore the cautions so watch your step. If you enjoy a really good Pizza as you leave the hotel turn immediately right.. On the corner just down from the hotel opposite the Casino (NOT the Tapas Bar next to it) is the best Pizza House in Barcelona. This hotel is trying desperately to give an air of sophistication and has delusions of grandeur but it has a long way to go to reach the standards of some of the finer hotels I have experienced in other parts of Spain. It's trying to box well above it's weight but the promise of the well designed and spacious lobby area as you enter the hotel is not reflected in the rest of the building.

When booking the hotel, I was looking for somewhere central, modern and of good quality, but not too expensive. Finding the hotels in the centre a little too expensive, we decided to stick with the same quality of hotel, but look further out. There are varied reviews of the location of this hotel, but our personal experience was very positive. It's only 5 mins walk (via shops and cafes) to Poblenou metro station and within 10mins, you arrive in the heart of Barcelona. The line takes you either direct to the Barri Gotic (the Gothic Quarter, cathedral, close to the Ramblas) or to the Passeig de Gracia (Casa Batllo/La Pedrera/posh shopping street!) a little further on. A stop for the hop-on, hop-off bus is only 5 mins walk in the opposite direction from the hotel too. We found it to be quite busy during the day (locals rather than tourists) and it felt quite safe at night. Rather than venturing back into the centre in the evening, we ate at local restaurants. They did not have menus in English and we didn't encounter many people who could speak English either, so it's worth taking your phrase book if you don't speak or read Spanish very well. However, the people were friendly and helpful and the prices were much lower than places we had found in the centre during the day. We also found that the quality of the food was better, maybe due to the fact that their trade is with residents of the area rather than transient tourists. There's a good pizza restaurant (El Safareig?) on Carrer del Taulat (3mins from hotel) and a lovely cafe/restaurant (something like Cafe Blu?) on the corner of the same street and the Rambla de Poblenou. Our room was clean and spacious with incredibly comfortable beds. The bathroom was clean, although not particularly well-stocked as regards toiletries. The design is modern and just like in the official hotel photos, so not much comment needed there. It was exactly what we were looking for. Security is excellent, as the life requires the use of the room key. Breakfast was varied and well-stocked. There are computers in the reception area which are free to use, albeit frustratingly slow! The staff were very helpful, particularly the gentleman on reception at night. He helped us to get a taxi to and from the centre after midnight which cost approx 17 Euros (although that was to a club on the other side of Sants train station, so I assume that a taxi to the Ramblas would have been cheaper).

It was quite a relief to get away from the hustle and bustle of the La Rambla. A seven trip ticket for \u20ac7.70 on the metro was quite enough to get us round Barcelona in the three days we were there. The trip on the open top bus is a must. It cost \u20ac21.00 per person and was well worth it and you can catch it just a couple of blocks from the hotel, the Reception will give you directions. There are three routes you can go on but at this time of year the green line is not open. But the blue line and the red line were approx 2 to 2 and a half hours each trip. If you want to hop off at some of the attractions I think you need two days which costs \u20ac27 but if, like us, you just want to use the bus trip to see what attractions are worth going back to see in closer detail, you can then use the metro the next day. The Restaurants round the corner from the hotel are ok but not necessary the cheapest and we found a great restaurant near the Sagrada Familia - Els Porxos. Three course lunch including Sangria for \u20ac11.21.

Everything about the hotel from location, service, room/bath size is true. We took the Aeropuerto bus from the airport to city center/De Catalunya - 5 EURO each. Then took the Metro from De Catalunya, made one transfer and got off at the Lucuna Metro stop -approx 2 1/2 blocks from Metro to the hotel. If you angel slightly left when you exit the Metro this is the shortest walk. Each Metro tkt 1.35 EURO, or you can purchase a T10 Metro pass for 10 EURO good for 10 Metro uses (ticket can be shared with those traveling in your party - this was our choice). While the Metro had steps to contend with and the transfer station had various steps, we managed OK. I would suggest this if you have easy/little luggage to carry or like an adventure like we do. The taxi from the hotel to the pier was 15 EURO, however, with the luggage and pier add-ons we paid 23 EURO's total. We made have paid more since the hotel had to call for a taxi, thus some EURO's already on the meter... FYI - from the pier to the airport the taxi with luggage/port surchages cost 37 EURO, plus tip. The residential area had plenty of restaurants and little shops and we ate our meals outside of the hotel - better value. Ate at \"SunDowner\" for breakfast and was able to get 2 for the price of 1 at the hotel (8.55 EURO for and hotel is 14.99 EURO p.p.) Cuian Mediterranean restaurant at corner of Publonou and ? for approx 23 EURO for a bottle of wine, mussells and Cod in Almond sauce - fabulous! Some fellow cruisers ate at Rawand (sp) restaurant and said great food/value. The Confortel Barcelona is located about 2-3 blocks from the 'Torre Agbar' building which looks like a bullet from the distance. Free use of internet and minibar water a great bonus.

I chose the hotel after reading reviews on here (as I always do).

Its in a quiet neighbourhood as well so no noise in the evenings and it was perfectly safe to walk along the beach and the main street even late at night. We liked the location as its not a very touristy area so you can experience true spanish culture, but you are also only a short metro journey away from all the sights of the city. The hotel itself is clean and very modern, our room was 510 and overlooked the city, with the beach to the left and various famous landmarks to the right, so we had the best of both worlds. The room was spotless and cleaned daily. I particularly liked the 6 complimentary bottles of mineral water we received daily and the fridge we got to store them in. Which is also big enough to store other drinks and snacks. The bed was on wheels so no good if you like to sit up and read a book etc but was big and very comfortable. On the first night we had a drink in the lobby which was okay but it would have been nice to actually have a bar to sit in rather than out in the lobby. We logged onto the Wi-Fi since we have a laptop with us and although the signal is weaker in the rooms and not very fast it works well enough for you to send a few emails etc without too many problems. The roof terrace was good though we only dipped our feet in the 'pool' (its pretty tiny but okay for a paddle to cool off) its a pretty good suntrap as well up there. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel since it was 14 euros each, instead we would nip around the corner to the local patisserie for croissants and then eat them on the beach.

Barcelona is becoming one of the fastest developing large cities in Europe and is recognized as a major cruise ship port. This hotel was our choice for a layover based mostly on the price (55 Euros) for a one night stay with a standard queen size room. The hotel is situated east of the city centre about two blocks from the beach in a developing area consisting of mainly older apartment high rises and a block from Rambla de Poblenou. The hotel is very modern and unusual in decor. The rooms are very comfortable with sparse furniture and a spacious bathroom offering a glassed in shower and separate toilet area. The room is bright with a fridge full of free bottled water and small LCD TV featuring many Spanish channels and English channels as well. You must use your room card to activate the elevator and room lighting/airconditioner so make sure you get two cards from the desk. The desk staff were friendly, however, not too helpful for directions. Since we arrived early they stored our suitcases in a secured area until the room was ready after 3:00PM. We did not use the restaurant in the lobby instead elected to walk a block east of the hotel to a nice commercial street with many restaurants and shops. Since the location was away from the tourist area the locals use this area for shopping and dinning. We found the food to be above average and service excellent in this area, well worth a visit especially in the evening when the area comes alive. There is a small pool and sun deck area on the roof, however, it is small and crowed in the evening. Everything is in walking distance including the double decker tourist bus that covers the entire city on the green line where you can change over to the blue line and red line at selected stops. You catch the bus next to McDonalds at the beach area. One or two day passes are available at a reasonable fee. Headphones are used on the bus with several languages offered during the tour. This is a great way to see the city on an open air double decker which allows you to get off at any stop and get back on once you have toured the particular area. Smart concept here. TIP: Make sure you print off the address of this hotel to give to your taxi driver prior to leaving the airport as this hotel appears to be not that well known. The cost from the airport is typically 30 Euros plus tip. The cost to the port for the cruise ships was 15 Euros. We found the taxi drivers spoke almost no english and were blunt. Considering the price and amenities this hotel is a winner. I would estimate that within 2-3 years the area will be re-built making the Rambla de Poblenou a major tourist centre.

TRANSPORTATION: Tip: Rather use the Poblenou metro station as the walk to there is more pleasant through Rambla de Poblenou or Carrier de Maria Aguilo. We used 4 day travel card that costs 19,50. See other options: http://www.tmb.cat/en_US/barcelona/moute/targetes/targetes.jsp. Both the metro train and buses are air conditioned, but the metro stations and tunnels are rather hot so maybe we would have been using more the buses if we'd understood that earlier. SHOPPING: The nearest Spar food store is in the same block in the Rambla corner of Doctor Trueta street and a Mercadona supermarket you can find when you turn left on the Rambla and walk three blocks. It is on the lefthand side on the Rambla corner. The nearest big shopping centre is Glories in the Avinguda Diagonal. You walk there in 15 minutes. DINING: We ate couple of times in the local restaurant Cala Blanca at Doctor Trueta side of the block (calablanca-bcn.es). The food was very fresh, tasty, reasonably priced and the portions are decent. Especially the lunch menu is very good deal. They also provide their menu in english.", "Date": "July 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire", "Title": "\u201cTrue city experience, away from Las Ramblas\u201d", "Author": "LosTigres", "ReviewID": "UR32963364", "Content": "We loved the location of this hotel.

The metro stop is a couples of minutes walk away but we found we could walk to the zoo and Sagrada Familia within 20-30 mins. In my opinion, the hotel caters mainly for corporate travel. The rooms are large, very clean and comfortable and the decor is modern but not very warm. Although free wifi is available, the signal is very weak and was barely usable. The hotel does not offer room service but there is a pizza menu provided by reception should you wish to order. The mini bar is free but only contains water. The swimming pool on the roof is adequate but perhaps not as good as some others we have experienced in Barcelona. All in all, a great stay in a great location just outside of the city centre.

We couldn't afford a nice hotel in the city centre so decided we'd stay a little out from it and have a nicer place to stay for our money and we really were not dissappointed at all. The location of the hotel is great - the area itself is going through some regeneration so yes, there are a few cranes about and the odd building work but this was easily made up for by the lovely street at the back of the hotel. There were several tapas bars and restaurants all serving great (REALLY great!) food and drink and packed full of locals. The staff were very accommodating to us and our total lack of Spanish vocabulary and all the places we went to in the vicinity of the hotel were amazing value for money. On the last night, 4 of us gorged ourselves on tapas and drinks and the total bill was still under \u20ac60. Even with the \u00a3 so weak against the \u20ac at the moment that's a good price for us Brits! The hotel is also located only 5 minutes walk from the beach and you can walk to the Port Olimpic in 25 minutes along the seafront (very pleasant indeed). There is also a Metro station only a few blocks away which then is 5-10 minutes to get right into the centre at Place Catalunya, Las Ramplas or Barceloneta. A taxi from the airport to the hotel was about \u20ac30 and a taxi from the hotel to the centre of the city was \u20ac5-10 depending on where you were going. The hotel itself is very nicely done out, if perhaps a little on the cheap side (think Ikea showroom). We paid about \u00a375 per room per night including breakfast (having got a really great rate through the price comparison on this website) which was EXCELLENT value. The buffet breakfast had a great selection, there was always plenty of space to sit and the fruit was some of the tastiest and freshest I have had anywhere in the world. The rooms were again nicely decorated, very clean and with a great shower but still a little cheap compared to what you would usually expect from a 4 or 5* hotel. As I say, still excellent value though. Pool on the roof was lovely with great views of the city. Staff were a little 'short' on occasion but generally very friendly. The only complaint I would have is the on-going argument I had to have every morning at breakfast to explain to the staff that yes, breakfast was included in my rate only for them to insist it wasn't and my then having to go to reception, have them agree it should be included and the staff in the restaurant to acknowledge this. To do this once would perhaps understandable but every day became a little tiresome... Overall though, I would definitely reccomend this hotel and will probably go back again, for the atmosphere in the streets around the hotel if nothing else!", "Date": "June 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Ireland", "Title": "\u201cHotel Confortel - Clean, Cheap, Spacious Rooms and Pleasant Staff BEWARE OF LAUNDRY SERVICE\u201d", "Author": "lucypaine", "ReviewID": "UR31898219", "Content": "This was my first trip to Barcelona with my partner and young son- nearly 3. We got off at the airport and had to get a taxi to the hotel. The taxi's are on the same side of the road you get off and there is a system for getting the taxi and we had eventually found the end of a huge queue for the taxi. The systems is great though and the queue moved quickly.. The cost to the hotel (print off the full address - The Street address is pretty useful Roman Turro and if you mention La Ramblas Poblo Nou also near Llacunna. It cost 26euro. (30 euro on the way back. The taxi drivers were all really kind and helpful to us and especially kind to my son - helping with the pram and adjusting the seats, seat belts and even providng chid seats sometimes. We arrived early adn the staff let us continue to our room. It is large, clean and spacious. not much of a view but you can see the city or beach not far away. There is a slight smell - hardly noticable - of drainiage around most of the city at times. The beach is a good 10 minutes walk away just behind hte hotel and you can walk to Port Olympic in about 10 minutes where there are many restaurants. We found that teh best place to eat was Flaherty's Irish Pub just off La Ramblas (2nd right on a little square) where sunday dinner is 9euros and there is a happy hour mon - fri. Its great vaule and a good feed. We found the food difficult after a few days and longed proper vegetables, etc. and this was great and cheap with good music, sport and food all rolled in. The Oriental restaurant on La Ramblas served me a spider in my nooodles on one occasion and on another we asked for 2 beer in Casa Joan and it cost 18 euro!!! If you have young children it is best to get a taxi from the hotel as the metro / tube has lots of stairs and is no equiped we found to deal with buggys' etc and little legs! about 10euro will take you to the Colon and bottom of La Ramblas. A taxi back can be got just across from the Colon. The city is gorgeous, it is really expensive, be careful where you eat on the main routes. Go to the Zoo - straight up to the left from the Colon it is about 17euro for an adult and see the dolphin show which is great. Most important bring your walking shoes... I would not recommend a holiday to Barcelona for young children because of all the walking etc, but the hotel itself is lovely, clean and very very respectable. I did not however eat in it. DO NOT GET YOUR LAUNDRY DONE HERE - I GOT AN INCORRECT BILL FOR 122 EURO FOR A FEW CHILDRENS T.SHITS A DRESS AND A SKIRT + 3 PAIRS OF CHILDREN'S PANTS AND A PAIR OF BOXER SHORTS!! Nice small pool and sun deck. Worth the money, however, not really child friendly spot. The little restaurant at the end has lovely staff hwoever, and they love children.

Secondly, we got there, the staff were very nice and friendly, and the hotel looked clean and tidy - the only blip came when they had booked us in a double room instead of a twin, but I can't tell if this was the fault of the hotel, hotels.com or just a blip with their booking form. But 20 minutes later we were switched into another room and the problem solved. So other than that it was all plain sailing for us - the hotel was kept clean and tidy, with the maids cleaning every day (around 10:30) on the first floor. New towels were provided and the mini bar restocked. And true to their word, it was complimentary. So each day we got a diet coke, a coke, 2 water bottles, 2 fizzy water, a light beer, a normal beer and 2 fruit juices. Which is quite handy. The rooms were nice and quiet too. There is supposed to be free Wi-fi but it wasn't working with my psp, but I don't know whether that was down to my PSP or the hotel. But then again there were 3/4 PC's down in the lobby that had free internet access if needed. The pool on the roof isn't huge, but if there's only a couple of people in it, it's good enough to cool down and waste some time in. We spent a bit of time up on the roof in the pool and by the side and it was pleasant. And like the picture shows you can see the sea! Ahh the beach - literally a 5 minute walk in a straight line from the hotel, so I liked it's positioning. If you need to go across town the Metro works well. As for food we didn't use the restaurant but the road that runs down the side of the hotel was filled with cafes and bars that do a coffee and croissant for 2 Euros. Just walk along Ramon Turro heading away from the centre and its the first road you come across. Check out was 12pm and they held our bags for us untill we needed them, and I felt the service was good. But as the heading implies I think the newness is still a minor issue for the hotel - ie they don't tell you the lift doesn't go anywhere unless you swipe your card. If they provided a bit more info it would be great. I think that's the important stuff, overall I would recommend the hotel.", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Confortel Barcelona", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1048732-Reviews-Confortel_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$131 - $371*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Esquina Llacuna, Ramon Turro, 196-198</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">C Eix Llacuna</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08005</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1048732", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/84/9f/ba/front-view-confortel.jpg"}}
