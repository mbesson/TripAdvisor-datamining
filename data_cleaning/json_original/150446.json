It by far exceeded my expectations. The doormen are wonderful, the desk staff is friendly enough but operate somewhat on \"island time\", housekeeping is perfect, and the outdoor and restaurant employees are great as well. There are a few touch ups that could have been made in our room, mainly in the restrooms, but they were spotlessly clean and as a person that has a phobia of hotel beds, I can honestly say I slept well every night. The beds were clean and extremely comfortable. We had a city view on the 8th floor and the view was lovely. I couldn't see spending so much more on an ocean view and I was pleasently surprised when I saw our small balcony (which everyone has) and the city view and beautiful hills in the background. The food is expensive but outstanding in taste and portion sizes. My favorite was Ciao, the beachside grill where you could sit, eat, and enjoy the ocean with your toes in the sand. Mi Casita is right across the street. It has authentic Puerto Rican food, but not huge portions. I would recommend turning right out of the hotel and walking about 5 minutes to Piu Bello, it has great food, low prices, and good portions. Also take advantage of the tour service at the hotel. We did the horse back ride, the tour of El Yunke (sp?), and a day of snorkeling. If you had to chose one I'd chose the snorkeling. It was AMAZING and only $99 a person and that includes a 9 hour day and a buffet lunch on the boat. Oh, and the jet ski rental is extremely fun as well. And lastly the chairs on the beach are padded and extremely comfortable, perfect for napping and tanning. There is so much more I could say but this hotel was wonderful. Just plan on spending money....it IS a vacation after all! :)", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cfirst time to Puerto Rico\u201d", "Author": "Shelleyre", "ReviewID": "UR128451448", "Content": "Quick arrval and departure to airport.

We had a great time. The hotel is very beautiful and conveniently located as well. There are a few things to know though. First, the hotel is a little outdated. For example, the balconies looked really cheesy along with the logo. Also, if you do not pay for a room upgrade, you will get a balcony overlooking the top of the walkway which is not a pretty sight. I believe they call the non-upgraded room the \"Garden View.\" Other than that, the hotel was very clean, quiet, and comfortable. When you check in, they will ask you to put a $500 deposit for incidentals on your credit card. If you are using a debit card, you won't see this money again for at least 3 days. Also, everything in the hotel is SOOOOO expensive. A bagel is like $6.00 so just be prepared. The pool in the hotel is open 24 hrs which is amazing. One night, we spent time outside by the pool with a bottle of Bacardi and were undisturbed by the staff. This is a great hotel for the price. If you have the money, I would recommend El San Juan which is gorgeous and right next door, however, if you want to save a little cash, it's easy just to walk next door. I would definitely stay there again if in Puerto Rico. Also, if you want to be in contact with a GREAT tour guide, this guy is AMAZING. He won't rip you off and is packed with knowledge.

This is the second time I have stayed at the Intercontinental. They have done a very good job over the past 5 years in making this a comfortable upscale hotel. We had rooms 612 and 614 which overlooked the pool and had ocean views. 614 has a king bed and pull out sofa. I really liked the layout of this room. Very comfortable bed. We did not use the pull out so I can speak to its comfort. The pool area was clean and nice as well. Beach chairs could have been more comfortable though. Go to the beach side bar for lunch or drinks even if you do not stay here. The lobby bar is nice as too. Breakfast came with our package and the staff always remembered what we had to drink the day before. They were very friendly and helpful. I would rate this hotel as a close second behind the El San Juan (main tower) although I have not stayed there since they changed the room decor and I am not sure that I will like the newer modern look. If you stay at the Intercontinental, go next door to the El San Juan lobby bar for a drink at the very least. It is a beautiful place to hang out. I am not sure if they still have entertainment Thursday-Saturday but if they do, go check that out too. You can walk up the beach to the Water hotel (to your left as you look at the water-tall white-lit up in blue lights at night) Have appetizers and drinks on the roof top restaurant. We like to walk over to the Ritz for lunch. Walk out on the beach and turn right. You have to turn right on the road where the beach ends then find the access path to the next beach about 3 buildings down on your left. When you reach the beach, you will see the Ritz on your right. If you are on a budget, there is a large grocery store within walking distance - 3 blocks? toward the highway away from the beach. This is a huge store and they sell alcohol, etc.. Ask for directions from the concierge. Puerto Rico has very good upscale restaurants. My favorite is Augusto. The salmon is amazing-my husband likes the steak. Pickayu at the Conrad is also excellent. You need to take a cab to these restaurants. I have heard from friends that Bottles is good as well but I believe that it is farther away. Take a cab to Old San Juan. Visit El Morro Castle, or just walk by to take a look at the kids flying kites on the super green lawn. Stay away from the la perla \"slum\" on the water between the fort and the castle. This is the most dangerous place in Puerto Rico!

Many oceanfront hotels are placed on their site in a perpendicular orientation to the water (no doubt due to the value/availability of ocean fronting property).

There are numerous chain and non-chain restaurant choices located close off-property and across the street from the hotel for those travelers looking for other (and lower priced) options. We did enjoy the swim-up bar at the hotel and splurged on a couple rounds of $18.00 (HUGE) tropical drinks because the ambiance of the pool and bar area was so nice/relaxing.

I didn't have problems with noisy neighbors but I can't add or subtract points for something that's out of the hotel's control. If you're looking for more than the beach Puerto Rico has plenty to offer. We spent our days exploring old San Juan, surfing on the west coast, hiking in El Yunque (the rainforest), relaxing on the beach, tasting the local cuisine and enjoying the nightlife.

The grounds are beautiful and the pool area is awesome. The beach in front of the Intercontinental is the best in Isla Verde. My hotel room was on the 6th floor facing the pool and it was very nice - just what you'd expect of a high end hotel. My view was primarily of trees, however, you can see the ocean and beach off to the sides, in the distance. Unlike some of the other reviews, I didn't think the rooms looked dated, at all. They weren't modern/chic but they weren't trying to be. The balconies cannot accommodate a chair or table. The airplane noise, which I was concerned about when booking this hotel, was not an issue at all. The drinks at the bar were overpriced, weak and expensive. Our room came with the continental breakfast buffet which we found out later did not include the full buffet. There's no way to know what is and isn't included since there's only one buffet and no signage distinguishing the two options. Nor does the waitstaff explain this to you. As a result we ate things that were not in the continental breakfast buffet ($19 vs. $27 for the full buffet) and were charged extra when we received our (check out) bill. After much hassle and negotiation, they agreed to credit us. Since they charge you for the breakfast and then take it off the final bill (that they did explain to us), we didn't realize our mistake until we checked out - 4 days later. Another thing that bothered me is that they charge you a resort fee that doesn't include the beach umbrella rental ($10). It does, however, include the beach chaise lounges. That seemed unreasonable and petty.

Since I booked so many months in advance, I emailed the hotel a couple of days before leaving and got an email confirmation for our reservations. Guess what happened? We got to the hotel at 7 PM, after having flown all day since we are from Montreal, to have them tell us that they were bumping us to another hotel since they had no room for us! I almost flipped, maybe I should have, but they relocated us to a hotel called La Verdanza. We had no choice. I argued with them that we were women traveling on our own and would not go to a property that we had not researched beforehand. They tried to make it look like they were really working for us but I am pretty sure that the cards were dealt in advance. They were telling us that we were being reimbursed so we had nothing to argue about. I book with Priceline because I watch my budget when I travel but I don't mind splurging either. Getting reiumbursed was the least of my problems!! We ended up going to La Verdanza. We had a great meal at their wine and tapas restaurant but the room was another thing. My friend's room would not lock, it was not clean, the shower had mold and so on. We went back to the Intercontinental the next day since they were offering us breakfast and the use of their facilities. Are you guessing how it went down? We were being asked everywhere our room's number. I kept making the joke that we were homeless so they had to call and ask for permission. We were promised things that we had to argue for. I ended up crying with a spa employee since I was so tired from all the hassle! It bares down badly on the Intercontinental chain and Priceline even though Priceline had nothing to do with it. They had overbooked by 14 rooms and singled out Priceline clients even though I had reserved 6 months in advance. One staff member tried to tell me that I reserved too near my departure date.

When we arrived we were given a 12th floor room and the view was just beautiful. It was our 5th or 6th stay in San Juan and this was the best view by far for the money. It was also the most comfortable bed we've ever slept in and we travel constantly around US and some to Europe. The pool area was superb in our opinion. Lots of different places to relax, lay out, read etc...if shade was your desire they had comfortable spots to stake out for the day and simply enjoy the beautiful weather and ocean. Another up side was that even though we've never paid that much for a room (about $477 including their resort tax and the $59 a day \"service\" fee.??...) it was about half of what the properly next door wanted (El San Juan where we have stayed in off season) and the room was almost as nice. Our only complaint was that every evening in the middle of the night a humming started, ran 15-20 seconds then stopped then started again. It was enough to wake you up each time it happened and it happened repeatedly throughout the nights. It was not noticeable during the day but we were out most of the day. It was secondary to the air conditioning hum which was soft and actually seemed to help to go to sleep. We mentioned it upon check out and were given a blank stare by the staff member who helped us. In all fairness we did not mention it during the stay until check out. One other item was that we suggest checking the bil as always when youstravel as the rate charged for our last day, which was a Monday was erroneously listed at the same rate as a week end rate. The check out desk fixed it right away. We particulary enjoyed Alfredo's and the young man who served us. Although the food could not come close to the New Orleans food we have every other week end, it was fine for island food. An excellent tip is on Fri and Sat evening about 8:30 a great event takes place next door at the El San Juan in the lobby...where a live salsa band cranks up and locals come to dance. There is no charge and no cover and it is really one of our favorite things to do there. We we came back to our hotel there was also similar music at the entrace of the casino but not nearly as lively as listening or watching the dancers next door. Only once when we stayed next door was there a spring break event where the hotel had music suitable for early 20's which to us was loud and \"disturbed the peace\" for us. They said it was a one time week end special for the spring breakers. Finally there is a Pueblo grocery 2 blocks away toward the airport area.

Ms. Perez justified that this as an issue of being on an island, relying on reception from the main USA. However, all lobby tvs had clear and perfect reception. Alfredo's breakfasts are way overpriced- $60 for two for a buffet where bread is hard and flies are roaming around the fruit, cheese and cold cuts.

The room was a nice size, had nice d\u00c3\u00a9cor, and a small balcony that looked out on the street below. We went down to the pool/beach area to look around. They guys ordered beers from the bar (around $6 each) and us girls had some bottled water ($3 each). We were hungry so we walked to Chili\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s which was fairly close.

The lighting in the bathroom/foyer area could have been better, too. My sister and I walked around the pool area the next morning to take some pictures and it was very nice.

Everyone we met (other than management discussed below) were extremely nice. Bell men struck up pleasant conversations. Everyone says hello and asks how you are enjoying your stay. Room service is very acommodating. No issues there. But: 1. We had a suite. The bathroom was tiny. The shower was dingy with paint peeling off the ceiling. 2. We had electrical problems and the outlets in the desk or the desk lamp would not work. We had to call maintenance. 3. Old style tube TVs with bad reception. What kind of hotel doesn't have a flat screen these days? Even the ESJ Tower time share building down the block has them. 4. No mini bar and a fridge that I probably had in my college room 25 years ago. 5. I think, but I can't prove, that I got bites from bed bugs. 6. And this really offended me - my parents were staying in a hotel a few buildings down. I wanted them to come over to the pool area and watch our 3 kids so that I can take a swim or get 30 minutes of rest. Management told me I had to pay $80 a day for my parents to visit the pool areal. According to them, new management from an operating company in St. Marten now requires all guests to register for \"liability purposes\" (an explanation that makes no sense) and registration costs $80. Putting aside that hotels owe a greater duty of care to paying guests than people who wander on their property (which is why the explanation makes no sense) why do they need to charge me? The idea of having to pay to allow my parents into the pool area is insane! Look, I don't mind getting nickeled and dimed on vacation. I can overlook the $60 room \"upgrade\" charge, the $22 crappy wi-fi fee, the $20 bucks to rent an umbrella at the beach, per day, and the $10 bucks that you have to tip the umbrella digger guy, the $13 pina colada and the $5.00 cup of iced tea for the kids, and all the other charges but this is my line in the sand. I tried to speak with the manager but she was so obtuse that I just stopped in mid-sentence and walked away in disgust. 7. The Alfredo breakfast buffet - don't get me started. $30 bucks a person (plus or minus) for absolute crap. 2 years ago they had smoked salmon. Not nova or anything that one could get in NYC but passable. They got rid of it. Now it's eggs, pancakes and an assortment of lame cold cuts and cheese. . . . oh and some small pastries. Complete rip off. The PIU restaurant down the block has an awesome Puerto Rican breakfast. You get a good glimpse of the cockfighting rink across the street. 8. Beach was full of seaweed on Sunday and Monday. May have been because it was a federal holiday. I am told that they normally clean it up daily. 9. Don't believe the kids club hype - there isn't one. All kids activities like face painting and 3:00 p.m. movie time that existed 2 years ago are now gone. The kids club, a building called Planet Trekkers, is a small room with a WII, Playstation and some board games. The building is locked and you have to ask one of the bar guys to open it. Then you have to stay with your kids the entire time. That being said; 10. The bar area downstairs is great and they have an awesome $9.99 carib menu. Only draw back is that it took them about an hour to serve us but the manager voluntarily took 25% off the bill. 11. In the interest of objectivity, I am disclosing that I told the checkout guy how I felt. He have me 2 days of free internet. Big deal! 12. Kids loved pool area. Then again, kids love pool at Sesame Place too. 13. The staff (not management) were awesome. All in all, I don't think I'll ever go back there.

If you leave the hotel on foot and turn left at the street, go about 100 yds there is a Starbucks in the next hotel. Our room was opposite the ocean and the view was pedestrian. If you can upgrade to the ocean side it might be worth the extra cost. Our room was fine, clean and pleasantly decorated (as an Intercontinental should be). A few aspects were dated as others have noted (a tube TV for example) and the bathroom was not contemporary. Both are minor but then again you pay serious money.

This was our second time here. We booked on HotWire for 110/night and then upgraded to an ocean view when we checked in for an additional 40/night. I know that the book price at their website is closer to 300/night, which I wouldn't pay for this place. But for the total of 150/night for an ocean view, the value was excellent and I'd highly recommend it. Check-In was quick. However, we did check in fairly late in the evening on a Wednesday and on other days in the mid afternoon I saw lines (especially around the weekends). The room was tastefully decorated. Queen bed, pull out couch, refrigerator, flat screen tv, vanity area outside of the bathroom, for the ladies - a hair dryer in the bathroom, and a small balcony looking at the ocean. When we checked in, they did tell us that the ocean view rooms that we upgraded to were newer/better furnished than the \"city view\" rooms. Glad we upgraded though - the view is worth it. Air conditioner worked very well. There was a bit of a musty smell when the AC was turned down/off, but it's fairly typical of tropical hotels, and no more than we've experienced at other locations in the caribbean. The pool area is very beautiful, and the orchids hanging from the trees are amazing. The pool itself is unheated, and we saw no one swimming (with the exception of a few kids) the entire week we were there. This was a little bit of a disappointment (because the pool is huge with a waterfall and I would have liked to have gone in), BUT you're on the beach so it's hard to complain too much. The hot tub was great - very large and we often slipped down there at night for some relaxation and a cocktail. Pool and hot tub are open 24-hours. There is a towel stand as you walk out into the pool area, and they make you wear colored bands to show that you are a guest member. A mild inconvenience. Near the hotel itself under a deck overhang there was a ping pong table and a foosball table. The beach is the best part, although Isla Verde is on the northern shore and gets a lot of the direct weather and waves from the atlantic, making the swimming a little rougher than the south sides of the island. Chairs are provided free by the hotel, and a staff member is available to cart them out to you. Umbrellas were available as well, but had a fee that was to be charged to the room. We didn't need one so I didn't catch the cost. The beach is a great beach, and you can't go wrong with the Isla Verde area. When we walked up and down the beach you could find locals selling food or ice cream from carts - also very convenient. Ciao Mediterranean, their beach bar/restaurant, was nice. Prices were a little steep, but the food was actually okay. My wife loved their blue cheese burger, and their salads were excellent. Drinks pricey - $6 beers and $10 cocktails, but they can make a mean mojito that shouldn't be missed. Many restaurants and stores nearby. We frequently grabbed water, soda, beer and liquor and brought it back to our room instead of paying the resort prices all the time. For area restaurants, we tried Lupis (mexican - okay food, okay prices), Metropol (local casual cuisine - great food, great prices), Mi Casita (good breakfast, great prices), and Alfredos (in the hotel, great food, little pricey). Many more options in the area as well, including a starbucks in the neighboring El San Juan Hotel and a Bistro for EXCELLENT breakfast just down the road towards the Walgreens. The grocrey store across from the hotel was closed/vacant, so we did the majority of our shopping at Walgreens (carries everything, including food, beer, liquor and wine). The hotel's casino is small, but other than a couple of chances at slots, we weren't big casino people so it didn't bother us. We ate at the lobby bar one night to try out their special dinners for $10 each - not bad food. There is a Avis car rental in the hotel, and the lady (I forget her name) that worked there the entire week was super friendly. We rented a jeep for $70/day, but there were options for as low as $35. The valet service was also great - they were eager to help with anything from hailing a taxi to providing directions. A coffee shop was in the lobby as well, which we didn't notice until the 3rd day - which is too bad because they had great coffee and croissants (as well as several other breakfast options). All in all, it's a nice resort. Prices are very high, but if you blend them with local establishments and a few trips to the store for snacks and beer, it's not so bad. Some parts of the hotel are a little dated, but you could do worse.

The bathroom looked like they had used a wet towel to clean the whole room and no cleaning detergent was used. They moved us to another room that was better but the carpet was still dirty. We were there for a total of 5 nights and on the last night we were awaken by the police arresting someone on our hallway. Obviously the hotel can't control people's behavior but there was blood all over the elevator and dripping down the balcony from the 15th floor the following morning when we were leaving. When we told the front desk person, she seemed uninterested. We will never stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cLovely old hotel right on the beach\u201d", "Author": "metalmomma", "ReviewID": "UR124675038", "Content": "This hotel is located on one of the best beaches in the Carolina area of San Juan Puerto Rico. The hotel has gorgeous grounds, beach bar, lots of lounges with umbrellas surrounding a lagoon like pool with a little \"island\" and waterfall. It is not far from the airport and has a bus stop almost right in front that serves Old San Juan buses that are very inexpensive. Senior rate for a ride is only 35 Cents. Bus 53 takes you right to the bus station in the Old City. You can then take a free trolley from there to the many tourist stops in the Old City. There are a few local restaurants just a few blocks from the hotel. The food in the hotel is ridiculously expensive, so unless you wish to spend your vacation dollars there, take a little walk or go into Old San Juan where you can get some great cuisine for very little money. The rooms are nicely appointed, but the bathroom was pretty small and average for such an expensive place. Beds and linens are the typical Holiday Inn improved bedding--very comfortable and crisp, clean sheets. Ask for a room facing the pool and beach area. We were only at the hotel for one night prior to a southeastern Caribbean cruise. Unfortunately, the hotel is quite a distance from the port area, which is in Old San Juan, so you need to take a $25 dollar or more Taxi ride if you have any luggage, as the buses really are not equipped to handle luggage. Better to stay in Old San Juan if you are taking a cruise. The hotel has a large casino, but we did not gamble, so not sure just how large or nice it is. We ate at a little restaurant almost across from the hotel which was inexpensive and very good. Cannot remember the name, however. The hotel was a nice place to relax and enjoy the beach and pool area, however, even if for a short time. We had extended check-out, so had a bit of time to enjoy the place before our ride to the cruise ship in the afternoon.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Davenport, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel & Location\u201d", "Author": "LaQuanda H", "ReviewID": "UR124599014", "Content": "This was a good hotel and the staff were really friendly.

I stayed for the first time at the Intercontinental in 2010. The beach is very well kept and the porters are there to bring your beach chairs wherever you would like. It was expensive, yes they charge $20 a DAY for internet service, $8 for a bottle of water, and the breakfast buffet cost you $50 at minimum per day (for breakfast!). Given the fact that I loved the beach, and the convenience of being able to walk to the Starbucks next door at the ESJ and down to Pueblo for some room snacks, water, etc., I thought that I was making the best out of it. At the end of this trip, my boyfriend and I purchased their Ambassador Club membership. We were told this includes a free night stay, a free room upgrade and complimnetary water and fruit daily in your room, to use at each participating hotel. We ended up spending more than we hoped with the nickel and dime approach (coffee in the hotel bar was $5 a cup after tip). We did go back last year, 2011 and will NOT GO BACK AGAIN. First, they refused to honor our free night certificate, saying that we didnt book thru the proper office. I spoke to the Ambassador Club rep for booking directly for this reason and was told what I had to do to retrieve the certificate. They would not honor it. They also would not upgrade our room, nor compensate us for the difference. The front desk staff are rude and will make you wait while they ingnore you and continue typing or speaking to another rep. We left the front desk after feeling defeated and went to our room. This started the trip off on a bad footing. We then proceeded to continue to spend $50+ a day for breakfast (you dont have a choice, there isnt another breakfast place). My boyfriend had the full buffett which was about $28ish, while my appetite choose the continental breakfast which was a choice of 3-4 pastries and oatmeal for a whopping $18ish. We continued to head over to Pueblo every couple of days to buy a case of bottled water and snacks for the beach. After this trip, we will NOT go back again.

We went upstairs to find the suite had a city view, and a single king bed for two travelling adults. We went back downstairs and was told this was the upgrade for Ambassador. Not wanting a city view, we declined. The manager did give us one free breakfast, which of course we found on our bill on our departure day. Our fresh fruit and water , part of Ambassador, was 2 apples, one orange, and ONE bottle of water for two people. Not fiji, just the hotel bottle that they give out in the casino. And it was not daily, just the one time. I asked the man who delivered did they really mean to give one bottle of water for two people and he said yes. The pool area was nice, but they were spraying Tilex right next to us while we were in the pool! I don't know if the management changed, but the changes this year were not for the better. I really wanted to relax in the hot tub in the early evening, and I cannot imagine why they could not get this fixed in three days. I had also brought my iPad expecting the internet to be included in the resort fee, they had changed that 4 months before we went. The elevators had problems when we were there as well, and you cannot tell if it is coming, or going up or down, and it closes before you get there.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cAn excellent choice in San Juan\u201d", "Author": "travelfan725", "ReviewID": "UR123223459", "Content": "I stayed at the Intercontinental in San Juan for 4 days in December 2011 and throughly enjoyed the experience. The hotel is well located 10 minutes from the airport and on a beautiful beach. The property, while older, is very well maintained and is full service, with excellent (if expensive) restaurants, and very large pool, and a small casino. The rooms are very comfortable. The hotel is located right next to the El San Juan, one of San Juan's premier nightlife spots which has a much larger casino. And there is an excellent conceriege service booking many tours of other parts of the island. This is not a hotel for those looking for a secluded, very quiet Caribbean vacation. But if you would like to be in the middle of the action, on a lively and beautiful beach, at a full service hotel, you can't go wrong at the Intercontinental. A couple of caveats - the Isla Verde neighborhood, where the hotel is located, offers few nearby restaurant choices outside of the large hotels. However, it is a short cab ride from the old city of San Juan, where restaurants and nightspots abound. It is also very close to the airport, so one occassionally hears jets arriving and departing, particularly from the non-oceanfront rooms. However, this sound is not very noticable, and is almost completely absent at night, when there is little airport traffice. Also, don't expect a Las Vegas style casino. The casino is very small, smaller than the lobby, with about 5 blackjack tables, a bunch of slot machines, and 3 over-crowded poker games (beware non-spanish speakers - not much English spoken on the poker tables). If you want a nicer casino, go next door to the El San Juan. But I think this is a minor quibble, given the hotel's other advantages. All in all, a very nice hotel, with excellent service.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfield, CT", "Title": "\u201cFriendly service and beautiful beach\u201d", "Author": "mimiFairfield_CT", "ReviewID": "UR123173143", "Content": "We found the Intercontinental through Liberty Travel and booked an ocean view room.

I would echo what others have said about the city view rooms. They are seriously outdated, with cheap furniture, old televisions, with a strong smell of bleach and dinged paint and dirty/old tiles. The television service was awful- not a single channel came in clearly (all with the old-fashioned fuzz from tv's of yesteryear). I am honestly surprised that the InterContinental brandname is allowed to be on this resort. Furthermore, our room lacked an alarm clock and a safe. I didn't complain since I was only there for under 24 hours, but I would have complained if I had booked multiple nights. For a hotel to bill itself as a 4-star resort, I would've expected better, hence the poor rating. I would have given it an average rating (3-stars) if it had advertised itself as a 3-star resort. (They even had the 4-star certificate from TripAdvisor on their front desk) I found my stay at the Stellaris Marriot resort & casino to be a better value for a one-night stay. The pool area is gorgeous, though the water is very cold, despite 80+ degree outside temperatures. The pool furniture is nice, but the grounds just need to be spruced up (worn tilework, dirty tables, old outside furniture). The cost for drinks and limited food options at the resort is very high. Just go across the street to Friday's for a cheaper meal, though I'm guessing that the Ruth Chris steakhouse on site lives up to its name. The front desk staff were not the most efficient I've encountered, and I found it kind of off-putting the way she said \"You've booked one night with the Hotwire rate\". It just struck me as odd, as I've used Priceline and Hotwire numerous times before at other hotels and no one has ever said anything. And just one funny aspect about my stay: A can (not a 20 oz. bottle; a can) of Diet Coke was $2 or $3 if I remember correctly. Last, the casino was poor/average and small. There were plenty of slot machines, but only two poker tables that reminded me of a charity poker game set-up in a church basement. The table games were not busy at all.

An added bonus -- the hotel provides towels, table tennis rackets, pails/shovels for the beach, and lots of other activities for kids (incl a playground by the pool). No additional cost, no hidden fees unlike many other resorts.

What I got was a room that was reeking of mold and mildew, so bad that after 5 minutes I could hardly breathe in the room.

This hotel is in bad need of a major facelift, or just change the sign to Holiday Inn, but it would still need some work. I had a friend who was celebrating her 5th anniversary (that is why I was there). They called them the night before and told them they were way overbooked. They put them in a time share complex a couple doors down for a couple of nights. The hotel did \"pay\" for the nights, but it was a total step down. The casino was pretty empty as was most of the restaurants. The pool wasn't that clean. I could hear the people in the room next door discussing where they wanted to go to dinner.

No moldy smell that you could get in other tropical hotels. If you get a room overlooking the Ocean it is simply breathtaking. The Staff is very friendly and helpful. The Pool is clean safe and fun. Food is great at the hotel. It can be pricey but is worth it. The beach is patrolled by hotel staff and is sectioned off for guests only. If you choose to stay at this hotel you will not regret it one bit. I used to stay at the Courtyard Mariott a few blocks away but not anymore.

Instead, we just went back to the pool area where there were always chairs with umbrellas available. The pool was gorgeous and big. The drinks were resort priced, but there is a Pueblo supermarket within walking distance, behind the embassy suites, which we put to good use. We were looking for a nice relaxing trip after a more hectic and adventurous vacation in June. We definitely found it at the Intercontinental. There was never a rush to get anywhere or do anything. At all times of the day there was plenty of space at the bar, beach and pool. However, if you are looking to see San Juan, or Puerto Rico, you should rent a car.

I had stayed in the Dominican Republic a couple months back at an all-inclusive resort and, while I enjoyed my stay for the most part, I was constantly hassled about upgrades and joining the timeshare group. Not the case here. To my surprise the Intercontinental is a very hands-off establishment (some may not like that), but, that said, they are still extremely friendly and cordial when necessary while not creating that feeling of constantly being on top of you. I mean, I'm on vacation, I want to relax and the Intercontinental let me relax! Yes, it's not all-inclusive, but at the price I paid (and I imagine a fairly common deal, especially in off/shoulder seasons) I was happy to try their affordable bar food once (pretty decent mofongo) and sample the nearby restaurants. I even won a little cash at the casino. The pool area is nice (though the hot tub gets crowded, especially late) and while I wish the pool could be \"open\" later (I mean, we hit up all the sights during the day), it essentially was available for swimming for awhile after dusk. I guess this is a common theme at most resorts with pools, not many people seem to use them late... The beach access was great too and the InterContinental arguably gets the best swath of Playa Isla Verde. City view room was just fine, simple and clean, plenty of TV channels (though a older CRT style TV). The bedding was super comfortable - my girlfriend and I might even order the comforter! It would be nice if the hotel had a little store or vending machines (maybe they do, but I couldn't find them on the commonly used floors (ours and the lobby, and the downstairs). It seemed most people walked a few blocks to the Walgreen's - so we did the same. I feel like I have a low standard for giving hotels a 5-star rating in my book, but it all comes down to this for me. I'm simple. Give me clean rooms, a friendly, stress-free attitude, let me be myself and relax, and give me a few things to do after a busy day, especially at a vacation destination like Puerto Rico, (swim, gamble, maybe eat, watch tv) and I'm ok. It's amazing that many hotels come short of this mark! I honestly couldn't have been happier with the Intercontinental.

Please note that this hotel charges $100 per night for \"incidentals\" which they will hold against your credit card until your departure.

My allergies and those of my friends suffered quite a bit because of it. For the most part we kept the balconly door open just to get some fresh air. The room could also use some updating (no flat screen t.v....really?). The grounds including the pool and jacuzzi are very nice. Contrary to other reviews we found the beach to be extrodinary! It's true if you walk past the hotel in the direction of the other hotels it is not as nice (but this is a clear indication of how well they take care of their part of the beach). We did not eat at any of the restaurants because we found them to be way overpriced (breakfast alone could easily run you around $40).

The building is in severe need of remodeling, the rooms are dirty, and there is no trace of the hospitatality you would expect to be greeted with if you have stayed at any other Intercontinental Hotels. Our two day stay (Saturday 10/8/11 to Monday 10/10/11) began with a 25 minute wait in line to check-in. Four front desk staff stood behind their computers while their computer system was inoperable, while allowing the guests trying to check in to simply mill around, without giving anyone a clear indication of how long it might take to get their system back on, or able to even clearly articulate what the problem was. There was no one to greet guests to detail that there may be a wait to check in, or to even encourage a line be formed. There was simply no consideration given to advising guests of the problem and saying what was being done about it. With the computer system finally fixed, we were able to check-in. My wife and I are Priority Club Platinum Members, which entitles us to a free upgrade to the best available room at any Priority Club Hotel. I booked my room through Priority Club, however the Hotel claimed to not have my number on file. No problem, I brought my Platinum Priority Club for that very possibility. The front desk person checking me in didnt seem to know whether or not he was allowed to upgrade me, even though there were suites and high-floor rooms with water views available (which would have been their best available room, and a substantial upgrade over the King Room that I booked). So he brought the Manager, Irene over to facilitate the upgrade. This is where the true colors of this resort really shined through; Irene didn't want to give me any kind of free upgrade! Irene first stated that they don't \"have\" to give me a free upgrade, and that was at their discretion. OK Irene, way to start off on the right foot. I reminded Irene of the terms of the priortity club platinum program, that clearly stipulate that the upgrade is to the best available room. Irene responded by stating that \"We aren't really a Priority Club Hotel, because we are an Intercontinental\". But \"Irene\", I said \"here is the Intercontinental logo right on the back of my Priority Club Platinum card, and over there on the counter is an advertisement for earning Priority Club points while staying here\". Irene's response to that was something about it being Puerto Rico, and no Priority Club benefits apply here. OK so you get the gist: they won't upgrade you even if you are a Platinum Member. Me? They claimed that the best they could do for me was room 724. This room had a semi-view of the pool, and semi-view of the ocean, being that it was about the level of the tops of the palms. OH yeah, and it was directly across from the elevator. The grounds of the hotel are nice, the pool is nothing you can't find elsewhere for cheaper. In my opinion the Hilton Caribe's outdoor area blow it out of the water, at a fraction of the price. The staff elsewhere in the hotel were fair (although don't ask for two towels at the pool, you'll get a scolding). The only problem I had was when I heard a male and female housekeeping staff on my floor complaining to each other about always cleaning up after Gringo's. I guess housekeeping at this hotel just assumes that all Gringos no comprehende Espanol. Our room was dirty from the get go, but it's not like it was the kind of dirty that I could have asked housekeeping to take care of. Our air vents were caked with dust. The corner of the wall behind a night stand seemed to have never been vacumed or dusted, I cant describe to you what I saw with my eyes in this corner of the room. The bathrooms are nothing you won't find at a yet-to-be remodeled Holiday Inn. Small, cramped, and again dirty. The sprinkler heads had a heavy coating of dust hanging from them. The crown molding in the rooms seems to have been installed with gaps between sections of molding, allowing actual mold, and dust to cake these crevices. There was an actual crack running the length of the ceiling in our room from the sliding window to the wall behind the headboard. I mean these are items in the room that can't be cleaned or fixed by housekeeping, they're just indicitive of a hotel that is old, dirty, and in need of a facelift. Checking out? You guessed right, the computer system was down again! I couldn't even get a simple reciept for my stay, until I waited about 45 minutes! During which time, I actually saw that they were displaying a certificate of excellence from TripAdvisor, ironic. Bottom line, don't go here. Pay a little more and go to the El San Juan next door, or stay in the Condado area. This hotel should be stripped of the Intercontinental brand name.

As the three other rooms at the end of the hallway seemed to be all partying together - and the walls clearly being quite thin - I asked for a different room and was given another king-sized room on the third floor. It was much quieter, but lacked a safe in which to store my valuables. After 3 requests over the phone (each was not fulfilled), I finally asked the front desk in-person to have a safe brought to my room (it finally arrived, 3 hours later). The room itself was fine - nothing particularly special, but certainly not a budget hotel room, either. There was clearly some moisture damage around the air conditioning vent, and the bathroom paint was suffering from heaving moisture exposure as well. San Juan is humid, so this is undoubtedly unavoidable, but I was surprised that the InterContinental was as weathered as it is for the price. Paint around the resort was showing its age, and a lot of the metalwork around the place was rusted. The restaurants in the hotel are very expensive, even by Los Angeles, DC, or Boston standards (maybe not NYC standards...). I tried Alfredo's one night and found the service terrible...and I dined there on a Monday evening! The bar and restaurant along the beach was simple, but had decent food, if not a bit overpriced, and good drinks at a reasonable price. The best part about the InterContinental is by far its pool areas - the pool is huge and has several calm alcoves, as well as a water fall, plenty of shaded areas, and nice loungers and umbrellas. There was ample seating by the pool, and the towels they use are very big and fluffy. They seemed to run out of towels quickly, but I appreciated them giving out two to each individual that requested more than one (hence why they probably run out so quickly, but you can't have it both ways I suppose). The beach is quite nice here, albeit a bit busier than further down Isla Verde (toward the Marriott Courtyard)...beach chairs can become scarce, and there really isn't any shaded area on the beach unless you rent a rusty, moldy umbrella for $10 from the resort...and these become scarce as well as the morning turns to afternoon. There seemed to be a lot of families staying at the InterContinental, too, so the beach crowd was a bit noisier than one might hope. Overall, I don't think I'm going to revisit the InterContinental San Juan Resort, but if anyone is looking for a family-friendly pool and beach resort on Isla Verde, it's probably not the worst Isla Verde has too offer. There is a resort fee, and as mentioned before the dining options are VERY expensive, so keep these things in mind before booking. Expect a 3-star experience at 4-star prices and you'll probably be content with your stay here.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cFront Desk Staff Should be Fired\u201d", "Author": "P M", "ReviewID": "UR117830859", "Content": "We had a lovely time at this beautiful hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 until we checked out.

The bad: 1) Clientele not of the caliber I would expect for the Intercontinental. Lots of riff raff and ghetto types. Lower middle class abounded. Could be due to cheaper prices during the off-season making it more affordable. 2) BEWARE: The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd breakfast buffet that is included with many rooms does NOT include tax or tip!!! They jack up the price to $27 per person for the buffet, knowing that most individuals have it \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcincluded\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in their room\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey charge so much so the wait staff gets bigger tips for doing virtually no work. 3) Inconsistent housekeeping. They routinely left out one or two obvious toiletry items, or forgot to replace a towel. Very strange. We had to ask multiple times to get toiletries filled, and sometimes they just ignored our requests. 4) LIARS AT THE FRONT DESK. Ms. Perez is really a piece of work. When we were checking out, we told her that was felt mislead about the breakfast buffet included in our room, as well as the resort fee. Before booking, I called the hotel to ask about how much the resort fee was. They said 14%, which ends up being ~$20/day. Resort fee was actually 16% we found out, and ~$26/day for us. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t insignificant when you have a 10 day stay! Additionally, when we called before booking we asked for all the specifics around the breakfast buffet, and if there were any extra fees. They said NO, and LIED about the fact that tax and tip (~$12/day) were not included. If you add all this up, for our 10 day stay, we paid almost $200 more than expected. When we told Ms. Perez that we felt misled, she first gave this haughty laugh and said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well they [front desk staff] don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like to tell people about [tax and tip not being included for breakfast].\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When we pressed her that she knew there was a problem and hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done anything about it, she got very defensive, and started telling us that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, they told you about both of those things ahead of time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Excuse me, but you were not on the call. She then told us that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The front desk staff are trained every day on the script to use with customers. They know they have to tell you about the tax and tip for breakfast, and they know what the resort fee is.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She basically backtracked and lied. She first told us that the front desk staff don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like to tell people the truth about the extra fees, then DENIED that theyLIED!

The carpet is very worn and old looking. Bathroom is very small. It's hard with us having our kids here. Very old TV (old CRT). The fridge (which is nice to have) is rusted in various parts.

The pool areas are nice. The waterfalls are a nice touch and the kids really like the pool. There are plenty of chairs and umbrellas. Isla Verde beach is right off the property. This was one of the main reasons we booked at this hotel. That being said, we're a bit disappointed with the beach. There's a noticeable amount of trash. As others have said, there is a good amount of grass/seaweed that washes ashore. The water is not what I consider clear, and the color isn't what you see in pictures of the Caribbean. Each wave brings in a lot of sand. It's no where near the type of beach and water you find in places like Provo in the Turks & Caicos islands. Back to the hotel, the staff was great getting us beach chairs. Umbrellas can be rented for $10/day at the beach (free at the pool).

The associate confirmed that we would have a king bed. Our rooms were not ready and they would contact us as soon as they were. Several hours later we were contacted that our rooms were ready. We entered a room that had two beds. We returned to the front desk, explaining that we requested a king bed. That's when the rudeness and uncooperation started. The associate at the desk stated that we never requested a king size bed. I asked her to pull our voucher as it clearly stated that we did. After pulling the voucher she then stated that we were told that we could not have a king size bed when we checked in. I explained that this was not true that we had been confirmed to have a room with a king bed when we arrived. Ms. Perez, the front desk manager, now gets involved. She starts explaining that she was trying to accomodate our request to have adjoining rooms with my sister-in-law and brother-in-law. So I asked why we were on different floors? She had no answer for that. The she said, didn't you have a problem with your credit card? You needed to have two credit cards to cover the hotel charges. I had no problem with my credit card, and was offended by her condescending attitude. I stated that there was no problem when I checked in. She then went to check on the computer. I guess she didn't believe me. After checking she said oh it was another couple whose last name started with the same letter as yours. Then Ms. Perez left. I aksed to speak to her again. She was quite hostile. I simply asked for an explanation as to why we didn't have adjoining rooms or the king size bed. She nastily said I already told you. (Which she had not.) After explaining to Ms. Perez that she did not give an explanation she then proceeded to give me a story that another couple was given the room. This turned out to be a lie. My sister-in-law saw who was staying in the room, and that couple didn't check in until many hours later that same day. It was a frustrating experience all because the front desk didn't know what they were doing. The ineptness apparently started with the front desk manager. It was uncallled for. Instead of just saying.... okay we will take care of this and get you a room with a king size bed, I was called a liar, and then told my credit card was a problem and not once was I treated with respect.

Now my son is older, teenager and he absolutely loved the pool and beach area and so did I. Also the pool bars were great; awesome view and pretty. The rooms are smaller and a bit musty; I faced the city side and also felt the room was pretty damp inside. I do in parts contribute this to the carpets, not ideal for carpets in a place where the floors get wet so much due to travelers utilizing the pool and the rain falls in general in that area. Tile would be much better and sanitary. The mix of guests were another thing; this may have been a 4 star clientele and it was when we arrived in the middle of the week; mostly conference attendees etc but towards the weekend the place got filled up with many guests drinking in the hallways or pool and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the drinks were not purchased at the hotel but brought from outside. Sort of takes it from a higher level and brings it down a notch. Perhaps the rates are too low over the weekend in order to fill this hotel. Just saying that as I work on a hotel so got an idea.

There are some larger balconies on rooms adjacent to the pool area which looked like they would be nice although they might be louder. The room itself was plenty large for the 4 of us, although nothing special. However, we spent very little time in the room! Pool area was beautiful! They had a large swimming area, waterfalls & a huge hot tub. The swim up bar was very busy during lunch hours and hard to get service, but you can always go to the beach bar to get something if that one is too busy. They have a huge bar between the beach and pool with seating on a deck under umbrellas or at tables on the beach. So, you can enjoy drinks/food wherever you prefer. Beach lounge chairs are free and comfy. The beach is absolutely beautiful and perfect for swimming. If you want to rent jet skis you can do that just a short walk down the beach. When on beach, we would take a short walk to La Playita to buy a bucket of beers for MUCH cheaper than the resorts on the beach (when walk out of hotel onto beach, turn right and walk down beach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c go to end where beach dead ends onto a road and hotel is right there on that road). They would actually just pack the beers in ice in a plastic bag so you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to return the bucket. For meals, we would just go to the strip mall across the street to Mi Casito for some good Puerto Rican food for much cheaper than the hotel.

We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any problems, but the area did seem dangerous & you should be careful. If you need any essentials, you could take a right out of the hotel and not far down on the other side of the street, there was a Walgreens. Right near that Walgreens is a Howard Johnsons that has a restaurant in the lobby, Faccio, with the best pizza! We had pork & plantains for toppings and it was great! As other reviewers have said, check-out at the hotel did take a long time but you can do express check-out if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to see your bill. If you want to see your bill, I would suggest doing that earlier that morning just to check and then do express check-out later when you are leaving so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait in line for 20 minutes.

We booked the hotel as our post-cruise accommodation for one night. We got it as part of a flight and hotel package from Expedia for a total of $982 for 2 people. We chose the cheapest room, a cityview double room, but was surprised to see the room they gave us was an oceanview king room. We didn't want to leave! We only stayed here for one night and weren't able to fully utilize the features and amenities of the hotel. So this review may not be as complete as I would want it to be. LOCATION I like the location as it is close to restaurants and shopping centers. However, it is not close to Old San Juan, it was about a $19+ taxi ride. PREMISES The hotel was nicely decorated and clean. There were lots of comfortable chairs and coffee tables in the lobby which was very convenient for us while we waited to get checked in and waited for our tour guide. I like how the hotel area was not too big - easy walk to hotel's facilities. STAFF The bellboys/luggage/porter staff were very nice. They opened the taxi door for us as soon as we arrived and took our luggages from the taxi driver. We got to the hotel around 8am and our room wasn't ready so we had most of luggages checked in with the luggage staff. We had to get stuff from our luggage a few times and they were very happy to take our luggage out and put it back in again. Our room was ready when we arrived from our tour and one of the luggage staff took all our luggages to our room promptly. The front desk staff was nice too, but nothing extraordinary. The lady at the small cafe at the lobby was a little rude. I purchased a can of soda and a donut and she made a face when I gave her the money. I don't know why she did that. I didn't think I needed to tip her for selling me soda and donut over the counter. ROOM We were surprised to see that we were given an oceanview king room (Rm 1620) on the top floor! It was great! The room was clean, though you will see in the knobs that the hotel is a little old. The balcony was very tiny, you can't fit a chair in there. But the view was beautiful! The bathroom was a regular size. A bathrobe and a pair of slippers were provided. There was a fridge that I wouldn't call a minibar because there was nothing in it. The bed was very comfortable. And my husband loved the sofa where he could read his book while I watch TV from the bed. AMENITIES Internet The wi-fi from our room was slow most of the time. There were times that I couldn't even get any signal. My internet connection from my phone was faster. Pool The pool was very nice. The landscaping around it was very nice as well. However, because of the trees surrounding the pool, there were leaves that have fallen on the pool. Beach towels were provided free of charge by the pool. Beach The hotel staff does a great job keeping the beach clean. There weren't a lot of people as well which was great. We were only able to visit 2 beaches in Puerto Rico (Luquillo and I forgot the name of the other) and the beach at the hotel was nicer.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cCommon areas make this Hotel\u201d", "Author": "SPMT", "ReviewID": "UR114834734", "Content": "We just returned from a 4 day stay at the San Juan Intercontinental. The hotel is not new and the rooms show it. The common areas of this hotel are what make it worth the stay. The lobby is very nice and the pool area and beach are just fantastic. The moment you step out the back of the hotel to the pool area, you are amazed by the look and the atmosphere. Beautiful pool with falls, good sized spa, plenty of chairs and bars. Even more amazing is the beach area. The beach is public but it is one of the cleanest beaches I've ever seen and you can walk along it for a good half hour. Hotel: As mentionned, the rooms are tired. The view from the room is nice. There are balconies but they are too small to sit on. There are rooms in the pool area that could be interesting if you like to be close to the pool. We did not try any of the restaurants. There is a casino in the lobby area. Location: The hotel is close to the airport but it is quite a ways from Old San Juan. We took the local bus on several occasions to get around. It takes around one hour to get to Old San Juan which is longer than it would take by taxi, however at a cost of 75 cents compared to around $25, it is well worth it. The buses have AC and are modern. You need the exact change which is a pain. Taxis are way over-priced. They have taxis that are reserved for tourists which is a licence to over-charge. There are much nicer hotels closer to Old San Juan but I doubt that they enjoy as good a location on the beach and they are probably more expensive. Just for the pool and the beach, I would choose this hotel over the more modern hotels. Old San Juan: This is worth a vist or two. The place is packed with stores (many jewelry stores) and restaurants. There are a couple of old forts that are worth visiting. You can take a ferry to the Bacardi plant for a visit. It is a bit complicated, take the ferry (50 cents) from Old San Juan, take a taxi on the other side ($3 each way per person, they are waiting for you when you get to the other side). The vist is interesting (free with 2 free drinks including 8 year old rum) but it is a little long. The visit including getting the ferry and taxis took about 3 hours. Restaurants: There is a wide choice of restaurants and prices are around the same as in a North American city.

The resort and rooms were clean, the staff very helpful and accommodating and a very safe enviroment for the kids. The pool was refreshing (open 24/7) and the beach is right there and clean. Keep in the back of your mind that you can rent cabanas out for the day (24hrs) by the poolside or a beach umbrella (the sun is strong) - they didn't tell us that these were rentable items when we checked in (umbrellas by the pool are free though). I probably would have passed on the room upgrade and picked up the cabana instead. The food & drinks were good to great (depending on the restaurant you went to), prices were on the high side (no bargains here). I recommend hitting up some of the local places for breakfast (all in walking distance) and maybe hitting one or two local places for dinner or shooting down to Old San Juan for dinner. FYI >> There's a small empty frig in the room where you can stock up on drinks and snacks for when you have the late night munchies or for ceral for the kids in the morning. As for sightseeing, stay away from the tour desk in the lobby (unless you want to spend a ton of cash), and go see Nestor (the concierge).

Then I was told there was only one confirmation number so that meant it was only for 1 room. I told him he was wrong. He then told me they needed to get in touch with Hotwire to try to clear this up. Waited about 209 minutes and the clerk told me they were having trouble getting in touch with Hotwire. I then called Hotwire myself and they picked up promptly and I explained the situation to them. While on the phone they put me on hold and 2 minutes later told me the issue has been solved. I went to the front desk and the clerk did then tell me all was corrected. Why could I get in touch with Hotwire quickly but they couldn't? Doesn't make sense. While checking in I bought up being upgraded to ocean view. Told it was 40/night per room. I agreed to it. Was given rooms on the 11th floor. One was ready one was not. Gave me keys to the one that was ready and proceeded up to the room. Much to my surprise when I opened the door I saw 3 kids in the room watching TV. Not sure who was more startled them or me. Now downstairs again to the front desk and explained that the room was occupied. Now they were very apologetic. The desk clerk couldn't have been nicer. Was upgraded to the 16th floor for both rooms, given a 5pm checkout at no cost and 2 free breakfast's. Thought this was very generous of them. Got up to the room and was pleasantly surprised after reading many of the reviews. Room was great!! What a view. King sized bed looking out over the ocean. Bathroom was spotless. The tub is old but fine. GREAT water pressure. AC worked fine. Very pleased with the room. Beach was good. Not sure about the comments about no cushions on the lounges. All lounges had blue cushions. Very comfortable. Pool was nice and warm. Not cold as some have said. Drinks were very good and priced as any other resort. you do have a fridge in the room and could always keep drinks in there and bring them down to the pool. All employees we encountered were nice. No issues with service. Grounds looked great. Very relaxing. No trouble getting lounges on the beach or at the pool. Food was only so so. Beachside grill has sandwiches, wraps and burgers that were pretty good. Alfredo's not so good. Had dinner there one night and was at best fair. Would not go back. Buffet breakfest average at best.

It's not a place I would choose on my own accord. Don't be fooled by the beauty of the seemingly peaceful and beautiful ocean view. That's one of the few things that are worthy at this oceanfront property. Arriving late last night, I go to my room, only to find out that there is water all over the floor in the entry area. I took a few towels and cleaned it up. It was around 1am and I did not feel like changing rooms at this time. I took care of that with the towels, or at least I thought I did. I get into bed and figure I'll watch some tv before I go to sleep. I was looking for the remote and it was no where to be found. After calling the front desk for a remote, the concierge brought me up in one in a very timely fashion. However, when going to door to let him in, I noticed the floor was inundated with water once again. This was not good. I had no choice but to call the front desk and inform them of the situation. The maintenance people came up and advised me that the AC was continuously leaking. I could have traded rooms or slept with no AC. Given that it was now around 230am, I opted to sleep in my room without the AC. I did have a good night sleep though. I did not wake up the next day until the noisy guests in the hall were using profanity loudly amongst eachother. In the morning, I asked the front desk if they could provide me with a complimentary breakfast for my inconvenience of the previous night. They agreed to do that. I then get down to the restaurant, where the breakfast was served until 11:30am. I was told that I had to sit outside because there was a private event inside. No problem. Sitting outside was fine, regardless of the fact that there was not one person in the indoor breakfast area or for the fact that there were throngs of pigeons crowding the nearby tables. I ordered my breakfast from the menu and not the buffet. There was only about 2 other people outside in the breakfast area. My breakfast was a simple egg white omelet with toast. The breakfast took about 45 minutes to arrive. After the first 25 minutes, the waiter informed me that the cook never received the order because the printer was broken. I said ok and just looked forward to getting my breakfast as I was very hungry at this time. A few minutes later, he was nice enough to bring me a plate of fruit while I was waiting. 15 minutes later, when the breakfast does arrive, it was a plate of very watery, undercooked egg whites, with potatoes. The potatoes were good. I guess it's really not that hard to mess up potatoes. I have to also say the coffee and orange juice was good. Upon leaving breakfast, I notice the whole indoor breakfast area was still empty. The special event that I wasn't informed of was probably happening later in the day.

We never had a problem getting chairs at either location and had beautiful weather (we lucked out since May is supposedly their \"rainy season\"). The gym was also nice (small but had all of the necessary equipment and was very well air conditioned). One of the main reasons why we loved the hotel so much was the staff. There were 5 employees that really helped make it a memorable trip for all of us. I recommend looking for the following people if you stay at the hotel: Jimmy (bellman) - Jimmy was the first person we had contact with when we got out of the taxi. He was extremely helpful, especially while venturing to Old San Juan (he reviewed a map with me and even marked all taxi stop locations). Jose (was either giving out chairs/umbrellas at the beach or at the pool cabana) - He was very friendly and accommodating while setting up our umbrella (note that the hotel charges $10 per umbrella). He was great with answering any questions we had and we looked forward to seeing him everyday. Fernando (security guard at beach/pool area) - I can't even begin to say enough about him. Despite working at the crack of dawn, he was extremely pleasant and welcoming. My dad and I talked to him every morning (and pretty much every time we walked by him throughout the day). He really cared about the well-being of the guests (he gave me a tip to soothe my sunburn which worked wonders) and went above and beyond for us. Rafael (chef at Momoyama) - I highly recommend Momoyama. It was one of the best Japenese places I've ever been to. The food was delicious (go for the bisuteki style menu). He was incredible and very entertaining while cooking amazing food. He even let my brother get up and try cooking! Freddie (dealer at the casino) - Freddie was the man! We never wanted to leave his table! In addition to being a very patient dealer, he was very informative about Puerto Rico and where to visit/eat/etc. The Mediterranean Cafe was idea for lunches and had great drinks (we recommend the Voodoo). Just beware of the pigeons/birds - they are relentless! The drinks and food did get expensive but there is a foodstore around the block where you can stock up on snacks/waters/alcohol if you choose.

Asked to speak to Manager, got a lot of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sorry, but we did the best we could \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even gave temporary room.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Still no comp of any kind. Finally asked, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you even give a free drink for this disruption?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Got a free rum punch for each of us (4). Big deal. FYI, I have platinum status with Priority Rewards program, but that meant nothing at this property. Lobby entertainment was boring Thurs and Fri evenings (was not there Sat night, so not sure what happens then.) We were double-charged for one of my two rooms. One room bill was fine. The other room was charged after the first 2 nights of the 4-night stay. After the 4 nights, got another bill under the door for the full 4 nights. Brought this to the attention of the front desk at check out. They said the 2-night statement was just a mistake and the 4-night statement is what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be charged. Not true \u00e2\u20ac\u201c charged the 2 nights and then the 4 nights for the one room. Worst of all was the music being played at the beach bar/restaurant. It was for the large group in house, but it was on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speaker system at the beach, blasting away for all to hear. It was rap music with the most profound language and horrific expressions I ever heard at a family resort (and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m no saint, profanity is in my life, but not shouted in public around families and children as this music was.) I would love to share some of the lyrics with you here to know what the hotel was amplifying, but my post would never make the cut into Trip Adv. Like the last reviewer, we also left the area to avoid the offensive music and general X-rated behavior of the Urban Fiesta group.

The pool was never overly crowded so I find it hard to believe they didn't have a pool view room ready!

The noise from guests getting off the elevator late at night and then first thing in the am from house cleaning meant little sleep.

I chose this hotel for the beach location and boy did I get more than I bargained for. AMAZING!!!! Isla Verde by far has the best beach when you compare them to the Condado or Old San Juan. If it's beach and pool are what you're looking for stay here and just take the bus or a taxi to Old San Juan or the Condado area. I would never take a cab to the beach. Some people complained that there wasn't any night life. Maybe if they would've talked to the staff opposed to looking down on them they would've found out that there is tons to do within minutes of the hotel. You just have to ask. I actually had more fun in Isla Verde opposed to Old San Juan. One of the Old town's bars closed at 11 and the other was Senor Frogs which I do NOT consider a club. Check out \"Q\" and La Placita if you're in your 20's-30s. Club Bravo is an 18 and over club located next door in the El San Juan hotel which had a line that was wrapped around the block....it opens at 10 p.m. If you're older you can enjoy a live band and salsa dancing in the lobby of the IC or the ESJ hotel. Do both in one night....you're on vacation. Restaurant to check out is the Atlantica (google it for the full name). OMG...amazing. The Paella was a little salty but the seafood was extremely amazing.

Check-in was smooth, and after a quick tour of the grounds (pool/spa open all night), and my personal excitement over hearing the coqui frogs, we retired to the most comfortable hotel beds I've experienced in a long time. We opted for the mid-price range \"lagoon view\" room, which just means that you're on the city side of the hotel, but high enough to see the lagoon. (see attached picture - view from balcony). We didn't find the airplane noise to be bothersome, and actually enjoyed watching planes land. The balcony is very small, and would be my only gripe. We like to sit outside and drink our morning coffee when we're vacationing, and that was out. Not a huge deal, as we were up and out to enjoy the day. Loved the large, fluffy bath towels, and the shampoo/lotion/soaps provided had an incredible scent. Oddly enough, there is also a scale in the bathroom - like I really want to know how much I weight while I'm on vacation!! We enjoyed many a delicious breakfast at \"Mi Casita\" in the shopping strip across the street (scrambled eggs, bacon, cheesy potatoes and toast was about $4-5). Actually, we ate lunch and dinners at Mi Casita, too - great food, very reasonably priced/good people - they have delicioius traditional PR/Cuban food - mofongo and asopao, as well as \"American\" staples - hamburgers and pancakes. Also across the street - Baskin Robbins, Subway, Church's Chicken, Burger King, Ponderosa. (The convenience store referenced in other reviews is currently undergoing renovations - not sure if it's going to be a store or not when completed). Our \"special occassion dinner\" was experienced next door at the Old San Juan, at a restaurant called Koco's - delicious and memorable, recommended and arranged by Nestor, the Intercontinental consierge. You can't go wrong with advise from Nestor - find him in the lobby to the left of the front desk. Charming and knowledgeable - he'll take good care of you! Spent a day in Old San Juan - took the local bus there (75 cents/ea - exact change needed) and a taxi back. The bus was safe and air-conditioned and terminated right at Old San Juan after traveling through the neighborhoods. Nestor will outline a walking tour for you and tell you where to find the best restaurants and which trolleys to get on once you're there. We were only there for 3 days, so didn't do any other tours, but spent the rest of our time back at the Intercontinental for pool/beach time. The pool is clean and refreshing, with plenty of chairs, and I was excited to find real size beach towels. Because you receive a wristband, different colors each day, the pool area is kept free of \"passers-through\", and the beach is fairly private. There are some game tables (ping pong, air hockey) in the lobby by the pool, but unfortunately they're only available until 6 pm. If you're traveling with family and can't utilize the casino for entertainment, there isn't much to do in the evenings.

We weren't sure how things were going to go at check in. We got to th hotel around 3pm. The bellmen were very helpful and pleasant. They showed us to the front desk. There were 2 people in front of us and 2 groups came up behind us. Only one person, a man, was working. It took a good 10 minutes for us to get to the front of the line. Once there, the man did his job, but was not overly helpful. He did not answer our questions very thoroughly either. At the beginning of the check in process he told us our room was not ready. Shortly thereafter he told us our room was ready. There was no offer of an upgrade as so many other travelers had mentioned. We didn't care. We just wanted to get out to the beach! We didn't know how the towels worked at this point but found the cabana on the way out. The staff there was willing to answer questions, gave us towels and a security wrist band. We appreciated knowing that people who weren't staying there couldn't use the facilities and others couldn't wander through either. There were plenty of chairs on the beach and in the pool area. We never felt like we had to rush out early to find a place. We were in room 1105. The room itself was fairly small and basic. There was a king size bed, a desk with a chair, 2 nightstands, and a combination dresser/tv stand. Down the hall was the bathroom and a closet. The long hallway from the door past the closet and bathroom to the main space seemed kid of a waste. The furniture was exactly as pictured on line. Both it and the tv are in need of updating, but it was perfectly fine for our needs. The carpet, stone floors and countertops were also showing wear. Yes, the rooms could use a facelift, but they were clean. Housekeeping always came while we were out and made sure everything was replenished or replaced. Our safe worked just fine and we used it every day. We were also glad to have refrigerator. The balconies are super small. We had a mountain view and enjoyed watching the planes land. We live by an airport so none of that bothered us. The only time we noticed was when we were on the balcony or the beach. No big deal! We sat on the floor of the balcony, but I wish they would get a small table and chairs set. It could fit. Part of the package we booked from Cheap Caribbean.com was a 200.00 resort credit. We used it many of the places we could and had money left over at check out. The drinks and food were no more expensive than what is expected in a nice restaurant or resort. The food at the wine bar and Alfredo's was very good. We did not eat at other restaurants on the property. We did eat at the Mexican place down the street. It was ok. We also ate dinner at Mi casita one night. The mofongo was horrible. We did find a liquor store, Mad Dog's down the street. We also found the Pueblo grocery store. Walk to the left out the front of the hotel. Go down to Chili's and walk along the side of the building until you have to turn right. Walk along the back of the building and into the next lot. It is next to a bank. It was cheaper for liquor and had lots of candy choices for souvenirs. The staff was basically very friendly and helpful, especially the women. Some men were a little more dismissive and didn't want to take the time to be helpful. Maria at Avis was extremely friendly and helpful. So was the bell staff. The tour desk would answer basic questions but really wanted to sell tours. At check out there were 3 women working. We had gotten a preliminary bill that night before with preliminaries on it that were wrong. The food charge was applied to the resort credit. There were also 3 days of self parking on the bill. The problem was that we hadn't had a car on 2 of the 3 days they said we parked. 2 days were credited and our bill was corrected. They also gave us advice for bringing shells back. property.

Yes, you will have to pay the resort fee ($17.92 a night). At other hotels, we might have had to pay for chairs on the beach, internet and the fitness center but the resort fee covered this at the Intercontinental. We enjoyed the beach for walking and sunning. The pool is cool but refreshing when it is 90 degrees. We ate at the pool restaurant (excellent burger and salad!) and Momoyama for sushi (great rolls!). Yes, both were expensive compared to eating in Ohio but what I would expect eating at a beach resort. Only issue we had were the people in the next room smoking on their balcony which blew into our room. Security was called and they were asked to stop. I used the fitness center 2 mornings, It was very well appointed and more than adequate for our short stay. We rented a car for 2 days to visit the rain forest (wonderful hike to the top of the mountain!), scuba dive nearby and the bio-bay tour (highlight of our visit to PR). Parking was $16 a day.

Well I was only there for 5 nights so they should had only held $500. I was told the other $400 was a glitch in their system. I then gave them a credit card to post the hold on and to refund me the $900 back to my debit card. By the time I checked out after 5 nights, the funds were never returned into my checking acct.

The front desk told me to charge it to the room each day, I figured maybe we would end up paying but were pleased to find the charges removed upon check out, no hassle. We went to a convenience store to stock the refrigerator in our room with water, beer, fruit and nuts for snacks. This store also had wine and liquor. Head right, cross Isla Verde Avenue turn down the side street and follow the signs towards outback. It was on the left in a building that looked like a white office building. Also the Walgreens across Isla Verde Avenue was handy. The small soft cooler we brought was very useful had no problem bringing it right down to the beach at the hotel. There were few taxes/fees upon check out. We opted for late check out for an addtional $75, if we checked out at 12 our fees would've been probably around $30 which wasn't bad at all. The location is great, on the beach which was beautiful, walking distance to everything, awesome pool/jacuzzi open 24 hours, although a little cold I found it refreshing. We went down to the pool at night as well as during the day which was fun. Lots to do at night, clubs, restaurants etc. The El San Juan next door is a great spot for people watching, check out the lobby. The restaurant right next to the El San Juan (Lupis i think) wasn't very good. We walked the beach to get to some of the nearby spots such as La Playita restaurant (great food, definately stop and see Blake the bartender for a drink he was awesome!) and the Beach and Water Club (had a quick drink, the restaurant is closed except for breakfast and same for the roof top bar) . We felt safe and it seemed quicker and easier than walking on the street. Old San Juan is the place to eat. The forts at Old San Juan are awesome, definately a must see. Rented a car to drive over towards the east coast to visit El Yunque and take a biobay kayak tour, Charlies car rental located across isla verde avenue towards the right was great. We didnt get directions just followed the map and didnt have much of a problem. Not sure if we hiked the La Mina Trail or Big Tree Trail but we ended at a waterfall you could swim in. Water shoes would've been helpful here but still it was nice to wade in. The hike was a workout, slightly difficult in my opinion but well worth it. The Pure Adventure website has very good directions to the marina where biobay trips leave (indicating landmarks because many streets are not marked/no signs). We just showed up there before 5, got something to eat at one of the restaurants near marina and signed up for a tour which left at 6:30, we didnt make a reservation for the kayak trip beforehand and it worked out fine. Around 5 pm all of the tour companies show up at the marina at Los Croabas with trailers of kayaks and pop up tents and set up shop. The only way we knew we were in the right spot at first was the sign for the Captain Suarez boat tour. We could hardly see the glow due to the very full moon at the time of our trip. The tour guides covered our kayaks with a tarp which helped us to see the glow. Great excursion, the kakaking was awesome, also a workout but definately worth it.

We had vouchers and so ate at the Splash Bar for lunch (salads, sandwiches, local fare) and coffee, yogurt, and pastries from the little cafe/wine bar in the lobby for breakfast. Very pleasant. We went out for dinner to a local eatery or into Old San Juan, although the on-site restaurants looked fine. We just wanted a change. The staff at the hotel was lovely, especially the folks at the front desk, concierges, and towel dispensary. Pedro at the Splash Bar was particularly attentive, pleasant, and amusing. After a day hiking in the El Yunque rainforest (somewhat of a disappointment due to the lack of fauna, orienting materials, and signage) and a swim at the much-touted Luquillo Beach, we agreed that nothing could beat the comfort of the Hotel with its beach, pool, and amenties. (We did not partake of the spa and spent just a little time in the well-appointed casino playing slots.) One side trip we would recommend is the Luquillo Kioskos, local food kiosks just outside the Luquillo Beach. While the traditional fried food is plentiful, we tried tapas at the Spanish tavern Tapas 13 which were delicious.", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edgewater, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cThink Twice before booking\u201d", "Author": "Grammeto9", "ReviewID": "UR100312115", "Content": "We have stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel several time and never encountered this problem.

It was generally wonderful -- very nice room, good service, perfect beach. The only annoyance was it took 4 days to get moved from a 2-doubles room to a king-bed room (our travel agent somehow couldn't get this to happen originally). Rooms: Our rooms, city-view on the 8th and then 9th floors, were nice and comfortable, although not luxurious. The only problem we had -- light bulb out -- was fixed within 10 mins of our call. The rooms have mini-fridges, great since resort food is pricey (there's a Pueblo supermarket behind the Chili's, and a Walgreen's nearby, too). The wi-fi was fine for reading e-mail. And room service was prompt the one time we used it. Beach: Just what we wanted -- nice sand, not at all rocky, minimal sea weed, water not too rough. Lots of security, no harassing vendors. Chairs free, umbrellas $10. Pool: Also fine, although not heated. (And the jacuzzi was almost too hot.) None of the chair games we've seen at other resorts. Tour desk very helpful -- we went to El Yunque/Luquillo Beach one day, and snorkeled at Icacos Island another. (Also went into Old San Juan, and visited the Art Museum in Santurce.) Caisno: Small and plain. If you need glitz -- mega-glitz -- go next door to the El San Juan. Between the awesome lobby, and the casino, you will be blown away. (Both casinos good for small-time black jack players, $5 table at Intercontinental, $10 at ESJ.) Food: Pricey. Breakfast buffet is $25 (go across the street to La Casita if you want something in the $5-$8 range). Pizza at the beach is $15-plus (but feeds 2). Fruity drinks in the $9-$10 range. (Better mudslides at beach bar than pool bar.) Ate at Momoyama??? the Japanese place. Food OK, have had better Hibachi at Benihana's. Food alternatives: GO TO KOCO's at the El San Juan next door. It is kind of expensive ($125 for 2) but worth it. Also try Metropol (to the left a few blocks and across the street, by the cockfighting place) for good Cuban food. We also tried Brother Jimmy's? at the ESJ for ribs (so-so) and Lupi's for Mexican (decent) and another 24/7 diner for quick sandwiches, down the street, past Lupi's. Be aware that if you're not dining nearby, you will pay $30-$40 in cab fares to get to other restaurants in Condado or Old San Juan.

First off, we got a great deal that included a free night and full breakfast every day. The breakfast buffet costs $25 per person so this was a great thing to have included. On top of that, we were upgraded for free to on ocean view room on the 7th floor when we checked in (we had booked and payed for a pool/garden view).

The hotel even has a wine bar which was very nice as well. As several other reviewers have mentioned, Isla Verde is not the place to stay if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking to visit OSJ which is why we split our 8 night trip between 2 different places. We rented a car one day and drove to El Yunque and a visit to Luquillo Beach. Although there was a lot of traffic, it was nice to be on our own schedule and it was also less expensive than going on an organized tour. Make sure to visit Nestor, the concierge, who was so helpful arranging or recommending anything. We did the spa one day and the facilities were very nice. There are several great restaurants close by; we actually ate better here than we did in OSJ which, again, surprised me.

It's a borderline scam but everyone is running it these days, so you just have to know in advance. Overall had a good time, mostly thanks to lots of sun and the beach directly behind the hotel.

There is a stand by the pool where you give them your name and room number, and they give you beach towels and a bracelet to know you're with the hotel.

There's a second outdoor bar/restaurant about 50 feet from the first between the pool and beach area. Great place for after sunset drinks and food (closes at 10:00pm). I sat on the beach and soaked up the sun for most of the days. Nice beach. It stretches for a mile and is shared by dozens of hotels. It was clean. The entire beached is raked and cleaned every morning. I had a few nice sunrise walks. Great beach to run along too. Weekends are best for people watching. The rooms are 3-star quality. My room was clean, the maid did a good job of clean-up and new towels everyday. I had a king-sized bed (that was more Queen sized). The bed was just ok. Clean white sheets, 4 white pillows, thin comforter. Air conditioning in the room. My room had a 2-foot balcony with just enough room to stand on. Best thing about the city view are the planes landing. Beautiful eye-level view of every kind of plane landing at the airport. Landing planes aren't noisy, but the ones taking off are. I loved to open up the sliding door and sit by the balcony taking in the heat and watching the planes land. Still, ocean view is better, I imagine. There was a small TV (an old Zenith CRT, not a flat screen) that was set in a cabinet with draws. There is a small refrigerator in the cabinet. The refigerator is empty. I stored water bottles in it (there's a nearby Walgreens).

In terms of looks, the furniture was average---typical hotel furniture if maybe a bit dated. Pastel and white color theme. City noise, thin walls, and a two-hour time difference from Chicago made sleep difficult for me. I could hear the TV and couple's conversations from next door. Occasional police sirens and planes taking off. Recommend an ocean view for the quiet. The bathroom was small, only enough for one person to use at a time. Strangely, there was a small vanity room attached to bathroom where you could sit down and do you makeup. The two rooms should have been combined into one. There are three restaurants attached to the hotel. I ate at two. Alfredo's: Went late to the buffet, around 10:30, and it was a disaster. $25 and all the food had been sitting there for hours. Room temp (cold eggs, cold bacon, cold potatoes, cold pancakes, yuck). The waiter could have said something. There was a huge platter of sliced salmon it and no one seemed to have taken any of it. Tablecloths were stained and messy from birds and pigeons eating food off the outdoor tables. Momoyama was a Japanese restaurant. Had the sushi, saki, and Sapporo. It was a nice restaurant, but the food just ok and pricey. $75 for one person. Didn't try Ruth's Chris. We have one in Chicago. There is every major American fast food restaurant within walking distance (Wendy's, Taco Bell, Subway, Burger King, Church's Chicken, KFC, Long Jong Silvers, and on and on). There's a supermarket right across the street, and and the crucial Walgreen's a ten-minute walk down the street with reasonable prices on everything bu suntan lotion. You can get $0.99 bottles of water from the cooler. There's a Starbucks in the hotel next door to the InterContinental. Didn't go into the casino---it was dark and uninviting. You're just throwing your money away if you gamble in places like this. Go to Vegas if you want to have a good time gambling. There's too much sun outside! Conclusion: if you're a midwesterner like me who wants to get out of the room, escape the winter and soak up some sun on the beach, I can recommend the InterContinental or just about any decent resort in Isla Verdes along the beach. For beach-goers, location trumps amenities every time. Plus, the InternContinental supplies beach towels and easy access to the beach.

The pool water was cold, it's not heated but the jacuzzi was nice & hot and we enjoyed that. There is waiter service at the pool, they do come around to see if you would like to order drinks/lunch. There are two places outside to order food and drinks, one at the pool and one right at the beach. The pool area is very pretty, the beach is nice, but there was a lot of seaweed which did smell foul. Everyday there is a very nice lady, Iris, who sells pretty hand-made jewelry at inexpensive prices right on the beach. She is friendly and is always ready to talk to you. It is a nice hotel, in a great location, with a helpful staff and I would stay here again. The Ruth's Chris steak restaurant is on the property and it was very good, expensive, but we enjoyed dinner there and we did go there again on another evening, sat at the bar and watched football games while enjoying cocktails. Lydia, the barmaid was a big Jets fan and made it lots of fun for us; she was a delight! The concierge recommended a wonderful restaurant in the Condado area, called Budatai, and we LOVED it. It had asian/fusion food, had nice atmosphere, good service and delicious food. I highly recommend it. Budatai is also in a great location to shopping and LaConcha Hotel, which was a very pretty and new hotel. There is a very nice breakfast buffet at the Intercontinental, many selections, hot and cold and fresh fruits. It costs $25 per person. I had a facial in the spa and it was wonderful. It was a 50 minute service, however, she spent well over an hour on my facial and I enjoyed it very much. The showers and locker area were clean and pretty. There is also a hair salon on the premises, near the gift shop. I had my hair blown out two evenings by two different hairdressers and they both did a wonderful job. ($35 for a blow-out) They were very friendly and welcoming. People working at this hotel are very nice including front desk, concierge and housekeeping staff. Our oceanfront room was nice, not exquisite, but it was clean. The hook on the back of the bathroom door was missing and there were no chairs out on the balcony, these were my only complaints. We did have a clock (ipod docking station) and a refrigerator, an extra pillow & blanket, an iron and ironing board in the room. Our bed was very comfortable, I slept great each night. This hotel is conveniently located about 5 minutes from the airport, the taxi ride cost $10. There is the El San Juan hotel right next door with more delicious restaurants, shops and casino. In addition, a few short blocks away is the Ritz Carlton with yet more great restaurants, shops & a fun, busy casino. There are other less expensive restaurants and stores right across the street from the hotel as well.

Nice hotel but not the most elegant in the ICH chain - clean, pretty, convenient. with nice amenities. Beach is lovely and not crowded. Food outside at the poolside bars is adequate (burgers, fries, quesadillas, wraps are fairly priced for resort fare) good drinks. The Japanese restaurant is wonderful, Ruths Chris and Alfredo are other options (didn't go there, or to the other San Juan branches of many NYC restaurants). Hotel staff excellent. Several reasonable restaurants (fast food and not) nearby if you want to avoid the expensive hotel breakfast buffet extravaganza - Starbucks, 2 diner style restaurants, a cute bakery/cafe within a block with eggs, pancakes, etc., and a little mall across the street with normal fast food stuff. Isla Verde is close to the airport but only occasional airplane noise. My only complaint - and it is a biggie for me - is the truly beautiful, elegant pool is NOT heated. It was not a malfunction - this is not a new hotel - and I can't imagine why this upscale chain would not upgrade. PR is sweaterworthy at night this time of the year, the days are still a little short -- the OTHER pool hotels in the area are deliciously heated, we checked! Nobody goes in this pool because it is frigid and took my breath away (and I'm used to cold water ocean swimming!)

We stayed for five nights and had three rooms, tried pretty much every restaurant, bar, and service at the hotel and had not a single disappointing experience. At check in we were comped an ocean front upgrade for one of the rooms. All three of our rooms were on the eighth floor and even the ones with the laguna/city view were perfectly fine. Admittedly we heard some noise from the airport but it was not at all a problem. In fact, with so many of us arriving and departing on different flights, the short distance to the airport was a real bonus! Less than $15 cab fare, including tip...5-10 minutes travel time. Awesome! Yes, the rooms were showing a little age(basic, older tv models) but they were very clean, spacious and nicely appointed and the beds super comfortable. Plenty of hot water and lots of water pressure from the shower. Free Wi-Fi was a plus for those in our group who needed to do a little work. EVERY employee we encountered showed warmth and a desire to please...no attitude or rudeness from anyone, from the front desk to the servers to the housekeepers and valet parkers. LOVED the pool area and the beach. At the pool you will be given wrist bands but I appreciated that as a way to keep the pool and beach area free of non-guests. It was no big deal to grab a wrist band at the towel stand. Beach toys, games and paperbacks were provided for our use free of charge and servers circulated thru the pool area unobtrusively, ready to take food or drink orders for those of us who did not want to move from our cushioned lounge chairs! Isle Verde is such a great little strip with The El San Juan and The Ritz Carlton an easy stroll away if you feel like hob-nobbing at slightly (only slightly) fancier places. Personally, I thought they were a little too frenzied whereas the IC felt homey, relaxing, and welcoming. Several fast food restaurants and a Chili's are within walking distance, as are drug stores and grocery stores. We had need for a doctor one day and the hotel was quite helpful in getting one to come to our room. The concierge gave us great dining and touring tips. Our kids did spend a little time in the casino...perfectly adequate for their needs. At checkout we had a couple of small issues with our final bill and the front desk made the changes right away, with a smile and apologies and without any pushback. The servers in the Japanese restaurant, the wine bar, the beach front bar, and the main restaurant Alfredo's were attentive and delightfully friendly and we were very satisfied with the quality and pricing of the food. Not cheap but not that far off other prices in the area, and the convenience and great service were worth a bit of a premium. Loved all the yummy adult beverages, too! Our grandchild was treated like a princess and the servers at breakfast each morning (very good buffet included in our rate) even remembered her name. She loved \"swimming\" over to the swim up bar in the pool to order a Shirley Temple! Easy 15 minute ride to Old San Juan and a little less to the Condado area. We had a fabulous dinner at Marmalade in Old San Juan and also enjoyed El Yunque rain forest and a side trip to Luquillo Beach (gorgeous!).

We arrived at the San Juan airport around 9:30pm and took a cab directly to the hotel. It is a short ride and cost about $10 or so plus tip. We arrived at the hotel around 10:15 and were checked in at once. Since our original room was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153city view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd we were offered an upgrade to ocean view for $25 per night which we accepted. When we looked out our window the next morning we were glad we opted to spend the extra money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the view was great. The room was on the 10th floor (I think the hotel has 16 total floors) and it was in excellent condition. The furnishings consisted of a nice big bed, a sofa, desk, easy chair and a large TV console that also contained storage and a mini-fridge. The fridge was empty and ready to be stocked with our own supplies. There was a large (36\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or larger) flat screen TV on the console. Just off the entrance door is a dressing area with a nice sized closet which also houses a large digital safe. The bathroom is just off the dressing area with shower/tub combo and sink counter top. The bathroom was well supplied with shampoo, lotion and all the needed items. There was also a coffee maker located in the dressing area. The room had a large sliding door that opened onto a very small balcony. The balcony was large enough to stand on but not big enough for any furniture. The view was of the pool area and grounds and onto the beach and ocean. A fabulous view and well worth the extra $25 a night (the other side of the hotel looks out at the city and airport). The grounds of the hotel are very nice and well landscaped. The pool is very large and has adequate chairs so that it was never a problem to find one. The beach is also very nice, clean smooth sand, nice water and a good walking distance in either direction. The hotel has a nice beach front dining area as well as many dining options inside the main building. We ate a late dinner in the bar upon arrival and the pricing was fair and the food was good. There is also a wine bar at one end of the lobby that in the mornings doubles as a coffee shop with pastries.

The hotel is well located for those that do not have a car rental. There are several dining options within a short walk as well as two Walgreens and a large Publix super market (a little hard to find but worth the effort for the good prices on beer, wine and snacks for the room). One word of caution \u00e2\u20ac\u201c many people have reported that Walgreens is a good place to buy beer and wine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c wrong very wrong as they do not sell either (checked both stores). The area around the hotel seems to be pretty upscale with lots of nice condos and other nice hotels and we always felt safe walking about even at night. We had no problems. We enjoyed an excellent meal down the street to the left of the hotel at a place that was highly recommended to us by a local we met on our flight down. It is called Metropol and serves Cuban food. It was excellent, full of locals (we seemed to be the only tourists there) and the prices are very decent. They also made the best mojito I have ever had!

If you plan to go to Old San Juan, take the bus (either T5 or 53) for seventy five cents each way (make sure you have the correct change). The history there is amazing but don't where heels as there is a lot of walking on cobblestone streets. There is a little cafe/bookstore there called Camille's just up from the taxi rank that serves great food at a great price. We booked with East Wind and went out on a catarmaran one day which was great as my husband and son both like to snorkel. I would definitely recommend renting a car as the tours you book through the travel companies can be really expensive and it is easy to just grab a map and go. Rental cars run around $40-$50 per day but there is no charge to enter the El Yunque rainforest and for the Bacardi Rum Distillery tour, both of which were really enjoyable.

The pool servers were also not pushy, stopping by your chair every 5 sec to see if you wanted a drink, but they were around if needed. One of our favorite things about the hotel was the $8.95 menu that you could get at the lobby bar or poolside. We knew, based on other other Trip Advisor reviews, that we would never be eating at the hotel restaurants (WAY too expensive), but to our surprise when we arrived we say a display for this special menu. I got grilled chicken with rice and beans and a salad with the BEST dressing I've ever tasted -- it was a full meal, perfect portions, and DELICIOUS -- did I mention $8.95! Best meal for the money of our 7 days by far. Rooms were great (ours was King, ocean front balcony, 14th floor), very clean, coffee maker with decent coffee (no coffee service in lobby, but Starbucks at the El San Juan, the hotel next door), mini fridge, and when you sat up in bed you could see the waves and tops of the palm trees out the balcony door. The balcony itself is very small, but perfect for just standing and enjoying. Loved also the colors of the room, very fresh and new feeling. I would say perfect for a couple, but if it's a family or if you're entertaining, you'll want something more. Location is a good jumping off point -- but not a ton that's great outside the hotel. Within walking distance you have Mi Casita across the street - a must try (great breakfasts and food overall), Pueblo a grocery store behind the plaza with Mi Casita (stocked up on some necessities for the mini fridge), and a good taco place/ bar down the street, fun atmosphere -- $1.75 for a great chicken taco! And if you're looking to go out, BRAVA located in the El San Juan hotel next door is the \"hottest club in all of Puerto Rico\". We went on Sat night (ladies free before 11, but guys $20!), however it was a great time and good dancing. The other thing about location is that you'll be easy access to the highways (and only 10 min from the airport). We had a rental car, so this was really important. However, (*IMPORTANT*) parking can be tricky. $22 to valet and $16 in the lot across the street from the hotel. I don't know about you, but that's a ton! Especially since our car was only $20/ day from Alamo. Sooo... street parking. Are talking to a number of police and the hotel concierge, we found that on weekends you can park all day and overnight on Isla Verde (the street right in front of the hotel) for free, however on week days, it's a 1 hour limit (9am-4pm), but still parking overnight is ok (but you have to move by 10am). This worked best for us because we did a lot of things during the day, so were fine to move by 10am. It was mainly tricky bc the front desk staff kept acting like not parking in their lot was a crime, and refused to give us any info. Needless to say, we figured it out, and only had to pay for 1 day of parking (because we chose not to leave the hotel that day). I never felt our car was unsafe on the street. Police are constantly patrolling. So, overall, the best was the room with super comfy bed and great view (ask for a high floor!!), beautiful swimming pool and surrounding area, and great service. Make sure to take advantage of a meeting with the concierge on day 1, they are great and have directions directly from the hotel to ANYWHERE you could want to go. And although the hotel is great, get out and go to Old San Juan and do a rainforest trip. We used Rocaliza and loved them!! Lastly, we used Apple Vacations to book so got a good rate -- like $850 for 7 days, so although it was amazing, we would not have considered it before bc it was so out of our price range.

It looks wonderful in design, color and elegance, and all these qualities are conveyed without the over sophistication and opulence of many high-priced locations. The Intercontinental achieves a comfortable and non-overbearing richness. Next thing you find is the welcoming assistance of the staff at the entrance and reception. They too are attentive to guests without being false or cloying. Finally, the fragrance when you enter the lobby, at check-in and on each floor seems chosen with the same goal...to uplift and enhance your visit in a genuine, identifying manner that makes these places comforting and easygoing despite the proximity to opulence. Speaking of fragrance, the toiletries provided are the best I can recall: a Ginseng and Macadamia line. Enough for first impressions, the same comfortable and caring attention is to be found in the staff at the hotel, at the poolside, in the shops and restaurants throughout the grounds. It is in the bedding and the deckchairs and towels and pretty much everywhere. The one area where the hotel went a bit to upscale for my wife and I was in the availability ofreasonably priced food. Had we been traveling with a child, it might have been oppressive to face a $14 charge for a hamburger, dinner at Momoyama or Ruth's Chris, or Alfredo's. For the 2 of us, the poolside restaurant was a little steep, but close to being worth the price. Same for the lobby bar-and-food service. Luckily, there is a plaza across the street with inexpensive eateries. One disappointment was the Casino, which had discontinued its craps table, had a wait-and-see attitude about activating its roulette table and had limited gaming beyond low-priced slots and Texas Hold 'em Poker.

They are very strick about letting anyone who is not staying at the hotel into the pool area, this is understandable, so if you want to invite company be ready to pay a fee.....well worth it tho.

I was recommended this resort by one of my coworker. I read so many reviews on this resort from this website plus other websites. There were more positive reviews than negative but I was still was a little nervous, I really didnt know what to expect. I must say The people who wrote positive reviews were right on. The resort is beautiful!!! My Boyfriend and I had a wonderful time and we can't wait to go back. We arrived early around 12:30pm on a Saturday. Our room wasnt ready so the clerk at the front desk pre check us in, and they took our phone number and told us they will call us when the room was ready. We was also able to leave our bags with the bellmen until our room was ready. Two hours later they called and told us our room was ready. We had left the resort and was walking around the area so they told us when ever we was ready we can come and get the keys. I was so happy at how smoothly check in went, and when we got to our room it was clean and spacious enough for us. We had the city view and I liked it, because I was so fascinated with the planes landing at the airport. Yes, the resort is close to the airport which was great like maybe 10mins top. You can hear some noise from the airplanes landing and taking off but once the balconey door was closed you really didnt hear it. The bed is so comfortable I slept like a baby every night, and I was never awaken from any noise. The pool and hot tub was great. We utilities both morning and night since it was open 24 hours. We didnt hang out at the beach, since my BF dont like the beach. We just walk on the beach one day that it. The fitness center is really nice, they have all the latest machinces. The gym is facing the ocean so you can look out on the beach while working out. The only negative its really hot in there. The machinces have fans on them, I didnt even notice it. It was my BF who notice the fans on the treadmill and once I put it on it made a big differences. I loved the casino even though I didnt win any big money, but I did win enough to pay for breakfast and dinner for a three days. I'm not a big gambler so playing the slots was fun for me. They have the card tables but that not my thing. The casino was a nice size and the staff was helpful. The only negative some of the waitress/waiter stayed more by the card table offering drinks instead of coming over by the slot area. We went to Mi Casita to eat a couple of times, the food was Ok. Lupis was nasty, and La Playata restuarant was really good. The restaurant is outside facing the ocean, and the staff was really nice. We had room service several days from the criollo menu it was really good, and inexpensive. We took a walking tour of Old San Juan at night. We booked this tour with Debbie from legendsofpr.com it was really nice and fun. It was a two hour tour, and she took us to several different location were we took pictures and heard pirate tales and the history of Puerto Rico. We didnt booked this tour with the hotel we did it before we went to PR. That was the only tour we did, I really want to do the rainforest but I will do that on our next trip. We really just wanted to relax, and doing a whole bunch of tours wasnt on our agenda. We walked the whole strip of Isla Verde morning, noon and night and its really safe. There's police every where patroling the area by foot, bike and car. I like that and we never hesistant going out exploring the area or walking down to walgreen if we need anything. Overall the resort is clean, staff friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean everyday and spacious enough. No bedbug and the beds were really comfortable. The amenities were really great and I tried to use all of them. I booked my trip through travelocity and I didnt have any hidden charges at check out.

I am usually a beach person however the pool area was so nice I found myself wanting to stay there the whole visit.

The beach was great too but we spent our ocean time on a day tour snorkeling which almost did not happen. My only complaint is that the person working at the tours desk did not try and find us a snorkeling tour when the companies they use were booked. If my fiance did not have his lap top and we didn't search for our own tour we would have missed out on the experience. The second place he called has plenty of room for us.

So the main Hotel staff was phenomenal (including the people at the front desk), However, the same can definitely not be said for the casino staff. The Casino staff wasn't particularly friendly towards \"out-of-Towners\"; I guess they mainly cater to the locals who fill the casino so the hotel visitors are second thought. Some dealers were nice and friendly but the supervisor or casino bosses were simply rude and sometimes completely offensive. I first played only blackjack and ran into several discrepancies involving \"mis-communications\" and general mistakes by dealers and supervisors. The head supervisor (man in black suit) was called over a few times, and he was worse than anybody on the floor. (I know this isn't Vegas, but I've played at other casinos in PR (the Ritz or El San Juan) and was shocked by his abrasiveness and general apparent dislike of \"Americans\"). Most casinos value your play, that definitely can't be said for this establishment. I also played some 2-5 no limit hold 'em poker (the only poker game they offer). This game initially ran smooth, but numerous times discrepancies arose that were resolved by whoever screamed or argued best. (in normal casinos, the supervisor steps in and resolves all issues, this was far from the case) The dealers were adequate but they seemed to be left on their own, with no support from the floor (unlike most casinos where the supervisor keeps a close eye on each table; the female supervisor that was watching my game didn't seemed to be very in tuned to poker or the rules). The dynamic of the poker game is nothing like you have ever normally experienced. The \"English only rule\" clearly can't apply; because all the locals speak primarily Spanish. This usually isn't an issue, i have played in several countries where this is the case. However, at times it felt that the \"non-locals\" were at an extreme disadvantage. It seemed the supervisors were pretty close to most of the players, so they didn't seem like they had any interest in reprimanding questionable behavior. There were several times that people were simply showing each other their cards (in the middle of the hand). So poker may not be the best option (unless your are fluent in Spanish and prepared to get involved in an argument). So after a few hours of poker i quit. I figured this could be expected from the poker players, but what was truly surprising was the overall disinterest of the casino supervisors. Even when i went back to playing Caribbean poker or blackjack, the more i played the more i could feel resentment from the floor. (And for any regular who plays at a lot of casinos, they know this is the most bizarre thing ever.... Usually casino staff (especially the higher-ups) do whatever they can to make you feel comfortable and happy (so you keep playing) this was simply not the case.) Overall my wife and I had a great time in the isla verde area; there are plenty of reasonably priced restaurants in walking distance of the hotel and Old San Juan (or Condado) is only a ~$15 cab fare away. (make sure you talk prices before you get in the cab (the valet will help if you want.... each valet spoke perfect English and was very helpful). We ate at the sushi restaurant in the lobby and we both enjoyed it, they had a good lunch time special. There is also a Ruth Chris in the hotel, but we didn't get a chance to go there (I would imagine its pretty similar to any Ruth Chris in the States; which is usually fantastic) We had a wonderful \"mini-vacation\" but the time spent in the casino was unfortunately pretty miserable. My wife and I both ended up winning a decent amount of money; but we still left with this horrible feeling..... which shows that even winning didn't make the horrible attitude and discomfort any better. I recommend staying at the hotel, just avoid the casino for entertainment purposes. There is plenty to do on the island; so save the money and avoid the rude behavior. Go to old San Juan and walk the streets during the day. Also next door at the \"el San Juan Hotel\" they had Salsa dancing in the lobby after 8 pm which was a good time.", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cGlad we only stayed for one night.\u201d", "Author": "k00lj", "ReviewID": "UR70698250", "Content": "On our wedding trip to BVI (Virgin Gorda) we had to stay a night at San Juan as out flight schedule did not allow for a good connection. We booked the Intercontinental in San Juan via Hotwire. We were happy at first as we normally like Intercontinental Hotels, and it was really close to the airport. Our stay was not what we would expect from a Intercontinental hotel at all. We arrived at around 13:00, first we had to wait for half an hour to finally check in, then they did not have any rooms available. They tried to sell us an $80,- upgrade, but no thanks. They completely ignored the fact that we were on our honeymoon and my fianc\u00c3\u00a9e was carrying a wedding dress around. The staff at the check in desk was unfriendly and really ticked me off. The first guy was helping others at the same time he checked us in, blabbing along in Spanish not paying any attention to us. When we asked to speak to a manager it took him forever to find one. The manager was not helpful at all and basically told us, you have to wait as you booked a cheap room. The most annoying thing was that the girl on the next counter had gave out around 4 or 5 rooms already to other customers. It seems they have a profound dislike for people booking though Hotwire. They promised to call us as soon as they would have something ready, but of course they did not. We waited at the hotel bar for 3 or more hours until we finally got a room. The staff at the Bar was friendly though. The room was average, a small bathroom in which I could hardly stand up straight. The AC was very noisy and woke me up in the middle of the night, the bed had some duvet under the sheet, filled with feathers that would annoyingly poke you. At checkout they charged us a $17,- resort fee!, for what?! We did not use any resort amenities and they kept us waiting for half a day.

We were SO pleased with the Intercontinental. We had a clean comfortable room that was serviced at least once (usually twice) per day. We easily found chairs at the pool and beach and getting pool towels was a snap! The restaurant on the beach/at the pool was fantastic and we ate and drank DELICIOUS drinks at some point every day. Intercontinental is perfect because you can walk over to El San Juan which is literally RIGHT next door for nightlife, more exciting restaurants, etc. but then return to a quiet, not-so-packed, more appropriately-priced hotel to relax and rest. I'd like to address some issues raised bout beach hotels in San Juan, and San Juan in general. 1) Yes, there are \"locals\" at the hotels. If being around Puerto Ricans bothers you, why go to Puerto Rico? I would think folks would stay in there own hometowns if people from other cultures are so bothersome. I personally LOVED that fact and felt like I was getting a real experience. Side note: Go to Luquillo Beach to really get some good Puerto Rican food and experience the beach the way the local people do. 2) The Intercontinental and the other beach hotels DO NOT HAVE BEDBUGS!! I got the same bites on my trip. The mosquitoes and sand mites are relentless all over the island. Put on some off and keep it moving! People claiming bedbug bites have been going to the beach, hiking in the El Yunque rainforest, and just walking around the Caribbean...where bug bites will occur. Side note: DEFINITELY do the El Yunque rainforest if you can. It is NOT for the physically challenged though. 3) Again, if cultural differences bother you, stay home. I travel A LOT and personally haven't met many cultures that compare to Westerners in terms of rudeness (and I say that as an honest American myself). Yes, Puerto Rican people have a different interaction style than the people of say Aruba and Jamaica. Yes, you may wait for service in restaurants and the hotel staff may not drop everything and run to your side whenever you call, but you will get served with a smile if you relax, put a smile on yourself, and realize that you are on vacation. 4) Rent a car if you plan on going on tours and such. For example, the tour to the Bacardi factory was at least $50 per person from the hotels, but the Bacardi Factory tour is FREE. You get 2 FREE Bacardi drinks there also. I highly recommend going. The admission to El Yunque is FREE also. Get a car! It will save you tons of money! 5) The restaurants at the beach hotels are expensive as stated in other reviews. But there are plenty of other options in the area. If you live in a big US city though, you will not notice the prices. I will say that these are gourmet restaurants and were certainly delicious. I did pay over $40 for a drink and a pizza at the El San Juan...but it may have been the best Cosmo and pizza I have ever had! 6) Monitor your tips! Any excess money given will be considered a tip unless you say \"I need my change back.\" We made that mistake on more than one occasion. Many places include the tip but if you put extra money, the server will keep it. 7) For all of the hotels, the hotel grounds are better than the rooms. The rooms do need a bit of updating, but they were clean and comfortable and we didn't notice much because we didn't stay in the room except for sleeping at night. All of the Isla Verde hotels seem to spend much more on the pool, lobby, casino, restaurants, etc. than the rooms, which at the end of the day is probably a good idea on their part. 8) The hotel is close to Old San Juan which is a must for architecture, history, souvenirs, local music, art and people and of course...good food! 9) The \"laguna\" view is a view of the street, city and construction. There may be a laguna some miles away. \"Pool/Garden\" view actually faces the ocean but they are on lower floors the view of the ocean is blocked by lush and beautiful foliage by the pool. If you don't want to spring for ocean view, pool/garden view is a good choice. In all, I highly recommend the Intercontinental for families, young singles, older couples, anybody!", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Royal Oak, MI", "Title": "\u201cGood value, nice beach\u201d", "Author": "ReneeCR18", "ReviewID": "UR70394073", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed here for 6 nights in July. We had been worried about the weather, as rain was in the forecast every day, but was assured on here that that is the standard forecast and that it doesn't actually rain that much. We got away with just one truly rainy day so that was nice. Check-in and check-out: Because of our flight time we arrived 3 hours before check-in. Our room wasn't ready so they got our number and said they would call us when the room was ready. We went back at 4 and because of the line didn't get to the desk until 4:30, at which point our room was deemed ready. Check-out was much more pleasant, mostly because the resort fee (that I had been waiting for after reading reviews on here) never appeared. We booked our flight/hotel package through Travelocity, so perhaps it was already included, but it was a nice surprise. Beach and pool: The beach had nice smooth (close to) white sand. Beach chairs are provided by the hotel for free, umbrellas are $10 (probably because someone has to come out and shovel a hole in the sand for it...well worth it for us). We didn't hang out at the pool much, it was fairly crowded even at night, but was nice. Restaurants: I have difficulty finding places to eat in Puerto Rico because I'm a vegetarian, however all but one of the places in the hotel (the bar in the hotel lobby) has numerous vegetarian options, which was appreciated. It is expensive but not outrageous. Ciao is the restaurant just off the beach and has a good drink menu where you get probably a 10-oz drink for $8-9. I recommend GuayaBOOM. They also had pizzas for $12-19 that are big enough to share if no one is extremely hungry. Alfredo's was nice, two entrees, a bottle of (relatively) inexpensive wine, and a shared dessert was $125 with tip. If you want a cheaper option I echo the recommendations for Mi Casita, directly across the street. When we wanted fast food to bring to the beach we would go to Subway next to Mi Casita. We also had 2 very good experiences at Plato's, about an 8-minute walk down Isla Verda Avenue. Room: We paid for an ocean view room, which was completely worth it. The view of the 'city' would be a little depressing from where the hotel is. The balcony was great to have, however it's not big enough for chairs. We would just sit cross-legged on the balcony and enjoy the view. We were next to the elevator but the noise was never bad. Room service was good and on the last night they made an elaborate elephant out of towels, which I got a kick out of. The fridge alternated between off (the plug kept falling out) and too cold (our 2-liter of coke completely froze) but was nice to have. Good selection of movies, we pay-per-viewed one for $12.99 on the one afternoon that it was raining hard. Gym: NOT AIR-CONDITIONED. I had intended to go a few times but after the first time I couldn't take how hot it was. There are vents downstairs at the spa but the gym is on the second level and had no air conditioning. Besides that it was fine and has a nice view of the ocean and individual TVs at the cardio equipment. Car rental: We wanted to play things by ear so we started looking into car rentals the day before we wanted to get one. The Avis desk was standing firm at $69/day for the cheapest option, so we booked through Enterprise online for $50/day and picked it up at El San Juan next door. Not bad for last-minute. Charlie Cars is also just a couple blocks down Isla Verda Avenue, as another option for comparison. Do yourself and get the insurance if you aren't used to Puerto Rican driving. Overall I would recommend, I felt we got a good value for our money (especially without the resort fee).", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chambersburg, PA", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Accommodations; Nice Staff...\u201d", "Author": "McVaugh", "ReviewID": "UR69693633", "Content": "Booked this Hotel for my wife and my summer vacation based on an ad I received as a Priority Club Member.

Now, regarding the in-house restaurants being a bit pricey, it's true; however, we dined at all 3 (Momoyama, Alfredo's and Ruth's Chris) and here's the skinny on our experience. Avoid AIfredo's at all costs as it was horrendous (service and food). Momoyama's was average at best and if your expecting the Tempanyaki Chef to put on a show, you'll be terribly disappointed. In fact, our chef wasn't even Japanese. Now, as to Ruth's Chris, don't miss it! Service was exemplary, food was delicious and the Manager, a Mr. Domingo Rosa Ortiz, is one of the nicest guys on the island who bent over backwards to ensure our dining experience was a memorable one. Lastly, if you don't have a rental car, avoid the .75 bus ride to Old San Juan at all cost. Pay the 19 bucks and take a cab.

If you really want to stay in the heart of San Juan, it might be crowded but full of culture and events and lots of restaurants. But I really wanted a beach weekend away and that's what I got. It all starts with the taxi ride from the airport. When you exit the airport, don't look for a sedan, most of the cabs are large white vans and they will tell you it costs more to get to the Isla Verde area (which is a mile and a half away); be prepare to haggle or at least let them know that you know how much it should cost (that means do you research before you arrive). Once we arrive at the Intercontinental, EVERYONE was pleasant. We booked our flight and hotel together to save some money, but didn't really feel like we got a bad room (as some places do put their third-party booking guests in yucky rooms). We got a room on the 14th floor, in the front (facing the lagoon) in the middle of the hotel (next to the elevator and we heard very minimal traffic). Check-in and check-out were both smooth and easy. Our bed was comfy and plush and the room was nice, but the bathroom looked a little gross. It was a little small, but there was a vanity area next to it in case you needed a mirror while someone was in the bathroom. I believe the hotel was recently renovated, it just didn't look like they put too money into the bathroom. The ceilings in the room and especially the bathroom are a little lower that one might be used to, but the balcony was nice and there was fridge in the room. The pool was great, they have a swim-up bar and you walk through the pool area to get to the beach. What more could you ask for? The have a little restaurant off the beach with drinks and lunch items, but be ware, the pigeon population can be a little crazy. They don't flinch much when you shoo them away, but as long as you don't have food dropping to the floor, you should be OK. Back to Old San Juan-with 75 cents exact change and 45 minutes to spare (30 minutes if it's not rush hour), you can easily get to Old San Juan taking the A5 bus to the last stop. Once you arive, don't bother with the trolley, just walk, but get a street map. With a good pair of sneakers and 20-30 minutes, you can walk to the El Morro fort from the bus station.", "Date": "May 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "south florida", "Title": "\u201cAmazingly friendly service\u201d", "Author": "sfltraveler", "ReviewID": "UR63697332", "Content": "We went for a girls long weekend trip.

All of the hotel staff was very friendly, and went above and beyond to accommodate anything we needed. It was such a nice, relaxing weekend. Some pluses: drinks by the pool (on the pricey side, but were good), service to the beach chairs out on the beach, and walking distance to several good restaurants and nightclubs. Also, you are an easy taxi ride to spend a day in Old San Juan ($19 each way), and about an hour to El Yunque rainforest. I highly recommend renting a car for a day and making that trip. Swimming in the waterfall is an amazing (albeit cold!) experience. You can rent a car at the hotel from Avis. You will save money if you go online and rent vs doing it at the counter. Also keep in mind if you rent a car and keep it overnight you will have to pay the parking fee for the hotel...and it wasn't cheap, 20 or 25 a night I believe. The only hotel restaurant we ate at was the sushi restaurant, and I can say it was so good we went back again!! Also, Platos is a local restaurant within walking distance, go try the lobster mofungo..delish!! There is a small casino, we didn't use it.

We booked our holiday with Virgin Cruises. Tue hotel was generally good and we were happy with the staff service who were plesant and helpful most of the time. However, there are a couple of areas that they need to improve on: 1) Main restaurant - Alfredos. This restaurant's food service was the slowest i have ever experienced. If you ordered two courses then you need to allow at least 45mins for each course to arrive. This is unacceptable and we did complain on a couple of ocassions to the manager who did not apologise or give a reasonable explanation. Plus only a few guests ordered wine by the bottle as the prices are generally far too expensive. 2) Lack of evening entertainment - there's not a lot to do at the hotel after you have finished you meal, so you would expect that the hotel would lay on the regular entertainment for its guests. However, we only say some musicians towards the weekend and nothing for the rest of the week. This is poor. 3) Japanese restaurant - as virgin customers, we were \"allowed\" to use our $60pp vouchers on Tuesday nights. We were offered a set menu and the food was generally of a good standard and service was good. However, i felt that the we shoulsd have been able to choose from the normal menu like the other customers. This was annoying as this restaurant was making at least $120 from each couple and the food delivered was not really worth that amount as the courses consisted of salad, soup, stir fry and ice-cream.

We ate dinner downstairs in the italian restaurant and had a fantasatic waiter, better than expected meal, and really reasonable prices. We opted for a city view suite and actually enjoyed the local \"noise\" and music from the street far below, it felt like we were close to everything. I'm sure the pool/beach view rooms and suites would feel more secluded or relaxing, but we were looking for something different on this trip. As with most nearby casino/hotels, the actual casino was small but people were friendly. You can walk to other hotels, which we did, and there were a lot of other quality dining options just one or two hotels away. The only downside to the room was the bathroom. It was small and dated.

Fortunately, it was great. We originally had reserved a room with a city view, but upgraded to an ocean view upon checking in by purchasing their Ambassador card for one year for $150 - which was less than paying for the additional amount of the ocean view room for 4 nights. Plus we get a free night stay at another location within one year. Our room was on the 12th floor with a beautiful view. The balcony is not much, but I just wanted to sleep with the doors open and listen to the waves at night. The room was clean and quiet. Small bathroom, but comfortable bed. No, the rooms are not cheap, but you are on a tropical island right on the beach. The pool was large with plenty of available chairs. The drink and food prices were outrageous - when we got there the first day we were starving and ate at the beach bar: a quesadilla, a salad, and three beers were $50. So later we went to Walgreens and the supermarket and bought our own liquor and snacks and brought them to the pool/beach with us and saved a ton of money. Beach was beautiful with no seaweed and warmer water than the pool. The casino was small, but my husband enjoyed the $10 blackjack table. The doorman, Ray, was great and gave us tips on where to go and how to get there. Took the bus to OSJ for .75 but it was a loooong ride. We didn't eat any meals at the hotel, but ventured out to the many local places within walking distance. Mi Casita was our favorite for breakfast - delicious and inexpensive. Metropol was good, but if you aren't fluent in Spanish, they were not much help with the menu. The El San Juan next door was bigger and fancier, but also louder, pretentious and more crowded. Jimmy's BBQ on the top floor was casual and fun though. All in all, we found the hotel very nice, great location, and the staff was friendly. We didn't have extremely high expectations, so maybe we were pleasantly surprised. Besides, I was on vacation - all I wanted was beautiful weather, a beach chair and a good book.

All three were excellent! We enjoyed great service, delicious food, cocktails and decadent desserts at these three fine restaurants, I hightly recommend them during your stay at PuertoRico. Getting a taxi to leave the hotel was quick and efficient at the front door, I appreciated that. The airport is only five minutes away from Intercontinental so going and coming went without a hitch.

We have grown to love Isla Verde as there is something for everyone - a gorgeous beach, wonderful resorts, Old San Juan culture, great restaurants in the neighborhood, snorkeling, the casinos, great live music, etc. We recently held our destination wedding at the InterContinental San Juan Resort. 135 guests attended, almost all of whom stayed at the hotel. We also had our welcome dinner (which included all of the guests at the hotel). The entire weekend was a complete dream come true. Carlos Ortiz in Catering made both the welcome dinner and our wedding (with a beautiful outdoor ceremony on the beach boardwalk) absolutely incredible. From our very first meeting with Carlos where he set up a wonderful tasting for wedding reception dinner menu, to his assistance coordinating all of the details (along with our wonderful PR wedding coordinator, Milly Centeno). The food was amazing for our welcome dinner as well as the actual wedding. Our guests were blown away. Carlos even promised me perfect weather - and it happened! He thought of so many details - a water station for our guests for the ceremony, a way to light the boardwalk for a sunset/nighttime ceremony, decorating our bridal suite with rose petals and giving us champagne/strawberries - and calling us when we arrived to say, \"Welcome home!\" I had a lot of doubts and logistical concerns about planning a destination wedding, but Carlos and his staff made it wonderful. As for the faciltiies, this resort is located directly on the beach, 5 minutes from the airport. Our guests didn't have to rent cars. The lobby is very nice, simple - with a big, beautiful pool that's open 24 hours (we had a pool party after our welcome dinner at the pool bar). We had an incredibly large room on the 16th floor - the bridal suite, for our use. It was absolutely gorgeous and perfect for hosting a bridesmaid luncheon. The service at the hotel is amazing. From the person who picks up your luggage, to the person handing out towels in the morning, to the wait staff at the welcome dinner and wedding reception, to the staff in the business center, etc., etc. everyone there wants to help and does their best to provide top notch service. Helen Delgado in reservations was extremely helpful in coordinating our guests' rooms. The facilities are absolutely beautiful at the hotel. We had 9 nieces and nephews under the age of 10 who had a complete blast. My sister brought her two infant twin sons and cribs were available for them as well. They loved the pool as well. The beach was perfect for a jog or to play baseball on or frisbee. If you are thinking about a vacation or hosting any kind of event - the InterContinental San Juan Resort is the place to go. Wonderful food, incredible service and amazing attention to detail. We can't wait to go back!!! Our guests are still talking about how much fun they had.

We have always stayed at 5/6-star all-inclusives so we were used to a certain standard. This was our first visit there...and there are no all-inclusives. We wanted to be on the water and felt after reading the reviews on the Intercontinental, it wouldn't be a bad place to stay. When we arrived our rooms weren't ready yet so it was suggested that we take a walk around and grab something to eat / drink at the bar in the pool area. 6 mozarella sticks, 12 chicken strips and 5 cocktails later we were $75 lighter. While we were eating, another guest started talking to us and told us that he never eats at the hotel because it's over-priced...as we just found out. We found a diner across the street and had breakfast for $2.99 every morning and it was great. One morning we wanted coffee at the hotel and four 12-oz coffees was $16. The free coffee that is available in the lobby is removed at 6:30am so that coffee can be purchased at one of the hotel restaurants. 6:30am seems a bit early to remove the coffee. All of our meals were eaten away from the hotel. The hamburgers at the hotel start at $14. We opted to not have our rooms cleaned every day since it's not earth friendly...but did make arrangements to havce 4 coffee packets in our room each day so we could use the in-room coffee maker. Not one morning were they there...we had to call for them each day. The front desk staff, as well as pool staff, were not friendly. The maids were very friendly and greeted us when we passed them in the halls. The few times we needed to stop at the front desk to ask for something, we did not get a smile or asked how we were...very cold. In Mexico we are made to feel welcome with a smile and warmth. The glass doors throughout the hotel were constantly full of finger prints....and were only cleaned once during the 6 days we were there. They are cleaned several times a day in Mexico. Our first morning there we walked the beach about 7am and it was filthy...food, bottles, cups, napkins, etc., from the night before littered the beach. In Mexico all of this is cleaned up before sun-up so the guests don't see it. The tables around the pool and patio area also had food and drinks from the night before on the tables every morning. I also did not feel as safe at this hotel as I do at the all-inclusives because there is no disignation, such as a wrist band, that distinguishes guests from non-guests. Anybody off of the street can walk into the hotel, order a meal, swim in the pool, etc. With all due respect to non-smokers, we are smokers and were not allowed to smoke anywhere on the grounds except for the beach, therefore the beach was one large ashtray. The people of Puerto Rico, away from the hotel, were warm and friendly...with an easy smile and a \"good morning\".", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cVery Fine\u201d", "Author": "burkeohio", "ReviewID": "UR59020954", "Content": "We spent just one night with a very good Priceline rate pre-cruise.

When we complained to the Virgin rep at the hotel we recieved the reply \"well you could share a starter or desert,most people do\"at that point you know you ain't going to get any satisfaction from the rep.Even some of the American guests at the hotel said Alfreado's was far to expensive.We will not be returning to this hotel and will definately not be booking with Virgin holidays again.", "Date": "March 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cRude staff\u201d", "Author": "eagle7881", "ReviewID": "UR58632146", "Content": "DON'T STAY HERE!!!!

And the pool was very kid-friendly and open at all hours. They also showed a kids movie on the big screen and served the kids popcorn on one of the days that it rained. There was also some sort of kids' program for children that are slightly older. The hotel itself is located right on the beach. The beach is accessible via a private entrance right from the pool area. There are chairs to rent ($4/day) for the beach area. The ocean is not as rough as other parts of san juan because I believe there is some sort of breaker a ways off shore that keeps the waves from being overwhelming.

Virgin replaced the half board accommodation with a voucher system. We got $60 per person for each night which sounds great but belive me, $120 does not go far in Alfredos. For three course and a glass of wine, you have to supplement your vouchers with at least $30 plus gratuity - NOT HALF BOARD. Also, when we complained, the Virgin rep was rubbish, dismissed our and the other 8 couples views. The hotel management were similarly unsympathetic.

I was not happy reading other reviews saying that they had \"Roaches\"! Well I am happy to report we had no roaches in our room on the 7th floor/city view. As we arrived from the airport via taxi ($14) for 4 people, the courtyard drive upto the hotel was very pleasant. Nice waterfall and wonderful foilage. The bellman were more than happy to take our luggage for us while we checked in. Of course the desk offered us the \"Ambassador Club Upgrade\" for $250 US. We declined since we would have an oceanview room on the cruise the whole next week. I asked for a higher floor room and were pleased to have a nice room on the 7th floor city view. Upon coming into the room they have marble floors in the hall and bathroom and carpet in the bedroom area. Nice deck that you can walk out on but not large enough to have seating. Nicely decorated with nice bed linens. It looked as though the carpeting was fairly new. The patio door was a little off track and had a 1/2\" gap at all times even when closed. The room was clean but showing it's age. The circut under the sink was falling apart and hagning down which didn't seem to safe. Overall the rooms are fine just a little smaller than I had hoped and not a 5 star quality. The worst part of the rooms was the thinest of the walls. We could hear the two guys next to us talking as if they were in our own room. We were really shocked. While we checked out the hotel the bellman were supposed to be geting our bags to our rooms. We checking out the beach area and pool and went back up to our rooms to change before dinner but no bags. I called down and they said they would send them up. It took another 20 minutes which is way to long. We showered and changed and walked over across the street to \"Mi Casita\" for dinner. It was fancier than I thought. I was picturing from the reviews more of a mom and pop diner. It was nice with white tableclothes and nicely dressed waiters. Our waiters told us of the \"specials\" which sounded great. We ordered a Seafood Mofungo\" which was good. The bill came and to our dissapointment the special price was $23. The normal seafood mafongo was $15. Oh well lesson learned, ask how much before you order. After dinner we we felt totally comfortable walking around both directions before heading back to the hotel. I wouldn't head off the main road but the main drag is fine. Chain restaurants around hotel include Pizza Hut, Subway, Burger King, Taco Maker and some chicken place that looked fine. With all that said lets get to the outdoor area of the hotel. This is the best part of the resort. The pool area is beautiful. They have a nice bar area with stools in the pool to sit on and have a drink. NIce large hot tub. When we were there it rained the first 2 days but we still enjoyed the hot tub while it rained. The pool was just to cold to swim in. On the 3rd day we were there the sun was out and it was 85 degrees but the pool was still really cold so we didn't swim. The restaurant by the beach is way overpriced for what you get. Like previous reviewers have stated this is rated a 5 star resort so keep in mind the prices of the resort will be higher. We didn't eat at any of the other restaurants on site. The beachfront restaurant service was slow as most in the carribean. The lobby is beautful and is joined by the casino. We went in and spent our $10 and that was it. The bar area is nice and the waitstaff there seemed a little faster. The coffee at this hotel was good but expensive. You could walk next door to the ESJ and use their Starbucks. Overall the hotel is nice but I wouldn't want to stay here a full week. Just to expensive, rooms just average, service slow and the location is better in Condado. You are closer to the airport here & I feel the beaches are nicer here but I would try someplace else to compare. We have did stay at the Courtyard Marriott Isla Verde which is rated a 3 star and honestly felt the rooms were just as nice if not a little nicer, location was just as good and service was equal. The ESJ next door seemed more upscale and has a nice rooftop restarant/banquet area that has great views. Cliental there seemed alot younger.

Just take a left out of the hotel, go right on Calle Diaz Way, follow that around a bend in the road, and there you are. Very convenient for stocking your fridge with fresh fruit, sodas, and other essentials. The market also carries beer and alcoholic beverages. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss dining at the restaurants at the hotel! I had a particularly good plate of spaghetti carbonara at the Italian restaurant on the Lower Lobby level. The restaurant / beach bar has a good selection: pizza, burgers, lamb pita, shrimp skewers, and salads. All good portions (not too big or too small) ranging from US$12 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c22.

The cost is pre-determined, about $20 for 4 people with luggage. Upon arrival to the hotel, we found that only one of our rooms were ready and had to wait for a couple of hours for the other one. The front desk was very accommodating. They offered a temporary room so we could change into swimsuits and use the pool/beach while we waited. Once we had our rooms, we were very pleased. Although we only had a street view from our balcony, the rooms were large and comfortable, with a huge bed, lots of space and had a nice sitting area. I can't say enough about the pool area. It was beautiful. I called my family back home and told them I found paradise!! The pool area was awesome with ample lounge chairs. Every spot is a good spot with good blend of sun and shade. (It was hot hot hot in November, so a little shade was welcome) The pool was the perfect temperature and was large enough to have a little corner of the pool to yourself without bumping into everyone else. There was a waterfall at one end that was a lot of fun to splash around. There is a boardwalk with a bar cafe that separates the pool from the beach. Although the beach isn't the best I've seen, it's still the ocean and loved having the option. There were a few tables of vendors selling jewelry and trinkets, not pushy at all and in fact I had to work my way thru the crowd of people around the tables to take a look for myself. The bad...restaurants were ridiculously expensive. We paid $10 for two cups of coffee to go and the breakfast was around $17 per person. There are a few restaurants in the area, but you mostly need to go to Old San Juan or elsewhere to get much of a variety. A cab ride is around $15-18, although we were able to bargain with the cabbies a little. You can also take a bus for around $1.25. Tip.. there is a large grocery store about 4 blocks from the hotel. We loaded up on soft drinks, snacks and rum to take back to the hotel.

We booked through cheapcaribbean.com and got a 5 day, 4 night special. It included air fare from Philly, PA for a total of less than $900. Great deal! (We are not party-ers. We do not drink or going clubbing. We love a great beach and vacation to relax. We vacation about 4-6 times a year. I am 29 years old, married 7 years and have no kids.) Our direct flight of approx. 3.25 hours took us into the San Juan airport. From there, you can take a taxi. We paid $10 and it was worth it. It took only a few minutes for the taxi ride. The hotel check-in was painless and fast. They were nice enough to upgrade us for FREE to an ocean view room on the 7th floor. We would not have paid the additional $80/night for it, but it is beautiful. Because the hotel sits a bit inland compared to the neighboring hotels, the ocean view is more of the jacuzzi, pool and then the ocean view. The room was very clean. We checked the beds and saw no sign of bed bugs (we have read this several times on this website). In fact, we didn't see one bug in our room the entire trip and we left our balcony door open several times throughout the day. The hotel is on the Atlantic Ocean side of Puerto Rico. We did not realize this until our second day. The pool is beautiful and has a few \"waterfalls\" and different areas to swim. There is a swim up bar (not sure what the prices are since we didn't eat/drink at the hotel). The jacuzzi is large and did not get very crowded. The beach is clean and there are a ton of hotel lounge chairs to use. They had stacks of them. The hotel also has towels to use. You are welcome to take them to your room and get more when you go back down. Yes, there is a bracelet you have to put on - but they will let you put it on a bag or put it on your wrist very loosely and then take it off when you tan. As long as the bracelet is close, it is fine to take it off. The water was a bit cold but nothing terrible for this time of year (my husband didn't agree and said it was freezing, but it IS December!) but there were a ton of waves, approx. 2-5 feet high. There were not many swimmers in the ocean due to the pull of the waves. We ventured out a few times and stayed at waist high waters. We were fine. The water is not Caribbean blue that you see in most Puerto Rico photos. This is found on the other side of the island, about a 45 minute drive south. It is murky and had a lot of seaweed. Back to the hotel room - our air condition was cold and worked great. Unfortunately we could not get the room warm enough without opening the balcony door. Every time we set the air to 80 degrees, the cold air would blow and the room would get colder & colder. We had a hotel employee take a look. He was nice but his English was not great and he did not help. A few times we took showers and the water was not hot enough, even on the hottest setting. The internet is free & fast. ABOUT THE WALLS & NOISE - Yes! There is noise and the walls are quite thin. The first two nights we had loud neighbors who kept us up for over an hour. We didn't get woken up by airplanes but we were on the 7th floor and not too high up. The third night was quiet until the morning when we were awoken by hammering directly above us -- at 7am!!! We waited a bit and then called reception. The noise stopped and we fell back asleep. Then the phone woke us up about 1/2 hour later. Reception was calling to see if the noise stopped. Ugh. Then back to sleep for a bit until drilling started above us. We did not get through an entire night without something waking us up. We took a bus ride into Old San Juan. The bus stop is truly right outside the hotel to the right. It cost 75 cents per person and you MUST have exact change. You can take either A5 or C53 to go into Old San Juan. There was a couple at the bus stop for over 45 minutes before we got there and they said there hadn't been a bus by during that time. Thankfully the bus came within 10 minutes after we got there. This was on a Saturday so the bus schedule may be different during the week. The bus ride into Old San Juan took about 45 minutes. It is the last stop and the bus drops you off at a bus depot. Then you can take a (free) trolley to the forts, shopping, etc. Most are full and you have to wait for one to have room. After a bit of a wait, we were able to get on a trolley. We got off at the first fort. It is incredible! It is a mile or so walk to the next fort. You can get back on the trolley and take it to the next fort but why wait? We walked. We did pay the $3 to get into the second (and bigger) fort. It was very cool! Then another trolley back to the bus depot and a bus back to the hotel. Honestly we had plans of going back into Old San Juan for a meal and more exploring the next day but it wasn't worth the 1.5 hours of being on a bus & the wait between buses. The bus drivers were very nice and helpful. We were able to ask someone on the bus to ask the bus driver in Spanish if he would let us know when we were at our hotel. Our Spanish is shamefully awful. He let us know & we were back safely. Our room had a small fridge (no microwave) and there is a local grocery store within walking distance. It is called Pueblo and is a short 10 minute walk. We bought soda, bread, ham & cheese (to make our own sandwiches) and snacks. It really saved us money. There is also a Taco Bell, Burger King, Baskin Robbins, Wal-Greens, Ponderosa, Chili's, etc. within walking distance. The street is undergoing some construction but it doesn't feel unsafe. Domino's Pizza, Pizza Hut and Papa John's Pizza delivers to the hotel. Each is fairly cheap and fast. They are not allowed into the hotel so you have to pick up your orders outside. If you plan on renting a car, use Charley's Car Rental (not Avis which is inside the hotel). A small car rents for approx. $38 a day. We opted not to do this but all Puerto Rico beaches are public and you can stop anywhere on the coastline to swim. The resort puts out an \"activity\" guide each day. The activities are yoga, power walking, Bingo, movies and other light activities. Nothing much and hardly anything in the evening. The fitness center was rated \"awesome\" by my husband. I didn't go but he lifts daily and was thankfully for the Smith machines. We did stop in to see the casino. We don't go to casinos but this one seemed nice. Small, but nice. We also didn't go to the restaurants that are on-site. Breakfast is $22 per person, per day. We brought granola bars & then ate an early lunch out of the resort. All staff was very helpful. Concierge was also helpful and gave us many maps, ideas of where to eat, etc. Truly helpful. Since we paid less than $900 and probably another $200 while here, I feel it was a great deal. We had a nice time. Not an absolutely perfect time because of the beach water, but a nice time.

We faced inward (didn't want to upgrade and pay more for ocean view) and the views were lovely. Yes, there are some planes, but we didn't find the noise annoying and were never woken up by them. The only time we were woken up was by our neighbors having a bit of a romantic interlude (trying to be polite here) one night. So the walls are pretty thin- consider yourself warned. :) After reading reviews here for months before our arrival, I have to say that we were very pleasantly surprised. I thought that even though the front exterior of the hotel doesn't seem very \"new,\" the pool area and the lobby and the rooms were quite nice. We will definitely return and felt like the deal we got on cheapcaribbean.com was certainly worth paying again. Favorites: very friendly concierge who gave us spa coupons (Nasant, perhaps, was his name?), great front desk, bartenders (particularly Rosie at the swim up bar who made a drink up for me that I drank the entire vacation). Pool and Jacuzzi were great (thanks to the staff for enforcing the rule about no children). Proximity to airport very convenient. Bell staff great for getting taxis and making sure you don't overpay. Dislikes: overpriced on site options for eating. You can't save much by ordering room service, sadly. The breakfast buffet is either $22 for full or $17 for continental. There is an a la carte menu for it but considering that at the time we were there it was roughly $8.50 plus tax for coffee and OJ, you'd end up paying more for one plate of breakfast plus your beverages . Unlike previous poster, however, I found the buffet to be quite adequate. Made to order belgian waffles and omelettes. scrambled eggs, applewood bacon, pork sausage, pancakes, roasted potatoes, organic oatmeal with all the toppings, one hot item that varied depending on day (I saw spinach and egg burritos one day and ham and cheese quesadillas another), a full carb bar of toast/bagels/muffins/croissants, a fruit bar, a bagel set up with capers, smoked salmon, cream cheese, etc., yogurt...and I know I'm forgetting one or two hot buffet items. Plus fresh (not concentrate!) orange juice and strong Puerto Rican coffee. I found that to be quite an adequate range of selections. Dinner prices go up considerably. Alfredo's, the hibachi restaurant, the grill by the beach, swim up bar and Ruth Chris' (recently reopened) are your options for on site dining. we actually ate at the swim up bar several times and in the bar once. Upon advice, we tried Mi Casita and were very happy. Their black bean soup is phenomenal. :) I would highly recommend. Service is slow, but I found it to be the island, not the restaurant. My husband loved the mofongo with the fried pork. We also tried it for breakfast one morning and had a $12 check, plus tip. My bacon and eggs with toast and potatoes was $4.99. Are you kidding? How can you beat that? We found the supermarket previously across the street to be closed and were quite disappointed. It would have definitely saved us some money on this trip. We ventured offsite for my birthday dinner at Budatai in Condado on Ashford. This may have been the best meal of my life. I would very highly recommend trying it. The salmon entree with brown butter bernaise was to.die.for. Right now, the casino is undergoing renovation. There is still plenty to do but be aware that there is a little work going on at one end of the lobby. We found it to not be any sort of effect on our trip whatsoever. We also did a segway tour in Old San Juan that we loved and would recommend. No sign of bed bugs that have been mentioned by previous posters. We ventured next door to the El San Juan to check out their restaurants. While the pool facilities are comparable in my opinion, the inside had a much hipper, boutique feel to it. The Intercontinental is a quieter hotel (at least when we were there!). Since that is what we were looking for, we were very happy.

Loved El Convento hotel in Old San Juan. Go inside to courtyard. Had great sangria and tapas/ very pretty and historic property The culture/people...loved walking paseo del Moro and stopping at Cafe Princessa along the way. Loved how everyone would get dressed up to go out at night. More cosmopolitan than had expected. Great dinner at Di Parma in Condado. Outside with beautiful view of ocean and park Louis, Gucci, Ferragamo all right here for shopping as well Enjoyed drinks at La Concha in Condado and the overall scene in the lobby. Very modern, hip and luxurious (would look into staying there also if returning to P.R) El Yunque rainforest/waterfalls also wonderful. Rented a car for the day. Was an easy drive there and enjoyed hiking the trails for a couple of hours one day The Water Club: another cool place to go for drinks/snack at night/ top floor outside and within walking distance from Intercontinental Did the kayak tour in Fajardo of bay at night. We both enjoyed it and it really is a unique experience. Negatives (few) The hotel although nice, has very little to do at night. I like to tour, relax by the pool/beach during the day and go out at night for a nice dinner/drinks. The lobby bar is small and somewhat outdated. They did have some entertainment at night but we just had one drink and moved on.

When you buy through Cheap Caribbean, they should not add a resort fee at checkout because the resort fee is included. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay for the airport transfers ahead of time, it costs too much. It only costs $10 for a cab and $1 per bag. We had 2 bags so only cost $12 for both of us. I was disappointed that we did not get an upgrade to a partial ocean/pool view room because of my Priority Club membership. The GM, Sharon Kilmartin and the front office manager, David Mejia could show better loyalty to returning customers. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the discount through Cheap Caribbean played a role. But if the hotels are going to wholesale these rooms out, they should NOT take that out on the customer! We are Platinum Level Members and got no recognition from the resort, whatsoever. When I asked about an upgrade and mentioned that we are Platinum Level, I was told we could get an Executive Club Room for an extra $30 per night ($120) or we could get the same upgrade by joining the InterContinental Ambassador program for $150 for a year membership. We decided to stick with the Standard Room, which was a very nice room overlooking the street. There was a small refrigerator, which was perfect for us. We went to the little market within walking distance (Pueblo) and got pastries, cereal, snacks, scotch, milk and juice. The grocery store Pueblo is less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel and is open 24 hours with super deals on spirits. We had free internet access the entire stay. The area is safe and close to airport. We did hear planes in the room on occasion, but not very loud. Airport noise never woke us up. The property is gorgeous, the beach is gorgeous and the weather was perfect. We loved all of the lush plants the soothing sound of the little Coqui frogs at the hotel. The spa is out by the beach and is expensive - $70 for half an hour. The fitness center was very nice and faced the ocean. It had all the equipment you could want. The casino was smaller, but it had blackjack, roulette, poker, and craps. Everything you need. This hotel has the nicest pool and beach in the area! The physical facility was VERY well maintained and extremely clean. The sand is soft and clean. You can enjoy the beautiful pool, which is open 24 hours and has waterfalls and many areas to it and the temperature was perfect. There are LOTS of free chairs and umbrellas at the pool and you can rent a fully enclosed cabana too. On the beach, ask the staff for chairs, they are free. The umbrellas there are $10 per day. There are several restaurants in the hotel, Alfredos has fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. Ruth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Steakhouse is on property \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very expensive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our dinner was $114, and we split a steak! Momoyama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is a Japanese steak house where they cook at your table. There is a swim up restaurant at the pool and another restaurant out by the beach. All restaurants on property are very expensive. Plan to spend big money to eat here. I got a can of coke from roomservice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a one dollar tip brought it to $9.46 for one can. The only thing that kept this trip a reasonable price was the trip to the market. BUT, across the street and within walking distance, there are many restaurants like Chili\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Burger King, Subway, Denney's (DO NOT EXPECT FREE REFILLS on ANY drinks ANYWHERE except Denny's), Taco Maker, Ponderosa Steakhouse (good salad bar), Lupis Mexican Restaurant, La Piu Bello, Barrachina, Plaza de Mercado (restaurant / fruit market), Platos, Baskin Robbins, Church\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chicken. A few blocks to the right are Walgreen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, KFC, Dominos, Pizza Hut, Wendys, and some local restaurants and stores. Go to Don Jose/Edith's restaurant down the street. It is a 24 hour \"Mom & Pop's\" kinda place. Delicious Puerto Rican food at reasonable prices. El Metropol is not expensive and has very good Puerto Rican food. If you want great coconut cheesecake and crab turnovers...go to La Playita. The easiest way to get to La Playita is to go out to the beach and turn right. Walk on the beach and go for an early dinner. Don't go through streets, you will get lost and the cabs charge you an arm & a leg...not worth it. The walk is only 5 minutes. The mofongo there is super. You can also go to Mi Casita across the street from the hotel for the mofongo (an odd but delicious concoction of shrimp, beef or chicken tucked inside a pulverized plantain mound, with a great sauce). Food and service at Mi Casita are sub-par. Next door at El San Juan, their lobby was awesome, including a live salsa band and there is a Starbucks, a Brother Jimmy's Barbecue (on the roof with an amazing view of the area), The Palm (expensive) and a nice pizza place. There is an Outback at the Embassy Suites. There are 2 Walgreens for sunscreen, hair spray, etc....one to the left of the hotel and one to the right. Both are a few blocks away. You absolutely must take the city bus (75 cents) to its terminus next to Old San Juan where you can see the old fort and board a free trolley that goes throughout Old San Juan. The best ride you can get for 75 cents ($20 by cab). In Old San Juan, I recommend eating at Tio Danny's on restaurant row - the best Mofongo in PR. There is also a Ben & Jerry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ice cream parlor in Old San Juan.", "Date": "December 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, QC", "Title": "\u201cThe good, the location and the awful\u201d", "Author": "jsnoon", "ReviewID": "UR50513673", "Content": "We stayed at the Intercontinental for one night pre-cruise. The Good: We got a great deal on this hotel so it was hard to pass up. The room was nice, clean and bed bug free. I even checked the mattress by removing the sheets and inspecting the seems of the mattress and there was no evidence of bed bugs. Also, the pool area was really nice, but we didn't get to use it because of the weather. The Location: The hotel is in an area where there isn't a lot of local restaurants to eat at and is a little shadey in the evening. The costs of taxis back and forth to Old San Juan ($20 each way) and to the Pan American Pier ($15 each way) really added to the cost of our stay. The Awful: As has been previously mentioned, DO NOT have breakfast in the hotel. There was a torrential downpour the morning we were there, so we decided to eat in the hotel. The cold breakfast ($17) consists of cereal, fruit and store bought mini-pastries. The larger hot breakfast ($22) includes the cheese and cold meats as well as some egg and sausage. In my experience a continental, cold buffet includes the meat and cheeses, so we were surprised when we were charged $22 each for the breakfast we had. Also the service to get coffee and juice was terrible. I never got the milk I asked for for my coffee, I ended up having to go to the buffet for it. Finally when we checked out they asked how our stay was, I said the room was fine, but that the breakfast service was terrible and all I got was a smile and \"that's good\" If you're looking for a good deal and don't plan on going to Old San Juan to eat, then this hotel would be a good option, but please go to the Mi Casita restaurant across the street for breakfast, even in the pouring rain!", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "pinknpretttty", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous resort, wonderful San Juan beachfront\u201d", "Author": "pinknpretttty", "ReviewID": "UR49218863", "Content": "I stayed here last November with my boyfriend, and it was off season so the hotel was not too crowded.

The balconies are rather small and have no balcony furniture to sit on. That, however, was soon remedied when I requested a couple of small banquet chairs (perfect size for the width of the balcony) and got them.

Great idea. Wish more hotels did this. Wine and snacks were purchased at Pueblo supermarket around the corner from the hotel. Good prices.

Beach was excellent and so was the beach bar service (they used to bring me my Medalla beer in a bucket of ice to keep it coldl, again that's good service).

I say honest because I had to leave some vital documents with him when we checked out to be sent home via FedEx. In most places, once you check out, they could care less about you. They might have sent it, they might not have. Here, not only did Nestor ensure these documents were sent as promised, he went out of his way to ensure a copy of my fedex receipt was waiting at my office when I returned. Nestor also gave excellent driving directions and ideas about where to go, what to see, and what kind of timelines to expect for the adventures we wanted to take while visiting. I have read some of the reviews stating that the island is suprisingly poverty ridden, but I disagree. It did not occur to me that is the first impression until I noticed my friend getting nervous in town. The bars on the windows are NOT there because of crime. They are there to protect from things being hurled around during hurricanes. Puerto Rico is an island with a laid back, island lifestyle. As a general rule, they open when they get there and they close when they run out of food or customers, whichever comes first. This slow, easygoing lifestyle is part of what makes Puerto Rico so wonderful! Most of the roads are terrible and poorly marked (because - gee - signs don't stay up in hurricane force winds) and they do drive like there is no traffic law, but as long as you stay alert, there should be no problem. The cleanliness of the hotel was mostly great. We upgraded so had an amazing view (ocean view - top floor) and as far as I could tell, the towels were changed out every day as long as we left the used ones on the floor (which is the same method used in most hotels today to conserve water for laundry if you don't need them changed out). The bathroom and dressing areas were separate from each other and from the main room, so we were able to get ready while maintaining some privacy. I have read some of the reviews about bed bugs and we did experience this a little while we were there. However, considering the proximity to the beach and the fact that \"mimis\" are just a regular part of island life, I don't think it had anything to do with the cleanliness of the hotel. They could easily have been bugs tracked in from the beach. Our ONLY complaint was that we found a tick on top of my friend's bed. Fortunately that was before she ever needed to sleep in it and it was removed quickly. Though the room lacked a microwave, we had a small refrigerator and a safe in which to our electronics and other valuables in while we sat at the pool or on the beach. This made me feel a lot better about leaving things behind so we could go have fun. Being kind of a worrier, I enjoyed peace of mind in leaving our laptops and cell phones in our room. Usually when you go to a hotel where there is nearby construction, the tranquility will be at least somewhat interrupted, but not here. There was a lot of constuction going on in the roadway directly in front of the hotel, but we didn't hear any of it at all. Except when we left and returned to the front entrance of the hotel, we did not even notice it. We did, however, opt for the valet parking so we would not have to find parking in this area of town and then walk through the construction zone. The price for valet versus self-park was only about $6 which was minimal considering the benefits. Inside the hotel, we chose not go into the casino since we decided our luck probably hadn't changed over the years and we would just wind up losing money that we wanted to spend. And, though we swore we were going to spend a day at the spa, we found that we didn't really need it after a full day just enjoying the gorgeous pool and jacuzzi areas. It was clean, bathwater warm, and sparkling. There were waterfalls and lots of little quiet spaces to hide out if you happened to be there for a romantic getaway. The swim up bar served drinks and food, which was really excellent, light fare after a couple of days of eating huge meals. It was your typical little sports bar, but underwater. The food was good, the drinks were better, and Javier was a fun, friendly bartender who was on tap with drinks before we knew we needed refills. For meals, we had room service, dinner at Alfredo's (in the hotel), the Mediterranean Cafe (on the beach), and at the swim up bar. All of the food was amazing! We both tried new items that we had never had before, and also had some of the standard favorites. Since we were there to enjoy the local culture, we also took a drive down highway 26 (east of the hotel) and found our way to one of the many little places to eat that dot the roadways. Our particular favorite was Nana's Place for their pinchos and pastelillos de camarones. Mmmmm! When it came to checkout time, the staff was there to help us take down our luggage and had it loaded in the car before we were even finished with the check-out process. Very efficient and friendly. Tipping is optional, and we did tip. But you won't find them standing there waiting for a tip like you will in some places. Overall, an outstanding visit and a beautiful, relaxing resort. Surprisingly family friendly AND adult friendly. We definitely will go back there again.", "Date": "October 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cBe aware!\u201d", "Author": "TexasTravelChic", "ReviewID": "UR47744257", "Content": "The hotel was nice.

We had a great experience at the Intercontinental Hotel. We had an ocean view room on the 8th floor. The views of the ocean were beautiful. The hotel was well maintained and not outdated. I had stayed at this hotel when it was The Sands back in the mid-eighties. It has been completely changed and updated. Our room was recently updated, clean and comfortable. The furniture was all new, including a flat screen tv. The bed was very comfortable with all the amenities (4 extra large pillows, a down-filled matress pad, luxury mattress). Room service was excellent. The sheets on the bed and towels are exchanged only if you request it. It was stated clearly on the hotel's brochure in order to be eco-friendly. Face it, we don't change our bed sheets and towels at home everyday. For those who complained about poor maid service--try leaving a tip for the maid. They are working for your tips! We had a problem with one phone that went on the blink and the safe also would not open because the batteries inside eventually died. I spoke to the concierge and both were repaired immediately. A new phone was installed and the safe was opened by the hotel engineer. Great service! The doorman James was especially friendly and helpful. We were given $20.00 in casino vouchers to get started, but we never used them. We loved the pool area which was large and the pool has a swim up bar that served light fare. The grounds are beautiful and with mature trees including palms and it is partially shaded with a canopy, which is great for people like me who cannot tolerate the strong sun. There is also a bar and outdoor restaurant next to beach. The beach is clean and the hotel staff kept watch over the guests at the beach. There is also occasional police presence on the beach. The beach and ocean are really nice and clean and quite remarkable considering the fact that you are in a large metropolitan city. I wanted to make a comment about those individuals who claim that there are bedbugs at this hotel. I think it is hysterical. LOL. The fact is that in a tropical setting like Puerto Rico there are mosquitos and they do bite. Also, if you are at the beach and the sun is going down, the \"no-seeums\" come out and start biting. They are small insects and are rarely seen and they render nasty bites! I made the mistake of being on the beach when the sun was going down and they got me on my legs. The food at the hotel was pricey, but it was excellent. The food is not frozen or fast food, it is prepared by trained chefs. You get what you pay for. We thought \"Alfredos\" was excellent. My brother in law and I are amateur gourmet cooks and we are very disciminating when it comes to dining out and we both loved the food. They make their own pasta on site. This italian restaurant offered a special: 2 full courses for $89.00. We tried it and were blown away. The food was excellent. It included an appetizer, wine, main course and dessert. We ate there twice and it was some of the best italian fare we have ever eaten. The veal marsala was the best I have ever had. They also made the best sangria I have ever tasted aside from my own. The halibut was very tender and delicious. The creme brulee was out of this world. The waiters and staff were very attentive. Armando was great and went out of his way to please us. The bar in the main lobby had a special: 2 for 1 mojitos. They were excellent. One night when eating at Alfredo's there was a traditional Puerto Rican dance troupe that performed right outside the restaurant. It was a treat to watch. We also ate breakfast at Alfredo's and it was also excellent. It was pricey, but you get what you paid for. None of the food was processed or frozen. The pastries melted in your mouth. They even had salmon at the buffet. Everything was top notch. We did go out most of the time. We researched the restaurants in San Juan and went out to Old San Juan to eat and explore. San Juan has great restaurants. Do some research before you go. We went to La Bombonera almost every day for breakfast and loved the mallorcas! This restaurant is a local favorite and has been in business since 1902! We also ate at the Parrot Club, Bebo's, El Picoteo. We tried to do Manolin's, but it was crowded and we were short on time. On our last day, we had to check out by noon. We did so and the hotel allowed us to lock up our luggage and use a safety desposit box and a hospitality room at no charge. We stayed and enjoyed the beach and pool until it was time to depart for our 6:30 p.m. flight back home. We loved the Intercontinental and at the price we paid wondered if the hotel made any money. We got the great deal on Cheapcaribbean.com. We would definitely go back again.", "Date": "October 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roswell, GA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "GAPeach-7", "ReviewID": "UR47184677", "Content": "We loved this hotel as well.

I agree with the other reviewer that said the concierges could improve their knowledge a bit. We learned the hard way that the buses only take 75 cents in change and stop running around 10pm. We got to Old San Juan with our 75 cent fares but had to spend $20 on a taxi to get back to the hotel. We thought the concierge should've told us all this up front. We loved the beach, the pool is awesome, the bartenders are nice, attentive, and are generous with the liquor! The beds are comfortable, the showers are big enough, good water pressure, and you never run out of hot water. The hotel has great security which is a plus. My boyfriend was bummed that all the major league baseball games were purchased by some local station so they weren't available on our tv in the room. We watched them at the hotel's bars. We ate lunch at the pool bar and the food was great. We ate our other meals at some local places that we walked to from the hotel. We liked the free (384Kbps) WIFI too that we could access from our room. We are not casino people but I think a casino person would be disappointed with the casino here.

Having never been to Puerto Rico, I was surprised at the poverty. The area around the hotel wasn't bad, but also wasn't great. The roads were torn up, traffic was horrible, and the businesses were seedy! People would pull over and park ANYWHERE - in the middle of the road, blocking an entire lane, etc. We booked our trip through CheapCaribbean and got a great deal. It said we would get a free room upgrade with our booking from a Deluxe Pool/Garden.....and the next upgrade is Ocean View. Upon check-in, I asked for our oceanfront room and was told that the free upgrade is only for a city view room. I showed him the paper that said otherwise, and after some arguing back and forth the check-in assistant agreed and upgraded us to an oceanview room at no charge (as we were supposed to be). The room was gorgeous. Room 908 (9th floor). The view of the ocean was amazing. You could tell that the rooms were a bit older but had been upgraded. Newer paint, flatscreen TV, refrigerator, etc. Some people on here complained about a smell - everything smelled fine to me. The only thing that the room was lacking was a microwave. And yes - as others said, the refrigerators get TOO cold and sometimes freeze your food and drinks. Overall I'd give the room an 8.5 out of 10. I have heard others complain about \"bed bugs.\" We did have a lot of bites on our legs, but we also visited the rainforest and walked on the beach at night so I can't say if these bites came from the ROOM or from being outside. Either way, it wasn't a huge deal to me. I didn't see a single bug in the hotel or in our room, and everything seemed very nice and clean. As others stated, housekeeping didn't replenish towels. We called down to the lobby and they sent some up immediately. We visited the casino one night. It's nice and small and out of the way. I actually won $80 on the penny and nickel machines! Towards the back of the casino where you redeem your winnings, it looked like it needed some updating (gaps in walls, etc.) We didn't eat at the hotel - there are plenty of other places to eat for cheaper. Church's Chicken, Denny's, Burger King, etc. I'm a picky eater so it was nice to have a wide variety of food around you within walking distance. If you rent a car (we did for the entire time), beware! Ha. The drivers there are HORRID. It seemed like every other car had a burnt out tail light, and they would swerve in front of you like speed demons. It takes some getting used to. You'll see trucks pulled over int he middle of the road, and you have to go around them. The cops do NOT care what people do on the road or where they park from what it seemed. I also saw many police vehicles with their lights on....casually driving down the road. I think they turned their lights on simply to get around some of the traffic. We did use the \"business center\" at the hotel to print our boarding passes. They offer free wi-fi in the rooms, but if you need to print anything you need to use one of their computers. I was charged $5 for 10 minutes of internet usage, and $1 per page in black and white. OUTRAGEOUS! We did NOT get charged any \"resort fees,\" but you DO have to pay $16 a day for self parking. Seems expensive, but what can you do. The parking in this area is just HORRENDOUS - nowhere near enough parking. Upon checkout, everything went smoothly. We paid $55 in parking fees (Mon afternoon until Fri at 12 noon). Keep in mind that we did travel in mid-October (off season), which was GOOD. Less crowds! The weather was fantastic. The rain showers last maybe 15 minutes, and then it's back to bright sunny weather! One thing to mention - it is SO HUMID IN PUERTO RICO! Not a single breeze, just HOT AND HUMID. We were dripping sweat from walking only 15 minutes in Old San Juan. Be prepared! There are many Walgreen's on the island, but the one close to the Intercontinental is HIGH PRICED. Expect to pay double what you do at a Walgreen's in the States. We stopped at another Walgreens in Old San Juan that had much better prices. If it's close to the tourist hotels, chances are it's overpriced! For anyone else going, you MUST go to Flamenco Beach on Culebra. GORGEOUS. The best beach in the world. It's a $2.50 ferry ride from Fajardo (an hour from the Intercontinental), and $2.50 back. The snorkeling is phenomenal, and the beach is out of this world. We also saw the rainforest and Old San Juan, but Culebra was the highlight of our trip. If your goal is to see a great beach and snorkel......Culebra is for you! Overall - if you can get a good deal, it's a very nice hotel. Not perfect, but definitely not bad like some people have claimed. I paid $1100 for roundtrip flights for 2 out of Minneapolis and my free oceanfront room upgrade, including tax. That boiled down to about $100 a night for an oceanfront view, which is normally $250 a night. The Intercontinental was a great choice given the price we paid. I'd easily rate it a 9 out of 10. Not perfect, but definitely a very nice hotel. Very convenient location, and excellent pool (which is open 24 hours!)

The pool was awesome, the Mediterranean Cafe by the beach was awesome too, the pool waterfalls were awesome the lounging area/chair availability was awesome. It was a great area to relax. In terms of location, the hotel was awesome too. Only $12 from the airport and $20 form Old San Juan. It is surrounded by places were to do simple shopping, eating and even getting licor at a discounted price. We went to Pueblo (24hr supermarket) to get our licor and some snacks, to Rest Don Jose and Chilis to get some food and to Walgreens to get some Sunblock. We walked a little further on Friday night at 3:30am and we got yummy pizza :) Oh BTW, the area is constantly patrolled by the local police and the tourist zone police so you feel very safe at all times. If you wanted to go anywhere, either by foot or by taxi the staff was friendly & super nice to give you directions and help. The only detail I think they should improve is their knowledge of nightlife options. We like to dance but when we asked the staff about places to do some dancing they didn't really know any other place than their neighbor hotel San Juan (great for Salsa) or the Newyorican Cafe in Old San Juan (great place too!). They should get more familiar with the party scene around the area for people like us who like thelocal night life. The hotel also had a 24 hours security force .

Concierge staff was awesome and very helpful with recommendations, directions and web check in. Self-parking is across the street from the hotel, but easy and convenient. Location is super close to the airport. Casino is small but seemed to have the basics. Having heard how expensive the hotel restaurants were from reviews, we decided to eat off campus. There are several restaurants near this location and it is on the beach. Restaurants Mi Casita \u00e2\u20ac\u201c right across the street from the hotel, reasonably priced, small, good food (enjoyed the mofongo and tostones). Service was a little slow, but still a good place for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Raices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c right across from the parking deck the hotel suggests you use in Old San Juan. Small, energetic atmosphere with traditionally dressed servers. Food was good. Appetizers are expensive for what you get but tasty. Tornado (steak, shrimp with side) was good. La Bombonera \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Old San Juan; old school Puerto Rican restaurant. Went for breakfast and LOVED the mallorca! Very quick. Activities Caves and observatory \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We rented a car for $62 total for the almost 3 days we were there which gave us nice flexibility. We drove to the Camuy caverns ($12/person) and observatory ($6/person) which are in the same area and make sense to be done together and it took us about 1.5 hrs to get there (easy drive). That excursion would have cost $236 ($118/person) thru the hotel. Go early because the more people there are, the longer you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to wait your turn to be shuttled down to the caves. You could also hit the Bacardi facility or the large mall on the way back to San Juan (we ran out of time). El Morro \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Very interesting and inexpensive (~$6?). Lots of stairs. La Rumba \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dance party on a boat with bay tour. For $13 each we got to dance salsa, merengue, bachata, reggaeton while cruising around the bay (1 hour) in Old San Juan. The signage and flyers say the experience is 2 hours but the tour is only 1 and they sat at the dock for the first hour (with music). Note on driving to Old San Juan We drove to Old San Juan with no problem. Finding parking on the street was crazy so we parked in a deck in the evenings that was only $3 or $4 (take singles with you).

Older, but in good condition. Beautiful property. Nice foliage and fauna; flowers. Nice front desk/lobby area. Small casino (mostly 5 cent/10 cent/ 25 cent machines; $5 blackjack was great; had $15/$25). Right now the city is trying to upgrade the roads so you can't really blame anyone for TRYING to do right by the citizens and visitors. So the road outside of the hotel is torn up a bit, but the sidewalk is okay. Beware - RESORT FEE (added to the room charge), approx $25 per day per room; not sure how thats calculated. We were 2 people, so it might be $12per person, who knows? But it was on the bill! GREAT STAFF. Door was held open 90% of the time. Lobby was always clean and polished. Security was abundant; but no intrusive. Saw some kids come in off the street and head for the hotel, security was right behind them and asked them if they stayed her in Spanish. He politely escorted them to the door. Although there were many families, you didn't see kids running through the lobby. Staff was kind. Tipped daily. Room was cleaned daily. Towels daily. NO complaints! Pool had plenty of towels. Remember, we visited here OFF SEASON, OCT. 1 TO 4, 2009. I imagine things might be different going IN-SEASON when its busier and more crowded. We typically travel to places off season since we hate crowds and love the feeling of 'owning' the place; having it ourselves a bit. So, take everything w/ a grain of salt said in this review if you are going in the heat of the peak tourist season. Saw two beautiful twins, about 17 months old, with their mother. They stayed at the pool from 11am to 5pm almost. This hotel is family oriented. Soft music plays over their pool speakers. Clean pool. Board games you can check out at the activities desk. Call ahead to see if the 'kid center' is open; its seasonal and might be closed. I'd definitely bring our young daughter. Plenty of places for little ones to roam within watching distance in the sense of 'space' - there's enough area around the pool; its not cramped. Stay here IF you want to be close to the airport, right on the beach. 5 minutes from airport. $13 cab ride + $4 tip! Cheap! This is NOT the best beach in PR; this is a NICE beach; on par with Fort Lauderdale. There are better beaches all over the island, like Luquillo (about an hour drive away), but its nice. A bit crowded on Sundays, but still plenty of beach left. Locals take advantage of it; its not private, but nice. Stay here IF you want to lounge at the pool. It was closed the first day we were there for repairs (had been for a few weeks), but they did give $50 food/beverage credit PER DAY! Wow! We enjoyed spending time that on food and bar stuff. The trick was to spend it all that day! It was weird, but it didn't carry over it seems. I thought that was a 'trick'. At other resorts we've been at, you got $50 and you just spent it before you checked out, you didn't need to spend it that actual day or on a specific day. Anyway, it worked out! Stay here IF you want to be near Old San Juan, the Ritz Carlton is down the street, 5 to 8 minute walk (bigger, nicer casino; nice pool; some great photo ops at night!). SAVING MONEY TIPS: 1. Buy your own bottle of liquor, snacks & water at the grocery: Hotel is near the \"Pubelo\" - a local grocery chain. Nice. Reminded me of our 'Publix' or Winn Dixie. Clean, organized. You can get 90% of what's in an American grocery. When we arrived, we walked to the grocery (about a 10 minute walk; you have to go behind the Chilis restaurant; its in the corner, near the highway; seems odd when walking there, but its safe; just go right at the Chilis, head towards the highway, make a right and there's the big grocery). Water - you can get a 12 pack of Dasini water for $3.50. Why buy at the hotel? Liquor - there's a large selection of rum at the grocery store; all local favorites. Get it there cheap. Don't overbuy because remember you can't take it on the plane; you can pack it in your suitcase, but you can't board with it. Remember that, UNLESS you buy it after you check in at duty free! Excellent choices. Also, you have glasses in your room. I would make a cocktail, then walk downstairs and enjoy the free music or tour the property or go sit out by the pool or go get in the jacuzzi...why pay for $10 drinks when for $13 you can buy Bacardi Select and make 15 STIFF drinks! 2. EAT LOCAL: What's the point of visiting a town, just to eat hamburgers! So try the food! In Old San Juan, we ate at the \"Cafe Puerto Rico\" - excellent! Authentic. Huge meal for $7.99! Excellent Mojiotos - $6. Actually the best I had while there; smooth, no seltzer after-taste, very smooth and nice; not overly sweet. PERFECTION. Next door to the hotel is Don Pepe - make a left as you exit the hotel, its about 5 minutes; past that bar, Lupis; somewhat caddy corner to the Chilis. It's a small local eatery. Clean. Good! Great service. Meals around $8 to $10. FRESH. You wait about 15 minutes for it to come out, but take out was excellent! ON Sunday, I walked over to the grocery store for a few souvenirs, grabbed lunch there. The buffet at the grocery store is excellent; all fresh; long line, but worth the wait. Huge meal for $5.99. 3. POOL BAR & FOOD: Overall, I have to say that the few things they did as it relates to \"Puerto Rican\" flavor, they did well. Good tropical drinks! True, you might want to splurge on one drink at the bar. Even though, I'll admit it, I played poolside Bingo at the activities events, won a free drink ticket, BUT I already had my own drink from my room while I was playing bingo. But I did try their swim-up pool-bar. We purchased a sandwhich right before we left for the airport at the pool bar - TRIPLETA. Very good! $15.00 - we had a similar sandwhich for $7.99 down the street at Don Pepes, but hubby liked it so much, he spotted it on their menu and wanted it again; 3 meats - Puerto Rican ham, steak, and something else...piled high. Very good though, even if it was DOUBLE THE PRICE, not including tip. I guess at any resort, you have to balance being frugal with splurging. We splurged on the occasional drink, even though 85% of our liquor drinks were made in our room. We splurged on a sandwhich on property, even though 95% of our meal was eaten off property or take-out from another local place and brought back to our room to eat. 4. GREAT LIVE MUSIC & EXCELLENT BAR STAFF This was a highlight - they have GREAT live bands that play almost each night. One night, I saw 3 lives bands (3 piece small lounge bands)...all very good; they play for about 2 hours each; pack up and go. I was shocked by the talent and diversity; I listened to Salsa, then Latin Jazz, then instrumental, etc. It was great! Even though there's no club on site, for me the music was enough. If you are a young person looking for a CLUB bar scene (try Bravo, not sure of what hotel its at, but heard the younger college kids talking about that). But its not a CLUB hotel; this is a more elegant hotel. I'm 37 and I would say you mostly saw middle-aged professionals to older people; not a ton of teens around, and you saw late 30s people like me with young babies. If you want peace, quiet with a little bit of flair in the evening , then this is it. If you are looking for party party hard hotels (like the Hard Rock), then go elsewhere! But again be careful - drinks at the lobby bar are $11 each and w/ tip around $14, charged to the room, you can run up a tab quick! I loved the TAMARIND DELIGHT. Excellent. I splurged on that. BUT again, I would bring my drink down in my own glass, then to top my evening off, I'd order the Tamarind Delight. They don't bother you if you walk into the bar w/ a glass since its a lounge bar. They have no idea if you got it at the casino or where. Just use your in-room glass! BUT great attentive staff. Pretty waitresses! Nice bartenders. WHAT'S BAD: Alfredos - AVOID THE ITALIAN RESTAURANT. I'm writing management on this now that we are back in town. If you can't do Italian right, then don't bother. I had to send my soup back. Tasted like dish water. My husbands risotto was just average; he makes better at home and we're not Italian. They missed the boat on this. When I visit PR, I want PR food. Why not give me authentic baked goods, food, and drinks in a restaurant there. Why do I have to leave the property for a 'taste of PR'. Crazy! Beautiful restaurant. Great outdoor area. I sat there Sunday morning for a cup of $3.50 coffee, then tip = $5. Wow! I could have walked down the street to Don Pepes for a $1.50 or $2 Cafe Con Leche or something. But I was lazy. Its sad that such a great restaurant on this property is wasted. If you read other reviews, most diners HATE Alfredos. Overall, this trip did the trick for us - it was a nice location. In the center of it all. Thursday night, we checked in and used our $50 room credit; hung around the lobby bar and ate at that terrible Alfredos; Friday day we toured Old San Juan, then walked down to the Ritz. Hubby entered a Poker tournament there; lost after a few hours, but that was cool; it was entertainment for him. I sat by their lovely pool at the Ritz while he pokered! Saturday morning we rented a Jeep, put the top down, and drove to El Yunque. Excellent adventure. Sunday we lounged around the pool and went home. We stayed in 1616 - 16th floor; right -off the elevator. It was fairly quiet. Some kids moved in next door, but I was knocked out; hubby heard them, but I didn't. Excellent bed! Thick, comfy! Loved the ocean view. Would return again. Very romantic. Our first trip without our 17 month old; she stayed home w/ Grandma. Worth the visit! Definitely rejuvenated us. We were ready to leave because we missed our daughter, but if she was with, we could have stayed another 2 or 3 days! Would definitely return again. Just be smart and shop local, eat local. The hotel's drinks & food are a bit overpriced considering what's right outside your door in walking distance - local food & groceries...so...use the hotel for a great stay, pool, quiet, safe atmosphere, etc. BUT don't be afraid to take a 10 minute stroll for groceries or get the local food. And yes, there's a Burger King, Dennys, and a few other 'American' places nearby in walking distance too! Chilis is 5 minutes away too! And next door is the Old San Juan Hotel and they have STARBUCKS & other places to eat!", "Date": "October 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cBEWARE!!!

Our travel agent, Jimmy Strohmaier from Liberty Travel, found a great deal, so we jumped on it. The hotel is a ten minutes taxi ride ($10 +$1 per bag) from the airport. Upon arriving at the hotel there was hardly any wait to check in, but our rooms were not ready. The desk person gave us a few comp drink coupons, so we checked our luggage and explored the place. We ended up walking down the beach and grabbing lunch at a small hotel. The rooms were ready about an hour later, and we were all pleasantly surprised at their size and view. Each was on the 4th floor, but ours had a slightly better view, but ours also had a funny smell that we quickly got used to. I did call housekeeping about it and they came up and sprayed an air freshener, but that was a temporary fix. I contemplated complaining, but we were close to our friends, so we decided to deal with it. The pool was great. The beach was reasonably clean and the water was very refreshing. The hotel provides free chairs and umbrellas on the beach. While at the hotel we ate at the Hibachi place, the name is escaping me at the moment, but it was pretty good. Slightly inflated pricing, but it was fun none the less. The host, Franco, was very accommodating. The bar/restaurant closest to the beach is ok. The entr\u00c3\u00a9es we had were good, but the appetizers kind of stunk. On our last day they shut down the pool bar and pool for a two week renovation. The hotel was offering everyone staying at the hotel during this period a $50 F&B credit. Not bad, but I think I'd rather have a working pool. We visited Old San Juan and had dinner at Rosa de Triana, just across from the Convento Hotel. This place is a must eat - we tried 7 different tapas and shared a pitcher of their very tasty sangria. Give it a try! Taxis to and from the hotel added up quickly ($21 each way), but with 4 of us sharing the tab it wasn't so bad. We also visited El Yunque, a rainforest about 40 minutes from the hotel. There is a scheduled tour that is like $60 per person, but we opted to rent a car from Enterprise for only $27 and drove ourselves there. Seriously, you DO NOT need a tour guide at the park. Wake up early, get your car and go for it. Visit the visitor center and you will be good to go. ALSO, if you do it early enough in the day you can visit Loquillo, a town about 10 minutes from El Yunque. It is a great little beach town that is relatively free of tourist traffic.

I certainly recommend taking the city bus (75 cents) to its terminus next to Old San Juan where you can board a free trolley that goes throughout OSJ.

The Ponderosa (right across the street) has a great salad bar that comes with all choices except the hamburger.

I would however NEVER pay full price for it when there are so many other nicer hotels in PR. Our friends were staying next store at El San Juan and whereas it felt a little cheesy miami-beach in decor, it was still much nicer. Both hotels share the same beach which is nice and seemed clean but we found there are much nicer beaches throughout the island. Isla verde itself is somewhat of a just ok area. It is touristy and developed because there are quite a few hotels and condos but would otherwise be not a great place to stay. If I had to do it again, I would probably book near the ashford avenue areas...equally touristy but closer to old San Juan and far nicer looking. Probably worth the addional $10 -$15 in cab fare from the airport. I was opposed to the fact that they charge extra for umbrella rentals. Resort fees seem to be the norm in PR and this hotel seemed to charge less than some of the others. It was nice that they warned us about this in advance. Skip the breakfast. $22 definitely not worth it and it baffled me that they had less than adequate non-tropical and fruit in a tropical location. Plenty of other cheaper places to eat nearby.

However afetr walking the property we decided to upgrade further to the more private residences which also featured a private club (lounge/coffee etc). We were truly impressed when we got the new room! Overlooking the pool area, right in the middle of everything, but when you retire for the night you wouldnt even know everything was right outside. It was so quiet and peaceful. In the morning you went out on your private nicely appointed balcony to drink coffee. Sure the food is a bit overpricedbut you can walk to just about anything if you dont want to eat on premises. The staff was MORE than gracious, and I really want t thank Rosie and the other consierre (sorry I cant remember his name) but they really know and love their jobs! The front desk staff especially William, could not be outdone. I truly felt like we were the only guests they had.Dont forget to go to old san juan 75 cents by bus/but we found a taxi for $10.00.

Ive stayed at many different resorts in different countries, Jamaica, Dominican Republic (twice), Mexico (three times), Sicily, and I have NEVER experienced what the hotel people were calling sand fleas. I talked to the hotel manager and he was not nice about it. I told him that I was very unhappy that I had to wake up every morning with bug bites all over my legs at a four star resort.

We get to the room and are floored the view, the room, everything was perfect and clean. We went to the 24 hr pool, yes, 24 hrs. and the relaxing began. During our stay we visited Old San Juan a couple of times (take the bus, 75 cents opposed to 20+ for a cab) The forts are very interesting, especially if you like history. On Tuesday nights @ 6pm they have a cultural festival at the Castillo de San Cristibol fort, one of our favorite activities. There are TONS of shops in Old San Juan, BEN AND JERRY'S ROCKED! I definitely recommend those things as well as YOU MUST go to Senior Frog's, you'll see when you get there. While @ the Intercontinental we booked the snorkeling trip... SO WORTH IT! We went on the Spreadeagle II (the crew are top-notch and fun) and had our favorite day in Puerto Rico. So much to mention. oh yeah, across the street there is a nice cigar store called Cigars PR if you like that kind of thing. Plenty of places to eat outside the resort so save your money, but do eat @ the Japanese restaurant. Despite all the bad reviews I read about it, they were ALL wrong. I think it's more about your attitude not theirs. DO NOT EXPECT FREE REFILLS on ANY drinks ANYWHERE except Denny's. We will be going back hopefully sooner than later.

We loved coming home to the sound of the little Coqui frogs and all of the lush plants at our hotel. The pool was great, the beach was beautiful, and the hotel had a quiet elegance at night. Were our rooms the largest and most luxurious accommodations we've ever had? No, but we don't go on vacation to stay in our room. It was very nice, the beds were more than comfortable, we had the usual amenities, everything worked and most importantly, it was clean. The only thing I will say is that the walls are quite thin so act accordingly! The casino at the hotel is low key and does not distract from the family atmosphere of the hotel. We went to the Ritz Carlton and ESJ, the hotel next door, to do our gambling and enjoy the night life. As with most resorts, things can be a bit pricey but no more than usual. La Casita across the street has great meals for very little money. There is a Starbucks, a Brother Jimmy's Barbecue restaurant and a nice pizza place next door at ESJ. You definitely should rent a car to go to El Yunque, take a hike to the falls and visit some of the beaches in Fajardo. Take the Bioluminescence trip, it's definitely worth the money, but take the tour for that, it's at night and you don't want to get lost. One last tip...if you visit during the summer months, go to Old San Juan early in the morning and get to the beach by midafternoon - it gets unbearably hot !! Yes, there is a lot of construction on Isla Verde Blvd, but there is a lot of construction all over San Juan so it's not exclusive to this hotel.

The hotel is located closer to the exit of Loiza so you are better off taking that route because it can take you about an hour just because of the traffic on that street. Check in was ok, I had to wait about 15 minutes to check in, there was 2 employees checking people in. I got an excellent price on Hotwire.com 2 days they charged me $275.00 and at checkout I wasnt charged the $14.00 daily resort fee. Parking (valet) came out to 23.00 per day which was fine if you would see how the street parking is over there you will pay the valet.The guys in Valet and at the door were excellent. Very polite, helpful and professional. Cute too :). At check in I requested a room that faces the pool and the beach but I was told it was 20.00 more a night , so I told the gentleman for get it, I knew this trip was gonna cost me and I didnt want to pay $40.00 more to see the beach, when I got to the room I was surprised because he did go ahead and give me the room I requested at no additional cost which I thought was a great start, that was nice of him. The room was beautiful, I had room 412, its a king size. The bed was sooooooo comfortable. Very soft, very clean. The room had a full size sofa bed and another chair, you can see in the pics. The room is big and we had a little balcony which I had my view of the pool and beach. I had free WiFi in the room so looking for things to do online was very simple. The room, towels, bathroom,sheets were super clean. Im very picky with that and I couldnt complain about the hotel at all. The Casino is small but very popular. I guess Im used to the casinos in Vegas and its not like that but it is a good size. Theres security everywhere, so you dont have to worry about your safety. I was in the pool till about 2am and there was security doing rounds like every 10 minutes because anyone from the beach can get in because the hotel is on the beach. The only thing I didnt like but I did understand is that to be in the pool area between 9-6pm you have to have a color band. I understand the pool was only for guests but I have family in PR that I wanted them to come drink with me at the bar by the beach and pool area but they were not allowed and they dont have a guest pass because I called front desk. I did get my aunt and uncle in just by getting them my bands and they said nothing to me about not having one, maybe they remembered me from the day before or they just didnt mind because in the 3 hours I was at the pool I spent $150.00 in drinks which was served to me by a very nice, cute waiter lol. Yes the drinks are expensive a medalla cost me $6.00 which that is the PR beer and when I went to the bar in Catano I paid $1.00, but I expected it to be that way this is a 4 star hotel so It didnt bother me. Just imagine how much I paid for the sex on the beach ----UFF-- lol. The access to the beach also has security and it was beautiful especially at night for a midnight stroll. Youll see people on the beach at night just relaxing, its very romantic. I went to a nice little spot called lupis the food wasnt that great but it had alot of people in there so the music was good they play english, spanish everything. Pricing I thought was ummmm high for the food but the service was great. I went to a club called Drums, and it was nice. Im 36 so listening to 80's rock, like Bon Jovi, Poison, also Erasure, Depeche Mode, Gino Latino and Spanish rock was great. They also played salsa and merengue, I went on Friday , I didnt hear reggaeton tho. The drinks there are real cheap. After there we left about 3am 3:30 we went to a restaurant call Don Jose which was on the way back to the hotel. Mind you we went to all these places by foot because they were all close by. Im glad because parking in that strip is crazy, expensive and good luck is you find any because this area is very busy. You have a mini fridge in the room and we stepped out the the grocery store Pueblo close to the hotel which is open 24 hours and bought like water, beer, and chips.

This is how our story begins. We traveled down for a getaway for my 50th. We checked in, everything was beautiful. The room had all the necessary amenities. The next morning, full of bravura and little common sense, I jumped into the normally placid ocean. A storm happened to be brewing off shore and the waves lifted me up and dropped me on the beach and pounded some sense into me. So I spent the next ten days surfing a wheelchair with a herniated back. And this is where the staff part comes in. I got adopted.

We paid without fuss. Check in unbelievably long, other than that, we called concierge and front desk often for information and they were always kind and helpful. Had a clean, non-ocean front room with 2 double beds. Bathroom is the tiniest I've ever seen. Only about a few inches between toilet edge and the door. Housekeeping failed to leave enough wash cloths/towels each day so we called daily for more. Beds were comfortable, short on pillows. One Pool-average size and crowded at times, with some tree leaves and bird feathers floating around. Hot tub okay. Ciao grill on beach has good food and smoothies although over priced. Pigeons, crows and lizards were all around in the pool/grill area. Won $10 in casino... thats always nice. Booked swedish massages for my two daughters. $55 for a half hour. It was my daughter's 18th birthday and so I didnt mind the price. One strange occurrence: one morning my daughter and I brought back a croissant, hash browns and OJ from BK and decided to eat in the pool area because we'd seen others doing this the day before. One of the employees near the towel bar was starring at us very hard then slowly followed us to our seats. He stated we could not eat in the chairs but had to go to the boardwalk area. We then proceeded there as he slowly followed us again. By the time we picked out a clean table, he then told us we could not sit there either per his mgr over the walkie talkie. Now I dont know if his mgr had eyes all over the area or if this guy was simply picking on us or racist or what, but I was very aggravated after moving twice. We finally proceeded to our room to eat in peace. Besides Ciao, we did not eat at any of the other restaurants in the hotel. Ruth Chris was closed. For my daughter's 18th celebration, We were told to go to the Palm restaurant next door as a good steak house with seafood. It turned out to be a very poor choice. We had swordfish, king crab, and my youngest had chicken tenders. The other party with us, got the lobster for 2 special. It took FOREVER to get our food and it was SUPER OVERPRICED. Our ticket was $250.00 and the food was less than desired...no taste at all and they dont give you enough to eat. No salads or veges to go with meal like most places. This was the worst part of my trip because I truly felt I wasted money. Resort Beach was clean and had average crowd. Only went out there once for a few minutes, but my youngest became irritated or something was stinging her so we quickly got out and headed back to pool. This resort had no night life and nothing for my 14 and 18 year old daughters to do. We wanted to do some of the excursions (zip line, rainforest, caves, or biobay), but all were pricey for 3 people and did not include transportation. I did enjoy visiting plaza las americas($20 each way by taxi). Very large mall with prices similar to the states. Off the resort, we went to old san juan $20 by taxi each way. I dont understand the hype. Everyone says its a must see, but for me it was OKAY...saw the forts, rode the trolley, walked the crooked sidewalks in the heat, visited a few stores, coach and such, but nothing special. In fact, the highlight of my visit to old san juan, was the BEN & JERRY's ice cream parlor. The strawberry cheescake ice cream in the homemade waffle cone was sooo delicious. About the immediate resort area. Trash is on the street everywhere and there are bad smells from garbage. Be careful on sidewalks as they are very uneven and some are partially contrustructed. There is a chilis and dennys to the left, several blocks down after you pass ESJ hotel. A few blocks to the right is a walgreens, KFC, dominos, pizza hut, churches, wendys, burger king, and some local restaurants and stores. We patiently waited 40 minutes in wendys, 30 minutes at burger king. Workers moved very slow as if on Jamaica time. Walgreens and dominos had much quicker service. Note: there is way too much contruction on Isla Verde Ave directly in front of the hotel. Dont expect to catch the city bus as scheduled. We waited forever in the heat one morning, but it never came and so we quickly hopped in a taxi that stopped in front of us. Overall, It was an okay trip. I was just happy to be away from home and work, but I know I will not come back to PR. We found Mexico to be a much choice.

The room was clean, bed was perfect, they have updated sheets and the minute you walk into the hotel, it smells clean. The staff at the hotel were incredibly helpful and incredibly polite. There was never a shortage of top quality service. The service, however, as in most of Caribean could be slow. We did go to MiCasita for breakfast almost every day, affordable, decent food, but really slow service. We took a cab into Old San Juan, I recommend eating at Tio Danny's on restaurant row - the best Mofongo in PR. We tried 3 other restaurants and nothing compared. The pool is open 24/7 - so a room on the 3-6th floors facing the pool/beach (one in the same) would be annoying. We choose the $150 upgrade and got on the 15th floor and had an incredible beach view and heard nothing from the pool. They have an incredible gym that faces the ocean. The beach was beautiful, very, very clean - no sea weed or rocks. The only dissappointment we had was the waves were not existent. We like some waves in which to body surf. Put it to you this way, my friend who is a non swimmer went in the ocean to his chest because the water was so calm. We choose the catamaran excursion from the hotel, $89 per person, and it was really a lot of fun and a worthwhile expense. We were there for 6 night - and that was just about right. Down Side: There is no night life at the hotel at all, the street is under construction so it is difficult to walk and there is not much to walk to.

The room was adequate, comfortable bed, had the amenities reported, old tv. Nice view of the mountains when ignoring the mess down on the street. The staff are extremely friendly, professional and helpful. In fact everyone we met in Puerto Rico was like this. Taking the local buses is easy and cheap. Gentlemen stand to give seats to women. Be patient waiting for the bus, enjoy talking with locals, learn about real life in PR. We really enjoyed the catarraman snorkeling trip and rain forest trip. We even rented a car for a day and drove thru the mountains to the south coast. Dining is on the expensive side in the hotel. Had one very enjoyable and reasonably priced dinner at the beachside restaurant, pizza and salad. Most of our dining out was at local places. Food and liquor shopped at Pueblo which is a 5 minute walk. Rented a Hobie sailboat next door. Many reviews reccomended Mi Casita for dining. It was our least favorable place. Enjoyed the Plaza de Mercado, a local fruit market and restaurant area. Had a great batida, a blended fruit drink. The pool is wonderful. Overall this was a great trip.

I only deal in four star hotels, so it's safe to say, I know what I'm looking for. Since I was spending my dime on this trip and not the company's money, I did extensive research to make sure I was getting a good deal, and the hotel would meet my expectations. I went through Bookingwiz.com, and selected a deal through Hotwire, for about $500 each (two people). The duration of the stay was from June 15 - 19. The hotel is extremely close to the airport, less than five minutes, and a $12 cab ride. The closeness to the airport concerned me since I read some reviews that said they heard planes constantly. I heard nothing in the room. Occassionally, on the beach I head the \"roar\" of the planes' engines as they were landing/taking from the airport.. This is nothing to concern yourself with. You'll know that you're in for a wonderful stay as your cab comes up the beautiful tropical driveway. The bellstaff are exceptional. I have read about the long lines for check-in; however, I believe since we arrived on Monday, we missed the crowd. We were offered the $150 upgrade for a beachfront room, I took it because I knew that under normal circumstances it is $80 per day. You will also have to pay a resort fee. It's based on a percentage of your room fee. Our's was approximately $14 a day. For any decent, big upscale resort, this is typical, so don't have a cow. Our reserved room was ready, but due to the upgrade, we had to wait until approximately 3P to get our room. They did call my cell phone while we hung out a the pool bar (food and drinks were wonderful while waiting) to let me know the room was ready. I did have to ask to move to another beachfront room because I did not feel that my money should have gone to a room that had a rusty refrige, due to humidity, a non flat screen TV (as promised) and orverlooked the faded out paint job on the casino's roof. The second room was just fine. The pool area is amazing, the beach area clean (no seaweed), chairs are free (umbrella a charge of $10). We never needed one because we had slight cloud coverage daily, this kept some of the heat away. I will say, save your time running around buying stuff (lotion sunscreen, etc), and stuffing your suitcase before you leave home because there is a Walgreen's to the left and right of the hotel (within walking distance). You can pick up all of your supplies there. If purse strings are a little tight on cash, there are plenty of non-hotel eateries around (Chili's, Burger King, Pizza Hut, etc, etc) I'm not a huge fan of experimeting with food, but there are also plenty of other local eateries in Old San Juan. Old San Juan is a wonderful area to walk and take in the beautiful colors of the city. Be mindful though, it is $20 each way, to get to/from Old San Juan, via cab. As far as adventures, we did a snorkeling adventure. I'm an Atlanta city girl so I've never done anything like that before. OMG, what an experience!!! I went with the Spread Eagel tour. As far as I'm concerened, a good choice. Approximately $103 (incls. pick-up from hotel, excurision, food, gear, underwater camera). Didn't do a lot of touring, but others we spoke with said that the rainforest was great, and touring around to other cities was nice. You should note, if renting a car, the locals drive like New Yorkers. To conclude, special thanks to Ray, an individual that works as bellstaff -- great person, great assistance. This was a wonderful trip/stay, trying see how fast I can get back here.

We eat at Mi Casita (we read so many good things about this place and the food) the first night it was a little crowded the food was cold and the cornish hen was so dry you could not eat it, service was poor, we gave this place a second chance for breakfast- not many customers this time, but again the service was horrible, they served our coffee and the food arrived 25 minutes later no refills on the coffee, not one time asked if everything was ok, same way the night we eat there also. The staff just stood there and stared at us the entire time, a very uncomfortable feeling ~ needless to say we did not go back and will not in the future. We did a day of sailing and snorkling with East Winds these folks are awesome, we had a great time. Overall one oth the best vacations I've ever taken and would stay at the InterContinental Hotel again - the neighborhood surrounding the hotel however, does need a little cleaning up.

On the beach the lounge chairs are free for guests (expected a fee), at the pool the chairs are comfortable and updated. The food and drinks at the pool were also above average. We were able to swim up to the bar and order our drinks and food - which were always prepared well. The bed was incredibly comfortable. After all of the on-the-go activities of the day, it was nice to have an extremely comfortable bed to come \"home\" to. Also, the rooms were very quiet. An occasional sound from the hallway were the only sounds that we heard over the 4 days. The toiletries were also good quality - no need to bring all of your own soaps, shampoos, lotions... The concierge and trip planner were very helpful with recommendations of local restaurants as well as exciting excursions. The Alfredo restaurant was very nice, while very empty. Both the food and wine menu were better than expected for the hotel property restaurant. The location - based upon ease to get elsewhere in the city easily was good. A quck 3 minute taxi got us to/from the airport. It was about $20 to get to Old San Juan and we were near the highway for our tours. Could have been better: Our room overlooked the roof of the casino - though it was labeled pool-view. You could see the pool, true, but it was beyond the roof view just outside our balcony. Compared to the luxury of the bed linens, the towels were older and scratchy. There was not too much going on at the hotel. Jazz played nightly at the lounge bar, but other than that, no real \"life\" to speak of at the Intercontinental. The area of town is not the best looking area. Though it seemed safe enough, it was a little dirty and run down. However, this did not mean that we could not find dining gems within walking distance. Overall, it was a good place to retire to each night and a good place to relax by the water. When we wandered over to the El San Juan next door, we found the \"nightlife\" we were looking for; happening casino, many lounge bars with many younger patrons, salsa music and Brother Jimmy's BBQ on the roof with an amazing view of the area. Our concierge suggested Barrachina for authentic Puerto RIcan food. Though it was virtually empty on a Thursday night, the food was amazing! We also found a small local restaurant across the street, Mi Casita, which also had great food at low prices. Avoid the hotel breakfast buffet and head across the street! We took the LA Marquesa Canopy tour - well worth the time and money. The guides were friendly and made us first-timers feel safe while swinging through the trees. We also took the short El Yunque tour. This one was good for those just wanted to check \"rainforest\" off their list. If you want to really explore it on your own, there is probably a better tour or get a rental car and go out on your own.

It is noisy in the front. You will hear traffic and planes all day. The balconies are small and no room for chairs. The room was clean although candy wrappers were found. The furnishings were on the old side but the bed was great. There is a separate vanity area for the ladies with a magnifying mirror, vanity bench and plenty of light. There's a safe, old TV, IPOD station and free wireless internet throughout. The restaurants are expensive as well as the drinks. There are good local restaurants all within walking distance. Try Mi Casita direclty across the street. There are also fast food places close by. The pool area is nice with 2 bar/restaurants. The chairs are taken early by way of \"towel\" reservations so go early and pick your spot. The beach is clean, the water perfect. Security all around so you will feel safe anywhere in the area.

I expected 4-star treatment, but was a little worried after reading some comments by others about the hotel staff. Perhaps because we arrived at 9pm and didn't have to compete with others trying to register, we started off on the right foot with a wonderful check-in experience, that pretty much signaled what we got for the duration of our week there. The hotel was not booked to capacity, so maybe that helped, but we had nothing but the best kind of customer service from all the staff there, from the doormen, who had great suggestions for outings and restaurants, to the people who hand out the towels by the pool. Everyone speaks English really well, and their can-do attitudes and warmth really made us feel at home instantly. The room was nothing fancy but extremely clean and up to date with furnishings/decor. Everything worked fine (hair dryer, TV, alarm clock) and our daily cleanup was done to perfection. We especially liked our view -- 11th floor oceanview and our little balcony. The comments I'd read about the seaweed on the beach turned out to be not true. A little dried up seaweed accumulates along the tide line every day but the hotel has a vehicle that sweeps it out every day. The beach is beautiful and clean and so close to the pool, and the watertemp was perfect. Likewise, the pool is wonderful, clean and not too crowded, and open 24 hours. Going down to the pool, and using the outdoor Jacuzzi, each night, became a favorite activity. The fitness area is small but well-equipped, and there was no competition for the equipment. Never used the casino, but enjoyed watching Celtics playoff games in the bar nearby. We took the advice of many to avoid eating at the hotel and saved a LOT of money. We had either a breakfast or a lunch at our favorite place: Mi Casita, just across the street from the hotel. FAST and courteous service, delicious Puerto Rican style meals at very reasonable cost. You MUST try the local specialty, Mofongos (an odd but delicious concoction of beef or chicken tucked inside a pulverized plaintain mound, with a great sauce) , and the shrimp Asapao (soup) there. We walked the 10 minutes to the local Pueblo supermarket to stock up on yogurts, orange juice, and fruit, which we stored in our room fridge. Great supermarket -- clean and well-stocked. We saved a lot of money this way and it kept us from overeating! We used taxis several times to get around and then rented a car from Avis (agent at the hotel lobby) for two days, which was perfect. We used it to get to El Yunque rainforest and a beautiful almost deserted beach at Luquillo, as well as to the Plaza Los Americas (a huge shopping mall, like every other U.S. mall) -- we were traveling with a teenage daughter, and that was a small concession to make. The car also allowed us to get to some restaurants away from the tourist centers. We especially liked driving to the \"strip\" of eateries in Carolina, along the beach, (just 10 minutes from the hotel) to taste the local food: try lunch or dinner at Soleil. Dinner at Atlantica was very nice (fresh fish), and Lupi's, a block from the hotel, is easy, fast, cheap Mexican in a sports bar environment. The weather was beautiful until the day we had to leave -- how perfect is that? We left in a rain shower. Overall, there was absolutely nothing to mar our 6-day experience in San Juan, and we returned home rested, relaxed and feeling good about Puerto Rico overall and our Intercontinental hotel experience.", "Date": "April 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bolton, CT", "Title": "\u201cNice weekend at the Intercontinental\u201d", "Author": "dash1_98", "ReviewID": "UR28888898", "Content": "My wife and I took a long weekend at the Intercontinental.

I guess I should start by saying that we had a good stay at the Intercontinental overall. The reason why I gave it a 3 is because the services and accommodations did not quite rise to what we thought were solid four star accommodations. Actually, 3.5 stars is probably the best way to describe the IC in our opinion. 1) Accommodations/Amenities- Like many of the other posts have already stated the front desk has serious issues. The long lines upon check-in were the direct result of poor management. There were enough representatives at the check-in lines to have minimal wait at the front desk. Instead, the weight was 30+ minutes and the lines had only a few people in them. We decided to pay the extra $150 for an upgrade to an Ocean view room; I love to the look at the ocean when I wake up in the morning. When we got to the room (8th floor), it was horrible. Hardly an ocean view (could barely see the ocean); it was more of a rooftop view. 2) Restaurants- We love to dine and do not mind paying if the food is good, but the prices at the IC was over-priced with no justification. For example, while we were waiting for our room we had lunch at the beachfront caf\u00c3\u00a9. We spent $40 dollars for 2 sandwiches and 2 cokes (no drinks). The food was mediocre at best. To their credit, however, the Splash bar (near the pool) had much better food and at better prices. There were so many restaurants in the area that it makes no sense to eat on the resort. The concierge gave us excellent dining recommendations and we enjoyed dining around the town and in Old San Juan. 3) Beach/Pool- Both the beach and the pool were pretty nice. The pool was nice, but small, and the beach was wide, but not as blue and pristine as other Caribbean destination. But all-in all we enjoyed them both. 4) Casino- we are not really gamblers, but it was cool to have a casino on premises. We also went next door to El San Juan where their lobby was awesome, including a live salsa band. They also had a casino on premises. I recommend taking a visit. 5) Overall- Despite a few mishaps, we did enjoy our trip. Most vacations are what you make them.

Out of the two, La Concha was a prettier hotel. but the IC had much more action and was on a nicer beach in a better area. We arrived at 12 and disappointed at the very long line to check in. When we did, I asked if we could be upgraded (meanign for free as there were empty rooms) and was politely told it would cost me. I passed. We had to wait for a call on our cell for an empty room. Big upset. We checked our luggage and walked around. The El San Juan hotel is next door, followed by the ESJ towers and then some eateries. We ended up at Lupis, like I bet a lot of tourists do, and it was terrible (see my review). What a tourist trap. We headed back to the hotel around 2:30 to find our room was ready (no call). It was on the top floor - 1629 - and facing the street. But it was a great view and I am glad I didn't pay for an upgrade. The room has a lot of earth tones in it - and it very comfy (big sofas, chairs, fluffy bedding, lots of pillows). The tv is a CRT and the the cable would get staticky when the the TV was angled toward the bed. There was no HBO, even though it was on the channel list. The balcony lock was broken, but there was a security bar (and no way for anyone to get up that high anyways). The bathroom was nice and had a tub. We were very disappointed to find out Ruth's Chris is closed. They are renovating it. Which reminds me, the femal concierge with short brown hair is awful. She gave out lousy advice, if any. I witnessed her tell people that there was nowhere to shop nearby, there were no shows in Old San Juan (We walked by one), etc. We ate at every other eatery here though, Momoyama is Japanese and just okay. Very overpriced. Alfredo's is excellent and romantic. The splash bar had good wings for around $9 but there drinks were $10. I ordered a Miami Vice and got one sip of alcohol. Be warned. The mediterranean cafe (beachside grill) had an awesome quesadilla. The pool is awesome here. It is big and windy and has a bridge, a whirpool, rock waterfalls, etc. There are chairs all around, but we often had to work to find 2 together. Lots of people leave there towels on them and disappear. If i just saw a towel, I got rid of it. Sorry! Had to do it. This is a very kid friendly hotel (we left ours at home and were enjoying our first trip alone). Unfortunately, people were allowed to throw balls in the pool, which took up way too much space. Kids were given water guns too. The worst - my biggest complaint to the managers: ENFORCE THE NO KIDS IN THE HOTTUB RULE. It was posted that no kids under 12 were allowed yet it was kid heaven. Kids everywhere, and I mean from 7-12 years. Some with parents and many without. It was not relaxing at all!! You also had to wear a wristband at the pool, which was a joke as you were only given one at the towel hut and could easily walk right by it. Most people came from the beach into the pool area without them too. There were chairs on the beach, but they begin taking those away before 6:30. We were kicked out of our chairs very rudely at 6:20 when we were watching the sunset. It made me mad that they came to us first when there were plenty of empty chairs. You are not allowed on the beach by the hotel after 7. Not fair. The beach of Isla Verde is very nice. Soft whitish sand. No seashells whatsoever though (unfortunately) and way too much seaweed. The hotel should rake this up and help remove it from the water. To get to the water you had to wade past A LOT of seaweed. Then you were in clear water. But you had to come back through the seaweed again. For the huge resort fee were spending (14%), they should help with this. You can walk the beach far in both directions. But you cannot walk it to the Ritz,which was not clear based on the map on tripadvisor. You would have to leave to the street, walk down some way, then enter through the ritz. There are jetskis and kayaks for rental down the beach. You can get a surf lesson but there was no surf! The casino is small. The hotel smells great because of a scented oil they put out.

Renting a car was a great idea because we got to explore San Juan. We went out of the hotel to get a taste of Spanish food..Yum.Theyre are restauraunts up and down the block Oh and Old San Juan was really fun. Lots to do, historical sites, and places to shop.

I contacted several managers at the hotel and got nowhere. They refused to give me any credit or any consideration for our situation. Yahoo travel was also unsucessful in negotiating. I had to add two days extra at my own expense. I'm not happy that the hotel refused to credit me those lost 2 days even though it was due to weather circumstances beyond my control. Also, when I added the additional 2 days, no one let me know that I would be charged 2.5 times the resort fee due to the higher room rates. I paid $41/day for the \"resort fees\" for the additional 2 days as opposed to $18/day \"resort fee\" I was charged for the first 3 days.

This first time I had a very nice trip and was very impressed with the hotel. This time around, I had a horrible experience that will cause me to never return to this hotel or any other Intercontinental hotel anywhere. I arrived at the hotel around 1 PM and went to check in. I was told that my room wasnt ready and that they would call me on my cell when it was ready. I was fine with that and my wife and I decided to go have lunch and walk around.. We got our room, relaxed for a while and then went to have dinner. After dinner my wife went to the slot machines and I went to the Carribean stud poker table. I sat down, and immediately I noticed that the dealer was coughing and sneezing all over the cards. The pit boss was standing there and did absolutely nothing. It was disgusting. I stayed maybe 4 or 5 hands and was done. Nothing was being done, and I was angry. When I went to my wife right after I got up and told her what happened, she told me she saw one of the waiters coughing and sneezing also. Needless to say, the next morning I had a cold and sore throat., and soon after my wife was sick as well. Our trip was ruined. We were miserable. Upon checkout, the manager asked how my trip was, and when I explained to him what happened, he told me that the hotel was a separate entity from the casino and that there was nothing he could do for me. He walked me over to the casino manager and when I explained to him what happened, he shrugged his shoulders like he didnt care. I asked why the pit boss would allow a sick dealer to work the tables and he said,\"What am I supposed to do, I cant send a dealer home with just a cold\" He said I couldnt prove that the dealer got me sick. I was dumbfounded. The hotel manager did nothing and the casino manager didnt care. In this economy, this is the kind of customer service that cause people to go elsewhere. When I got home, I called the hotel 800 number customer service to explain what happened, They said someone would get back to me in 48 hours. Well 7 days later, no call. I called on the 8th day, and they said I would get a call back that day or the next. That didnt happen either. I called back again, and was told that customer service the for hotel cant help me because the casino and the hotel are 2 separate businesses and have nothing to do with each other despite the website being one(Intercontinental hotel and casino). They told me, Id have to speak to the casino on my own. I said I did that upon checkout and got nowhere and that to do it again would be pointless. They said, then the matter is closed. I said that I paid them for my trip, not the casino, and they said it wasnt the hotels fault I got sick. So I got nowhere, but learned a valuable lesson. The Intercontinental Hotel customer service is the worst customer service I have ever seen. I paid THEM for my trip, but they did not provide me with a safe environment. Be aware that the hotel and the casino are separate, and the hotel does not care what happens in the casino. I was treated rudely, by the hotel, by the casino, and by the hotels 800 number customer service. I will never stay at any Intercontinental hotel anywhere ever again. It is apparant that the casino managemt does not care if their employees come in sick and get customers sick, and that the hotel doesnt care if THEIR customers get sick either.

I give it 4 stars on everything... but to be honest, I expected a little bit more for an Intercontinental. They didn't go that extra mile to get the 5 stars. A few great tips: - The hotel restaurants are very pricey and the food isn't so great. After a couple days, we went off the hotel for our meals. Lots of options nearby such as Denny's, Starbucks, Subway, etc. I reccomend you go into Old San Juan if you want to experience local food. - Across the street and around a corner is a big supermarket and US Post Office. Ask the door-man for directions. - There is a cockfighting arena nearby if you dare. Yes, its legal in PR. Also a restaurant next to the arena that I hear is great (never been there). - Visit the neighbor hotel called the \"San Juan\". It is awesome! An amazingly beautiful lobby with live music almost every night. It is a local hot spot and everyone goes there for dinner, drinks and dancing. The lobby is packed with revelers on the weekend. And there is also a bar on the roof of the hotel (never been there). - Be aware that customer service in Puerto Rico is not the same as in the USA. Be prepared to wait. And be prepared for them to forget your order, etc. I call it \"island service\" and deal with it. No point in getter overheated while you are on vacation! - Splurge on the guided trip to the rainforest and hike to the waterfall. It cost $64 per person when booked at the hotel concierge. It is well worth getting off the hotel and seeing and learning about the real PR. - Instead of a $25 taxi into Old San Juan, try the local bus. Its fun and you'll get to see more of the real Puerto Rico. Its only 75 cents (need exact change). It is the A9 (or A5?) and the C53 bus. The bus stop is right outside the hotel (ask a hotel door-man for info), and Old San Juan is the last stop. For safety reasons, you might want to take a taxi after dark, though. - Be careful in Old San Juan at night. Probably not dangerous.

Service is outstanding\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhelpful and informative. For instance, when stepping out front to hail a taxi, the doorman inquired where we were going (Old San Juan), and then gave us a brochure, map and a few tips while the cab pulled up. Other encounters with bellhops, waiters, concierge, pool attendants, etc. were uniformly pleasant. The pool area and beach are beautiful, and the hotel provides free towels, chairs and an umbrella, which an attendant carefully plants in holes dug for both the pole and an anchor rope. The beach is wide and very smooth\u00e2\u20ac\u201dno shells, rocks, coral, etc., thus it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great for swimming and sunning. Large pool, hot tub and health club were very clean and well-maintained. Attendants are ever- present and constantly tidying up. The highlight of our vacation was a day-long snorkeling trip on the Spread Eagle II, costing $90 per person, reserved by the concierge. A comfortable bus picked up us and a few others at 8:30 a.m. for an hour-long ride to a marina at the northeastern tip of Puerto Rico. At 10 a.m. we boarded the 50-foot catamaran with 16 other customers and three crewmembers for an hour-long sail to Icacos Island. All snorkeling equipment was provided, and the engaging captain gave me and some other beginners a lesson before we entered the water (floats are also available). There were about five kids under 10 or 11, and adults of all ages and aquatic abilities. After the first snorkeling stop at a shallow beach, the all-you-can eat buffet lunch of sandwiches and salads was ready (included in the price as are drinks and snacks all day). Then the boat moved to deeper water near a coral reef where dense schools of fish nibbled at bread we fed them. Two other snorkeling boats anchored in the same places on the same schedule and the three boats raced home under full sail when all departed about 3:30 p.m. Even if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to snorkel, this enjoyable sail and great views would be well worth the money. As noted elsewhere, the hotel food is expensive but excellent. We passed on the $17 continental breakfast buffet and $22 full breakfast in favor of the bagel place in the shopping center across the street, where you can eat any breakfast foods there or take out. The fridge in our room helped hold down costs with our own drinks and snacks. Mi Casita in the shopping center is a good inexpensive option. J.H. Yee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Asian Bistro restaurant two blocks away also is excellent and reasonably priced (try the Genghis Khan beef). Turn right out the front door, then left at the first street to the Holiday Inn. This also is a quicker route to the large Pueblo supermarket (pass the Holiday Inn and Embassy Suites and bear to the left). We did have a great dinner at Intercontinental\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alfredo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, where you get a complimentary glass of champagne and hors d'oeuvres (but adding some chicken to the Fettucine Alfredo costs $10). However our best meal was the high-end Koco Caribbean in the El San Juan Hotel next door. You can assemble \u00e2\u20ac\u0153small plates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and entrees to share\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe braised beef short ribs are absolutely fantastic; the crab cakes, coconut shrimp and fish taquidos also memorable. A taxi to Old San Juan was $19 plus tip one way. Taxi to El Morro fort at the west end, the highest point, then afterwards walk into town to shop. We ate at La Bombonera, 259 Calle San Francisco, for authentic local food (roasted pork, friend plantains). Then finish with Fort San Cristobal if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re up for another fort with great views and lots of tunnels, lookouts and stairs to climb on. At the eastern end near San Cristobal is Plaza Colon, where there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a taxi stand. If you go to the forts, keep an eye on little kids\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere are lots of sheer drops off the stone walls. Our room on the 11th floor, city side, was well-furnished, clean and everything worked fine. The beds were extremely plush and comfortable. Although we were not bothered by any noisy neighbors, we could tell the hotel walls are not well soundproofed, so that may bother light sleepers or those near loud guests. The air conditioner was generally quiet, but did have a sporadic rattle that kept me awake a bit. But the pillows were large and soft enough that I could easily wrap it around my head to block any sound. There is occasional airplane noise but it was infrequent and not bothersome.

(Marriott, esj, and Embassy suites are all wonderful) I booked my husband and I here for the first 4 nights of our honeymoon before we caught a princess cruise to eastern Caribbean. First glance, I loved it, it was gorgeous, friendly staff and nice restaurants. It stopped there: beware of an extra 22% hotel tax they tack onto your bill on that \"credit card for incidentals\" I have never had to pay this at any of the other hotels. I pre-paid everything this vacation with priceline, so I was perturbed at this. Beyond that minor aggravation, a fire alarm went off two nights in a row at 1:40 and 3 am. I can understand one night having an accident in the kitchen, but two? Beyond that, the manager of the hotel had no idea that the first night it had gone off, he said, \"oh, it must have been a floor alarm that someone on your floor tripped.\" But that he had no information on it and oh well. I\"m a very light sleeper and being woken from dead sleep to a very loud siren and loud booming voice saying \"a fire has been detected in the building\" was not my idea of a nice honeymoon. Ok, beyond these two obstacles, we decided to book an excursion on the island. The concierge was very helpful and we decided to take one (mind you very expensive one) that took us to El Yunque, Luquillo beach, and Bioluminescent bay. I had heard great things about the first and last, but never luquillo. I asked the concierge and he said OH its wonderful, best beach on the island, so we went ahead. The rainforest was nice, but when the van dropped us off at the beach and told us they'd be back in 3 hours, we were a little freaked out. We couldn't see the beach from the parking lot so before the van drove away, the guide told us he'd pick us up at the food shacks a half mile down the road at 6pm. Passing them on the way in, it looked like the worst part of the barrio, so we decided we better stay on the beach as long as possible. The van drove away and we walked towards the beach. As soon as we got 10 steps further (of course the van was long gone by then) we saw homeless people sleeping on the beach which was littered with trash and bugs. A few people were swimming but the water looked a little of a weird color--I\"m from new jersey and even our beaches didn't look that gross. So of course with every disaster of a honeymoon, the clouds darkened for a storm so we were forced to walk to the barrio food shacks. On the way we noticed a nice large river of raw sewage (yes it was for sure as it smelled like it as well) that flowed right into the beach. (we're talking raw sewage into a beach 0.25 miles from the center of the beach) So in the barrio, we were like sitting ducks, we might as well had a target on us, so we spent the 2.5 hours left in the corner of one of the shacks playing pool and trying to generously tip the people at that food stand in hopes we wouldn't be shot or mugged. Finally we got picked up and were brought to Bioluminescent bay in Fajardo. It was nice, but since it was still storming it was a bit short and they didn't let us swim in the water, just kayaked 40 mins round trip to shake our hands in the water and return to the shore. Afterwards, talking to other people on the island, they said the best place to see Biobay is in Vieques (an island off the eastern coast). I give this background because the concierge at the hotel is the one that put us on this. We asked a few cab drivers that they get for you at the hotel and they all say Luquillo is their favorite beach, but any taxi driver not around that hotel will tell you culebra or some others on the western side or southern part of the island..... suspicious, to us it seemed they were all in coohoots. OK so when we went to check out, we asked the manager about this, and he told us, look it up online, its a wonderful beach! I said I dont care what it said online, we've been there and seen the area, seen the sewage and contamination, and its crazy they keep sending people there. He didn't seem to care, so great if he likes swimming in raw sewage (which is where I'd like to dunk him now), I just advise the rest of you dont. :) So to not ruin your vacation or honeymoon, this is a beautiful hotel, but I'd advise stay in The Embassy Suites (free hot breakfast and free happy 2 hours) or El San Juan and with either you can walk to Ruth's Chris steakhouse or any Intercontinental amenities.", "Date": "November 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Rapids, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cMy Favorite Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Rwinks685", "ReviewID": "UR21851325", "Content": "This hotel is one of the best I have stayed at.

The hotel room itself was great. I didn't find it small at all (could that be because we just came off of a week on a cruise ship???). There was a vanity right outside the bathroom which was perfect for hair and makeup and best of all - the lighting was good for doing your makeup! (Women can relate to this issue!).

We got the continental breakfast in the lobby each morning and took it down to the beach, which was great. The coffee in the lobby is so good!

Just be sure to ask for a room overlooking the pool and ocean, since the view on the other side is not so great.

If you are looking for a relaxing atmosphere without the big crowds (low season), this is the place to go. The hotel has an elegant flair and they try to make it feel as luxurious as possible, don't expect Ritz Carlton level and you will not be dissapointed. The hotel: Same as everyone else says : nice people, slow front desk, helpful when needed and always opening doors. As far as the food at the hotel, we only ate there once and it was good but pricey, $48.00 for lunch that consisted of a burger, a sandwich and two drinks, ouch. Stay away from the drinks at the beach bar, we ended up ordering two $15 drinks that were not even that great or strong or big. Check with the waiter about the prices before you order because they don't list them on the menu. The rooms: Nice and clean, not imaculate but clean. The bed was soft and plushy, super comfortable. We also upgraded to ocean view and it really is worth the money. We were greeted with wine and strawberries for my B-day which is always nice. The beach: We read that the beach in Isla Verde is nothing compared to the not so touristy beaches that PR offers, so we didn't know what to expect. When we finally checked in, ( that took a really long time) we headed to the beach and it was beautiful. Blue, calm and just what we needed. There were maybe 8 other couples on the beach, so it felt very private. It was quiet, and so relaxing. The beach alone is worth the trip. We opted to rent a car, and I would say that if you are planning to do some exploring you have to rent a car. It is very easy to get everywhere and the freedom you get to leave when you want and go whenever and wherever you want to go is awesome. So, unless you are not moving from the hotel, rent a car, it is worth it and cheaper. I definetaly agree with the fact that organized tours are not worth your money. We explored so much, Luquillo beach, the rainforest, Old san juan, Pinones on Sunday when all the locals go (fun and very PR, if you want to sample local food, brace yourself and eat). The only tour I highly recommend is the Vieques Bioluminecent tour. East Island Excursions is the only company that can arrange a night trip and bring you back to Fajardo, which is a 20-30 minute drive from Isla Verde. I will do it again in a heart beat. To read more about it, go to puertoricodaytrips.com. Don't forget to schedule your tour according to the what phase the moon is in. The biobay is best experienced on cloudy, moonless nights. Food: Well, I guess this is the only down side of our trip. We are very adventurous when it comes to food and we were looking forward to trying the local fare. Unfortunately, most of it didn't agree with me, lots of fried and super fried foods. But that is just me. We ate at Mi Casita one night and it was good, we also tried Pamela's for my actual b-day dinner, and even though that was pricey, about $200.00 for two with drinks, it was so yummy. I am definetaly coming back with the kids, the hotel's pool is awesome and beach access steps away.

The Hotel: My first impression was that the hotel was very nice. It is centrally located in relation to popular tourist attractions (Old San Juan and El Yunque Rainforest). It is right on a beatiful beach. The lobby is quite small and not much going on. If you are looking for action the El San Juan is right next door. Overall, the pool and the lobby is much nicer at the El San Juan but for a family, couples, a relaxing vacation or elderly people, the Intercontinental is a better choice as it is much quieter and well lit. The El San Juan is very trendy, dark and loud (think night club) - but if you are single and younger (under 35) the El San Juan is a better choice. The Room: I originally upgraded to a room with an ocean view but when I got to my room on the 7th floor I noticed that most of the view was obstructed by trees. I immediately called the front desk and they gladly changed rooms to the 14th floor...that view was SPECTACULAR!!! Moral of the story - make sure you call for a higher floor because \"ocean view\" is pretty much anything on the side of the hotel that faces the ocean...it doesn't necessarily mean that you can see the ocean LOL! My only complaint was that the walls were paper-thin and you can easily hear people in the next room and it can be hard to sleep at night if you have loud neighbors. I had to call security all 3 nights I was there - it's not the hotel's fault that these people were really loud but just keep in mind that the walls are thin. The Hotel Staff: The staff is extremely courteous (much more than at the El San Juan). There was always someone to open the doors to the hotel for you no matter what time you entered or exited the hotel (and they never asked or expected a tip). The concierge was very nice and helpful as well. My only complaint was that the service at the front desk was a bit slow. House keeping was very quiet when cleaning other rooms- they were like ninjas - you dind't even know they were there. I left my room for breakfast, put the sign on my door to get my room cleaned...came back 45min later and my entire room was clean. Rental Car / PARKING!!!! : This was the best part for me...right accross the street is a self-parking area...it costs $16 per day and you can go in and out AS MUCH AS YOU PLEASE! This is such an advantage if you are doing any sightseeing. DO NOT waste money on organized tours...all the signs in San Juan are in English and easy to follow. Rent a car and you will save yourself a TON on money (including a $15 cab trip each way to and from the airport). I reserved a car from the airport on priceline.com for $15/day tax inc.!!!! That's $93 for a 4-day, 3-night weekend for parking and the car - You can't beat that! Old San Juan and the Bacardi factory are 15min by car and the rainforest is 45min away. If you take an organized tour this will cost you at least a couple of hundred dollars per person...for something that can easily be done on your own! However, make sure you bring a GPS - it will really come in handy - if you don't have one, most rental car companies can offer you one at a marginal rate. RENT A CAR, RENT A CAR, RENT A CAR!!!! Where to eat: Right across from the hotel there are tons of restaurants (Burger King, Pizza Hut, Wendy's, Subway, KFC...). My suggestion would be \"Mi Casita\" it is fairly authentic and relatively inexpensive and the food is good...BUT BEWARE the service can be long. I have eaten at this restaurant 5 times, dinner usually takes at least 45min for you to get your food and breakfast is around 25-30min. However, the last day we were there, dinner came out in 15min and breakfast came out in 10min...so I would say it's hit or miss but prepare for the worst. Don't go when you are extremely hungry because chances are you will wait a while. Try their Signature Mofongo dishes (mashed plantain topped with a tomato based sauce and your choice of chicken/beef/shrimp.) Overall, the wait is worth it - both for the quality of the food and especially the price. If you eat at any of the hotels, don't expect to get out of there for under $100 for 2 people (wine not included). Another option, is there is a grocery store within 5min walking distance from the hotel - you can't see it, so ask the concierge how to get to the \"Pueblo\" grocery store. There you can buy water, drinks, and even prepared food for dirt cheap prices. Also, there is a Walgreens 5min walking distance as well. Beach: The beach is very nice but can be crowded in peak seasons. It is a long beach - I'd say at least 5 miles. The sand is groomed every morning. The water can get rough if there is bad weather but generally, it is really good. The good thing about this hotel is that the beach chairs are free. Some other hotels charge $4/day for beach chairs! Things to do: If you like booze, the Bacardi Factory is nearby, you can go on a tour once you get there with your rental car =) Old San Juan is beautiful - make sure to bring a camera. There are a few old forts that can be visted that will give you a great view of the ocean and the city as well as a history of the island. Also, there is a path that you can walk on right by the ocean that takes you all along Old San Juan. El Yunque rainforest: This is a must! Take your rental car and drive to the rainforest; there are many well marked trails that are paved. You do not need a guide or to go on a tour. If you go by yourself - it's FREE!!!! All you have to do is print out a trail map from the internet first. On my first trip in 2005, I went on a tour that cost me $60...we walked for an hour and we were done. This time I did some research and did the La Mina trail and the Big Tree trail and that was amazing - nothing like what the tours take you on...breath-taking scenery and a gorgeous waterfall at the bottom. The rainforest opens at 7:30am; if you start hiking before 8:30am you will be fine otherwise expect crowds, especially at La Mina Falls. Both trails I took were about 40min of hiking...the La Mina trail is MUCH nicer than the Big Tree trail but it is also a bit harder to do. If you are in any decent shape, I suggest the La Mina trail down to the falls and the Big Tree trail back up. I hope this helps you out, I really love Puerto Rico and it is clear why it is called \"La Isla Del Encanto\". I am set to go back in May and visit Culebra, home to Flamenco Beach - rated by Discovery Channel as one of the nicest beaches in the world.

They did show family movies every day at 5:00 p.m. The pool was beautiful, the staff amazingly friendly, beach clean and lovely. I do prefer the Caribbean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean but Intercontinental can't do anything about that. LOL The casino was fun- as mentioned, free food and drinks while gambling. Old San Juan was great shopping and beautiful. Will definitely be back, but beware as hotels everywhere, the food and drink prices were high.

The staff was so personal and friendly, the grounds were beautiful, everything was clean...it was spectacular! Of course a couple tips... *Grocery shop ASAP! Every room has a mini fridge. Pueblo (local grocery) is a short walk. We got breakfast snacks, alcohol, mixers, snacks, water bottles, sunscreen, etc. The food and drinks at the hotel were great, but pricey. Grocery! *Book snorkel trip with Castillo Tours (castillotours.com) to Icacos. BEAUTIFUL and FUN! Good day trip. Plenty of time for evening plans. Ask for a tour with Tito & Crew. They brought us Pina Coladas in the water! Service. So much fun and SO professional! *Salsa dancing next door at the El San Juan! Hot sopt for San Juan and DEFINATELY the best dancing we encountered. *Eat at Platos!!! 5 min walk down the street. Get the fried plantain and Mahi Mahi...delicious! *Massages at the Spa were a perfect conclusion to our trip. They were so relaxing. Definately choose this hotel!!!!

We didnt have to wait too long to check in and we upgraded to a ocean front room for $150 extra. Here is my honest review: When I saw our ocean front room I was shocked by how much they charge regular price for it. There were tons of ants in the bathroom. I had to call housekeeping a couple of times to spray the bathroom. There was mold everywhere. Rooms are dingy. Old carpets. Old furniture. I would never pay full price for this room. The actual hotel grounds were ok. Pool was clean. The Beach was AMAZING. The water was perfect and the sand clean, hardly any rocks. We really got to relax. I must also point out that we visited during Peak Hurricane Season so there were hardly any people staying at the hotel. Next to the pool, there must have been 10 people the entire week. If your'e going during high season, the pool area is pretty small and I can see it crowding really easily. The food at the hotel was BLAH. You're better off going across the street to Mi Casita for breakfast (will cost you $15.00 rather than $50.00 at the hotel). Dinners are VERY expensive. We spent an average of $140 every night just for dinner. Lunch runs about $45.00 for two people - and we dont eat a lot. So food is extremely pricey unless you want to eat fried fast food for the week. Wendy's Burger King, KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, all across the street. We ate mostly at the El San Juan Hotel. That hotel looked absolutely beautiful. Food was amazing at Koco, The Palm and Yamato. If I was to go back to San Juan, I would probably try staying at the El San Juan. It was way more modern than the Intercontinental. Overall, unless you are getting a GREAT deal at this hotel, I would recommend choosing another one.

Beautiful plants and trees everywhere. even though this is part of the United States, spanish is their language. although once they realize you speak english they will switch to english. I must agree everyone was polite and friendly, very warm people. I would recommend that you rent a car even if you are staying a few days and plan to sight see, I rented one from avis at the airport total was $202. US dollars including all insurance, gas refill, rental on a gps (garmin) map device and fast easy return drop off. it saved me money compared to all the other tourist who spent lots more just getting around to a few of the tourist sites. I was able to see so much more of the city and surrounding area. able to go the many more tourist sites ( I would Plan out the places i would want to go to first though). and when needed went to the grocery store, target, and was so very convenient. traffice not to bad pretty much like everywhere else, all signs are in spanish, be careful of Rush hour although people are nice and let you move over, Just the cab ride from the airport which is less than 3 miles away is $21. Because the cab drivers know that this is a high price hotel they will charge you more. parking is scarce so it is worth paying the $16 dollar fee to the hotel to park across the street in their lot with in an out priviledges. A car rental is something i would recommend you splurge on, the hotel is right next to the old san juan hotel that has a starbucks in their lobby, about 12 blocks further down is the ritz carlton hotel. ok now the intercontinental is an older hotel (as are all the other hotels in this area) that has been remolded but it very nice and kept up. the landscaping is very green, very large pool mostly 3 ft deep with one 5x5 roped off section that is 6 ft. has waterfalls as part of the pool and a very large hot tub, swim up bar, lots of padded loungers to lay out and get some sun. in your room you change into your swim clothes and take the elevator to the lower lobby where you exit to the courtyard go to the hut by the pool to get a wristband that identifies you as a hotel guest. Large free towels are provided, as you walk toward the beach you will pass the hotels spa on the right and then the bathroom area that is provided along with outdoor shower to wash off any sand upon return. Just before you exit the hotel pool area a restaurant bar Splash is there for drinks or food. the hotel provides free lounges which they will carry and set up for you so you can sun by the ocean. 30 feet away is the ocean and it is Beautiful, i can not stress this enough, the sand is clean, cream colored and warm to your feet, the ocean water is clear and warm, just beautiful. I noticed that there was a shark net way out set up by the hotel so guest need not worry about being bothered while in the ocean. so you can forget about all those shark movies and just enjoy the beautiful ocean water. There were no life guards so be careful any undercurrent pull i felt was very slight and i do not know how to swim so i kept near the shoreline. this part of the beach is owned by the hotel, it is kept up and very clean, hotel waiters walk around to bring you drinks or anything you may need. there are also locals selling food, ice cream, and hats and jewelry but not to many to bother you. even on weekends this part of the beach is not crowed since it is not a public beach area. there are also vendors who provide jet skis for rent, a banana boat ride (where you ride on a catamaran style boat that is being pulled by a larger boat and hang on while the banana boat your on bounces and splashes in the ocean) also they provide parasailing where you are attached to a parachute and also pulled by a boat so that you soar in the air. Life jackets are provided and rates are posted so take some money with you if you want drinks, food, or to purchase the rides. miles of great beach if you want an early morning run which i did see people taking advantage of, sunset walks, or just a walk along the shore with the waves tickling your toes. not much to see though since there is only the back of condos and other hotels to see. ok back to the hotel, had a nice clean comfortable room, large king bed, 40 inch flat screen tv, mini fridge was empty so i put my own vitamin waters and snacks in it. small 3 ft balcony to stand from and take in the view. beautiful ocean view, housekeeping was great very attentive and polite. hotels have small casinos, nothing like vegas, but if you like to gamble they will serve your needs, free drinks and cocktails and food snacks from the casino waitstaff. Mostly slots with a few tables for blackjack, texas holdem, roulette, 3 card and carribean poker and craps. can be a fun night, upon check in ask your clerk for casino coupons if you want to gamble. also they have a lottery you have to buy tickets at any convience store and the concierge can look up the winning numbers upon request. on weekends in the main lobby bar free music is provided salsa to move your feet too. they also take request, man those people can swivel their hips. wow! there are many walgreens drug stores within walking distance and fast food places right across the street. ok now for food hotel has great restaurants, ruth chris, yokomama, and italian and also one for american food. Denny's and walgreens drug store are 8 blocks up toward the ritz carlton in the very little isla mall, for a great american breakfast or food 24 hours. they don't have late brunch anywhere so if you want breakfast after 11am this is the place to go. a local restuarant Mi casita is right across the street for local puerto rican food and it is great but pricey. used to be cheap but now entree's run from $ 8 to $20, but they give you a lot so maybe you can share, when i ate there i had to take half home all the time. baskin robbins ice cream is right next door. just remember when standing in front of the hotel intercontinental facing the street, fast food across the street and to the right, to the left Starbucks (in old san juan hotel lobby) denny's, walgreens, Chili's( open in November 2008) to your left all within walking distance. Well hope you have a great trip in puerto rico, lots to see and do, take advantage. although i did see and do what i wanted i went with the purpose to disconnect from all cell phones, email, and everything else. i did completely relax and spent most of my time on the beach and in the beautiful ocean, and getting some sun. I will return for a much longer visit. I hope this trip will do you as much good as it did me, just remember ---- relax, relax, relax, unwind, let the ocean waters wash all your cares away. walk on the beach at sunset and fall in love again, even if it is just with yourself. peace. sincerely charlie", "Date": "September 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cThe Intercontinental Rocks!\u201d", "Author": "LauraTheExplorerNyc", "ReviewID": "UR20184974", "Content": "We had a room overlooking the beach.

Highlights: A very well kept and professionally landscaped pool area. Open 24-7. The beach is very well maintained also and only a few steps away. (The hotel is on the beach) Many excellent places to eat at the hotel and plenty of more affordable eateries within a very short walk. Excellent service in every area. Clean rooms - clean hotel. Very adequate fitness center. Spa appeared to be adequate although we never used the services. The hotel even set up a large screen television and showed family movies each night -with free water and popcorn for the kids. Concierge service was very helpful with maps and driving directions and bus information etc. (tour info too - although we preferred to go it on our own - mostly). There is an Avis car rental at the hotel. We used the free wireless internet to make our auto reservation, taking advantage of discounts. Service was very good there as well. We had excellent service without exception. We had a very safe and enjoyable time! We booked at this time of year to have a relaxing vacation during a \"slow\" time. Our goal was to relax, take it easy and not try to do too much. We made no firm plans - other than the flights and hotel - but had a few activities in mind, if we felt like it. We stayed five nights beginning September 8th. The taxi ride from the airport was very short($11.50 plus $1 per bag). Check in was smooth and timely. The representative did advise us, however, that there was a apx $10 per night service fee that was not collected by \"Priceline\" that would be collected a check-out. There were no other suprises. Being \"Priority Club\" members we asked to upgrade to an ocean front view room. After declining to purchase the upgrade we were upgraded free of charge. The view was wonderful! The restaurants at the hotel are top notch, steakhouse (Ruth's Chris), Japanese (MomoYama) and Italian. There is a pool bar and a restaurant/ bar with a large deck right on the beach. The restaurants, and \"pool drinks\" can become pricey fast. No worry, there is a small market across the street and Walgreens right down the street (either direction). And we had a mini fridge in the room! (which we stocked with bottled-water and diet Coke purchased outside the hotel) There are many affordable eateries all within a short walk: Mi Casita's (Local), Subway, Burger King, Wendy's, Church's, Lupi's (Mexican), Baskin-Robbins (ice cream), Taco Maker, Chinese ... We did eat one night at the Italian place at the hotel and had great food and service. We had the best of both worlds - We mainly went to the pool and beach each day ... and enjoyed the hot-tub each night. And we had the best of both worlds here too - pool and beach! Although we did not, there were Jetski rentals available on the beach by the resort next door. Although we brought our personal snorkle gear - we did not snorkle and I got the impression that for really \"good\" snorkling we would need to go elsewhere. Nevertheless, a great beach and water right outside your door! We did go to Old San Juan one half day. You can rent a car, take the city bus (easy and safe - just don't go late) or pay for a cab. We rented a car one day as well and drove to the National Park/ rainforest . (about 45 minutes drive - tops - use the toll road!) The conceirge and all the staff were very helpful with questions to help plan with these activities. Check-out was uneventful and prompt as well as the taxi to the airport.

I am SO HAPPY we stayed at the Intercontinental. I read some of the negative reviews and couldn't disagree more! We are already talking about going back! We arrived at noon on 9/10/08 and knew the check in time was 4pm. The desk clerk was very sweet and not only allowed us to check in early (no additional fee) but also upgraded us to a beautiful 7th floor room that faced the ocean. The room far exceeded our expectations. The king sized bed had a feather top and was extremely comfortable. We had a large flat screen TV too. The walls were painted a soothing light blue with tasteful art and a sofa, chair, and table. I loved our view from the balcony and enjoyed seeing it when we woke up in the morning. This is what a vacation should be! The pool area was large and mostly uncrowded. They provide a bracelet to wear in order to pick up towels and so you can get access to the connected beach. We were provided extra towels when we asked, although didn't really need them since they are more than adequate in size. The blue cushions on the lounge chairs made them extremely comfortable (be careful about falling asleep in the sun!). Another reviewer wrote that there was bird waste on the cushions but we didn't see too much of that (plus come on- we're outside!). We spent time in the jacuzzi and swimming under the 3 waterfalls, and visited the swim-up bar a few times too. The drinks were good (try the mojito) but expensive and a bit 'weak'. Some new friends told us to go to the bar closest to the beach and get the big 32 oz drinks (drink of choice: the yummy \"Voodoo\") to get our money's worth. We didn't order food at the pool area since it was a bit overpriced. For the most part, we ate our meals outside of the hotel since we like to try local food/restaurants. Mi Casita had excellent breakfast and dinner. The breakfast was inexpensive and filling (don't forget to order the potatoes!); our dinner was out of this world (I had the seafood paella and my husband had something they created for him). This is not fast food so you can't expect to get your food in 5 minutes! You should try Metropol for fabulous Cuban/Puerto Rican food (try Cuban fried pork, the grilled salmon, plantains, and definitely the black beans!). We went to Lupis for a casual dinner and loved the fajitas and beef enchiladas that we washed down with margaritas. We had a wonderful dinner at the hotel restaurant Momoyama on one night since we love sushi. We suggest the seafood tempura, spider roll, California roll ( or ANY of the sushi) and finish your meal with the guava cheesecake. The Manager came over a few times to check on us which was nice. The Concierge was more than helpful when we asked for suggestions. We took the rain forest tour and had a great time. The guide told us that it would be 7/10 of a mile but it was a lot longer with some steep hills/inclines which could be a bit slippery. Be sure to stretch before taking the tour and wear appropriate shoes/sneakers. We saw (huge) snails, birds, and plenty of lizards but not much other wildlife (such as snakes). We enjoyed seeing the beautiful lush scenery and waterfalls. The area near the main waterfall was a bit crowded and the water was cold but plenty of people enjoyed it. Be careful because the rocky terrain can hurt your feet- wear water shoes or sport sandals if going in near the waterfall! We rented a car from the hotel for the day (about $35) so we could explore a bit more (we didn't want to rent a car for the week since we didn't need it and parking at the hotel is $16/day). We went to Old San Juan and the huge Castillo San Felipe del Moro Fortress. We spent a lot of time on the beach since the water was so warm and a gorgeous blue hue. Dig your feet around a bit in the ocean and you might come up with some shells, coral, or sand dollars (be sure to wash, dry and bleach them after you get home). The on-site gym has all the machines or equipment you could want (or need?) to use. The ellipticals, bikes, and treadmills face the ocean and have tv screens built in. Everyone at the hotel was very helpful and courteous. Again, I hope you stay at the Intercontinental and enjoy yourselves as much as we did!

I love Puerto Rico (this was my 5th hotel stay in PR in a year and a half) and was thrilled to bring along a friend who hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been before. We chose the IC because we found a really great deal online. I had been in a lobby a few times and it seemed nice. I wasn't scared away by a few negative reviews on Tripadvisor, but perhaps I should I have been. We encountered cleanliness issues in our room, and service issues in general. To give some specifics, we encountered a dirty carpet full of dust bunnies under the furniture, hair left in the shower, mold in the bathroom, half-hearted daily housekeeping, and a soiled bathrobe. Room service screwed up in several ways (waking me up before 7 am to verify my order which I placed the night before, then getting the order wrong anyway, and serving it cold). Waiters at the pool literally never came by, though we did see them, so we would eventually give up and get our own food and drinks. It was frustrating, but Irene, the club manager, did set things right for us, comping the room service and adding a few other nice touches. So, while we encountered annoyances, all\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forgiven. She was extremely professional. Like most nearby resorts, they nickel and dime you; prepare to pay for everything. The best bet is to stock up on water, sunscreen, and snacks at the Walgreens right down the street. The gift shop has cheaper water than the bottles in the room if you need it. (FYI, there's no complimentary water in the gym except the old-fashioned communal water fountain; they will sell you a Gatorade for $3.) On the plus side, the hotel has a nice location on the beach, a good pool, a swim-up bar with great bartenders, and a decent gym. The waiter on the beach (not poolside) did come around often enough. The gentleman who sets up chairs and umbrellas on the beach, Jose, was very friendly. Because management took the time to hear my concerns and fix the problems, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give this place a less than three stars, though it's really more like a 2.5 out of 5. I wish I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to take time out of my stay to complain, which I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like to do. I think part of the problem may have been that it was a generally slow season but a busier holiday weekend, thus they may have had more people than the staff could handle. I also feel like the IC is an upscale chain, but this particular IC is not like other Intercontinentals. This IC thinks it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 4-star hotel but operates more like a 3-star. A better choice in the same price range is the Courtyard Marriot Isla Verde, which is not as fancy a hotel (no high end steakhouse, no opulent lobby) but absolutely excels in its class and has great service and better food. As for Ruth's Chris, I have now eaten there twice and am not impressed at all. You can get less awkward service and similar quality cooking at the Outback, but if you want to splurge, go the BLT Steak .

A resort fee at a resort that charges a fortune for water in your room, charges for everything. So not sure what the resort fee is for. My room was dated, worn, and torn. The furniture was very old rattan and wood. The french door with mirrors for the bathroom was very 1980. The A/C was loud and did not cool to well. Carpets where frayed, stained and torn. Not the room that you would expect at an Intercontinental Hotel. It was actually a Jr. Suite with a separate bedroom and living room. Old style box televisions and no mini-bar, no robes, no upgraded amenities. I faces the lagoon. My friend had a room facing the ocean (#820). Those rooms have plasma TV;s and upgraded furniture and bedding. But the rooms (mine was #821) with odd numbers that face the lagoon are old school. Make sure u make it clear ar check in that you want one of the newer rooms. Turndown service is a joke. Its not included automatically. You have to request it. All the do is come in and close curtains. That's it. No chocolate, no refreshing of room. no extra towels. Nothing. Why even offer turndown service if they are not going to do it the right way ?

You have to sign for it, get a bracelet, the whole thing is in convenient and more \"Cancun all inclusive $79 a night hotel\" then 5 star resort. I mean at almost $400 a night on average here. You expect a certain level of service. The chaise lounges have comfy blue cushions on them. But they are all dirty, old, mildewy . and stained. You need (1) towel to cover them and then (1) towel for yourself. There are no bar attendants that come to you. You have to go to bar yourself and get your orders in. Drinks are expensive and taste terrible. Spa was ok. I had a massage with a male therapist. He was good. But they cheated me out of 5 min of my service. He finished earlier. This is not honest and not right. I was upset. But they did not seem to care. The girl at the desk did give me a 5% off for my inconvenience. But an apology would of been better then 5% off. The spa has a relaxation area with bottles of water and tea. But there is no sugar for the tea, no honey, and nothing to stir the tea with. When I asked or honey or sugar. I was told they had none ??? Breakfast at \"Alfredo's\" is cheap at only $22. When you consider the variety and quality of the food. Its a good deal and the selection is fantastic. I did the buffet every morning and highly recommend it. But the service from the wait staff was mediocre at best. They where slow and no responsive to guest needs. At check out. I had an early flight. I tried to check out the night before. I was told at 12AM that I could not do that because system was in \"audit\" to do it in the morning, I tried at 5AM to check out. Again was told that they would charge all to my Credit Card on file. They could not take my cash because they where in Audit. I waited until 5:30AM and almost missed my flight. I had to leave there without being able to pay in cash and they charged my Credit Card. This is not fair as I intended to pay in cash. If this where like any other Intercontinental in the US. This would of never happened. Hotel is in a great location and right on the ocean. If you get a good deal on hotwire or priceline then I guess its ok. But DO NOT pay the rates on intecontinental.com.

I have no serious complaints! The first night I got there, I didn't really like the area, as there are a FEW abandoned businesses around. By the second night, the area had intoxicated me! It's so charming, clean (you could go barefoot) and everyone is so pleasant. ***Hotel PROS & CONS*** I can't even think of any serious complaints. The restaurants were pricey? But the food was delish. We booked trips through the hotel, they cleaned our room as long as we left the sign on the door, the AC was comfortable, there was a mini-fridge, cofeemaker...Ok, yeah the TV sucked but we weren't really on vacation to watch TV! Balcony was small, but we weren/t on vacation to stay on our balcony either. ***Beach PROS &CONS*** PROS: -not a ton of annoying noisy kids around, but there are more at the pool -water is turquoise(but not crystal clear) -water is calm -parasailing and jet skis activities available CONS: -some may be annoyed by the airplanes (I only noticed them 2 or 3x during our 4 day stay, and we spent hoursssssss on the beach[and I am sensitive to noise) Restaurants we went to: Mi Casita: is right across the street and the food was DELICOUS, even though the service was a little slow. A meal there will run you about $30-$50 Platos: A little more pricey. They serve a Paella that can feed at least SIX grown men for $45. I think it's a recurrign theme for relaxed Islands like PR- the service was a little slow. Lupis: DISGUSTING! The meal came out to just over $50, yet made Taco Bell look like a freaken' gourmet restaurant. Def. a tourist trap. For daytime fun: We booked a day catamaran trip through our hotel for $88? per person. Pros: (for day trip) -Our first stop was at Icacos, an AMAZING deserted island whose waters were crystal clear. Seriously, you could see like every grain of sand on the ocean floor -Yummy food -Energetic staff Cons: -Catamaran shelter leaked when it started raining -we didnt' spend nearly enough time at Icacos, but spent more time on Culebra (?) whose waters had more interesting fish but murkier water -Catamaran bathroom was nasty, no airfreshner, and sinks with no running water. The area had a Walgreens which was 4 minutes away. Whatever we ran out of or needed, was a 4 minute walk away at Walgreens If you want to save money, get some $3 coolers from there and get some water and cold cuts. You can get the same souveniers they sell in the souvenir shops for less than half the price.

I know there are some awful reviews on here, but we had a mostly good experience. Hotel: We were given a room when we arrived and there was no waiting. It was next to the elevator and we asked to be moved, which we were immediately and the receptionist was really nice about it. We were moved to a bigger room with a couch and table, large fridge and comfy bed. It was clean! And the maid service was great - we always had clean towels. We also had no problems with the elevators being slow, never once did we have to wait long for one. One morning there was some banging when something was being fixed, but it didnt start until 9.30 am and wasn't a problem. Your not going to PR to hang out in your room! Ours faced the street which was also quite nice, you get a view of the city. Restaurants: The food at the hotel is great - yes it is a bit pricey but if you're looking for a budget holiday you should stay elsewhere. All the restaurants in the hotel were very good, as was the poolside bar and grill. Drinks are the same price as any hotel on a beach ($10 - 12) - and they tasted good! There is the strip of shops across the road, but the food was so so. Theres a subway and several fast food places. Mi casita and Gelo were ok for breakfast, but a warning, you end up smelling of the grill if you go to these places, it is very strong, so dont wear your best outfits there. The coffee ar Mi casita was probably the worst cup I have ever had - just to warn you. PR coffee is amazing but try it elsewhere. We also tried outback steakhouse down the road and it was below par, not up to the usual standards. Ruth Chris's in the hotel is very very good, my favorite. Alfredos is also good - the breakfast buffet was very nice ($22 each). Beach and Pool: This is what you go to San Juan for!! The beach was beautiful and clean - as was the pool. Lovely blue water. A fantastic place to relax. There are always loads of chairs to choose from, never full. And plenty of unbrellas. If they start packing up the beach at 5.30 pm you can just move over to the pool, its 5 feet away. You get wrist bands too and security seemed very good. You can hire an umbrella on the beach for $5 and a guy sets it up for you. The sun is very strong so wear sunblock! There's a walgreens up the street with everything you need and we got drinks and snacks here too. We had 5 minutes of rain for the whole week - weather was fantastic. Surounding area: The area around the hotels is a bit sad and run down. It is NOT a resort outside the hotel, so if you are looking for that, I suggest you stay elsewhere. Old San Juan is lovely, really worth the trip and we ate at Barrachina which was wonderful. The sangria and pina coladas were so so good. There are lots of cute stores and beautiful buldings. Cab costs $21 to get there. It was very hot in San Juan, so we went later in the day and it was better. Many stores close at 5.30pm but the restaurants are open much later. This hotel is near the airport - so you see and hear some planes. It did not bother us at all and was not loud. Again if this bothers you - stay on another part of the island. Cab from the airport is $14. Casinos: This is not vegas, nor should it be. There are slots and tables, plenty in each hotel if you want to gamble a bit. The machines are on the older side, but it was fun. The hotel next door - El san Juan has a larger casino, but I thought that hotel was tacky and somewhat creepy. The lobby has lots of bars and there is a starbucks there if you need one. All in all we had a great vacation - but make sure you have the right expectations. This is a place to relax, get a suntan and lay on the beach. If you're looking for a glitzy activity packed vacation you'll probably be a bit disappointed here. But we loved relaxing and found this hotel to be pretty good. I would go back, but perhaps would try another part of the island. The Intercontinental is the best hotel in this area from what we saw - so I would recommend it. It may not be as good as some other intercontinentals but it gets a B+ from me.

My reservation was for a Laguna View and was made back on May 3. I received a regular room with no explanation. Upon entering the room, I noticed the bathroom was filthy. The bath tub was dirty and the bath mats were dirty as well. The refrigerator was molded and stained. The comforter was stained. I dropped a pen beside the bed and night table. When I leaned down to pick it up, there were old cookies in the floor that apparently had never been cleaned up. I was thoroughly disgusted. I didn't even unpack. I immediately went downstairs and asked for a manager. The front desk told me there was no manager available. I explained to her the situation and told her if that was best your hotel could offer at your prices I would rather find another hotel. She just stood there looking at me like I was crazy. She then told me I would have to pay for a night stay and a 100.00 penalty even though I received none of what I paid for. We stayed and our stay continued to get worse. Housekeeping left one towel an one washcloth for two people. We asked for extra towels for the next day. When they cleaned they took the extra towels we requested. The towels left were stained. While we were on the beach a worker comes over to us and tells us they start collecting the beach chairs at 5:30. The sun is still up and if you are paying $200 plus a night you should be able to stay until sunset at least. I will never stay there again.

The facility is very well maintained with the feel of an upscale beach resort. Casino is decent sized and has a good variety of tables and machines. It's not Vegas of course but it will fit the bill if you are looking to gamble. I was generally able to find a spot at a $5 blackjack table. The rooms are spacious and well decorated. However, I concur with the other reviewers that the walls can be kind of thin, hopefully you get good neighbors. The bed was comfortable and our room was cleaned well daily, no problems with maid service. Hotel restaurants are good, Ruth's Chris makes a mouth watering steak and the breakfast buffet, while not cheap, was well done. The beach is great, spacious and uncrowded. We loved it! The pool here is top notch, plenty of space and chairs both shady and sunny. The bar also makes good drinks (although really pricey). The hotel has efficient and plentiful security. The neighborhood of Isla Verde is fine to walk around in both the days and evenings. There isn't a ton of stuff around though.

It was a quick flight for both of us and we knew we wanted to stay somewhere fun and yet romantic at the same time. We choose to stay in Isla Verde and Im glad we did. All the beaches in P.R. are public and this particular beach, is lined with a strip of hotels. Upon arrival to intercontinental we were greeted by HELPFUL, sweet and really nice bell hops and service guys. We arrived early before check in which is 4 pm. They took our bags, allowed us to check in, and use their facilities while we waited for our room to get ready. We strolled the hotel, which is beautiful. It has an amazing pool and jacuzzi, a spa, 24 gym, and the beach is right in the backyard. There are many restaurants to eat at. Now at Intercontinental, im sure you can book the cheapest room and have the same experience. We purchased a laguna room and we face the front of the city towards san juan. You can see the city lights and sky at night from our balcony. This time of year seems to be tropical rainy season, which we had for the first 2-3 days but it doesnt last long, usually at night, and even if it kinda ruin your plans for the day, your room and the hotel is a great place to stay. We didnt eat much here at the hotel because we know it is expensive, but this ave is a strip full of hotels and shopping area. Right across the street there is a little center. There is ponderosa food (which is kinda like a buffet salad bar, finger food type place), lins chinese which is excellent, and this puerto rican home cooked style place called Mi Casita, which my bf and I particular loved, the food is great and the price is reaaaallllyyy cheap. We had breakfast 1 morning, and it was only $12 for the both of us, they give you really good food and the right portion. They are open from 7am-10pm, most places here close @ 11pm so make sure you eat according to time. There is also wendy's, burger king, a little supermarket, a walgreens a few blocks down, (make a right when you exit the hotel in front entrance). For night life, we went from hotel to hotel. Intercontinental is classy and sophisticated, but if you need a dj, bar, lounges and music, head to El San Juan Hotel, which is left from intercontinental. They have a huge hotel lobby which is fun and exciting, the dj plays music and there is also a house band for a more local experience. There is also lounges and alot of bars, dress to impress at these places. To the right of intercontinental, at the water club approx 2-3 blocks down, then a sharp right.. there is a restaurant called Tangerine/ Liquid. And a roof top sushi bar on the 17th foor, open roof that overlooks the ocean. Prices are ok. There is also local shops, bars, grills and other places on this avenue. For a Local experience, head to old san juan. We took the bus, it was just like a NYC bus. 0.75 cents to the last stop takes you to the bus terminal downtown. Be prepared to walk. We walked the tourist area where the cruise ships dock and also made our way to the historic sites, by the forts which was $3.00 per person to enter, definitely worth it because it was fun and you get a great view of San Juan. El Yunque Rainforest is a must. There is a half day trip from 9:30am-3pm. Its $57.00 a person through the hotel. The tour guide picks you up, gives you a tour while driving, a cave trip, history of P.R., rainforest info, and waterfall treats. This rainforest is about a 1.5 hr trip. Alot of walking, defintiely a cardiovascular workout, uphill and downhill through the forest, very beautiful and romantic .. a must see.. we stopped for lunch at a local place right by the rainforest for what i thought was some of the best P.R. food ever, definitely try the beans and rice with fried chicken and sweet plaintains, ($1.00 items -$6.00) other packages include 3 trips, the rainforest, beach and a nite rafting trip, supposedly the water illuminates in the nite while you boat near the forest. Food on the Hotel: we ate by the beach, at Splash , mostly wraps, finger foods, salads.. good food. drinks and food from $12. other than that, we didnt do much, the casino is not as big as some other hotels but if you dont like to gamble much like me, its ok. You can hotel hop, and no one I.D.'s you , you can enjoy the facilities everywhere. overall this was a great experience and i hope if others are like me, i hope this helped. I thought the service was great, the customer service was excellent, we never had a problem and if we did they were more than happy to help us, very friendly and CLEAN.. our rooms were cleaned everyday with new towels and linens. coffee maker, ice bucket, fridge, safe, iron, alarm clock (ipod home) and cable t.v. in room. official website and pics are accurate.. a beautiful experience!! and complimentary wireless internet from every room which i am submitting this review since we are leaving tomorrow :) we didnt rent a car but if you feel you need too, the hotel has an avis hook up in the lobby where you can get , if you need to or change your mind 24hr rental for about $40 .", "Date": "August 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Upstate New York", "Title": "\u201cJust so-so\u201d", "Author": "NortonBNorton", "ReviewID": "UR18478520", "Content": "I used trip advisor review as a major part of my decision to stay at the Intercontinental, as well as a friends recommendation.

We arrived around 1 pm and did have to wait for the normal check in time. Our room was gorgeous and had a great view. However, the walls were literally paper thin. Every day I would go up to the room around noon and there were children in the room directly next to us, they were singing and jumping on the beds, throwing objects against the wall and so on. This would go on until early evening, I never saw them, or an adult. I found that very strange. The beach was very nice but you had to reserve and pay for an umbrella. The pool area was nice, just small. The weather was very hot and very bright, no complaints. I think the one thing that really really surprised me was the cost of food there. Make no mistake, it might as well be Hawaii or the caribbean. Lunch at the beach restaurant for two daily was over $50 and we are talking pizza or salads. I was very disappointed in the housekeeping, very hit or miss. Some days I had to call after 4pm as they had not been there and we really needed at least more towels so we could get ready for dinner. We ate at Ruth Chris as well as the Palm and the food was very good but very very expensive. The hotel Italian restaurant was very good, very very expensive. I would guess each meal was close to $200 for two. The elevators were very hit and miss as well and as I read reviews today, I wonder why that problem cannot be fixed.some days only one elevator and it is a long wait. So I guess I would end my review by saying this hotel never lived up to my expectations, perhaps I had set them too high?The casino was very sad, very few machines and it seems there are no rules as to dress and behavior.

We apprecited the additional privacy and ability to walk right out to the pool area and the beach. The furnishings were a tasteful Caribbean motif (no over the top sea foam green and flamingo pink) with a lot of tropical wood. The only\"issues\" were that the sliding glass door was hard to open and close, the walls were a little on the thin side if you have really loud talkers (we have those neighbors for one day) and the ceiling in the bathroom was a little low.

Kids are 3 and 5. Pool is great for kids that age and pool very nice, clean and accessible. No seaweed anywhere and I'm assuming that when it does accumulate it's after a storm and the hotel would clean it up promptly. Service was great except for the concierge and we had no problems with housekeeping. And yes we got the free upgrade but I think that was possible because there were available rooms and it was low season - I wouldn't count on it at different times of the year. We booked the trip through Costco - all very smooth and the breakfast special they get you is great. If you have kids go to El Morro in Old San Juan on a cloudy day and fly kites for a day - easiest kite flying conditions you'll ever have due to the wind -- and you can buy kites there for $3-$4. Also, the hotel based Avis lady gave me a great tip on where to eat near Luquillo Beach --> try the Kiosko #2 La Parilla if you like seafood ! That beach is about 45 minutes away and is beautiful to be sure but extremely hot hot hot and zero wave action. The hotel and facilities were great and I'd recommend the place to somebody with little kids but to help you manage your expectations I've listed some negatives below. Negatives: 1) the 3 elevators servicing 16 floors were unreliable and kind of a pain but most of the guests took it well so it was a running joke. 2) the concierge(s) were useless and actually gave bad information. For example, I told them that I'd be taking the kids to Old San Juan and asked them if it would be easy to find some simple food for them there -- like a pizza. They said there were no such choices and instead directed me to an Italian sit down restaurant and a Caribean themed restaurant. When I went anyway and went to the center of town - the Plaza de Armas - I found myself surrounded by familiar kids places - mcdonalds, wendy's, burger king, etc. This would lead me to conclude that the concierges get compensated for directing people to specific places. They also gave me misinformation about the trip to Culebra Island. The concierge you see in hotel website video must have retired or something. 3) if you read reviews about the local, nearby restaurants be forewarned. The Mi Casita restaurant is close and may be good but it's always packed for dinner so don't expect to just walk over. Also, the Fast Food places near the hotel are the slowest I've ever experienced - the Burger King was stunning in it's tortoise pace, and we left after waiting for 15 minutes in a line that didn't move. The Wendy's was slightly faster. The workers were nice enough but totally inefficient. So dinners are a problem unless you drive elsewhere. Avoid: Rain forest excursion - It's 1 hour there, 1 hour back and then 90 minutes in a bus through the forest with a little 20 minutes walk. Total waste of time and I wish I had driven there myself and walked around on my own. I guess if you can't walk or are drunk from a cruise the excursion might make sense but otherwise it's a waste.", "Date": "July 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cAll in All a Great Time\u201d", "Author": "blueridgeVirginia", "ReviewID": "UR17884225", "Content": "We stayed at the Intercontinental from 7/8 through 7/12. I had a package that included the breakfast buffet and a tour of the rain forest. I was travelling with my husband, two young kids and my father - so clearly it was mixed company. However, all of us had a great time there. The overall experience was sublime. So here are my thoughts: 1) Hotel Beach and pool: The Pool is fabulous ..it has a swim up bar, jacuzzi, and several waterfalls. The water is as deep as as 61/2 feet and as shallow as 3. I would just sit under the waterfall and get a water massage. There were plenty of seats/cabanas at the pool. The beach too is nice. There was a bit ofseaweed but nothing out of control. You can rent an umbrella for the beach but we just found a palm tree and moved our seats under it. The waves can be a bit rough at times so those with small children should be careful but my 9 and 7 year had way too much fun. 2) Food: We had our very first meal there at Mi Casita across the street. Very friendly and reasonably priced. I did try the mofongo. The filling was fabulous but the mofongo itself is a quite bland (not the reataurants fault ..just the way it is). I found the food to be pricey in PR overall not too many mid priced choices. We did eat at Ruth's Chris in the hotel one day which was wonderful. As for my other favorite place it was Tantra in OSJ. We ate at Barrachina in Isla Verde as it came so highly recommended by everyone. Maybe we did not order the right things or the one in OSJ is better..but this was my only really bad food experience. It just was not that special compared to what you were paying. I had ordered a Nacho Platter and it was the worst I have had and I really cant imagine messing that up. As I mentioned we did the breakfast buffet. It was great and the all the wait staff is so nice. 3) Transportation: We rented a car one day ..to go to the Bio bay. The driving wasn't too bad you just have to be a bit more vigilant and the road signage is not the greatest. But we dont have any horror stories to report there. We rented the car from the Avis right in the hotel and it was easy to be able to pick up and return the car right there. We also used the bus one day. Not bad, takes you through some bad areas but you are not going there so who cares. The bus is clean and air conditioned and only cost 75 cents to OSJ. One thing no one told us is they take exact change only..no bills allowed. 4) Sites we visited: El Yunque, fascinating but it was my least favorite. Bio Bay (vieques) we used East Wind Cats. Loved that though the time in the water was too short. El Morro, loved that too its an amazing structure a must see. OSJ is wonderful ..the most charming architecture and cute shops. My only \"issue\" at the hotel was that we originally did not get a room with a king bed though our reservation stated that. However the hotel upgraded us to an ocean view room with a king bed.

Casino was small but when you can get a waitress they will gvie you free drinks and a hot sandwich! I had a city room over looking the main entrance. Comfortable beds, large towels, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, shower cap, shoe shine cloth, soap. Iron, hair dryer, fridgem coffee machine. In room safe, cable TV.Only thing missing was a microwave. However, you are not told when you book the room that they will charge a hold on your credit card $100.00 incidential fee for each day that you stay. I had 2 rooms so that was $800.00! they put on hold. I tried to argue with them stating that they were tying up $$ that I was planing on using during my stay. I told them that I had booked it directly from Intercontential and there was no mention of this fee only the 22% tax and resort fee on top of your room fee. They went on to explain that that's what all the hotels do and there was nothing that they could do because when they put through you credit card it automatically adds the $100 a day. Needless to say my credit card was short a couple of hundred so it was not approved and I had to give them another credit card or cash for the difference or they could not give me the room! As I was checking out 4 young ladies were checking in and to their dismay they were being told about the $100/day inc. fee, they too had to scrabble for the extra cash or else they could not get the room. I will be calling the hotel's main office to put in a formal complaint regarding this practice. It should be disclosed so that customers know that they will need extra money to be floating in a hold until your trip is over. We had 2 blackouts while we were there, one that was pre- scheduled by the power company between 10 am -2pm. And another one unanounced at about 8 am and lasted an hour. I was disappointed with the area in general. I am of Puerto Rican descent and it pains me to see such an unkept area. The streets needed repairs, there were abandon buildings in the area, your local homeless people, only one authentic puerto rician restaurant in the area. No Puerto Rican bakeries, or Pastellio /Alcapuria places in the area. With all the five star hotels in the areas you would think that they would invest in the surrounding community so that more people would come back not only for their hotel but for the culture itself. Tip: When you get to the aiport look for the tourism kisko, they wear orange shirts and they will make you a ticket for a cab to take you to the hotel they give you a fair price from the airport. However you have to watch some of the cab drivers, some just charge you $1 per checked luggage and some will charge you for every piece of luggage or carry on baggage. Same about of bags, I paid $4.00 extra coming and $8.00 going. Overall, the hotel was nice, staff was nice, the beach was awesome- clear water, some waves (watch small children-waves are sometime rough), it was warm, no fish just some sand dollars, no shells in the water most days. Go early to get a free beach chair, once they are gone they rent chairs for $4.00 a day, but they take them back at 6 pm. , so be prepared to sit on the sand if you want to stay pas 6 pm. Pool has plenty of chairs and cabanas, water fall is cute, goes up to 6 '6\". Several sections to hang out in. Use lots of sunscreen, sun doesn't feel that hot but you will get burned fast! Go to Mi Casita for Puerto Rican food, range $8.00-$24 for dinner. Go to Walgreens for water, soda, snacks, coffee, slurppies. Pueblo supermarket is behind Embassy Suite hotel about a 8 minute walk. Fast food, Church's Chicken is pretty good, there's a Pizza Hut that is good and clean. Burger King, Wendy's, KFC is also there. The mini mart across the street is not well stock but for an emergency they'll do.

I was reading mixed reviews here so I was a little nervous. Turns out the people bashing this hotel are either crazy or working for competing hotels. It truly is a four-star hotel. The location, rooms, grounds, staff, restaurants, etc. are all great. Every room has a balcony, and although my booking said I was getting a \"Garden/Pool\" view, I also had a view of the ocean (and no, I didn't have to stand sideways and lean over to see it!). The room was a really good size: I had even a desk and \"living room area\" with a couch and chair. The bathroom was fine, not anything spectacular but certainly better than average. I went to the Momoyama restaurant the first night, and ate at the Italian one for breakfast buffet every day since it was included in my package. Of course it's overpriced, but you're in a luxury tourist hotel and you either deal with it or you don't. There are plenty of fast food and \"regular\" places around to eat if you choose. I love Ruth's Chris (also in the hotel) but I figured I can eat that at home so I didn't check it out. The concierge staff could not have been more helpful.

They provided valuable tips such as to take the public bus to Old San Juan. Although I was a woman travelling alone, they assured me that it would be fine. They were right: it goes through \"the projects\" at some point, but it got me there just the same and I paid $1.50 round trip instead of $40 by taxi! I visited the spa also, which was very nicely appointed and very modern. I felt rushed during my massage (not their fault--long story) but the facial was amazing! With the exception of the waiter at the pool (had to practically stalk him to get a cocktail), every staff member was really friendly and top notch. Unless you're the Queen of England or something, I can't figure out who would find this hotel anything less than outstanding. The only complaint I'd really have is that the walls and doors are a bit too thin. Unfortunately toward the end of my stay, I had a particularly amorous couple next to me...I called the front desk and they explained that it's a common complaint and the next time it happened, they'd send security up to knock on the door and tell them to quiet down. I never had to (I later came out of my door at the same time as the guy, and gave him such a look that he was completely mortified!), but the hotel was ready to take care of it and that was much appreciated.

One recommendation I would have would be for the hotel to invest in a couple of inexpensive chairs to fit on the balconies, it would really increase the experience to be able sit outside with coffee in the AM, or 'apre beach' to watch the sunset. The hotel surprised us with a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries with a lovely note from Irene, the guest relations manager whom I corresponded with prior to our visit. That was a really nice touch. The beach was great. I think the umbrellas should just be included in the cost of the room. For us they were a must as we are not used to the hot hot sun. Sometimes they would run out of towels if you went down late afternoon. But no rush to get chairs etc. The pool area was beautiful, we didn't use the pools though, as we like the beach better.

It gives one pause to ordering a bunch of frozen drinks all day! Nice mellow bar with friendly staff. We only ate at the cafe (an OK pizza), and Al Fredo for an appetizer of prosciutto and melon. Breakfast was really only the expensive buffet, we sat at the bar for a couple of coffees that ran $10. If you get \"off campus\" we ate at Metropol twice, great down home Cuban/Puerto Rican food. Mi Casita for breakfast once, OK, but not great service from our waitress who insisted on giving us American coffee when we wanted it Puerto Rican style. We also ate Mexican at Lupi's, it was OK. Taxi's as others have said expensive, $25 w/tip to Old San Juan. Did not use the spa. Gambled a bit, small casino, but you can get a $5 blackjack table and not as \"intimidating\" as some of the larger casinos if you're not a big gambler. I guess if I'm not sounding overly enthused it is because I discovered I really like smaller hotels. We also didn't rent a car, so while everything you really need is right at the hotel, it can cost a small fortune. For a family vacation I don't see how it could be affordable if you only stayed \"on campus\". The area outside the hotel is urban. We walked around a bit to check out some of the other hotels. The Walgreens only had two aisles open, the supermarket seemed like it was ready to close down too. The \"mall\" is definitely not a mall, just a few stores-not that we were looking for a mall, but in case someone is! Overall I found it a perfectly acceptable nice place to stay, nice lobby area, gorgeous pools, beach, restaurants, spa, casino, bar. A pretty mellow 'scene', unlike the El San Juan which was very glitzy. But I would stay in a different area next time. Oh and the planes nearby were no problem.", "Date": "May 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greenwich, CT", "Title": "\u201cThis was great\u201d", "Author": "Krgl420", "ReviewID": "UR16515011", "Content": "I initially booked my vacation to stay at the El San Juan, and after reading the horrible reviews, I decided to switch over to the Intercontinental. I was so relieved I did that. My friend and I got there at around 10am, we were checked in, and we hung out by the pool for about an hour and a half. They called me on my cell and we got a city view room on the top floor wiht a balcony, and the view really isn't as bad as it sounds. The room was extremely spacious, with enough closet space and a generous bathroom, big enough for two girls to get ready for the night and not be in each other's way. There were plenty of clean towels always on hand, the cleaning people were great and cleaned our room every day. My only complaint is that the water pressure wasn't that great, but maybe I'm just used to my shower at home. The room was basic but modern, and the beds are really comfortable, maybe a little too soft for me, but thats just my opinion. There is a Walgreens down the block, we stocked up on waters and chips to snack on at night, and there is plenty of space in the room's refridgerator for big bottles of water and stuff. It was perfect, actually. The pool area was very clean and very beautiful. We stayed on the beach every day though because it's just my preference. I liked the breeze on the beach and I rented an umbrella for &10 a day (which is worth every penny). The sun is extremely brutal in PR and both my friend and I who never burned got red, so make sure to wear sunscreen! The little cafe on the beach of the hotel was good, it was nothing to really write home about, but the prices were definitely very reasonable, and they make great drinks! The pina coladas and their Jungle Fever drink were always by myside. They have a waitress walking around the beach to bring you drinks and what not. Coming from the NYC area, these drinks are definitely reasonably priced. As for food, to me, nothing was terribly overpriced. The first night we went to the El San Juan to the Palm restaurant. That to me, was just overpriced Italian food, even though it was really good, it's just like home cooking to me so the prices were a little high. The second night we went to Ruth's Chris steakhouse in the hotel - PHENOMENAL!!! The steaks are pricey (but typical for steakhouses in the NorhtEast), but my friend and I saw a special they were having - $99 for two people, and we each got a salad, choice of meat (we chose the petite filets and they were to die for!! Like butter!) a side dish and dessert. Dessert wasn't so great, but then again, we were soooooo stuffed with our meal Id on't think our stomachs could have fit the dessert anyway. The last night we went to the hibachi restaurant in the hotel. Not my favorite place, but I was definitely pleasantly surprised at how tasty the food was. Plus we met this great couple that was on their honeymoon. She is a native of PR and told us about some places to go out for drinks and whatnot. We did go into Old San Juan one day. I love Old San Juan, way better than San Juan, and we heard that the night life out there is great, we just never made it out at night. The cab fare is $20 each way, but def worth it considering all the traffic and the congestion, that driving there yourself would not be fun. We went to the restaurant where they invented the Pina Colada, Barrachina or something like that. It's around the corner fromt he Burberry outlet, and it was AMAZING. so were the Pina coladas! I would def go back there. We didn't get to really experience the true nightlife as we were there during the week, and we were told by all the locals that nothing really got going until Thursday. We went over to the bar at the El San Juan, and I felt out of place, like I was too young to be there (I'm 26). Also, the drinks weren't made that great, and the staff at the El San Juan weren't as attentive or friendly, although I do believe that the pool area at the El San Juan was a little nicer and more modern, with more modern music playing. But as far as the rooms and the rest of the service, I can't say. You should def check out the Water Club. It's a 8-10 minute walk from the hotel, and it has a really cool rooftop lounge. Its def worth checking out. The concierge was very helpful and they have a list of excursions to take if you feel the need. We didn't, but looking back, I wish we had. We did go jetskiing, which was really fun. They're stationed on the beach right outside the El San Juan. 30 minutes was $70, which is a lot, but it was sooo fun. Some people complained about the seaweed - some days the water was chopier than others, but the seaweed tends to gather right on the shore, if you walk into the water a little further its completely gone and very clean. Overall my experience at the Intercontinental was great. I def would go back to PR, just not to San Juan.", "Date": "May 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "maryland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation!!

The view was so beautiful, the ocean, palms trees, pool and everything! The pool area was great, the staff was great and attentive and very nice. My only suggestion is in Puerto Rico things are expensive, the first day we arrived we got lunch in the hotel grill outside by the pool, and we ordered four sandwiches and four drinks and it cost us $100.00, and taxi are about $25 each way to go to Old San Juan. So if your on a budget, go to places to eat outside the hotel. There are plenty of places to go and eat that are good and around the corner. We went on great tourists trips like, snorkling, going to the rain forest, going to old san juan and went to Flamenco beach.

The only issue I had with the hotel were the terribly slow elevators and the paper thin walls/doors. We had a wonderful city view room (it's not as bad as it sounds, I actually preferred it over an ocean view). The room was a connector to the room next door and you could pretty much carry on a coversation with people next to you without even raising your voice. The rooms were spacious and clean and the staff were excellent. The only place we experieced bad service on the entire island was at the Burger King across the street. The food at the Intercon is overrated and too pricey. We did dine at Alfredo the first night and the bill was around $84. It was medicore. We did have room service breakfast for two mornings and it was excellent. We both split the $24 power breakfast and it was enough food for 2 people. I do not recommend purchasing beverages at the outdoor bars. They are terribly watered down and isn't worth the $10 you pay. Go across the street to the supermarket and get a cooler and take that with you to the beach. I saw one traveler mention a rental car. I DO NOT recommend doing that. We thought it would be a great idea to drive to Ponce in a rental car and ended up in a wreck 100 miles from San Juan. The drivers in Puerto Rico are absolutely crazy. The roads are not clearly marked and you can get confused very easily. We immediately returned the car upon our arrival to San Juan and relied on taxi's to take us around. Yes it is about $20 to go to Old San Juan from the hotel, but because of the wreck and trying to find our way around we wasted pretty much an entire day of our short trip. As far as restuarants are concerned we did dine at Mark's at the Melia in Ponce (it was OK, better than the Intercon), Mi Casita (very good, service was not that slow), Barrichina (in Old San Juan, WONDERFUL), the Taco Maker (Tex-Mex type). We did cave in and go to Burger King and Pizza Hut. Beans and plantains get old after a while. Overall it was a great experience. Even though the hotel is right by the airport you grow used to the planes (you can only see them from the city view rooms anyway).

Many have complained about the service, and I must say, we only had but amazing service when we went. There were 4 families that stayed in that hotel for a wedding and non of us had any issues with the hotel. Service was impeccable. FRONT DESK: here is where I thought I would run into issues. However, they proved me wrong and were more than helpful with checking in and any other questions I had for them. In fact, I had originally booked just a city-view room and they were kind enough to upgrade me and my parents-in-law to a beautiful and immensely big ocean view room. If you have any questions about restaurants and such, the concierge is very knowledgable and capable of guiding anyone to the right direction. ROOMS: the ocean-view room was amazing. HUGE. We had a king size bed that was beyond comfortable, a love seat, a one-seater, coffee table, and an office table. Needless to say, this room had plenty of space. The closet fit all of our clothes comfortably and there is a small space outside the bathroom for a vanity area where there is great lighting for prepping to go out and applying makeup. The bathroom is also quite spacious and has one of the most powerful showers I have ever experienced in my life. Showering at this hotel was fast and amazing. It was a massage and a shower in one! Lastly, everything was clean! A great plus for a germaphobe like myself. POOL: pretty large and very clean. Never any straws or any nasty things floating. There were many zones ranging from 3 feet to 6 feet. A couple of waterfalls for a nice hydro massage. They start giving the towels poolside at about 8am. This help curbing the habit of people \"saving\" the chairs too early. If you go early enough, before 9 froom what I have noticed, they even give you a neckroll along with the towel. They will give you a bracelet when you check these items out and upon returning them, do not forget to ask them to cut those pesky bracelets off. BEACH: We never laid out in the pool and stayed on the beach our entire stay. To us, nothing beats the sound of the ocean and the amazing breeze that puts us both to sleep quicker than we ever anticipate. The beach was clean. Not much seaweed. Out of the 4 days we were there, only once did I see a lot of seaweed. And they were quickly taken away by the staff. For those that love the calm beach, it all depends on the day. Our first day there, it was VERY rough. The waves were huge and intimidating. Each day thereafter, the waves and the ocean slowly calmed down; and our trip ended with very calm waters by the 4th day. I don't know if it is dependent on the weather on some other factor, but there was no consistency as far as how rough or calm the water was that day. There were plenty of beach chairs, so there was no need to get up early and \"save\" a chair. They also have umbrellas available for a fee (I think $10) and there is a staff member that will assist you in putting it in. RESTAURANTS: this is one aspect of the hotel I cannot be of any help. Sorry, but I did not eat at any of the restaurants after reading all the reviews about the prices they charge. However, my hubby did eat at Alfredo's, the Italian restaurant, for breakfast and he said the omelet was big and delicious. After I found out the price ($14), delicious should have been the least of what that omelet was! My parents-in-law ordered a pizza for room service and I remember them saying it was not memorable whatsoever. MISCELLANEOUS: The elevators were a bit on the slow side of things. Press \"LL\" on elevator if you want to bypass the lobby to go to the pool. The casino was fairly small at this place. Drinks at the bar were mostly around $10 to $14. We ate at the restaurant across the street for breakfast called Mi Casita. Service is beyond slow, but the price is just right. Most of the breakfast items were $5 give or take. I ordered the eggs, homefries, and toast for $4.95. The homefries has a different and addictive flavor that I've never tasted in any homefries before! There is also a convenience store next to Mi Casita. I highly suggest buying bottled water and juices here. I think the hotel charged $8 for the big Fiji water and $3.50 for the small bottles. A six pack of water bottles cost us about $3.50. Save your money and walk across the street and hang right for about a 1/2 a block. They are all there in that little strip mall. Within that strip mall is also a burger king and a ponderosa. In fact, there are so many American food restaurants that I was a bit disappointed of the location. Nonetheless, it is convenient for those who like them. Pamela's had amazing food...expensive, but worth every penny! La Pascaderia Atlantica had the best seafood ever! I'm salivating just thinking about it again. Definetly save room for the tres leches for dessert. Ridiculously delicious! Any of the bakeries around the area always had great bread and sandwiches. There is Reposteria Espana not too far from the hotel. For those needing Starbucks fix, right next door to our hotel is the El San Juan. There, you will find two Starbucks! Also great shopping at this hotel. It's very lively at night. Great band by the bars. Dress to impress if you go at night to party. But definitely a great place to hang out. Huge casino. The Intercontinental looks like a dot next to there's. We went to Old San Juan our last day since we had a 5:45 PM flight out of Puerto Rico. They tell you to be at the airpot 2 hours before departure. If you want a late check-out, the hotel charges about $75. Check out is at 12PM, but they were kind enough to give us till 1PM. Ask for the courtesy room if you don't want the $75 charge. I think they give you 30 minutes to use it. We checked out at 1 and gave our luggage to the bellhop and walked around Old San Juan for a couple hours. Taxi there is about $19 per way and takes between 10-15 minutes. Beautiful buildings and cobble-stone roads. La Bombanera had the best food! Ask for la mallorca (pronounced la mayorca). Goes wonderfully with coffee. Renting a car would be advisable. Taxis are very expensive there. Cost $7 to go down 2 hotels. If I didn't have the long dress on (on our way to the wedding) I would have walked that way! Intercontinental charges $16 for parking (self-park) across the street. Valet parking costs $22 per day. If your going to Old San Juan, parking is horrible! We took a taxi and were glad we did! Always ask for the price before you go in to avoid getting ripped-off! Have fun!

My only disappointment is in Puerto Rico itself. 1. Hotel location-I was disappointed in the area around this hotel.Lots of American fast food places to eat at and no feel that you were in a different country. Might as well have been in Florida. Fast food joints were great for cheap lunches on the beach. 2.Pool/Beach-Whoever designed this pool did a fantastic job. The large waterfalls drown out any noise from the pool bar, pool restaurant and noisy people. There is a great mix of shade and sun. The towel people will only give you 1 towel each and 1 pillow each. The pillow was great.. They always gave us 4 large towels in the room for 2 people, so we just brought extra towels down with us to the bool/beach to compensate for the 1 towel per person allotment at the pool. The beach is large enough to really spread out and not be on top of others. Chaise lounge chairs were free but the umbrella was $10. You rent them from the pool/towel hut. The umbrellas are a little on the small side. My husband had a hard time getting completely under it. There was always something sticking out. Out of the 6 days we were there the water was calm 2 days, and rough 4 days. By rough I mean you could not relax and carry on a conversation in the water. You had to be very alert or get wiped out by a wave. Eventually, I just when in up to my knees. 3.Food/restaurants- Do yourself a favor and bring a collapsible cooler. Go to Walgreens..buy alot of water and pop. Fill your cooler with ice (provided at the hotel ice machine) and enjoy your cheap drinks on the beach. We also bought beer at the grocery store accross the street ($7 for 6 cans) and had our own cheap happy hour. The first day of arrival my husband and I split a cheeseburger/fries and he had a beer. The bill from the beachside restaurant came to $25 including tip. So needless to say that was the last day we ate hotel/beach food. My husband took the walk accross the street to fast food heaven and bought us Burger King or Taco Bell for lunch. Everytime he came back through the lobby with our lunch food, a Manager advised him he would not be allowed to eat it at the pool. Since we were on the beach this was not an issue. Just very annoying. For dinner we avoided the extremely pricey restaurants at the hotel and opted for Lupis (just past the El San Juan). They had what might be the best steak fajitas I have ever had. ($13,I think) and $3 Medella beers. Also ate 1 night at Outback(at Embassy Suites). At first the prices seem comparable to home until you realize they do not include the salad, like at home. Good meal. Just costs more than home. Hotel room- Got upgraded to an oceanview room. Slept every night with the door open to hear the waves. The room had a ceiling fan, so that kept us cool enough at night even with the door open. The room also had a lighted make-up mirror. The refrigerator is stocked with overpriced hotel beverages but, there is still alot of room to put your own beverages or leftover dinner. Car rental-We rented an intermediate for $30 a day including tax from Dollar rent a car at the Holiday Inn(1 block from Intercontinental). They do close at 5pm so unless you want to pay $16 to park it at the Intercontinental make sure you get going in the morning so that you can return it by 5pm. We drove to El Yunque and were able to hike to the waterfall, stop for lunch and shop Belz outlet mall. The drive to El Yunque takes longer than you think it will. Lots of stop lights made it take 1 1/2 hours. Hotel rate- I booked at Interline Travel.com. This website is for Airline employee discounted rates. We paid $208 per night for a lagoon view room. Their rates are a real deal when you realize the 22% taxes are included. I bought the AmbassadorClub membership ($150) from Intercontinental.com which gives you a one category room upgrade at check in. We would have been upgraded to Pool view but, since they didn't have any available ...we got upgraded to oceanview. Casinos-The El San Juan casino was our favorite. A good amount of 1 cent machines. This casino does get crowded on Wednesday and Thursdays with locals. (They must have some promotion for them because they were allover the penny machines.) We did not like the Intercontinental casino, at all. Not enough penny machines. And the ones they did have wouldn't take your bills or vouchers. They just kept rejecting anything you tried to put in them. The Embassy Suites casino was very small.

The hotel was a little to quite for me and the casino was small and had out dated slot machines. We stayed in a suite which was nice and clean, but small compared to many suites I have seen. There was no tub, which in my opinion is not a suite. All the suites only had a city view with a very small balcony not big enogh for a small table or chair. And with having a city view suite there is not much privacy because you are on the front entrance side of the hotel and there is alot of traffic in and out of the hotel. There are plenty of places outside the resort to get food at a great price. Not sure of the exact name but I believe it's called Misa Casa ( great food /great price) which is in th shopping center across the street from resort. There is also a nice small sushi bar about a block up the street that served excellent sushi and the miso soup was to die for.

Stayed from April 25th until May 1st. We arrived at the hotel at 11:30 am. Check in time is at 4:00 pm, but the person checking us in (the concierge manager, who was incredibly kind, and very helpful), got us checked in early. Our room was oceanfront and worth every penny. The beds face the ocean so you can actually see the ocean immediately when you wake up. Rooms were kept incredibly clean every day. Housekeeping was very attentive. Complimentary shampoos, soaps, and lotions smelled very nice and were good quality. The balcony was standing room only. The pool area was nice. There were some cabanas that were first come, first serve. They were taken every day we were there except one day when we got to the pool by 9 am and snagged one finally! Security guards kept non guests from using the pool. I only wish they would have a designated smoking area; there were a LOT of smokers. Not pleasant for non smokers like me. Beach area was okay. Pretty scenery, but way too much seaweed. As you're standing in the water, all the seaweed gets intertwined within your legs and you feel like you're being swallowed by the stuff. There weren't a lot of people in the water, and I'm guessing the seaweed is the reason. But if you decide to go on the beach, the beach chairs are free, but the umbrellas cost $10 (which I thought was worth it instead of roasting in the sun.) Mediterranean Cafe has very good sandwiches. Frommer's recommended them and I can see why. I tried the lamb pita, my husband had the cuban sandwich. Sodas, a small paper cup at $3 each, do not come with free refills. Alfredo's (the inventor of Fettuccine Alfredo opened this chain) was also very good. I had, of course, Fettuccine Alfredo, and the chocolate molten cake. High class service, without the pretentiousness. Directly across the street there's a supermarket where you can get snacks and drinks. There's also a restaurant called MiCasitas that claims it has the best Mofongos on the island. They were very busy and had a line out the door. My husband and I both tried the beef Mofongos. If you're not so brave, there's also Subway, Domino's Pizza, Church's Chicken, Baskin Robbins, and Burger King in that same shopping complex. Be careful about taking taxi's around town. ALWAYS ask how much it costs to go somewhere BEFORE getting in the cab. They're supposed to work in zones, but we discovered that some drivers are dishonest to tourists because they don't think they know any better. I found this part to be very frustrating. There's an AVIS rental car service right in the hotel lobby. We rented a car for two days to go to El Yunque and Ponce the next day. Cost for two days, plus insurance cost $165. Self parking per day at the hotel costs $16. Parking lot is located across the street. Day of departure we used their hospitality room. It is available on a first come, first serve basis from 12 pm to 6 pm. We went at 4:45 and saw that no one had even used it all day; I don't think anyone knows about this service that they offer since they don't advertise it. It's free but it's only for 30 minutes. Overall stay was quite pleasant. We booked through priceline, so we got a great deal. I would never have payed full price for this resort. For the price I paid, I feel like I got a great resort. It was farther than I would've hoped for from Old San Juan; it was a 15 minute cab ride. The doors were paper thin, and had no buffer between the bottom of the door to the floor so you could hear every single door SLAM SHUT at night and all morning. You could hear the planes fly by, since the airport is only a 5 minute cab ride away, but if you ignored them, they really didn't bother you after a while. And lastly, even though the concierge manager guy (who was not even Puerto Rican which might explain it) was very nice, every single other person working at the concierge desk and the check in desk was incredibly curt and rude to my husband and me.

We found this hotel to be exactly what we were looking for (beautiful-relaxing pool, nice beach, great service, modern rooms with a balcony, warm weather) and recommend this place without hesitation. Further details provided below: Room: We debated between an ocean view room and a pool view in the club wing and chose the club wing for about $350/night AAA rate. The club wing is a 2 story building that is perpendicular to the ocean with all rooms facing the pool. The rooms are supposed to be slightly larger than the main building and each room has a balcony with chairs (see pictures). Each room in the main building had a balcony, but not big enough for chairs. None of the club rooms had a very good view of the ocean but the pool is stunning enough. With the club, you get free continental breakfast (bagels, fruit, hard boiled eggs, etc) until 10am and appetizers along with pour your own cocktails between 5pm and 7pm. The only thing that I did not like about the club was they did not let you take any food or drinks out of the common area, and I would have preferred to sit out on my balcony with a cocktail while watching the sunset. When we checked in, they upgraded us for free (without asking and without a priority club number) to a suite which was essentially two connecting regular rooms with a whirlpool and walk in closet (see pictures). From reading other comments, I think their policy is to upgrade if available, so off-peak times have a good chance of upgrades. Hotel: This is a 4 star hotel with a beautiful pool well described by others. All of the employees were very nice and treated us like royalty. There was one lady who did not like to give out more than one towel at the pool but everyone else was magnificent. The fitness center overlooked the ocean with modern equipment (included in daily resort fee). They had a small spa that I would rate at 3/5 stars. Food and drinks at the pool were expensive, but nothing more than any other beach front resort that we have been to. However, a mini-mart, grocery store, and numerous chain restaurants (Subway, Church\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chicken, etc.) are across the street from the hotel. There are 3 dinner restaurants on site that were priced what you would expect for a resort ($20/plate at the Italian, $30/plate at the Japanese, $40/plate at Ruth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris). We went to the Italian which was very good, great service, and it was nice to sit outside with the chirping frogs. We also went to the Japanese (hibachi - cook in front of you) which we loved. We did not go to Ruth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris, but went to BLT Steak at the Ritz Carlton and it was very similar to a Ruth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris in terms of quality and price. The Ritz was more of a 5 star property (i.e. Tiffany Co on site, etc.) but most of the rooms did not have a balcony and it was about twice the cost of the Intercontinental; after looking at both properties, we would stay at the Intercontinental again. The El San Juan Hotel next door was much more of a spring break atmosphere which was nice to visit, but we enjoyed retreating to our peaceful and relaxing hotel. Restaurants: Within walking distance from the hotel, we went to BLT Steak (described above), Metropol (good quality local fare at very reasonable prices), and Mi Casita which we did not have a good experience at although you get a lot of food at a cheap cost. We also ate at Aquaviva in Old San Juan which had great seafood although expensive. Activities: The rain forest was great. Some recommend renting a car but we did the guided tour ($57/person through the concierge) which was well worth it. We saw some people who rented a car and had no idea where to go or what to see and were essentially trying to follow our guide in their cars. Deep sea fishing out of old San Juan was a lot of fun (caught a 30lb Mahi Mahi through Grand Illusion Charter and they filleted for you if you want). We also enjoyed walking around Old San Juan.", "Date": "May 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "florida", "Title": "\u201cfun, relax and explore\u201d", "Author": "FloridaRms", "ReviewID": "UR15629729", "Content": "This was our first visit to Purto Rico, and for our first stay we couldn't have chosen a more perfect place.

We got a room on the 5th floor facing the pool and it was great. We were not too concerned about the room location since we were not planning on staying in the room all day. We arrived at the hotel around 1:30pm and were checked in right away even though check-in is usually at 4pm. The bell boy brought up the bags promptly and we were off to the beach and pool almost immediately. The pool and beach is excellent at this hotel. You have to get a wrist band in order to get towels & pillows and it also identifies you as a guest of the hotel when on the beach. The pool area has tents with chairs that can be reserved a day earlier or taken on a first come first serve basis. All the hotel staff was very courteous and helpful throughout our stay and we had no complaints at all. The concierge at the hotel was very helpful in providing us with directions and recommendations during our stay there. The restaurants on site were expensive and so was room service. Prior to visiting Puerto Rico my wife and I decided to only consume local cuisine so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ever eat at the hotel. The hotel itself has a Steak House, an Italian Restaurant & a Japanese Restaurant. The pool side bar and the beach front cafe were also pretty expensive. Please note that the beach front cafe is cheaper than the pool side bar even though they are only a few feet away from each other. I basically went to the small supermarket directly in front of the hotel and grabbed some Medalla Light (local) beer and brought it to the room and put it in the fridge. I then took it down to the pool and beach in a plastic cup. The same beer 10oz costs $4 at the hotel while the super market sells it for $1.25. The security at the hotel was very good and the pool and beach guard (Mike) is very friendly. We rented a car for our stay from Alamo and I chose to use the self parking option. Since parking is scarce in the area, all hotels charge for parking. At the InterContinental they charge $16 for self parking and $22 for valet. The self parking lot is across the street from the hotel but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a problem at all to use. Some people have mentioned concern about crossing the street. We live in the NJ/NY area and crossing the streets in our areas is pretty similar so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a big deal for us. If you want to have some local fare walk over to Mi Casita directly in front of the hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small place with a small menu but the food is excellent. Another restaurant in walking distance is Metropol. They have Puerto Rican and Cuban food and is excellent as well. We went to Metropol twice during our stay. We went to Old San Juan a few times (for meals and sightseeing). It was convenient to have a car. I used my blackberry and Google maps (gps) to help me with the directions. All road signs are in Spanish so a GPS will really help. Some restaurants that we tried in Old San Juan are, Tantra (Indo-Latino fusion), Dragonfly (Latino-Asian Fusion) and Cafeteria Mallorca (located on Calle San Francisco in Old San Juan) typical local restaurant - they have some really good rice dishes and a chicken soup that local crave for. Another must visit restaurant is Ajili Mojili (1006, Ashford Avenue San Juan, PR 00907 Puerto Rico). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located in Condado (between Isle Verde and Old San Juan). They have the best Mofongo and Asapao (local delicacies). Day trips we did: El Yunque Rain Forest - I even took a dip under the water fall after the 30 min hike. ATV tours at Hacienda Carabali - Ask the concierge for the directions to this place. We did the 2 hour ATV tour and it was awesome. They even stopped at a river and we were able to jump in. They are located between the El Yunque Rain Forest and Luquillo Beach. Luquillo Beach - One of the best beaches in PR. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located a miles past the road to the El Yunque Rain Forest towards Fajardo. Try out some local food at the Luquillo Beach food kiosks. If you are going to the above mentioned 3 places I recommend that you take the 187 road. This is the most scenic way towards Fajardo. You will also pass some unique local kiosks with food and drinks (try some coco - coconut water). Old San Juan - Takes about a full day to view the whole town and all the fortresses, etc. We will definitely go back to PR and stay at the InterContinental San Juan Resort, Spa & Casino.

I didn't even ask for the upgrade, it was just offered to us. My one thought was - at the time of booking I thought to enter my \"Priority Membership Card\" since the Intercontinenal is part of that family of hotels. I'm not in it for the points, but I've heard that sometimes you can get upgraded to a better floor or get some better amenities with just being a member (and membership is free). So...maybe just having that member number on the reservation helped. Who knows. Anyway - the view was GREAT. Pool was FABULOUS. Our 7 year old couldn't get enough! Food at hotel IS expensive. However - if you want to splurge - the Japanese restaurant is good and a hit with kids. The Ruth's Chris steakhouse is also excellent. There is a bakery across the street that has cheap breakfast - like bagels and pancakes. Also , Mi Casita, a Puerto Rican restaurant across the street, is a nice alternative. Not totally cheap - but better priced than the hotel. Go to Walgreens down the street for snacks/groceries. You can put stuff in the in-room fridge for b'fast (we did). There's a subway across the street - and Domino's pizza. Pizza Hut is nearby as is Wendy's. We HIGHLY recommend a tour to the Rain Forest.

I highly recommend this resort because the location is excellent, the beach beautiful and the staff excellent. First, the hotel is in a terrific location for a peaceful and relaxing beach resort experience away from the crowds of the Condado. It's a $11 (plus tip) quick cab ride from the airport and taxis arrive within a moment of being called by the bell boy staff (truly they're lined up just outside of the entrance to the hotel ). There are many restaurants just across the street (Burger King, Church's Chicken, Subway, Ponderosa , Bagel place, etc, however, we opted for Mi Casita, a wonderful little local restaurant serving typical Puerto Rican meals where you can enjoy breakfast, lunch and dinner in a casual luncheonette-type atmosphere with its own special charm. If you're looking for fine dining and ambiance try another restaurant. There's also a small grocery store in the shopping center and a Walgreen's within about a ten minute walk. We requested early check-in and had to wait for our room. We booked an oceanview room and stayed on the 9th floor. The view was magnificent as we overlooked the tops of the palm trees and had a broad view of the ocean. If possible, I recommend a room in the center of the building and not on the far ends to avoid a view of roof tops along with the ocean. All rooms are advertised to have flat screen TVs. Ours did not and although we considered changing to a room that did, none were available on the first night and it wasn't worth the effort to move on the next day. But, if that is important to you, I suggest that you ask about it before your room is assigned. The room was nicely renovated, not as fancy and luxurious as others I've stayed in, but certainly comfortable and nice enough. We had a refrigerator, little sitting area, king size bed (which was comfortable). The terrace is too small to sit out on and there are no chairs out there, so you just stand and marvel at the view instead. The pool and beach are beautiful and very clean. We had to ask for help finding lounge chairs because apparently people put their towels down early in the day and leave the area. The pool staff delivered two lounge chairs to us after removing towels from lounge chairs after confirming that they had been abandoned hours before. The hotel provides you with nice fluffy towels as you enter the pool area, which is very convenient. The hotel was clean and the staff could not be more pleasant and attentive. I read several reviews where the writers did not find the staff to be accommodating, but our experience was exactly the opposite; the staff was outstanding at all times. Drinks and okay food are pricey at the beach restaurant and pool bar, but in my opinion, it was worth the splurge to sit so near to the beach (or in the pool). You can go across the street and stock up on drinks, etc., and bring them down to the beach if you want to save a lot of money. We didn't eat in any of the hotel restaurants other than at the outdoor cafe. The pizza there was $14, probably enough for two people. The food was really okay, but the main event was those views! Check out is at 12:00, but if you wish to spend the day enjoying the amenities, you can store your bags at the bell station until you're ready to shower and change and ask the front desk for the use of a \"Hospitality Suite,\" where you'll be given a guest room room to use for 1/2 hour. We thought that this was quite a special service for the hotel to offer its guests; unlike having to use a common cabana area or other alternative as in other hotels. I spent a good deal of time researching and reading Trip Advisor reviews (which I hold in high regard) to decide which San Juan hotel best suited our needs in terms of location, comfort, amenities, attentiveness of staff, etc., before deciding on the InterContinental in Isla Verde.

We picked this hotel because of the great reviews. I know everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experiences are different, so I thought I should share mine. The Intercontinental was overall an okay looking hotel, nothing special. The service on the other hand was terrible. From the moment we got there to check in at the front desk we were given attitude, especially by Barbara (who we always some how had to deal) She seemed bothered by everything and looked at us as if we were asking her for stuff that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to do with her job! One of the worst things about the hotel, are the elevators. You could hear everyone who were staying at the hotel complain constantly about how long they took! 15-20 minutes to just go up to your room is unacceptable.. and when they finally did arrive, they would be so packed with guests that you had to squeeze in.. People in the elevator always tried to make room because there was an understanding that no one wanted to wait another 20 minutes for the next elevator! Something to note.. Check out is at 12pm.. and although they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you this till after.. they will deactivate your keys at 12pm sharp.. even if you have requested a late check out. So something to be aware of. The Pool area was definitely the highlight of this hotel. There were always chairs available and the pool wait staff was great, thanks especially to Javier & Wilmer! When I go away, even if its for a long weekend.. its because I want to relax and feel calm. Anytime we had to deal with the hotel employees, they were rude, abrupt and unhelpful or just took forever to do anything. I believe they need to be retrained in Customer Service. So.. in my opinion, the Intercontinental Hotel chain tends to mean you are getting a good quality hotel with great service..

We booked our stay at the Intercontinental for 8 people through Hotwire. We had two, double bed rooms on the 5th and 6th floor. Not the best views but who cared we were out on the beach most of the time. It was only a 10 minute drive from the airport!!! We arrived on Friday and the hotel was packed with people checking in. They only had two people checking people into their rooms so the wait was very long. On top of that we were told our rooms were not ready. So we left our bags with the bellman and went to lunch. The man checking us in said he would call us in an hour. It was about two hours later that we returned when he did not call us. We were extremely tired from traveling so we just went straight to him and demanded our rooms although he had not called yet. He somehow made it work when one member of our group got a little agressive and refused to wait any longer. I must say that was the only hiccup we faced. The rooms were very clean, comfortable beds, and were overall a great size. The one thing I enjoyed most was the in-room safes that you didn't have to pay extra for or put a deposit for. Matter of fact, all you had to do was create a 4 digit code and reset it every couple of days- NO keys...I loved it. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Always carrying conversations and catering to our every need. We didn't eat much at the hotel itself because it was expensive for the portions. We had the buffet breakfast one day and ate at the Alfredo restaurant which was excellent also once. The drinks served at the Mediterrean cafe by the pool is overly priced for VERY watered down drinks. So we went to the grocery store across the street and bought drinks and juice and would mix it in our room and take it with us to the beach and pool. Some food recommendations: Mi Casita, Gelo's Bakery- both across the street. Lupis next door had the worest food. Of course they also have Subway, Burger King, Wendy's etc... The grounds by the way are gorgous. Wonderful pool area and beach. Nice and clean and they provide towels. If you're up for it there's a kiosk on the beach that sell jet ski, parasailing etc... We all did the Banana Boat....the BEST expereince. It was soo fun. Try it! Nightlife was a little dim in Puerto Rico. We enjoyed Brava the most- located inside the El San Juan, which had the best bars and chill spots. **Side Note: We rented a car from the Avis in the lobby and drove to El Yunque Rainforest (35 minute drive), to the Bacardi Factory, to Ocean Park Beach, Luquillo Beach and Old San Juan rather than taking a taxi and paying so much more.** Have Fun on your trip to Puerto Rico!!!", "Date": "March 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous beach front Resort\u201d", "Author": "jessika14", "ReviewID": "UR14256716", "Content": "My stay and interaction with the Intercontinental was one of business. I had the task of researching for a place to hold my company's convention. I found the Intercontinental. I was flown down there, all expenses paid, for 3 nights to take a look at the property. I then also stayed there for another 3 nights during our convention. I was there on business for the first trip so I was treated like royalty. Meals prepared from the Head Chef, one of their nicer rooms, a private dinner on the beach along the boardwalk, complimentary trips off the property, meeting with management etc... Everyone there was beyond nice and professional. Now I know this is not the treatment most people will get, but it is certainly a reflection on how they treat their customers and the pride that they take in their property. Top notch employees all around. My room on this trip was in the \"club\" house. It overlooked the pool area (which was still a good view cause the pool is awesome). The room was great. The marbled bathroom, the large fluffy bed, the sitting area, the deck. This area also has a private dining space for the club members. Breakfast is served here as well as appetizers from 5pm-7pm. My second stay was more normal with no special treatment. My room was a regular room in the hotel. I did get beach views, which was gorgeous. The room itself is your standard hotel room. It is very clean however. The property is amazing. It sits right on the beach. The beach is public, but they do have people that make sure not just anybody wanders onto the property. The pool area is great too. Palm trees, and a swim up bar, another regular bar, a huge hot tub. There is a \"rock wall\" type thing in the pool with a waterfall coming down. It definately sets that tropical feel and makes your stay all the more relaxing. The staff for the pool area are also awesome and extremely nice. The steps out of the hotel leading to the pool are a grand staircase that makes you feel like you are Scarlet O'Hara at the beach making your grand entrance. I am not much for gambling and didn't spend tons of time in the casino. I can't really compare it to any other casino cause I have never really been! But it had slot machines, black jack, poker tables etc... and all the bright, flashing lights you would expect. The whole hotel is very nice. Marble everywhere. It just has presence. There are several hotels on the property including a Ruth Chris, an Italian restaurant that just opened when I was there. It was a top notch high end restaurant. We met the Chef as her personally came out to our table. A great meal. One of the best I have ever had. The also have a Japanese restaurant on the premise.

Casino on the property is lackluster...but if you want the glintz of Vegas the El San Juan is right next store. We actually preferred the relaxed, island feel of the Intercontinental though. We used the pool restaurants for lunch...they were very good and resort priced. We had breakfast across the street at Mi casita....very reasonable and good. Breakfast for four is around $30...compared to $22 per person at the hotel. We dined outside the resort for dinner...Barachino's is about a fifteen minute walk...excellent island food VERY friendly staff. We also tried Aijji Modito in Condado despite good reviews the food was OK...we found out after they changed management about a month ago. By far the best Puerto Rican fare was at Raices in Old San Juan....large portions...delicious. Plus, the atmosphere is fun all the staff dresses in traditional island costume. We also dined at The Parrot Club in Old San Juan which was very good...The Dragon Fly ,which is run by the same owner, is asian infused...but is more of a tapis bar than restaurant. Plates are small and to share. Its a good option if you want to eat lighter...island fare can be heavy. Try the duck nachos... In terms of siteseeing, we loved the location of the hotel....being 15 to the airport was great. We went to Old San Juan every night...we rented a car...about a 15 min drive. Parking lots were accessible and a mere $3 for the day. The forts are interesting with beautiful vistas. We went to Baccardi by car...but wouldn't waste your time...you do NOT tour the actual factory anymore...its a short movie and some displays. The Rain Forest is a great trip for kids....loved swimming in the falls. While there we also went to Luquillo Beach which is a beautiful beach, but if your staying in Isle Verde, the hotel beach is nicer with more amenties..so you might want to skip it. We did eat lunch at the kioskis...its their version of road side fast food... alot of fried fritter type food. The people of PR were wonderful and friendly. If you are a staying more than three days definitely rent a car. One word of caution, the drivers in PR are typical city drivers no worse than any New Yorker . But the roadways are not easy to navigate as their road signs are mininal/missing...none of the major atttractions had road signs!!!!

There is very little street noise when the balcony door is open, and no noise at all when it is closed. We found the service to be excellent.

He also kept an eye out for friends we'd met on the cruise who came by to have drinks with us by the pool and personally led them all the way to the bar at the rear of the property to meet us. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. The beds have down mattress pads, down comforters, and down pillows. The bathrooms are small but elegantly decorated, and the toiletries offered were so great that I brought all the leftovers home. The pool area and grounds are our favorite parts of the hotel. The landscaping can only be described as \"lush and abundant\" and the pool is gorgeous. There is a waterfall in the pool and plenty of lounge chairs so you can choose to lie in the sun or find a shady spot, and the beach is literally steps away from the pool. There are plenty of beach umbrellas and lounge chairs there and waiters to bring beverages. The only thing I might mention is that the food and drink at the hotel are quite expensive so keep that in mind when ordering at any of the poolside bars. A mojito in a fairly small plastic cup was $8 and beers were not much less.

The rest of the trip was spent at serene, out-of -the-way sort of places in Puerto Rico, so we were thoroughly rested and recharged when we arrived at this hotel. The people at the front desk are very well-trained and polite. We were a tad early and our room wasn't ready, so the bellman took our bags and we went out to the beach-side deck for burgers. When we got to our room an hour later, it was lovely. We had a 12th floor room with an ocean view. Outstanding! My only complaint was that the double beds seemed small for two people. There would have been enough room for slightly larger beds, I think. All the other room amenities were very nice. This otherwise lovely property was overrun by rude, arrogant, loud people from a certain East Coast major metropolitan area for the long MLK holiday weekend. They were their usual loud, pushy, obnoxious selves all weekend. Those people were on their Blackberrys and cell phones constantly, everywhere you went, including the pool area, so it was really difficult to relax. I could just feel my blood pressure going up. Several men even smoked cigars by the pool. I was disgusted by this. Who wants to smell that instead of the fresh sea breeze?It was really hard to move to another lounge chair, too, since it was extremely crowded and difficult to find a seat in the first place. Then, when I did find another seat that appeared free, some jerk pushed all my stuff on to the ground while I was swimming. Complaints to the staff elicited little more than shrugs. Later that evening, I went out on my hotel balcony, only to find a man on the balcony below and to the right completely nude and showing himself off to a cheering woman on the patio below. Revolting and low class (more of our countrymen from a certain major East Coast city). The pool is really nice (except they allow smoking anywhere), the beach was nice, too, but the water was full of seaweed. The food and drinks are very high-priced, but I knew this going in, so I sucked it up. I paid $23 for a very tasty quesadilla and Diet Coke. They add the 15% tip right into the bill, so just be aware. We had a rental car and know our way around San Juan pretty well, so we chose to take most of our meals off the property. The valet men were quick and efficient. No problems there. The other thing they get you with is one of those stupid \"resort charges\" of about $50 per night, so make sure you add that (and about another $50 in taxes) to whatever room rate you find online. Do not be fooled!!! This hotel is very close to the airport. This is good and bad. Good because it takes no time at all to get your rental car returned at to the airport, but bad because you can hear jets taking off all day. Not that big a deal, just something to know before you go. All in all, this was a lovely property with friendly staff, but I doubt we will ever go back. It's perfect for the loud, obnoxious city types requiring every luxury and used to paying exorbitant prices for everything, or for people who want to go to Puerto Rico but are too scared (which is silly) to venture outside of a resort. We'll be looking for something much less crowded, where quiet and solitude are more possible on our next trip. Lastly, we are Priority Club members, but we had no idea that Intercontinental hotels pay Priority Club points at a much lower rate than standard Holidays Inns.

All the staff were so very friendly and helpful. Even though all the rooms were booked the hotel did not seem crowded. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would return.

(We probably wouldn't have stayed here if paying full price...but for the price we got online it was phenomenal!) First--the hotel's in a fabulous location. It's a $12 cab ride to the airport, and $19 to Old San Juan. Taxis are readily available. There are a few restaurants across the street (Burger King, Church's Chicken, Subway, and La Casita for Mexican food), as well as a small grocery store. There's a Walgreen's within about a ten minute walk. Check-in was speedy. On arrival, we asked if any oceanview rooms were available and were told it'd be an extra $80/night (when we'd checked online before leaving home, it'd been higher.) We paid for the upgrade and were VERY happy with the room...14th floor with a great view of the pool, ocean, etc. The pool and beach are very clean, and we had no trouble finding lounge chairs. The hotel provides you with nice fluffy towels just as you're entering the pool area, which is very convenient. In our room, the beds were only mediocre, but everything else was so good it wasn't a big deal. There was even better-than-expected toiletries and the water pressure in the shower was great. The hotel was clean and the staff very attentive. We had to wait a couple times for the concierge, but she was helpful and informative about day trips, restaurants, etc. They have a computer next to the concierge desk that allows hotel guests to search for restaurants, activities, etc. all over Puerto Rico. It was very handy...even lets you see restaurant menus. We booked an all-day excursion via the concierge desk that took us to El Yunque, Luquillo Beach, and on a nighttime kayak ride to the bioluminescent bay in Fajardo. It was pricey, but well worth every penny. (The kayak ride in particular was phenomenal!) I was worried the kids (ages 6 and 9) wouldn't be able to go all day, and that the kayak might be too much, but they did fine and would do it all again. The tour guide the hotel uses, Joey, was fabulous and pointed out all kinds of things to the kids (even found them a coqui!) and made food suggestions to keep them happy. I also splurged and got a massage at the spa at the Intercontinental--VERY good massage, though not cheap! If you want to save $$, do NOT order at the pool bar. Drinks are very, very pricey. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurants other than at the outdoor cafe. A pizza there is $14. It looks like it's for one, but it's probably enough for two people (we had a LOT left over...could have saved $$$.) The food was very good, however, so no regrets! If you can book the Intercontinental the way we did (on a last minute deal) and save $$$, do it!

I do know that it is expensive, though. My in-laws are, well, wealthy, and this is their 5th time here.

The room is really clean and modern, and they have JUST put in brand-new flat screen TVs. They participate in a water saving program, so the sheets are not washed every day, which I appreciate as a green-thinking person. The food is excellent at the poolside bar, but crappy at the restaurant closer to the beach. They're about 50 feet away from each other, but the difference in quality is astounding. The staff is super friendly and the pool-side service is great. They have a cozy jacuzzi and the pool is nice although once the sun goes behind the hotel (around 3 pm) it is unbearably cold! The beach access is convenient, and such a treat. I prefer to go sunbathe all the way to the left, where the locals are hanging out.

We arrived on Saturday morning around 12pm but our room was not ready. We had lunch at the beach side cafe, pizza, burgers and stuff. the price was reflective of a higher end resort, but not too bad. Once we got in the room, it was huge in comparison to most other resorts I looked into. This is a resort to relax in, the one benefit for me was that there were not many, if at all children running around everywhere screaming. Mostly adults just lounging by the pool. The hotel also has it's own private beach area where the porter will place a lounge chair and umbrella where ever you would like. Nice touch. We also loved dealing with Hector at the concierge desk. He booked the Bio Bay tour in Farajdo (spelling?). This is a must if you are there and there is a new moon. This is a once in a life time experience, just be prepared, you have to kayak a good distance to the lagoon. But well worth the exercise. The pool area is great, a decent balance of sun and shaded areas. The pool never seemed over crowded, and chairs were amble. We had lunch at the pool (swim up) bar. I thought it was very reasonable considering it is the Intercontinental. I had the shrimp skewers and it was only $10 bucks. Now a waring, every soda refill cost. I was not used to this considering in the continental US, refills are usually free. Also I had a cocktail and was averaged price for a beach resort. What surprises me, is to read the other reviews and have people thinking that hotels are cheap. If you want cheap, stay at the Holiday Inn. You get what you pay for, and this resort is worth it. While we were there, we also look at other resorts to see about the competition. The property next door, the San Juan Resort and Casino, it is newer and glitzier, but the room are small. I would rather have a large room and comfortable bed than a shinny lobby. In conclusion, I would highly recommend this resort.

I arrrived into San Juan in the late afternoon, took the fixed rate taxi to the hotel, and was greeted warmly by the bell staff as they did each and every time I entered or departed the hotel. I was effeciently and pleasantly checked into my room #1123 by the front desk clerk. This very nice service is what I had remembered from a previous stay at another San Juan hotel, but, unfortunately this is where the friendly service ended at the Intercontinental San Juan. My room, although small, was cheerfully decorated and the bed was fluffy and comfortable with the bottom sheet completely covering the matress. The small balcony overlooked the street area and airport landing traffic (no problem with noise). I immediately noticed that the room contained nice bathroom amenities and plenty of towels, but, none of the usual Room Service Menu/Service Directory/Writing Paper portfolio. The room also had an ironing board but no iron. In calling for these items, I was told that the iron would be sent up but I would have to call the Business Center for the portfolio. Okay fine. Business Center says call Housekeeping, each time being asked, \"Anything else I can do for you?\" To me, this is the most frustrating situation with Customer Service. If you haven't been able to fullfill my request, don't ask if you can do anything else. I decided it was not that important to get the portfolio. As it turned out the iron was broken, but, was replaced quickly the next day. After a very long trip, I went to bed early but was awakened by loud voices in the hallway, mistaken phone calls and knocking at the door. After falling asleep again, I was awakened again by the 3 false fire alarms mentioned by a previous review. The next night did go much better with no alarms! My room was made up the second day very promptly after leaving for lunch and the Housekeeping department was quiet and unobtrusive. As mentioned in previous reviews,the beach at the Intercontinental is very nice and the hotel has great service for guests who wish to be served while in the sun. The pool is also very nice and security is tight, making it difficult for anyone who is not a regestered guess to be admitted. The gym is well-equipped, adequately air conditioned,and has a nice view of the beach, and is open 24-hours. The ice machine on my floor worked well and always had plenty of ice. As I stay in hotels about 12 nights a month, I have to say that the young lady at check out gets the award for the worst in the world. She was curt, rude, and did not even offer to show me a list of my charges prior to charging my card. She had no change in cash to accommodate my request for small bills acting as if this was a strange request for a hotel cashier. No thank you's or offers of assistance with bags from her. All of this after waiting 5 minutes for other clerk on duty to finish her personal conversation with a co-worker. All in all, this hotel is quite a blast from the past. I fully expected to see Lucy, Ethel, Fred and Ricky pass through the lobby while on their \"Puerto Rican Adventure.\" Truely a place where my Mom and Dad would have spent their honeymoon.

Would I go back? Yes. I really liked it. Pool: Not too big, but full of nooks and crannies for the children to explore. Anyone thinking of swimming laps should go to the beach. Several rocky waterfalls and small pools. Lots of deck chairs with large fluffy towels. Could use more umbrellas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the sun in Puerto Rico is HOT! Beach: Very close to the hotel. White sand, relatively clear warm water with a little sea weed form time to time. Small waves with not very much current. Nice beach. Restaurants Having read that the hotel food was expensive, I always ate outside. But I did notice that the priced menus weren't available before going into the restaurant. Always a sign of high prices. Also, poolside drinks were expensive, but many people brought their own drinks to the pool. Location: Great location. On the beach with numerous cheap or moderately priced restaurants nearby. We liked the Metropole best (a five minute walk) and for lunch the Mi Casita across the road. In the same strip mall as Mi Casita was a Chinese restaurant that was acceptable and a bakery for breakfast. Also across the road are many fast food places, if you can handle that. Also a small grocery across the road. The was airport noise, but we got used to it. Wasn't very loud in the rooms. Front Desk: A mixed bag. The men were usually very helpful and polite. They normally took the time to ask questions to find out what you really needed and offered solutions or alternatives \u00e2\u20ac\u201c always resulting is a satisfactory end. The women could use sensitivity training. The ladies were very business-like and while eventually helpful, not that friendly. I don't remember any of them saying good morning or please or thank you. When checking in at 13:00, I was reminded that check in is a 16:00. I asked for a room on a high floor and was advised that she couldn't guarantee anything until the rooms were clean (RIGHT!) Then having read in Trip Advisor about some rooms that were poorly air-conditioned, I asked about those undesirable rooms and asked her not to give me something that was the subject of complaints. She indicated that if there is a problem to call maintenance and they would fix it. (RIGHT!) She worked on her keyboard and suddenly a room was available on the 15th floor (GREAT!) Strange it wasn't available 2 minutes before. She suggested that I check back later to see if it was ready. When we did, it was ready at 14:00 (GREAT!) While I wouldn't seek this young lady again for help, in fairness, she was efficient \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but being friendly and polite would have given her high marks. Another engagement with the female front desk was over asking for change for a $50 bill. With a great rolling of the eyes she made sure that I knew how inconvenient it was for her. Pulled out different folders and consulted her colleges. At the end she gave me change. But really \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how difficult is it to break a 50? The hotel has a casino, after all. Concierge: The concierge had an A team and a B team. The A team was a man who was very helpful and polite. The B team was a woman who, although polite, was very useful. I was very upset with her one night when my son went downstairs to ask for some matches for a candle, the concierge sent him to the front desk, which sent him into a bar. She sent my 14 year old into a bar! The bar apparently couldn't help him either. So I confronted the concierge and finally a manager gave me some matches. Strangely, the next day I innocently asked the concierge, front desk and bar for matches and they found them right away. Housekeeping. Missed a few things upon occasion, but kept the room very clean. Extra towels were always there and she turned down the beds. Also cleaned the room at the time requested. Curb staff: The bell hops, bag handlers, cab callers were very professional and always helpful. Mostly young guys, the always looked happy, held open doors, greeted gusts. One of the best groups I have seen. Business Centre: Nice facility with reasonable charges. The lady managing the facility was very helpful and made several good suggestions. She knew her stuff. She was also very lovely and I went back several times to use the centre just to talk to her. Room Nice and spacious, but needed to be refreshed. Small balcony that we didn't use. The walls were a bit thin and some nights we could hear people next door or the TV. Normally turning on the air conditioning drowned out the noise. There was a space under the door of the thickness of a bic pen. As a result, all the hallway noise came into the room. I don't know why hotels have these spaces and its one of my pet peeves. TV didn't have all the channels that you would expect this type of hotel to have. Also, there wasn't a listing of the channels available.

It was our first vacation in San Juan Puerto Rico, and we absolutely cannot wait to go back! The hotel was everything we had hoped for and more. It's a short cab ride from the airport and we got to the hotel at 2pm. We were immediately greated warmly by several doorman, who unloaded our luggage. You'll never have to open the door to the hotel, both in and out! We originally had booked a room with a garden-view, but it was upgraded to an ocean-view on the 9th floor. The room was nice, with a small balcony. The view at night was awesome, although you did had to get use to the sounds of the many coqui's(tree frogs). At this point any stress you may have just simply melted away. The pool, swim-up bar, and jacuzzi was nice, as well as the many small waterfalls around the pool. It was never crowded, and lounge chairs were plentiful. The beach is right off the resort, and you can have someone assist you with setting up lounge chairs and umbrella. Another person came around and took orders for food and drinks-another great amenity. The food is expensive, but we decided to splurge anyway. We had ate at the resort's Japanese steakhouse, and Alfredo's(opened one week earlier). Again, it is expensive, but the food and service was excellent. We went on two excursion's-the rain forest and horseback riding on the beach. The tour guide on the rain forest was fantastic-his name was Hector, and he took us on side tours on his own. He talked to us on the mic the whole way, giving us a history lesson on Puerto Rico and its people and customs. We visited the Bacardi Rum factory also. We took a cab ride($19)to the ferry in Old San Juan, took the ferry across(I think it was $1.50 round trip), then another cab ride($3) to the distillery. The tour there was for free, and each adult received two tickets to sample free drinks. We went into Old San Juan twice. Calle Fortaleza is the main street where you can find many shops and restaurants. The architect of the old buildings and cobblestone streets takes you back in time. We ate at the Parrot Club, which was recommended by a Cigar shop merchant. You can take a cab to Plaza Colon($19)from the hotel and walk up Calle Fortaleza to Plaza de Armas. There's an area here that you can feed the hundred's of pigeons-it was amazing. An old woman was selling feed for $1, and the pigeons are walking around your feet, waiting to be fed. Lots of folks from the cruise ships frequent the area around Plaza de Armas. You can find the outlet stores here(Coach,etc.), which is located on Calle Cristo street(make a right off Calle Fortaleza)Further up a hill on Calle Cristo(past the Coach outlet store), you will find the El Morro Fortress to the left. For $5 you can visit this fort as well as the San Crist\u00c3\u00b3bal Fort, which is located behind Plaza Colon. It takes a few hours of exploring one fort. The difference between the two is that El Morro is much higher. All in all, the trip was great(can you tell?), the hotel was super, the people were very nice. We cannot wait to go back!

We didn't splurge on the room because we never planned on being there very much. If you get a room with a city view, don't plan on sitting on the balcony. You will be lucky to get one person out there. We were so tired everynight that we never noticed the planes. They did come clean our room everyday and we were there for 5 days. Very nice towels. The staff is helpful but don't count on getting an upgrade to a room. You have to be very lucky and it does not matter how much you tip. The food is high and so so. Your best bet is to walk across the street and chose something from there. Make sure you learn spanish. 4 places that we ate they couldn't understand us, because they didn't know english. MUST DO's El Morro Castle, great history and very cheap trip, Old San Juan was great and lots of great shops. Be prepared to do alot of walking. TAKE A CAB!!!. We went to El Morro & Old San Juan on the same day and we took a cab there and back. Yes it cost $19.00 each way. It only took us 15 minutes to get there and back. There was a nice place to eat at in Old San Juan and great view. It was called Cafe Amapola. Great beans and rice! If you like to really shop then go to the Plaza Del Americus shopping mall. Again it will cost you $19.00 each way and it took us 10-15 minutes to get there. It is worth it unless you have alot of time and patience for a 45minute or longer bus ride. Be prepared to walk. It is 3 levels and I love to shop, but I never seen the 3rd level because I was sick of shopping. You will get lost there. MORE MUST DO'S ---scubba diving, my husband loves it and has been several times. He booked it with CoQui Dive and it was well worth the money and he got 2 dives at 2 different places in the same trip/day. He said it was the best he had ever done or seen.

During the first stay, they upgraded me to a suite right next to the pool that was a room of the quality you would see on MTV Cribs! This was amazing! I suspect they did this because it was my first stay at an Intercontinental Resort and Holiday Inn wanted me to keep coming back. However, on the second stay, I was in a typical room ... which was nothing special. The hotel has one of the nicest pools with beach entry that you will find on the beachy section of Puerto Rico. There is a nice bar area in the middle where you can sit and have one of the weakest $9 drinks you will ever get. However there are plenty of lounge chairs to lay out on and a nice (but crowded pool.) The hotel room (I am reviewing the standard room here ... if you have the money to get a pool side suite, you will thank yourself as the suite was one of the nicest hotel rooms I've stayed in anywhere) ... had yellowish stucco walls and medditeranian style furniture. It didn't really make me feel comfortable being in there for some reason. There was a balcony that overlooked the street (they were booked up and could not move me to one that overlooked the ocean in the back). The bed was comfortable but the room just lacked style. It felt like one of those cheap Florida condos. The bathroom was small and cheap looking. The location is good if you want to be on the beach. It isn't very glamorous. It reminds me a little of Atlantic City. The casino inside the hotel is small and there are a few good (but very overpriced restaurants). There is a Palm Steakhouse and a Japanese Hibachi style restaurant. The area around the hotel is pretty run down ... if you want to go to Old San Juan where the cruise ships dock, it will cost you about $15 for a cab there. It is several miles away. The weird thing is that the airport is only 1 or 2 miles away from the hotel yet because Puerto Rico charges cabfare by the zone, you will still pay $15 to get there. The hotel overall is kept up pretty nicely. If you can talk yourself into the club lounge (Priority Club) they have great hors d'erves and an open bar! The lobby area and casino area of the hotel are fairly classy and it does feel a little upscale. However, I wouldn't be comfortable paying more than $150 - $175 a night for the hotel based on what you get. If you are looking for nightlife and the real old side of San Juan instead of the beach/pool scene ... this is not the place for you.

At one point we asked her about the Metropol restaurant recommended by the cabbie. She turned up her nose and said 'no way'. We went anyway and it was the best meal of the trip. The location close to the airport was not a problem. You could hear the planes take off and land, but not obtrusively so. The hotel is in a fairly busy area of town, so if you want total island seclusion this is not the place. It's definitely worth paying the extra price for upper floor, ocean view. The lower floor views are blocked by palm trees, and the view on the non-ocean side is bleak at best. My main complaint with the hotel is the lack of affordable restaurants and bars. The beach restaurant was the cheapest but had a very limited menu. They don't post the prices on the drinks and we were surprised to find on our bill some of the drinks were $14. Non-alcoholic slushees for the girls were $6 each. The hotel restaurants (Ruth's Chris and Momoyama {Japanese}) were in the $$$$ category. The third restaurant (ultra-high end Italian) was under renovation. We simply could not afford to eat at the hotel as a family of 4 without breaking the bank. At the hotel bar, a single shot of Don Q Crystal at $8. I could go across the street and buy a full pint for $4. There was not option for breakfast other than room service and the $17/person buffet. We ended up going to the store and buying cereal and milk to eat in the room. All in all, for our first trip to Puerto Rico, this was a great hotel even considering my 'complaints'.

The restaurant is on the beach, which is nice, but the food is gross bar food and pricey. The 3 of us had nachos, a few drinks, a couple of sandwiches and quesadillas for 140 dollars! The manager has an attitude but our waitress was very nice. This hotel is directly next door to the El San Juan hotel and we had breakfast across the street at a strip mall everyday. The 3 of us had breakfast for 13 including tip. I am not cheap, but I just do not like being taken advantage of, which I felt I was at the hotel. As mentioned, the pool area(which would not let us bring our own drinks and wants us to buy their overpriced drinks) and the private beach are very nice.

The location is great as the hotel is surrounded by many other resorts, restaurants and shops that are all in walking distance. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant so I cannot comment on that, but there are several great little local places nearby. There is a great place for breakfast or lunch called Piu Bella. It is probably a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel and the prices are very reasonable. For dinner I would highly recommend the Metropol restaurant.

We had a great time,,, after reading recent reviews I was very nervous about what to expect.. But the hotel was nice pleasant workers esp concierge,, And I believe it was Fernando at the front desk that gave us a FREE ocean view upgrade for our honeymoon, which saved us $80 a night!! The pool was nice, the food was good at the cafe/bar outside,, try a cuban sandwich, Its pricey so we only are there twice. The drinks are pricey also. To eat outside the hotel there are local fast food places and small eateries just across the street., Try Mi Casita across the street for PR food, my husband is PR and he loved it. Parking- we did the self park a lot cheaper than valet and the parking lot is right across the small road, (be careful ppl arent to worried about practically running over the tourists and the cross walk). Casino is small, next door and the El San Juan is a bit bigger. They seemed to have DJ's at their pool in the evening myay try that hotel next time. The hotel will give you directions to the rainforest, The largest mall in the Carribean, the bacardi factory and Old San Juan (we had a rental car) The direction arent very exact , need more of exits and landmarks to get you some places. the rainforest is nice but go early the trails are apart from each other and you need to drive up the mountian to them. But there is no big park sign like you would think to find it.. its right up a small Pr town street that you may pass right up, but dont worry youre going the right way. Its just a little diff then what you would look for at home. Also things close at 6pm, the rainforest, shops of Old San Juan, the forts in Old San Juan, the bacrardi factory,, (watch that exit also). So go early if you can, I spent my morning sun bathing and swimming. The ocean is beautiful!!! Also try Lupis to the left of the hotel its a mexican rest with some Pr flare to it. They have burgers also , cute bar and restaurant. We ate at Ruth Chris steak house at the hotel, its expensive but the steak was awesome!! Ive never had steak without steak sauce. But its about $30-50 a steak and all sides and salads are extra so be prepared. This hotel is literally a few miles from the hotel it took us 6 mins to get there and back for our flight- car rental was also so simple if you decide to do that. But driving is CRAZY!!!!! It seems theres no organization at ALL and the highways get very backed up so if youre rushing somewhere give yourself time to get there. They dont use turn signals and will cut you off like its nothing so watch ALL LANES while you drive!!

Let me preface this by saying that the staff at the hotel couldn't be nicer. They were polite, helpful and friendly. The room, (we had a standard) could definitely use an overhaul. The size was generous, but the furnishings were tired looking. The couch was saggy, and the bed had the same tired looking bedspread that weighed a ton. I don't understand why a hotel in the tropics would not opt for lighter, more attractive bedding to enhance the appearance of the room. The bathroom ,again generous in size, had poor lighting. Ths shower was almost dungeon like. There was no magnifying make-up mirror, so ladies, if you need that to primp, you may want to bring your own. Due to the poor lighting, I had to purchase a mirror and apply my make-up at the the desk. The pleasantness came to a streaking halt as the Friday of Memorial Day weekend was upon us. Hello Coney Island! The guests that came at that point were loud, played radios on the beach, and left their garbage strewn all over the place. I felt sorry for the staff . At that point, I was happy to be leaving the following day. That same night, our neighbors were blasting music at midnight and proceeded to deny it to the security staff that I had to call. I would go back, during a quiet week. If you are looking to relax without the NY/NJ crowd, make sure you do not going during a busy time. ( I am a New Yorker by the way) You may definitely want to try some of the local restaurnats as the hotel food is quite expensive.

I cant say enough about the service here, it was TOP NOTCH!! We barely had to lift a finger here, they did it all for us!! We ended up at this resort because we originally booked at the Marriott and left after a hellish firt night there. Because of our last minute change, we couldnt get into our room for a couple of hours, but they offered us a hospitality room to get situated in and change for the beach. When our room was ready, they brought our luggage up for us and even stored my husband's golf bags for us in their storage area (not at our request) so we wouldnt be inconvenienced with having them in the room with us! Our room was nicely appointed and comfortable. Bathroom was a bit on the smaller side, but it never was an issue for us. Over all we were quite comfortable in our room. The grounds here are beautiful, we LOVED the pool (it was huge)and we were even more enthralled with the beautiful BEACH!! Spots at the pool were definitely a hot commodity; I got up at 7 am one morning to jog on the beach and guests were already saving spots!! They have awesome cabana like set ups at the pool, but only about 5 of them and they were almost always taken, especially over the weekend. The pool has a great swim up bar with flat screen tvs and bartenders that are ready to serve you!! The beach is equally beautiful - the only downfall here is that you have to pay 10 bucks to rent an umbrella. But, its worth it. The sand is so soft and the water is so warm. There is also a beach bar/restaurant that serves great food and drinks...try the salads here, they are WONDERFUL!! Also, try to get Katherine as your server...she is prompt, friendly, and always smiling! We loved her!! We had breakfast in the restaurant thats on the lower level (cant remember the name) but it was delicious.

The Casino is great has a variety of slot machines to choose from, along with free drinks, regardless of what your playing.

But from the moment arrived, it was one problem after another. We got to the hotel at 12:30pm on Thursday and being Ambassador Members, we are able to check in early if the room is ready. The room wasn't ready but the snide front desk man told us it would be ready no later than 4:00pm but to check in with him around 3:00pm. We grabbed some lunch but didn't want to change into our suits because we figured it wouldn't take too long to get to our room. So, we wasted time, got some groceries across the street, and checked back at 2:50pm. He said the room wasn't ready yet and to check back in another half hour. 3:30pm we went back and he gave my boyfriend some very different news. The front desk admitted to him that our room had been taken by a flight crew and since their flight was delayed out of San Juan, they got the room until it was ready for them to head back to the airport. They told us it would be no later than 6:30pm. Yes, 6:30pm. So, after a morning of flying, three hours of wasting time, they now tell us that it would be another 3 hours until we were able to check in. My boyfriend came outside with this news to me and I went back in to talk to the manager. She was the most unapologetic manager I had ever encountered. She kept telling me that she had another room for us, but it was lower than the room class we reserved and we didn't want that room. We wanted the room class that had been promised to us when we checked in that afternoon. She offered nothing more than \"There's nothing else I can do for you, you're going to have to wait until these people leave your room\". After five minutes of this conversation that got nowhere, I finally told her that I was frustrated with her customer service and that usually in circumstances like this, you say \"Let me give you breakfast or here some gambling vouchers, I'm sorry this has been hard but I'm trying to make it up to you.\" She replied \"Well, I didn't know if you liked breakfast. What are you looking for?\" I told her that since she saw our reservation the next night at Ruth Chris, she should pick up the bill as a sign of good-will. She put a cap of $200 on the bill and then further added \"That $200 is for food only. You will pay for liquor and taxes and tip.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We finally changed into our suits and sat around until 6:30pm. The room still wasn't ready. We got into our room at 7:30pm that night. Our TV wasn't working when we finally got to our room. We called and they sent someone up to reprogram it. That wasted another 15 minutes. We called it a night and went to bed. Friday was a good day other than the fact that they didn't put down \"couple's massage\" for the $360 massage package we got and they led us into separate rooms. I spoke up and they took us back to the waiting room to wait ten minutes until the couple's room was set up. We got back to the room after the massage to sleep and 5 minutes later, the fire alarm went off. We walked down the 8 flights just to be told at the bottom that it was just a drill and to go back upstairs. Sunday morning we pulled the tv out on the tv tray to watch from bed and (I kid you not) the tv wasn't screwed into the tray so this tv came tumbling down to the ground smashing on the floor. We had to call downstairs, they sent up security, then an insurance guy to take pictures, and then we had to sit and wait until another tv came up. He said it was all set. When we went to try it, the remote didn't work and we had to call again to have someone reprogram the tv. We finally checked out on Monday and they had charged us for a movie we never watched. We very nicely disputed it but she kept the charge on there. Finally I asked for a print out of the movies and she said \"Oh, well, you are spending a lot of money here. I'll just take the $14 off the bill.\" Oh and also, we had to get our keys reprogrammed every day because they kept getting demagnetized. This trip really was a series of unfortunate events. We were able to laugh at a lot of it just to keep our sanity and our vacation mode going, but to be put through all of that hassle and pay so much money was just truly disappointing. Especially where we are Ambassador members and have spent over $10,000 at IC hotels. Honestly, we really are not hard to please. We take most things in stride. But to be lied twice at check-in? That's something we couldn't take. The hotel was in good shape, the pool was nice, the food at Ruth Chris and the Palm were awesome, and the hotel was in a good location.

It would be really helpful if people rated a hotel, service and their overall stay with a little more objectivity. We just returned from 8 days and 7 nights at the IC and had a wonderful time. Here's my objective ratings based upon numerous stays at hotels ranging from the Four Seasons to Holiday Inn Express. The InterContinental San Juan Resort, Spa & Casino is not a Four Seasons but then again I did not pay Four Seasons rates. It also not a Holiday inn Express - the IC is much better. The reasons people go to the Caribbean - sun and fun! Weather 4.5 stars - rained one day with a few showers on two other days (no big deal). Other than that the weather was outstanding - not too hot just right. Pool - 5 stars - 99.5% complete with a little grout sealing being performed, however, it was not intrusive at all. We had as many towels as we wanted and the chairs were very comfortable and clean. Drinks and food at the pool and beach were very good. Nice place to seat after dark if you like the sound of the surf as you have an after dinner cocktail. Beach - 4 stars - there was a lot of seaweed in the water for about 25 feet. The beach was clean but there were a few sand fleas. The hotel provided \"bug\" spray. The water was warn and clear once you waded past the seaweed. The restaurant was a nice place to sit after dark if you like the sound of the surf as you have an after dinner cocktail. Hotel staff service - 5 stars. Everyone was attentive and very helpful. Hotel property in general 3.5 stars - public areas clean and well maintained. Rating was impacted down a little due to the quality of the rooms (see below). Hotel rooms 3 stars - adequate (how much do you really stay in the room). Need to be spruced up. Bathrooms adequate but really needs to be updated. Not sure how they can be since they are small and there is no room to expand. Food at the hotel (beach) - 4 stars (again this is at the beach not a 4 star restaurant like the Palm's - need to but everything into perspective).

The pool area, recently re-done (tile work) was just as pretty. THe staff works very hard. They are constantly bending over picking up vacationers junk and throwing it away- shame on the tourists- pick up your own garbage. I have to say, there were families there who were definetly there for their own pleasure. They let their children scream by the pool all day. I actually watched 1 family wake up about 10 vacationers sleeping by the pool around 4 pm one afternoon - unacceptable, not because of the hotel but because of parents with no manners. The staff was very good, the concierge great. The front desk and the doormen wonderful.

What a great place. We stayed there from January 6--9th, 2007 to celebrate our anniversary. Our first visit was in January 2001. I can only agree wholeheartedly with the positive reviews this hotel has received. Our experiences both on this trip and in 2001 were first rate. Let me start by saying that I am VERY particular and I pay attention to detail. In fact , I think of myself as an unpaid AAA hotel critic, with lots of experience but no salary. We booked an ocean view room at $350 per night, including breakfast. Not cheap, but all of the top places in San Juan that I checked also seemed very expensive. They also charge the very annoying add-on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort fee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (as do many other hotels.) which can cause some sticker shock when checking out. Nevertheless, we decided to splurge\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand are very glad we did. The hotel staff learned we were celebrating our anniversary and boy did they roll out the red carpet. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe their generosity and thoughtfulness. They upgraded us to a huge suite in the club area\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust beautiful and extremely comfortable. And not only did they give us complimentary fruit and chocolate covered strawberries, they also sent us bottle of champagne that was listed at $100 on the room service menu. Wow--did we feel like VIPs. Just for future reference, I walked around the hotel and checked out the standard rooms. The rooms were clean and in good shape, and the hallways were also in good condition. The rooms are average comfortable size, though the bathrooms are somewhat small, and each room has a small balcony. The balconies are really nice to have instead of the typical sealed up room. You can open your door in the morning and let in the balmy Puerto Rican breezes. Wish I was there right now with a cup of Joe. The breakfast buffet was open air, which we prefer in the tropics, with lots of choices including an omelet /egg station. The hotel has a casual restaurant / bar right smack dab on the beach, with some tables actually in the sand. Fabulous location and worth a visit. The food was OK, but pricy, e.g., chicken burger about $13, but unbeatable atmosphere. There is an Italian restaurant, although it was closed for renovation. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try the on-site Ruth Chriss Steak House. We tried the casino, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much luck. The lobby is quite stylish and up-to-date, with lots of activity. The pool area was beautiful, with a cool swim-up bar, poolside restaurant with an outdoor bar-b-q chef on duty, which was a great idea. Apparently the entire pool area had just been renovated. When we were there we had no problems finding a place to sit or swim as some prior reviews mentioned. The multiple pool areas and hot tub are big and beautifully landscaped. One of the best restaurants we ate at on the trip was the Metropole, which is a very popular local\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s institution. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a five minute walk from the hotel. The place gets quite crowded but worth the wait. They serve terrific (and very inexpensive) Cuban/Puerto Rican food. Turn left out of the hotel, cross the street and the restaurant is just past the cockfighting stadium (we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop in there.) The hotel concierge, Jossell, couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been more helpful. (In fact, the service at the hotel was terrific from everyone we encountered.) Jossell recommended a kayak outing to the bioluminescent bay (only at night), which was a great experience, even though we had never been kayaking before. I think the best time to go, if your timing is right, is on a moonless night.

You can get a table in the shades under palm trees or under the straw huts next to the beach. No matter where you sit, enjoy the ocean breeze with their famous drink - the Mudslide.

My GF and I decided to take a last minute trip to escape the NYC cold. The El San Juan was booked up and I do not think the Ritz is worth the money due to the fact that San Juan has a foul smelling beach. I am not sure where other reviewers get their opinion of the water here but trust me as I have seen some nice beaches THIS is NOT ONE OF THEM. It is filled with seaweed and smells like bad fish. Our experience began with American Airlines canceling our 6 am flight to San Juan and taking the liberty to rebook us on a 9PM flight. Our travel agent was able to get that taken care of. Once we arrived at the airport we discovered that the flight was severely over booked. terrible turbulence and a great deal of screaming children later we finally arrived at the lovely hotel. After tipping the girl at the front desk we waited only about ten minutes for a room. We were rewarded with one of the highest non smoking ocean view rooms in the place. Lucky us it was on the fourth floor overlooking the main roof of the building. I am sure if the palm trees, the bars, the pool side cafe, the vines, and jungle all fell down there would be a nice ocean view but i Could not see it from my vantage point. One quick trip to the front desk and we were changed to a smoking room on the eighth floor. The hallways smelled of cigars but the room was not at all smoky. My thoughts on the rooms are as follows : The bathroom is too small. The ceiling in the shower is so low that you cant really move around. The door swings open into the space and doe not allow for you to move around in the bathroom. All of the outlets were old and did not even hold onto some plugs. The bed was an old fashioned box spring mattress that had definitely taken a few beatings in its life time. To its is pointed in the direction of the balcony ( so small it should be called a ledge) I think its this was because there is no room to position it other wise. The rooms has a lovely alarm clock CD player that will keep you up at night due to the fact it searches for CD tracks even though the cd is off and nothing is in it. There is a fridge so stock up on water at the supermarket because you may tend to think its free being that the Intercontinental left no price list for items in the fridge. Also there are no prices on the spa menu either. I must say that they do offer a continental breakfast. I think they should call it the Intercontinental Breakfast because they charge for everything so whats the point? I understand that looking at the room service that the going rate for a 1 muffin + I yogurt + two eggs + coffee and juice is now $19 + $ Service fee + 19% gratuity. So these few kinks had me a little annoyed but its was nothing we could not deal with. Having been up since early morning we decided to go by the pool. The pool is lovely the water is a bit cool for some but i loved it. The food pool side is however over priced and not of the quality they should serve given the money the charge. $15 dollar nachos were among my favorite along with the $13 cheese burger that had more chunks of crap in it than anything. They do have a nice BBQ at poolside that has a man with a chef hat doing something. Except when you order your food from the \"grill\" menu it comes from inside. The frozen drinks were nice but beware they constantly offer a little extra rum etc which they do charge you for. Also the hotel has taken the liberty of adding their own gratuity onto the bill and then putting a line for additional gratuity. That being said just as i fell asleep poolside i was woken by a lovely woman speaking on here phone about the Barry Manilow Concert she had just attended at a volume not fit for vacation. The worst thing ever done was not making a PR a place where you must pay for roaming. The catch phrase poolside was \" Call me its free\" I am sure this is because everyone wants to hear people chatting it up poolside with their friends back home. There were also a huge number of kids. I love the little ones but there were just so many that they took over the pool. There was hot tub but so many people were in it that I feel it was dirty. Also children were constantly in it even though it specifically says no kids. On the other hand there were a lot of over tanned fat people. When i say fat I am not trying to be mean but the obesity that surrounded this pool made it look like a lake in the Serengeti where hippos would wash. Our first night we had dinner at the Palm which was good if not for the drunken rowdy business people. Take note that from my observation the Intercontinental caters only to business people being that they have a special club for them. They also in my eyes write allot of the reviews here. Hey I would like the place too if my boss was paying. But since I am the boss I think its a huge rip off. The following was so funny I could not bear the get mad that it happened. At 1 am the fire system had a false alarm. Which sent me jumping from my bed like a madman. This alarm system they have is more like an air raid signal. I was convinced we were under attack. It subsided after about a minute. I put my head back down on the lumpy pillow and fell right to sleep. Despite the fact the air conditioner is directly over the bed. Which is nice because cold air does drop down and give you the chills who wouldn't want cold air pumping on their body all night. As i reached my third dream the Air raid signal came on again. This time its was followed with a please evacuate the building warning. Which was lovely and I must say that if you think these hotties look good by the pool (yuck) you should see them in their night things. After walking down the eight flights of stairs and through the back of house we arrived at the pool and were instructed to wait there by a man who then left for a half hour. Finally one of the tourists decided it was safe to go back in the building and we all lined up for the elevator. Since only tow of the three were working for the trip we opted for the stairs. So now that they got false alarm number two out of the way we headed back to go to sleep. I felt that we were owed some type of reimbursement for our troubles. The hotel felt differently. But Assuming it was a false alarm the first time the fire system should have been put on test. That being said we were allowed to sleep in for the rest of the trip. Although since the wooden doors only close when you slam them expect to be woken by people going out to reserve spots by the pool. Also spots on the beach that they hold while they are at the pool or at wendys across the street while they buy themselves some nice treats. Overall the pool is crowded with \"taken\" chairs which never materialize any real people. I decided that since Sunday was our last day we would got to Condado to shop at Cartier Louis V etc. So we asked the concierge to see if everything was open. She assured us it was and we hopped in a cab and took the 5 minute ride to Condado to discover that everything was closed. So we took and round trip ride that cost $30 and produced nothing. The Casino is like a nightmare. I have seem better gaming in the back of bars here in NYC. The machines are mostly broken. Or maybe they shut them down if they pay out? Not sure but beware the El San Juan is just a minute away and their Casino is nice. Perhaps they will set up a shell game or three card monty in the lobby because thats the level of gaming to expect from this hotel. Overall I cant say anything bad about the people that work there. The bellmen and the staff are really sweet people working for a living. The hotel chain is horrible. They do nothing for their guests. I love the option of paying for turn down service as well every other thing real hotels do as a courtesy for their guests. Being the people who work there recommend other hotels I guess its fair to saw we have been duped by the intercontinental. Next time I will stay in Fajardo or the El San Juan.

I would definitely return. It is pricey, but so are alot of the hotels. The pool are is amazing! There are many fast food places within walking distance. Isla Verde beach is very nice.

When I called to make a reservation I was told that the Garden/Executive Suite were worth the extra money b/c they have private gardens.

Unfortunately all of the garden rooms except maybe for one or two do not get much sunlight. The room and the hallway smelled like a moldy basement.

We negotiated to stay at the same price we were paying for the Executive Suite. SO basically we got ripped off. And then to top it off there is a resort fee which I believe was $30 a day, this was not mentioned at anytime prior to our trip.The ocean view room had a nice view, but it was outdated and the patios are so small you cant really sit comfortably on the patio. The pool although looks nice, is overcrowded and to small for the number of people it accomodates. the place is filled with children, and the Jacuzzi was luke warm and also had a foul smell to it (it too is in the shade most of the day.

The pool was great...swim-up bar was still closed...looked like it was nearing completion though. The room was pretty nice. The bed was very comfortable.

The sliding glass door to the balcony is big enough to be able to open and enjoy the balcony from inside the room anyways. The concierge was very helpful. Helpful tip (which he will tell you if you ask): don't take the $70 tour to Old San Juan, the Forts...take the bus there for 75 cents, and take the taxi back (about $20) cause you will probably be tired after spending the day there.

It does have a couple of high points but is in need of much work. Here is my breakdown after spending a week at the hotel. Rooms: The rooms are in pretty run down condition. They are old and outdated and not very clean. Probably the worst part of the entire hotel is the rooms. They need a lot of work. All rooms ending in 05 such as 1405 are very small because of the stairwell. Stay away from these rooms. The city view side is not bad it does face the airport a couple of blocks away but the windows are fairly well insulated. You do have a distant view of the bay. Casino: The casino is very run down compared to the neighboring hotels the Ritz, El San Juan and Courtyard. We did not win any money at the IC but did well at all the other casinos. It is very smoky, full of rowdy locals and many of the machines do not work. Beach: The beach is nice for a fairly poputated stretch ot sand. Water and sand are both clean. Warm water in November probably around 80 degrees. There are reefs right off the beach here but not recommended to snorkel due to motor boats and jet skis. The beach is a big plus. Chairs from the IC and umbrellas are free. Pool: Was closed and has been closed for a couple of months they keep backing up the reopening date from early OCt to late to mid of November. The current condition is probably reflective of a December opening. It looks like it is nice but not open. Many checking in were very upset and we witnesses many confrontations with management because they were not disclosing this if you already had reservations. It is in very small print on their website. Surroundings: It is San Juan. Probably not the safest of cities. But we felt safe walking at night in the immediate 10 blocks of the hotel. There were a lot of police patroling the streets. You just have to be smart you do not want to be walking around by your self or with all your money on you.

The difference was simply that the deluxe city view was on a higher floor (5 and above) instead of (2 - 4). Our view was actually very nice. We could see the airplanes as they landed and when there were no planes you actually had a distance (very distance) ocean view. The hotel is only 10 minutes from the airport but the noise of the planes didn't bother us. Others have written that the walls of the hotel rooms are thin, that is correct. The noise didn't really bother me as much as it bothered by roommate. One thing that annoyed us both was the television speaker in the bathroom. It was loud and intrusive. We actually had the maintenance staff cut it off. Instructions should have been left for the guests so we could have cut it off ourselves.

The reviews I read on Trip Advisor prior to going are very accurate. I cannot say enough about this Hotel and about Puerto Rico. This was my first trip to Puerto Rico, accompanied by my kids, 19 & 17 and my mom. The most extraordinary thing about this hotel, as others have raved, is the service. I have stayed in many five star hotels and the service at this hotel exceeded all of them. The reason this hotel probably gets the four star rating is because the rooms could definitely use a little updating. Instead of two full size mattresses, they should splurge and get queens. This is one of my two complaints from this trip (I will share the second complaint later)! Our check-in was very quick and being the hotel is five minutes from the airport, our flight landed at 1 pm and we were in our room by 1:45pm. We had a problem with our in-room safe and within 2 minutes someone came to fix it. We also did not have enough towels and within 2 minutes of calling the front desk, the towels were delivered clean & hot right out of the dryer. The front desk even called one minute after receiving the towels to make sure that they arrived. Every single employee in this hotel was friendly and helpful. A room with a view of the ocean is a must!!! The extra money spent for this was worth it. We were overlooking the ocean and the pool - definitely heaven on earth! We ate at Momoyama/Japanese, which was okay. However, Pasaggio/Italian should not be missed. We ate the breakfast buffet at La Terrazza, which was pricey and just okay. The restaurant by the beach - Meditteranian was one of our favorites for lunch with a view to die for and excellent salads. The pool area was beautiful and clean. My second complaint about this hotel was definitely the prices of the drinks. It cost $8.00 for a beer by the pool, which was the same as a mixed drink. I think this was the most I ever paid for a beer. It is recommended to go across the street to the supermarket and purchase snacks and your beer there, where you will pay $8.00 for a six pack. Some of the local places to make note of was Platos for local food, which was excellent (a few blocks from the El San Juan hotel) and Piu Bello for coffee and ice cream (also a few blocks from the El San Juan - make a left out of the InterContinental). The bakery across the street that others have raved about in the reviews has great food, but unfortunately we had terrible service - it is probably best to order your food at the counter. We went to Mi Casita Restaurant - next to the bakery for breakfast one morning and the service and food were horrible - everything was ice cold. Being New Yorkers - I guess we are not used to the slow, very laid back service. STAY AWAY FROM THE PONDEROSA STEAKHOUSE FOR BREAKFAST - we found out the hard way. On our trip we visited the El Yunque Rainforest , which was great. We spent an afternoon in Old San Juan, which was fantastic - great shopping, however, the stores close too early - around 6 pm. We ate in a great restaurant in Old San Juan - Barrachina, which claims to be the home of the original Pina Colada - and they were the greatest!

I chose the IC San Juan because of its location, and the positive reviews I read here. I booked through Orbitz, and the website didn't tell me what the rooms actually were (city view, ocean view, etc.) so I chose the most expensive, assuming that it would be an Ocean View - it was. We arrived after a very short $10 cab ride from the Airport, and the porters took our bags immediately. We checked in (Rm. 1022), and we had hardly walked into the room before someone called asking if it was ok to bring the bags up now. About 2 minutes later our bags arrived. The room was great, just what I expected. The king size bed was very comfortable, the safe and fridge worked, and the AC was quiet and very cold. The balcony was admittedly small, but adequate. The sliding glass doors block out most of the outdoor noise, including the occasional plane taking off or landing. Contrary to what some others have said, I did not have any problem with noise. I could occasionally hear doors slam, or hear a muffled conversation from next door, but it certainly didn't keep me up at night, or bother me in the slightest. The beach was nice and clean, and not crowded. The pool, while we did not use it, looked amazing, and all the gardens and the trees really made us feel like we were in a tropical paradise. In the hotel, we ate at Momoyama (Japanese), Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, and Ciao Mediterranean Cuisine (right on the beach). We also ate at the Palm and Sunny's Ocean Terrace restaurant, both a short walk down the beach. Most of the food was expectedly expensive, but it was all good. I especially recommend lunch at the Ciao Mediterranean place, their lunch is very fairly priced and the food was excellent. Try the Cuban Sandwich! For cheap food, just head right across the road. There's a plaza with a Supermarket, Subway, Burger King, Church's Chicken, a great bakery, etc., and right down the road there are even more fast food options (KFC, Taco Bell etc.), if you want to save some money. The casino was nice, a little smoky, but we had fun regardless. Nestor, at the Concierge desk filled us in about travel to and from Old San Juan. The bus stops about 1/10th of a mile from the IC San Juan every 20 minutes, and costs .75 per person, exact change. It takes about 30 minutes (depending on traffic) to make it from there to the end of the line, which is just below Old San Juan, where the cruise ships dock. You can take a trolley from there. A cab ride to or from Old San Juan is around $20. Nestor also booked us for a kayak trip in Fajardo, at night, to see the bioluminescent bay there. It was such an incredible experience, we'll never forget it. We also visited El Yunque rain forest (via Rico Suntours through Orbitz). There are lots of trails to explore, and really amazing sights. Everyone we came in contact with in Puerto Rico (and especially at the Intercontinental San Juan) was very polite and helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel/resort to anyone looking for a clean, comfortable, friendly and conveniently located place to stay near San Juan.", "Date": "July 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!\u201d", "Author": "my3ds", "ReviewID": "UR5504239", "Content": "We just returned from staying at the Intercontinental.

We ended up on the 6th floor and you could still see the ocean. Definitely get an oceanview room if you stay, like everyone says. We had a hospitality room when we arrived on the city side. No comparison. Also when we left we received a hospitality room on the 16th floor ocean view...WOW! I see why its the \"higher\" the better. You could see the whole beach and beyond from this room. It was just gorgeous. I saw nothing wrong with the lobby, I thought the hotel was very nice and clean, and the grounds were beautiful. The pool was really nice (and clean) too, although we are beach people and never went in! Food is what everyone says, expensive at the hotel (but good!), and so many ways to work around this. We went to Mi Casita for many inexpensive meals and thought it was great. Metropol (for cuban) is also just a short walk away. The location of this hotel was excellent. On one of the days we rented a car and drove ourselves to Old San Juan, defintely worth the short trip to this beautiful city. Then we drove to Fajardo and did the kayak bio bay tour.

Save your money and go to the excellent restaurants in the evening (Pikayo, Lemongrass, or some good ones on OSJ like Parrot Club). The room was not fancy but very comfortable.

The location is good because it is right on Isla Verde Beach as it is hard to park a car in this part of town just to use the beach. The water here is very clean and blue-green, not clear as it is on other islands in the Caribbean. It is very calm unlike the wild waves in Pinones, where most of the locals go to swim or in Rio Grande. The only good thing about the hotel is the beach. Otherwise, it is just ok. The lobby is small and not as grand as you would expect it to be. It feels cramped with its low ceilings. The hotel, El San Juan, next door has a lobby and shopping gallery, which makes it feel 5 times bigger than the IC. On Friday evening the IC was very dead compared to El San Juan as it has no disco and just a tame jazz band playing near the bar. The room itself looks very outdated and has very unappealing decor. Not tropical or even modern at all. Could have been any room at a 4 star hotel in Ohio. We did eat at one of the restaurants, Chris Ruth Steakhouse, which always has excellent service and steaks. This is the 2nd trip we have made to Puerto Rico and the 2nd time we ate there, and it has always been exemplary and each time we see Latino celebrities. This being our second trip, we decided instead of spending 5 days straight at Isla Verde like we did the first time that we would hotel hop. It is a great idea to rent a car and drive from place to place instead of being stuck at Isla Verde and taxiing into San Juan. There is not much to do or see if you walk around Isla Verde.

Growing up my family had an apartment in the ESJ towers and I have been to San Juan several times.

(Definitely worth it) The rooms were very nice and we did not hear any noise at all. The staff was very friendly and though we only ate lunch at the restaurant by the pool it was very good, yes it was expensive but you are paying for the convenience of sitting in your bathing suit and not having to leave the grounds. The only complaint I have and it wasn't even that bad was the pool could have been cleaner. I am not talking about leaves, etc., but the actual pool walls seemed dirty and it made the pool look murky. Not a big deal though. We had drinks and walked around El San Juan next door. Really fun on Saturday night. The lobby is beautiful, you could make a whole night out of relaxing by the bar and people watching. They have a live band and everyone dances. The prices are actually cheaper there than at the lobby bar at the IC. ($16 for a shot of Patrone) Starting that Friday there was a culinary food festival going on in Old San Juan. Perfect for us foodies! Instead of just going to one restaurant we got a chance to sample a few. They had tables set up all along Calle Fortalezza and several live bands. We had an appetizer of blackened seared tuna in a Thai peanut sauce at Tantra that was out of this world. We also ate at Dragonfly, Aquaviva, and the Parrot Club. The halibut at the Parrot club was excellent. We had planned and usually do go to more traditional restaurants while on vacation but ended up at these places and I am not complaining. It started off the first night when we ended up strolling into the water club near the IC and ate at Tangerine, One cevicehe appetizer later and we were hooked to the modern/fusion restaurants. We did go down the street from the IC to the Metropol for the black bean soup, it was yummy, just as I remembered. One more thing, the IC does hit you with a hefty occupancy tax/resort service charge, (about $66 a day on weekdays, $80 on weekends) I believe they tell you that when you actually book the room, I suppose I overlooked it and was a bit shocked upon checking out.

It was not the best trip we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken though we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve traveled to the Olympics this winter in Italy and with a far younger baby to Mexico and other parts of the US. So here are a few reasons why we would probably not recommend traveling to Puerto Rico. The Intercontinental Hotel itself is very nice. It has a beautiful lobby with marble floors, and dark wood accents. But the walls are EXTREMELY thin. The hotel was hosting various proms, Jr. proms and weddings during our stay and had many teenage guests. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get into their rooms at 3:00 or 4:00 am and have the parties continue in their rooms and all the while it seemed like someone had just stepped into our very own room. I could clearly hear their conversations, the steps they took across their room, and even what they were watching on TV. These events woke us up 3 out of the 5 nights we stayed. Also, the hotel is located in a tourist area with various other hotels, however once you walk across the street you feel like you are stepping into an impoverished urban area with drunk men and scantily clad women on the street. The food throughout Puerto Rico was very hit and miss. Yes, the hotel has three restaurants (none that we visited) but the day we did venture to get something to eat in their poolside restaurant we had an $85 tab for a very plain green salad and a sandwich. Far too expensive for what we actually received. I was much more satisfied when I walked across the street to get some far tastier Puerto Rican food for about $8 a dish. I recommend the Asopao de Pollo (Chicken Gumbo). My baby and husband really enjoyed that. All in all I think we received the best food and service on our second night there when we went to the shopping center across the street for some (of all things) Chinese food. We went sightseeing as part of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tours to the Bacardi Rum Distillery (you get two free drinks and a very well put together tour of the distillery and Bacardi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history), Camuy caves (interesting), the Arecibo Observatory, and to old San Juan. We also visited the Fort of San Cristobal and the El Moro Fort, on an alternate day when we decided to go back to Old San Juan on our own. Taxi fair to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Viejo San Juan\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was about $20 each way. One of our tour guides advised us to request a receipt from the taxis as a method of keeping them honest. We had several incidents that really tested our patience while on this trip. On one occasion I asked the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concierge to direct me to a restaurant where I could see the sunset but she thought I wanted to have dinner on the actual beach. After going back and forth with her about what I wanted she directed me to a restaurant down the street from the hotel that was nowhere near the beach and was completely empty when we showed up. We ended up walking to a restaurant that sat on the pier which had the worst food and service we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever received. It also seemed like I was at Spring Break central with loud reggaeton music and all the young people getting ready to start their partying.

We arrived in at the Intercontinental Saturday May 13th approx 2:30 P.M. , after a nice smooth filght. Check in was quick and staff very courtious. We left our luggage with them and went on our way, straight to the beach side grill. The food was good, but very expensive, $12.00 for a hot dog/fries and a hamburger was the same--just add $2.00 for a slice of cheese. The view is beautiful tropical folliage, white powdery sand, and aqua ocean on one side and a lush tropical landscaped grounds with pool/pool bar. Of course you always have to have that pina colada floating or sitting at the pool bar-I just love that whole idea! But again very expensive, $20.00 for two. Only and hour has pasted and we're going up to the room. The room is pretty large, well cleaned and maintained with a king size bed, stocked mini bar, dresser, and tv. Inbetween the main room and the bath room is a nice vanity area to put on make up. Then the bathroom, very clean, nice marble tile , full tub/shower (excelllent water pressure), a hair dryer, iron/board, and even a scale (not that I got on it) I'm on vacation. Our room over looked the front of the resort, that was kinda cool to watch the planes come in and see what was around the area. The bed was comfortable, we didn't mind the sounds out the planes taking off and the sound was muffeled with the sliding doors closed. We're used to noise at night living close to railroad tracks here at home. I only mention this because several reviews stated the the noise was unbarable at times--we didn't find that to be the case. For our 1st breakfast we just went down stairs --again, the food was good, but pricy ($44.00 for 2). Now that we know how expensive it is we went off the property for our meals. You are surrounded by all kinds or fast food (churches chicken, pizza hut, wendy's, taco bell, taco maker), etc. we found the Pondarosa to have a good breakfast--there is even an OutBack restaurant around the corner (definately somethng for everyone). We didn't take any tours, but rented a car (off property cheaper) and explored on our own. Map of island is easy to navigate, exits maked, highways are kinda rough. We went to the rain forest and spent the day (breath-taking) hard hiking if your not fit. Drove around to several beaches, I loved them all and none were over crowded. Took a ride to the caves--that was too cool, it's amazing to be so deep into the ground and stand inside this huge, cool, dark dome with enough light to see what's around, giant stalagtites and stalagmites protruding from the ground and ceiling of the cave. We saw some bats flying around one section and one right infront of me hanging upside down with one wing open . That is the coolest picture I took. We also went to the center of the island and visited with some of my husbands family--the ride was beautiful with water falls that you see after taking a hair pin turn traveling up the mountain. We're not much for night life so all we really did is go out for dinner and stop on the way back to the casino. I liked the one in the El San Juan better than the others and that was only because of the appearance--the others weren't very elabrate for being a casino, well not what I'm used to anyway.

I was worried about a difficult check-in, tiny rooms, thin walls, etc. I was pleased that everything in those areas turned out ok. Though our room was not ready upon arrival, it was not a problem because we were given a hospitality room to change. I was not feeling well from the flight, so they allowed us extra time in the room. The room was adequate in size... and was very very clean. We were on the 16th (top) floor, and the view was lovely. I didn't hear our neighbors, but did hear doors in the hall closing- not a big deal at all. In general, the accomodations were nice. Not spectacular, but certainly nice enough. The pool was lovely... but overcrowded with loud guests. We stayed on the beach most of the time, and heard \"boom boxes\" playing loudly. I think many of the island people vacation there for a night or two over the Memorial Day weekend. I felt as if it were more a spring break atmosphere... not what you'd expect for $300+ a night, and in May. Tuesday after Memorial Day was the best day. The beach was also nice. Definitely a people watching beach! Ocean water was nice as well. Not crystal clear, but still clean and warm. The conceirge was great- though they recommend you take the bus to Old San Juan for 75 cents as opposed to a taxi- $19 one way. DO NOT take the bus if you want to feel secure and comfortable. Very shady characters. My husband and I could not understand why the concierge would recommend doing so.

The room was nicely decorated, everything worked fine. It was nice to have a safe in the room. There's also a small fridge, and a market across the street. Two great breakfast places were across the street, by the market, Mi Casita, and the bakery. Mi Casita has $2.50 bfast special everyday. Subway and some other fast food restaurants are also across the street. The hotel food is way overpriced. Breakfast was like $14 min. We didn't eat at the hotel except for Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, which, of course, was the best steak ever. There's also a casino in the hotel, nickel slots are were it's at! I had a few good nights in \"Biddyville,\" as my husband called it. (There were lots of older women playing the nickel slots) The guy in the gift shop even went to another hotel to get my size in a shirt I wanted. Free towels and bottled water at the pool everyday. The pool needs a review all on its own. That was the most fabulous pool I have been to, and I've been to a lot. Rock formations, water falls, bridge, swim up bar, it is sooo nice! I do not recommend renting a car, unless you have terrific navagational skills. The streets seem very difficult to navigate. The taxi was well worth it. The bus was less expensive by far, but took like half an hour to wait on, then twice as long to get there as a taxi. This website helped me choose our vacation, so I hope my review has helped you.

I am starting a new job next week so I was really excited about getting in a (much deserved) vacation. I searched and searched for the perfect spot to go and wound up booking at the Intercontinental Resort and Casino. We had never been to PR so we had no idea what to expect. We arrived and took a quick $15 cab ride from the airport to the hotel, $15 for a 5 minute cab ride seemed excessive but what the heck...we were in Puerto Rico! We checked in and found our \"Garden View\" room overlooked the roof of the restuarant but beyond that was a beautiful blue ocean so I got over it. We headed down to lunch and found that the cheapest thing on the menu was a veggie wrap for $10. This was about the time we realized this was not going to be a cheap trip. I will spare you the play by play but the moral of this story is that Puerto Rico (the Intercontinental specifically) is very expensive. The Intercontinental is a nice hotel...I say nice, not great, and far from fabulous compared to several other Intercontinental's that I have stayed at in the past. It is far away from any other restaurants or shopping so if you want to get a meal outside of the hotel, get ready to pay AT LEAST $40 roundtrip to get anywhere else, same goes for shopping. The casino was okay, but very small and very smokey. The pool is very nice...this is where I spent the majority of my stay. The spa is nice but the doors to the rooms are very thin. Throughout my 55 minute massage I heard a little kid who had been dropped off in the reception area crying for her mother while she recieved a massage in the room next to me. I will close with the fact that the hotel was nice and the service was great but I would not reccomend this to anyone who plans to explore anything outside of the hotel. My reccomendation is to stay in the Old San Juan area. It is chock full of restuarants, bars, and shops (The Parrot Club is a must!). I was told that this was the \"ghetto\" area but quite honestly the whole of San Juan that I saw resembles the ghetto and Old Town was the most fun. P.S. If you are thinking of booking a trip to PR within the next month or two, talk to the tourism commission. The PR gov't is having a bit of a economic setback at the moment and all public employees (schools, hospitals, gov't agencies, etc.) are unemployeed due to the current elected party.

The rooms were very clean and we didn't have any problems checking in. The hotel is close to other hotels and shops, so dining was easy. The neighboring El San Juan Hotel has an amazing salsa club with live music on many nights. We stayed away from the casino because we're not gamblers and we've been to Vegas. We'd recommend skipping breakfast in the hotels and walking across the street to the mini-mall that has breakfast places (e.g., a bakery) for less than $5 per person. There's also a great homestyle Puerto Rican (Criollo) restaurant across the street-their asopao de pollo (chicken soup) was delicious and inexpensive. We'd recommend skipping the hotel restaurants unless you'd like to really pay a lot for a nice meal. Be forewarned, this hotel is not near Old San Juan--if you plan to go to Old San Juan, it's a pretty costly taxi ride ($20 one way).

We had a decent sized room (king bed, sofa) facing the ocean. It does make a big difference when you get that view and open your sliding door for a nice breeze off the ocean. The higher your floor the better the view. People have complained about the walls being very thin and hearing everybody else but honestly it depends who is staying next to you. It's pretty much luck of the draw. Tell the front desk if your neighbors are too loud. They'll handle it for you. The hotel is very very close to the airport so that's good but also bad in some respects. Only an $11 cab ride (5 min) away but you can hear the boom of the planes arriving and departing close by. Bewteen 11 pm and 7 am the airport has very minimal activity. The pool area is very spacious with plenty of comfy chairs to claim. The staff is very attentive and accommodating to help you enjoy your stay there. There are two bars/restaurants at the pool area, one closer to the beach and one has a swim up bar. The \"Splash\" swim up bar makes their drinks better than the Ciao restaurant. Definitely important when your paying $8 per drink plus tipping. Food at both places is your typical bar food. Pricier because of the convenience of eating right there at the poolside/beachsisde. You can walk right across the street to a few places for cheaper breakfast/lunch food (i.e. Subway). The beach outside the hotel is decent but the ocean water surprisingly has lots of seaweed. They have water activities such as jet skiing, parasailing, banana boat. Isla Verde beach area allows you to take nice walks up and down the coast. The hotel offers you chairs and umbrellas for the beach as a guest, free of charge, just throw a few $ tip to the guys busting their butts hauling them out for you. They have a decent gym overlooking the ocean close to the beach. It's included in your stay. The hotel has a few different restaurants- sushi, steak, italian, breakfast buffet. Did all of them except for the italian. Enjoyed all of them, little pricier but that's expected for hotel standards. The casino is pretty good, open every day from 10am-4am. Guy sells cigars in front of it during the evening. Little bar in the lobby area with salsa playing music in the evenings. If you plan on hanging in the lobby area during the evening bring a sweatshirt, it's cold in there! People actually hang out in there because it's nice.

Fortunately there was a walgreens right down the street and the problem was solved with a $1.25. If you are not a big breakfast eater, we highly recommend the bakery in the strip mall across the street. Great baked goods, ham egg & cheese sandwiches, and a mean cup of coffee. The owner is very nice and remembers how you like your coffee after one day. Another food tip...walk to the end of the beach (to the right) there is a little dive hotel (not the bar hanging over the edge) at the end. Walk through the motel and you will see an amazing view of the ocean, have a great burger, a cold beer, all for a few bucks. Great find! We loved Puerto Rico.

We don't cruise, so our experiences have not been limited to port areas or 1 night stays either. That being said, we are totally enchanted with the island of Puerto Rico! We just returned from our 5 night stay at the Intercontinental Hotel there and couldn't be happier with the service and accomodations received. I know the details below are long winded, feel free to skim, but I'd rather give too much info than too little. We are all unique and what means something to one doesn't always mean the same to others. Bottom line is, Puerto Rico and the Intercontinental are both tops in our book! Location - The hotel is a short $11US taxi ride from the airport. It is very close to the airport, but so are ALL the hotels in the Isle Verde/Carolina section. Airplane noise was noticable out by the pool during peak times, so keep that in mind if you are sensitive to it and maybe look for a hotel away from the airport. Definitely no fault of this hotel and to be honest, we didn't notice any airport noise from inside our room (facing the ocean, not the city). Pool - The pool is in a class by itself! The combination swim up/walk up bar is partially covered to provide shade most of the day for people who want to park there and drink without becoming a lobster. The pool bar has 3 tv's and plenty of name brand alcohol. Everything can be charged to your room, no need to bring cash to the pool area. There is also a small footbridge, several shallow ledges for in-pool suning, and (best of all) a multi-waterfall simulated rock formation with all kinds of places to sit/stand under them. A small section of the pool gets 6'+ deep and is clearly marked by bouy lines. The rest is generally between 3' and 5'+. Hot tub is huge and connected to the pool for easy in/out between the two. Plenty of areas to get shade and sun around the pool. Thick cushioned loungers with lots of tables and umbrellas are usually able to be had with not too much trouble. Towels are easy to get and plentiful as is all the FREE bottled water you can drink. Drink service was almost always at hand and not bothersome if you didn't want it. If you are a pool person, this is your place to be. Beach - Soft, beige sand is perfect for long, barefoot walks. Not too crowded. Surf is just rough enough to be interesting, perfect for the body surfer. Lots of watersports options nearby. Beaches are public but not overrun by pushy vendors (we saw very few at all). Only knock was the above average amount of seaweed in the first 10-15 yards of surf. Most hotels on the beach issue their guests daily ID braclets to get back in. Room - The shower is the best we have ever, and I mean EVER, had! It is what all showers in the world should be designed after! Holds the temperature, gets as hot as you want (or not), easy to operate and the water pressure is like a small fire hose. Did I mention we liked the shower? A small refrigerator is in the room stocked with a couple beers, a couple waters, some soda... any of which will be charged to your room if consumed. The great part about it is there are no sensors inside, so you can move things around and use the ample extra space for your own perishables. The king bed was very comfortable, pillows were just OK, plenty of blankets if you want them. Enough drawer and closet space for 2 people on an average stay. Large desk and sofa in the sitting area. Balcony was too small, but better than none at all. Sliding glass door lets the Caribbean air wash right into the room. A/C works really, really well (too well sometimes) and sound is on the level of white noise. TV gets several popular US & PR channels. Iron & ironing board. In-room safe with self-program code and lots of room inside. Plenty of mirrors and lights around them to see what you're doing. Like most hotels, you can probably hear through the walls if you really try (like say putting your ear up to it), but just sitting in the room we heard nothing on either side of us. One big problem we had was being right outside the elevator and several exuberant guests seemed to think nothing of shouting down halls and slamming doors at all hours. No matter where you are, please remember if you're in the hallway everyone can hear you. Food - Pool & beach bars offered some great lunch type food which ranged from the native (Puerto Rican specialties) to the ordinary (Burgers & Pizza). All were very good with no lingering effects. La Terraza was also very good. Room service at breakfast was prompt, accurate and the food was delcious. We did not try the other restaurants at the hotel since there were so many other options on Isle Verde and Old San Juan. One night we ate at Metropol with mixed results. My pork was way too fatty, but her beef dish was very good. Our best food experience was at Dragonfly in Old San Juan. Simply to die for. Slightly larger than Tapas style portions designed to mix and share. Get the mongolian beef, it's sublime! Parrot Club was great too. El San Juan hotel next door has several restaurants of which we tried two. The Italian one (next to Palms) was excellent. The Mexican one... wasn't. But I digress, back to the hotel. Casino/Lobby Bar - Casino is a decent size, never really too crowded. The one and only $5 min Blackjack table fills up quickly at night with the $10 min table right behind it. Minimums don't change with the time of day. There is a dress code after 6, somewhat enforced. Slots range from 1 cent to $25, most are 5 cents. One Roulette wheel, a couple craps tables (usually only 1 going), a few poker tables and some other misc tables (let it ride, caribbean stud, etc.). Drink service at at the casino was spotty. My advice is have a back up plan for entertainment because the house seemed to have some uncanny streaks of good luck. The lobby bar seemed quite nice to lightly mix and mingle or listen to some music, but to \"see and be seen\" the place to go seemed to be next door at El San Juan. Spa - I had a Swedish massage, 55 min for $85 plus gratuity. Nice clean facilities and the staff are very friendly. As for the massage, I've had better and I've had worse. Sorry I can't be of more help than that. Service - Exceptional. Upgraded at check in. Housekeeping did a great job throughout the stay (1 day it could have been a little quicker). The lobby was always full of hotel personnel ready to answer any questions. There was an \"Instant Service\" button on the room phone which immediately connected to someone who greated us by name and addressed any issues we had immediately, then followed up to ensure we were satisfied. Tour desk people were extremely helpful and the tour guides we had were simply the best. The service at this hotel was among the best of any we've stayed at in the Caribbean. No surprises at check out either. Misc Stuff - You can do as little or as much as you like at this hotel and in Puerto Rico in general. We took the rainforest tour with Castillo Tours, ask for Conzavos (a.k.a. Papa Lion), the 2nd best tour guide in Puerto Rico (he'll explain why). We also did the Old San Juan & Bacardi Rum tour with Antonio who went above and beyond to help us.

It's one of the nicest we've ever stayed at. However, I want to emphasize the benefit of staying on the ocean front side. We stayed on both (ocean and city) and found the experiences to be like night and day! Facing the ocean you feel like you are on a Caribbean island. You have a beautiful view (the higher the better) of the ocean and pool. It's great having the sliding glass doors open and getting the ocean sound and breeze. Across the hall, you feel like you are at an airport hotel. It is loud from the airport and city noises and you don't want the curtains open. The pool was terriffic with waterfalls and a swim up bar. The beach was very nice. The staff was exceptionally pleasant; from the pool attendants to the waiters and especially the front desk staff. The Japanesse restaurant was one of the best we've ever dined at. Much better than the one at the El San Juan. The food at the pool was great, but huge portions. We learned to order 2 meals for 4 people. The restaurant on the beach is nice, but allow plenty of time to wait. They have a small pizza oven and many orders. The Ranch restaurant at the El San Juan was fun for kids and had great atmosphere. Renting a car was easy - right in the hotel. Maria and Hector (Avis desk) were very helpful. Loved the Rain Forest.

Some info/impressions, in no particular order: -- Great pool. Really great pool. Waterfalls, a little footbridge to swim under, beautifully landscaped, great upkeep. --The lounges around the pool go early. I got out there by 8 to secure 3 in the shade. But.... --The chaises by the beach (which the staff will set up for you) seem to be available all day. I've heard that you have to get there early-ish for an umbrella, though. --The beach is really nice -- nice for long walks, really good for sand castle building. The water was warmer than the pool! Some seaweed, but there was only one day when it was TOO much seaweed. Soft sand; no water shoes needed. --On the beach, walk to the right (toward the El San Juan) for boating activities. My kids and husband went parasailing (they were each harnessed in with him, so he went up twice) and that was a definite highlight of the week for them. Costs about $60 each. The banana boat ride was more.....um....exciting than we thought it would be, judging from how it looks from the shore. Don't bring your glasses or camera, because you WILL be tossed off the boat at some point. You'll either think that's fun, or not. One of my daughters loved it; the other sobbed. --Unbelievably great, friendly service. Without exception. The concierge service is particularly wonderful, particularly Nestor. --One complaint: The walls of the room are thin. This is no problem unless you have really loud neighbors. There was only one point during the week when we were bothered, when our neighbor started blasting loud rap at 5:30 a.m. I called downstairs, and security came right up and knocked on their door (and knocked and knocked, until they finally turned off the music....but then we could hear what the music was drowning out: \"Oh baby.....OH BABY BABY! OH OH OH!\"). --We had a \"garden/pool view\" room, which was facing the ocean...in fact, we could see the ocean just fine! All this means is that it's on a lower floor (we were on 6). So I wouldn't pay extra for ocean view, unless you spend lots of time on the balcony. (The balconies are small -- just one chair and a small table.) -- Food: We had two TERRIFIC meals at Ruth Chris's steakhouse, and a really nice meal at Passagio, the italian place. (That has a dress code: no flip flops or shorts.) Nice breakfast each day at the buffet. Dinner one night at the restaurant down on the beach (Ciao Mediterranean--get the pizza!). -- We had dinner one night at Metropol, which is within walking distance, and has nice authentic local food. Fun place. Had dinner one night at Tequila Grill, which is on the 10th floor of El San Juan (rude hostess--that's the only rudeness I encountered all week). Great view, okay Mexican food. There's also a place called The Ranch on that floor. Both casual. --El Morro is a wonderful trip. --Old San Juan: I had a great time wandering around on my own. If you're not going to do a tour, have the cabbie drop you at El Convento hotel, wander up and down that hill (has outlet stores, if you're into that, but also nice historical things: San Juan Cathedral, San Juan Gate one block west (? toward the water)), then walk down to San Francisco or the street directly after that (LaFortenza, or something) and turn left for some nice local shops. Got some very nice stuff at Puerto Rico Arts and Crafts, which is on LaFortenza (or whatever). I ran into a funeral procession, complete with singing and drums, and masked dancers.

We travel often, have visited many Caribbean islands, and truly enjoyed our experience. The Intercontinental is an excellent choice, location is great, facilities are very good, and the staff and service is high quality. We really enjoyed the pool area. A big plus are the very cushy and comfortable beach loungers, of \"Ritz\" quality, and the unlimited spa-thick beach towels. We never had a problem finding three chairs together, and the staff comes around on a regular basis to take food and drink orders. Excellent pool experience all around. The food at the beach/pool restaurant is very good, and we ate lunch there often. Drinks were also great, and prices were what any regular traveler would assume to spend. The IC is very close to the airport so you will hear loud plane noise occasionally, (not at night). It was actually great being so close, as we gained almost two extra vacation days since it only takes 5 minutes to get to the airport. Old San Juan is also very close, about 15 minutes by cab (note, it's almost an HOUR by bus! Avoid the bus unless you want to experience a cramped, bumpy ride. True, it only costs 75 cents, but I would never do it again). The old town is very quaint and has many scenic vistas. I loved taking in the Spanish influenced architecture, walking the hilly streets, and taking photos. Traveling with two other women, we also felt very safe. I went into Old San Juan one day by myself and I was perfectly fine. The town is very small and walkable. While in Old San Juan, the El Convento Hotel is a nice place for a Tapas lunch. We also highly recommend the restaurant Baru, located on St. Sebastian Street, for dinner. Nestor, the concierge at IC, is very helpful and recommended Baru. It's worth the trip. We considered staying at The Ritz, but were happy with our decision on the IC. The IC is in a slightly better location, less \"stuffy\", and has a bit more going on. Right next door is the El San Juan Hotel (with the big \"ESJ\" on the side), which offers more night life and action than the IC, but the entire lobby/restaurant/first floor mall area is enclosed with no windows, and reeks of smoke. It reminded me of a bad Las Vegas resort. The IC had live music every night at the small lobby bar, and sometimes another band inside the casino. The rooms are nicely appointed, kept very clean, and everything was quite new and modern. The only issue I had was with the noise level; I am a very light sleeper, and my room had an adjoining door that was not sound-proofed. The next room had a crying baby.

We go to San Juan 2-3 times per year and usually stay at the Marriott Resort in the Condado. We wanted to try the Isla Verde area for something different this trip. So, much of this review will be comparing this resort to the Marriott. First off, if you are new to Puerto Rico, you have to understand that an \"upscale\" hotel there will not be as nice as what you'll find in the States. They are made of concrete, so there's more noise. The furnishings are not as nice. Rooms are often musty due to being seaside. The staff is on an \"island\" schedule, so you have to be patient. Second, I have to commend the professionalism of the staff at the Intercontinental....better than any other place we've stayed. In a nutshell, this hotel would be good if it were less expensive. It is in many respects very similar to the Marriott Condado, just more pricey. The rooms are similar, but noisier (doors slam more loudly and the airplanes fly much closer to it with the airport nearby). The rooms were like an Omni, a Courtyard or Marriott in the States....not elegant by any stretch. The casino is okay, but no better than Marriott's and not as nice as the El San Juan nearby or El Convento in Old San Juan. The neighborhood is certainly not one where you want to walk after dark. There are grocery stores and fast food places nearby for during the daytime. No boutiques, cafes or nicer souvenir places like in the Condado. The gym is so-so, as most are down there. The pool area can't compare with Marriott's or with others I've seen. The stretch of beach it's on was quite dirty, partly due to wintertime when winds stir up more seaweed. However, it was nice to be able to jog on the beach for 1.5 or 2 miles thru Isla Verde....in front of all the hotels, etc. Fun to \"people watch\" there, too.

From the second we arrived, we were treated like royalty. The entire staff (valet parking drivers, doormen, bellman, and even housekeeping) were unbelievably friendly and helpful. Speaking of valet parking, if you do rent a car (and I suggest you do), I highly suggest you \"invest\" in valet parking (unless you plan on checking in to the hotel and not leaving). At $20 per night it is only $6 more than the ($14) self-parking and about 10 times more convenient. Especially when it is raining. The self-parking is not only across the (busy) street, but getting out of the self-parking lot was reported to be total chaos. Two people we spoke with said they moved their car to valet parking because each time they wanted to use their car, it was a 25-minute process of getting to their car, followed by sitting in exit line (to pay the cashier). With valet parking, you can call down from your room and your car will be waiting for you by the time you step off the elevator. Unlike the self-parking lot, the hotel was anything but chaos. It was well run and the entire week we were there, I swear that I did not open a single door or push a single elevator button (other than on my actual hotel room floor). There were bellmen, hotel security, and guest service people (most dressed in suits) everywhere. Not \"everywhere\" in a bad way, but in the \"if you ever need anything, someone will be right there\" sort of way. I've stayed at some very nice hotels before and while the InterContinental isn't exactly a Ritz-Carlton, you wouldn't have known because the level of service was excellent. Anyhow, when we checked in, I was told that there were no non-smoking rooms available in the class of room we booked (\"City View Room\") and that the hotel staff had automatically upgraded us to an \"Ocean View Room\", the next class up. Normally, when I'm told, \"We don't have any non-smoking rooms\", I have to ask for an upgrade, but the InterContinental staff didn't even give me the chance to ask, they fixed the problem before I arrived. While the rooms were not the largest I'd ever seen at an InterContinental, they were very nice. Everything looked new and was in good condition. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spotless. We spent very little time in the room (which is why I had originally booked the slightly less expensive \"City View Room\"), though I must admit that the view of the ocean was a nice perk. Would I have paid the extra $50 to $100 per night for this view? Probably not. The grounds of the hotel were fabulous. The pool area was great, food and drinks were always available, and we met some cool people. The beach itself is on public property (just a few steps beyond the pool area), but you would have thought it was a private beach based on the level of service (food, drinks, chairs, towels, etc.) When you pick up your pool (beach) towel, you're given an arm band (so they can identify you as a hotel guest). All you need to do is show the \"beach chair guy\" your arm band and he'll bring a pool (beach) chair to any part of the beach you want. Usually standing next to the \"chair guy\" is the \"security guy\", his job twofold: (1) Make sure that non-guests don't get on hotel property and (2) ensure that hotel guests aren't bothered by vendors on the beach. Some others on TripAdvisor site have said beach vendors were a major problem, but the entire week we were there, we only saw about 5 people trying to sell things, and each time the \"security guy\" made sure they weren't bothering guests. Truth be told, 3 of the 5 vendors simply set up a little kiosks, and didn't bother anyone. The other two were kindly redirected to other parts of the beach by the hotel staff. Just because it is a public beach doesn't mean you can annoy people, right? The beach itself was nice. The water was warm and the sand was soft. If there was any complaint I had, it was the huge amounts of seaweed, both on the shore and in the surf. Some days the seaweed was heavy, other days it was nonexistent. You really can't blame the hotel for this; it was Mother Nature. But the beach (seaweed and trash) was thoroughly cleaned every morning (which explained the numerous tire tracks on the beach). Speaking of stuff on the beach, there was a little restaurant and bar (Ciao Mediterranean Caf\u00c3\u00a9) that sat on the edge of the hotel property (so both people at the pool and beach could get food and drinks). The food quality was reasonable (remember, this is bar food) but a little on the expensive side considering the very small portions. Other than the occasional drink or snack from beach caf\u00c3\u00a9, we did not really dine at the hotel. For one, the prices were quite high (a simple breakfast for two, with coffee and orange juice was over $30). And more importantly, there were so many good restaurants in the area that we had to go out and sample the local flavor. As far as I'm concerned, hotel food is hotel food, no matter how you look at it. So we chose to dine out. This is where a car becomes quite important. With a car, Old San Juan is only 15 minutes away. A small price to pay for the charm (and food) found there. Here are a few of the places we liked in and around the area: * Ambrosia Restaurant, 250 Calle Cristo, San Juan, PR 00901. * Chef Pillai Tantra, 356 Calle Fortaleza, San Juan, PR 00901 * Che's, 35 Calle Caoba, San Juan, PR 00913 (5-minutes from InterContinental). * La Terraza, Marginal C-1, Dorado, PR 00646 (Not to be confused with the InterContinental lobby restaurant of the same name). * Mojito's, 323 Recinto Sur, San Juan, PR 00901 While we did spend much of our time relaxing at the hotel's beach and pool, we used the car at least twice a day for sightseeing, finding cool places for lunch or dinner, and rum runs to the grocery store. We frequented the hotel bar numerous times (live music, people watching, etc.) it did get expensive. For the cost of 2 drinks in the hotel bar, you can buy a 1-liter bottle of rum and a 2-liter bottle of Coke. The supermarket (Supermercados Grande) is less than 1-mile from the hotel. While some of the supermarket staff didn't speak English (thought most people in Puerto Rico do), about 90% of the products do. Having had to grocery shop in foreign counties (like Korea), it is always nice to be able to recognize what your buying. Ditto with the nearby Walgreens, which carried a multitude of sunscreen and bug spray (both of which you'll need). In the end, we very much enjoyed the InterContinental. Truth be told, between Old San Juan and the area near the InterContinental (Isla Verde), you've got everything you need for a good vacation. We did manage to explore other parts of the island (Arecibo, the Bacardi distillery, Dorado, Ponce, and some other areas) but did not find them as interesting. However, it was nice to explore the island and see the people, places, and things that made up the rest of Puerto Rico. If I had anything to grumble about, it would be the relatively high cost of the hotel room (and even higher costs of the food there [which we ate little of]). I would not say it was astronomical, just expensive. And while there is no sales tax in Puerto Rico, there is a 10% hotel tax (20% if it is a resort, like the InterContinental). So for every $1,000 you spend, you'll have to cough up an extra $200 in taxes. Ouch. Add to that $20 a day for valet parking and $10 per drink, and it can start adding up. However, we did have a great time on our trip, and the quality of the InterContinental contributed greatly to our level of comfort and satisfaction. In the end, if given the chance to repeat my stay, I would definitely do so.", "Date": "January 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Anniversary Trip\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4355229", "Content": "My darling husband and I have been looking forward to our 30th wedding anniversary and celebrating with a special trip just to relax in the sun because the anniversary is on January 10th. After much research and looking at all possibilities I decided on the Intercontinental Hotel in San Juan. Hawaii was too expensive for us this year and we were not interested in a long flight. Darling husband was not into a cruise, it's been a busy year and we both just wanted to veg. The Intercontinental is everything we expected and more. The property is beautiful and kept meticulously clean. The pool area is as wonderful as everyone else has been saying on this site and I lived out there all week. The beach is ok but there were little \"noseeums\" biting me out there so I was very happy to enjoy the pool area. Also, the water had a lot of seaweed washing up. Husband was happy as long as his drink was cold! We stayed the entire week on priority club points and they upgraded our room after the first night and the view was amazing. We felt like we were sitting in the top of the palm trees with a view of the ocean. I went shopping in Old San Juan and really enjoyed browsing there. The Coach and Dooney and Burke outlets have great prices. Ruth's Chris was excellent as always and we went twice, Passiagio's was ok - mediocre - we went twice also. The ElSanJuan next door is incredible and we had dinner at The Palm for our anniversary and were treated very special. The \"club\" concierge had Champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us in our room when we arrived as a surprise because it was our anniversary. This hotel has fabulous service, couldn't be nicer or more helpful. We have traveled a lot and stayed at Ritz Carlton and many Marriott Renaissance Hotels but this was probably the best service even than the cruise ships. The staff at this hotel will help you with anything and do it with a smile, they are always asking if everything is ok. We won a few dollars in the casino although it's annoying how long it takes to get paid when you win. My only criticism of this hotel is that they need to upgrade the bed linens and the beds. We slept fine but after the Ritz Carlton and Marriott Renaissance and even Crowne Plaza, I expected the linens to be a little nicer but this is a small complaint, our room was great.

I was curious as to what my trip was going to be like since me & my bf were so young (we are 20) but we had a fantastic time! For young people isla verde is a great place to go to relax, chill by the beach and pool, and have fun. The drinking age in PR is 18 and alcohol is in no short supply although it can be expensive through the hotel. The Good It's a beautiful hotel with nice green plant life and a nice lobby & outside. immediately getting out of the cab we were greeted and helped by the staff outside and it was like that the whole vacation. The hotel staff was amazing in service and hospitality. They always held the door when we were walking in and out of the hotel and always greeted us and chatted with us when we saw them around the hotel. The pool was very nice and large. It has two small waterfalls and a lil cove in the middle of the two that you can sit in. Theres a swim up bar and a nice sized hot tub that was great to relax in. Security was pretty tight with the pool. You have to get a new colored wrist band everyday to get towels and complimentary water bottles. I guess because we were young we got checked a lot by security to make sure we were guests but it wasnt that bad. They dont want anyone sneaking into the pool. I also got ID'ed a few times at the casino and they are strict with not allowing any kids in there. Theres also shady canopies and umbrellas if ur not a big fan of the sun. there was no short supply of pool chairs. The beach was enjoyable and the hotel provided each guest with chairs brought to the location of your choice. The rooms were medium sized but cozy. At night in the lounge they have singers that sing different spanish music and some people get up and dance making a really nice atmosphere. the food in momoyama was awesome. the hot tub was open till 10pm for a nice late nite dip. There is a game room with a few decent games for the kiddies. The beach was amazing at sunset and at night. The water was warm and the sand was white & nice. Overall the stay was great and the food was good! The Bad The maids were not the best. The pool was beautiful - but FREEZING. everyone had trouble getting in it. I'm usually a big pool person but I couldn't bring myself to go in more than one time. The beach was warmer than the pool. The beach was nice, one of the nicest in the metro area but during christmas time the ocean cleans itself which means loads and loads of sea weed. The beach was covered with sea weed making it really hard to jump in. Once you got past a certain point it wasn't as bad but it was pretty gross. However, it does go away (the sea weed was completely gone on our last day). We asked the staff to recommend better beaches and we got a bunch of great beaches to visit. The one we went to was escambrones (its on the map given at the hotel). It was gorgeous and the water was clear & you could walk out 15 ft and still stand. I'd definitely reccomend it. The airport was also annoying and you heard every airplane that landed but you heard it practically everywhere on isla verde practically. The gift shop in the hotel was very overpriced & the tour desk was very sloppy. I reserved the biobay with castillo tours before I got there and when i confirmed they had no idea what I was talking about. I'd recommend going through Nestor at the concierge. Also the biobay tour we went on was in the van of some guy named Ishmael and it was horrible. I think tours through actual companys are better but i dont know who or why castillo tours put us with this guy. Avoid Ishmael. Last but not least do NOT rely on cabs. The taxi situation is ridiculous there. Its 20 USD one way to go into old san juan. We had no car which made it difficult to go out at times. The better clubs and food was in old san juan but we couldnt enjoy it as much because it was so pricey to get there. There is a bus thats only 75 cents but it took really long and I didn't feel that comfortable. If you speak spanish and dont mind locals the bus might be a good solution. The area around the hotel isnt the greatest but I wouldn't call it seedy. Take the bus and your definition of seedy might change. im from a city so I felt fine walking along the street but I wouldnt stray too far from the hotel. Food I thought the restaurants in the hotel were over priced so we went out searching for cheaper, local food. We ate a lot at Mi Casita in the shopping center across the street. They have good mofongos if ur into that. the food was good but the service was bad. We also ate at Metropol down the street. they had the best vanilla flan I have tasted in a long time. Once again the service wasnt great but food was very good. Across the street from Metropol is the isla verde mall that has a dennys if you want a cheap breakfast rather than the expensive breakfast in the hotel. There is a Walgreens if you walk in the san juan direction along with Burger King, Wendys, Churchs, Pizza Hut, Dominos, Subway & other little restaurants. In San Juan we loved Barra China. the service & food were great (their pina coladas were amazing). We ate at Ostra Cosa as well but we didnt enjoy it. If you are walking and you see a guy pushing a cart get some coco or another flavor. its only a dollar and they are very yummy. If you ask the hotel staff they will recommend good food for whatever you are looking for. There are definitely ways to eat good food for less if you are on a budget and know what you are doing. Overall for the price i thought Isla verde & the Intercontinental were great. its not a 5 star hotel but then again you arent really paying 5 star prices. if you want that pay a lot more and go to el san juan hotel. We had a great time and cant wait to go back! You will have an amazing time if you go knowing what you are in for. enjoy!

I was a little concerned about what I would find based on some of the previous reviews, but overall ended up quite satisfied. We had an ocean side \"deluxe\" room (#710), which had a great view and was relatively quiet (didn't hear our neighbors plus we made sure to get a room away from the elevators). In terms of the room, this is NOT a 5-star hotel - it's a solid 3.5 in my book, but I came in with this expectation and was not disappointed. Beds were fine, basic amenities fine, bathroom small but functional. If you're looking for a 4 or 5-star type experience, you'd have to look elsewhere (Ritz or El San Juan?). Otherwise, the pool area is really nice, the lobby is good, and the staff are friendly and helpful. We've gone to Florida the last 3 Christmases and got fed up with the spotty weather. So we decided to pay the extra price for better weather and were glad we did. Otherwise, in terms of room, beach and pool, this is not much different from the place we last stayed at in Boca Raton (I can't remember the name!) and the clientele is very similar. The beach is nice but not spectacular, but perhaps I'm a bit of a beach snob, having been to some of the best in the Carribean. For GREAT beaches in Puerto Rico, you have to take a short boat trip to one of the islands (Icacos or Culebra) off the East coast. In fact, I would highly recommend the East Wind catamaran sailing & snorkeling trip, although there aren't many comfortable or shaded seats on board, so be prepared to rough it a little and bring lots of sun protection. I grew up in cities and some rough areas, so had no problems wandering around at night, but the fact of the matter is that - outside the nice resorts - the Isla Verda area (and greater San Juan as far as I could tell) is very run-down and seedy. I knew this coming in and it didn't bother me, but for those of you who like to wander around discovering charming little shops and restaurants, you'll be disappointed! Perhaps Old San Juan is better for this, but my wife came away unimpressed from her half-day trip there (I didn't go). I would consider going back because: 1) the trip in and out is so easy, 2) the hotel, pool & beach are pretty nice, 3) the weather is better than Florida, and 4) some great beaches and snorkeling are an easy day-trip away.", "Date": "January 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York New York", "Title": "\u201cElegant and Relaxing\u201d", "Author": "tmsweet772", "ReviewID": "UR4312562", "Content": "Things I loved: pool, lobby, nice and attractive staff, beach, atmosphere Things I didn't like: Small gift shop, breakfast If you are looking for a hotel that has a beautiful lobby, gorgeous pool(s) and breathtaking beach this is the hotel for you.

Most times when leaving and entering the hotel, someone was always quick to hold the door open for you. The pool, beach and ocean were just delightful. There were plenty of chairs and the kids just loved the waterfalls in the pool area.

When people talk about the surrounding area/streets as being seedy/dumpy they are right on the money. What a shame to have such beautiful beachfront hotels surrounded by such unsavory characters and trash. Let's get Trump or Wynn down here and do it right. The hotels advertise casino gaming. I guess if you've never seen Vegas or AC these pocket casino's might work. The slot machines did not pay at all in the whole time I was there, not that I was looking to hit it big, but at least give you a little tickle once in a while. If your looking to get a free drink when your on the slots, think again, because it just does not happen. I spent about $500 over a few nights on the slots, and was never offered a drink. Another reason to bring in the Donald. Side trips to Old San Juan, Rain Forest and the Caves are a must if you have the time. Don't be fooled into going over to Ponce, nothing there to speak of.

I chose this hotel partly because of the reviews on this site. Unfortuneatly, my experience at the hotel was not a very good one. My biggest problem with the property was that it is rated 5 stars, and is no way even close. I would rate it 3 stars, at best. When you book a 5 star hotel you have certain expectations. None of my expectations were met.First of all, the Intercontinental is the old Sands Hotel. In places it looks just as dated as the Sands. The rooms have been renovated and were relatively clean but not like other Intercontinental Hotels, they have no style or warmth. We had booked a Jr. Suite. When we arrived we found out at the front desk that all Jr. Suites only face the city,(which really was not a problem) and all of them are located between the elevators. It was nosy all the time, but not unbearble. The room was not at all decorated, it had the necessaities but nothing else. Housekeepping was horrible. Everyday they never left toiletries, so no matter what time we got back to our room we had to call for toiletries. After 6 days, that gets old. They never made the king size bed, they put the bedspread on top of the TV and left it there. When we checked into the room there were no bathrobes, the toliet paper holder was off the wall, so the tissue sat on the floor and the hair blower was broken. I realize this may not seem like a big deal but when you want the service of a 5 star hotel, and pay for it, it is really dissappointing when you do not receive it. Management is a joke. When I went to check out my bill indicated that I had not paid anything and that was incorrect because I had pre-paid. In addition, the nightly rate was 40.00 more per night that I was quotad and paid for. When I questioned the front desk, they told me the 40.00 extra per night was for the third person in my room. I had no idea there was a fee, my reservation was always for three people and they never mentioned it. Plus no one ever did anything for the third person. My husband and I had to make up the sofa bed every night ourselves. As far as the prepayment, he told me according to him there was no prepayment. When I asked him to try and look deeper into the reservation he told me to call my credit card company and check my charges. By the way none of his responses were given in a pleasant way. At this point I wanted to speak to the manager.I called and received someone at the front desk who claimed he was the front desk manager.I wanted the hotel manager. I was told there was no hotel manager on staff this particular night. I know that was a lie because while I was waiting for the elevator approx. 20 minutes prior, I saw the hotel manager with another guest who was furious. I will not go into that problem because I did not witness it. Anyway, I knew the hotel manager was somewhere in the hotel but I decided to respect what this person told me and proceeded to tell him the problems with my bill. He tells me that he needs to look at all the records and he will call me back.....I am still waiting to hear from him and I have been home two days already. In fairness to the hotel, the food was very good, the grounds are well kept and very pretty, and they have a good beach. Service was good and the staff, (most of them) were friendly. The only problem was that they were always nice and pleasant, they just didn't always do what you asked for. I have been to San Juan many times and I think if you really want the service of a 5 star hotel maybe you should consider the Ritz Carlton. I have not stayed there so I cannot say so for certain.

I have to start this review off with a brief moan about first impressions of Puerto Rico. We had quite a bit of luggage due to our wedding and being on holiday for nearly four weeks. At the airport we paid for a luggage cart (surely all airports should provide this as a matter of courtesy?!?) only to find out that we were only allowed to wheel it to the other side of security and not outside to ground transportation - fat lot of help the luggage cart turned out to be. Airport staff were also really miserable (with the exception of the slightly mad immigration officer!). Anyway moan over ... my first impressions of the IC weren't overly positive. Whilst the staff were very welcoming and friendly I felt the room was a little small (King Bed Ocean View) and the view of the ocean can only be described as laughable given that the predominant view was of the roof of the restaurant below!!!! Other reviewers are spot on when they say that the balcony is very small - ours had a small table and one chair - not ideal for honeymooners wanting to share a romantic moment! The room was smaller than other hotels we've stayed in although I did like the separate dressing table area just outside the bathroom. Bathroom light fittings were damaged and the bathroom was very small. On the plus side the bed was very comfortable! We set off to explore the rest of the hotel. The pool is nice (the water is cold!) and there are plenty of sun loungers with very comfy cushions. The only negative thing about the pool area, in my opinion, is that it gets quite shady early on in the afternoon so not good for sunbathing. We had lunch at the restaurant at the cafe at the back - standard fare (pizza and burgers) but tasty with good service. The beach is nice and IC guests also have use of sun loungers. Ocean is warmer than the pool but beware my husband was stung by a jelly fish! The staff at the hotel were able to offer assistance with this to ease the stinging!!! We used valet parking whilst we were there and the car was always available when we got outside - valets were friendly and helpful. We ate at Ruth Chris Steakhouse (twice) - delicious! We also visited Old San Juan - there's parking right at the top by El Morro in an underground lot (v.convenient) and the Barcardi Factory. I agree with a previous review that you don't actually learn much about the process of rum making and the guided tours are herded through quite quickly not giving enough time to listen (it's an audio tour) to all the information. My husband enjoyed it as he had his two free drinks as well as mine!!! One evening we wandered over to El San Juan - hotel was busy and there seemed to be a good atmosphere. Not sure I would pay the price to stay here when it's only a five minute stroll from the IC and you can still enjoy all it has to offer. All in all I'm not sure I would hurry back to Puerto Rico even though I did enjoy my stay.", "Date": "November 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northeast USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat service and prime location\u201d", "Author": "blossom1022", "ReviewID": "UR4144870", "Content": "My husband and I (ages 34 and 32) just returned from a 5 night stay at the InterContinental. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been on many tropical vacations before (Mexico, Aruba, Jamaica, St. Marten). Our trip to P.R. was a last-minute decision. We were looking to travel to a beach destination during the Thanksgiving week that was a short flight from the N.Y. area airports. We wanted a location that had a beach, nightlife & an area we could explore independently. SUMMARY: Overall we were satisfied with our stay at the IC and I would rate it 3 out of 5 stars. ROOM: We booked and received a city-view room with a king size bed. The room was clean and functional, albeit smaller than I thought for the price and the carpet slightly worn. SERVICE: This is where the IC shines. Every employee we encountered was super friendly, attentive & eager to help. CONCIERGE and FRONT DESK: While friendly, I must note that some of the advice/suggestions given by the concierges were off the mark. For example: 2 of them recommended a trendy restaurant in Old San Juan, AquaViva. We asked for an upscale seafood restaurant. Well AquaViva is really a 2-star restaurant charging 5-star prices in my opinion. We found it to be overpriced, overhyped and overcooked (my dinner that is). The total bill was over $120 for 2, which included 2 drinks, appetizers & dinner for 2 people. Add on about $40 for the cab ride from the hotel and back, and we spent over $140. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind spending the $$ but when the place looks like a diner painted blue with seashells as the d\u00c3\u00a9cor and we arrive dressed to impress it was disappointing, especially since the food was overcooked and the bill was about the same as we spent at some much higher-end restaurants we dined at during our stay. We did enjoy La Piccola at the El San Juan & Ruth's Chris steakhouse. We chalked it up as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lost in Translation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd episode. What we consider upscale may differ from others since we eat out regularly at some great New York City restaurants. For those looking for restaurant suggestions in Old San Juan, I highly recommend simply taking a cab to Fortaleza street (restaurant row) and walking around yourselves and deciding. We saw more appealings choices when we went on our own strolling through Old San Juan. Also, on a number of occasions, we had difficulty speaking with the concierge or someone at the front desk. Either there was no one manned at the desk for extended periods of time, or a few times when I called the concierge desk no one answered the phone. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything to ruin our trip, but these are issues that keep the IC firmly as a 3-star hotel in my opinion. POOL/BEACH area: Everything was well maintained. Food and service at the restaurants near the pool and beach were great. Also, the hotel does provide free towels & beach chairs. You simply go to the pool hut and provide your room number. ACTIVITIES: We rented a car for a day with AVIS and went to Old San Juan and we also hopped on the ferry to go to the Bacardi Factory. The ferry to the Bacardi Factory was only 50 cents pp and then a quick shuttle ride to the Bacardi Factory. Personally, I would just skip the factory visit, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more like a looong Bacardi commercial. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really go into depth with the process of rum making. We were just glad that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay the tour package price to go there!! We also visited the bio-bay arranged right at the hotel for $150. This was a surreal experience. Make sure you wear your bathing suit and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wear anything that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to get wet. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re basically paddling your way in water in a kayak at 10 pm in pitch black so be prepared. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not for the faint of heart or for small children in my opinion. THANKSGIVING: The hotel had a special Thanksgiving buffet for about $35pp which included mimosas and dessert. Given the price, we thought it was a good value and the turkey was delicious. We noticed the resort had a lot more guests check in the day before Thanksgiving and we were glad we were leaving the next day to avoid the crowds. Would we go back? Possibly, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be more likely to consider the El San Juan next door if I find out that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve updated their hotel rooms more. El San Juan had a lot more ambience and was a lot livelier at night. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d certainly recommend the IC for families or groups looking for a decent place to stay in San Juan.", "Date": "November 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cPretty good stay\u201d", "Author": "strizek88", "ReviewID": "UR4144419", "Content": "Stayed here with my husband from Nov. 19-24.

We were able to check in at 4:00 and headed to our ocean view room on the 7th floor. Room was just okay, but the balcony was a joke. There is only one chair on each balcony and there is barely enough room for that! Bathroom is small with a very low ceiling. Beach immediately outside the hotel had a ton of seagrass. Not sure if this changes due to tides, but it made me not want to go in the water. Also, if you're looking for gorgeous water, this is not the place to be. We ended up spending time at the pool instead. Very nice pool area, ample chairs, free bottled water and grea drinks from Ciao (don't do the frozen ones, try the Rum Island Tea). We didn't try any of the hotel restaurants as nothing interested us (why go to Ruth's Chris when you can go at home?). There aren't a ton of great choices within walking distance, so we had to cab it to Old San Juan a few nights. We did have an excellent dinner at Tangerine at The Water Club - what a cool hotel!

Asked next day, advised room avail if we wanted to pay $40 extra per day. Worth the money for an ocean view/city view not the most appealing. Very close to airport can see & hear planes from hotel room/Some buildings in the city look very run down. There were some really nice rooms that had patios that were steps from the pool and beach. If I ever stay again I would book that. Taxi from airport $9 going to hotel but $11 from hotel which we found strange!!! Quick easy access to & from airport which is a plus for those on a short trip. I was very concerned about the weather since the weather reports showed rain with a dark cloud every day. It was rainy and overcast the entire 1st day so we spent the night enjoying the casino (just played nickel slots which were alot of fun but not very loose)def not VEGAS...lol/won & lost, basically broke even but had lots of fun. Got free drinks at the casino while playing but had to look for a waitress since we were only playing nickels..lol. My husband does not play the slots but was happy watching the game on a HUGE TV located in the casino. We did eat at the Japanese Steak House inside the hotel which was alot of fun , got to meet some other people at our table. Price ok approx $50 for the two of us. Prayed that night for sun and the next three days were sunny (YIPEE!!)..did have periods of quick showers. Jumped in the Jacuzzi during brief showers, nice & hot/bubbly or lounged in nice padded chair under tent or umbrella because rain usually didn't last long. It does get overcast at times so be sure to use sunblock as you can burn very fast . Beach was nice...golden sand not white but was raked every morning. Look closly when walking on beach to observe little clams being washed ashore/little lizards running around grounds of hotel. If you order a drink from the beach it has a surcharge...paid $9+tip for a mudslide from Splash Bar but it was VERY GOOD. Snorkeling/Fishing and other tours can be booked at pool hut. Plenty of clean towels and free bottled water. Snorkeling canceled due to rough water. Had alot of wind. Spent 2 lazy days on beach and at pool. Took local bus A-5 to Old San Juan .25 cents/nice shops>note: Bus gets very crowded had to stand up during 1/2 the trip on the way back (apprx 50-60 min ride to Old San Juan on bus) If you dont like crowds can take taxi for approx $16 each way(see Conciere before going to San Juan for good info/map) Took ferry (.50 cent pp)from Old San Juan from Pier 2 and then taxi ($3 pp) to take free tour of Bacardi Factory which included 2 free drinks per person. Good deals there on all kinds of Rum. Oh...the breakfast at hotel is expensive unless included in hotel price...we enjoyed Mi Casita restaurant for breakfast. A short walk to the right of the hotel/a very small place but had great coffee. Area also has grocery/liquor store..dominos pizza, ponderosa, burger king. Another shopping area w/a Dennys to the left of the hotel. Overall, Hotel staff was nice...best service was at the beach where staff will place beach chair for you. Security always on duty..felt very safe. One last thing...rooms were small and the balcony is for one person only. Rooms were clean/did not see any bugs or anything like that.

Note that this review is from a 25 year old (female) and traveled with my friend- same age. I was overall very happy with this hotel. The hotel is a five minute drive from the airport, which was great. This also means you will hear the planes -this did not bother us. We had arrived early, about 2 hrs prior to check in time, but we were given our room right away, no waiting, which was great. The room was nice, we had a city view- this was not a big deal as i didnt plan to spend my vacation in my room. My first impression was that all the staff were extremely helpful and very nice. The beach was clean, warm water- not crystal clear as compared to other islands, but still very nice. The pool was nice although we mostly stayed at the beach. The food / drinks at the hotel were a bit pricey( although good). Head across the street where you can pick up drinks/snacks at the supermarket, and there are plenty of american chains for a cheap breakfast/lunch. Also, Mi Casita is very reasonable although plan to wait for a while- service was a bit slow but food was still good. For dinner we mostly ate away from the hotel because we wanted to try as many local restaurants as possible. I highly recommend Ajili Mojili ( sp?) Food was excellent- definetly the best that I had while in PR. As far as nightlife at the hotel, there is a small bar in the lobby ( nice spot to get a drink and hang out- low key) and there is a casino. The casino in the hotel was ok for my purposes, Im not a big gambler so I really cant comment. Nightclubs- We went to Babylon - at the El san juan ( their lobby on the weekend was packed - in comparison to IC). We also went to senor frogs,Pool Palace and Lazer- there are alot of clubs & bars in the area- depending on what kind of music you like. Concierge & staff in the hotel were helpful in giving us some ideas. As far as the weather, prior to leaving I checked the forecast which said rain every day, I was a little worried, but if it rained, it was for about 10 minutes then it cleared up. We did not lose any days due to the rain. I would definetly recommend taking the tour to El Yunque ( bring an umbrella), tour was great, rainforest & waterfalls were beautiful. Old San Juan has alot of great shopping and plenty of restaurants. You can take the bus for .25 ( but the last bus out of Old San Juan was 9pm- so we always took a taxi).

The meal at Ruth's Chris was delicious, the pool was beautiful, and although my French Toast from Room Service was not hot, it was very good. The only problem arose when workmen began repairing something, somewhere, banging on whatever they were fixing, at 7:30am. I called the front desk and the banging stopped with 5 minutes of the call (and five minutes is probably much longer than it really took). I was promptly brought pillows when I requested them and the concierge was very helpful when advising us of activities during our very short stay, including taking into account that I was 6 months pregnant and couldn't participate in certain activities. The hotel was perfect - close to the beach, airport, and a not-so-short bus ride through a rough part of San Juan to Old San Juan.

Why: A beach holiday to relax and to celebrate my birthday. Where: Hotel InterContinental Resort and Casino, San Juan Details: We were greeted warmly and were checked-in quickly. We were automatically upgraded to ocean view (room 1424), as my husband is a platinum member of the Priority Club. We stayed four nights on points and paid for three nights, it was a steal. We went to have a look at our room and I phoned guest services to request that our mini-bar be cleared out so we could have use of the fridge. Our every request was immediately and graciously taken care of. I think the fellow was knocking on the door before I hung up the phone. One can never get tired of hearing, \"Right away, Madam!\" and \"Consider it done.\" We were a bit worried at first as our room was right across from the elevators but we heard nothing the whole week, not a footstep, voices, air traffic, plumbing. We slept like babies in the king bed, which was soft and had lots of fluffy pillows. We had an amazing view and the room very clean with everything looking spanking fresh and new. The bathroom could have been bigger, but it was clean with excellent water pressure in both the hopper and the shower. The room came with a room safe that was well used, a cd/soundmaker alarm clock that was used a couple of times and an ironing board and iron that was never used. The pool area was the best I've ever encountered. Plenty of comfy lounge chairs, lots of umbrellas and shady palm trees and the pool itself is enormous and well maintained with lovely waterfalls and a very hot Jacuzzi, which we used quite a bit. The pool towels were nice and big and we exchanged them for dry ones whenever we wanted. The complimentary ice-cold water was also an excellent amenity that we really enjoyed. The stretch of beach that the hotel sits on is beautiful, we walked on the beach and swam a couple of times, but not even the beach could eclipse the resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool area and amenities. The concierge staff was warm and friendly. We got great recommendations, excellent advice and fabulous service. The housekeeping staff was very thorough and offered us turndown service nightly. The wake-up calls were accurate and always had a follow up call to make sure we got the initial wake up call. Hotel dining: Splash: Our lunch was brought to us at our lounge chairs. Totally overpriced for what it was, but the service was good and the setting could not be beat. Drinks by the pool were a bit overpriced but that wasn't a shock. The Voodoo Juice for two at $14 initially and then $10 for refills (for two) turned out to be a decent value for a delicious drink. La Terraza: We had the buffet breakfast on the day before we left for home. I had the full breakfast and my Dear Husband had the continental buffet. It was well worth the money to do once, we're not big breakfast eaters and most days just had coffee and biscuits in the room. The quality of food and service was excellent. The condiments for the hot oatmeal were mouthwatering and the cheese blintzes, well I'm still dreaming of them. Oh, did I mention that Puerto Rico has the best coffee EVER? I actually took it black with a bit of sweetener and I never take my coffee with less than half cream. Momoyama: We started with the sushi pizza and then had the teppanyaki meal. The sushi pizza is a must. ORDER IT! The rest of the food was good and it was fun to watch the chef do his thing. But beware, do not order the sangria. One small glass was $10, I was shocked and annoyed. We paid less for a rather large half-pitcher of amazing sangria at Metropol. Passaggio: This is the Italian restaurant on the lower level of the hotel. We dined here on my birthday; we were too tired to go anywhere as we had visited the rainforest that morning. We were totally surprised at how good this meal was. Our waiter was top notch. It was really dim with soft Italian music in the background. It was a bit musty, but soon there was delicious smells floating around. The Spanish Garlic soup was divine as was the baked mozzarella appetizer with the balsamic reduction and sweet tomato ragout. The pasta was slightly softer than I'm used to, but better than most. The pink vodka sauce was yummy. We didn't have dessert as my husband bought me a fortune in Godiva at the mall and we had that with coffee in our room. Ruth's Chris Steak House: Where do I begin? Our first meal was so good we chose it for our last night's meal as well. From the service to the wine to the filet to the dessert, our meals here were excellent and worth every penny. I really enjoyed the laid back feel of this place. The service is highly professional but the atmosphere is fairly relaxing and fitting with a beach holiday. The Ravenswood Zin matched perfectly with my silky buttery filet. Save room for cr\u00c3\u00a8me brulee. Other dining: We ate lunch at Barrachina in Old San Juan. The mofongo was wonderful and the very cold air conditioning was manna on a wicked hot day. We ate dinner at Metropol twice with great food for cheap money; you can't beat it with a stick. Order the sangria and the tres leches cake (just not together.) There is a really sweet cafe that serves gelato, we had dessert there after Metropol one evening and it was lovely. To Do: We visited Old San Juan, Bacardi, El Yunque, Luquillo Beach and Plaza del Americas. All well worth the time. We rented a car one day, took the bus once and the rest of the time cabbed it. The mall is huge and beautiful. I never saw so many shoes. The concierge gave us a little card to present at the information booth for a free gift as well as a thick coupon book. We didn't use any of the coupons but I got two pretty souvenir key chains as the gift. We went to the market across the street from the hotel and bought gallons of water to keep in our fridge. We stopped at a supermarket in Rio Grande on the way back from El Yunque to have a look and ended up getting lots of Alto Grande and Cafe Crema coffee for way cheaper than anywhere else. Also, the prices for rum and other spirits at the airport cannot be beat. We stocked up for the holidays and saved a fortune. To Don't: The bus. Just...no. Final Thoughts: The weather was extremely hot and humid and that can be really tiring. We drank lots of water and sought shade whenever we could. The pool was always an oasis waiting for us and we spent three of our days totally relaxed by it, though my husband made a couple of passing complaints that the music was a bit loud for his tastes. I didn't mind at all. I highly recommend the InterContinental San Juan. My husband and I didn't want to leave, we wanted to rip up our return tickets and use them as coasters just like in the Corona advertisement. I hope this review was helpful.

Everything was good. The drinks were also yummy and the swim up bar was a treat. The concierge was pleasant. And they have live entertainment at the bar and the casino. I recommend a room with a view of the city. Ocean view is nice, but San Juan is beautiful at night. Having family from PR I've never experienced the island as a tourist. And staying at the InterContinental was all the worthwhile. I have no complaints about this stay. FYI they also have a gym and Spa onsite. My husband and I highly recommend staying at InterContinental. Especially if your traveling with your honey or the family. A must if you visit PR is El Morro, El Yunque Rainforest, Old San Juan, and Paseo la Princessa - beautiful at night.

Old San Juan is a must for those who visit Puerto Rico(my wife is still raving about the affordable shopping). Even though the casino is smaller than the ones I am used to visiting in Vegas, it is still a lot of fun--the dealers are very nice & personable. One of the best things the IC offered was $5.00 Blackjack with very liberal rules(doubling on any 2 cards, doubling after splitting, etc.)--try finding that in Vegas. For the price we paid on this trip, we came out way ahead(especially if we had stayed at one of the more expensive properties).

We even had a lady that was eating there come by and tell us not to let mi casita's mofongos deter us away from the island's most popular food. We also ate at Dragonfly, and although we have heard rave reviews about this place, it was probably one of the worst dining experiences ever. The service was horrendous, the neighborhood was going through major water piping -- so we were served on PLASTIC plates & cups...and overall, just not a pleasant experience. Next door is \"TANTRA\", an indo-latino restaurant. That was our best meal of the vacation. Wonderful chicken tikka, and the service was amazing. Our waiter was very amiable & we miss him! On another night we ate at metropol, which wasn't bad either. They give large portions for a very reasonable price. nightlife: Babylon, which is located in the El San Juan next door is a great place for ladies our age.

One of the girls stayed at the Hilton Caribe last year, and she preferred the IC because it was far more convenient.

Second, the rates at the hotel are very reasonable, all classes of rooms. Third, it's right next door -- 2 minute walk -- to one of the best hotel lobbies in Carribeann, the El San Juan (now owned by Wyndham). it is the place to be on the island on weekend nights, with great bars and people watching and a casino i always describe as \"James Bond-esque\". The big deal at the IC is staying in the Club Intercontinental. request a 1st floor room. it is adjacent to the pool system and you get you're own patio and chaise lounges and umbrella, etc. a great place to set up camp by just opening your sliding glass door. and the beach is a short walk from the pool. having easy access to my room is always a big deal for us on beach-type vacations. I can't handle an afternoon frying on the beach/pool. The rooms also have mini-fridges, and we always load up with drinks and snacks at the nearby grocery store when we arrive.

Pool: Pool was smaller than others we have seen in Mexico, but still very refreshing. The swim up bar provided a little shade and great service and drinks. Dancing and music provided great entertainment by the pool; however, the music was a bit loud, but did not play continuously. There were plenty of sunning chairs and shaded chairs by the pool absolutely no problem finding a chair Beach: The beaches in Puerto Rico are open to the public so it was a bit different than being in Mexico - pretty crowded on the second night. Still beautiful and clean. No huts to sit under like in Mexico, and chairs must be rented. I prefer some shade while my husband likes full sun so we stuck with the pool except for short swims in the ocean and a stroll. Bathrooms by the beach were clean. Room: The room was available for checkin early. Very clean. We had to have a safe installed the first day, and the wireless keyboard was jacked so we checked out at the desk. I'm pretty picky when it comes to the room and I felt it was nice and clean. Casino: My husband is the gambler and he said the casino was just \"ok\". If I'm not mistaken it is collared shirts and slacks while gambling in the evening. Food: We did not dine at the hotel, there is a Ruth Chris steakhouse and a Japanese grill. I believe there is also an Italian restraunt. We were trying to conserve after being on the cruise, so we crossed the street to Subway where there is also KFC, Wendy's, Taco bell.

He even promised it would stop raining and it did! Beach: There was a huge storm hanging over the island when we arrived. Fortunately it blew out the next day. The storm did, however, churn up the water making it very murky and depositing a lot of seaweed on the beach. The IC was the ONLY hotel on the strip that had the beach raked clean the next day! The ocean was warm and calm. My only compaint for the entire stay is that there is a $10 charge for beach umbrellas that are not even in great shape. It seems at this level of hotel the umbrellas should be provided without an additional charge. Pool: After the storms the water was quite cool but did warm up in the next day or so. The pool is large and beautiful. There were plenty of chairs available even though the hotel was sold out. The pool service was outstanding and the pool bar was very good but a bit pricey ($9 per typical drink). Nightlife: They have a very nice, intimate lobby bar with a singer on most nights. A great place to start or end your evening. The guys liked the casino but none of us are big time gamblers. It was a bit too bright and cold for me. Definately the best place to be at night is next door at the Wyndham. Lots of local atmosphere and enertainment. Also check out the Waterclub down the street. The rooftop bar has a beautiful night view of Isla Verde. Its open air with a trendy atmosphere. The elevator ride alone is worth the 2 block walk. Food: The breakfast buffet at the IC is phenomenal. All the usual plus homemade waffles, bagels and lox, cheese blintzes and more. We purchased the breakfast built into our room rate which was the best way to go. We had lunch twice at the Ciao Mediterranean restaurant that is directly between the beach and pool area. Great place to enjoy the beach view and have lunch. La Piccola Fontana at the Wyndham was our best dinner there. Fine Northern Italian cuisine with excellent service. We also loved Dragonfly in Old San Juan. This is not for everyone though. Very dark atmosphere and funky menu. All dishes are served for the whole table and shared. My favorite was the Peking Duck Nachos.

Overall the Intercontinental is a great place to stay, especially since it's so close to the airport, you get more time to vacation before your departing flight back home :)", "Date": "April 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cLong review of short stay\u201d", "Author": "Chardo", "ReviewID": "UR3351163", "Content": "Wife and I (the kids stayed home) stayed for long weekend 3/31 to 4/3. Overall, everything was excellent. BOOKING: Used AAVacations, as we have done before. Best prices, very easy to use, no surprises. Well, one surprise which I'll get to later. ARRIVAL: Quick luggage retrieval at SJU. No customs at all, just walked out of the airport. I know PR is a US territory, but I still expected some sort of customs check. We were told to bring proof of citizenship, but we never needed it. Outside the terminal was a taxi stand with one person ahead of us. About 2 minute wait for taxi, followed by 5 minute ride to hotel ($8 plus .50 per suitcase). Can't get any easier. CHECK-IN: We reserved a \"super saver\" room. When I know a hotel will not be crowded (off season, week after holiday, etc.), I usually book the cheapest room upfront and then haggle for an upgrade at the desk. Our desk clerk started his pitch for us to join Intercontinental's rewards program. For $150, we would get an upgrade during this and all other stays at IC hotels for one year, plus other perks. We really didn't need the perks, and we don't plan on staying at any other IC hotels this year, so I wasn't too excited about the deal. The desk clerk then took us on a special tour. He wanted to show us the room we booked and the upgraded room. The booked room turned out to be a 7th floor junior suite overlooking the city. Very nice room, but the view was not exactly tropical. Then he showed us the upgraded room. It was 12 floor overlooking the pool and ocean. Great view, but the room (non-suite) was actually smaller than the other. I figured we don't spend much time in the room, so the ocean view would be nicer. But, I didn't want to pay $150 for it. We went back down to the front desk. I told him I like the ocean room better, but I'll pass on the deal. Unless he could give me the ocean room anyway....which is exactly what he did. Like I said, you can usually schmooze a free upgrade if the hotel isn't crowded. Anyway, I gave him a nice tip just in case he lost out on some commission by not selling me the plan. Other than setting us back some time for this \"tour\", it was a pleasant check-in. He even said that our reservation includes breakfast every day, which was news to me. My reservation documents specifically said no meals. I figured we're gonna eat anyway, so I'll either get a bill at checkout or a nice surprise. ROOMS: I didn't pay very close attention to the city-view junior suite (considered their standard room), but it was large and very nice. Our oceanview room was smaller, though not too small by any means. King bed, sitting area, very small balcony (chair can only fit sideways). Bathroom a little small (crowded with two people), but nicely appointed. Overall luxury on par with Hyatt, Marriott, etc. POOL: A primary reason for staying here. Beautiful lagoon freeform pool with waterfall, surrounded by lots of palm trees. Very clean, nice temp, not crowded. Plenty of lounge chairs. BEACH: Clean, soft sand. Very large beach, so it never seems crowded. Waves churn up the sand at the shoreline, so the water gets murky. Looks great from the room, though. Very short walk to vendors for jetski, parasail, and banana boat. Hotel employees place your lounge chair where you want, and waiters take drink and food orders right on the beach (and at the pool). CASINO: Disappointing to me, but I guess that's the impression you get when you lose. Small compared to most US casinos, but not uncomfortable. For comparison, bigger than Caribe Hilton, but smaller than El San Juan. Most of the island casinos have just one craps table and a few blackjack tables in use. This craps table had a drain at the bottom that just sucked my chips in all the time. We actually did much better (and therefore enjoyed) the casino at Ritz Carlton. Not impressed with El San Juan's casino (next door to IC), though the rest of that hotel is special. NIGHTLIFE: None to speak of, besides casino. There's a lobby bar with a singer at night, but usually a small crowd gathered there. El San Juan next door has much more activity. DINING: Breakfast buffet every day is very good. Not only do they make omelets to order (like most good buffets), but they also make the french toast and waffles right there. Takes a little longer, but much better than mass-cooked french toast sitting in a chafing dish. Breakfast is $18.95. Big price, but in line with other resorts. Also, we ate so much that we didn't want lunch. Add it up and it's not a bad deal. If cost is a concern, there are several options across the street for \"desayuno\", including almost every American fast food chain. We did not eat at any other restaurants at this hotel. Our first night, we went to La Casona. It was our anniversary, so we wanted upscale. Very fancy restaurant about 10 minute ride away from hotel. We had been there before and it was worth the repeat visit. Very expensive. Dinner for 2 with a moderate bottle of wine was over $150. Their wine list is very impressive, and can easily add hundreds to the tab if you want to really splurge. Second night we went to Metropol, which is about a half mile walk from the hotel. Place had all the atmosphere of a local coffee shop, but excellent food. Even with a pitcher of (very good) sangria, check was about $60. Best bargain of the trip--I highly recommend going. Third night we ate at Mi Casita, which is directly across the street from IC. Similar to Metropol (good food, no atmosphere, similar prices), though they serve mainly Puerto Rican food as opposed to Metropol's Cuban food. Honestly, the two cuisines are about as different as Chinese and Japanese. Kinda different yet similar. I recommend both restaurants. CHECKOUT: Always the saddest part of the trip, but here was the surprise. My extras bill totalled $18. Just tips at breakfast and a drink by the pool. No charge for breakfast. AAVacations was wrong, I guess. AIRPORT: Be aware that the American Airlines terminal has almost nothing to eat. Not even a Starbucks or Dunkin, which are usually all over the place. We had to wait 40 minutes at some concession stand for instant coffee at about $2 a cup. I'm not making this up. Make sure you have your coffee and breakfast before you head to the airport.

The food is good; salads with chicken, cubano and club sandwiches, etc. You can order from your comfortable lounge chair by the pool or on the beach without missing a beat. I recommend the \"Club Level\" rooms which are a little more expensive, but so worth the location; 10 steps from the pool/beach/food. No elevators or long hallways, open the sliders and you've arrived. The bed is comfortable, a small couch and desk ($10 internet access via ether cable) are just inside the glass doors. The Club Level also includes a club lounge mainly for business travelers that is set up 3 times a day with an abundane of \"on the go\" type meals and drinks.

We stayed from March 9-13 and had a WONDERFUL time. As a matter of fact, I went through a minor depression period before we had to leave :) From the moment we got there to the moment we left, we were treated wonderfully by the entire staff. We originally had a street view room and when we got there we asked to be upgrated to oceanview. They were happy to accomodate us with a beautiful and large oceanview room. The balcony is a bit small, but it was not a big deal in the slightest. The rooms are a bit musty and feel wet, but that did not stop us from enjoying every other aspect of the gorgeous hotel. The pool area is absolutely beautiful with palm treas, waterfalls, and very clean water. We had so many things planned to do during our stay and did not end up doing any of it because we were so happy, pleased, and had such a great time just hanging out on the grounds of the beautiful hotel. The wrist bands (which everyone complains about) are not troublesome in any way. The food on the grounds is very good. We live in NYC and are used to eating out a lot, and even to us the food was exceptional. You must try Passagio, which is located in the hotel because it's wonderful. We had dinner there 2 times but do not get the Chef's Sampler dessert because it's way too small a portion for $10. Ciao's Medditaranean Cafe (located by the pool area) is a wonderful and convinient place to grab lunch. Also, the Splash swim-up bar is awesome. Don't forget to try the Mojito's and the frozen Rum Runners (prepared by Danny the bartender) they are awesome!! We went right before spring break and it was not crowded at all, so make sure when you book your stay it is not during times when it's crowded because that can ruin the experience.

Hotel's best feature is its lobby area, which is sharp and attractive. There's a nice lobby bar and an active and lively casino right off of the lobby. The hotel's beach - being on Isla Verde - is very nice for the San Juan area, although generally not as nice as non-San Juan areas or other more secluded Caribbean areas. The pool area has plenty of chairs but feels a little cramped - slightly more reminiscent of the community pool than a pool at a beach resort. The rooms were niced sized and had a decent small balcony but surprisingly musty/mildew-y - additionally, our TV remote didn't work. The location is nicer for the beach than the Condado or Old San Juan areas, as there's less activity in general in the area. However, that also means that there are more nightlife and restaurant options closer to both Condado and Old San Juan than here. Between the nearby Wyndham, Water Club and this hotel, there are a number of good restaurants and bars to be had, but they're mostly chic clubby-types (Tangerine at Water Club) or high end steakhouses (Ruth's Chris and I believe the Palm at IC and Wyndham). There aren't as many good local options - unless you're willing to pay the $12 to cab it to those other areas, which frankly isn't a big deal. So, on the Condado/Old San Juan vs. Isla Verde question, it depends what you're looking for. Quieter and marginally nicer beach? Isla Verde. More activity with a more bustling beach? Condado/Old San Juan. Overall, the next time I'm in Puerto Rico, I'm unlikely to stay here. I'd either choose a true beach resort (such as the Westin Rio Mar, which is very nice but a 40-min ride from San Juan) or a Condado resort with a good enough beach, but a little closer to the other restaurants & activities.", "Date": "March 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york, new york", "Title": "\u201cIntercontinental Divide\u201d", "Author": "mapmaster23", "ReviewID": "UR3232819", "Content": "When is (near) perfection so uninspired?... when one visits The Intercontinental.

The staff was very pleasant and always helpful. You are very near the airport and can hear the planes, but this did not bother us. A safe and mini fridge are in all rooms. We loved being close to a grocery and pharmacy for American basics. We walked all over and rented a car for a couple of days for fishing, diving and the rain forest. They were all incredible. The original walled Old San Juan and it's forts were amazing. Be patient the traffic to and from this tight area is heavy all the time. The cruise ships come in this area at times it becomes congested. The beach and pool area at the IC were perfect. The beach chairs and towels are free and they charge for umbrellas. We took our three children that are in college and they loved it. The casino is not good, but we were not interested and never even went inside. There is a wonderful bar and live music at the Old San Juan next door or try the Ritz two blocks down. Their pools and beach areas are nice but smaller. We will go back and maybe explore diving on the other side of the island. Everything moves at a slower pace there, be patient and enjoy. The only rude people we saw were other tourists.

We had a \"Club Level\" poolside suite! It was no bigger than an average size hotel room. It had no bathtub, just a shower. The location of the room was great, but that was the only aspect of our stay that was great. On the first night, our A/C was not working, we called the front desk and they sent maintenance 2 hours later. He could not fix it, but he could not speak English either, we could not communicate with him, so we just showed him the door to please leave our room. We called back down to the desk and asked to be moved, they informed us in a very rude manner that the hotel was currently full. So, we suffered the heat for three nights, and made the best of our stay, we had no choice. The pool & beach were very nice areas. The beach had chairs and umbrellas that you could rent for $10 each. So $30 later, we were set up on the beach. Even though you pay extra for this service... We were still charged a $40 per day RESORT FEE at check out. I demanded to know what this covered, if it did not cover beach chairs or umbrellas. I was told that it was for security personnel b/c the resort was experiencing security problems. This was scary.... We ate at Ruth Chris', and it did not compare to any others we have eated at, the service was horrible, and food was no better than any other chain staekhouse. It was hard to eat lunch anywhere! The food places had very wierd operating hours. Lunch was terrible when we did find a place open, we ate the same cheeseburger three days in a row. There were no options!!! Overall, it was a very expensive, very over-priced, terrible, hot stay. I regret the day I ever booked this hotel. We are Platinum Priority Card holders and thought that this hotel chain was Holiday Inn's luxury hotel chain. But this was not the case. I have stayed at many other Holiday Inns that were so much better quality and a fraction of the cost. We had used a credit card to pay balance at check out. When I returned home, I did contested all charges, but the hotel would not credit anything back, even though our A/C did not work. I hoped that they would give me at the very least a partial credit for no A/C. I will never stay at an Intercontinental Hotel ever again, nor will I recommend it to friends and family.

Open 7 am. - 4 p.m. If you choose to see more of Puerto Rico I would suggest renting a car and visiting Luquillo beach and El Yunque rain forest. About an hour or so on Route 26 East from the hotel area. We also made the drive south to Ponce on route 52. It took about 1 1/2 hours from San Juan. There is a free trolley tour that leaves every half hour or so from the Plaza Delicias in the center of old Ponce. The people there, as is true of most of Puerto Rico, were very friendly and proud of their city. On the trolley we met a retired policeman who enriched our trip by telling us so much about Ponce and its history. He wasn't a guide but rather taking the tour with his grandson. We met so many helpful people like him on the trip. While in San Juan you may want to take advantage of the ferry to Catano. It cost fifty cents. Not a bad price for a ride across San Juan Bay. Once you get to Catano you can take a cab for about two dollars per person to the Bacardi Rum plant for a free tour. Of course they promote it endlessly but at the end you get two free drinks and the tour is fun. The ferry leaves from Pier 2. This is the pier before the cruise ship terminal.

There were plenty of cushion chairs all over the swimming area. The beach was beautiful and clean. There was security which I thought was tight and a great idea.

The bellman and the valet parking guys were great too. They opened the doors for you and made you feel like royalty. I had to kids with us and they were very nice about it. Although, I would say that this is definitely not a kid friendly hotel. My boy was playing in the lobby and the head security guy had to come get us to take him away. The pools close at 7pm which I thought was pretty early compare to the resorts in the US. It gets pretty dark early there also. The casino was small but had all the tables.

I asked and the only answer I was given was go next door to the El San Juan and watch the salsa contest. That was not what we wanted to see. I think all of Puerto Rico could benefit by adding some kind of shows to their hotels for the entertainment of guests because not everyone is a fan of salsa or wants to listen to it constantly.

These hotel attributes are wonderful, and the pool is one of the better ones I've encountered in my travels. The gym equipment is not exactly new, but the view of the beach compensates for their age. The room is standard with no frills, but that is fine if you are out at the pool or Old San Juan anyway. The staff is not rude, but they are also not generally friendly or accommodating (I have no complaints or general complements). I got a good rate, and, at a similar rate, would stay there again. Interesting note: An elderly couple staying at the Wyndham wished to see our room for a future stay in San Juan. They said the room was nice, and commented that the IC rooms are much newer than the rooms in the Wyndham. I have heard much about the need for the Wyndham next door to refurbish and modernize their room.", "Date": "July 22, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Palm Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2267949", "Content": "I statyed at the Intercontinental with my family of 8 from June 19 through the 26th and we could not have had a more wonderful experience.

By calling the hotel directly, I was also able to get a terrific rate for one of their suites for me and my wife. I also spoke to the conceirge, Nestor, before we arrived and he was able to arrange for a van for us for the week (somethig I recommend if you paly golf-Dorado is 30 minutes west) or sight seeing ( The rain forest and old San Juan). The staff was great; the casino intimate; and the food good. Ruth Chis's was ok; the japanese place fun. I have four kids ages 18 through 22 who found the night life great in the Isla Verde section. The property is secure and safe; the rooms (we were on the 16th-top floor) clean and nicely decorated; the pool and beach area fantastic (plenty of chairs); and the fitness center, steam and suana more than adequate. Tip: Try the spa. Great thing about the hotel was it was across the street from a market so we saved money on soda etc; and were able to walk to nearby restraunts where the food was excellent.

Were we staying at the same hotel??? We knew ahead of time that the taxes are 20%, something you should have asked prior to your reservations. They are not hidden charges if you do your homework and ask in advance. We thought the staff was wonderful, very friendly and helpful. Infact, we kept saying thru out our stay how friendly everyone was that worked there. The concierge, Nestor, was the best. We used our Priority Points and were upgraded upon check in to Ocean front room. He gave us maps and directions to all of our sightseeing destinations. We had an extended check out also. We thought the pool was clean and the drink staff and security around the pool were very friendly. WE had a birthday dinner for my husband at Ruth's Chris was was astounding, food and service was excellent. There is also another good restaurant called Passagio and we were given VIP service. We walked over to the El San Juan and weren't too impressed with the decor, very dark. We weren't allowed into the casino because we were too casual??? We did eat at both restaurants on the 10th floor at the El San Juan, very good and casual. Drinks are expensive and so is food, but that comes with vacationing. I don't know why you think El San Juan is excellent, it seemed average to us. We thought the Intercontinental was by far the nicest hotel in Isla Verde and The Ritz was nice too. Funny how we had different reviews for the same hotel, same time.

We were pleasantly suprised by the quality of the hotel. Our checkin was smooth and wre were given a ocean front room on the 11th floor. The room was clean and nicely furnished with a King size bed and a fold out couch. Teh small balcony was large enough for one of us to sit. We spent most of our time on the beach and by the pool sipping rum runners and pina coladas. There was no fee for using the beach chairs or towells as someone reported earlier. We did not find the wristbands to be of any hindrance. In fact, we like dthe fact that they kept outsiders from wandering into the pool area. The beaches were clean and we were not hasseled by vendors, although there were plenty of folks offering drinks and other refreshements. Directly across the street from th ehotel is a small shopping center with all of the necessities, a supermarket, Subway, gift shop, and a nice cafe, Mi Casista, for an economical breakfast. I was able to but beer at teh supermarket and using a small cooler, drink it poolside or on the beach with no hassles. This was a great way to keep the spending down (Especially at $5/beer or $8-10 for a frozen cocktail). The pool waitresses were excellent, especially Rosie. We did not eat any meals at the hotel restraunts. We had a nice dinner at The Palm at the ESJ and anoth night ate at the Japanese Resturant at ESJ. Both were good though pricey. We also ate one night at Lupi's Mexican Place down the street and it was of good quality and we enjoyed the outdoor dining. We usually ate leftovers or Subway for lunch. Did not spend any time in the IC casino, but did manage to lose a few bucks at the ESJ casino. The ESJ is definitell more hapening at night and we would people watch in the lobby. At the sugestion of Jozell, the excellent consierge, we went on a kayaking trip to see the bioluminescent bay at Cabeza de San Juan. It was memorable experience and well worth the $70/person. The forts at Old San Juan were nice, but the area itself was too much like Charleston, Savanah, or new Orleans to be unique to us. We would definitely go back to San Juan and the Intercontintal again.", "Date": "June 14, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Isla Verde Hotel\u201d", "Author": "chrissyf", "ReviewID": "UR2170995", "Content": "We stayed at the Intercontinental over Memorial Day weekend and it was great. The oceanfront/poolfront rooms are an adequate size, although the bathroom is tiny. The pool area is very nice - with both covered and sunny areas - perfect if you want to keep your kids in the shade while you catch some rays. Although not really advertised on their website, there is a decent oceanfront fitness area and a spa, where both my husband and I enjoyed our treatments. The only restaurants we tried were the Ciao Mediterrean Cafe and Momoyama (japanese). The service at the Ciao Cafe was horribly slow every single time we ate there, although the food was fine for poolside/beachside. It is especially nice to get a drink at the cafe (which is right on the beach) at sunset. The sushi from Momoyama was delicious, albeit pricey. We also tried Mi Casita across the street for very cheap breakfasts. The casino was smaller than the Wyndham El San Juan but perfect for light gamblers - and the slot machines at IC really do pay - I won $750 at the IC slots!! The Wyndham El San Juan is right next door and the Italian restaurant La Picola Fontina was terrific. The Wyndham El San Juan is quite a scene on the weekends and it was great fun to visit the lobby bar and people watch. But the weekend bar crowd at the El San Juan was a bit rowdy - with the partying going on all night and some people actually sleeping at the El San Juan pool area. We were very happy to retreat back to the IC after visiting the El San Juan scene. The security at IC was very effective and would not have allowed revelers to sleep overnight at the IC pool. We thought IC was a good choice for families even though it didn't really have a kiddie pool - only a very shallow end of the regular pool. No one charged us for towels or chairs and there did not seem to be any 8am rush to reserve pool chairs. There was ample supply of chairs. We had our nicest meal at Ramiro's in Condado where the food and service was the most fantasic I have had in a long while. The staff at Ramiro's was so accomodating it was incredible. We arrived at the restaurant and our 13 month old baby was sleeping and, of course, we had left our stroller in our hotel room. The host offered us a semi-private room and actually made a cushioned bed on the floor (with mutiple fine tableclothes) for the baby to sleep while we ate. When the baby woke up, the host brought a real highchair - not one of those wooden generic highchairs, but the type of high chair you'd have in your home. The waiters at Ramiro's were also excellent - suggesting many off-the-menu options and were amenable to all sorts of specific food requests (low salt/low carb/no dairy). If you visit San Juan, definitely stop in Ramiro's for an unforgettable meal. We also visited El Yunque (the rainforest) which was about an hour away. We rented a car and drove ourselves. It was very beautiful, but I would recommend sneakers or other shoes with great traction and absolutely no strollers - the whole hike was extremely slippery. We took the baby in a baby backpack carrier on the shortest hike to La Mina Falls - which was very scenic and about 35 mins down and 25 mins back up. Renting a car was a good choice for us as it can be $15 each way to Condado or Old San Juan, which adds up fast. The valet parking at IC was not cheap though - $16/night. The hotel boasts onsite Avis car rental, but the Avis station was really offsite - you had to take shuttle bus to rent a car so it was not as convenient as it sounded. Still, the concierge and staff at IC were very helpful.
