The staff was fiendly (as most people in Istanbul) and the hotel had a familiar touch. Breakfast OK compared to turkish standard. Don\u00c2\u00b4t forget to bring schampoo as the hotel only provide soap. We should of course have changed room, then the review would have been more positive.

Con's -Service is horrendous. I am really not that picky, or at least I don't think I am when it comes to service, but we booked 2 double rooms, 4 beds in total more than 6 months before arrival. When we got there we were told our rooms were given up and we'd have to take one double room and one single room. They weren't sorry, they didn't offer a refund (of the difference in price) and weren't nice at all about it. The single room was a twin bed, had only one towel, one blanket, one everything (since it's meant for 1), they didn't restock anything for two, only for one, so we had to ask every night for extra everything. They don't speak English well and takes a long time for them to understand simple things, \"two towels\" , \"would like two beds\", \"one more blanket\". If it weren't for the staff, I'd rate this place at least average. I'd reccomend calling them in advance to make sure everything is settled, their excuse for the over booking was that the computer booked it for them and they have misrepresented what is available electronically. (Beware!) -Room is small, single room is tiny... there hardly room to unpack your carry on luggage. -Morning (5:00am) prayer is very loud since you are very close to the Mosque (I suppose that's everywhere too) Pro's -Great view from terrace, can see the Ayasofya and Blue Mosque nicely and also the water (the thing is everywhere in Istanbul in this area there is the same view). At night its nice to go up there and have a drink before bed. -Location is very close to Sultanahmet tram stop on the T1 line -Breakfast is pretty good lots of choice, lots of cheeses, feta, mozzerella (really salty), eggs, sausauge, hams, cucumber, phyllo dough filled cheese pastries, tomato, cereal, toast, coffee and tea are kinda lacking", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay for value with helpfull staff and great teras\u201d", "Author": "Sertan", "ReviewID": "UR116756829", "Content": "I stayed there in May booking for a good value in May 2011.

Despite having booked the room three months before our stay and specifically requesting a quiet room with a double bed and sea view and following the advice of a reviewer on here, I emailing our flight times for pick up \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I also faxed these details to the hotel a week before and received an email reply. There was no-one at the airport to meet our fight and provide the complimentary transfer, which was included with our booking as it was for 7 nights, with www.Venere.com. I telephoned the hotel and they asked us to wait while they found out what was happening. Eventually after about 30 minutes we were guided to a shared taxi, which dropped us near (not at) the hotel. We were given a room with twin beds, one on each side of the room, so they could not even be pushed together and the window opened out onto what is effectively a chimney with all the aircon units from the other rooms in it. It was dark and noisy and we were next to the lift. The TV was tiny and high up on the wall so only visible from one bed and it didn't even work properly. The room was very small and the light fitting was falling off the wall. I complained at reception and was told the hotel was completely full and that we could move rooms in the morning. I really wanted to go home there and then, but as there seemed no alternative, we agreed to that. In the meantime the receptionist was trying to sell us a tourist boat trip for the next day which cost 65 Euros each and she was being very persistent. We said we wanted to get the room situation sorted out first, so we would have to do it another day. Every day she pestered us about the boat trip, but if you go to Eminonu, where all the boats and ferries go from (walk or 2 stops on the tram) you can get a one and a half hour boat trip up the Bosphorus for 10 TL each \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that's just over 5 Euros each \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a bit of a difference and a very enjoyable trip. The next morning they did offer us a much better room, overlooking the street, which was fine, but it had no balcony or view. It was very clean, with fresh towels provided every day. The hotel certainly wasn't full that day, as there were lots of empty rooms on our floor. There can be no denying that the position of the hotel is brilliant and the view from the breakfast terrace was also superb. The breakfast was fine for me, as it had bread, salad and cheese, but my husband, the carnivore, wasn't keen on any of the so-called meats and nothing was hot. They also had cold chips (French Fries) and cold hard boiled eggs. That was OK until one day the eggs had not been cooked properly and they were cold runny eggs, which were revolting and inedible. The hotel web page states that there is wireless internet in every room and free internet access via PC in the lobby. This is not true. There is only wireless internet in the lobby and no public computer. The hotel web page also says there are mini-bars in every room which is also not true, there are just small empty fridges (still very welcome though). We ate at the local restaurants and found one in the Hippodrome (3rd on left) which served wine at a reasonable cost (most do not serve wine and if they do it is incredibly expensive) and had reasonable food. Most of the restaurants seem to pester you to go in. Once the hotel realised that we were not going to take the boat trip excursion, they then started to try and sell us an airport transfer for 25 Euros. We found one in town for 20 TL, which was very efficient (bear in mind it takes an hour to get to the airport because the traffic is permanently gridlocked.) The final and incredible act of trying to get money out of us, came as we were about to leave and the receptionist said wait a minute, you have a bill. We were very surprised as we had not purchased anything there. She said we owed them 5TL for the map I had requested when we first arrived! This is the first time I have EVER been charged for a map in a hotel. They are always free, all over the world, no matter how few stars the hotel has. We were so taken aback, we paid her, but afterwards wished we had not, there was no mention ever of a charge for the map! All in all, this left a very bad taste in the mouth. I could not recommend this hotel, especially if you are on business. There are lots of other small hotels in that area worth investigating and we heard other guests voice complaints as well, while we were there.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Location": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hoboken, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cshady shady shady\u201d", "Author": "fraqua3", "ReviewID": "UR80964764", "Content": "long story short, there is something shady going on with this hotel. we booked our room through travelocity.com but when we got there the staff was extremely rude and unapologetic when they told us they didnt have any room for us, even though my credit card had already been charged. they proceeded to tell us that we were very lucky, beacuse they found another room in another hotel down the block. they had us lug our suitcases up and down cobblestone roads to the other hotel, which happened to be a DUMP. but alas we had no choice, as we'd already been charged the $160 for a double bed at hotel saba. clearly the second hotel would not rake in that much for their dirty, tiny rooms. the shadiest part was that the manager from hotel saba seemed to be verrry buddy buddy with the manager from the second hotel - very very shady. these people are clearly taking advantage of tourists that have no other resources to know better. these are not people to be trusted, i would absolutely not recommend that anyone stay at hotel saba.", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kendal", "Title": "\u201cHard Matresss spoilt Stay - go elswhere!\u201d", "Author": "jimfol", "ReviewID": "UR79337881", "Content": "Great location for all the sites.

The breakfasts were very good, plenty of options available even for those who might not like the typical Turkish breakfast (which we loved).

We spoke to the woman at the front desk via his cell phone, and she assured us that they realized it is their responsibility. The driver told us there would be no charge. But when we checked out, the hotel wanted to charge us for the pickup. They claimed that, in spite of having filled in the flight information on the reservation page, we were supposed to have sent them an email with the information. After arguing for one hour, they finally agreed not to charge us. Recommendation: be sure to send them the flight information by email and receive a written confirmation from them that they will be picking you up.

The location is smack bang in the middle of the historic centre of Sutanahmet, whilst being just enough off the Hippodrome area so as to not be negatively affected by the crowds. I used the hotel mainly as a base for seeing Istanbul and so was out most of the day and evening. The view from my room was not too interesting, but then I don't spend my time in hotel rooms looking at the view. However, the view from the upstairs terrace is spectacular and the photos available do not do it justice. I had no worries or problems with the hotel in any way and enjoyed my time there. Having spent a week walking all over Istanbul it is obvious that there are a _lot_ of hotels around and the standards vary wildly. I am very glad I ended up here - mainly after reading through the many positive on-line reviews. I am more than happy to add my own. I will be returning to Istanbul next year and I have to admit that the experience at the Saba Hotel has influenced that decision. I will certainly be returning to this hotel.

The Saba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rates are very reasonable and represent an excellent bargain in comparison with the competition. The location of the Saba is really perfect for anyone wishing to visit the tourist attractions of the Sultanahmet region of the city. Although situated on a quiet side street, the Saba is literally a stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throw from the Hippodrome, which means that the Aya Sofya and the Blue Mosque are within a few minutes walk from the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so close, in fact, that getting to these places by any means other than walking would be silly. It is also worthy of note that the Saba is on the same elevation as the main tourist attractions of Sultanahmet. This is not true of many hotels in the same area that advertise their proximity to surrounding attractions but neglect to mention that you must climb very steep hills to get from their hotels to the main tourist area. Not so from the Saba. Also within a very short distance from the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at the other end of the Hippodrome \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is the trolley line that provides convenient and inexpensive transportation to the Spice Market, the Grand Bazaar, the University, and easy connections to the main shopping boulevard of the city, Istiklal. The rooms that I have occupied at the Saba have been very satisfactory. They are spotlessly clean, well lit and handsomely furnished. Towels and bedding are changed daily. An elevator takes guests to the various floors and to the beautiful balcony, where the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excellent free breakfast buffet is served every morning. The view of the ships at sea, as well as of the nearby Blue Mosque and Aya Sofya, is breathtaking. There is even a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153regular\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd seagull visitor on the balcony\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s marble railing every morning, on the lookout for free snacks and keeping other gulls away. The personnel of the Saba are extremely affable and helpful and speak very good English, as well as an assortment of other European languages. They are always willing to provide services and information about the city and assist guests to the extent that they can, regardless of the nature of the problem. The only negative note I must add to my evaluation of the Hotel Saba is the fact that on my last visit, the telephone is my room did not work at all. And the mini-refrigerators in the rooms are old and work very poorly. Both of these negatives are regrettable and really inappropriate for a hotel that caters to an international clientele. I must say, however, that when I expressed concern that the caviar I had bought in town needed better refrigeration than my mini-refrigerator provided, the Saba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff was happy to let me keep it in their big refrigerator until I left.
