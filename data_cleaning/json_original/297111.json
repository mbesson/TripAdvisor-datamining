Wanted something smallish, not in the main drag and something looking less like the huge commercial anonymous resort type hotels nearer the beach where you could've been anywhere in the world. We stayed for about 2 weeks and used it as a base to get out and about interspersed with recuperative days spent on the beach! We were not disappointed!. The hotel had a Mexican feel about it, typically Mexican vibrant colours, full of little individual nooks and crannies to sit and read, dip in the [choice of] 2 beautiful pools in either full sun or shade depending on what you wanted and the time of day. Everywhere was immaculately clean and spotless, all the staff were friendly and helpful with a sense of humour. Although the hotel doesn't have it's own restaurant, breakfast was no problem as it was served in the adjacent restaurant by exchanging a voucher given at reception - breakfast was great, fresh fruit, scrambled eggs, bacon, ham, pancakes, toast, cereal, juice, tea or coffee. The hotel is situated on a busy corner, about 5 mins from 5th Ave and about 10 mins walk to the beach. We didn't eat at the adjacent restaurant other than breakfast as there's just so much delicious variety and diversity to suit all pockets within easy strolling reach. The nearest ATM and Bank is 5 minutes down the road. We didn't notice the traffic noise if there was any! All the rooms open onto a pretty internal open courtyard or walkways and the building is 3 stories high [ground, 1st and 2nd floors]. Our room was on a corner, it was light and airy as it had windows on both elevations, some of the other rooms we glanced in whilst passing looked as if they could be a bit dark. Our suite had 2 rooms [but only 1 with air con] each with a queen size bed and with a central shared shower room. It had a safe [deposit for special padlock at reception], a TV but we didn't watch it as we were usually out and about. The only down side of our room/s was other than the beds and a chair at the desk there was no comfy chairs to sit in to read or just slouch for a bit. There is also free internet access, free iced drinking water from a cooler by reception, a giant superstore just round the corner for bits and pieces and an amazing Italian deli/small restaurant [Sabrinas] for takeaway delicious rolls, sweet and savoury pastries for lunch or for trips out. The hotel do organise trips, but we didn't try them and accessed the sights independently, so I can't comment about them or their value. If you like to explore a country a bit less like a tourist, then I'd recommend using the \"Communale\" which is a sort of cross between a taxi and a bigger bus or coach system. They are a fleet of [I think?, State owned?] minibuses which run from Playa to the surrounding larger towns, local people use them to get to/from work, they run all day from early in the morning till late at night and run about every 10-15mins, they only cost about the equivalent of \u00a32 each for a 45 min journey. There are dozens of stops along the highway, you just flag them down and if there's spaces on board then the driver will stop, if not you've only got a short wait til the next one. We experienced a selection of these from very clean, neat, newish with air con to older hot vehicles where you just have the windows open!. Quite a fun, safe way to travel! Ask at reception where the \"Communale\" Playa pick up point is - their livery is white van with light blue or red flash along the sides, great way to get to Tulum or Cancun and back again [not to the airport - no room for big luggage]. General Mexico travel tip here! - It didn't affect us, as we only had Pesos, but we noticed that all the State/Government ancient archaeological sites will only accept Pesos, not USD. Many of the more expensive restaurants appear to accept either currency, most also appeared to want to know where you're staying if you use a credit card, debit cards seem to be OK. The only down side to the hotel and that's being really picky! would be that we weren't expecting such a hard bed! It took us a couple of nights to get used to it, after which we both slept like logs!", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cPleasant, but with some downside\u201d", "Author": "mamabookworm", "ReviewID": "UR103167204", "Content": "My husband, my teenage daughter and I spent a week at Hotel Las Golondrinas. We enjoyed our stay, but the hotel does have some issues. The up side: The hotel is pretty, and it's clean, with one exception (see below). Our room was pretty quiet, although there was a bit of street noise in our daughter's room. The staff is very friendly. We had a package that included breakfast at the attached restaurant--a special menu with fruit, yogurt, cereal, toast, pancakes, scrambled eggs, bacon, ham, juice and coffee. It was good and plentiful, if not gourmet. Breakfast isn't served until 7:00 am, which was cutting it close for a couple of our scheduled tours, but it worked out. The hotel is just a few blocks from the beach. It's only about a block to the bank (to change money), and it's less than a block from the Mega Comercial (Playa's version of WalMart), which was handy when we needed essentials. We were also close to quite a few good, inexpensive restaurants (Un Sobrecito del Fogon, HC) and a more expensive, but very good seafood place, La Pesca. We also enjoyed being away from \"the strip,\" in a less touristy part of Playa. The down side: When we arrived, we were put into a room with a mildew smell that about knocked us over. I contacted the staff, and we were immediately put into a new room, but it troubles me that they would assign anyone to such an unlivable space. Our new room was actually a two-bedroom suite, which was nice, except that only one room had an air conditioner, so the second room stayed pretty warm even when the first was chilly. There was also only one very small TV, though that wasn't an issue for us. Though it was a two-bedroom, the rooms were small and there was only one straight-back chair, so we couldn't really \"hang out\" in our room comfortably. (The weather was very hot, and the hotel lounge wasn't air conditioned, so it would have been nice to be able to relax in a cool room once in a while.) This being Mexico, the beds were, of course, very hard. My husband and daughter liked them; I didn't. The walk to the beach, though short, can be a bit hair-raising, as there are several busy intersections, and drivers do NOT yield to pedestrians. (One corner sometimes has a traffic cop, but he only looks after the cars, and leaves the pedestrians to fend for themselves!) We actually kind of enjoyed the adventure, but you really do have to look, look, and look again. The hotel offers a reduced-price admission to the Las Mamitas beach club, but the club is a bit of a walk, and when we got there, the umbrellas were all taken, so we didn't use it. We booked one excursion through the hotel, and that was a mistake! I had asked the desk if they could recommend a private tour, so that's what I thought we were getting--but it was a _group_ tour. (I could have gotten a better and less expensive group tour elsewhere.) The tour company, Easy Tour, picks up tourists from various hotels and delivers them to a central location, where they are sorted onto different vans going to their destinations. It was time a time-consuming and confusing process (especially since the driver who picked us up didn't speak any English), and a few guests felt that they didn't get the tour they had asked for. We did have fun on the tour, but we didn't really get what we thought we were paying for. All in all, we had a great vacation, though I'm not sure I'd choose this hotel again.", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cPure bliss\u201d", "Author": "ApatheticAlbertan", "ReviewID": "UR94631283", "Content": "My partner and I stayed here from Dec 19th - January 4th for the holidays. We didn't know what to expect as neither of us had ever stayed here. We arrived really late, as our flight in Cancun didn't land until midnight. There was someone waiting for us at the front desk who helped us with our immense amounts of luggage (scuba gear). There's no elevators, so if you are of limited mobility, I would recommend requesting a room on the first floor. We wanted to upgrade to a suite while we were there, so we'd have a kitchenette available to us, but the front desk staff said they couldn't accommodate us with one for the entire duration (we'd have to move to a suite for a few days, then back to a regular room, then back to a suite). So we decided to just go with a regular room and we'd buy a styrofoam cooler for the beer! On our first morning out, we returned to find they had found us a mini-fridge to be used while we were there for no extra charge! How nice! The staff made some of the cutest and most inventive towel art I've ever seen. They do a great job at keeping the place spotless. Book with them for the taxi ride to and from the airport, though. If you do the private car, you'll save almost $80 usd over the service from the airport. They have free wifi available and a small computer area in the lounge. The wifi is really good, it just resets itself every 20 minutes or so, so don't plan on streaming any video while you're there. ;) There's two pools available. While I was studying in the lounge area beside the main pool, I noticed lots of little lizards and geckos in the foliage. They're so cute! You need to keep your eyes peeled for them. The pools are hardly ever used though, since the hotel is a 5 minute walk to the beach! Not only that, but of course it's only 5 minutes to the famed 5th ave shopping district. What a vibrant little area. It's also just a block away from the Mega Pelican, if you need to shop for sunscreen or snack foods or beverages. It's a very convenient location. I only ate at the restaurant once, but wasn't a huge fan. I would take that with a grain of salt, considering I'm a really picky eater. Oh, and if you scuba dive, check out the phantom divers dive shop, I did my open water cert with them and they are wonderful!

Summary: ideally located away from the main noise of 5 Ave but central to everything you need. Services: As I needed to study Spanish, I asked for a quiet room and this was obliged. The linen is washed daily unless you place a sign for 'save water' on the bed. The rooms are thoroughly cleaned, and overlook the central courtyard/pool. TV, hairdryer and safety deposit box included. Internet is free at Reception. Improvements: lighting, I agree with earlier comments that the lighting in the rooms are quite poor. Also, the pool is in the central courtyard and does not receive much sunlight hence sunbathers best go to the beach. Breakfast: Served at the adjacent restaurant: apart from the fruit, there was a lack of healthier options: cakes, yoghurt for cereals such as cornflakes, cheerios and rice crispies, and small slices white bread. The coffee is very weak. However, they do offer lovely pancakes known as 'hotcakes' and for a tiny fee of 10 Mexican pesos you can order scrambled eggs - well worth it. Again the service was excellent. Overall: As a single female, I would definitely return and stay at Las Golondrinas. Candy and Lucrecia work in the mornings and are extremely helpful.

We had requested a room with two beds in it as it was a friend of mine and myself. We were quoted $85 US per night. Went to check-in they told us the room was not quite ready but were happy to hold our bags for us. After returning, we checked in to our room and found that we had gotten a two bedroom suite with a two bedrooms, bathroom, living room, dining area and kitchen. Place was very clean, staff extremely nice. Had a problem with the toilet and it was fixed very promptly. The only grief I had was taht it was a little noisy at night from the cars on Constituyentes. Our room was at the front of the hotel and we slept with the windows open. it was not so loud you could not sleep by any means just could hear traffic, sirens, etc. i would definitely stay here and recommend this hotel to someone else. The hotel website shows the location between 10 and 15 avenue but it is actually between 15 and 20 avenues. It was a quick walk down Constituyentes & 5th.

We'd been staying at another place near Cancun and decided to come to Playa for New Year's Eve. We were worried about finding a place because of the holiday so we booked online and really got ripped off on the price. We paid $186 for a suite that was right by the front door and looked out onto the parking lot of a large grocery store. The next morning we also found out that the room didn't come with the continental breakfast (just juice, coffee, yogurt and cereal--Corn Flakes and Coco Puffs). The room was clean and the staff were friendly but the the quality is average--we shouldn't have paid more than $70. It's about 5 blocks from the beach on a really busy street--so it's also quite noisy from the traffic. The pool looks clean and is surrounded by plants with a garden-like atmosphere but it's really small and boxed in by the hotel so there's virutally no sunlight. There's also nowhere to really sit or lounge around. As we walked around later that night we found a few more hotels with about the same level of quality at much more affordable rates and closer to the beach. Don't waste your money here...hold out for something better.", "Date": "January 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cGood location, comfortable and quiet\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5476336", "Content": "Managed to get amazingly cheap last min deal on 'allocated on arrival' accomodation in Playa Del Carmen We were a bit worried at first when the bus stopped off at all the swish resorts on the coast but were miles away from any other civilization and were very pleasently surprised when we got to Las Golondrinas as the hotel is no more than 10 mins (max) walk into Playa del Carmen main street and beach which is fantastic The hotel itself is fairly basic but clean and quiet. Our room was huge with 2 large double beds just for the 2 of us. the a/c was ok but the room was back facing so was in the shade anyway.
