The room was spacious and smart design with separated corner for the child bed, so both parents and the child had their private space. TV offer included also non-German channels (which is not a standard in Gernam hotels unfortunately), bathroom was nice and very clean, toilet separated from the bath, which is very convenient for family. The coffee maker in the room (capsul type) made us fast and tasty coffee in the morning. Breakfast in the hotel was a delicious experience. The food was very fresh, served beautifully, very tasty. The choice of food was huge, starting from delicious German specialities, through the standard English breakfast, also including healthy choices as well as products for alergic and vegetarians. Last but not least the service was very nice. Hotel employees speak very good English (which is also not a standard in Germany), they were very polite and helpful.

Each of us took a room at the Mercure Hotel & Residenz Berlin Checkpoint Charlie. The hotel was reasonably priced, centrally located, and provided exceptional service. The hotel staff was extremely helpful and responsive. The hotel rooms were large and attractively furnished. My brother's room (222) was a smoking room and had a balcony. (All rooms are non-smoking except those on the second floor.) My room (616) was near the elevator on the sixth floor, but was very quiet for restful sleep. Both rooms overlooked different and attractive courtyards. The breakfast buffet (included in the price of the room) was extraordinary, with a large variety of hot and cold foods of high quality. The common areas of the hotel (the breakfast room, bar and lobby) were decorated attractively with modern furnishings. There was a computer in the lobby for the personal and business use of the guests. The hotel location in Mitte was within walking distance of all the areas I had wanted to see (such as Museuminsel, the Reichstag, the Brandenberg Gate, the Tiergarten, Potsdammer Platz and the Philharmonie, the Jewish Museum and the New Synagog, Nicolaiviertel and Alexanderplatzplatz). There were great restaurants near the hotel, and one of the best chocolate stores in Europe (Fassbender & Rausch) just a short walk away. The rate for the hotel was extremely reasonable. I will unquestionably stay at this hotel whenever I return to Berlin. One minor criticism: while there was free wireless access (as well as the one wireline computer for guest use) in the hotel lobby, the quality of the wireless connection in the room (for which there was a charge) was not very good.

A really nice touch is that on Tuesdays and Wednesdays the hotel provides complementary Massages if you book with Reception in the morning. It is only 20 minutes but a great service. The hotel does not have a 'restaurant' but does provide a range of Bar Meals at very resonable prices. 3 courses such as Soup, a Pasta Dish and Apple Strudel with a beer is about 20 Euro.

To put it simply this is why we rated our stay so poorly: 1) Upon arrival our hotel bathroom smelt of urine and we asked reception staff to kindly send someone up to clean the floor...it took 4 attempts to explain and even so, it was not understood and after a chambermaid visited, the smell still didn't pass as clean 2) the hotel and room was incredibly HOT all the time. I know it's the middle of winter, but sickly heat, to the extend we had to open our hotel windows all the time (even whilst sleeping) is ridiculous. We did not turn on our heating at all 3) Breakfast was 18 EURO each and really not value for money. By the time we arrived there was still an hour left for breakfast and it appeared like the food had ran out and were never re-filled. Given you can buy a decent breakfast for under 5 euro in Berlin. This is disgusting. 4) If the staff reception had to tell us something, instead of leaving a conventional message, they would stop our access to the hotel room by de-magnitising our cards, only to have to go to the hotel reception for some silly information that we already knew. I thought this was rather stupid. I wouldn't have even mentioned this if it hadn't happened 3 times! 5) Please don't call it a fitness centre and put large signs in reception, nor post on the website it has a gym. Call it a treadmill and cross trainer - full stop. 6) Internet wifi for the rooms never worked and after speaking with the m3connect directly (instead of the hotel staff helping), even they couldn't assist. Why outsource your customer service to an internet company is beyond me. The hotel staff were pretty much useless.

But in Berlin you need public transport, because the east and west \"centers\" still exist and the distance between those is quite long. For that purpose a group ticket for five five people is extra ordinary good choice,when you are travelling in a small group or with family. The ticket cost 15 euros per day and it offers unlimited use of public traffic in sectors A and B - 50 cents more and you can have also sector C included. The hotel is just between east and west. The rooms are quite big and well equipped. The breakfast table offers a wide range of possibities to have a good meal to start the day. The front desk staff is kind, they are willing to serve and they also can English well. There is also a small bar just next to lobby to have some drinks. The offering is quite limited, but it is understandable, because there is no visitors outside the hotel. The only thing to complain is the internet connection. In the lobby, there is a very limited area where you can connect wireless to internet free of charge. Otherwise you need to pay 9 euros for a day or less (5 or 3 euro), if you want have only a limited period for internet connection. Nine euros is about 10% of the room price which still includes unneccessary things like wired phone, tens of German/French/English speaking TV channels, coffee machine among other things that influence much more on the cost level than wireless internet connection.

All the staff were friendly. The room itself was bigger than my apartment back home! The free coffee maker in the room was definitely a bonus. The bed was super comfortable and the television offered many English language programs (mostly news stations). The breakfast was excellent. My only complaint regarding that was on my last day, I went down for breakfast at around 9:30 (when other days I was there at around 7:30) and they were out of many items. It did not seem as though they were replacing anything even though there were still many people coming into the breakfast room. Nonetheless, it was delicious! It was included in the room rate, but I do not know if it is included for everyone. Either way, there are many alternatives around the hotel, including Cafe Aroma down the street. My one major complaint: the \"fitness room\" consists of a treadmill (and only a treadmill!). I think this is misleading for those booking the hotel. However, on top of that, one requires a \"security cord\" in order to start the treadmill. The hotel only has one \"security cord\" and while I was there, a previous guest has allegedly taken it home with him/her, so the treadmill was completely out of use. It was suggested that I go to Holmes Place down the street and get a day pass. Mercure did not offer to pay for the day pass (which was 29 Euros!), which I think they should have since their website claims to offer something that they were then unable to do. Due to this, I would hesitate staying at this hotel again since fitness centres are something I look for when booking a hotel.

(And it was extremely clean.. spotless, with complimentary soap, shower gel, shampoo and moisturiser) Internet being expensive is a load of rubbish - yes if you want to use internet in your room for 6 hours it's 5 euros - but since when is that expensive?? And downstairs the internet and WIFI is free, so take your laptop / ipad / tablet downstairs and soak up the atmosphere of this great hotel. If we go back to Berlin we will definitely be staying here and no where else.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cConvenient, spacious & well located\u201d", "Author": "nyjafo", "ReviewID": "UR121083781", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel for eight nights in November 2011.

The hotel is located in the Mitte district, in the former East Berlin side of the wall, very close to the old Berlin Wall and the actual checkpoint used when crossing over from the Allied Sector. The location was good, a bit off the beaten path of shops of Friedrichstrasse street (about 2 short blocks away), and the busy tourist corner of Checkpoint Charlie, which made for quiet nights. The hotel rooms are very large, nicely outfitted with large (king sized) bed, sitting chairs and small side table, desk/counter with flat screen TV (3 English language channels, all news stations), and coffee maker with single cup coffee brewing machine with some selection of different coffees (very small cups and strong European coffee). Pillows were very soft feather pillows. Bed covers consist of a bottom sheet and a duvet (down comforter) enclosed in another sheet. Heating system was quiet. The staff were very friendly. Hotel rooms are very clean, and very solid and quiet - didn't hear any noise at all, except one morning when the hallway (elevator type) music was blasting at 6am. The breakfast buffet is outstanding with a wide assortment of cold and hot foods, and good coffee served by the staff. But it is not cheap (13 Euros), so be sure to eat lots and well to justify the price. One morning when I was rushed I only had a cup of coffee and toast, and it was still 13 Euros! (my fault, should have known to go down the street to the subway and have a coffee for 1 Euro and a pastry for 1.50). There are a couple of restaurants right down the street as well. The food is limited to breakfast at the hotel. The hotel is a short walk to the Checkpoint Charlie subway (or U-Bahn) - about two short blocks. Another subway station, where two subway lines intersect, is about 4 short blocks away. Both are in relatively easy walking distance, but the Checkpoint Charlie station was our favorite as it was close by and less confusing than the other (StadMitte, which has the two lines, but separated by about a half block). There is not much of a bar - just a few tables. There is only one elevator (at least in my part of the building) but it is quite spacious and not in heavy use. Desk staff were very helpful in providing directions, calling taxi's, etc. although some staff did not know much about the touristy things (e.g. walking tours, where to rent bikes, etc.). There is an internet computer and printer available for guests to use, beside the front desk. Free WiFi is available in the small lobby and in the breakfast room. Slow, but serviceable connection. Extra fee for the same slowish internet in the rooms, so I just took my laptop with me to the lobby in the evening and to the breakfast area in the morning. I regularly drank water from the bathroom tap, and filled my water bottle daily with no issues (stomach not upset or anything). I would definitely stay here again, and would recommend it. Berlin is an easy city to get around in, with the U-Bahn and S-Bahn covering most of the key areas. If you like to walk you easily can walk from the Mercure hotel at Checkpoint Charlie, North to the Gendarmenmarkt (Old churches, & buildings & restaurants), past the fancy shops on the Franzosische Strasse, to the Humbolt University libraries and churches/synagogue, to the Museum Island (Museums, Galleries and restaurants), etc. This covers much of the touristy area. The hotel is only a few blocks away from the \"Topography of Terror\" exhibition, and the Holocaust Memorial - both free admission, and excellent learning experiences. A short subway ride can get you to the AlexanderPlatz where there are more sights and food options. Also a short and easy subway ride to the PotsDamer Platz where there are plenty of shops, restaurants and malls. And lots of people. Others have said this is not a 4 star hotel, but I would say it is close to a 4 star in terms of service, room size and amenities and breakfast. I was not disappointed with it. One other thing - the rate I received was approx $155 per night, but as the weekend arrived the rates jumped to $275 per night, so I moved hotels for the last night to a much simpler and cheaper hotel (Etap Hotel Alexanderplatz) about 10 blocks from Alexanderplatz, ($60 per night), which was fine and clean but very spartan (I felt like I was staying in an Ikea display room!). Very good value if you only want to sleep in your room, although it did have a flat screen TV with Satellite service and more English channels.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cFunctional but no four star\u201d", "Author": "sircampalot1", "ReviewID": "UR120710587", "Content": "Location?

In fact, if you walk along to the intersection of Schuetzenstrasse and Freidrichstrasse, and read the hoardings up along the site of the wall, you can even pick out the building from the photos from the 1980's in which the hotel is now housed before the wall came tumbling down. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, and the rooms are absolutely spotless. Some have coffee machines and flat screen TV's and balconies. There's a sauna. The U-Bahn at Stadtmitte is 3 minutes walk away on a direct line to a bus connection to Tegel.

Great room we got with balcony, the room itself was around 45m2 not included toilet and bathroom which are separeted from eachother. As the hotel does have a sauna ask for a complimentery bathrope with slippers as the will profite you happely and leave them in your room when you check-out. We didn't use the breakfast as we are taking some along the way while we are exploiring the city. To do so we used the hop on hop off bus.

We got by train to the amazing HauptBahnhof Berlin and transfer to Metro to Stadtmitte stop (U6) to then walk to the hotel 10 min. The hotel is just two blocks away of the FriedrichStrasse which is one of the coolest avenues of the city. Also, its 3 blocks away of the Charly Check point (maurer museum) and 4 blocks away of the open exhibition where there is a real part of the original Berlin Wall. The area is really quite, therefore you have a major site steps away, but with no noise at all. At the front desk, there were two employees very polite that welcome us. We tried to check in early (around 11am) but it was not possible and we were offered to leave our luggage nicely. Therefore we decided to start our 1st. day of sightseeing. At the charly checkpoint site ALL sightseeing buses make a stop, so there is plenty of options to take whatever you like the most. They operate full day (9am/6pm). I believe this is one of the best ways to get all main attractions in Berlin. Tip: have the full tour at the first time, and then, when you finished you may choose where to hop off. I highly recommend you take the time to get off coupple of times...Berlin has a really nice spots and you get them better on the ground!. When we got back, around 6pm, our keys were ready and a smile from the receptionist lady was refreshing. She told me I had one of the nicest room at the hotel ( I just cant remember the number, but it was on the 4th floor and you had to \"transfer\" elevators, no big deal in fact). When we got into the room, I realized what the lady meant. The room WAS HUGE!!!!...believe me... it was the biggest room I ever been to...two levels as two complety different rooms connected by a stair. Big-big-big everywhere. It was a balcony as well (indoors, but nice) a kitchenette, living room...the only down it was that we had only one bathroom at it was small compare to the size of the rest of the room, but still good enough. All the hotel is spotless clean and you feel it nice and warm. We did not try breakfast at the hotel, having not included in our room rate. In stead, we went to a close small supermarket (2 blocks away) and bought essentials for starting our day without spending too much money (I believe breakfast was around 18euros per person, which is quite pricey). Check out was easy and quick. We left our lugagge again because we have a late flight leaving from Tegel Airport. TIP: with the U6 Line, the one that also gets you the closest possible to the hotel, it also has a PERFECT connection to Tegel Airport by metro/bus. Just take the U6 line to ALT-TEGEL direction and get off at the Kurt-Schumacher-Platz stop and then, with the same ticket, transfer to BUS 128 which will put you in front of the departure halls at Berlin Tegel Airport. A 35 min rushless and cheap way to get to the airport. I highly recommend this hotel for its location and service.

Also while leaving they helped us to get a good taxi to airport. Room and toilet were very spacious and cleaned very well every day. They also had decent toiletries. We really liked the potato soup from there. The breakfast was very delicious with a lot of options. Location of the hotel is the best part. A lot of shopping areas near by. Underground metro station is only a few minutes walk. There are many italian restaurants around. And one of the best Thai restaurants also (Sisaket). Many attractions are at walkable distance. There are some very small, not-serious negatives also. May be I should call these as improvement suggessions. 1. When I booked through accorhotels.com, I added my initials with my last name. But in the hotel system, it was added automatically to the first name. Because of this, when I tried to retrieve the booking online by providing last name as I gave while booking, the system was always showing that the booking cannot be found. I got panic and had to email the hotel to confirm that the booking still exists. 2. There is no shuttle service from airport to this hotel. So I wrote a mail to the hotel asking the route. The reply stated, \"Take the bus TXL from the Airport to Kurt-Schumacher-Platz and then from there U6\". I decided to look up this route once again in bvg.de. It was actually not TXL but 128 bus. I was happy that I looked it up before my travel. 3. Before my travel, my credit card was charged for the whole amount, but when I arrived at the hotel reception, they asked me again to make a 1 cent payment with the same credit card. I did not understand what that was for.. 4. Our room was in the 8th floor, but the lift was available only till 7th floor. So we had to climb the stairs for one floor every time. 5.

Our first stop was Berlin and the Mercure at Checkpoint Charlie. Our experience was so mixed it is hard to determine if we will return to the hotel on our next trip to Berlin. The hotel was nice overall and is located in a great section of Berlin. Potsdamer Platz, Brandenburg Gate, Museum Island -- all of these are relatively close walking distances to the hotel The neighborhood is relatively quiet and felt very safe. A number of good restaurants are within short walks of the hotel. The rooms were perfect for a group of adults. We had \"family\" rooms which were basically two bedroom suites with a shared bathroom. This worked out very well and we were pleased with the cost/quality ratio. The negatives really came in terms of the rest of the experience. The staff was pleasant but not helpful. We arrived midday from the U.S. understanding we may not be able to get into our rooms immediately. They checked with housekeeping, asked us to go to lunch, and then we were to check back with reception. The official check-in time was 3pm. We arrived back from lunch at 2:30pm. Seven travelers in from overnight journeys. The staff appeared ready to send us upstairs when the acting manager (who had not been in when we arrived) refused to let us into the rooms until 3pm. While he claimed they were not ready, it was a miracle that at exactly 3pm the rooms were available for occupancy. (Note: we stayed here five days and the rooms were cleaned and ready before noon every day of our stay.) We were supposed to have wi-fi access in the rooms (the hotel, like many in Europe, charges separately for the service), but could not access any networks. We had two pieces of luggage lost in transit with a website provided for tracking progress. Connectivity was more important than normal. When I pointed out to the same manager that we could not access the internet he simply kept repeating there was wi-fi access in the room. The fact it was not working was not something he would even consider. Even logging on in the lobby was generally futile as the signal was so weak you were not able to connect 90% of the time. The final morning of our stay we were waiting on a taxi to the airport ordered the night before by the hotel. When the driver had not arrived 15 minutes after the scheduled pick-up time we were told simply \"we ordered the car and they will be on their way\". Kind of frustrating when you are traveling in a group and need the extra time at the airport to move through the check-in process. The overall experience was not helped upon our arrival in Vienna where our hotel was not quite as nice, but the service was so spectacular it made the Mercure staff seem apathetic at best. We all have traveled internationally (some of us extensively) and were pretty realistic in terms of expectations.

I was actually in my room. and the crook caught me drying myself, after having showered and ran off. The second intrusion, involved the removal of my Blood Donor card from the power switch. The card looks like an expensive credit but it is worthless. Third intrusion, I was having a shower, some one removed all the paper money from my purse but just left the change., My purse was full of money. I would suggest that it contained approximately,200 to 300 Euro. Who ever entered my room knew exactly where my money was kept, in a very large purse in ,my left pocket. All intrusions were reported to staff and all I received was blind indifference to my complaints and after having my money stolen, no attempt was made to call the police. I have made no claim for financial compensation, I just a asked that the CCTV be examined and the villain be brought to justice. I gave them a chance and they blew it. After putting my complaint in writing ,all I received a patronizing response and again callous indifference to the fact that I was muggeddin my very own room.

Apparently you have to book a week in advance (because of the terrorist threats last November) - major bummer.

All questions answered; all wishes granted. The breakfasts are absolutely superb (we remain grateful that our room arrangement was inclusive breakfast!). Endless buffet offerings to get you truly prepared for each day. In addition the hotel bar and bistro serves good food and drink til late in the evening - until 01:00 the weekend we arrived. The triple room we stayed in was roomy despite its narrowness, with separate bathroom and toilet, and plenty of wall outlets (a personal favorite). Hotel staff puts the rooms back in fine shape each morning. The Mercure has a great location within walking distance to Checkpoint Charlie (duh) as well as many other sites, shopping, places to eat, etc. We ended up extending our stay to six nights and it wasn't nearly enough. Internet availability is provided by a single wired terminal available for guests next to the reception desk , and a fairly slow WiFi signal throughout the lobby. So what. You should be outside seeing Berlin. The \"fitness room\" was a bit less than expected, a rather small room on the 7th (top) floor of the hotel comprising an exercise bike and a stair-climber, with an adjoining smaller room with a mat on the floor. Hard to find much inspiration here. Didn't try the sauna. No problem, again, since all the walking and biking we did in Berlin afforded plenty of exercise. Parking is available from the hotel; the lobby elevator takes you directly to the secured garage level for Mercure guests and costs EUR 13,-- daily. We would definitely fly to Berlin on our next visit, however, as the car wasn't used at all during our visit, and the seven hour drive from Holland isn't very interesting (w/ apologies to those living near the motorway on the way to Berlin). There are many places to eat near the hotel, or the nearby subway stop takes you anywhere you want to go in the evening. We enjoyed a very nice Italian restaurant a block from the hotel (\"Lungomare Trattoria Bar\" at Krausenstr.11) for dinners, and late evening coffee. The recommendation for daily excursions in Berlin is to rent a bike (said the Dutch guy). Head towards Potsdammer Platz and rent bikes to see this extraordinary city easily and cheaply. We paid EUR 10,-- a bike per 24 hour day, with no deposit. There's lots to see and do in Berlin. The history is rich and hardly limited to the suffering from WWII and the Cold War. Plenty of other musea! The architecture is amazing. The food, the beer, the shopping, the sites, the nightlife, the people.

There are several local convenience stores nearby which are handy for water and other amenities. The lobby of the hotel is small, but the staff at the front desk were extremely helpful, polite and smiley. We had a normal twin room on one of the top floors of the hotel and it was amazing. A very, very large room. One of the largest I've ever stayed in. It has a reception area to hang coats, bags etc. There's a small living room space with table and chairs. The desk is in the centre of the room, with TV, desk chair, phone and mini-bar underneath, then the beds are on the other end of the room. There are two large windows that open out onto balconies overlooking the light and bright courtyard. Also, a curious addition to this hotel room (which I love and have never encountered since) is that the toilet is in a separate room to the bathroom. The bathroom itself was of adequate size, with a walk in shower. There's surround sound throughout the entire room, so when listening to music or the TV the sound is brilliant. The staff that we encountered during our stay were always helpful and polite. We regularly call down for bottle openers, buckets of ice or glasses and we always had our needs met.

Searching both a good and not exceedingly expensive hotel in Berlin was a pain. After some time I thought I wouldn't be able to find anything worth a visit. And then I found Hotel Mercure Checkpoint Charlie which filled all my requirements. First of all, I'd like to say that the location is really great - one can almost throw something to Friedrichsstrasse out of the window and get to Checkpoint Charlie within seconds or to Unter den Linden within a short while. The stay was extraordinarily great - the day we came to check-in, we realized that we got a free upgrade to the Executive Room instead of the standard one we paid for. It was HUGE. And by \"HUGE\" I mean - \"HUUGE\"! In the room, there was a safe, wardrobe, two beds, desk and an additional table near the window. There is one thing I just have to write about the bed: the mattress was just AMAAAAAAZING! In my life, I've never experienced such soft and comfortable mattress. Sleeping or even lying on it was a pleasure and I heartily thank you, dear staff, for supplying such beds :) The room was very clean and nicely furnished. I chose to have a room without breakfasts (since I like diversity so I prefer eating every day in another place) so I can't say anything about this service. The staff of the hotel was very, very friendly and helpful. Few hours after I asked them to book a table at the Reichstag Cafe for my family I had it done (and, moreover, they sent me a message to my mailbox in the TV in the room so that I knew it just after I turned on my TV :)). There is also a gym in the hotel - I liked it very much. I haven't tried the solarium, but both the sauna and the fitness area were good (and, what's worth mentioning, free of charge!). Pleasant view out of the window, cosy atmosphere - could I want more? :) There is also a nice thing about the parking place - it's hidden underground so we can't bother that someone throws something at our car from the street. There is of course a lift from the underground level straight to the hotel so we can go to our car every time we want without even going to the street. OK, now let's find some cons :) One day my room wasn't cleaned even though I didn't ask anyone to skip my room during the cleaning. However I informed a lady at the desk about this and not only did it never happen again but also they proposed me to clean my room right after I told them about the problem. There is also another bad thing about the cleaning staff - the last day I was staying there, they didn't provide me new soap bars or tissues. I really didn't like it cause it looked like \"OK, you're leaving anyway, so let's not bother with you anymore..\". Then, the main cons are the merits of the cleaning staff. I also didn't like the fact that the Internet connection wasn't free of charge - however, it's a disadvantage of almost all four-star hotels in Europe... Even though I like to find faults or even cavil, I simply can't find any other things to point out as \"bad\" in this hotel. Let this be a testimony of the hotel's quality :) Summing up, the hotel is amazing. Everything here made me happy - from such trifles as the awesome mattresses through extremely helpful staff to the vast room.

On check-in, the hotel attempted to charge extra for the girls, but we pointed out that we had been perfectly clear on our booking and had paid in advance because of that. The misunderstanding was satisfactorily resolved. Another problem is that we had requested a non-smoking room, and were not given one. 30 minutes later, all sorted out. (However, it's worth adding that Berlin as a whole has a 1970s attitude to smoking - highly tolerated). The room was great - two bedrooms, one of which was large enough to accommodate pre-dinner drinks for eight people. Beds very comfortable. As usual with most hotels, the mini-bar was stupidly expensive, so we didn't bother. Breakfast at 18Euros was also costly, but opinion varied on this - I thought it poor value, with a limited selection of food and poor coffee. My partner was more pleased, as were most others in the group. Being from the UK, I found bar prices also very expensive - 4.50Euros for 500mls of average beer. There is no free internet in the rooms - the lobby area has free wireless reception, and a computer for guest usage. The lobby was also good for pulling together the 20+ party of people, and very pleasant anyway. The location is great - near Checkpoint Charlie, close to the underground and buses, and within walking distance of many great restaurants and facilities - for example, we walked to the Sony Centre Potsdammerplatz twice to go to the cinema.

So a comparison may be in order. They are seven minutes walk away from each other - Checkpoint Charlie to the Gendarmenmarkt. Both are excellent central places to stay with convenient U2 and U6 S-Bahn at hand. Halfway between the hotels lies a good and well-stocked supermarket (Kaisers at north side Friedrichstrasse 60). The Mercure was a very welcoming hotel (and my warmest thanks to Liese and her colleagues for making it so). I had an internal room onto the treed rectangular courtyard; very quiet, with a pleasant balcony. The move to employ an Italian architect of note to design this hotel has certainly paid off: this was one of the most memorable hotel rooms I have ever stayed in, so beautifully thought out, spacious, relaxing, and just totally right in every respect. And unlike the usual cramped shower, the wet room was all a shower space should be. But the Mercure chain does need to think hard about not providing what is now taken for granted: bath-towels (necessary after an evening shower), toiletries (of which no shampoo, nothing), and bottles of mineral water. And the old TVs, which need upgrading, detract from the overall experience. I cannot comment on the food as I did not pay for breakfast, and cannot say that I found anywhere handy for it. As already mentioned in these Trip Reports, the computer at the ready in the foyer in a dedicated area was great to use and invaluable. To summarise: a great hotel in which to feel at home. The Berlin Hilton was similarly welcoming, and my warm thanks to Marieka and Rebecca for making my arrival and departure so pleasant. This hotel has a great setting onto the square, the perfect place to sit in the evening. I had breakfast in the hotel: attractive room (one area looks through onto the Square) with attentive and pleasant service; the food offered a wide, if not inspired, choice and made a satisfactory start to the day. Rooms can often mean a quite long walk. Compact and well-designed, I again had a quiet room looking onto a central courtyard with vegetable beds and glasshouses growing food for the hotel. Good modern bathroom with a proper bath, well equipped with toiletries and bathrobes. But not a room to linger in and read like the Mercure. The lack of a computer for general use has already been mentioned by others: this is a serious omission for travellers today (we don't all have laptops with us!). To sum up: better location than the Mercure but with a less enjoyable room. To eat: I ate several times at each of the following: Lungomare trattoria bar (Spaghetti puttanesca - excellent); Malatesta caffe ristorante (Pappadelle al funghi - excellent); Maothai aka Sisaket thai restaurant Mauerstrasse 76 (good lunch offers, overpriced in the evenings and empty). The two Italian are between the Mercure and the Hilton and reasonably priced. Guidebooks: if you take no other get Berlin (Everyman MapGuides) from Amazon. Brilliant!

We found it very clean, comfortable and staffed with friendly people. Our room was not what I had booked, but it was very large, sunny and had a big balcony overlooking the courtyard. I didn't realize this until our 3rd night and when I mentioned it at the front desk, we were offered another room (told it would be smaller), and the hassle of moving from an essentially comfortable room was too much. It would have been nice to have the bathtub and separate bed referenced in our original booking, but whatever... We did have a small kitchenette area w/microwave, cooktop and fridge, which we made use of. There were no plates or utensils, but that didn't make any difference to us. If you plan on actually using the kitchenette for a longer stay, bear the lack of cookware/dinnerware in mind. There was a kettle for making tea, which was very nice to have. Our room was on the eighth floor and the sauna was right next door. This was very convenient and we used the sauna several times. What was not convenient is that the elevator only goes to the seventh floor. If you have trouble walking, ask for a room on a lower floor. It was not a problem for us, except on departure when we had to lug our suitcases down two flights of stairs at 6am. I'm afraid we made a great deal of noise, but the suitcases were bulky and the stairs made of marble. We couldn't avoid making a racket. The layout of our room was odd. There was a shower/sink room close to the sleeping area and the toilet/sink part of the bath was at the entry door, quite far away from the bed. Again, we were puzzled, but whatever... The air conditioning was excellent, the room was very spacious and had 4 HUGE walk out windows to the balcony and we were generally pretty happy with our experience. The room was very quiet and we particularly enjoyed being able to sit outside in the evenings watching Berlin's Die Welt tethered balloon ride go up and down in the sunset. It was very relaxing. What was really alarming, especially as two women on their own, was the disregard housekeeping had for the custom of knocking, or even announcing their entry into our room. This happened multiple times. One evening, a man carrying a clipboard came into our room completely unannounced, asking if everything was in order. We were shocked and frankly, frightened. We had been watching television, right near the door to our suite, and had not heard a knock or anything until he stood before us. I found that unacceptable and from that time on, placed a chair under the door handle. There was no interior door latch. Other than that, it's a nice hotel, clean and well located. We ordered room service breakfast one morning and the Continental basket lasted us for three days. Very generous portions! There is free internet access in the lobby and the staff was accommodating when it came to printing our boarding passes for our flight home. Just bear in mind you will have to climb stairs if you are on the 8th floor and that you must be careful to barricade your door if you are concerned about privacy/security. We got a pretty good rate, but it would have been better if breakfast was included. My only real issue was security when it came to housekeeping's unannounced visits and I would not recommend it to friends solely for that reason.", "Date": "July 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, let down a bit by the WiFi\u201d", "Author": "OFVCAT", "ReviewID": "UR35334364", "Content": "The highlight was the breakfast buffet which was varied and tasty and could set you up nicely for the day.

It's also within walking distance of many other attractions that are on a must see list if you are a tourist to Berlin. The tube is nearby too either Stadmitte or Kochstrasse. The rooms are very spacious, comfortable and clean. Also as it is in Germany you will not get drink making facilities in the room and if you want a cuddle with your partner you have to leap the great divide - yes it's that German thing of 2 single beds making up a very large double. But the beds are extremely comfortable and the rooms have air conditioning. The wine garden in the courtyard is a relaxing place to sit with an excellent and reasonably priced glass of wine. Breakfast is very good with plenty of choice - things do run out sometimes but the staff are more than happy to replenish anything you wish for. A couple of things that may not be obvious (to us at least) if you want to use the sauna you need to ask reception to turn it on and they will also give you oil for the sauna and bath robes. The toiletries in the room are limited but again if you ask at reception they will happily supply what you need. If you are in the sauna and fitness room check out the sun terrace.

Went to see U2 play and get an idea of what Berlin is like. What can I say, the city is a great place to visit, we will return and when we do we will stay at \"Checkpoint Charlie\" again. We arrived at Tegal at 10:00 and took a taxi to the Hotel for the cost of \u20ac20 for a 30 minute trip taking us past the Victory Angel, the Brandenburg Gate and Potsdamer Platz so a nice mini-tour thrown in. We got to the Hotel expecting to drop off our luggage as check-in was stated at 15:00; however we were warmly welcomed and informed that our room was ready and checked in on the spot. The room was a \"standard\" but if you moved it to a London based hotel then it would have been classed as at least a \"superior\". Entry was into a nice sized hallway with a good size bathroom to the left and a generously proportioned room to the right. His and Hers wardrobe with an additional set of 3-drawers with a further 2 sets of cabinets either side of the bed meant that you had adequate space for clothing even if you were on a two-week stay. The wardrobe contains a safe so money is relatively safe and the mini-bar is well stocked so you have something to spend it on. The rest of the hotel is equally pleasing being light and airy in design, the foyer has a number of comfortable chairs and tables spaced around and leads into a separate bar area. The bar area is slightly smaller than it appears in the pictures but this only lends to a nice cosy atmosphere. The staff came across as genuinely friendly and interested in talking to us, when checking in I asked regarding the U-line to the Olympic Stadium and I was immediately engaged in a conversation on were we going to see U2 and had we seen them before etc... My wife had also found information on the revolving restaurant at the top of the TV tower in Alexanderplatz and we asked if they could make a reservation there. We were initially disappointed when the receptionist was told there was a 3-week waiting list, however her colleague suggested to her to ask the hotels concierge to assist; the next morning we were advised the reservation was made. Now they may not be able to do this for every restaurant in town but it was appreciated and the meal and views were excellent. I will close (finally) by agreeing with the comments regarding the hotels location; it really is within walking distance of a number of places to visit. Checkpoint Charlie itself is literally around the corner, left out of the hotel and first right takes you to Gendarmenmarkt (look up to the right for the winged Pegasus on the top of the hall). A 30 minute walk taking in Bebel Platz along the way gets you to Alexanderplatz; the Brandenburg Tor is maybe 35 minutes at a leisurely pace along Unter den Linden.

We are very familiar with the city and many of its hotels. We hold Accor A-Club Platinum membership. Check in is at 3pm. Our flight from London arrived two hours before and we went to the hotel, checked in, left our luggage and went out for lunch awaiting a call to say that the room was ready. No call came so we returned at 3pm and found that the room was still not available. The receptionist directed us to the bar but there was no offer of any complimentary refreshment to compensate for the delay to the room. Eventually, at 4.20pm, and without assistance with luggage, we were given the room key. We had written confirmation of our reservation details which was for a smoking suite. We found ourselves in a non-smoking family room with a put-me-up type single bed in the lounge. A call was made to reception and a manager duly arrived. We had already been informed by reception that all rooms were full. On arrival and having failed to persuade us that this was anything other than a normal family room and not what we'd booked she offered to try and \"see what can be done.\" A short time later she returned and showed us to another room (so it wasn't actually full) and to our dismay the alternative was even smaller than the last and still had the family room trappings including a put-me-up bed. It had the additional unwelcome feature of a toilet with a very noisy flush about 1.5 metres from the bed. We declined this room also and returned to the former to await a solution. We had both decided that if the hotel couldn't provide accomadation confirmed by them in writing then we were going to leave. About 1 hour into this pantomime we were eventually shown to one of the duplex apartments in the Residenz part of the hotel. It had a terrace where we could smoke and fitted the description of the suite promised. The manager was concerned that during our initial wait we had been left to fend for ourselves on the refreshment front and provided us with two vouchers each redeemable at the bar for \"any drink of our choice.\" It was a gesture we appreciated notwithstanding the delay. The accomodation was fine and the beds were surprisingly comfortable to the extent that both of us experienced the best of restful sleep in many months. Our time in Berlin was busy and we ate only breakfast in the hotel. This can be described as plentiful and of adequate quality. The main problem is that the dining room is clearly not big enough to cope with all guests when the hotel is busy. We dislike being kept waiting for a table and being shown to tables before the mess of the preceeding guests has been cleared. There was also a noise problem in that the hotel seems to try and be something that it is'nt with scaffolding and rigging gangs running around the place trying to set up foir some sort of show or exhibition when guests are trying to relax in the bar or looking for a space to eat breakfast. On our final day we decided to use our vouchers for a drink before going out to dinner in a nearby restaurant. We ordered a Bacardi with diet coke and a Brandy with diet coke. When the bill arrived the vouchers were taken in payment but we were asked to pay for 1 of the diet cokes as the hotel considered Bacardi with coke as 1 drink but a brandy with coke as 2 drinks! We were dumbfounded but paid for the coke that came for the brandy as we had had enough of this place, it's attitude to guests (even those who have been messed around and disappointed), and its less than acceptable standards. We have no clue as to the type of guests this place either caters for or wants to attract, but on our experience if you want a trouble free stay where you are provided with what you confirmed in your booking then you need to give this place a miss.

We were aware that someone had really thought the furnishings through. My only criticism was the light in the bathroom - terrible for putting on makeup!

Breakfast buffet was very good with variations each day, which is nice for a longer stay. Plenty of fresh fruit, different cold cuts, meats, cheeses, smoked salmon, fresh vegies, hot dishes, breads, condiments, yogurts and cereals - just a wide selection of everything you're likely to want to eat for breakfast and of good quality (the jam is not in little packages(!) and there are 3 or 4 different kinds of honey), not to forget freshly squeezed orange juice. They also have so-called Privileged Rooms, which apparently include a coffee-maker (which would have been nice to have in the standard rooms) as well as suites with kitchenette.

The check in was very fast and friendly. We were informed that somebody would escort us to our \"very special\" room, which I found intriguing.

Although I was a bit concerned about where we were being taken (since this was the first time somebody had to escort us to our room in a hotel), when we finally got to our room I was gladly impressed. It was huge, with a separate living room area and a huge bathroom. We had the spa and sauna in the same floor. There are only two rooms there so it was very very quiet. Breakfast was wonderful with a great variety of things to select from. Internet access was free of charge in the lobby. The location of the hotel was just great. We arrived to the central train station and took a taxi to the hotel for 10 euro. We could have taken the subway which is 2 blocks away from the hotel, but we didn't want to carry our luggage. Check point Charlie is two blocks away from the hotel. We walked to the Brandenburg gate which took about 20 or 30 minutes, but it was through a very nice shopping area so definitely I would recommend to do this at least once. I can't emphasize enough how friendly all the hotel staff were to us.

I booked the hotel off the back of the great reviews on tripadvisor. Hotel The hotel is ultra modern and easy to find. I took the train from Schoenefeld Airport to Berlin city centre. To get to the hotel from the airport, get the train from the airport to Friedrichstrasse, and then get the subway from there to Kochstrasse. To get to the hotel from Kochstrasse, walk out of the subway towards the crossroads at Checkpoint Charlie and then take the next road to the right after the crossroads, keep on walking and hotel will be on your right. Simple and only a few minutes walk from the Underground. If you want to buy a day ticket for the Berlin transport network, the hotel sells them. Just make sure you get the ticket stamped at one of the stations before you travel to validate it. The hotel reception will be able to give you a free streetmap. There is computer with free internet usage in the lobby. Location The location is brilliant and very central. It\u2019s round the corner from Checkpoint Charlie, the shops on Friedrichstrasse, and about a 15 minute stroll to Unter den Linden, so within walking distance to all the main sights. Yet the road that the hotel is on is very quiet with a lovely quiet garden at the back where you can have a drink. That\u2019s what is so great about this hotel - so close to everything but yet so quiet. Check-in The check-in was efficient - no queue - and we were given a credit card style \u2018key\u2019 for the room. You need the card to activate the room lights and aircon. Price The room price was \u00a384 per night without breakfast. Breakfast was extra and very expensive (18 Euros per person), so instead we decided to go the supermarket in the subway at Friedrichstrasse or to a bakery call Kamps, near to Checkpoint Charlie to buy a couple of croissants and a coffee. Room The room (number 520) was facing the back and so quiet. Couldn\u2019t hear anything outside or anything from next door /above - excellent sound insulation. It had air conditioning which was silent and very effective - very welcome when it\u2019s hot outside as I can\u2019t sleep well in a hot room. The room was huge with 2 really comfy big beds pushed together with 2 separate duvets - really comfortable beds and a refreshing change from the small \u2018double\u2019 beds often found in hotels - and there was also a single bed at the other end of the room. There was also a large desk with a TV on it (English speaking channels were BBC and CNN), plenty of cupboard space (one cupboard included an electronic safe) and there was lots of room for luggage. The toilet was separate to the shower room (no bath) which was a nice layout rather than toilet and shower. The only slight negative was that there were no tea/coffee making facilities, (but there was a minibar) but drinks (tea, coffee, alcohol etc.) were easily available from the bar downstairs near reception. There was a large bottle of water on the desk in the room, but beware \u2013 it cost 3,20 Euros. We thought it was complimentary, as we failed to notice the price tag round the neck of the bottle until we\u2019d started drinking it! Meals The hotel has a bar and also a breakfast room, but as I didn\u2019t eat/drink there I\u2019m unable to comment on the food. Summary To summarise, it\u2019s a modern, immaculate, well priced hotel in an excellent location, with friendly staff, and I would thoroughly recommend staying there. It was perfect for us as we wanted somewhere convenient, quiet, clean and had a good shower and air conditioning. The hotel didn\u2019t have a gym or swimming pool, but as we were mostly out and about it didn\u2019t matter. This hotel hit the spot - the only improvements I can think of would be to have tea/coffee making facilities in the room, and the breakfast to be very much cheaper. A great hotel in a fabulous city.

The room was much bigger than any I have stayed in in a city hotel lately with a clear bed and sitting area divided by a table with TV and seats ( should you want to eat in). There was a toilet and separate wetroom. We also had a balcony which looked out onto the lovely courtyard. Checkpoint Charlie itself (or what remains of it) is on the corner of the street the hotel is on. Walk right up Friedrichstrasse from there and 15 minutes later you are at the magnificent Brandengberg Gate and Reichstag. We used the underground and S-bahn system for the areas further afield .

Reception asked me whether I'd like a smoking of non-smoking room. I'm not too fussy about that, but since there was a choice I asked for a non-smoking room. The room however smelled lightly of stale cigarette smoke and had an ashtray + matches on the table. Asked about that in the reception while getting directions going out. They told me that the room is indeed non-smoking and the presence of an ashtray is a mystery and they would remove it. I simply ignored the matter. The room was very nice and spacious. I worked, took a stroll downtown, did some shopping, ate a small supper at a nearby little Italian caf\u00e9 that the reception guy recommended and gave me a discount coupon for. Food was ok and reasonably priced. I was very tired from the week behind me and still had work ahead and an early meeting which was really important for me, so I looked forward to a quiet night, took a good hot shower and went to bed ridiculously early. At first I thought somebody had the tv on a little loud, then I thought, no, there's definitely a party at a nearby room. Laughter, music - sometimes very quiet, getting louder at times. Went to inspect and sure enough, my room - or my bed corner - was literally wrapped around the wine garden in the back yard and the cute litlle jukebox they have in the bar. The jukebox was about 3 meters from my ear and the canvas roof of the wine garden started right from my window. Went to reception, told them of the irritation, asked if they would have earplugs. They didn't have any but were very responsive. There were two people behind the desk, the guy called the bar asking them to play the music softer. In a while the lady then offered to move me into another room. I packed in two minutes and called downstairs and a member of the staff was upstairs in 30 seconds. I was taken to a two-floor apartment complete with a kitchen downstairs and a bedroom + a nice bathroom with a good tub upstairs. It being in the top floor it was like I was transported above the clouds way above any human sounds. Anything can happen, but a hotel or any other business can be judged by the reaction to the unexpected. I am a light sleeper and should remember to bring my earplugs. I do not expect Berlin to sleep as early as I wanted to, but the staff seemed to genuinely care about me as their guest and they were very polite and friendly while taking care of the matter. The light smell of smoke in my initial room might be explained by the fact that the window gets all the smoke from the wine garden. Having lived in Germany before I don't think I would have noticed it then, but if you come from the strict Scandinavian non-smoking \"ordnung\" that I live in nowadays, you notice. The location is good. I had meetings all over central Berlin and walked everywhere. I love it when you can do that. The hotel breakfast was nothing you haven't seen before as such, but very good. I'm ready to sing a song for the coffee - hot, strong but smooth. I only stayed two nights and was too busy (or sleeping...) to really use any amenities or see a lot of sights, but the sights are right under your nose here and Unter den Linden is a short walk away. I saw a lot our tourists from all over the world coming and going and the hotel staff seems to speak at least very good English and French.

The other complaint is that there is just one computer and printer for guests' use, and it is located in the lobby.

My wife and I were there for a week--I was at a conference--and we booked a 7 night special on Bookings.com for 99 Euros a night. Our upgraded room--part of the package, I think--was absolutely HUGE, on the seventh floor with large casement windows that opened onto the street. The room and furnishings were spotless and contemporary, as was the entire facility, the bathroom large and user friendly. Another couple we were traveling with booked the same deal and their room was just as nice, with a small balcony that opened onto the interior courtyard of the hotel. By far the biggest and nicest hotel room I have stayed in in Europe, where small and over-rated is the norm, in my experience. The hotel charges for in-room wifi but has a computer--with printer, no less, for free--in the lobby, and also has free wifi in the lobby so you can just bring your laptop or other device down there and check your mail. Location is outstanding, one block from Friedrichstrasse and close (2 blocks) to both Stadtmitte and Kochstrasse U Bahn stops. (If you're there for a week, buy the 7 day U Bahn pass for zones A and B for about 27 Euros--you'll get more than your money's worth.) Easy walk to both Potsdamer Platz and the Tiergarten. If you're a runner, a great loop is Postdamer Platz/Tiergarten/Brandenburg Gate/Unter den Linden and back down to the hotel. Hotel service was excellent with the exception of the bar staff, which was average at best. (The hotel has a very nice wine garden, and seems to do lots of events there.) We did not do the 18 Euros per day breakfast, which seemed a little pricey, so I can't comment on that; there are several good coffee and pastry/muffin places nearby--one two blocks north on Friedrichstrasse and one half a block north on Charlottenstrasse--and that's all we want for breakfast.

It's a very safe area for walking around at night and there are plently of restaurants nearby. The other most notable thing at this hotel is the staff. very friendly and welcoming. We were three couples and had booked three double rooms. They asked us on arrival if we would do them a big favour by two of the couples sharing a suite, because they had overbooked the double rooms. It wasnt a big problem for us, because the suite had two bedrooms and was very big. They gave us complimentray breakfast and a free drink each at the bar for the inconvenience.

My grandparents lived in West Berlin but I haven't been back since the wall came down. The hotel is just on the former Eastern side of the wall, a minute away from Checkpoint Charlie and the Ubahn. Fascinating location - a bit edgier and more stylish than the plush fleshpots of the Ku'damm. The hotel car park four floors underground (like the loos in nearby great Italian restaurant Valentino) must have been part of a former Soviet bunker complex. Rebuilding opposite of 1930s building with bullet marks. Very quiet side street: beautifully designed modern interior. Evven a small gymn and sauna ontop floor. Family suite ideal for us (2 boys 9 and 11) spanning the depth of the hotel - two very large bedrooms each with closed-in balcony, and central lobby area with loo and separate bathroom and separate shower. Nice designer touches - really comfortable low double beds, separate duvets. Hand shower attached to the bath to wash hair - and a separate shower room. Very quiet ventilator fan to the bathroom. In the main bedroom a dining table which enabled us to eat in one night with our own wine (dirt cheap from local supermarket) and room service - meal for four for 30 euros. There is a good bar service downstairs too. Communal area isn't large but very friendly and the bar is nice. Very good breakfast is extra but we didn't have to pay for the kids. We used a lot of things in this hotel - big laundry wash, car parking for four nights, room service, bar food, drinks, (free) internet access in the lobby - and were suprised at how little the extras cost. Booked through Venere and got a good deal even though late in the day. The staff are very helpful and friendly. I'm very fussy about cleanliness but was impressed at how clean the suite was.

I would not recoomend the restaurant Maximiilions - very popular but some of the worst food I have ever had. If I came back to Berlin I would most stay here again.

About 50 m from the famous Friedrichstrasse and 100 m from \"Checkpoint Charlie\". Potsdamer Platz, Alexander Platz, Gerdamen Markt, Berlin Dom, Unten Der Linden avenue, Reichstag and many other interesting places are easy to reach on foot or by using the bus or the U ban. Berlin is a very large city but the is no problem to visit any place you like as the transportation system is excellent. The hotel is absolutely a gem! We stayed in an apartment which is situated next door to the main hotel. The room was amazing.Very big, spacious, with high ceilings, extremely clean, equipped even with full kitchen facilities and a Micro wave oven. Our room had no view to the street but this was not a problem as it faces the inner court yard which is very nice. All the building is an architectural miracle. An old building which has been transformed perfectly by the Italian architecture Rossi. The people working there are very kind, always with a smile and all the time ready to help. When we arrived we received an envelope with maps, suggested places to visit and many other informations which were proved very helpful during our staying in the city. The room service is excellent with very good prices. The only thing that is missing is an English speaking channel on TV. We never had breakfast so no opinion about it. In general it is a fantastic hotel and maybe the best value for money that you can find in Berlin. We booked this hotel in May we stayed 7 nights and without breakfast the cost was only 420 Euros!!!! If we ever visit Berlin again we know where to stay!
