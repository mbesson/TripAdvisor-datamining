The restaurant attached to the hotel does great cocktails if your willing to pay a little extra. The hotel room itself was very nicely decorated with lovely finishing touches, lots of toiletries provided. The bed was huge, much larger than a UK king size! Nice bathroom and desk area which had windows opening to the inner court yard. This meant we had an internal room which I believe meant it was quieter than if located on outside.

I quickly cancelled and rebooked into the Palacio de Tepa. The staff were attentive, helpful and spoke excellent English. I asked for a spacious room overlooking the square with a balcony and that is exactly what I got. If you do go to this hotel, try room 406, it is a perfect location (a 5 minute walk from Sol) and has triple aspect with balconies, all very modern and still felt classically Spanish at the same time. As for the bed, well it was huge and very comfortable. The breakfast was plentiful and special. A huge range of fruits, pastries, sliced meats/cheeses, sandwiches, cereals, toasts etc and you could also order a hot breakfast like omelette or I had the Spanish omelette which was fabulous! Also there is cava on ice so I made buck fizz with my breakfast too! The only down side is that we didn't stay long enough! All in all a wonderful experience and came back thoroughly relaxed.

I say \"will be\" because the hotel was opened last October, and you still smell the new paint in the room. I think it will be gone by the end of the summer. I don't know why odourless water based paints do not become the industry standard, also for wood; they are as durable. This is especially important in hotels, because they tend to keep the windows of all unused rooms tightly closed for hygiene reasons. Anyway, this is not a problem specific to this hotel, but common to all new hotels, sometimes even to older ones with bad material (paint, varnish, or carpet) selection. Staying in the room, it was also not an option to leave the windows open for ventilation at night, because it is quite noisy outside. There are a few rooms at the interior courtyard or under the roof, but balcony to one of the most joyful squares in Madrid is what contributes to the charm of staying here, so I would recommend a room with a balcony, in spite of all. The location is just marvelous! Most museums are within minutes; many good restaurants, tapas bars are in the surrounding. One of the best live music clubs next door, the other just next block straight ahead. The superior room at the corner was comfortably spacious, the standard rooms also reasonably wide; all with a simple but beautiful elegance. We had no major complaints about cleanliness, but I must say the cleaning lady was far too hasty as if pressed for time; this is especially a handicap as the dark wood floors show every particle of dust. The rest of the staff was very professional as experienced in most NH hotels. The breakfast was excellent, not giving a feeling of abundance, but of quality and good choice.

As for the room itself, well, it was small. The bed took up most of the room, but there was also a small desk right beneath the TV that you could have done a bit of work on I suppose. The bathroom was pretty small, but well equipped, with nice fixtures. Considering I was alone, it wasn't bad. You might get a bit sick of your travel partner if sharing, though. I had a room on the 5th floor, which I think is the top, looking out onto what I think was a skylight from the restaurant. Not much of a view, but it was more quiet than a room that looked out onto the street. But to be honest, I didn't really feel the street was crazy loud or anything, just a typical urban street. Cars only go in one direction around there, so there isn't a lot of honking. I would stay here again if I got a good rate. The wifi was free, and the service polite if not outstanding.

This NH hotel is very new (less than a year old) and it certainly had the feeling of a top notch hotel. The hotel and our room itself were impeccably clean. We had a room on the top floor (the 5th floor). It was very large with exposed wood beams. There was a ton of closet space for unpacking our clothes. The room looked out on a sort of courtyard so it was very quiet. The service from the cleaning staff is to be noted as our room was checked twice daily and was always in spotless condition. One issue we did have with our room was the hot water (or lack thereof). Showering between 8 and 9 proved challenging as we found there to be very little hotel water during this time (which is too bad as the shower was very nice). Perhaps because the hotel primarily serves business travelers too many people are showering at this time. The hotel needs to address this issue. Another issue with our room was that the towel warmer did not function. Perhaps a kink considering the newness of the hotel, but still something that needs to be fixed. The hotel has very good free high-speed wireless. The location of the hotel is absolutely fantastic for tourists. Nearly everything you want to see (e.g., Museo del Prado, Royal Palace, Plaza Mayor, etc...) is within walking distance. The metro in Madrid is also cheap and efficient and the \"Anton Martin\" metro stop is 200 meters from the hotel, so that too is an option for getting around. There are many good places to eat and shop near the hotel as well. We generally like to walk everywhere when we travel and the central location of this hotel definitely made that possible for us.
