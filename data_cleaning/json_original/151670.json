The pool was clean and opened early good way to begin the day. The ac worked well. Front desk satff were polite, helpful and bilingual. The hotel is very well located. We were right near the town square and Johnny's Boats. We did not eat at the restaurant wishing to explore the small town. The town square comes to life at night with vendors and food staff , do not miss the marlin from the kebob stand it was great and went very well with Medella beer. We did go out into the Phosphorescent Bay and were disappointed. I have been there before and saw little activity this visit though it was a clear still evening,I found the boat very crowded and the I guess diesel (?) smell from the boat was unpleasant. I didn;t rememeber this from past visits. It was very safe and enjoyable to walk around the town don't miss Moon's Bar very enjoyable stop for a drink and tapas- fresh, tasty and well served , great customer service. There isn't much in the town which makes it a nice low key stop in a tourist friendly area.

Parguera is a sleepy village and a favorite tourist spot for Puerto Ricans who come to see Phosphorescent Bay. The Villa P is a sleepy little hotel, too, except for on holiday nights when their night club is the hottest thing around. This are basic, clean rooms with plenty of hot water. The A/Cs have all been replaced with nice quiet units. The beds are a little old, but you can get a good night's sleep. Do not plan to eat at the hotel, especially breakfast. The food is fair at best and not good at worst. I don't understand why, in a place where fresh fruit grows year round, they serve awful canned fruit cocktail. Lots of carbs here; nothing like gravy on french fries, but that is apparently what the locals want.

Our room was fairly standard with two twin beds, satellite TV, Wi-Fi, good air conditioning, hot water, and a balcony with a table and some chairs. Our room was on the second floor overlooking the courtyard and the bay. The room was clean and everything worked. We really did not hear anyone in the other units or outside while we were sleeping\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the AC probably had something to do with that. The hotel is designed like a compound open to the bay. The hallway to the rooms is actually outside but has a roof. To get to the second floor you need to go up a few fairly steep steps to a landing that the doorways to two rooms share. We had some heavy luggage so it was awkward to maneuver it all up. They have a large dining room that has a full menu. The meals were included in our trip so I do not know the prices. For dinner, we joined an okay buffet dinner that was put on for a large group so we did not try anything from the menu. We did eat breakfast and they had everything you would expect in the US for breakfast and ours was good\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6maybe a little slow on the coffee refills. The hotel is right on a very beautiful bay with aqua and blue waters and lots of small islands. There is no beach or swimming access to the ocean, but there is a dock for boats to take you out on excursions. The courtyard is nicely landscaped with lots of flowers and places to sit and relax. The pool looked nice and there was a bar near the water. There were various vending machines available for snacks and drinks near the rooms. We walked around the area at night and felt safe enough but there must be some reason that they have a guard at the front door, a walled compound with razor wire on top, and lock the boat dock access at night.

Villa Parguera has a great view of a bay and is just too cute! But, you can't swim in the Caribbean there and there is no surf. The resort is mainly a refuge for natives, and seems odd to American taste. The setting and natural amenities are what makes the place attractive. The facility itself is OK, but you can't go much further. The semi-isolated location and hotel arrangement make this an excellent place for families with children. The pool is not heated, but has a neat waterfall on one end. The hotel is small, so there is no getting lost there. We were with a group of seniors, and enjoyed the outdoor sitting areas and small dock over the water as places to gather and talk. Night life there is limited to a couple of bars used mainly by locals, which was OK with us, but might disappoint a young crowd. There is a good reason most people rate this parador highly.

Parking within distance of the shoreline the locals said that this motel was the best choice so I went in to check it out. The price was around 70.00 and although the rooms were not fancy, they were very cozy and had everything one can need for a comfortable stay. The air conditioner was new with a remote control and there was a sliding glass door to a balcony on my second floor room. Food in the restaurant smelled delicious but dinners seemed a bit costly so I chose to eat in the plaza with all the tourists and the locals to save some cash. There was delicious food available cheap and the pinchos...shisk ka bobs with chicken, beef, shark, or shrimp in US style barbecue sauce were mouth watering for several dollars each and a meal in themselves. They are even served with a slice of fresh homemade bread! The motel gave me a free ticket to the live show and although geared up for an older crowd there were many younger folks there too and it lasted till after one A.M. IT WAS WONDERFUL!! There is a large, clean pool and a good sized multi-level deck with chaise lounges for sunning. They have a large fenced in parking lot that is guarded day and night and FREE. In the plaza where they sell all the food and mixed drinks they offer trips out into the lagoon to see the phosphorescent glow in the evenings as well as fishing trips. The people of the village were very friendly and even with all the drinking in the cantinas surrounding the main drag I witnessed no drunkenness or trouble. The motel was so enjoyable I stayed three nights. A short drive backtracking in the direction of Ponce is Guanica and the dwarf dry forest and around Guanica and the sea are secluded beaches where one can swim undisturbed.

First, the location -- a quaint seaside fisherman village of La Parguera. The town is peaceful during the week and fills up with local folks during the weekends. LaParguera is a great location for scuba diving, snorkeling, boating and kite-surfing to name a few. You can also take a tour of the bio-bay under a moonless night. We took a private tour with Ismael of Aleli Tours. $90 for 4 people. I recommend doing this, vs. taking the big ship tour, since all you can see on the big boat is someone from the crew jumping into the bay. With a small tour, you can get real close to the water and see the bioluminensce. We had an ocean front room. Great air conditioner, excellent balcony with table/chair and a view of the peaceful glass-like waters. TV with cable. The rooms are clean and nice. Nothing too fancy, but not shabby either. Lots of hot water and water pressure. The cleaning staff is a delight. I know that some of the staff have been working at this Parador for years and that is a great plus. The restaurant onsite serves very decent food all day. And great cafe con leche. The pool is very clean and nice, right next to the sea. You can get free wireless access from the lobby of the hotel - just ask the friendly and accomodating front desk. We recommend Johnny's Boats. You can get a great deal, including gas on a pontoon boat. We rented one for 3 hours for about $40, including gas and took it out to the mangroves for some great snorkeling. It's protected and gentle water -- safe for children with their parents. We ate many meals at the local bakery panaderia (it is mentioned positively in many reviews here), LUCERNA. The owner is extremely friendly and accomodating.. The sandwiches and bread are fresh, delicious and cheap!!! And the juices are wonderful. Coffee is excellent too. Please visit this bakery if you visit LaParguerua. The local folks are warm and friendly. We enjoyed many conversations with them in the small plaza nearby and at many of the businesses/ restaurants in town.

Overall, the hotel could really use a facelift. Paint is peeling in many areas, our room had a dank, moldy smell, and the layout of the room was a bit odd. If you are getting a room, I recommend a room that is closer to the pool/reception area because our room overlooked the water but also overlooked a huge, white, tin roof just below us. The pictures may be a bit deceiving...there is a nice pool here because you are not allowed to swim in the ocean water. The view of the water is nice, but it looks more like a lake than the Caribbean sea. The town is a little bit dead. Just a few blocks from the hotel, there are some bars and kiosks, but there were not that many people there (I don't know where the locals go?). This also could be because we came during a mid-week in June (off season). I don't think the hotel is worth the price. If you want to visit beaches or attractions, you need to drive at least 20 min to get somewhere. The receptionists are pleasant, but not overly helpful. Also, be aware that this facility has a function room for weddings/big events. When we were there, a huge crowd of people were there and it was not very conducive to a relaxing experience outside by the pool.
