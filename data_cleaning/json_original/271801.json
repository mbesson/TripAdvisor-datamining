I'm a Hilton chain fan, and don't think this Holiday Inn chain product is up to Hilton chain standards, but we had two rooms for five nights for just 50,000 Priority Club points (a Points Stretcher deal), which is hard to beat, considering that even Hampton Inn rooms in Phoenix in March run $175+. On the plus side, the hotel recently has been renovated, and rooms, while not fancy, are pleasant enough. There's plenty of free parking, and while this Crowne Plaza really isn't near anything it's just a half hour from nearly everything in the Valley. On the negative side, rooms have no fridge or microwave. You can rent a fridge for $10 a day -- c'mon, when was the last time you rented a fridge, unless you were staying at a $39 a night mom 'n pop!? This is ridiculous! Housekeeping also was hit and miss. Some days we got soap and washcloths, and other days we didn't. All of our three rooms (friends joined us for a couple of days) faced the interior pool, so there was no natural light. We had breakfast at the hotel ($7 to $11 each for the continental or full buffet ) a couple of days, and it was so-so. I did like the Starbucks kiosk -- Priority members get free coupons. The bar/lounge -- 99 Degrees -- is like something out of the 1950s. All in all, it could have been much worse, but it still has a long way to go to compete with other similar chain properties.

Crowne Plaza delivered on that score; and we got a nice rate via Hotwire. Rooms are arranged a very large atrium which includes an indoor pool. It didn't bother us at all, but guests who are sensitive to chlorine odors might find this a drawback. The hotel seemed nice but strangely empty of decor. I think we may have come while they were in the midst of a carpet cleaning of the main atrium--no furniture, no plants in the gravel, just wide open emptiness, which gave it a strange feel. The front desk staff were generally nice, but on check-on the clerk failed to notify us that there was a happy hour. We learned of it only after we were walking through the lobby and heard another staffer apologize to a guest that he was checking in too late to be a part of it. I wasn't sure if this was because we were Hotwire guests, or plain forgetfulness, but we were disappointed with that. If they had breakfast we didn't hear about that either! The indoor pool was bitterly cold--we had no problem coaxing my son out of it because he was turning blue. Hotel is in the midst of a corporate park area; there are some restaurants & shopping nearby (driving distance) but nothing you could walk to. The front desk staff have a list of local restaurants they will share. That's helpful. Cute gift shop in hotel, small but some worthwhile items.

I had the opportunity to spend two nights at the Crowne Plaza recently where I toured the facility in order to evaluate the property for a proposed event for my hobby group in 2014. My first impression was good, the hotel property is easily accessible from Interstate 17 just across from the Metro Center Mall. The exterior of the Crowne Plaza is bold-colored stucco, clean geometrical design with a nicely maintained parking lot. Parking was plentiful and convenient to any side of the building with a number of entrances and exits all under key control. The Lobby was large and inviting. Modern southwest decor greeted me as did a friendly desk clerk. Check in was a breeze and I was able to quickly make my way to a 3rd floor room overlooking the indoor pool at the entrance and overlooking the outdoor pool on the opposite balcony side. The room was a double/double, basically a standard sized hotel room. Take a look at the video I prepared detailing my tour of the hotel. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcgzsUiUBKQ&feature=youtube_gdata_player I had the opportunity to observe the hotel staff and I could not be more impressed. I have not seen this level of customer service demonstrated since staying at a much pricier 4 or 5 star hotel. My room came with a certificate for a drink from the Starbucks kiosk. The kiosk was staffed by the breakfast servers attending to the very fresh, well done breakfast buffet. The server-barista was pleasant, prompt, and provided me with a totally tasty latte. The staff was friendly without being 'forced', they made eye contact, and made you feel totally welcomed. The breakfast consisted of continental fare which was a selection of fresh fruit (whole and cut), rolls, danish, bagels, toast, yogurt, juice, water, coffee. You had the option of upgrading breakfast to the hot buffet which added a selection of breakfast meats, skillet potatoes, eggs, waffles, and fresh salsas. I opted for the upgrade and was not disappointed. The dishes were fresh, hot, and plentiful. The servers kept your coffee cup full and cleared the tables promptly. There were a large number of guests at the hotel as two college teams were in town for bowl/invitationals. The hotel was properly staffed to take care of the needs of large groups as well as the singles there for a quick bite before taking in events, shopping, and the sites of Phoenix. The hotel offers the best in resort offerings: indoor & outdoor pools, spa, fully equipped gym, lounge, restaurant, lovely grounds and great proximity to nightlife and shopping. The Crowne Plaza Phoenix North is a surprise in that it feels as if you were one of just a few guests in a bed & breakfast. I would highly recommend this property for couples, a girls weekend away, or a corporate or hobby event. I whole-heartedly recommended the Crowne Plaza to my group and hope to have a week long event there in the spring of 2014.

If something's not right or needs attention, they get it done for you very quickly. The bartender helps make lonely nights enjoyable and is a great entertainer. Saturday nights are very busy in the bar, otherwise you can get very quick service on any other night. The food does take a while, but it is worth it. The new chef is very good and I haven't had a bad item from the menu yet. If you want something really nice, Pappadeaux is a block away. If you need something healthy, there is a Sweet Tomato's and a Souper Salad within a two block radius. The Crowne Plaza on Peoria Avenue really makes my travels a lot more convenient, enjoyable, and less draining.

The lobby is beautiful, the pool areas are beautiful and the 99 Degree Lounge is youthful and modern and does a thriving business on weekend nights. The hotel is an excellent place to hold a conference or event. The event areas are spacious and well-kept. An event planner is available to assist with setting up the event and arranging for the catering. Despite the positive attributes, I have some reservations. The hotel was renovated in 2006 and whereas the lobby, conference rooms and pool areas are all colorful and updated; the renovation needed to extend to the bedrooms, which are more utilitarian than the lushness of the public rooms would lead you to expect. Additionally, the lobby area and the rooms surrounding the indoor pool are extremely humid. It is not that bad during the spring/fall/winter months, but it is dreadful in the summer. The pool also causes the lobby and public rooms to smell strongly of chlorine. Truth in advertising is always a desired quality when seeking a hotel in a city that you are not completely familiar with. However, the Crowne Plaza website is, shall we say, more enthusiastic about their property than is necessarily warranted. It is not what they say that is the problem; it is what they don\u2019t say. For example, the website raves about their restaurants, but does not tell you that the main restaurant, La Cocina is only open 6am-1pm and serves only breakfast & lunch. The bar/lounge, 99 Degrees serves dinner, but it is mainly pub food and is only open 4pm-10pm. There is a complimentary shuttle that is available for a 5-mile radius, but it only runs 7am-10pm and you are required to wait as long as it takes in order to use it. The closest golf course is outside of the 5-mile complimentary shuttle range and is only a 9-hole course and driving range.

The breakfast buffet was pleasant with choice of eggs, potatoes, waffles/pancakes, fruit, cereals, meats and pastries. The only downside was the coffee was the least to be desired. Luckily there is a coffee bar that serves Starbucks coffee. Our room was on the 3rd floor facing the indoor pool, which was a little noisy at night when putting our younger children to bed...noise lasted till about 10pm with late evening swimmers.

Once again, I should have known that many having reviewed this hotel, were slightly off the mark. I stayed at the Phoenix Crowne Plaza for one week for a business trip. I booked my room on Priceline.com for $33.00 a day. Let me repeat that folks...$33.00 a day!!! What a deal! Upon arriving, I was afraid I was going to be stuck in a double room. At 6'2, that isn't always the most comfortable situation. When I explained this to the front desk staff, she told me about renovations going on and not having many rooms. I was a little taken back because there were maybe 8 cars in the parking lot. I made nice with the clerk, smiled and what do you know, an upgraded room! Not that the clerk was initially nasty, but just needed some warming up with compliments, etc. After that, every person from the housekeeping staff, to the bartender to the concierge were amazing. Never a problem at all with the room. Decor: The outside looks as if it had been recently remodeled. New paint, and it looked pretty nice. Inside looked the same way. Very nice remodel. I walked to the conference center to take a look and more of the same. Very nice, clean and no problems. The bar was extremely clean, well kept and comfortable. There was an outdoor and indoor pool, neither of which I used, but they seemed to both be nice places to visit. The hallways of the interior section of the hotel seemed a little dingy. Not to say they weren't up to the standards of a 3 star hotel, but if I had to ding them on anything, I would have to put it with the hallways. Dark, carpets seemed a little worn and just something about the feel of them. Again, nothing to distract anyone from staying here. Room: I stayed in a King room. The bathroom was huge with nice shampoos and soaps. Nothing like a 5 star resort, but very acceptable for the 3 star rating. Towels weren't new, but they weren't ripped, torn or worn. The bedding was extremely comfortable and although I don't sleep well in hotels, it was better than I was expecting. The television was nice and inside of an armoire that pulled out. Not a lot of storage space if you are the type who likes to unpack into the furniture, but it was comfortable in the room. The a/c was freezing if you want it that way and the room was exceptionally clean. The room had a mini fridge and when I say mini, i mean mini. Tiny actually, but hey...I had a cooler and was fine. Also, I think the hotel advertises wireless internet everywhere, but this was not the case. Wireless is only available in the lobby and common areas. In the room, they will bring you a LAN cord, but the internet there is very slow, so don't expect DSL or cable speeds. It was acceptable for checking email though. Overall, this hotel was great. The only thing I didn't like was the area. I used to live in Phoenix and I'm amazed that this area has kind of went down the drain. The Metrocenter mall up the street is pretty dumpy, with only several restaurants available. Its not Scottsdale that's for sure. That being said, I had none of the problems with car break ins, or the such. I think this happens EVERYWHERE if you want my opinion.

The staff of the hotel was very friendly. They always made sure to say hello as we entered the hotel. The room was of average size and the bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows. The room d\u00e9cor seemed a bit dated and there were some signs of age. The bathroom was of average size with a decent shower and good water pressure. Complimentary soaps, lotions, and shampoos were replaced every day. They had a CD player and complimentary sleep CD, sleep mask, and ear plugs. There was a vanity mirror and hair dryer attached to the wall. The television had a decent selection of channels and movies to purchase. There was a nice work desk with a comfy leather chair. The grounds of the hotel were very aesthetically pleasing and clean. There was a nice outdoor pool area we did not use. We did order room service on two occasions. The food was very good, served quickly, and reasonably priced. There were plenty of parking spaces available. The hotel was located very close to a number of restaurants and a shopping mall across the highway. The AC worked great. There were some minor issues with my stay that prevent me from giving a 5 circle review. First, the hot tub was not hot, it was only very warm. The jets/bubbles in the hot tub very not very strong either. The ceilings in the hotel hallways and bathrooms were very low. I\u2019m very tall and a few more inches and I would have had to duck everywhere I walked. They did have a business center, but the internet stations were not free. You had to pay 35 cents a minute. That was disappointing considering that most hotels I\u2019ve stayed at have at least a few free internet stations. One of the phones in our room did not work and the door to the room did not close easily. A mini-fridge would have been nice. Tip: When you stay here you\u2019ll either get a room with a balcony inside facing the indoor pool or a balcony room facing the parking lot/street. The rooms facing outside may be quieter as you will not have to hear kids playing in the pool or smell the chlorine. However, the pool area was pretty empty and quiet the entire time I was there. I knew I wasn\u2019t staying at the Four Seasons, but I was getting a very good deal on a decent hotel.

The bad: It is a horrible hotel. We paid for an \"Executive Level\" room -- 4th floor -- the only other perks are a bathrobe (whoopee) and a mini-fridge. Within the first hour we had maintenance at the room 3 times. The mini-fridge had a 1\" hole in the center of the door where a lock had been. Maintenance fixed it by putting duct tape over the hole. Didn't cool. I insisted on a replacement. The shower did not drain. Not at all. Doesn't housekeeping ever notice this? The room was hot, thermostat showed 78 when we came in (3 pm on a Saturday, 100 degrees). I turned the dial to the lowest setting - 50 - to cool the room. One hour later it only read 77. I asked for another room, was shown 2 others, all of which were hot, didn't have mini-fridges and were on the inside corridor, not outside. I opted to stay where I was because: 1) The manager, Henry ?Nagle?, told me \"They are working on the air conditioning.\" 2) The inside pool was so heavily chlorinated it reeked. The smell did dissipate over the week I was there but it was nauseating for the weekend. Inside rooms had balconies that opened to the inside pool but were steamy (from the pool) and dark. Our hot room at least had an outside balcony. The halls and the elevator are NOT airconditioned below 80, due to the inside pool. This, in Phoenix, in August. You walk in from the outside 100+ heat to a lovely cool reception area, then through doors to a hot hallway, a hot elevator, and into a humid, warm room. Not nice. On Saturday night I found another maintenance man, complained about the hot room again, he told me \"Management wants it at this temperature, I can't change it.\" I found the manager again, he said, \"Oh no, not so, we are working on it, that's wrong.\" By Monday the room temp averaged about 74 even though we had it running constantly on \"Max Cool\" and dialed to 50. It stayed that way all week. Always warm and humid. Why didn't we move? We were there for a group meeting. And we heard MANY complaints about hot rooms on the east side of the hotel where we were. We figured we just had to put up with it, as we were lucky to have a room with an outside balcony HOWEVER.....on the following Saturday when we began packing to leave, the room got up to 78 again. On another floor I stopped by to see a friend, saw a housekeeper wiping the sweat off her face and asked her, \"Why is this hotel so hot?\" She ever so politely said, \"They are working on it.\" I had an inspiration -- I took a $20 bill out of my purse, held it up and asked her again, \"Why is this hotel so hot?\" She took the $20 and said, \"The manager insists on raising the temperature level every weekend. We hate it, it's horrible here on the weekends. And he knows the ducts on the east side don't work, he's known for months.\" The gift shop in the hotel doesn't take credit cards -- \"Management hasn't hooked us up yet.\" Me: How long have you been here?

No, we didn't sleep in the lobby or on the bar's pool table. Our non-smoking room was CLEAN, SPACIOUS and had NO ODORS. Thank God. Have to admit, I was nervous booking a hotel I'd never stayed at before but Hotwire did us right this time. And the fact that the bartender knew how to make a REAL cosmopolitan?! Nice. What I applaud this hotel for mostly though....and VALUE in any hotel......is STAFF. A big, fat 10 goes to the lobby and hospitality staff at the Crowne Plaza, Phoenix! Every hotel has its problems but what separates the average from the commendable is the willingness of its staff to make your stay, in the end, remembered as comfortable and pleasant. When the data port in our room wasn't working, within 10 minutes of our call, 2 service technicians arrived to fix it. When they couldn't, the hospitality staff invited us into their office where we were told to use their computer as long as we liked. We had come to Phoenix to house hunt so the internet was critical. Even though they were right in the middle of scheduling someone's wedding reception, they turned to us and said, \"No problem. Do you need the printer too?\" Sweet. We had booked a room overlooking the inside pool. Our mistake; nice pool.....big noise. We asked to change rooms for the second night and the desk clerk said, \"Let's upgrade that room for you.\" By now, I'm starting to think about writing a review for this place. What else? ATM in the lobby, fitness center, laundry, computer room and a cute little sleep pouch with a \"relaxation\" CD in it (obviously, for the sleep-challenged people in the pool rooms but, nonetheless, a nice touch.) Staff smiles abounded, house-keeping ladies did their job well and we looked forward to returning to the hotel after long days looking at pigeon infested houses! (Before you decide to move to Phoenix, do your homework. No matter what the real estate agents and residents say, (like \"WHAT PIGEONS?\"), this place has a problem.) I digressed. This is supposed to be about the hotel. Anyway....... Yes, stay at the Crowne Plaza. If comfort, hospitality and cleanliness matter, no disappointments here. When we visit Phoenix again (but NOT to buy a coop), we will certainly consider the Crowne! HAPPY TRAVELS!

They had overbooked the hotel...were asking guests to move to another property and then return to the CP the next day. They finally gave us a double bed room that was very substandard...smelly pillows, shower that dribbled water...noisy ac...and smelled like smoke (even though it was supposed to be non-smoking). The promise was they would move us to a \"king/non-smoking room the next day. After a long and frustrating conversation,the next morning, we ended up with a king/smoking room (only option available). They called our room later in the day and asked \"what are you doing in that room, you are not registered guests\". Finally was able to show them that we were registered and had switched rooms at their direction. As we were having guests over one afternoon, we asked to have our room cleaned by noon...it was finally cleaned at 3:30!! One of the most challenging stays we have ever had...anywhere. In their defense, they were extremely busy, but they certainly were \"over their heads\" and openly admitted it. I would avoid this property during the busy tourist season.", "Date": "March 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAn average Crowne Plaza\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1659065", "Content": "As a business traveler, I've stayed at many Crowne Plaza hotels. This particular hotel, while not bad, is certainly not the finest Crowne Plaza has to offer. The large atrium section is strangely devoid of any character, as if they haven't decided what motif to go with yet. Many of the large planters in the atrium are empty, and with the dark lighting it gives the hotel an impersonal, cavernous feel. Plus, the indoor pool is right in the center of the atrium, so forget about peace and quiet until about 9pm. The rooms themselves are okay, about the same as your average Holiday Inn. I would stay here as an alternative to a Holiday Inn or similar, but if you are looking for something nicer, I suggest one of the nearby Hiltons or Marriotts.", "Date": "February 17, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Crowne Plaza Phoenix", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d271801-Reviews-Crowne_Plaza_Phoenix-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "Price": "$90 - $135*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2532 W.
