The hotel is attached to Terminal 3 of the airport and is easily accessed on foot, with luggage. The property is gorgeous and clean, and the staff are friendly and attentive - as I came to expect of all service experiences in Singapore. My room was lovely, with a great view of the airport, and a glass wall bathroom complete with TV speakers that allowed me to watch a movie while I enjoyed the lavish bathtub. I was hoping to enjoy the swimming pool but it unfortunately closes a bit early (8pm I think), but it was beautiful just to look at. WiFi is available for the rooms, but is fairly expensive - however if you get a drink in the lobby bar you get access for free to their WiFi. My experience was exactly what I needed it to be after a week in Thailand and right before a 15 hour flight home - Comfortable, Clean and Friendly.

The hotel has a 5 star rating however when we checked in they downgraded the type of room we had paid for using the excuse they were heavily booked. I raised the issue with reception to no avail as we found out when we got into the rooms. Instead of providing 2 x twin rooms with twin double beds as booked and paid for they downgraded us to 2 small rooms with one bed and then tried to add a roll out bed. It was impossible to move the room with the additional bed. After complaining to housekeeping they organized their manager to look into the problem. I accepted 1 x twin room and I double room in the end. Paul the duty manager that finally assisted us confirmed that they were heavily booked hence the issue and conceded that it was not the customers problem but the hotels for overbooking.

Easy location if you have to stay at the airport overnight. You can hear the planes come in and out but considering you are in between two runways it's really quite quiet. For the price they charge it's over the top. This is the only hotel really close to the airport so the price is hiked as no airport competition for prices. Charging for the internet is a joke. $S35 for 24 hours connection is also daylight robbery, especially when you have paid so much for your stay already. Staff were really unhelpful when we complained about this. They suggested my heavily pregnant wife should walk into the terminal to find free wifi. The rooms are only hard wired too even if you do have to pay the over the top charge. I believe the lobby area is wifi connected but didn't cave in to paying. Would not look at this hotel again when we have an overnight stop in Singapore. Would probably stay in one of the hotels out of the airport and travel in given the price they charge and what you get for your money. We got a night at a better hotel on Orchard Road, all meals included, free stocked mini bar, limousine collection etc for less than this place charges for a room for one night at the start of our trip, plus the hotel on Orchard had helpful staff.

There are alternatives, notably a hotel inside the departure area where one can rent accommodations by the hour, if you don\u2019t mind the tiny monk-like cell and a nearly complete absence of accoutrements. That has its uses, as well. On the plus side Crowne Plaza rooms are spacious and comfortable, and it is very convenient to the Changi terminals. On the downs ide, on my recent stay, two of the electrical outlets reserved for guest use did not work, and the Ethernet cable needed for Internet access was broken on both ends, making it impossible for me to plug the cable into my laptop. I was not in the mood, following my 1 a.m. check in, to call maintenance or housekeeping. So I did without Internet for the night, meaning I could not Skype home to speak to my wife. Instead, I had to use my mobile \u2013 costly! Also, I was told upon check in that wireless was available in the \u201cpublic areas\u201d. However, descending to breakfast in the morning, I was told \u2013 upon asking\u2014that the restaurant (second floor) did not have wireless. Only the lobby did. So I decided to simply skip the breakfast buffet, which did not strike me as great or extensive, particularly for Asia, and simply have a coffee. When I got the bill, I was being charged S$8 for the coffee-- S$9.42, including tax, etc. I realize that these are Singapore dollars, and somewhat lower than USD. But I still found this outrageous, and declined to pay, particularly since I could not event access the Internet, which was a major goal in the first place. So later on (after I had a more reasonably priced breakfast elsewhere in the airport), I used the wireless in the lobby. Deal there, unless one had already logged in from one's room, which, as you see above, I could not do, is that one buys a drink, then gets comp Internet access. So I bought a coffee.

First impression is excellent, the lobby and reception areas are beautiful (you really have to remind yourself that your in an airport hotel). The walkways between rooms are open to the elements and the rooms themselves are great - lovely moder decor, spacious, comfy beds, huge bathroom with excellent shower, flat screen tv etc. We had a room facing onto the runways and had no problems with noise. We didnt eat in the hotel, nor did we get to use the pool (which looked very nice) due to the short amount of time we spent here but i'm sure that would have just added to the experience. This is a great hotel and worth paying the extra if your in transit just for the convenience of its location alone. If I had two or more days, I would definitely venture into Singapore itself as this is a bit far out but for the short time we had, this was ideal. The only negative (and reason i haven't given this place 5 stars) is that there is no free wifi!

For the past 2 years or so I have been staying 1-3 nights at the Crowne Plaza Changi (Airport) on each of my trips to the island nation. My last stay was from 26/1/12 to 29/1/12. I would like to share my experience of it with fellow travellers here. The CPC is located at Terminal 3 of the Singapore Internation Airport. That makes it a very convenient place to stay for traveller in transit for a few (1-4) days. It's makes checking in to the CPC on arrival and checking in for departure flight a breeze. The ambience of the whole place is one of quiet and relaxed pleasantness. The rooms are generously spacious well laid out and contemporarily furnished. It has a beautifully landscaped pool with a in-pool tropical palm treed garden. It's a great pool to spend a hot Singapore afternoon in be it for a leisurely dip or swim laps. It's principal restuarant The Azur serves lovely food with friendly staff service. Most importantly the CPC has fantastic staff team that is the backbone of its operation. They are not just polite but are friendly, engaging and endevour to develop a rapport with their guests. The guest relation team in their Club Lounge is like their A-Team in guests relation. The CPC staff hospitality is the single most important reason for my loyalty to it. The subway station (Singapore Mass Rapid Transit system) is directly below the hotel amd provide easy access to the main shopping district and all parts of Singapore. But if one does not want to wonder far for some light shopping there is a new shopping mall (completed end 2011) just one subway station away. It's call the Changi Point Mall. Also all the 3 terminals of the airport interlinked by unmanned light rails are good for very light shopping and food experiences. There are foodcourts (great for local tastes and MUST TRY), cafes and restuarants. In summary I have no reservation at all in recommending the Crowne Plaza Changi in Singapore to all who visit the island nation. Be it for business and or leisure.

The best approach, I thought to myself, was book a room at the Changi Airport hotel, a Crowne Plaza, to make life easy. No denying the location was very convenient, especially if you are flying out of Terminal 3 and can take advantage of the short walk from the hotel to the departure desks. Unfortunately, I was leaving from Terminal 1 and had to leave the hotel during the two early-morning hours when the SkyTrain from Terminal 3 to Terminals 2 and 1 does not run. Hmmm, one last taxi ride. The location of the Crown Plaza seems to me to be a mixed blessing - convenient but no real competition to keep the staff and management on their toes. We arrived on a typically hot and muggy afternoon and no one showed up to help with bags (indeed there was no signs of life in front of the hotel) until we had unloaded the taxi and were getting ready to schlep our stuff inside - then doormen appeared. Check in was very impersonal - unlike our experience at the Marina Bay Sands and the Hilton Kuala Lumpur. It felt unsatisfying - little eye contact or welcome though there was no check-in line. The hotel is dark throughout and to access your room you have to walk down open-to-the-weather (but covered) corridors so you are in and out of air conditioning. The room itself was fine - it looked out on Terminal 3 and the runway but sound insulation was fine and the room wasn't too noisy. Internet in the room is expensive and I don't believe there was free wireless in the lobby. I asked at the Concierge desk for a map of the airport and was told to walk over into the airport and find one. Another hmmm.... The restaurant (we wanted to eat early because we needed to get to bed early for a 4am check-out) we wanted to eat at wasn't open, despite info in the hotel guest book, for an hour after we planned to eat. When my wife mentioned that the hostess argued with her, even after my wife went back to the room and brought down the sheet listing hours in the guest book in our room. Yet another hmmm..... Then there was the Business Center where we went to print out our boarding passes. Down a dim hallway we went and got our business done-expensively. As we were leaving we saw a sign go up saying \"Closed. Check with Concierge Desk\". We were lucky we didn't arrive 15 minutes after we did, I can't imagine the Concierge Desk being helpful. So, it was the end of a long busy trip and the hotel was convenient for an early check-out but that was all the Crowne Plaza Changi had going for it.

If you transit in Singapore, Jetstar requires you to collect your bags and go through customs before catching the next flight. As I use a motorised wheelchair and did not want to risk missing my next flight, I decided to allow for an overnight at the Crown Plaza at Changi Airport and pay $20 for a meet and greet service. I am so glad I did. After suffering the trauma of having our flight delayed by Jetstar, being packed into deliberately uncomfortable seating and having to deal with needlessly contemptuous and unhelpful Jetstar staff, we were overjoyed to be met outside customs at T1 by the Crown Plaza concierge. He helped us with our bags and wheelchair equipment and contacted the hotel during our short walk and accessible Skytrain ride to the Hotel so that we were met at the entrance by a hotel reception officer. She had our keys and paperwork ready and walked us straight to our room without the need to go to reception. Our room was large and even with the rollaway bed for our son, my wheelchair had room to move. The bathroom was very accessible with the only drawback being a small step into the shower. As the trip and check-in took 10 minutes we had time at 11.00 pm for a light meal at the hotel\u2019s international restaurant. I had escargot, my son had wanton mee and my wife had bruchetta. The food was excellent and reasonable. There was a very inviting pool set in tropical surroundings in the hotel and the view from our room was of the airport and skyrail. The room was very quiet and the bed comfortable. In the morning we were assisted to T2 for our flight with Malaysian Airlines. MAS was very helpful and accommodated my disability without any problem.

After having looked at a lot of reviews and options in Singapore city itself, and looking at the maps and easy transport into the city, the idea of staying at an airport hotel, even with a family of 5, looked quite appealing. The prices was in line with other 4-5 star hotels and given we were in Singapore for only a few days, it made some sense and so we booked. We were very glad we did. The Crowne Plaza at Changi is one of the most modern and striking hotels I have stayed at (and I do travel a fair bit). Despite being a large chain, the CP does well in making it feel like you are in a small boutique hotel. The design of the rooms are very modern but comfortable. It doesn't feel like you are in some Starck inspired set where you don't want to sit on the bed. All the amenities are great and the floor to ceiling windows are fantastic. The windows must be triple glazed as one hears absolutely nothing from the airport or traffic outside. The pool was a hit with our kids, as it has a number of large square planters in it from which tall palms sway. it is quite a striking pool and lots of fun to swim around the 'islands'. We didn't eat at the hotel so I can't say anything about the food, but the plates of macaroons waiting for us in the room was a nice touch. The rooms are large and have some of the nicest bathrooms I have seen in any hotels (save some of the villas in Bali). Very large, bright and modern, with marble and granite along with lots of glass. IT is very easy and cheap to take a train into the city for shopping and dining, and in many ways a nice respite to return to the hotel afterwards. Overall, this was a great stay and not just for an airport hotel. The other airport hotel that comes close is the Hilton in Copenhagen. Both great examples of great hotel design which just happen to be conveniently attached to the terminals. If you're only at Changi for a layover, definitely stay, and even if you had some time in Singapore, it is worth a consideration over the more pricey 5 stars in the city", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cAmazing experience, brilliant location, comfortable stay.\u201d", "Author": "Rupalie", "ReviewID": "UR123246233", "Content": "This is a fabulous business hotel.

However almost invariably... dust in rooms at check-in, being told to where to sit at breakfast, an almost universal lack of English language skills among the housekeeping staff, plus the stale bread rolls and warm desserts - methinks possibly salvaged as leftovers from the lunch buffet - laid out at the club lounge's cocktail hour all serve to remind guests that standards are on a downward spiral here. There are some positives - the breakfast buffet is definitly worth getting up for although don't expect the food to be anything approaching hot unless you're tucking in before 7am and the beds are very comfortable.

Here is my special tip: In the basement of Terminal 3 (where the Crown Plaza is located) there is a fantastic Food Hawkers Center.

It is a really gorgeous hotel. I love the way the hall ways are open plan with water features and plants growing. The only thing you need to be careful with though is that when it rains (which it does a lot in Singapore, and when it does, it POURS) the walkways get very wet, and the hallways get VERY slippery, it would have been better to put tiles down that had some grip in the rain. The whole hotel is spotlessly clean and well maintained as well as aesthetically gorgeous. As we were only staying for one night, the convenience of the hotel couldn't have been any better. I had seen it said that they had a Singapore Airlines check in desk as well, so no queuing in the terminals with everyone else. After we arrived, I spoke to reception TWICE, telling the time my flight was and what time I would need to check in, double checking we would be able to use their check in service. I was promised I could do this. HOWEVER, when we went to check in in the morning at about 7.30amish, we were told we couldn't check in at the hotel as it doesn't open till 9am. Obviously I was really annoyed as in our timings for checking in, we hadn't accounted for having to go the terminal and check in and was now worried we would be late! Surely the staff should know what time the hotel check in service opens?? The rooms themselves are wonderful. Spacious, well designed, and very quiet. It does help to be on the far side of the hotel in terms of plane noise. On the way out we were on the far side and the plane noise was hardly noticeable. On the way back we were on the other side and it was noticeably noisier although it wasn't noisy enough for me to be bothered by it. The rooms are really clean, the beds are SOOOOOOO comfortable! Makes me want to change my mattress! The bathrooms are big with a massive walk in shower and separate bath. Plenty of towels and all things you might need for your stay. I really like the way there is a blind that you can put up or down in-between the bathroom and bedroom. It makes the whole place feel bigger and actually, it helped me keep an eye on my 2 year old son when I was getting ready! Just pull it down for complete privacy. Oh and in the bathroom they have a speaker so you can have the telly sound in there still if you want! The curtains were fantastic at blocking the light out so if you needed to catch up on some kip when it was light out, or didn't want the light to wake you up and needed a lie in, they worked a treat. You'd hardly know it was daylight outside! The telly was good, big, flat and on the wall, but there was NEVER anything on and in both rooms the remote didn't work properly to change channels so it was really frustrating. Luckily I had taken a portable dvd player for my son to keep him occupied on the journey cause the telly want' really worth it! There is an ipod dock in the room which is a nice touch. There is also an alarm clock, which is light sensitive, so when the lights go out it is blue so you can always see the time on it. You can turn off the sensitivity bit if you don't want the blue light next to your bed. The wifi was really expensive so I didn't pay for it. It should have been free quite frankly! On the way back once I got to my room, someone from reception rung me saying something about wanting to know what time I was checking out the next day as something was happening outside my room about 10am...I was on a call to England so didn't catch it all and said I would call them back in a minute. When I did, I was repeatedly told that no one had called me, even though I had called straight back. I phoned at three different times to find out what was happening near my room in the morning but people kept insisting nothing was happening and no one had rung me. So I left it. Then in the morning, 4 workmen appeared at my window painting the outside of the building and they were there for quite a while so I had to keep my curtains shut.! This was obviously why they phoned me, to warn me. The communication and knowledge of the staff seems to me to be their main downfall at this hotel. On the way back, I also had one of the staff, ring the bell and then just start walking in while I was getting out of bath to answer it! I was really annoyed at having someone just come into my room. I was told she had rung the bell and no one had answered which is why she came in, but really...she rung it and then just came in! I got up the minute the bell rung to answer the door, and by the time I got to the bathroom door with no clothes on, she was already coming in and halfway through the door! Needless to say, she was met with a frosty reception. Apparently she was coming to do a \"turndown service\" where they bring cookies and stuff, which is I suppose nice, but perhaps don't just walk in. That wasn't the only time that staff just tried to walk in on me and I didn't really appreciate it. They actually have a do not disturb light near the door, which I didn't realise till after. It is pretty hidden. But I Would suggest if you don't want people walking in to the room, put this light on! I had room service on the way back, and the food was excellent. On checking out on the way back, the receptionist asked me who I was flying with and what time my flight was and said no more. Thankfully the porter helping me with my bag asked the same questions 2 minutes later and then advised me to use their Singapore airlines check in service. Thank you kind man! So why had the woman on reception not told me the same thing?! Again their staff letting the side down unfortunately. Overall, I really enjoyed staying at this hotel and would definitely stay here again!! If you go into the airport itself, down to B2, there is a kiddies play place (called Sing something?) open from 11am till 11pm and we took my 2 year old son to play there and let off some steam before the long flight the next day. If you have young kids I would definitely advise going there!!

Fantastic modern decor in rooms, love the open window to the bathroom (with shade/blind for privacy) so you can lie in the bathtub and watch tv at the same time. Havent had a chance to try the spa as both times they have been booked but it looks lovely. Would highly recommend getting a club room as the club facitilies and food is fantastic - lots of lovely nibbles and drinks with a great view over the pool with free wifi. Stayed in a suite on my most recent visit in June 2011 and it was sensational - amazing walk in wardbrobe, two bathrooms, two tvs, bath and shower, complementary chocolates and access to the club and a huge lounge and bedroom area. Love being able to travel after being pampered at the crowne plaza.

The downside is obvious - it's at the airport, far away from town and with the potential for you to be laying awake the whole night listening to aircraft land and take off. The good news - Changi is one of the most entertaining airports in the world. So in terms of food options other than the hotel, there's lots at the airport. In the hotel itself, the breakfast was ok. Local food and international choices were quite large and beat any European or American buffet hands-down. The lounge area was good in terms of service and snacks. BUT the wifi did not connect easily for our mobile phones (iPhone and BB). Laptop was fine. Another piece of good news relates to the sound-proofing which was well done, so no disturbance from aircraft at all, in spite of my room facing the apron. Another nice thing - the room I had was big. Bigger than normal rooms in city airports. the bath tub was an old style one that was sitting on its own, not built \"into\" the wall/floor. The shower cubicle also had a rain shower. So all in all, #very nice. The bad news - well, the check-in staff apparently \"ignored\" or \"overruled\" a system warning showing that i was being assigned a room that was already occupied. Alarming?! Yes. Especially when I was lugging my bag up 7 floors, entering a room with someone already in (whole range of security concerns there) and then lugging all my stuff back down again to reception. #Fail. My question - why even allow an over-ride?? The apology card was signed by the Duty Manager, another one of whom met me and apologised personally. Lucky for them I didn't take them to task. I do know people however, who would have screamed and insisted on better service recovery than just an apology. Also, we were told at check-in that there's no wifi available in the rooms. We made a fuss and made a mental note to blame our travel agent...but in reality they DO have wifi available (payment required) in the rooms. So - do the staff not know? Just in case you are interested - taxis available at the lobby; they will call for one from the line waiting at the airport. So it's quite easy and you don't necessarily have to go to the airport to take a cab unless there are no cabs at the airport also, in which case...u get my drift.

Booking via the hotel website was easy and just like any other IHG Hotel from the chain. Rate was very reasonable, though full advance payment was required. We arrived around midnight stepping out from the plane at the hotel. Check-in was easy and quick. Common areas are rather polished and chic and a true surprise for a Crown Plaza. The elevator takes you up to your room and there comes a big surprise: you step outside again on an outdoor walkway to your room. I am definitely not a big fan of such hotel layouts and especially in a place like Singapore, matter of personal preferences I guess. The hotel room is obviously very nicely decorated and rather big actually! It has everything you would expect form a 4 stars room: desk and office chair, flat TV, enough storage space and nice big bathroom. While the bathroom is very stylish - it does have this transparent wall that certainly give it a nice light touch though it doesn't allow you to use the toilet without being observed which is not ideal! The hotel provides bathrobes and slippers though no free wifi. AC was efficient, though the quietest ever, and the room was perfectly clean just like the rest the hotel. Noise isolation was good: you would not hear any of the starting or landing airplanes. Sleeping comfort was above average but not outstanding. We did not take breakfast or use any of the hotel recreation facilities like the pool.

The room itself was very comfortable despite the unusual colour scheme & overpowering frangipani motif on the glass wall between the bathroom & the sleeping area. There is a large flat-screen tv on the wall opposite the bed but it's a bit far away for comfortable in-bed viewing. We were pleased to note a rain-shower rose as well as a detachable rail shower in the bathroom. Unfortunately, the grout around the shower needed attention as did the sliding door to the wardrobe, which was gouging a line in the plaster ceiling. Fortunately, the room was very well sound-proofed & we slept well. We didn't use any of the hotel's other facilities & our check-in & check-out were quite speedy. On our second stay, we were in Room 641, which was in better condition (re bathroom & wardrobe door) than 704 & had a view over part of the 'open inside' of the hotel. Unfortunately, the sound-proofing did not seem to be as efficient & there was some intrusive aircraft noise on occasions along with a noisy air conditioner. Fortunately, we were so tired that we managed to sleep reasonably well. On this occasion, we had breakfast included in our tariff & went down to \"Azure\" on the 2nd floor at 6.15am, where breakfast is served from 6.00am onwards, This was one of the better hotel breakfasts we've had with a great range of juice, cereals including hot oatmeal & bircher muesli, fruit, yogurt, hot food, toast & spreads. There was also an extensive offering of Asian food which we didn't examine in any detail.

As we were flying AirAsia (which means we had to exit the terminal to transfer to a different international flight) we couldn't use the transit hotel in Changi Airport, as the transit hotel is airside. At the time, we could not book a day stay from the Crowne Plaza website, so we phoned their main number (we used the UK main Crowne Plaza number, we did not phone the hotel direct) we got a special \"day rate\" that was more than reasonable. They let us check in early in the AM and check out an hour before our connecting flight. The hotel itself is extremely modern, clean and the staff were pleasant. After exiting the AirAsia terminal, we took a 2 minute tram ride to the other terminal and the hotel was right there. I think it was about 30 minutes between us exiting the plane, getting our luggage, clearing immigration and entering the hotel... Changi is very efficient! We had lunch in the hotel cafe then had a swim in the beautiful pool. We then had a shower and a nap before the flight. I don't know if I was so tired that I didn't care, or if it was the beds, but it was one of the best sleeps I had during our travels. The room was huge, the bathroom was clean and ultra-modern, there was coffee and tea available for free as well as a paid mini-bar if you're so inclined.

Sometimes as weary travellers on our way within hours, other times for a 3 or 4 day stay as we use it as a base to explore ever changing Singapore during the day returning in the afternoon to relax in the comfortable Club Lounge or by the resort style pool perched above the passenger arrivals and departures of SIA. This hotel \u2018just works\u2019! Finding your way to the hotel is easy, after Customs, look up, follow the signs to Crowne Plaza Hotel. You need to take the (free) SkyTrain from terminals 1 & 2 but just a short walk and elevator trip to the 5 Star covered walkway that connects the hotel to Terminal 3. We have never had to wait for our room to be made ready no matter what hour of the day, night or early AM morning we arrive. The grumpiest traveller is disarmed on arrival at reception with a genuine smile, eye contact and \u201cWelcome to / Welcome back to Crowne Plaza Changi Mr ----. Check-in is fast and efficient and Concierge staff are on hand to assist with baggage but happy to let the tired traveller who doesn\u2019t want to talk or engage in any way stumble off to their room with luggage in tow. Rooms are light, bright, comfortable, efficient and by Singapore standards and quite spacious with comfortable seating for 2 people in even the standard rooms. We have never had the need to call for the \u2018missing towel or bathmat\u2019 or ask for the \u2018leaking tap\u2019 to be fixed. We have never had to ask at 4 PM in the afternoon \u2018When will our room be made up?\u2019 Somehow it just happens through the day when we leave the room for 30 minutes. Rooms can overlook the far from unpleasant tropical greenery and flowering bougainvilleas of passenger arrivals and departures or for those who have not seen enough of the inside of an A380 or B747, the endless runway movements of SIA. Management is almost invisible with staff from Reception to House-keeping to Club Lounge efficiently going about their jobs with a smile, the time to acknowledge guests, with their own levels of authority, apparently without the need for constant management supervision. When we are staying for 24 hours or more we arrange the upgrade to the Club Lounge (I believe currently S$80.00++) which gives us breakfast, drinks and canap\u00e9s in the late afternoon, broadband access within the Club as well as coffee & tea and cool soft drinks and a comfortable place to \u2018flop\u2019 after a tiring day trying to buy everything that Singapore shopping has to offer. Eating breakfast in the Club Lounge at 7 AM Singapore time can often provide the entertainment of watching new arrivals from a different time zone taking a dip in the pool and ordering a cool beer to sip by the poolside. Staff in the lounge treat guests as welcome friends (also respect) rather than someone to be served and \u2018got quit of\u2019 as quickly as possible. The hotel also offers 2 upmarket restaurants and a bar which looks out on to a tropical greened outdoor area. From my observation the hotel is either 200% overbooked or the Singapore Nationals find the Chinese Restaurant up to their high standards. For the cost conscious traveller Terminal 3 offers a range of Food Court and restaurant offerings, McDonalds, a small supermarket, Watsons Chemist and if you are accident prone a Doctor and Dentist. Then there is always Terminals 1 & 2 to explore. If you are looking for a 2+ km walk after dinner SIA offers that also all in air-con comfort. If using the hotel as a base for a visit to Singapore the SMRT (Train) station is directly below the hotel. SMRT staff are generally on hand to assist new arrivals (at a City station you learn the hard way) to negotiate the ticket purchase and travel system that will deliver you directly to almost anywhere you want to go in Singapore. It may add 20 minutes to travel time than if you were staying in a city hotel but the cost for all SMRT travel for a 3 day stay in Singapore is more than offset by the saving in the S$40 return journey taxi fare to a city hotel. When you are ready to depart Singapore there is not that nagging worry \u2018What time do I need to leave for the airport? Will I get caught in traffic and miss the flight?\u2019 From the hotel to T3 Departures, about 60 seconds if you are in a hurry, 10 minutes to T1 & T2.

I stayed here, as many others, for a night as I had an early AM flight out of SIN T3. The fact that the hotel is connected directly to T3 makes life very easy but beware that the connecting door to T3 is closed late PM to early AM and you will need to use the main connection on the lobby floor to get to the escalators/elevators to go up one level and reach T3 departures. Also, the SkyTrain that connects T3-T1-T2 will also be closed during the wee hours of the night. There is a rather easy way to get to this CP from T2 by crossing the air conditioned underground walkway at the MRT station. Just follow the signs to the MRT and you will see the funky glass walkway. There are multiple information desks that are open round the clock in terminals if you need further assistance. These aside, the hotel itself is simply excellent! The rooms are of a good size and well kept.

It was subtle and did not bother me a bit at all, but if you're an extremely light sleeper, perhaps make a note in your reservation for a quite room. Overall, this hotel is worth considering even if you are staying to visit Singapore during the peak periods when hotel rates in town could be very high. If you do though, consider that the only way to make the stay economical enough to be worthwhile is by using the excellent, and very easy to use MRT system to get to the city as cab costs back and forth could mount up, specially with the ERP during peak use. The MRT could take you almost to anything a tourist want to do in Singapore quickly, economically and efficiently!", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSuperb location and surreal experience!\u201d", "Author": "Wtun", "ReviewID": "UR118039642", "Content": "Located right at the terminal 3 at Changi airport.

It was spacious which left me wondering why front of desk wasn't sure if they could provide 2 cribs for me as requested upon booking (service lacking here). They obliged when I rang to say the suite has plenty of room to accommodate them. For a start, the bedroom had a large dressing area off-side which we stuck one of the cribs in. The other was left in the living room. However I was not impressed that iit took an hour to get the cribs sent up. My kids were ready for a nap. While my toddler was put in our bed, I had to put my 10mo on the floor! The bathroom is huge. Did not use the bath but the rain shower was great. Bed was comfy and the block blinds ensured a quiet night. We hardly noticed the planes flying overhead.

It's perhaps a little odd that the public corridors are outside - so you get the Singapore heat for a few moments going to and from your room. But you also get some great airport views! Staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms: The rooms are comfortable, modern. quiet (airport noise is not a problem) and very well equipped. A newspaper is delivered each morning. My suite had a large living area (with its own separate wash-room) as well as a separate bedroom and a large bathroom. Meals: I booked a Club Room and had access to the club lounge. The lounge offered very nice evening drinks and canap\u00e9s between 5:30pm and 7:30pm. The lounge also offered a good buffet breakfast which included several hot items as well as cereals, fruit, pastries etc. Leaving Crowne Plaza Hotel Changi Airport: Check-out was a little slow with just 2 persons working the desks at 8:15am.

We were next to British/Aussie comedian Ross Noble at the check out desk and on his flight too so he obviously agrees! After reading tripadvisor I had a few concerns that were all squashed: 1) Finding the hotel The hotel was easy to find from Terminal 3. Collect your bags, walk through the customs gate, turn left and push your trolley for 400m and you're standing at the hotel check in desk! It is actually part of/joined on seamlessly to both the arrivals hall and departures hall of T3. Terminal 2 and 1 are so close ( virtually next to each other in a horseshoe shape) and are joined by a monorail in a couple of minutes. It's not like Heathrow where the terminals are all spread out. 2) Noise We had a road below us and were overlooking Terminal 2 and 1 as well as a clear view of the runway. My boy loved watching the planes and monorails too! We hardly noticed the noise of the planes due to very low noise and my wife is a very light sleeper! No other noise from other rooms or the corridor was noticed at all. 3) Eating dinner I thought we'd get ripped off by being limited to airport choices but they were all decently priced in the airport terminal. We ended up eating in the hotel restaurant which was a bit pricey but not too bad. Had great service and food. Breakfast the next morning was free and was amazing. On a par with a Hilton breakfast for the western food choices of hot, fruits, cereals, breads, muffins, danishes etc plus just as much Indonesian/Chinese/Malay hot and cold choices. Superb! 4) Air con Many places are not adjustable. This was adjustable which was a relief although we didn't manage to get a temperature just right. We woke up once too cold and once too hot but this was our own fault I guess. The bed was large and comfy. 5) Baby cot This was supplied as requested thankfully and was a comfy travel cot. 6) Cleanliness All clean and modern 7) Bath for baby Some places don't have them. This was big and there was also a separate rain shower Overall, a very good stay and for someone/ a family that just wants to get off the plane, eat, sleep and get on the plane again rather than bother with a half hour taxi from the airport one night and then back again the next morning, I can't recommend this place highly enough.

Being overlooked by the air traffic control tower was a bit surreal, but it is an airport hotel after all. I headed to the club lounge for snacks, drinks and free wifi. The service was really really friendly, although they could do with a sign outside to say it's the club lounge. I almost ended up in the spa by accident! But the food was tasty, and the gin was generous... I was also really pleased with my room - definitely a cut above your average airport hotel. And a cut above the last Crowne Plaza I stayed at (Newark airport I think - might have been JFK). This one felt more like an Intercon to me! I particularly liked the large luggage shelf under the TV - I wish they had these in other hotels too. The window to the bathroom seems to be a increasingly common feature in hotels these days.

Being a Priority Club member, I was provided with two free bottles of water and canap\u00e9s which was a nice touch. It is possible to close off all light to the room by using the blinds so daytime stays are provided for. The bed was very comfortable and they were trialling a sleep program that contained a lavender mist to spray on the pillows - lovely! Some people have mentioned the noise - I was on the 7th floor and one could barely discern the sound of planes at times, but it would only disturb the very lightest of sleepers, and couldn't hear any external sound when the TV was on. The breakfast provided a tasty and diverse selection which would easily dissuade you from eating food on your next flight. If your airline does serve good food, maybe save your money and miss the breakfast option. Room service was efficient and the food of good quality, but as with everything at the hotel, it was expensive. If you wish snacks for a cheap price, head to the NTUC Supermarket on level B2 at Terminal 3 instead. Upon checkout I was pleased to discover that one can check-in for Singapore Airlines and Silk Air flights at the hotel, which saved carrying my luggage over to Terminal 2. I also stayed at the Ambassador Transit Hotel at Terminal 3 a couple of weeks later and can make the following comparison. If price is everything, then stay at the Transit Hotel, if comfort is your primary goal, head to the Crowne.

Yes the planes made a dull sound you could hear as a whisper from room 830. Did that matter? Not in the least! I was hesitant after reading some so-so reviews of this hotel and given it was an airport hotel, would I find it an overly used dump? Instead my expectations were exceeded beyond measure and now I would stay at this property EVERY time I visit Singapore. First, the location. It is within a few minutes of ANY gate at ANY terminal of Changi, (Except the budget terminal, sorry folks but there is a shuttle from there to the main terminals sooo) thanks to the Sky Train. You don't leave the air conditioned comfort of the airport, which is a good thing since humidity is off the scale in SG, as is the temperature most days. The architecture reminds me of the Beijing Olympic stadium known as the Birds Nest. There is an artistic facade fronting the actual building. The lobby is very open and easy to access from the airport entrances (On 2 floors, no less). If the first surprise is the convenience of access, the second is the building hallway construction. I say it's a very green hotel, because all of the rooms are outdoor access facing. Once your elevator leaves the first two floors of the main areas, your in a steam bath until you reach that air conditioned guest room. The room was airy, spacious, and had a nice spacious marble bathroom with large stand up shower as well as a tub. The bathroom is 3/4 glassed in and has a white roll-down shade to create privacy from the bedroom view. I found the bed comfortable, the room easy to appreciate, and the floor to ceiling glassed wall facing the airport a stunning view. It was hypnotic watching small to supersized planes take off and land from your bed, then close the drapes and privacy is complete. The room was quiet. I said that the planes made a mere whisper. Aside from that, you could not hear your neighbors at all. The hotels 2nd floor restaurant Azur served a fine buffet breakfast. I was pleased with it's quality every morning. The hotel gym was large, had updated equipment, and a view of a 3rd floor garden. Also on the 3rd floor was the pool and Club lounge. The pool was a work of art. It had large planters spaced to create a maze you could float thru as the pool surrounded them. In between these mazes, strategic benches abounded with water jets against your back rest. There was also a separate area of water containment that the pool overflowed into which was the 2nd and 1st floor lobby skylight. You looked up and saw water overhead. That was nice. The club lounge was awesome. It featured comfort, spaciousness, was never crowded, and offered continental breakfast and nightly snacks. All of the staff were supremely helpful. including Rome, who was always on top of his game with Service. Thanks Rome for your consistent service! Another fantastic attribute was the SMRT, the SG metro that docked in the basement of the airport. From the lobby, you could be on a train to downtown or other areas served in less then 5 minutes, All areas were very accessible for handicapped and elevators were always in service. The 1st floor had a Chinese restaurant, which we ate in once, but with so many,many economical options for food in SG, we did not eat there again. My favorite local restaurant was actually an outdoor food court in Bedok, just past the left side of the main food areas, that had the best Mutton Curry rice around. At about 2$, the price was more than right, it was unreal. The beer as well there was without markup, as it was less than supermarket price. We found so many economical food outlets, but none had the simplicity and availability of this one. A word of caution; If your going to Sentosa island because you think it's still an island, don't bother. It's now more of an amusement park, and the beaches are shrunken, the crowds unreal, and there is a charge to walk there of 1 SGD (Please, why?) I was curious why the Merlion was so huge there and you had to pay to walk on the island and see it, when you could always see the one downtown, but lo and behold, some rich person built a hotel around the downtown Merlion and now you cannot see it at all, which is a shame as it was an attraction free to all. Plus the one in Sentosa doesn't squirt into the water like the downtown one used to. The entire stay at the Crowne Plaza was terrific. The only issue I had was so minor, it was ridiculous. I expected a nice cookie each night as a Platinum Member and didn't get one. Once I mentioned it to Rome in the Club Lounge, and asked if he could have them serve them the last two nights at turn down time, 5 cookies blasted my door down a few moments later and each of the remaining nights, I had my cookie. As I said, minor, but it was worth mentioning for the service comment :-) Checkout was painless, but there is a caveat to leaving SG before 6am. I had an early flight, and when I went to the Skytrain to terminal one from terminal three where the hotel was located, it was closed. A shuttle bus runs instead outside the nearest door. Be prepared, as everything else in Changi is huge, the shuttle bus is a micro-bus, which barely holds luggage. This is not a Hotel problem, but if they could pass onto the airport authority that the Shuttle Bus is a joke by being so small, maybe a large one could be offered. Summary - I have stayed in SG at the Stamford and the Mandarin, While they had location to downtown on their side, their properties are awful compared to the many and desirable things about the Crowne Plaza at Changi.

Other Trip Advisor reviews had been positive and we wanted a location close to the airport because of our itinerary. We arrived into Terminal 1 at 18.30 on 11 March, having flown overnight from the UK. The hotel is located adjacent to Terminal 3 and we loaded our 5 bags onto an airport trolley and headed for the Sky Train for the transfer. We had to ascend a level and lift facilities were busy so headed for an ascending travellator. This was a mistake because neither I nor the brake on the trolley could hold the weight of the luggage on the slope and a person behind us had to stop the travellator moving whilst we reversed back down and headed for the lift, battered and bruised. The airport shuttle between the terminals is quick and efficient. Alighting at T3, the entrance to the Crowne Plaza was just to the left and signposted. You enter the hotel on Level 2, where the restaurant is located, and take the lift to Level 1 for Reception. Check-in was quick and efficient and we were given room 624. According to the hotel concierge, airport luggage trolleys cannot be taken up to hotel rooms and our cases were transferred to a hotel trolley instead. Gaining access above Level 2 requires guests to place their key card over sensor in the lift and then select the floor level; this is a good security feature to prevent unauthorised access to the residential floors, although someone could still tail-gate a resident to gain access to the upper floors.. In our experience, this hotel is unique for a place of its kind because the corridors linking the rooms on each floor are open-sided, with a water feature running along at floor level. One downside of this is that there is no screening of exterior noise, primarily from aircraft. In fairness, room soundproofing is very good, particularly via the full-height windows. The air-conditioned room was of acceptable size for the nature of our stay. Let\u2019s be honest, this is a short-stay hotel, where most people have no requirement for a large living space. However, it was certainly larger than a great many hotels in either New York or London. The room was \u2018L\u2019 shaped. Entering through a heavy, secure door, there is a bag storage area, then a tea/coffee-making shelf with mini-bar underneath. Then there is a clothes-hanging rail and a long bench on which cases can be stowed. A large wall-mounted TV is fitted above this bench. At 90 degrees was a writing desk along the window. The bed was king-sized and with a firm mattress. The hotel offers a mattress topper to soften the bed, which we requested and we found no problems. There was a cupboard and light on each side of the bed, with a radio/CD player. The bathroom is fully glazed on the bedroom side, though with privacy blinds. There is a bath, separate rain shower cubicle, toilet and wash basin, the latter perched atop a long shelf. Beware of the sink tap! The water pressure is very fierce and the tap movement very short so it is too easy to get a strong jet of water that bounces out of the sink and wets the surrounding area. We found the room clean, well-appointed comfortable. Perhaps because it is a short-stay hotel, there were a few issues that needed housekeeping. A bedside lamp did not work, neither did the shaver point. The radio lacked an aerial and therefore also didn\u2019t work. Towels were only provided for one guest, not 2. Housekeeping attended to these deficiencies quickly, as well as adding the mattress topper. Level 3 has a large, heated outdoor swimming pool and seating area, a gym and executive lounge. Level 2 has a business centre, where the internet cost SGD15 for 15 minutes. Breakfast was included in our room rate, and we found a wide variety of hot and cold Western and Oriental cuisine. The evening buffet was expensive, so we ate elsewhere. We went off to Cambodia for 3 nights and left 3 bags with the concierge. On our return, we got room 410. Again, the radio needed an aerial, and there was only one bath robe. Despite having mentioned before our departure, the mattress topper again had to be asked for. Naturally, the hotel location is ideal for airport arrivals and departures. The Singapore MRT can also be accessed either by a covered walk from the hotel or via Terminal 2. If you need a tourist card, you need the ticket office, which is located at the T2 end of the MRT station but is only open from 12.00. If you just want a single-journey ticket, or want to top up your tourist card, it is quicker to leave the hotel, go down 2 levels and walk along under cover. The journey into Singapore centre takes about 20 minutes and involves one, cross-platform change of trains. The MRT system is a quick, clean, safe, cheap and convenient mode of transport. When we left the hotel for the last time, the hotel called us a metered taxi and the fare to the Singapore cruise terminal was SGD20.40, in line with other reports on Trip Advisor. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in Singapore, not only for its proximity to the airport, but also as a base to stay, in view of the ease of travel to downtown.

We booked on the hotel website at a very good rate and checked in around 10pm. It is a good walk through terminal 3, but with a cart, the trip is easy. The only disadvantage is that at the entrance to the hotel from the terminal, the carts have to be left and the lead in to reception is over a cobble stone type of tiled floor which while aesthetically pleasing is not good along which to roll suitcases. The room we had 718 is large, excellently laid out and stylish. On the very comfortable king size bed was a package called Enhanced Sleep Advantage inviting us to be part of a pilot program to provide you with quote \"provide you with all you (sic) sleep essentials for that perfect night's sleep\". How we wish that was true. The room overlooks the airport approach, the entrance door is off an open air corridor, and a long double glazed window of the large room blocked all traffic noise. However the noise of a landing 747 on full reverse thrust punctuated the night and ensured a completely disturbed night with little sleep for one of us at least. The next morning I sought the hotel Duty Manager and spoke with Alicia who assured me that our room, because of the cheap rate we had received, was definitely not one of their non preferred rooms. In fact she assured us that level 7 in our area is considered a quiet one. She was very courteous and apologetic and said that on our next stay she would try to ensure we got a quieter room in an area looking towards terminal 2. She also said that the hotel design concept was to make it more resort style, open air, rather than business like, which we could see easily walking around and which was very attractive. In our view however the design is great but that the hotel is not really suited for the purpose of sleeping in close proximity of an airport. KLIA and Suvarnabhumi got it right and it is extraordinary that high tech can do Singapore got it so wrong. Whomever commissioned and approved the design should take responsibility and take a night trying to sleep there. We felt later that the Enhanced Sleep Package was probably an attempt to improve the sleep quality of the room as a result of many similar experiences to ours. One of us would not go back and try a \u2018quieter\u2019 room as offered by Alicia as he cannot see how any of the rooms given the open corridor open air design and proximity to the runways will be able to offer a good nights sleep unless sleeping pills perhaps are included in the Enhanced Sleep Advantage package.

The rooms were beautiful with separate living room, bedroom, dressing room, bar area, a powder room and a full bath with large tub and separate shower. The toiletries and linens were really nice. The first time we stayed, we were provided a fruit basket and bottled water. The second time cookies and bottled water. The beds were extremely comfortable and the darkening shades kept most daylight out of the rooms. Our first stay was just overnight as we had accommodations on Orchard Road for 4 nights. The second stay was to allow us a break before flying back to Tokyo and then home to Atlanta.

We did receive a prompt reply by e-mail, but their investigation indicated that we requested the wake-up call for the wrong room. I think not! I hope the guest in that room got back to sleep.

There was a very comfortable seating area in our room, a large flat screen TV, a safety deposit box, tea coffee making facilities with different kinds of tea, a fridge. The swimming pool opened at 7am and we had a lovely swim there. Part of it is open and part of it has boxes of plants which you can swim around. I think it closed at either 6 or 7pm. There were restaurants in the hotel or you could walk back to the airport which is right next to the hotel. The hotel is excellent if you arrive in Singapore and are leaving next day. if you have longer you can easily travel by MRT into town.

And that noise went on for the rest of our stay. I don't consider myself a light sleeper but I had trouble falling asleep at night. Pros: - Convenience and location! We were able to check into our Singapore Air flight in the hotel, so we got our boarding passes early and even got exit row seats. Please note that the SIA counter is only open from 10-3. We were able to roll our huge amount of luggage straight from the hotel into the terminal on a trolley. - Club benefits. We upgraded to a club room and got access to the Club Lounge which served a continental breakfast (6:30 to 11am), snack and drinks all day, and cocktails and appetizers (5:30 to 7:30pm). We enjoyed the cocktails very much as they were mixed stronger than most bars in Singapore and the finger foods they served were so delicious we skipped dinner. They also had 2 computers with internet access. Club benefits included dry cleaning for 2 pieces of clothes, which came in handy because we had just gotten off a cruise with suits and dresses (they finished in about 2 hours too!). - Priority Club benefit. We got 4 bottles of free water and 2 very delicious cookies-- not a big deal, but still a nice touch. - One stop service. We could call to get any problems resolved quickly. - Bathroom. Great bathroom with a tub and rainshower. Nice toiletries from The White Company. Cons: - Aircraft noise. We had requested (a month in advance) and received a \"quiet\" room facing away from the runway. I suppose that there are really no \"quiet\" rooms due to the hotel's design. But I do have reservations with booking an airport hotel again. It wasn't just the continuous humming noise that bothered me, the hotel would rumble every once in a while too.

During Christmas Eve, I decided to stay at the Crown Plaza Hotel Changi Airport for a night with my mom. Each of us got a room. We were charged for the room days in advance and we were told to arrive after 2 pm to make sure our rooms were in place. We also requested a high floor and a view of the planes taking off, which we were told could be arranged. At 2 pm on the 24th of December 2010, when we arrived, only one out of the two booked rooms was ready for checking in. This was at 2.30 pm. We told the front desk clerk that this was unaccepted. That's when we noticed the room given to us was on the fifth floor. We had been told when we made payment, that our rooms would be the the seventh floor. So not only was our room not ready, what was promised to us was not give to us. They managed to get the details of our booking and confirmed that we had, indeed, made a request for the seventh floor booking. But the rooms were still not ready. So I told the manager that we would take a step back and go for lunch. It's time like this this you have to let go and be less demanding. We came back at 4pm that day and were finally checked in. The room was gorgeous. The view stunning. Yet when I tried to get my laptop to surf wirelessly, it turns out the wifi is unavailable in this room. I would have to use a cable provided. On top of that, I would have to pay $30 Singapore dollars to surf the net. This was unacceptable. I spoke to the duty manager named Nadia and she agreed that many of her guests had commented about this. But the management refuses to give complimentary internet service because internet service is not managed by them. What a ludicrous reason. I don't expect them to be an internet provider but surely they could give free internet if they wanted to. Finally, in view of our tardy check in, she decided that to waive off the internet connection cost. We shall see, since I haven't checked out yet as I am typing this. Breakfast: It's quite bad. My mother went down alone to have breakfast first and was given a lousy seat right in front of the restaurant, just beside the usher. The entire restaurant was free! But because those were \"4-seaters\" at the back, she wasn't allowed to have those tables. When I finally came down to the second floor to join her, I noticed how strange she looked. The entire restaurant was so bare yet she's there sitting right beside the usher. She also wasn't offered coffee when she sat down and had to ask if cofee was self service. I ordered french toast with the chef and it wasn't properly cooked. The toasts were not uniformly coated and they didn't taste good at all. I returned the remaining french toasts, had some fruits and left. Oh, the papaya tasted like garlic cause I think they used the very same knife to chop up garlic to slice the papaya. Ewwwwww. I know garlic is good for you but mixed with papaya, that's just gross! I wouldn't come back for this kind of sloppy \"hospitality\"even if they gave me free accommodations. Did you know that you don't get newspaper in the morning. No sir. It's not free unless you are a VIP and stay for more than 2 nights. Oh, and it's Christmas Day that we stay. What a wonderful way to spend Christmas. I was told we could check out at 4 pm today, but seriously, I would rather go back home than waste more time at this God-forsaken place.

It was such an easy trip and only took about 20-30 minutes. The swimming pool is lovely and we spent a pleasant hour or so relaxing there after our trip to the city. We had drinks and nibbles in the Club Lounge which commences at 5.30pm. There was a good selection, so much so, that we didn't need dinner that night. Next morning, after having a good breakfast in the Club Lounge, we wheeled our cases to check in at Terminal 3 and from there to immigration which only took a few minutes. Such an easy way to travel. In future, when travelling through Singapore, we have decided to spend the first two or three nights downtown as usual but spend the last night at the Crowne Plaze. We always take the early morning flight home and staying at this hotel the night before certainly take the stress out of flying.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County California", "Title": "\u201cExtemely Noisy - Caution/Beware!\u201d", "Author": "LeavingOrangeCounty", "ReviewID": "UR88089960", "Content": "Other reviewers must be deep sleepers because I don't get how they could rate this place so highly.

The hotel is connected directly to the airport arrivals hall (terminal 3) and reception is just 2 or 3 minutes walk (to your left) after clearing customs and immigration (it's also close to the train which transfers you to the other terminals). At reception we received probably the most enthusiastic and friendly welcome we have ever received anywhere in the world and were immediately upgraded to a suite which was something special. The suite was huge \u2026 with two TV\u2019s, two air conditioners (very cold until adjusted), separate bedroom and living areas \u2026 and a huge bathroom with vanity basin, hair dryer, scales (good for checking your overweight luggage), full size bath and separate shower recess plus the latest in \u201csee-through\u201d toilets. Should the bathroom be occupied, there was also a separate toilet room with basin. The bed was large and was a little on the firm side. The room was spotless, and whilst there was a small amount of noise from aircraft we didn't find it intrusive. There was no noise from adjoining rooms (although we could faintly hear people speaking as they passed by our door). There was no balcony or view from our window, but this was more than made up for by the very comfortable \"Club Lounge\" overlooking the pool and the large landscaped pool area. There were plenty of sun lounges \u2026 and we never saw more than 3 or 4 people using the area at the one time. The staff were most friendly and we found the service to be first class. The dedicated Club Lounge staff were always on hand to assist with enquiries, internet access, and to serve up free coffee etc. The free club lounge buffet breakfast was good and had a far greater selection than a normal continental breakfast. We stayed one and a half days and although it was a little on the expensive side, it was ideal for breaking a long journey and we considered it good value for money. If flying Singapore Airlines, you can check your luggage in at the hotel reception desk \u2026 but check the times as the hotel check-in closes at 3 or 4pm each day.

In essence, even things that are stated in the agreement may not necessarily be delivered, and they are not in the least apologetic about it. I had written in to complain but have yet to hear a response a week on... And counting... As for what is more relevant to travellers in Tripadvisor: Room was pretty good--clean and well-maintained (probably because they are relatively new). Service, however, left much to be desired. Lack of consistency was one of the gripes. Several of the guests to my wedding had also booked rooms to stay over after the wedding banquet. After the event, we realised that some rooms had bottled water provided, some had not. The same went for fruit baskets and the morning papers. We found it interesting that for my own room, I had none of those, except newspapers which were delivered on only one of the mornings. Housekeeping did a pretty good job of cleaning up the room, but strangely enough, they looked like they wanted nothing to do with the used tray and dishes from room service from our first day, which was left there till the time we ordered room service again just before we left, when the person delivering room service finally asked if they should clear the tray from the first day of our stay. In any case, room service is not recommended. Food is not fantastic but grossly over-priced. The eateries in the airport building serve food of the same quality at half, or even 25% of the price. Staff service was also inconsistent. Staff in the restaurant where we had breakfast were great. However, some others were not so. The most disappointing was when we were checking out, we were lugging quite a few bulky items from our wedding between the both of us. Along the way to the lobby we came across at least 3 members of staff. All said \"Hi\". None offered any assistance. One of the \"highlights\" was parking. We were issued with wrong parking tickets, a fact which was verified by the hotel staff. While they admitted that someone in the hotel had made a mistake, nobody was willing (or able, as they claimed) to help me, saying that I had to go back to the person who had issued me with the tickets to get replacements, as nobody else present in the entire hotel at that time was authorised to rectify the problem. Coincidentally, the person who had issued us with the wrong tickets had gone out of office after our wedding event. In the end, I had to pay for my own parking as everyone I had spoken with claimed to be unable to help. In summary, Singapore is small.

As my teens did not want to sleep with each other, one ended up with me. The other options were a $60-a-night rollaway or an extra $120 a night for a separate room. I was told that the majority of their rooms have KS beds, and that generally twin beds are not available, so be warned. Service otherwise was okay - bit slow on check-in and check-out, but okay. Noise level was okay - not much noise from outside despite overlooking the runway. There was more noise internally from the swimming pool and other guests along the corridors. Facilities in the rooms were reasonable, but there was no price list for the minibar so I didn't see that as an option. Drinks in the hotel lounge were seriously expensive, but for food at least you were a short walk into the terminal with various dining options in the public areas there.

I was pretty satisfied. Although it wasn't cheap, it was still cheaper than staying an extra night in the city. I requested a runway view and it was granted. The view was just amazing. It was cool seeing planes taking off and landing. Although the windows kept some noise from coming in, you could still hear a little bit of sound. It wasn't a very big issue though. The room was also pretty cool. The tub was interesting because of the design and the somewhat difficult use of the hot and cold water knobs. There was only two knobs. One was for turning the water on and the other for temperature. I'm just assuming that this is the new style. The service was pretty good as they were faster than the Conrad staff when calling people to come up to bring things. The check in staff was also very friendly. There was no free internet. Since the hotel was just a bridge away from Terminal 3, I decided to go to Wang's for lunch. From there, I went to the information counter to get an internet pass for free (6 hours). It's very convenient to use the internet for free if you're willing to walk to the terminal. The pool looked cool. From the top floor, I saw blocks of flowers and trees in the pool area. It wasn't just a normal square shaped pool. There were blocks of concrete in some parts of the pool with plants and trees. It looked cool to me, but it may making swimming less enjoyable. I believe there was also a fitness center, but I'm not so certain about it. There was a MRT station below the hotel and it takes approximately 30 minutes to get to the city.

I did try to book a stay here in March 2010 through the airport hotel reservations service but they didn\u2019t have any rooms available here. I tried again directly with the hotel and they didn\u2019t have any rooms in any category available. On both occasions when I stayed, I had an early flight from Singapore the next morning so it was highly convenient to be able to stay right at the airport, which is probably the main benefit in staying here. The hotel is definitely more like a four-star place than a truly luxurious five-star property. The fittings and furnishings definitely do not merit a five-star rating and, in any case, Crowne Plaza hotels are not generally seen as being five-stars in terms of quality, the rating only applying to the Intercontinental hotels within the same family of properties (Intercontinental Hotels Group). So, the tariff for this hotel seemed to be a little on the high side on both occasions and it would be possible to get better value-for-money at a more central location downtown. I booked the second stay through the airport hotel reservations service and although this resulted in a better room rate, I later discovered that the room stay did not qualify for any points credit towards my account with the Intercontinental Hotels Group. The hotel rooms, although they couldn\u2019t really be described as being luxurious, were more than acceptable, being clean and reasonably well thought-out. The rooms were not very spacious but still comfortable. There were a few interesting features not normally seen in most hotel rooms, such as a sofa located directly in front of the bed, facing the LCD TV, with a small round table directly in front of this sofa. The room just gave the impression of catering to a late-night traveller who would be more interested in convenience and wouldn\u2019t place a large emphasis on comfort or space. The furnishings used were quite middle-range but they were well-integrated to create a functional space. There was, however, an iPod dock for placing an iPod player, which was quite a convenient feature. The writing desk, for example, had the room safe located in one of the drawers which is not something commonly seen. The safe was definitely not large enough to house a normal-sized laptop but a small one could probably fit inside. The view from the bed and sofa would be one of a wooden plank behind the LCD TV and I'm just too sure about it, as it didn't seem to integrate very well with the rest of the room. The same could perhaps be said of the wooden slab behind the bed. The bathrooms were quite large and included a free-standing bathtub but, again, they were not truly luxurious by any means, with tiles being used on the floors and walls instead of the usual marble or other stones. The bathtub was basically medium-sized in width and depth and the bathroom fittings such as taps and showers were quite nice, as was the toilet. So, the rooms basically were in line with the business-market associated with the Crowne Plaza brand. No surprise, also, that the hotel has plenty in the way of meeting and events facilities, particularly for an airport hotel. I didn\u2019t really experience any issues with noise on either of my stays but I didn\u2019t stay next to the planes and was facing the expressway towards the airport during both stays. The soundproofing was quite good against any aircraft engine noise. I could sometimes hear the faint roar of the planes taking off but the sound was so dull so as not to be really noticeable and would definitely not disturb anyone\u2019s sleep. The views from the hotel room were really quite poor and were blocked by the unsightly steel structure which envelopes the entire hotel. It\u2019s supposed to make the hotel look quite unique and from the exterior, it probably gives the hotel a striking look but the views from basically all rooms would be obstructed and quite unsightly. The only service that I experienced at the hotel were the check-in and check-out and the respective counter staff. Both seemed ok on both occasions although the check-out during the first visit didn\u2019t seem like a very friendly experience. I never tried the room service because the hotel is located directly in Terminal 3 of the Singapore Changi Airport and the airport definitely does not lack in terms of dining outlets, even within the public areas. There is quite an extensive foodcourt located in the basement area of Terminal 3 of the airport, which is where I would go for more than acceptable fare. The airport also has a few more restaurant-like dining outlets and basically is quite an extensive shopping and dining destination in and of itself, which would go down as another strength of this hotel in terms of its location. The foodcourt in Terminal 3 is open till late at night but there are other food outlets and a foodcourt in Terminal 1 which are open 24 hours. Just a note regarding the Singapore Airlines flight check-in counter at the hotel where you can supposedly check-in directly at a desk located within the hotel\u2019s reception if you are catching a flight with Singapore Airlines, well that service is only available from late morning onwards so in my case, it was not useful as my flight departed early in the morning. In summary, this hotel is really quite comfortable and adequate as an airport hotel but it does not provide any true sense of luxury and considering the room tariff, you could easily do better in a downtown hotel in a more central location for the same rate. I actually think that if it weren't for the world-class airport on its doorstep, this hotel would perhaps receive quite a different evaluation from travellers. So, the convenience of staying at the airport would probably have to feature prominently on the wish-list of any traveller if they were to justify the cost of staying here.", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peterborough", "Title": "\u201ctop quality\u201d", "Author": "kenwade", "ReviewID": "UR60393119", "Content": "For an overnight stay or perhaps even longer this has to be one of the best hotels in Singapore for the money.

The rooms are also beautifully designed, with lots of glass and futuristic bathroom furniture. However, the nice design is not really practical. The combination of the water next to the corridors and the minimal lighting results in a potentially dangerous combination, acknowledged by the hotel, so they put fluorescent yellow tape at the edges of the corridors \u2013 does not go very well with the design. Also the nice design in the rooms is in general not practical with light coming in, splashing water on the floor, large doors difficult to move and a hidden safe. What amazes me most is that there was not more emphasis put on sound insulation when designing the hotel. Planes taking off and landing can be heard clearly. Was it too expensive to have better insulation, like many airport hotels have? Was the emphasis on the futuristic design and not on the practicalities? The front desk staff was neutral and did their job, bell boys were excellent and the staff in the club was very friendly and helpful.

First time I could not hear a hiss in my room. This time I probably heard one plain taking off. My door was facing the runway so obviously the doors are the weakest point. It the reviews complaining the noise are about the noise one can hears in the open air corridors of the hotel that I can understand. Crowne Plaza is the best airport hotel where I have ever stayed in \u2013 and is as well one of the best hotels in Singapore. Location Next to Terminal 3 and right next to the Skytrain Crowne Plaza is ideally located which ever terminal (T1, T2 or T3) you arrive in or leave from. Skytrain whisks you between terminals in a matter of minutes. Hotel building The building is architecturally interesting but at the same time very well functioning. There are nine floors and once you exit the elevator you are in an open air corridor. Rooms are in \u201cshafts\u201d rising from the pool level (level 3). In one shaft there are two or more rooms. The shafts are linked to each other by these open air corridors or bridges. The external cladding is interesting as well: a mesh surrounding the building resembles either twisted propellers of frangipani flowers which eve way you want to look at them. During daylight hours the mesh reflects shadows in your room making it an interesting play of lights and shadows inside the room. The first time I stayed in Crowne Plaza the building had just been opened and already then I wondered how the external mesh could withstand the tropical heat and humidity. A year later and it can be seen that it doesn\u2019t do it well. Some of the flower petals have already been broken and instead of brilliant white some are already growing moss. However this has nothing to do with the hotel interior or the service. Room I booked an Executive Club Room but was upgraded to a Suite room (as a courtesy to a returning customer). The room was huge: big living room, bed room with a walk in closet and a huge bathroom. In standard rooms the trick is the glass bathroom with frangipani flowers covering it. Suite room was much more saddle but equally interesting. All walls were covered with light wood panels giving the room both Scandinavian (and I\u2019m not talking about Ikea here) and modernized 50\u2019s look and feel. In Suite room the trick was how the designed had played with mirrors. When you closed the sliding doors between living room and bedroom, and if you did not know, it was hard to tell that there are more rooms. The same applies to the sliding door between bed room and bathroom. Pool Even though the swimming pool is rather shallow it\u2019s one of the most interesting pools I have seen. You can swim between the huge planters housing palm trees. Now that the palm trees and other plants have grown it\u2019s like swimming in a jungle river. There are two whirl pools between the planters \u2013 yet again finding those is obviously a planned trick. From pool level you can see down to the lobby level through glass bottom \u201cwater feature\u201d extending the whole length of the pool. As a summary: Crowne Plaza Changi is the best airport hotel I have ever stayed at. And definitely more interesting as a building than an average hotel anywhere. I have stayed in at numerous Singapore hotels and I have not yet found one that matches Crowne Plaza. The MRT is located under the hotel hence the city it\u2019s within easy access as well.

But then Changi Airport Terminal 3 is no ordinary building, it is Singapore\u2019s newest and greenest addition to this huge people processing facility. This terminal is home to Singapore Airlines new A380 fleet, and the Crowne Plaza is designed to the similar high standards as set by these most modern of airplanes. Whilst we had read that the Hotel was within easy walking distance from the arrivals hall, being unfamiliar with Changi airport and the relationship of the three terminals, we ended up catching a taxi. Almost as soon as we left the rank from Terminal 1 we could see our hotel, however we almost had to leave the airport grounds before the driver could turn around to take us back to Terminal 3 and the Crowne Plaza Hotel. We discovered later that free monorail trains regularly connect all three terminals every few minutes (for most of the day), and the Crowne Plaza is only a few minutes walk from the terminal 3 station. We arrived early morning during the Xmas rush, so unfortunately an early check in wasn\u2019t possible, however for a fee of about AUD$65 we purchased a club upgrade which gave us access to a very comfortable lounge and allowed us to eat some breakfast and relax in style until our room was available. The rooms are spacious with all the latest inclusions such as flat screen TV, ipod docking station, wifi broadband connection, and large ensuite. Despite the Hotels proximity to the airport runways, we didn\u2019t find the noise of landing aircraft to be too intrusive during the night; the rooms seem to be fairly well sound proofed. Our room didn\u2019t face directly onto the runway however as some do, so I cannot comment on performance of those rooms but expect that all efforts would have been made to minimise noise intrusion in such a location. Terminal 3 has a wide selection of shops, a food court and MRT station all readily accessible from the Hotel. The Crowne Plaza also has several restaurants and a bar. We only tried the main restaurant for buffet breakfast due to our short stay, however it had a huge range of both Western and Asian foods on offer, again as good as you could expect in any Resort Hotel.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mill Creek, Washington", "Title": "\u201cVery clean but service is lacking\u201d", "Author": "Swimmy128", "ReviewID": "UR53239009", "Content": "This is a very modern hotel with a great swimming pool.

The checking in procedure could not have been easier and we were given a room on the top floor (9th). The room itself was very modern and clean with a lovely en suite bathroom with bath and shower. The bed was comfortable and the room came with adequate wardrobe space, a 32 inch wall mounted LCD television and safety deposit box. Overall it was of a very high standard.

It is essentially in the airport, although I don't think I heard a single plane once I'd stepped through the door, even in the outdoor sections. Free access from all the terminals on the 'skytrain' places you just outside the second floor of the lobby. From here I was met and relieved of my bags, checked in and taken to my room. The whole process took about a minute. The room (I would have chosen the cheapest) was spacious with many lighting options, floor to ceiling windows down one side, uplights, downlights, spotlights, etc. etc. The shower was great - huge rain head and another 'ordinary' head on a tube; separate freestanding bath. Stereo with ipod dock, big tv and a room safe. Comfy king size bed. The internet comes via ethernet cable - front desk draw. If you sign up through the webpage presented it was $29 plus admin fees $3, tax $2. It turns out, despite the website claiming otherwise, that there is free wifi in the lobby and it's a big lobby with drinks service / bar and a wide variety of seats / settings. It looks like you should be able to use your room number, but the waitress simply brought me a 24 hour password when I asked about it. There is good provision for business admin services. I had to use the printer and fax -no trouble at all, although it did cost ($8.20). The pool is pretty awesome. The corridors on the floors above the lobby have spaces on each side where you can look down onto the pools and gardens, except the 3rd floor, where they are surrounded by water. The pool is a continuation of this and has palm trees and shrubs in pots throughout the pool. It's really unusual, looks great and breaks it up well. There's also an area of open water for lengths. Next to the pool is an area where the water flows onto the glass roof of the lobby below, pretty neat. The one thing that made me come on here and write this review was the service. Every single member of staff I spoke to (and there are a lot around) appeared happy to talk to me and to want to do all they could to help me out. That makes a big difference. The extras of good service too - storing bags for free during the day (7pm flight), allowing free use of leisure facilities after checkout, attentive waitresses/ers etc. Being at an airport, they clearly have a few customers in my situation and have ensured that they can provide for this with ease.

After having arrived at the T3 ( a new terminal ) we found our way fast to the hotel via a tunnel which was just beside the Skytrain station and well signed with a large Crowne Plaza logo on it. The tunnel itself was well designed and gave the impression you would look on both sides over a City Skyline as well! We came out on the first floor and had taken the escalator downstairs where we found the massive and modern entrance plus our destination the Lobby Bar and Lounge which was superbly modern furnished with extremely long tables and large lounge chairs on offer for a really relaxing environment and for people who want smaller and more intimate spaces and furniture this was also freely available in the large modern space which opens up via large floor to ceiling windows into a garden environment which we found superb and relaxing as well. In fact the garden and the hotel was so nice designed that we have taken many photos of the hotel as remembrance to stay here in the future as well! Please! We had a young and friendly waitress here who served us well with an efficient and friendly flavour of this hotel. We enjoyed incl. the Rule 240 mocktail plus a Safety Pilot mocktail and we had each one mango passion dessert with mango fruit and creme to eat. The bill came in an upscale 63 Singapore Dollars incl. tax and service, Folks! Well worth it considering the fine and modern surroundings of this eye-catcher of a hotel! We will not forget the Crowne Plaza Singapore-Changi Airport in Terminal 3 and had a wonderful hour here of relaxation before it was back with the Skytrain to our flight which departed from Terminal 1 on time to Kuala Lumpur with Air Asia! We shall return to Singapore for our third time hopefully in the future and see even more of this fantastic Lion City! So do not forget FLY!STAY!EXPLORE!

MY stay at Crowne Plaza Hotel in Changi International Airport's (CIA) Terminal 3 was really nice and relaxing. This place has an ambience of peace and tranquility enhanced by the Balinese style fountains, water features and shocking red Anthurum flowers along the corridors to the rooms. The Fitness Center and 30m long swimming pool with lap and resort pool features is just splendid, and perfect for relaxation or a serious work out. All modern exercise machines in the Gym will get your muscles toned and trim. Lush foliage including yam plants with gigantic arrow head leaves makes you feel like you are in a tropical rainforest. It reminded me of the lush Brunei jungle, familier to many who went there during National Service for jungle training. Right next to the pool is the posh Club Lounge where complimentary canapes and cocktails are served in the evening, and also breakfast too. Try the Spa too for a massage or perhaps lavender skin scrub treatment. Being The Travelling Gourmet, I have to confess that I love the Azur restaurant with its azure coloured rectangular tiles on the pillars and on the walls of the 2 show kitchens. Cheerful Executive Chef Eric Neo's lunch and dinner buffet of local and international cuisine in Azur is excellent, with even live prawns served in true blue Cantonese \"Drunken\" style intoxicated with Brandy. Chef Eric is also the manager of Singapore's culinary team for international epicurean competitions. Needless to say, fresh oysters and crayfish are but some of the yummy goodies to taste for your hors\u2019 d\u2019oeuvres. There is also a pasta station and daily carvery item of roast beef with all the trimmings for example. With the sweet treats of fresh fruits, mini macarons and French pastries there is Haagen-Dazs ice cream with yum yum toppings! Rooms are spacious with a see through glass wall between the bathroom, bathtub and the bedroom, a feature that must surely be a hit with those of a romantic inclination! If you arrive in Singapore and are staying in this hotel, their Concierge has a special pass to meet and greet you INSIDE the airport and bring you straight through in to the hotel like a VIP. Also there is great shopping with NO GST in the Terminal 3 shops just a hop, skip and jump away. I like Candy Empire where there is everything to satisfy those with a sweet tooth.

Basically just want a place to sleep before my flight early next morning. Arriving The hotel is conveniently connected to Terminal 3 via a covered walkway. Can basically push the baggage trolley directly to the hotel reception area after clearing immiration and customs. Check-in wasn't very fast with a bit of waiting because I asked for a quiet room. I was assigned to a room away from the runway since I asked for a quiet room. The Room First thing first, this hotel is more like a 4star than a 5-star. The room quality and furnishing reflects that. It's more IKEA style than luxurious. The decorative panels uses cheap wood. The flooring in the bathroom are tiles instead of marble. The glass panel walls on the bathroom has a cheesy orchid pattern on it. Regardless, the room is clean and functional. There's a bed, a good size working desk with ample power plugs to charge your stuff, LCD TV on the wall, a nice soaking tub ( but a bit small ), and rainforest shower with good water pressure. The room design adopts a open concept bathroom and you can \"see thru\" from the room to the bathroom. Privacy blinds are available in the bathroom if needed. An iPod station is conveniently provided for guests to hook up their iPods. The room does comes with some annoying aspects. The light switches are hidden and there are many. There's no master switch to just turn off every light in the room. Lights have to be turned off individually and some of the switches are well hidden. There's no closet or cupboard, only a small area to hang your jacket. The airconditioning was very cold, blowing near freezing air directly into the bed and the provided thermostat was useless. In the end, I just switched it off. Probably a technician from the hotel could have fixed the problem but it was late at night so I didn't bother to call. It doesn't get too warm at night anyway. The bed mattress is quite hard and not exactly comfortable for me. No complimentary mineral water provided at all. The only bottle of water provided in the room cost a ridiculous S$12/= a bottle. Fortunately, I took a few bottles from the airplane before I disembarked. For the room rate this hotel charges, it's kind of stingy. The view looking out to the changi airport tower was quite nice but due to the wierd design facade of the hotel, it was covered in metal grids. So it's as good as no view. Service I didn't ask for any service since it's only a one night transit. So can't comment much. There doesn't seem to be much staff at the hotel anyway. There are some cutting corners going on. Door key was just a card, without even a key holder which is the usual practise. When I checked out, the bill was given to me stapled instead of in an envelope which is the usual practice, a first for me. I had to request one. Perhaps the hotel is trying to save on envelopes? Conclusion For the price I paid at S$250/= just to stay one night, on hindsight, it's a lot to pay for the convenience and not a very good value. Perhaps a short 20 mins taxi ride to Marina bay will have landed me at a better hotel with better rooms at similar room rates. Overall, as a transit hotel, the crown Plaza Changi does delivers the basics, which is a good shower and a good night sleep but just don't expect much.", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "singapore", "Title": "\u201cLove It!\u201d", "Author": "mum2004", "ReviewID": "UR27790156", "Content": "Great room at a greater price!

For instance the spill over from the pool goes onto a clear perspex chanel that is actually part of the roof of the foyer!

Each staff member we dealt with seemed not only eager to please but thrilled to be working at the hotel. Their enthusiasm and professionalism is to be commended and I hope the management of the hotel realise this important asset in them. Our room was facing Terminal 1 and was very quiet. Outside the room, the sound of aircraft was inescapably obvious but inside was very quiet. The corridors of the hotel, on the accommodation levels, are open to the air to give a feeling of openness. An abundant number of plants have been planted to provide a bit of a lush feel to some areas. Separate shower and bath. Both huge and the shower was just exceptional. The only real down point of our stay was an outrageous price I paid for a coffee in the ground floor lounge ($9). Admittedly, I did not ask how much a coffee would be, but there was a sign saying take away coffee was about $5. That said, a couple of minutes walking and you can be any number of coffee shops or food vendors in the airport. Basement 2 of Terminal 3 has a great food hall) and free wireless internet. About 35 minutes from Changi Airport MRT to City Hall MRT, so the hotel isn\u2019t the best option if you plan to spend all your time exploring the city (but the train is excellent.

The services is incredible, and I would definitely stay here again. I stayed at this hotel while on an overnight stop in Singapore, in transit to Thailand. The hotel staff were extremely welcoming, and the hotel decor and architecture is so amazing that you will feel like you are about to enter an art exhibit. The room was very new, clean, and quite lovely, but the bed was not comfortable at all! I stayed overnight on two occasions and the bed I slept in during my first stay seemed to be more comfortable than my second stay, but maybe it seemed that way because I was staying after a longer flight duration. On the second stay I tossed and turned all night. The air conditioning vent was also right about my head, so I had a constant flow of cold air blowing on me which wasn't too comfortable. This did not happen during my initial stay. During my first stay the bed was on the right side of the room, and during my second stay it was on the left side of the room 311. I think the air vents might be on the left side, which is why I could feel the air flow during my stay. However, the room was very pleasant to be in, and so I only left the room to stop for a bagel at the coffee shop within the airport terminal. I did not have breakfast or dine at the hotel as I thought the prices were quite high. I did purchase water from the mini bar at $12 Singapore dollars per (small) bottle. Overall I would say this is probably one of the best hotels I've stayed in and I am extremely fussy! Perhaps not the most convenient if you want to stay downtown and local to all the attractions that Singapore has to offer. A taxi into town was around $25-30 Singapore dollars. Note that if you have an early flight i.e. before 7 am, you will not be able to use the free Sky Train to your terminal. Instead you will have to take a taxi, which costs approximately $10 Singapore dollars. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Its luxurious, clean, very well designed, and the staff are wonderful. I was even allowed to check my bags for my connecting flight at this hotel.

I stay about 30 to 60 days a year in hotels, so I know that this isn't a common hotel check-in and check-out time - *BUT* I expected a hotel *WITHIN* the airport to be more understanding. We arrived at 1am, very tired, and were told that our pre-paid reservation was for the upcoming day, and that we couldn't check-in for another 10 hours! Finally, the girl (Jamie) at the check-in counter agreed to let us check-in but charge us an extra $100 on-top of our already paid room! This is ridiculous! I expected more from an \"airport\" hotel! All we wanted was to have a place to sleep during our short stay. We ended up being FORCED to pay for 1 and 1/2 days worth, when we got only 1/2 day worth. Internet was supposedly included, but it showed just 1 bar! -- I was unable to access anything. The WiFi page that loaded asked me to call some 1800 #, etc. but I didn't bother. If it's that difficult to access the Internet (something that should be as standard as running water), then I don't have time to waste. The hotel amenities showed that a \"business center\" is available. I decided to go there to access the Internet. I was charged $0.80 PER MINUTE to use (slow) Internet at this business center. And another thing that annoyed me profusely was the $12 tag on a bottle of water in the room. $12 for a bottle of plain water! In the hotel \"feedback\" form, I wrote: \"I would have been happier with a TV 2\" smaller, if it allowed you to afford a bottle of water. In fact, I would have been happy if you didn't insult me with a $12 price-tag on the water bottle and raised the room-rate by $12\". This hotel is either very low on cash, or they expect to charge one of the highest rates in Singapore and STILL rip people off. The whole idea behind charging more for room rates is that there are more amenities and services included. I've stayed at hotels for half the price that offer free bottled water, free no-hassle WiFi, free breakfast, and even bell-boys to handle your luggage. Don't get me wrong. The hotel is magnificent - furnished beyond expectations and with great views.

The subway is right below the hotel and it took 45 minutes and 1 subway change to get to the middle of Orchard road. MUCH cheaper than a taxi.

WHOOPS. I even asked the driver if this taxi ride would be more expensive than a regular one and he said no. That cost him a tip!

Fluffy pillows and quilts helped in giving us a restful sleep ahead of the 15 hour flight awaiting us next day. There is a large bathroom with shuttered windows and excellent powerful showers in a separate stall. In addition there is an extra toilet which is really very useful when traveling with kids. Toiletries are top notch quality ones. I marveled at the architecture of the hotel and in many open areas of the walkways between rooms, the structure allowed gusts of air to blow. As mentioned in an earlier review, I would really not mind staying here for a longer period too as transport is not an issue and the terminal buildings have a wide choice of food options- far better than the hotel and at a fraction of the price.

This is a great airport hotel. With Singapore being so central to everywhere we decided to break our journey on route to Vietnam (there were no direct flights for us) so we stayed one night here. We were in a suite again but, unlike last time, there was no one to greet us at the airport luggage carousel. We kept our eyes peeled but alas... our surnames weren't in sight this time. This may have been due to the fact that the price we paid was a lot less than the first time we stayed here. Either way, the hotel is a short and easy walk from the terminal we arrived in. The hotel is next to the runway - it may even be wedged between two runways. We think this all adds to the edge of this hotel... you are so near yet so far. At times we could hear the dim roar of a plane or two - it is very dim though. We have always had a truly great sleep in this hotel though. Strawberries and cream greeted us as we entered the room. The room was lovely and the bathrooms are one of the best I've seen.. big and airy with a separate bath. The rooms are very comfortable. Being fitness freaks (we're not, but we do try when we can) we thought we'd give the gym a work out. The gym is very modern with all the latest high-tech equipment. From memory, the runners and other cardio equipment had the wonderful TV screens - so motivating. You could watch a whole movie on those things (if the gym's quiet, which it was. We didn't, but you could always watch the ending in your room). This time round we tried out the restaurant Azur for a very late snack. It's huge and very modern - the dark interior of the hotel seems to work. Despite being mostly empty, we were seated next to a large noisy group, like one big happy family. I should have asked for another table but I didn't. Similarly, a single traveller who arrived later was also seated next to us... it all seemed too cosy for comfort given there were so many empty tables - maybe it's a cultural thing to sit together.

Taxi service is quickly available, just ask the bell staff and one will be requested from the airport queue. My longest taxi trip was about 30 minutes and that was for a side trip to the Singapore Zoo/Night Safari (see note below). Room Design - 10/10 I was upgraded to a King Suite. It was HUGE. I can't say if basic rooms had the same amenities. The main bathroom features a large tub (standard, not whirlpool) and enclosed shower with a ceiling based showerhead and handheld option. Water pressure was spectacular. Two sinks and a vanity completed the layout. I will say the glass enclosure around the toilet was a little odd. There was also a small powder room located off the entrance. The suite was separated into a sitting/office area and bed area. The bed area featured a king bed, large plasma TV and walk-in closet. Sitting area had a table, desk and pantry area where the mini-bar was located as well as additional storage. One oddity is that, unlike many suites, there was no real sleeping area in the secondary space that could accommodate extra people, such as children. It was clearly meant for business travelers. For an airport hotel, flight noise was almost non-existant. The only place I could hear anything was in the hall near the entry door and sometimes rarely at the desk. Note to US travelers - we don't see this a lot, but both hotels I stayed in during my trip had a slot just inside the door that fits your room key. This turns the power on to the room. It took me a few moments to figure that out. You have to leave something in there to keep the lights on, if you are stepping out of the room and want to keep the AC going (like for breakfast), any plastic card will do. Room Amenities - 10/10 Bathroom supplies were high end (one of the best hotel shampoos I have ever used actually and didn't leave me smelling like a florist shop). Plenty of towels, the room also included 2 terry robes and two waffle robes. A small box in the bathroom contained toothpaste, q tips, etc, all the essentials. Each nice a cookie was delivered with turndown service. Other amenities included an umbrella for guest use (important in Singapore) and a provided plug adapter. The safe is located in the desk area. Design and Layout - 9/10 The hotel is gorgeous and modern, easily navigated with a ton of visually pleasing design touches (especially the water features surrounding the hallways). However, there is one significant issue I feel compelled to point out. At least on the floor I was staying (and it appeared the ones above), the hallways are open air. During a tropical rainstorm, not uncommon, some rainwater blew into the hallways making them VERY slippery. Staff was making a valiant effort to keep up, but it was hazardous. Especially be aware if you are wearing dress shoes, etc. Amenities - Non Club - 10/10 The pool is uniquely designed, with seating areas in the water arranged for conversation. Sadly, very few people used the pool while I was there. The pool is outdoor, but not an issue given the climate. Showers and changing rooms available. The health club is well equipped, if a little warm when I used it (outside temp 90 deg F so not too surprised). One glaring lack was wireless internet in the room. For a surcharge of 25 SGD per day, I would have preferred not to be chained to the desk. Bring a long network cord. Club Room - 8/10 I was very pleased with the staff and service at the club room. With that said I found the upcharge a little expensive for the services most people would use. Breakfast was good but some variety would have been nice, every day was pretty much an identical offering, except for a different type of sausage. There were also evening cocktails and appetizers but I never made it to the lounge during that time. Drinks and fruit were available during the day. Two features the lounge offers that are added value are included dry cleaning (2 garments/day) and use of conference rooms. If you take advantage of those it definitely becomes a better value. At least when I was there, the lounge was sparsely used. In addition, often when you stay in the club level you get an exclusive floor. That did not seem to be the case here as my room was pre-selected (there was a welcome card in it) prior to my requesting club access. Hotel Staff - 10/10 Every single member of the staff I encountered was helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. The concierge and bell staff were always available to assist, even with basic questions (bonus points to the bell staff who not only knew the average taxi fare to the zoo even gave me suggested routes for walking around it!) Checkin in was prompt and efficient (and very understanding of the fact I was completely brain-dead). Check-out was handled in the lounge while I had breakfast. My only issue was that one day housekeeping apparently disposed of 2 taxi receipts I had left in the desk area. Dining - 9/10 The hotel has several venues. I dined at Azur on the 2nd floor, which offers both A La Carte and Buffet dining. The quality and variety of the buffet was excellent, with several action stations. And you can never go wrong with self-dipped ice cream (I saw this a lot in Asia). Service was a little slow, I noticed many people, myself included, had to wait for the check to be presented for payment. Comments and Notes: The hotel is still fairly new (less than 4 months) and I get the impression the staff is still settling into their routines. But there is definite evidence of a desire to provide good service at a top notch facility. Tourist note - While in Singapore, be sure to visit the Zoo and Night Safari when you can. Layout and facilities wise the zoo there is one of the best I have seen, allowing you up close and clear access to the animals. The night safari offers a totally different experience, one not available at most zoos which close before dark. You can purchase a combo ticket for both at a nice price. The tram at Night Safari is a must buy, if you don't mind walking, the one at the zoo is optional. The zoo has also just opened a new conservation and animal themed play area. It was a school holiday when I was there and it was full of screaming happy kids. A great design note, the play area is set a little off the main zoo area, so the noise does not penetrate the general calm atmosphere of the facility. If you want to make a late start day of it, arrive at the zoo around 2, stay till 6, then walk over to Night Safari and dine at Ulu Ulu. You can order counter service, or there is a buffet in the rear.", "Date": "December 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "amidgett", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "amidgett", "ReviewID": "UR22487408", "Content": "I like this hotel.

Decided to delay reviewing the hotel to allow the hotel to \"settle down\" as it was only opened early this year. My verdict is that this is the best airport hotel that I have stayed in to date (and I have stayed in quite a few in the last few years)! Pros: - large, well furnished and designed (rather funky in a way) 5 star rooms; plasma TV; DVD; Ipod docks; in draw safe; free chocolate cookies and mineral water - large well equipped bathroom with rainwater shower and bath tub - great location (esp for T3 but T1 and T2 are only seconds / minutes away on free and regular monorail service); 30 mins from city on MRT - very friendly staff (overenthusiastic at times) - adequate but good brand new gym facilities - adequate F&B facilities; better still - quick access to landside F&B facilities at T3 Cons: - not much except to make sure that you get a good price for the rooms (Singapore room prices have significantly gone up over the years) Some reviewers have complained about plane noise. This has not been a problem to me at all (maybe I am a city person and have a rather high tolerance to \"noise\"; the \"street noise\" level from my bedroom in Sydney is definitely higher than the room in the hotel) and I thought that the sound insulation was good and more than adequate for me. But don't expect 100% sound-proof rooms. In fact I prefer to stay in the rooms facing the runway as I quite enjoy looking at the aircraft comings and goings. If you are a light sleeper you should request rooms facing the street / entrance side of the hotel and if you can only sleep in zero decibel rooms then this hotel is not for you (the claustrophobic, smaller and lower quality transit hotel rooms in the airside area of Changi may be quieter but this is because they lack windows). Another issue that may concern some people is that the walkways connecting the hotel rooms are not airconditioned (in fact open air (perforated walls) in parts - but thats part of the architectural design). Thus, walking to and from your rooms in the heat and humidity may be a rather strange / uncomfortable experience for some especially if you have just arrived from a cool climate country or have been too accustomed to the airconditioned spaces at Changi Airport.

The hotel is brand spanking new, very modern, a mix of metal and glass that is easy on the eye. After a warm welcome and a smooth check-in, I went into my room and noticed it was facing the runway right off Terminal 3. Translation: lots of aircraft noise, at least potentially (it was nearly 10 PM by then and I had hardly slept over the previous 24 hours). Plus the in-room safe was malfunctioning. I went back to reception to ask for a quieter room and was promptly given the keys to room 636, facing Terminal 2 (which is further away and therefore means a much quieter experience). My room was tastefully done, a mix of modern and traditional in an Asian sense, a little like the rooms at the Parker Meridien in NYC. I slept quite well: the A/C in the room was whisper-quiet, the bed quite comfortable although perhaps a tad too firm (even for me!) and the sound insulation rather good. Something strange though: there is light coming from two frosted windows in the bathroom, so if you require total darkness to sleep, that might be a problem for you. I got up late the following morning and showed up too last minute to have breakfast there; I had a look at their buffet offering though and was not impressed by their breakfast selection (buffet breakfast costs SGD28 and is usually served between 6:30 AM until 10:30 AM). I also inquired about their Internet fee and learned they charge a whopping SGD0.85 per minute! Fortunately, the amount is capped at SGD33.00 for 24 hours (wired & wireless), so you won\u2019t get charged over $100 if you happen to be surfing for a couple of hours! The pool is rather large and sits in very modern surroundings. Part of the pool is landscaped; actually more than half the width of the pool is sprinkled with concrete blocks with a palm tree each in the middle. Not the best design choice, as the pool now allows for two or three people at most doing laps comfortably at any one time. I was alone in the pool the morning I was there, so no problem at all for me! A few miscellaneous notes before I forget. 1- The hotel lobby is cool in a dark kind of a way, reminding me of the bar and reception area of the W Hotel in Montreal; this is definitely not your run-of-the-mill Crowne Plaza! 2- There is still a bit of construction happening at the hotel, I think they had about 100 rooms to complete when I was there; I wasn\u2019t bothered by the noise, except while in the pool area. 3- The staff is friendly and gracious. 4- The showers have terrific water pressure. 5- Given the fact that this hotel is not fully operational yet, I think prices could come down a bit. SGD280 for their most basic room with no breakfast is a little steep, in my humble opinion! The place holds promise, though.

The hallway was exposed, and frankly, all of the concrete and black and brown sheet metal really seemed cheap. In fact, the cast iron \"bars\" that surrounded the facade added to the \"cheap\" feel. But no matter, off to a shower and a nice bed. What? Door was bolted on 629? The doorman knocked on the door, and finally a young lady answered. Unfortunately, she was not my wife and probably wouldn't take kindly to sharing a room. So the bellman runs back to the front desk, leaving me and my luggage in the hallway for another 20 minutes.

Hmmm, nice shampoo, but what's this-no hot water? Brrr.. OK, forget it, I'll try in the morning. Zooooooom Zoooooom planes sure run late here at Changi, but it's 6 am and time for my nice hot shower. But what? No hot water again? That's it, I'm checking out. Yes, I left my key card up in the room. Yes, really I did. If you need to charge me for it, send someone up to check I can't get in again. Yes, really I left it there. Seriously folks, they blew it with this property. Hopefully they will get the bugs worked out, but really as cheap and dark as this place feels you woudl be much better off to spend the S$3 on a train ride into town. For S$300 you'll get a much better deal at the Conrad, HI Atrium, or even the old HI Parkview.", "Date": "June 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cA Little slice of Heaven\u201d", "Author": "ExtremeJ", "ReviewID": "UR17278795", "Content": "I stayed at the Crowne Plaza for one night after four weeks in Europe on the way home to Australia to break the flight. The hotel is situated right at Changi Airport. What a delight. The hotel had only been open three weeks and it was wonderful. The room was spacious, clean and I didn't move from it. I ordered in room service for dinner which was delicious, luxuriated in the large deep bath and slept soundly in the huge comfortable bed. I hightly recommend this hotel for a stopover from Australia-London-Australia, if you want to break the long flight for a rest. It is about a 30 minute cab ride to the city centre if you want to shop. The breakfast was outstanding as well.
