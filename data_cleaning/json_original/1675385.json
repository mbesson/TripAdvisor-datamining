I stayed in room 119 which was in the back and faced the street but I wasn\u2019t there for sightseeing. It was noisy in the morning. The room was clean and functional. The shower head was horrible but I didn\u2019t care, I needed a comfortable place to stay for a night. Ask for a discount if you pay in cash/US dollars. I received one and only paid $60 including tax for the night. In comparison with the other airport hotels, this was a steal. The NH was asking for $189 a night plus tax and the Holiday Inn was asking for $109 plus tax. I would recommend for it 1-2 night stays.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rimini, Italy", "Title": "\u201cOnce it was wonderful!\u201d", "Author": "MarkZambo", "ReviewID": "UR124167975", "Content": "We were here the first time in the 90 years, I think it was just opened, and then we came back.

The staff was friendly, but the restaurant had the worst food I think I've ever eaten, and it was about 500 pesos for two people to eat, but given the location of the hotel, there are no other options nearby. The worst part was that after we talked to them about a ride to the airport the night before, they did not have enough room in the shuddle for my girlfriend and I. We could not wait another half hour to leave (it was 5 AM, we had a 7:30 flight), so we had to hire a car for 120 pesos to take us to the airport in order to not miss our flight. Definatly would not reccomend this hotel.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "York, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cConvenient and affordable\u201d", "Author": "DeboCo79", "ReviewID": "UR118436294", "Content": "GP is located in not a nice area, but at a mere 10 minutes drive from the airport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Terminal 1 (frequent shuttle service included in the 63 Dollars tariff), it becomes a sensible choice to anyone looking for a clean and affordable place to spend the night.

On the advertising photos the hotel looks nice. And this why I have chosen it. BIG MISTAKE! The entrance, the lobby, the corridors and the doors to the rooms are OK. But when you get to the room it looks like a ghetto hotel room. The room is dark, the curtains are dark, the bed cover is dark... The bathroom is big, but it looks old and it is old. I could not find any electric socket in the room to recharge my mobile phone, so I had to move the desk with the TV, as the only available socket I could find was behind. The room gives to a noisy street with all night traffic. There was no heating in the room, so it was really cold even with the light blanket that was available. Internet connection. I could not connect to the internet and went to the lobby for assistance. Nobody was able to assist me. I wanted to use one of the computers in the lobby. One of the receptionists was using the second one. The computer I wanted to use did not work so I asked the receptionist what could I do. I don't remember the reply, but I gave up and went back to my room. Luckily I have stayed only few hours in this hotel as I had an early flight. I usually stay at the very nice NH Aeropuerto T2 which is conveniently located nearly in the hall of the Mexico airport, but this time it was fully booked. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. Don't buy the advertising photos!!! The only good thing of this hotel is the free of charge transfer from and to the airport.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Grand Prix Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d1675385-Reviews-Grand_Prix_Hotel-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "Price": "$89 - $100*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Av Rio Churubusco 200</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Colonia Granjas</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Mexico City</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">06470</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1675385", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b5/63/b56307c00cf11ea6e324cb824128be503large.jpg"}}
