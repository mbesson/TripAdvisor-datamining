It is a beautiful hotel. I booked the \"classic\" room (the lower-priced option) and got a great King bed, and nice sized room overall by London standards.

I also had a meeting at the Royal College of Physicians, which is just on the edge of Regent's Park. If you have a meeting there, use the nearest gate into the park, and it is less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel. I was on a tight budget so I didn't have breakfast in the hotel which I believe was 21 pounds. The only criticism that I have is the cleanliness of the room. When I moved the drapes, the wall behind the desk had visible mildew on the wallpaper. Not sure why. The bathroom was reasonably clean but there appeared to be dust on top of the amenities. And when I opened my computer when I came back to the office, a lot of dust had setllted on the keyboard, which I have never had happen. The sheets and bedding (the important part to me) and towels were immaculate, as was the tub/shower. However if you are super-fussy about cleanliness, you wouldn't have liked my room.

The check in and out process went well. The staff were fine and the reception and communal areas of the hotel were excellent. The location is good just away from the main road so traffic noise is minimised. 3 underground stations are nearby - we mainly used Warren Street (10 mins walk) and Great Portland St (5 mins walk) which enabled quick access to most of the city.

No free wifi was a bit of a downer at the hotel as in these times I feel it should come as an attractive bonus to your stay?

The location of the hotel is perfect for anyone wanting to enjoy what London has to offer - close to the bars, shops, restaurants and theatres of the West End, convenient for the City, and yet tucked away from the manic hustle and bustle of the city. The rooms are very small, but are also very comfortable. The beds are very comfy. The bathrooms have high end fittings, but are quite cramped. The showers are often in alcoves and are quite dark, while last time I had to manoeuvre sideways to use the toilet. Not a big deal, but irritating. I would say they were ideal for a single person, or a couple, who intended to spend most of their time out and about. They are probably not great for a family, The rest of the hotel is very plush and high end. The lifts are bizarre (you have to specify your floor in the lobby and get allocated to a lift), but in terms of a review that is neither here nor there. The only big criticism I have of the hotel is the price, and not just of the rooms. When paying for a room in a top end hotel, I find it frustrating when they charge an additional amount for things like internet access, and there was no wi-fi in the rooms. The staff have always been courteous, but not particularly friendly or efficient. All in all, this is a hotel I would recommend if you can get a deal on the price, or if your company is paying. I would not consider staying here if I had to pay the full price.

We treated ourselves to a late-night drink in the bar which is a good size and very comfortable, although a couple more staff to speed up the service would be a benefit. The lack of car parking is a problem, although you can park on the street close by, you just have to watch out for when and where you need to pay.

I've stayed about 3 times in the last 9 months. The building looks great and the lobby is promising. Every room seems to be a different size. I've only ever stayed in standard rooms but the first time I stayed I had a lovely large room, the second time it was a smaller room and this time it was a cupboard. The room was so tiny it felt like a cave, it was dark and had a long dark corridor from the door to the main room past the bathroom, separate toilet and wardrobe. I couldn't squeeze past the end of the bed to get to the desk. I called down to ask for a different room and the receptionist first denied that it was a small room and said all 'Classic' rooms are quite small (I know that's not the case because of having larger rooms before). She then asked me to pay for an ugrade. No way! I said. I did get moved to a slightly larger room at the end of the corridor. The rooms were obviously once elegant, now they're dated, walls are scuff marked, the colour scheme is Spanish c.1990. For a central London, expensive, supposedly high end business hotel I'm amazed this place doesn't have wifi. The LAN cable doesn't stretch to the bed so you are forced to sit at the desk to use a laptop. There's hardly any plug sockets in the room, none by the bed, only 1 at the desk and 1 on the opposite side of the room. It's so badly thought out - how am I supposed to plug my lap top in and charge my phone and work productively with this set up?

I travelled into Kings Cross station on the 0920 from Durham, arriving in London a little after noon. Taxi fare to the hotel was only \u00c2\u00a36.00 and the journey took under ten minutes. Having never stayed at the Melia before, I proceeded to the front check-in area, where I was promptly dealt with by a courteous member of staff. I was informed that as a 'Level' guest, all formalities would be dealt with at an exclusive check-in area at the rear of the lobby, where I would be given my room key and an introduction to the inclusive facilities associated with the 'Level'. My cases were carried from the front lobby to a waiting area at the rear, and then onto my room. It is important to remember that whist the 'Level' costs a little more than a standard room, the use of the lounge, afternoon drinks and fully inclusive breakfast make it a very persuasive option. The afternoon cakes and late afternoon canapes etc simply add to the experience. The room itself was on the 4th floor of the hotel, and provided two sided views of the surrounding area. The purpose for booking a suite, was that my wife would have a comfortable environment in which to rest, watch TV etc during my evaluation/assesment time at the clinic, and this proved to be particularly worthwhile. The room was large and airy, though the bathroom was a little smaller than usual, albeit very well appointed. The only downside from our viewpooint, was the absence of a pillow top on the bed, which is something that we have grown to expect in most mid to upper end establishments, especially in the USA. The hotel is situated a mere 5mins walk from Harley Street, and is adjacent to Regents Park. Eateries are plentifull within walking distance, and there are a number of convelience stores across the road at the top of Portland St. Having undergone surgery on the Thursday morning, we returned to the hotel where the staff made every effort to afford that extra bit of consideration, particularly given my desire for low lighting and additional tissues and towels. The maid was particularly helpful, as were the staff in the lounge, where we sat in candlelight throughout the evening. On the Friday morning, check-out was prompt and efficient, and concluded a pleasant stay at the Melia, which we hope to visit again in the not too distant future. Many thanks to all.

However, there is a one major issue that would prevent me from staying there again and several minor ones which are merely annoyances. The major issue is the internet. I have no problem paying for the internet but the performance was absolutely shocking. For a business user who travels extensively a high-speed internet connection is an absolute must. The fact that they don't have WiFi in the rooms ensured I had to go to the Apple store to buy a USB-network adapter for my MacBook Air but that was nothing in comparison to the poor speed. The minor annoyances are in the way of the ergonomics. The big heavy workdesk is positioned in such a way as you have to push the table to be able to plug your laptop in - and it's heavy! In addition the iron and ironing board in the room is a great touch but positioning the bed and other furniture in the room as to make it almost impossible to iron a shirt is a minus.

The bad bits: you queue forever to check in and out, the staff seem to fail to grasp that the interests of guests should supersede the shortcomings of the hotel's bureaucracy.

Room 799 a junior suite, has a comfortable bed, and is a nice room, but with a bit of thought could be stunning. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the small things that add up. The bath room bath is half size, no light on the shower and the single sink cluttered. The sitting room, would seat 6 easily, so why not reduce it and upgrade the bathroom. The walk in closet is long, yet the rails are on the shortest wall. The safe is small \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and will not take a laptop, and the tea tray is found here and every day makes its way back. There is no power point so each day you walk it back to the table. The lighting switches and d\u00c3\u00a9cor (and most of the staff) are Spanish. The staff are attentive. The Level is not anything to write home about, the sofas and lay out are unwelcoming. Breakfast in the level is less of a crush, but there is a single toaster and if you get behind the lady doing 18 pieces, eat bread. The food is good, but the service is overly brisk, for instance trying to remove the plates, before you have finished eating \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or when you go back for your toast. In ten minutes three staff all had designs on my plate, but my wife fended them off. The restaurant is FANTASTIC. I have not tried Spanish food before and had invited 4 friends to meet for evening meal. We all had different course, which were the best food I have eaten in a hotel. The wine was good value and excellent. Service was perfect. The only small down side was the live Spanish Guitarist, he sang and played beautifully, but was only 6 foot away, making conversation difficult. The bar area, the room is beautiful.

Upon arrival, I confirmed that my room, breakfast and taxes would be from a central account with extras on me.

Next morning - woken by housekeeping at 7.05am, wanting to do the room .... please come back ... 8am knock knock housekeeping! .... I left to go and get breakfast, tripped over the tray from the night before which had not been removed. I found the housekeeping staff on the floor and asked for the room to be done while I was at breakfast and for the tray to move. I was told tray was \"not their responsibility\". Went to breakfast - seated on a high traffic corner near the toaster, which is malfunctioning on the morning in question. Coffee takes 20 minutes to arrive and no one seems to be my server. Its buffet self serve so not too matter ... I set about getting what I need from a well appointed selection. As I am to leave, there is a long discussion about whether my breakfast is included in the rate or not. No one knows what is going on. I return to my room after a little over an hour - the tray is gone but the room is not made up. I head out for middle of day and early evening business. On return to hotel, I check that my bill will be split correctly at early check out the next day. 7am check out - given bill for total including room, breakfast and tax - told no record of payment from a central account.

There were some pro's, but also a lot of con's, all in all, it seems like the hotel is in need of re-training. From the get go, reception was poorly managed - we stood in line for 20minutes behind 3 people registering - how is this possible? Especially when you have 3 people working the registration desk. As we were there as a team, we were booked via corporate travel, unfortunately, somewhere in the system some of us had \"level\" rooms, which granted access to the level lounge (Free wifi, breakfast, snacks, drinks in the evening), which costs at least +30L each night.. Some of us were in a standard room with breakfast and no internet and vice versa.. Trying to sort that out with reception we were told \"reservations handles this\". Which is absolutely silly. We had to ask for a manager. The elevators are odd - you have to go to a central console, press your desired floor number, then you are directed to one of four elevators. Is that really necessary for a 9 floor hotel? Regarding facilities, aesthetically, this isn't the most pleasing hotel - you enter the lobby to a lot of columns and a small set of stairs (6), which you drag your bags down, and limited seating space near registration (you can't need that many columns for structural support); the rooms are small (narrow doors), sadly the desk space didn't have a desk lamp (only an overhead desk lamp attached to the wall - making it very difficult (dim) to work on a laptop when you had to be connected via wired internet); the bathroom was small - not only was the tub unfit for an adult (only a small child could fit in it), the only light in the bathroom was above the sink, so when you showered, no light filtered in (wall separating the shower from the sink), and the water pressure was terrible! If you increased the temperature of the water, the pressure reduced, and regardless of where you set the temperature it would shift during use. The walls were terribly thin - one evening, the next door neighbor took calls from their bed, and I could hear every word! And why is the iron attached to the ironing board? at 190L/night, your clientele should be self-selected. Some of the staff were very nice and accommodating, and others less so. Unfortunately, much of our frustration occurred around our room rates, amenities for our rooms (internet, breakfast), all of which could be solved with process flow efficiency (no one should ever stand in line that long); empowerment of staff to address customer needs without management. The location of the Melia is very convenient.

In this case it meant there was just 12\" from the end of the bed to the wall, the TV must have been one of those invented by John Logie Baird, the bedside furniture had the once fashionable \"distressed\" look but the piece de resistance was the bathroom. The bath was about 3 feet deep but was tiny in all modern respects. There was barely just enough room to sit in it. If you are over 5' 7\" tall, then getting in would be easy but sitting down might not be comfortable. It is not a good example of a comfortable bath in which you can relax after a day walking in london or after a long journey. But, the story does not end there - arising from the throne is not comfortable - there is less than 12 inches from your nose to the wall when you get up from the toilet! The wash hand basin is tiny and altogether, if there are 2 of you, with 2 suitcases, plus hand baggage, I wonder how you will get on in the main room. Then there is the soundproofing, I was able to hear the mighty roar of London's traffic and the conversation, admittedly a little loud, in the next room! My buffet breakfast in a small and very busy dining room was only warm and, at \u00c2\u00a323, is another expensive outlay. You can get it at half price if you take out a loyalty card, which I did. But, I was so appalled at the bathroom that I asked for the price of the breakfast to be taken off the bill. The manager had to be consulted but customer care here extends to saying 'No!' The hotel is run by a Spanish company and at \u00c2\u00a3168 is just not worth the money. I wonder what room I would have been given if I was Spanish. We are reminded of their need to conserve water (like many other places) and they grow herbs on the roof top.............Oh, they also give money to charity. I would suggest to them that charity might begin at home and, for the not cheap price of \u00c2\u00a3168, they improve the facilities in their 'Classic' room. It would appear the hotel is very busy, but what does that say about the hotel industry in London in particular? To me it says I will look to see if there are better hotels for that price for I will not be staying here again!", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gold Coast, Australia", "Title": "\u201cPete&GlorQld\u201d", "Author": "Peter M", "ReviewID": "UR118804331", "Content": "Service excellent, especially the concierge whose knowledge of sightseeing and local bus & train services, was most helpful.

There are handy branches of EAT on Euston Road. I ate at the many restaurants within a stones throw in the Marylebone Road area. Avoid the bland Pizza Express as there are so many better alternatives. Just wander and see what you fancy. If stuck or tired try the gastro pub (Artichoke and Lettuce) behind which has a nice but occasionally rowdy (with loud office party types) dining room on first floor. Melia are a reliable chain and have taken over this palace in the last cou0pl of years. They are working on refurbishments progressively. This is a good example of their standard.

You have to enter the floor you want to go to when you call for the elevator and the system selects which car will take you there. I guess its meant to energy efficient etc, but was a pain getting a car to get you to the floor.

My initial introduction to this was the lobby toilets (day 1 hot and very smelly, day 2 toilets blocked...). In my room (604) the drainage is so poor that I was standing in water from the previous day whilst showering, and the noise from the drains would wake me up from time to time. Shower door does not seal leaving water all over the floor. It's unfortunately something all older hotels battle with in London and bar keeping the lobby washrooms clean every day, there is not much they can do about it I think. I'm in London in one of the busiest times of the year so rooms are pricy (over $550 a night). However this is not the case for the greater part of the year. Something that did concern me at check-in was a double charge on my card that were both wrong. Mistakes happen, but the booking system they use should not have allowed two extra incorrectly charged transactions. Btw my bank alerted me to this problem whilst I was checking in. I believe this was reversed though I have not yet checked. Should you consider them? Absolutely, the staff alone make it worthwhile.

You have to pay 10 GBP for 2 hours if you want to sit in the lobby and use their wifi. I was also told that I could go in the bar and it would be free if I continued to purchase drinks. It's so loud in the bar with their cheesy lounge singer that it was impossible to make a phone call in there. The showers in the bathroom are poorly designed. There is absolutely no way of taking a shower without water getting all over the floor. We notified the front desk of the problem and all they did was bring us more towels. Since electrical appliances (other than shavers) aren't allowed to be plugged in the bathroom, I had to plug my curling iron into the outlet near the desk, but there's no mirror there. The only mirror was around the corner on the closet. Horrible design. The front desk personnel, concierge and housekeeping staff do not communicate. After my umbrella was stolen at a cafe, I called down to the front desk to see if the hotel had umbrellas available for guests. I was told that they would send housekeeping up with the umbrella. As I was heading out, I said I would pick the umbrella up from the front desk on my way down. When I got to the front desk, I was told the hotel didn't carry umbrellas. After explaining that I had just called down and was told they DID have umbrellas, I was told to talk to the Concierge. The Conciege also told me they don't have umbrellas and after again explaining that I had called down and told otherwise, I was told that housekeeping would bring an umbrella up to my room. Anyway, I had to wait 20 minutes to get an umbrella... so frustrating! I stayed at multiple hotels during my trip to London and all had impeccable guest services and a very high level of room quality. Melia, however, is not one of them.

Upon checking in I was made to feel very welcome - had booked it all online and they had my details. The room was very clean - a bit on the small side - we had the classic double room on the 4th floor (room 428) - but suited us both fine. There was tea/coffee/hot chocolate in the room. They gave me two cards upon check in - one to get in and out of the room, and one to fit into an area on the wall to make the electricity work. There was an ac/heating which you could adjust to get the room as hot or cold as you wanted (took me a little bit to figure out that one even after asking one of the maids about it). The first night I didn't sleep very well although i'd only travelled from Manchester, I'm pretty sure it was the bed/pillows, the second night I asked for an extra pillow and slept okay. The concierge on the desk was very helpful (I think he was called Henry), he knew the area well so helped us out with where to go and how best to get there. I got Travel Cards for each of the 3 days I was in London (as opposed to oyster cards) which made travelling around very easy. The nearest tube station to the hotel was Great Portland Street - literally a 2 minute walk. Regent's Park tube station was about a 7 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel staff were very friendly, they allowed me to store my bags after i'd checked out until that evening when I picked them up. My room was cleaned on the morning of my second day there and I was asked if I wanted the room cleaned on the 3rd morning, the maid was still cleaning when I got back to the room to check out about 2.30pm. As I was a member of the MAS scheme (the hotels loyalty programme) I was allowed a late check out - 2pm as opposed to 12pm. However, I'd gotten caught up in a 3.5 hour queue at Madame Tussauds, so I rang the hotel twice to let them know I would be a little late. Reception was quite friendly and asked what time I would make it for. I ended up checking out about 40 mins later (10 minutes after I had initially told them) but they were quite understanding about it. Overall, although I didn't experience the hotel restaurant or bar, and was out for the majority of the 3 days experiencing the London tourist spots, the hotel was beautiful and I enjoyed my stay there.

However, quite where it manages to get its four stars is beyond the mental capacities of this author for he is not up to date with the latest rules and regulations governing such decisions. One can only surmise that it is down to the cleanliness of the rooms and, they are, to be sure, spotless. The service is excellent too, even if it does, on first instincts, speak Spanish. However, beyond these two factors, I cannot fathom how a hotel that, apparently, caters exclusively for dwarfs, imps, and other small peoples, can possibly deserve its fourth star. Let me elucidate. The bedroom was, according to the website, a double. Not a chance! At best it was a single that had eaten too much and was slightly overweight. Whilst I enjoyed the close contact with my girlfriend that this situation thrust upon me, I regularly woke during the night to find myself hanging off the bed or, worse still, taking up too much room. And the pillows! They must have been filled by a miserly fellow for they were about as bulky as a poor man's wallet. Needless to say, the support they provided was almost nonexistent. So, in addition to waking up without any room, I also woke up with a stiff neck. Onto the bathroom, for here, if nowhere else, is further proof that I was in the hobbit's quarters. The bath was three feet long. Granted, it was quite deep but three feet long? If the hotel is trying to recreate the good old days when one would take a bath in a tin tub, it's doing a fine job. The toilet, also , caused much confusion. There was no space to sit on it. Anybody over five feet (and I am 6,2) is required to place their knees up the wall just to sit down. This position places one's rear far deeper into the toilet than one might desire. On some occasions you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have the impression that you had accidentally sat down on a bidet. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no wardrobe either, or any cupboards or draws of a decent size into which a person of average weight might want to place their clothes. All the cupboards and draws are tiny. The one closet in the room houses the safe, an ironing board (incidentally, the room had a trouser press \u00e2\u20ac\u201c oooh!), and the kettle. There is no plug in the closet to use said items; one has to transport them around the room. Finding space to use the ironing board is impossible. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great saving grace is its location. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right next to Great Portland Street tube station from where one can easily transport oneself to all the sights and sounds of the capital. It is also round the corner from Regent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Park, which is a great place to take a walk and find some much sought after fresh air, and to stretch the aching muscles you will have from a poor night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southport", "Title": "\u201cRoom 278 - Pokey Room Rock Hard bed\u201d", "Author": "Diskdr", "ReviewID": "UR101106120", "Content": "Having booked a junior suite, you might expect it to be bright and airey - not so.

We chose this hotel for our last night because his company uses this hotel when arranging client meetings, etc, and it is within a 5 minute walk to the office. Overall the hotel is very nice, the lobby is clean and elegant, and the staff at the front desk were very friendly, (the concierge on the other hand could have tried to be a little nicer considering it is his job to help lost or confused guests find there way around...minus the attitude!) The downside to this hotel was truly the size of the rooms. For about 180 pounds a night, (and that's on a corporate rate,) the room was miniscule. There was a kind sized bed which essentially took up the entire room, and a desk where you couldn't even fit your legs under in the chair they provided you. The bathroom was literally the smallest thing I had ever seen in my life. Your knees can touch the sink from the toilet, and you have to step up into a corner shower/tub which you are fearful you might fall in the process just to take a cramped shower. I know London hotels are small, and real estate is precious, etc - but I really think this was pushing it. It is a nice enough hotel, but the value for the price does NOT add up, (unless of course you have business purposes within walking distance since it is in a business area). I definitely would not recommend this hotel for leisure and if you are paying your own way. Oh also, a tip, if you order internet to the room (not sure if this is common in Europe or not) but you can only hook up ONE COMPUTER'S IP Address! I would have assumed if you pay for internet you paid for the room, but when I hooked up my laptop, my boyfriend couldn't log in to his own work computer to finalize some things for his meeting the following morning.

So for CLCC it is ideally placed and the closest hotel. In fact the location generally is 5 star- top of Great Portland Street, 10 mins walk from Oxford Street and adjacent to Regent's park. I also have to say that the staff I encountered were top notch. Special thanks to the excellent commissionaire who spent ages trying to get a fax for me, and the manager who sorted movement of my room (more below). Now the not so good. First, the rooms are generally very small- yes, expected in London but this was small. They also looked a little tired, and I have seen cleaner rooms. Next, the first night I was in a room adjacent to the lift and got virtually zero sleep, due to the cables pulling the lifts sort of hitting the other side of the wall behind my head. I complained the next day, and the manager kindly arranged for my things to be shifted across to another room. As I say the staff I encountered were good. However, the first night in my new room was also not great. It was one of those with a connecting door to the next room for families. Unfortunately there was little sound insulation in this door, in fact you could hear everything next door. You can probably imagine it was an interesting night when an amorous couple with a penchant for what sounded like spanking started next door. I will say no more save to say that by the fourth 'session' at 4am it had gone from amusing to tiresome. Fortunately the following night there was a nice Scottish lady in the adjacent room who was very quiet. I never met her, but heard her entire telephone conversation to her friend so I knew she was nice.... and Scottish. Bar prices were also very expensive. My client and I indulged in a 'few' G&Ts in the bar, but I was surprised to receive a \u00c2\u00a3200 bill- it had been over \u00c2\u00a39 per G&T and then they had put service charge on.

As we were arriving into London at Euston, any hotel within that vincinity would be ideal.

OK, it's a central London hotel, so it wasn't exactly cheap, but fair value for the money. Our room was a junior suite, which was very tastefully furnished, though the sofa was in completely the wrong place for any meaningful use (except as a sofa-bed). Still, a very comfortable room and nice bathroom. TV was a big old cathode ray model with limited channels for this grade of hotel. We really enjoyed having drinks in the cocktail bar, where I would recommend actually sitting at the bar if possible, as the cocktail waiters are both friendly and fun to watch when they are busy! We ate one night in the restaurant and we were totally overwhelmed by the quality of the seafood dishes that we chose. We had not chosen the White House specifically for its food, but this really is a very fine restaurant and well worth trying. Breakfast was served in their club room (The Level) and was a very good buffet selection served in very comfortable surroundings. The only problem we had (and it was a very minor one) was that, being slightly \"off the beaten track\", there was not always a taxi waiting outside! Mind you, we never had to wait more than 5 minutes or so for one to turn up!

THE ROOM ITSELF When I got to my room, I was surprised to find that my \"Queen\"-sized bed was actually two twin beds pushed together. They were even made separately, with two sets of twin sheets so it wasn't even made to look like a single bed. The room was tiny and hard to squeeze into - And I'm a New Yorker, so used to small rooms! INTERNET CONNECTION Since Internet was included in my room, and this was a business trip, I attempted to sign on to check email. When I couldn't find a WiFi network for my iPad to connect to, I called downstairs and the front desk let me know there wasn't actually a WiFi connection, that I had to use a hard-wire. [This would have been helpful to know in advance!] When I tried to use the hard-wire for the Internet connection, I also had no luck. I called downstairs again and asked if they could reset the connection. 25 minutes later they were able to get it to work. TV However, whilst making the Internet connection work, my TV somehow was changed from English to German. [Grrr!!] While I'm not a big TV watcher myself, it should also be noted that there were approximately 7 channels to choose from, so not a large selection by any standards. SLEEP/NOISE My first night at the hotel, I was exhausted from traveling, and while it was noisy when I went to sleep, I was able to get a decent amount of sleep. The second night, the noises got worse. It sounded like there was construction happening right behind my head. At 11p, it was still quite loud, so I called downstairs asking if they could please make sure that any workers held off on noisy construction until the morning. They denied any sort of construction or workers, and were very defensive. In the end they agreed to bring me ear plugs, but only because I specifically requested them. Again, being a New Yorker, I'm used to ambient noise of the streets of NYC, but the level of noise at Melia was way beyond this. Despite the fact that I mentioned I had been trying to sleep for an hour and a half, they took a half an hour to bring me ear plugs. BREAKFAST Skip breakfast if you're in a hurry. Instead of using your room-key to check-in or pay for breakfast, there is a gentleman who checks your name against your room number. It isn't quick or efficient, especially when there are 20+ people in line to get into the breakfast hall. CHECKING OUT Again, a huge lack of efficiency. Instead of getting the bill under the door, or just being able to turn your room key into a box, you have to wait in line to check out. It took 30 minutes for me to check out. OVERALL While Reagents Park may be a great location, I will never revisit Melia. In fact, even if I had to travel for work and my company would only pay for Melia, I would go to the extent of booking a hotel and paying for it with my own money to not have to deal with them again.", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDo not care what you say you do not have a problem & we will not check on it\u201d", "Author": "amfedup1", "ReviewID": "UR86010140", "Content": "Checked in to this hotel on Nov 3 after long day when trying to go to sleep loud pipelike banging was occuring behind my bed called the front desk they said they would send someone up no one showed up called again got the run around finally told to come down & speak to manager was told maitenance stood in hall heard no sound so there was no sound will not change your room go back to bed or leave pretty good for L185 a night", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clarksville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cReally great location, okay hotel\u201d", "Author": "Luckygirl66", "ReviewID": "UR84612219", "Content": "The Melia is in an excellent location, once you step out of the Great Portland Street, just across the street and your there.

We had a very pleasant week - check in was smooth, and they were able to give us an early check in, which after an overnight flight was great! The hotel caters to mainly a Spanish clientele, and most of the staff spoke Spanish as their first language. We didn't encounter any problems with language, and all of the staff were eager to assist us. Our room was small by North American Standards, but larger than other London hotels that I've stayed in. The bathroom was compact, but efficient - the only drawback was the height of the tub - which would be a challenge to get into if you weren't able to lift your legs fairly high. The elevator call system is a bit different, but easy to get used to. The location of the hotel is on the edge of Regent's Park, and is within walking distance of several subway stops. We faced a subway strike during our stay, but were able to get around on the buses which also are close to the hotel. The concierge was very capable, and able to advise us on several matters. We took a couple of tours, and were picked up at the hotel, which was convenient. The concierge sells tickets to the hop on hop off bus tour, and we were able to charge them to our room. We ate breakfast every morning in the hotel as it was part of our package - it is a buffet style service, not unlike the all inclusive resorts in the Caribbean. The breakfast was good - my sister enjoyed the made to order omlettes, and there was alot to choose from. We didn't eat any other meals at the hotel, preferring to see what else London had to offer. There are a couple of pubs virtually across the street (Okay but not great) - as well as a 24 hr mini grocery store, and we ate several good meals at a Pizza Express restaurant also very near the hotel.

We picked it because of it's location to the tube options (one just across the street, and one just down the block). It is 1 mile due north from Oxford street and all the fantastic shopping. Having said that, we did take a lot of taxi's and found, that even in rush hour, coming from the other end of town, by the Tate Modern, our most expensive taxi was 20 pounds. I had read a lot on here that the staff were unhelpful, but I found the opposite to be true. The concierge was helpful for us day after day, from confirming tours and taxi pick-ups, to suggesting restaurants and tube routes. We dealt with all three shifts of the concierge staff, and they were all most helpful, but, particularly the day and evening shifts. The front desk too was helpful when there was a dispute over our final bill regarding phone calls. All was resolved, with patience on all sides. The breakfast buffet is large and varied, and yes, overpriced, but it is London, and consider it you big meal till mid afternoon. We each had our own coffee and tea pots, which saved for having to have it always topped up. Have breakfast early, when the business crowd is in and out quickly, or you will be inundated with large Spanish families crowding out the room. We did upgrade from a basic double to a deluxe double, simply because we were going to be there 8 nights. This is still not a huge room by any standards, but pretty comparable to what you would find in downtown New York city. The TV had many channel options in English & Spanish and one radio station, and movies and games. We had fluffy duvets, which I always find cleaner than comforters which get cleaned who knows when. The beds were single in size, but there was enough room to manoeuvre around, even with luggage and shopping bags. Maids were friendly and cleaned and topped up supplies each day, including the shortbread biscuits (cookies). The lifts (elevators) had a strange system, but, it seemed to work. It is a Spanish owned chain, therefore seemed to attract a mostly Spanish clientele. All in all, I would recommend this hotel. It wasn't in the heart of the city, but then you didn't have the price or noise that goes along with that", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cWell Placed, Reasonably Priced, Rooms a bit cramped and 'tired'\u201d", "Author": "Melsm57", "ReviewID": "UR82678804", "Content": "Stayed here 4 days early Sept - very close to Gt Portland Street Station - pity there was a tube strike during our stay.

My father in law and I (also staying) looked at each other and said 'did he say 'if possible'?' We then went out for the evening returning around 9:30pm to find no cot in the room. When I called housekeeping, I had a really rude and unhelpful woman who told me they had no more cots and that she had told reception originally that we wouldn't have one. Obviously reception chose to keep this from us!!! I then complained and she said she would ask 'Quality' to speak to me. An hour later I tracked 'Quality' down in reception and he said he knew nothing about it. He went away to see what he could do. 40 minutes later he returned and said they had no cots and there was nothing he could do. I said this is like booking into a hotel and turning up to find you don't have a bed in your room!! There was no provision for this situation, no way of getting one from somewhere else. They had known all day of the problem, they did nothing!!! They just expected our baby to sleep on the floor on a couple of pillows. OUTRAGEOUS. As it was now 11:15pm there was no choice.

The room was small, if not too much for London standards; however there wasn't even one chair and the only \"table\" in the room was more of a ledge with legs, barely 25cm deep and placed in a narrow, poorly-lit, aisle-like space (which is awkward for a four-star hotel that claims to be ideal for business travelers; but of course with a chair and a desk the room would have appeared crammed). The TV was big and a bit old. The closet looked a bit shabby. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was up-to-date but really tiny; not even a shelf for the toilet bag, just the small counter around the sink. Everything was clean enough. There is a coffee and tea kit (inside the closet, as there is no other place to put it). There is something odd about the use of the in-room minibar: an note advises that if the customer uses the minibar to cool his own stuff then he will be charged 15 pounds. No free internet at any area of the hotel. Rate is 15 pounds per 24h. I didn't have breakfast at the hotel; I don'd remember the price but it was in the region of 20 pounds, so I had a good breakfast somewhere nearby (Great Portland St. is just across the street). The hotel is well located but you can find plenty of well located hotels in London at similar or cheaper rates and this one does't add any special value.

It is a 3 minute walk to the tube which we loved. The breakfast was included with our package and it was certainly more than adequate and there was something for everyone. It was a great way to start the day. Our room was very large compared to London standards and the bathroom was fantastic. Our sheets, however, were not changed every night---which one would expect with a hotel of this caliber. It was also not the cleanest room I have ever been in. However, it was NOT offensive. We had to call for extra towels every day as there were 3 of us living there. Here is the thing that bothered me the most. We checked in after a long overnight flight from the States. We get up to the room and need to make a phone call to touch base with friends. The phone would NOT work because we had not left a credit card impression at check in. So down I go to do this and had to wait in a check in line AGAIN. I would have thought they should have asked for this at checkin!! Also, they charge you for everything--movies, computer use in room, phone calls (we paid 4 pounds for a 30 second call), room service was VERY expensive as were the drinks and the restaurants. We were in London the year before and were not charge for all these things. Saying all this, we had a wonderful time and the hotel was just fine. I would give it a 3.5 our of 5.

The heating system alternates between blasting hot air to blasting cold air with the vents pointed at the bed, so I spent much of the time with a stiff neck. The street noise is extremely loud through the single pane windows. Mostly however it was the Service that would not bring me back. For example, twice when I order room service there were problems. The first time they just lost the order. The second time the front desk wouldn't approve it because they couldn't find my credit card number. Its funny because in the rooms they provide a card that says if your requests are not answered in 15 minutes they will give you a free night accommodation. Yet when confronted with this they wouldn't pull through on their promise. I called day one morning and asked for a copy of my bill to review and to leave under my door. By the next day it still wasn't there. I had to call down again. Again it didn't come. By afternoon I called a third time, and they \"weren't sure it could be done\", and that I would have to come down to get it.

By the next day when I returned home and it wasn't there, I had to email them myself.

However, there are a few things that the Melia White House could do to reduce the risk of guests experiencing a bad stay in what is....an OK hotel. First things first, this is the place on Lastminute.com's Top Secret Hotels described as right next to Regent's Park. It's a great building close to Regent's Park and Great Portland Street tube stations, but an enormous building site next door is offputting (but not an issue at all onc you're inside). The Melia White House is a part of a Spanish chain and virtually all the guests there during my visit were Spanish. The decor in the lobby is almost unbelievably naff - think 19 year-old Premiership footballer let loose on his 10-room Chester mansion. Marble, gold fittings - what I imagine Studio 54 looked like (but probably didn't). The lobby was seething with guests but reasonably well run, although it is increibly annoying to turn up at a hotel at 14.30hrs and find that rooms still aren;t ready for check-in - OK, official check-in time is 3pm, but as I say, it is irksome after a lengthy journey. On the guest floors, the decor is slightly calmer - the sort of thing a pensioner would love. At the Melia, less is definitely not more. The rooms are pretty horribly decorated too - like Wallpaper and its interior design ilk never happened. The standard rooms are very narrow and the bathrooms tiny - but cleverly designed to maximise the use of what little space there is. Our bath didn't empty properly after a shower and we received only one set of towels for two people. The free toiletries are watery and nasty. I had two particular complaints. First, at 2.50am during the thrid night of our three night stay we were woken by the TV in the next room. This place is by no means the Generator hostel - it's a family hotel favoured mostly by middle-aged and older people. What sort of inconsiderate (insert expletive here) can't figure out a reasonable volume for their TV in the early hours of the morning? Second, I had originally booked two nights through Lastminute, then subsequently added another night, so I had three consecutive nights booked in total. Despite confirming this upon check in, this caused predictable problems - check out papers being shoved under our door on the second morning; our card keys being deactivated before the third night. Worst of all, when my wife tried to collect a key during our third evening, she was forbidden from doing so and escorted to the room with security people, repeatedly asked for photo ID (note to Melia management: UK citizens do not have to carry photo ID in their country of residence and a great many of us still do not have photo driving licences - or can't drive anyway!). So, all in all, crowded, impersonal, a bit officious, ugly decor, but convenient, not too expensive and with some individual staff members (e.g. the luggage room guy who let us leave our bags overnight even though we weren't due to stay another night at the hotel).", "Date": "November 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cCheck the room size\u201d", "Author": "LGMA", "ReviewID": "UR21932733", "Content": "Nice \"British style\" hotel, with a good standard (better than many 4 star hotels in London).

Something I really liked was that the hotel offer room service food throughout the night. We went down for breakfast in the morning and were absolutely staggered by the sheer amount of food on offer! They have a buffet with pastries, cakes, cereals, fried foods, freshly cooked omelette on request, juices, teas, champagne, even a salami stand! The food was fantastic, and the service was really good too, if a little over-enthusiastic! As bizarre as the stay was in parts, I was genuinely disappointed to leave, and I'd recommend this hotel to anybody looking for a convenient place to stay in central London.", "Date": "October 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Larnaca, Cyprus", "Title": "\u201cNice place\u201d", "Author": "Recoleta", "ReviewID": "UR20818749", "Content": "We were force to upgrade to a deluxe room due to the need for a baby bed - the room was nice, the extra fee not so much.

It cost us 900 euro including breakfast from the webste GTA hotels. On arrival we were asked if we would like to upgrade to a superior room for 60 pounds extra for the four nights and did so. The best thing about the superior room is the fabulously large bed, though probably for London standards, the room was spacious enough if a little tight on storage facilities. I found the air stuffy though and when I opened the windows the noise from the construction of two large blocks right next door was really annoying (we were on the third floor). Somewhat muffled, with the window closed. When we asked to be changed, we were moved to another room the next day (although I put the request in straight away on the day of arrival). Noise was still there during the day if window open, though not as bad. With window closed hardly noticeable. (room 402). This is right in the middle of a busy urban area so dont expect the views to be pretty!!! Neither issues a big problem if you are gone all day sightseeing anyway. A nice touch is the bottle of bubbly in the room after arrival, though WATCH OUT for the mini bar. We had no interest in using it, but when my husband just picked up a bottle (or maybe two) to look at, out of curiosity, we noticed they were on a magnetic pad sort of thing. Just lifting the bottle ALONE, COSTS. We had to sign something at reception when they tried to charge us 13 pounds for 'using the mini bar'. That was a new one on us...:-(( Also watch out for the hotel bar Longfords - there is a 12 and a half per cent service charge included in your tab. We didn't realise this and had tipped generously on top of that. Ambience is nice there with a good jazz singer/pianist. We treated ourselves to the Spanish restaurant L'Albufera, one night. Coupons were given at reception for a reduction but this only appies to the a la carte and not to the chef's set menu which we had (35 pounds each for three courses). (The service charge is also included here whether you like it or not. ) The food was good and the service and ambience classy. This was on a Wednesday night. Worth dressing up for. The breakfast is buffet style and there is a wide selection - could set you up for the day, though my husband cringed when he heard some US guests (who must have only booked a room) being asked to fork out 21 pounds for the pleasure, (way overpriced in my opinion especially when you also consider the dollar exchange rate). SO, at the end of the day, yea, I'd recommend staying here - also because it is so convenient to the tube stations (Great Portland Street the nearest) and walkable to Regents Street, Tottenham Court Road etc. BUT it depends on your budget and since we have very little experience of staying in London, we can't compare it to other hotels price-wise.", "Date": "September 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Farnborough UK", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay\u201d", "Author": "EllePJ", "ReviewID": "UR20341387", "Content": "We stayed 2 nights at the Melia White house in september.

You expect some road noise being in the centre of London but the noise was that bad that at 3am I asked to be moved. We were moved to a smaller room on the opposite side of the building and I eventually slept until 7am when I was woken by the construction workers commencing work on the building opposite. When complaining at reception, after they had translated my complaint as no one seemed to speak English, I was transferred to another room later that day. No apology or understanding from staff and I had to ask about the refund for the upgrade, which they said I would receive on checking out. This executive room was much better and \u00c2\u00a330 cheaper a night than the junior suite. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waste your money with the upgrade. My friends had booked another room and had the same issue but also found a gigantic hair ball in the middle of the floor. It looked like someone had empted their hair brush after a years brushing on their carpet.

However they were limited to choice, bells whiskey, no brandy or liquors, there was a small amount of vodka in one bottle the first night which was not replaced. When I asked the bell boy about obtaining a taxi, he just shrugged his shoulders (probably didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak English). I ordered a black Russian cocktail in the bar one night (tia maria, vodka, coke) and received a white Russian (similar but has fresh cream on top). When I explained the error the waiter said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that different, can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you drink it?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 I had to explain that I am allergic to milk, cream etc and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t what I had ordered. I did receive my black Russian eventually but I was made to feel most uncomfortable. I thought I would try and let the hotel redeem itself and ordered two aromatherapy pillows one evening. I rang room service to order as instructed but requested the pillows be delivered later that evening as I was about to slip in a nice warm bath. I placed my \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdo not disturb\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the door and climbed into the bath. Needless to say five minutes later there was several knocks at my door.

The hotel deputy manager was called who came and said ok to my reduction from changing my room from a junior suite to an executive room; however he debated that I did sleep some part of the first night in the junior suite!

He stated that housekeeping had no right to offer a refund without his authority and he knew nothing about it. He just left no apology.

The hotel and area: Location was great. You're just 2 minutes away from the tube, the surrounding area is mainly embasseys, expensive appartments and businesses. Hence the chance of running into a mob of drunk kids is minimal. Oxford st. is a bit of a walk, but it's a nice walk and unless you're carrying kids or heavy bags it should be no problem. 5 minutes walk will get you to a business area with loads of small restaurants and pubs catering lunch to hungry suits.

Some of them look a bit on the dirty side, but as a rule of thumb: If the place is packed it is usually worth the wait, since most of the customers are probably regulars. Breakfast at the hotel was overwhelming. Cook to order omlettes, a wide selection of cold and warm meat, loads of fresh fruit, good coffee, decent pastries and for the morning buzz, a lovely cava. We did not try the wine for breakfast, but it is there, should you desire it. The staff: The service was for the most part simply outstanding! The desk was able to answer any and all questions we had and gave us great advice on pubs and... donut-stores (yes, we had a craving!) They stored 3 dosins of donuts for us in the kitchen fridge, as the guestfridge was too small - Free of charge! Service was fast and spotless at the desk. In the restaurant it's more so-so. We had a late night dinner in the restaurant, just before closing, and service was incredible slow. The food was quite nice and worth the wait, but for a quick meal there was nothing quick about it.

The breakfast buffet was fairly good but a little bit short in terms of choice. Location is good but not great (20 min. walk to Picaddilly for instance); nevertheless, the Great Portand Street circle line tube station is a stone's throw away and is very convenient to sightsee or get to transport hubs such as Victoria Station, Paddington, etc. I got a minor issue with the Internet connection as the mini IR keyboard they supply was not working and could not navigate. On check out I stated this and the charge was not added to my acoount, which was great of course. The worst thing this hotel has are the lifters. They look ultra-modern at first sight but it itakes *forever* to get to your floor. It can get up to 5 minutes!

There was one occasion where it did take a while for the baked beans to be refilled, but it was extremely busy and the staff just didn't stop, (very professional) so it was understandable that it would take a few minutes longer.

Thanks to London Discount Hotels, we got a decent rate (considering our dollar is worth half of the British pound) but I would caution you to get in writing from them that the breakfasts for you and whomever shares your room is included in the price you paid London Discount Hotel. I say this because the hotel tries to charge you and at 21 pounds ($42 US) per person each day if you don't so this is certainly something to work out ahead of time. I had been warned about this by a friend who stayed there and got proof ahead of time in writing from London Discount Hotels so every time the staff tried to charge us, I kept having to pull out the proof -- annoying when you're staying there almost a week but we were very happy to have had the heads up. That said, the breakfast is really generous with choices for every taste from croissants to breads, scrambled and sunny side up eggs, English bacon and sausages, yogurt, cereals and even cold cuts and fresh juices. If you're staying at the hotel, it is really a great deal to get it included each day as you'll eat enough to skip lunch and have some nice scones and tea later in the day before a late dinner. The Spanish staff (It's a Spanish hotel) weren't the best when it came to service but once they saw we tipped generously (for good service only of course), service improved. They must know of the terrible exchange rate Americans get and are wary of them because of smaller tips but we just sucked it up and tried not to think that everytime we tipped someone it was between $4-$10. They offered us an upgrade for an additional cost and when we declined it, they improved the cost so we did upgrade one level up from the basic room. I've heard their basic room is nice but extremely small so I wasn't surprised when their \"upgrade\" gave us a room that was smaller than a US room but big enough for two people to be comfortable and have a desk and two chairs in it as well. The tv is international with a great selection of channels from Europe and the Middle East -- really nice to see how the rest of the world watches. The rooms are decorated beautifully (soft pillows and really nice linens) and the hallways are done with wood panelling that almost gives you the feel you're on a luxury cruise. Our bathroom was a symphony in black and tan marble but the shower/bath thingy they use there (which includes a weird swinging glass door) tended to leak all over the floor no matter how much you tried not to so be sure to tip the housekeeping staff each day and ask for extra towels. We did make use of the business center to check emails each day (using a machine where you insert pound coins for 10 minute increments but be aware, it took at least 4 times as long for me to do anything on that computer as my dsl at home -- no doubt because they are charging by the minute it isn't in their best interests to provide quick dsl-type service.) And the staff in the business center were pleasant and helpful. The hotel also made sure to include a little card with our hotel keys explaining how they noticed we'd booked through a discounter and how they can guarantee the same rates -- I don't believe that for a second and was very pleased with the service I received from London Discount Hotels in booking this trip. They were really great and I'd recommend them unhesitatingly. My husband and I would definitely stay at this hotel again. It was really nice.

No matter the time of day, staff can be found dusting and polishing in the corridors and public areas. The rooms are also cleaned to the same high standards. This is indeed a \"classy\" hotel with rich carpeting and tasteful decoration throughout. Add to this the polite and friendly staff and you have a very fine hotel indeed, so why did it not earn top marks? First, the bedroom. Ours was a Classic room (which is a standard room) and it had very little space, possibly made worse by the fact that we asked for twin beds. It was very narrow and the space between the ends of the beds and the wall was only 60cm (2 feet), with the space between the edge of one bed and the wardrobe being the same. Access to the wardrobe was not easy and it was a case of \"breathe in\" before passing alongside the beds! Having said this, it was well furnished, provided everything that was needed and the beds were very comfortable, but it was a tight squeeze. In my view it would be ideal for single occupancy but hopeless for two people with larger than average build. Next time we shall pay for a more spacious Superior room for which prices for upgrade start at GBP 30, even though we are of average build. Second, the bathroom. This was really compact and had a very small washbowl, but did provide everything that was needed, including an efficient shower over the bath, and constant hot water. However the bath itself, which was deep, did cause problems because it was enclosed on three and a half sides, leaving little space for access. It was impossible to reach the taps and let the water run hot, without first scrambling into the bath, so the water that flowed for the first minute or so was cold. I fear that this difficult access would present a real problem for anyone who is elderly, of heavy build or less than mobile. Third, the buffet breakfast. This provided an excellent selection of quality hot and cold foods and wonderful orange juice, but so it should at GBP 21 for guests on a room only basis! However, the \"hot food\" was seldom that, being at best luke warm. A fresh tray of scrambled eggs brought straight from the kitchen by a chef was as cold as steel. He must surely have known this when he was carrying it. We soon discovered that the only way to ensure that the food was hot was to order an omellete and wait while the chef prepared it. Fourth, the in-room guest information booklet. On-the-ball management would ensure that this is up-to-date at all times. Having checked-in mid afternoon, we thought that it would be nice to have \"English Afternoon Tea\" with sandwiches, scones and pastries served every day from 3pm - 6pm in Longfords Bar, only to be told by a waitress when we got there that this has not been served for 6 months and more. We then proceeded to The Place where light meals are served 7 days a week from 12.30pm - 10.30pm, to find a notice telling us that The Place opened at 6pm and directing us to a coffee kiosk where we could have \"supermarket type\" pre-wrapped sandwiches, the price of which we didn't bother to ask. We could, of course, have ordered from \"Room Service\" and enjoyed a bowl of Onion Soup for GBP 9.56 or a Club Sandwich for GBP 16.31 (including service charge) but since we were not business people on an expense account we decided against this option. The Green Man Pub, 2 minutes walk away and alongside Great Portland Street tube station, provided some excellent food for GBP 7.50 each!! We shall be happy to stay in this hotel on a future occasion, now that we know we must book a Superior Room to enjoy a bit of space and, hopefully, a more spacious bathroom with a bath that has much less precarious access.

We had requested a Queen bed, but forgotten to mention that we'd do a late check-in. When we arrived, the friendly receptionist asked if we wanted an upgrade. We decided not to have it, as it cost \u00c2\u00a325 per night, and we were staying for so many nights. I think they had hoped we'd agree to upgrade, as there wasn't any rooms with Queen beds left for us! It was the only thing we requested, but they still couldn't fulfil it. We gave the receptionist a disappointed glance and agreed to take a twin room for our first night, and then switch to a room with a queen bed the next day. So we got our key cards, and went to find our room. When we arrived at the room, we heard the phone ringing inside. We didn't open the door quick enough to answer it, but then someone knocked at the door. It was the receptionist, and she appologized for the inconvenience, but one of the other receptionists had checked in a family who were to have two rooms, and only marked one room in their database. So, as they'd messed up twice, we got an upgrade for free. Yey! So we were a lot happier. The room we got had a huge bed, quite a lot of space and was nicely decorated. There was a small cupboard with mirrors. The bath room wasn't huge, but still a good size. There was a glass door over the bathtub, so no water on the floor after showers. It was a bit dark though, but not too bad. Had one robe and one pair of slippers, but didn't use it so no problems there. The only problem with our room was the air conditioning. It was either too cold or too warm. If we left it at 22 C, it felt as if it varied between 17C and 25C. When we wanted it a bit more than the freezing 17C, warm air came out of the vents almost at ceiling level. So that meant having a room where the top half was too warm, and the bottom half too cold... Not too happy about that. Our feelings for the staff were mixed. The waiters at the cafe styled restaurant were very friendly. The receptionists, concierges and bell hops were sometimes a bit cold and not very service minded. The maids forgot to replace the face cloths in the bathroom, but when I happened to mention it to the Maid manager one day, she made sure I had all the face cloths I wanted. People staying at this hotel should be aware of two things: The mini bar is weight sensitive, and will report that things have been removed just because you moved the bottles around. You need to pay \u00c2\u00a35 per night to use the mini bar! Also, there's a construction site very close by, and it didn't look as if it was to be finished in 2007. It's quite noisy!

I reminded the receptionist that i had emailed ahead asking for a king room and an interconnecting twin room, for my teenage son and daughter, which the hotel had acknowledged and i produced the email. I was checked into two king rooms next door to each other. I had to get the rooms changed even though i had pointed all this out initially at check in. The receptionist apologised and said they didn't have any king/twin interconnecting rooms. I asked why the email reply had said that the request had been noted and that there had been no mention that this was not possible. She didn't know the answer so my initial introduction to the hotel was, to say the least, frustrating. Rooms were allocated on the same floor but a long way apart on different corridors, not ideal but we seemed to have no other option. The standard rooms ARE very small as has been previously mentioned but the rooms were very smart, comfortable and clean. The bathrooms were also very small but both the bedrooms and bathrooms provided everything one needed in such a small space. The air conditioning was very efficient. I could hear people talking in the room next to me but don't know if they were just loud or whether the walls are thin. We liked the 'feel of Spain' throughout the hotel and found the staff to be very friendly. We had breakfast because we are MaS card holders and if you book a room only rate you can get two breakfasts for the price of one if there are two of you staying in a room. The breakfast is \u00c2\u00a320 each but for 4 of us (2x MaS card holders) we paid \u00c2\u00a340 which of course worked out at \u00c2\u00a310 each which wasn't too bad. We requested advice on their food items as one of our party has a serious allergy and they said they couldn't be sure about any of the things we queried. This didn't give us a lot to go on so our allergy sufferer ate very little. (There are cafes nearby which do cheaper breakfasts). The quality of the breakfast items was very good and there was a good choice. Overall we liked the hotel but would only stay again if we got a good rate.

I definitely do not think it was worth it. We took the Royal Service option which had a seperate check in desk but he only found this after he had queued at the main desk for 15 minutes! The hotel is situated right beside a tube station so it is very hand for travel around the city. The room left a lot to be desired, we had requested a king bed but got two small singles with a large piller between them so no change of pulling them together, and believe me they were small singles. A table had been placed beside one of the beds that meant you could only get out one side so we moved the table under the desk (the maid continued to move it back each day which was extremely frustrating!). The room itself is extremely small and if this was a Royal Service special room I hate to think what the standard double is like. The bathroom has to be the worst we have ever had. The bath was situated in a long dark corridor and you had to climb over the edge to get into the shower which was at the far end of the dark corridor. It has to be seen to be believed. If you were elderly or infirm there is no way you could have got in to use it. It is extremely dangerous and I am amazed they get away with using these rooms. The rest of the bathroom was very small. We got one pair of slippers and on the last day they finally left out a second pair. No robes. The breakfast was in the Royal Service lounge and was a full buffet but it was dreadful. Cold every day. Even when the new fried eggs would come out they would be freezing. We complained each morning and each time they said thank you for bringing it to their attention but did nothing. The main breakfast area for the rest of the hotel must be where the other reviewers had their breakfast as I can not reconcile our visit with their rave reviews. The staff found it hard to understand us as they are all spanish, we did not meet one english staff member in all our stay there. I know it is a spanish chain hotel but we would have expected to have some english staff working there. There was a constant stream of spanish visitors staying and they all spoke with the staff in spanish very loudly. Not quite what we had expected in the centre of London. The lounge area is spacious and we visited it a number of evenings. The alcholic drink is free and there are some hot nibbles left out on the buffet to tempt you. Finally, there are large construction works happening next door to the hotel and the noise is unbelievable from 8am each morning right through until 6pm. The hotel does not mention this anywhere on their website but be prepared. If you want to stay in your room during the day, you won't be able to due to the noise. Luckily they did not work on Sunday so we had one day of silence!

The standard rooms are very small, there is just enough space to get past the bed (about 18 inches from the foot of the bed to the ajoining wall). The bathroom could be a struggle for a person of 'generous' proportions getting in and out of the shower (over bath) will be a problem if you are elderly and the floors are very slippery if you have wet feet. Noise from your neighbours and the traffic are very noticable, one night I had to leave my tv on (to get to sleep) to stop me hearing the people in the next room, not that they were over noisy, its just the walls are not soundproof and you hear lots!! One of the selling points of the deluxe rooms is they are soundproofed, something you may want to think about. The chain, I believe, is a Spanish one and consequently attracts a large number of guests from Spain and Portugal where smoking is more common, so I was not surprised to see the number of smokers puffing away in the public areas. Its funny how you get used to a smoke free atmosphere and how you notice when its not. Getting there can be easy if you are coming from Heathrow, tubes and trains make it a simple journey, from Gatwick is a bit more complicated so study the tube maps carefully. London underground can be very expensive for one way travel, buy a day pass it's a much better deal. Breakfast was included with the room and there is plenty of choice, you can have full English or you can have European style meats cheese pastries etc. However the English food was often cold by the time you got to eat it. The cleanliness of the rooms and the friendliness of the staff is second to none, they always had a smile for you and always spoke to you when you passed. I liked the lifts (once you get used to them). Walking time to the shops (Oxford Street) is about 15 minutes, but the tube is not on a convienent line for most attractions so you either need to walk to Warren Street (about 10 mins) or change once you are on the system). Oxford street is like any other high street in the UK all the brands are there so it may not be you choice if you want to see something different, it is close to Liberty's and Carnaby Street however. All in all I may stay at this hotel again but definately not in a standard room, you can ask at the desk for an upgrade they sell them from \u00c2\u00a325 (wether that is per room or person I do not know) I wish I had. But it is clean it is very friendly and it is a short walk away from lots of the touristy bits and it is right next to a tube station, and it is a good price for a central London hotel.", "Date": "March 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, lovely hotel.\u201d", "Author": "cardmanuk", "ReviewID": "UR7011722", "Content": "We bought tickets to go and see the musical Billy Ellliot for Saturday 10th March and wanted to stay in a hotel that was better than a budget hotel without being charged a fortune.

It is newly renovated, classically decorated, clean and cozy. It's right across the street from an underground stop, a bus stop, and right out the door is Regents Park, which is great for running or just strolling. There is a pull-up driveway, door men, bell hops -- the works. When you enter the rather grand lobby, it is always full of smoke, but remember that is somewhat the norm in London. Once we were in our room, we did not hear a thing from neighboring rooms or outside. It helps that the hotel is set back a little bit from the major street it is on. And room darkening shades do a good job keeping out the street lights. One glitch upon arrival was that I had emailed ahead to guarantee a non-smoking room, to which they replied it was all set, but once we got there they said they had no non-smoking rooms. They arranged for one within about 20 min., but we consider ourselves lucky with that one. If you're looking for a place that is not right in the center of action (which would also be much more expensive), this is a great place. From here, you can walk to shopping on Oxford Street and the tourist spots on Baker Street and in Mayfair. Great for exploring by foot - and to go beyond, it's easy to catch a train or bus. We had a great experience on our brief trip to London and were able to fit it all in, with this hotel as our base.

To be fair, they did apologise for keeping us waiting. The lift service is, frankly, bizarre - you tell the system where you're going through a central control panel, which then assigns you a lift. Once you've entered your floor, that's it - there's no way to punch in a different number once it arrives. I suspect the idea is meant to be efficient, to stop several lifts heading for the same floor at the same time, which might make sense in a skyscraper. In a seven story building, it doesn't work - it's slow, glitchy, and created a knot of confused people stood around trying to work out how to get up and down. In fact, going down for breakfast there were so many people stood hoping for a lift to show up on our floor that we decided to go down the stairs instead. We were already on our cereals before the others made it into the breakfast room. The room was clean, in good condition (some slight damp coming through from the shower, a bit of ripped wallpaper, but nothing seriously wrong) but the bath is very high, very deep and very narrow - wouldn't recommend it for people who have mobility problems, and not for people who like baths. There's a list of relaxing bath salts available, but how relaxing a bath would be if you had to take it on your side, I'm not sure. We had to fix our TV - we got no picture - the aerial had come out the back. (I'm aware some TA users mark down on this sort of thing.) And why a one hundred quid a night hotel feels it can get away with providing standard Nescafe in the rooms - a drink that bears only a passing relationship with coffee - I'll never understand. Although just off Marleybone Road, the double glazing keeps the sound out, but not, unfortunately, the noise of the couple in the next room having sex. That didn't last that long - good for us, slightly disappointing for them, I fear. Breakfast had a wide selection of foods on the buffet, although the scrambled eggs were so liquid as to count as a drink and the range of jams was limited to a choice of two; they served up until 10.30 which is pretty good by UK standards.

We were given a king bed room on the 3rd floor - no smoking. It was the room adjacent to the elevators. Caution if the sound of elevator cables is likely to disturb your sleep - change rooms as it is noisy in the mornings particularly. The king bed was extremely comfortable. Duvet rather than blankets. Plenty of space to store luggage underneath which is a plus as there really isnt adequate closet space and virtually no useful drawer space. The bathroom was a closet size room. Adequate for one person at a time. Room service was a bit hit and miss. While the room was cleaned and linen changed the room person left the window in the room open all day on three occasions! These were on the three coldest nights in Feb when it had snowed. After 2 calls to Room service and eventually spoke to the Duty manager - this didnt happen again. We requested ice one evening and when it hadnt arrived after 45mins, cancelled it. Apologies were offered but it wasnt great service as this hotel does not have floor ice machines. Internet service is outrageously expensive at 9.99 gbp ($20) per hour or 30 gbp ($60 which covers internet and inhouse movies) for a 24 hour period. The room does have a mini bar at the usual inflated prices if you want the minibar cleared for your own use it costs 15 gbp ($30) per day. The window sill worked well as a place to keep drinks/yogurts during our stay in Feb. The tube station - Gt Portland Street is 2 blocks from the hotel. The bus stop outside this station has three buses to Baker Street station. Get an Oyster card if you plan to use tube and buses as it is double the cost if you dont use one. They are available in tube stations and some Newsagents shops. When topping up buy the Weekly Oyster pass as it will save you a lot of money. Tescos metro store is close by Gt Portland St Station open 7am to midnight. A Pret a manger is a few stores down. Both are excellent for breakfast supplies. Check in and check out was very efficient and quick. We had arrived at 8am and were given a room immediately. Coffee shop - Davidoff Cafe produced excellent coffee 1.80gbp per cup.

We got to the hotel around 2:30pm and we got checked in right away. Got to our room and was quite surprised at how tiny the room is for a supposed \"Junior Suite\" that we paid for. It didn't look like a junior suite but I took that as it's simply because rooms in Europe are typically smaller. But anyhow, it looked a lot smaller from the pictures and virtual tours shown for junior suite rooms. Our room had a king size bed and a sofa bed. The room was too cramped for 3 skinny people and our luggage. You can bounce from one wall to the other. We didn't take the upgrade simply because we were already supposed to be in a Junior Suite and our deal already included breakfast so whatever deal came with the upgrade was worth paying for more. In any case, our first night, my friend woke up at like 2am and asked if we can hear something dripping and yes I heard it, but I was too sleepy to investigate and we had to wake up early that day to catch an early tour so I went back to sleep. But then the following night when we got back to our hotel, I noticed there was a puddle of wet spot right next to the sofabed. It came from the roof, there was a leak! That was what the dripping noise was. So at this time, it was already past midnight so I just called the front desk and let them know about this leak. A guy came up to our room and inspected it and he said he'll go downstairs and talk to the manager on duty. Btw, this is when we found out that there is another class of junior suite rooms that is bigger than what we got! In any case, the guy then called us in our room and said we will be transferred to another room the following day. We just needed to go to the reception in the morning and tell them to change our room. So we did that in the morning after breakfast around 9am and had already packed our stuff ready for the move. So we told them, we weren't in a rush, but we just need to make that our stuff be moved to the new room by the time we get back to our hotel by 4pm since we needed to get ready for a show that evening. So we get back to our hotel around 5pm, and nothing was done! Because they only thought we were after the bigger sized junior suite and that is why we asked to be moved. So at this point, we already had someone checked our room the night before and verified the leak, we had already informed the front desk in the morning, so now this is the 3rd time I had to tell someone we had a leak and had to be moved. So the guy at the front desk told us they couldn't move us because they were fully booked and they didn't have another bigger room available. So now I'm freaking irritated, I had to tell him at this point I didnt care about the bigger room, we simply just needed to be moved to a room without the dripping noise and the leak and the bigger junior suite would just have been a bonus. So sure enough, at this point my voice was already raised, my two friends were just as annoyed, and all of a sudden, what a surprise, not even a minute later they found us another room. Well, well, well, we got another junior suite, but this time it was slightly bigger! This is the size of room we had originally thought we paid for! But just to get our problem taken care of, I had to be nasty and confrontational because being nice the previous 2 attempts, apparently fell into deaf ears. The people at the front desk were quite stuffy. The concierge, however, was very friendly and accommodating to us when we had questions. The room had a mini fridge that was so packed you couldn't fit anything there anyways. And if you did attempt to store personal items there, they charge you 15 pounds!!! So we asked for a mini personal fridge coz they said it would be free if we ask that from room service. What a joke! They brought us what looked like a cooler, we nearly died laughing when we saw this, it could only fit 2 soda cans. It won't even fit a snapple bottle even if you tilt it sideways! That's how small this \"mini fridge\" on loan was. The bathroom was miniscule. The only good thing was the towel warmer. The tub was so high off the ground that if you were short like me and my friend, you pretty much have to climb up in there. Our other friend is taller (5'9) but she even complained about it as well. The swinging tub door that only covered half of the tub wasn't a surprise since we had the same thing at a hotel in Melbourne, Australia when we went last year. But it can get tricky to take a shower in there without flooding the entire. bathroom since it was freaking tiny anyways. You practically have to shower facing the other way so that the water won't get out and splash all over the bathroom. The breakfast was great, but I won't necessarily pay the 18.50 pounds they charge for it if it wasn't already included in our hotel deal (we booked our trip via AA Vacations). The room service was exhorbitant as expected and the prices at the restaurants are just as outrageous. So if you want snacks and goodies, there's a Tesco right around the corner and you can get some food there. There's also a line of restaurants within walking distance from the hotel and the concierge can point you how to get there. The location itself isn't in the center of the crowded tourist spot, which I like since it was more quiet, but it's very close to everything that you can walk or take a short cab ride, or take the tube or bus to get to Picadilly, Oxford, Bond street area for shopping. All other usual tourist attractions are so close that the location isn't a problem at all. Like: Location, Concierge, Breakfast, Doorman Disliked: Front Desk (rude and terrible service overall); Terrible Customer Service by the Hotel Management Tips: There's a Tesco nearby to buy snacks and goodies from, and a line of restaurants within walking distance to eat at. Beware when you ask the hotel to book you a cab, you have to be specific, tell them to book you a \"Black Taxi Cab\" and not a \"mini cab.\" Mini cabs are not metered and you have to negotiate the price before you get in and decide to go.", "Date": "October 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cTwo classes of rooms\u201d", "Author": "Tosher", "ReviewID": "UR5884762", "Content": "Booked Melia White House online through a discount agency.

Boy, did we feel we were taken advantage of and misled. We had no choice but to upgrade as we needed a handicap accessibile room for a family member and they are limited in London and staying in the original room for six nights was not an option. The deluxe room was lovely and what we expected in the first place. The hotel is located in a business area and after 6 pm no one is out on the streets. You'll have to travel to all standard \"tourist\" sites and old fasion english neighborhoods. I'm a walker so heading out for Mayfair and Covent Garden etc was okay for me and I didn't mind the walk.

We originally paid about $118 a night for the hotel, the upgrade was 25 pounds, a little less than $50, and still a very good deal for under $200 a night. The cheaper room was very small. The bed was short, my husband is only 5'9\" and his feet hung over the edge. The room is not very wide and I believe the normal length bed would probably almost hit the wall and would be too long for the room. The bathroom is about the size of an airplane bathroom, very small. But if you just want a place to sleep I suppose it would be fine. The room was clean and decorated nicely. The upgraded room, which on their website is the gold and red room was very nice. The bed was a large king size (and the length was the correct size) and very comfortable. The bathroom was a good size and comfortable. The closet was larger. The room was very nice and very comfortable and clean. The upgrade was worth it. We did not go for the breakfast included rate.

There are 4 elevators, a set of 2 on each side of a divider. At the divider you press the button of the floor you want and it will tell you which elevator to go to. The elevator does not have buttons inside to push, it's done outside the elevator. We did not have a problem at all. The elevators were quick and took us to our floor with no problems.

There is a great service mentality at this hotel and I would go back there. We are not that easily pleased as we travel nearly every month but I would recommend this place because of the warm welcome, the people they employ and the feel of the hotel. It felt a little continental ( lots of Spanish guests too ). The room was clean, not huge but fine, tv all good ( tucked away in a TV cupboard ) and the bed was the biggest bed I have ever seen!!! I think it's called a california king size. It was cool. Anyhow, we were so comfortable and despite being at the front of the hotel got a great night's sleep. It wasn't noisy. The only down side was the mini bar - silly prices - so we went to the bar itself. The bar on the ground floor had piano music and a singer in the bar for some of Saturday night and this was just great background, not overwhelming. The bar prices were reasonable for London and we had a few snacks there. They bring nibbles ( nuts and rice crackers ) as standard. We found that a large area of the bar was reserved by a group for late night drinks so you might want to reserve your own table. Gt Portland St tube is right on your doorstep. Unfortunately this wasn't open the weekend we were there ( some lines weren't running ...engineering works! ) but we walked everywhere and found things easily. If you want to go out for breakfast there are loads of good places nearby - take the main streets and you will find all sorts.

We found the hotel incredibly easily, it is located over the road from Great Portland Street Tube, and only a few more minutes walk from Regents Park Tube. The hotel is lavishly decorated; the check-in desk is manned with very friendly and helpful staff who spoke perfect English even though they were Spanish. We knew what we were getting; we had paid for the deluxe room, and it surpassed our expectations. Other reviews have mentioned that the rooms are slightly small, I personally thought the bathroom could have been a tad bigger but, the room was perfectly formed and featured a huge 7ft king size bed, of which we had the most enjoyable sleep. We had our breakfast in the Royal Suite one of the three hotel restaurants, this was half buffet service and half table service, everything from champagne to specialist sausages were made available, for a superb continental breakfast two a full English, staff were very helpful and efficient.

There are two convient stores down the street that we frequented every night because the places nearby stopped serving food after 10.

You also had to step up into the shower and step out and down which could be very dangerous for older people.

I wasnt. I even emailed ahead, in light of the comments about noisy rooms, asking for a quiet room. I'm not sure if they didnt understand my request or deliberately put us in room 328 next to the lift shaft but it was the worst 2 nights sleep i have ever had. There were no rooms available for upgrade even with the MAS 'reward' card. The only reward it seemed to get us was a free newspaper, and a half price breakfast, which at over \u00c2\u00a318 a head is hardly a bargain. To get \u00c2\u00a318 worth of breakfast you would have to get there at 7 a.m. and keep eating till 11 a.m.Our room was small, noisy, and had the shortest bed i have ever seen. I am not tall (5' 6\") and my feet were hanging over the edge. There was a bottle of cava left in our room 'with compliments' - i'm not sure what it was supposed to be for - possibly that if we were drunk we wouldnt notice that when the person in the next room had a shower we both thought it was in our room. There was a menu of bath salts you can order from for a relaxing bath - what a joke, anyone over 4' tall wouldnt fit in the bath let alone relax in it. If you should dare open the min bar and want to store anything of your own in it they charge you \u00c2\u00a315. My advice to this chain of hotels is focus a little less on the acres of gilt and faux marble and a bit more on actually making the standard rooms, exactly that, of a good standard.

We had to push the open door button, get out of the elevator, push our floor number on the outside pad and then step back into the elevator.

I have to agree. These mattresses were the absolute worst I have stayed on in London in the past 25 years. They reminded me of the $40 mattresses I bought at Ikea for my kids beds (until they were potty trained). Others have noted that the soundproofing was good in the hotel. I would have to disagree. The room next to us was occupied for only one night and at 4:00 that night, the couple had a really good fight which we could hear every word of.

They could not be closed all the way, the latch wouldn't close so there was a little crack.

I got a deal off of Hotwire and I was determined not to get stuck with \"the hotwire room.\" Because I paid significantly less by using Hotwire I was sure that I would have the crappy room next to the elevator or with a window staring at a brick wall. But luckily that was not the case, our room was small, but overlooked the traffic circle outside the hotel and we were able to see the snow falling in the early morning. Good things about the hotel... -The room is small, but its LONDON and its cozy and it has everything you need a bed, a toilet, a tv, and a shower(plus a North American adapted plug) -A staff that was professional and respectable (to us at least) -Location was nice, walking distance to everything. Negatives About the hotel... -The bed could have been a little more comfortable, and the walls could have been a little thicker (you can hear your neighbors TV) -A continental breakfast for 17 pounds (around $30) is like a $40 pizza...it's cannot be worth it -Oh and just in case... The four cheese pizza from Room Service (when everything else is closed)...the worst combinations of cheeses I have ever witnessed. In conclusion, I was nervous upon arrival as I searched every hotel (in the $100 a night range) I saw on trip advisor, but it suited us fine. It is London, wake up and leave in the morning and come back and go to sleep, that is all you need. I will say though, if I had spent $300 a night for this I would be crying!!!

I have stayed at Melia hotels before and have generally found the accommodations to be very nice. The Melia White House was no exception in certain areas. I loved the location. Three tube stations offering different tube lines were within walking distance. I only made a change of trains once. Nearly everything can be reached directly if you walk to the correct station. In addition, you can walk into SOHO easily on foot. The hotel was in excellent shape and the room had four star features. Yes, it was probably small compared to other cities, but more than adequate for a London hotel. The elevators are lightening fast using a system I had never seen before. You select your floor from a touchscreen and then it will tell you which elevator to take. So, we're clearly at a minimum of four stars UNTIL YOU REACH THE S-WORD. I mean Service. I tried calling reception from my room several times and the staff rarely answers. On the day before my scheduled check-out, my key card stopped working. I used the phone next to the elevators on my floor to call reception. No answer. I then called the Consierge. He refused to assist or send anyone to let me in or bring new cards. He insisted that come down to the lobby. I did so and went to the consierge desk. He then told me I would have to wait in the long line of check-ins to get new cards. I told him that was not acceptable and requested that he simply obtain new cards for me by visiting the reception. I pointed out that this was not my error. He refused, so I asked for a manager. Several minutes later, an assistant manager showed up and acknowledged that the consierge should have done more to help. He was apologetic and took care of the problem. My point is this. Why was all of that necessary at a four star hotel? And why is reception unavailable? Clearly, this is a three star facility due to SERVICE. Otherwise, it's a beautiful hotel in a grand location. I got an EXCELLENT deal on the hotel via Hotwire.com ($103 per night) so I am very happy overall. I would stay there again anytime at a similar rate.

When you check in, you're asked whether you'd like to upgrade to a \"larger and more comfortable room\" for 20 pounds. That sounds like a good deal, but if you're just there to have a good night's sleep, a larger room doesn't do much for you. I declined the upgrade. The room was small with two twin beds; it had a comfortable feel to it and looked good. The mattresses were among the worst I have encountered in 15 years of business travel (creaky, unsupportive, you could feel the springs). The pillows were about 3 inches thick and felt like foam. The last time I've had mattresses this bad was in Crete, where we checked into a hotel late at night without having done any research. At 4 a.m., after having tried for more than 3 hours to fall asleep, but finding the mattresses impossible to get comfortable on (and becoming increasingly angry, with visions of dragging the mattress into the hotel's reception area in the morning), I spoke to the night manager. He handled the matter well, and immediately switched me to what I now assume is the room I would have had with the 20 pound upgrade. This room had proper mattresses, a proper douvet, and comfortable pillows. I ended up having 4 hours of sleep. Smart hotel chains are starting to wise up to the fact (the primordial brain is evolving) that most customers expect a good night's sleep, and that proper mattresses and bedding play a significant role in this. Hotels that offer two levels of service under the same brand... well, I just don't get it. So... if you book with Hotwire, either go for the 20 pound upgrade, or take a chance and get the 2 star mattress room. I'd suggest complaining about the mattress sooner than I did.

I paid $125 a night through Hotwire, which was great, but this hotel was NOT 4 stars. Considering that Hotwire rates the Paris InterContinental 4 stars [where I also stayed], it's outrageous they would put Melia White House on the same level. First of all, maybe I'm too chi-chi, but the beds do NOT have any top sheets! I think that's gross! You just go straight into your covers with zero fresh sheet protection - who knows what other stinky feet have been touching the coverlet. I know the Melia is a Mexican/Latin American chain, but I've been to lots of hotels in South America, and they all had sheets! bathroom amenities: the hairdryer was a joke - a vacuum like relic from the 1950s. The soaps/hair shampoos, etc. were a total generic brand that had no scent and that were all orange in color. At the Paris InterContinental, it was all Moulton Brown. More importantly, hotel management (they're all from South America) likes to give you the runaround with what I call, \"faux-first-class service.\" They try uber-hard to be first class in service with unnecessary pomp such as addressing you as Madame, having a tacky chandeliar in the lobby or a bunch of bellhops in the front, but when push comes to shove and you need extra help, they really don't know how to deal and they'll promise you the world, and then not do anything about it. My word to management: go to a real first class hotel in Europe for training, and then come back, you have NO idea how a real first-class hotel should be. For example, I had an issue with the buffet breakfast [incidentally, it's fantastic] but as the hotel only has one restaurant [which is inferior to begin with since late breakfasters will be rushed out], the buffet ends at 10:30 a.m. If you come in at 10 a.m. and pay full price [$30 US per person], you'll get hosed since they'll start noisily packing up at 10:15. Well, I complained, I definitely did not get my money's worth and the management came over, was trying really hard to be elegant and hospitable, but nonetheless, I was still charged for it and when I complained to upper management, they promised to look into when I left but of course, never heard back from them [although the manager took down my e-mail, phone number, home address, etc.] So, there you have it.

Again, they sold the Melia White House short! On our first morning, we asked where the complimentary breakfast was and were directed toward their only dining room with a sign outside that said the breakfast buffet was 19 pounds per person. I said, \"Oh, no, we want the FREE breakfast,\" but at the Melia, that was it! Eggs, waffles, omlets, pancakes next to an enormous bowl of hot chocolate sauce (whew!); eggs, English breakfast bacon, sandwiches, fruits, piizza, cereals, and on and on and on!

A convenience store (for those aforementioned money saving snacks and fresh fruit) and restaurants are next to the underground station as well.

We had the basic room with 2 twin beds and it was small, but there are other options if it is a concern and you want to spend more money.", "Date": "April 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cWe loved it\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3357864", "Content": "I took my partner to London for a surprise birthday trip and had booked the Melia White House by accident rather than recommendation (a special offer where I booked without knowing the hotel).

We opted to upgrade to a superior room and although the room was slightly small the decor and standard made up for this. Everything was in working order and cleans towels in plentiful suppply. The bar was relaxed, comfortable with superb service and the ideal spot to chill out after a hard days shopping. Although slightly expensive it was no more so than any other 4 star hotel I have stayed at.

It is in a great location and we did have nice walk through the park to get to London Zoo one afternoon! The first time we stayed here we were in a standard room which was better then I ever expected, big & spacious with lovely decor and everything you needed! It was a very comfortable bed with an impressive bathroom - apart from the plug in the bath with I kept closing by accident when showering! But I have also experienced a superior room, which was even larger and still really great! The food in the cafe tasted and looked great and was a really good price! And the evening restaurant was absolutely fabulous. Great food and excellent service throughout! We also enjoy a nice cocktail in the bar before bed. This is very relaxing as there are many big lounge sofas and waiters/waitresses getting everything for you! I was also impressed with up to date lift system they used which seems to work well. The atmosphere here makes you feel like you're really on holiday, a million miles away from busy London! I would reccomend this hotel to anyone, if you don't mind paying the price.

We booked a 'mystery hotel' through lastminute and were pleasantly surprised on arrival at how plush and clean the lobby and rooms were for the price we paid. We were also very appreciative of the friendly Spanish lady on reception who got us into the room 2 hours ahead of check-in time, and good, friendly concierge service. Nothing wrong with the room or service but I subsequently had a bad experience with the special Valentine's Day buffet - food poisoning, apparently from shellfish. The local council has since checked the hotel's procedures and reported all OK, and no other reports of illness apart from mine, but the experience has put me off trying this place again. There was also some sleight-of-hand with the buffet pricing - billed as a (pricey, even for London) \u00c2\u00a335 a head, it turned out that VAT wasn't included and the 'optional' service charge was added to the bill before presentation and easily missed. So the \u00c2\u00a370 bill expected at the door turned into about \u00c2\u00a390 (we did add a drink or two)... We were initially impressed with the comprehensiveness of the breakfast buffet but staff took ages to replace empty platters of eggs and we didn't want to wait. I was also unhappy to get - after we returned home - an extra credit card bill for 'minibar' which we hadn't used but we got that refunded without comment, explanation, apology or the returned phone call we were promised. They did, though, efficiently return an item we left in the room.", "Date": "March 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3228428", "Content": "We stayed at the Melia White House Feb 18-21, 2005 and had a great time.
