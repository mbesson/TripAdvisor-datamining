The first experience was on Saturday we walked to a restaurant on 7th and Osborn Road (about 1.5 miles). The front desk staff told us the shuttle goes within a 3 mile radius and before we left we asked the staff and verified that the shuttle would pick us up. When I called at 8:07pm the receptionist told us it would be about 20 minutes and I verified with her 3 times our location. At 8:30pm we received a call telling us the shuttle was at Safeway \u2013 the one on 3rd and Osborn which was NOT where we were \u2013 she talked with the driver and told us they would be right there. This was the wrong location after I verified 3 times. At 8:38pm we were still waiting and when I called the hotel they told us they would contact the driver to find their location. At 8:47pm I called back and RaLynn told us the shuttle had to go to the convention center. We finally arrived back at the hotel at 9:02pm. Had the receptionist been honest with us, we would have walked. This was unprofessional and unacceptable customer service. The second instance occurred on Wednesday. Once again, we were depending on the shuttle to take us to the airport \u2013 the evening before we departed, we signed up for the 8am shuttle for March 14 (our plane departed at 9:55am). Normally, this would have been plenty of time, but the shuttle driver decided to take 4 people to their meeting destination which was well over the 3 mile radius (30 minutes to/30 minutes from) so we did not arrive to the airport until 9am. We would have missed our flight but luckily the flight had been delayed by 20 minutes. It would have been nice for us to have been dropped off for our flight (priority of missing a flight vs. being a few minutes late for a meeting) and since the shuttle does go to the airport and the other guests\u2019 destination was outside the radius. The shuttle driver did not take any responsibility and there was no apology. I wrote to the hotel manager when I got home and I received what seemed like a canned letter to try and keep my business and gave excueses of why the shuttle service was not working properly. While I am a loyal Marriott reward member and will continue to stay at Marriott properties, I will definitely NOT be visiting this one again.

I love their food. Other than the food, i did notice quite a few homeless folks roaming around. But I guess you're going to see that in any downtown area. It's not that I'm intimidated by them, I just find them kind of depressing to see on vacation. Or anywhere, but anyways. The lobby was nice and so was the front desk staff. They gave us a downstairs room, which I usually don't like. I don't like people over me. I didn't complain though. We were in a hurry to get dressed for the wedding we were going to. Also, the room was right next to two other rooms that they had given a large group of single young women. All I could do is hope that I would get a good nights sleep. The first thing I noticed upon entering the room was the strong smell of mildew. I had already been having trouble with my sinuses and this certainly didn't help. I tried opening the window to air the place out, but it would only crack open. By the time we left for the wedding I was just a big pile of snot in a dress. I had to take almost everything in my arsenal just to make it through the evening. It was miserable. After the wedding I went back to the room to get some rest. First of all the walls and ceiling are paper thin. The people walking over our room sounded like they where stomping accross the floor. That ended around 11 pm, luckily. But then I couldn't sleep, the mattress was hard as a rock and my nose and throat stayed clogged all night. On our way to Phoenix I had begged my hubby to let me sleep in instead of getting up at the butt crack of dawn to leave for San Diego the next day. I ended up waking up before him and our son, tired of trying to get comfortable and get some sleep. It was miserable. Luckily, we only paid $69 plus tax for this room. When my mom went to book at the same hotel, they wanted $20 more just two weeks later. It would not have been worth that.

The Wingate Inn is now called the Fairfied Inn.& Suites (Marriott), Check In was fast and efficient and we were assigned room 205. The room was very clean and it included two queen beds & appropriate furniture. A new twist was the bed spread which was about two and a half feet wide (Indian Design) and it was draped over the sheets. AC was cold to my wife's liking. Free breakfast included cereal, quaker oats, juice, bagels, English muffins, waffles, & fruit. Pool was also excellent for relaxation and it has a small fitness exercise room. Two coin operated washer and dryers (one dollar a load) are located on the third floor. This small hotel is located near the Heard Museum and the Phoenix Theater (complex). We visited the Heard Museum and it is excellent and a true Gem. I took my wife to the Phoenix Theater to see \"Crazy For You\" which is a live broadway musical in an intimate showroom (about 500 seats). The show was very good entertainment. This hotel is located on North Central Ave and construction was going on to build a light mass transit system. However, it did not interfere with our movement around nor did it cause any problem.There was only one problem with parking and it was on Thursday night after the musical show as we arrived to our hotel after 11:00 pm. We could not find a parking space on the property, so I parked in a metered stall adjacent to the hotel and right across IHOP. Since we last ate at about 4:00 PM we decided to eat at IHOP. After dinner I spoke to the manager of IHOP and he indicated that my car was perfectly safe as he himself parks there. In the morning I drove my car back on the property and there were many empty spaces.", "Date": "October 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hertfordshire, UK", "Title": "\u201cNot great\u201d", "Author": "DavidW57", "ReviewID": "UR8590375", "Content": "This hotel is in the middle of being refurbished while its location and the surrounding area are blighted by the construction of a light railway down Central Avenue.

There is free access to high speed internet if you take a lap top. The free access means you can physically touch the USB cord but you must pay the service before using it. I don't know the price because I don't own a lap top. There is Nitendo game controller attached to the television that you can purchase 1 hour of gaming for about $7.95. I didn't look at the pay-per-view movie costs but I am sure it is just as expensive. There is a business center with two computers and a copier. Nothing can be downloaded to these computers unless you have a floppy disk. I had astronomy homework that had to be postponed because no programs can be downloaded at the hotel or the Phoenix Public Library down the street. I didn't want to compute the mass of Jupiter using the orbiting data of it's moons anyway. The free breakfast was filling. Eggs, bacon, make-your-own waffles, milk, juices, coffee, danish, ceral, yogurt,biskits, gravy were all present in the lobby at 6:30 am. No fruits. A U.S today newspaper was at my door as well as bill. I walked around the hotel outside every hour during my stay because it is a non-smoking hotel. The front and back of the hotel is very quiet.
