I never have used the site, but I am really glad I did. We arrived at the hotel around 4:30pm. The valet took our keys and we went to check in. We were greeted and helped right away. The lobby was nice and staff was friendly. They advised us that we came at the right time since they are doing some renovations to the hotel. After going up to our room, there were men working in the hallway quiet loudly. I could hear their saws and hammers. I really just wanted to take a nap after a long boarder line up. There were empty wine glasses on the floor; I thought that was really odd. We turned the corner and our room was tucked in a little hallway. The hallway to the stairs was unfinished and opened. This being my first impression, I was nervous to open the door to our room. When we did, the room was very nice. It was really clean and up to par with cool technology features. (I could plug in my iPod, charge my iPhone, blackberry and GPS) The bed could have used more blankets. But we turned our heat up to accommodate that. :) The room also did smell like fresh paint, but we got use to it. The noise outside stopped around 5:15 and we went downstairs to have a glass of wine. Oh ya, they have happy hour, for free :) We had some wine and were shown a magic trick or two. It was a very nice extra little touch. We walked around the hotel and checked out the other amenities. (The work out room is small but had most of the equipment we were looking for) Then we had a night on the town. We came back from eating and sightseeing to get a little cozy in our room. The showers are very nice and the products they use are not those nasty shampoos that leave your hair dry and only enough for one person to take a shower. They had ample amount! We checked out around 9... Their check out is 12! This is really nice if you just want to lounge. We would stay here again... :)", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wesboro", "Title": "\u201cTerrific Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Elvira P", "ReviewID": "UR127526053", "Content": "We stayed at the Monaco Seattle recently and we are already planning another stay at this hotel.

We've stayed at various Kimpton hotels throughout the country and this did not disappoint. The hotel is currently being renovated and we were a bit worried we would get one of the \"old\" rooms but we did not. Our room was updated, clean, modern and (for the most part) quiet. After looking at the website and reading the reviews on TripAdvisor prior to our arrival, we were expecting a pet goldfish in our room as well as turndown service at night (we've always had turndown service at other Kimptons). We didn't get either and after re-reviewing the website found out that these items are \"upon request.\" That was a little disappointing, especially since it was a quiet Sunday night and the hotel wasn't full by any stretch of the imagination. Another nit-pick: the hotel's website says their wine reception from 5-6 pm offers \"worldly and wise\" wines. Eh, not so much. They were pouring Columbia Crest Two Vines Cabernet, a bottle of which can be purchased in the grocery store for $6.99. Not so wordly or wise! Oh well. It's free I guess! The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was large with good water pressure in the shower and no shortage of hot water for an older building. We could hear our neighbor early on Monday morning on the phone so it could have been a bit quieter but we understood guests on Monday morning may be conducting early business from their rooms. All in all, no major complaints and for the \"name your own price\" it was a good deal. Be aware, there is only valet parking and it will run you $40+ dollars a night with tax.

We have always thoroughly enjoyed the colorful and eclecticly fun decor, the wine hour, the convenient downtown location, and the sincerely hospitable service. The rooms are quiet - our most recent stay we were located on the 3rd floor facing the street, and our room was next to the elevators. In another hotel I might have asked to be higher to avoid street noise, or further from the elevators, but here there were no concerns about noise and I am sensitive about this. We have never traveled with a pet before so this visit was a bit of a test to see if our 6 month old springer spaniel would be okay on an overnight in a big city. A couple of calls to the hotel prior to our visit allayed most of my concerns - the hotel is truly pet friendly - no added cost for a pet, and they will puppysit for free for the first two hours, if the guest is going out, and $10 per hour after that. (They will keep the pet behind the front reception desk). There is a patch of green across the street in front of the library for the dogs convenience, and this did work for us, but alas, there were no other patches of green in the immediate neighborhood. But, this is a downtown hotel and that is to be expected. Everybody was indeed very accommodating to us and to our puppy, they delivered puppy treats and toy and cleanup bag to the room. Also, we enjoyed a very lovely complimentary wine hour downstairs (main lobby is currently under renovation, looks to be completed soon, can't wait to go back and see how it looks!) and our dog was loving all that socialization. There were some kids at the social hour, and a guy did some magic tricks to entertain them, that was new to us! Also, we got parking at the hotel at half price because we drive a fuel efficient car, nice perk, thank you. We belong to the Kimpton loyalty program which is free and a great idea, we got free internet, and also a $10 coupon to \"raid the mini bar\". We were very very happy with the fresh new look in the rooms and as always we love the staff - we will keep this hotel as our #1 choice in Seattle.

I bought tickets for the Teatro Zinzanni and in doing so browsed their hotel 'sponsor' list. The idea of a jacuzzi tub in our room appealed to me greatly and after looking around the internets I didn't come across another hotel that offered this amenity. I booked the deluxe Mediterranean suite reading over the descriptor four times to be sure I selected the correct room with this awesome tub and then another four times when the confirmation came in my email. I asked for an 'early check in'. I called the day before to confirm everything and told them the time we were planning to get in which was noon. The guy confirmed they shouldn't have an issue with this and if a room wasn't ready they could certainly hold onto our luggage. We finally arrived, although a bit later than planned by an hour. A room was not ready but they held onto our things while we walked around downtown and got lunch. We returned about 3pm and was informed our room was finally ready. (Yay! Jucuzzi tub to rest our achy feet!). The next bit I found a bit odd having traveled around the world and stayed in various hotels of various stars. Instead of the bellhop taking our key, luggage, and us up to our room we were handed our key by guest services and the bellhop attempting to drop our luggage at our feet. We were puzzled and the kid finally gets it and asks if we want it taken up. Well, yes. He takes off with our things and says for us to head on up that he'll be right there. Our room: Major Major Major Horrible Massive Dissapointment. As soon as I walked in I said to my husband 'This is not our room.' Checked through the entire room and it most certainly was not what we paid for. There is NO jacuzzi tub and to add insult to injury our view is of a parking garage. I call the front desk and am informed that there was a burst pipe as of that morning and therefore half the rooms of that kind were flooded. So there WAS 4 rooms but we JUST missed them although we were there earlier as per original request. It was 'Unforseen' so it wasn't something they could work out with us. The guy did tell me that if he had checked us in he would have told us and apologized. Offered us a 'discount' of $50 (so obviously doing us a favor). Being that I was so utterly dissapointed and, well, peeved, I chose to bite my tongue and accepted it graciously. Essentially, my room was handed off to someone in the time we were out for lunch and there was no intention of some form of reimbursement. After finishing up with that large debacle, we noticed that our luggage hadn't arrived. 20 minutes had passed, where was that lazy bellhop? My husband left to find out and caught the kid getting off the elevator with our luggage: 'I'm sorry. We got busy.' and then lingered at our door waiting for a tip. Yeah, not going to happen. So that was a rather small issue but like I said, having traveled a lot my idea of what's supposed to happen at a hotel is obviously very different than this particular locale. On a side note: the food, phenomenal. The restaurant and bar room service: Excellent. The valet service: Excellent. we will not be staying here again. I will not be recommending it. And if I had known we wouldn't be getting a jacuzzi tub I would have booked a room at W Seattle for the same price that actually INCLUDED valet parking in the cost not just as a hospitality as I later learned upon arrival at the Monaco.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakewood, Washington", "Title": "\u201cThis might be our favorite Kimpton\u201d", "Author": "tikiville", "ReviewID": "UR125768347", "Content": "We made last minute reservations (day before) for an overnight in Seattle.

We had a Monaco King room which was pretty spacious, with a desk area, lots of room, and a really comfortable bed.

Perhaps one of their doggie-guests been chewing on the chair. That's another thing. We didn't realize it was a pet-friendly hotel. I don't know if that's a new thing, but my husband never saw any pets there the first time around. Maybe because it was during the week, and this time we were there on a weekend. I'm fond enough of dogs, but I don't really want them staying in the hotel rooms that I stay in. However, it's my fault for not noticing the pet-friendly tags on their website beforehand. The dogs were well-behaved overall. There were several in the lobby off and on, and we heard barking twice from our room. Lastly, the weekend rate in February was a great deal, we thought.

I decide to give up, leave the car out front and let the hotel deal with it whenever someone showed up. On my way back up I realize I can\u2019t just give up, because my KEY DOESN\u2019T WORK! I pass the front desk, no one is there but I think I hear someone in the office. I call out\u2026 a gentleman came out of the back office, it was apparent I had interrupted a meal as he had a mouth full of food. I asked him if he had left the hotel because I have been walking around looking for someone for thirty minutes. He seemed annoyed that I questioned where he had been and told me that he had not be gone \u201cthat long\u201d. I decided then that I wasn\u2019t going to bother arguing with him. I asked him to please take care of the car and replace my room key. I handed him my room key and put my ID on the desk. He took my key asked me what room I was in, hit a couple of keys, replaced my card. However he did NOT, I repeat he did NOT once look at my ID. I just stared at him in amazement. So not only was the hotel door unlocked with no one in the front lobby but apparently if you have an old hotel key and ask for a new key to room 305 at midnight you get one without question. Considering my pregnant wife was sleeping in that room just a few nights prior, I was not happy at the hotels blatant disregard for basic security. I spoke with the manger the next day who I must say was a complete professional. She did her best to assure me that this was not the norm and the situation would be dealt with immediately. I can\u2019t help but think that something like this would not happen at a hotel with more than one person working the night shift. I guess it\u2019s back to the Sheraton for me..

Good to save money when you have an unexpected expense. Not too bad of a price for downtown Seattle at $143 plus taxes. The bellman was also awesome as he was able to find me a town car to go up the hills to my work. Saved me the trouble of having to walk up a couple hills! I also liked how they had a whole bunch of complimentary personal items like a comb, toothbrush, toothpaste, etc. That was really helpful as I had forgot to pack those items. More money saved by the way! The evening shift on 1/18/12 also gave me free tweezers and they normally charge a small fee. That was sweet of them! Room service was excellent! Quick service and yummy food! Not much negatives, some mildew on shower wall, some rust above shower, private bar wasn't fully stocked- they should mark that on the price list. I left a note for front desk about it because I didn't want to be charged for items I didn't take; morning shift 1/19/12 didn't seem as cheery as the evening. Poor thing must've not been awake, she was waiting for the printer to print my receipt and it was right in front of her face; she also couldn't print me an itemized receipt which the room service person told me last night that they could. I was told a receipt would be e-mailed to me and haven't received it yet but it's still early. When I tried to make sure the front desk agent had the right email she kind of snapped at me but quickly caught herself. I just wanted to make sure she had the right email address. I made a quick reminder call to Room Service and the person who picked up (Nick) was very helpful! He actually repeated my email address and took down my number just in case. He said he'd check with the front desk and would call back. He did call back within a few minutes which to me is excellent customer service!

You know the kind--they look you up and down, decide you are not worthy, and act like checking you in is a big favor. Normally, I could care less, but we'd just arrived from a long train journey, it was dark and rainy out, we had our discombobulated 7-year-old in tow, and could have used some 'hail fellow well met' at that moment. Publicity boasts about catering to the young uns, but I had to search the website the next day to see what was available for him, and then ask, which put the morning staff in a flutter, because the person who checked us in--I'm looking at you, chilly night check-in guy--should have taken care of it. A much heralded gold fish was brought to our room, which then died. Okay, it happens, it is a living thing, but when we called to have it removed--more 7-year-old discombobulation--we were cheerfully told to put it outside the door, and chirpily asked if we'd like another. I know it's just a fish, but the attitude seemed rather cavalier, especially with a child involved. Yes, they have coffee and tea, but 2 days in a row I had to tell them they'd run out of hot water, breakfast tea, and milk. Don't count on it if you are off to business meetings in the morning as I was. And then there is the nickle and diming that I just can't stand when I'm paying hundreds of dollars for a hotel room--one-ply toilet tissue, big bottles of shampoo and soap bolted to the wall, slippers with a \"if-you-use-these-we'll-charge-you-$15\" tag attached to them.

(note: If you're planning to take the Link into the city from SEATAC airport be prepared for an extremely long walk with your luggage from the Airport terminals to the train.

The front desk was just checking in to make sure that my room was comfortable and to offer any further assistance personally if I might need something. Perhaps one of the best moments was for nightly turn down service. When I opened the door, I was greeted with the most genuine smile I've seen in any of my travels. She offered me the complimentary chocolates, even some extra ones, and then said, \"Enjoy your evening my sweet sister.\" From the \"Welcome back\" each night from the bell staff, to the kindness of the housekeeping staff, it's the little touches that make the Monaco one of my favorite places in Seattle to stay.

The room was huge and even though the window faced an air shaft- with little sun and great interior decorating, who needed to see outside. Every little touch was perfect. From Bryon at the desk agreeing to let us take a lobby easy chair so we could have two comfy chairs in our room, to the amazing decor of the room we were give. Feather pillows , a great duvet and a throw blanket for getting cozy while you read or watch TV. Plus they have a free program which - if you register for it- gives you permission to raid the mini fridge, use internet for free, get 20% off dinner and $30 off a massage. And who needed a massage when you have a deep Japanese soaking tub to climb into after walking those hills to Pike Place Market? So many touches are to make the experience particular to you. what kind of pillow do you want? which paper? The goodies basket even included condoms and a lubricant if needed. Everu hotel should provide that. Way To Go Kimpton!!! you can even bring your pet and if you don't have one they give you a goldfish in a bowl. The hotel restaurant is far above hotel food. Sazerac had an amazing ricotta gnocchi and beet salad that was to die for and the dessert- pecan maple flan with caramelized bananas was fantastic. Hotel Monaco is located in downtown on a main N-S bus line in the free zone. the central library is across the street- cafes and amazing ethnic food surround you and so you can eat cheap and great within a walk from the hotel. Wine is served everyday at 5 and coffee/tea awaits you in the morning.

Every member of the staff made me feel not only like a valued customer but that they genuinely cared about my comfort.

The only complaint is that it was so well liked, the place was packed by 5:30pm. Breakfast was just as good as dinner and reasonably priced (as far as breakfasts go for four star hotels). And the relationship was tested as well: Upon check out, I had learned that I had been charged for a bottle of wine I had not consumed. I figured that it was due to a bottle I had brought in and left out on the table. Simple mistake and simply explained. But I did wonder how this would be dealt with. No problem. I explained that I did not drink the bottle of wine and that they were welcome to run inventory and if it was missing they could put it on my tab. No need.

We were a bit early for our room so we had a late lunch at Sazerac, the restaurant adjoining the hotel. Went with the staff suggestion of drink and Ahi tuna sandwich and both were excellent. Upon finishing our lunch the desk called us to tell us they were ready and we headed up to our room. Just as we had requested we had a higher floor with a King bed. The suite was two rooms divided by a curtain and looked exactly as their hotel pictures show, including a couch, fridge, 2 tv's, bathroom with tub/shower, desk, two wing back chairs, and all decorated in bright stripes and prints..Just makes you want to smile! Large bathroom and animal print robes to use as well. Both the room and bathroom were clean and well kept. Bed was comfortable. Turn down service was available. Free wine tasting every evening in the lobby. They knew it was my husbands birthday because he was an In-Touch member, and to our surprise they delivered chocolates and wine to our room!

The hotel staff and Restaurant staff were very nice about it. My only real criticism was the small fridge was chock full of mini-bar treats and parking costs forty plus dollars per day.

I booked the rooms for an amazing price ($70/nt) through Priceline. Because of this, I was concerned we may be treated like 2nd class citizens but that was certainly not the case. Prior to arrival, I phoned the front desk and asked about a room upgrade. I expected to be charged for this but to my surprise, the front desk clerk advised me that if I sign up for the hotel's free rewards program, I could get a free room upgrade. So he proceeded to sign me up over the phone and then upgraded our room to a King Suite with jacuzzi tub. It was fabulous! (Thank you Jason!) The room was lovely. The rewards program also included a $10 credit for the \"Raid the Mini Bar\" program and free wireless internet. I had also asked Jason if he could arrange for a birthday note or something to be left in the room for my husband. Well, he did better than that. In our room we found a bottle of sparkling brut wine and a bag of chocolates. Wow! One of my favourite things about the hotel is their HosPETality Program. Amazing! We weren't charged extra to have our dog. She was welcome throughout the hotel except the restaurant so during the free wine hour in the lobby from 5-6pm, I sat sipping my wine with my dog at my side. You are allowed to leave your pet in your room unattended while you shop or dine, providing the pet is well behaved. Just leave a contact number at the front desk in case of problems. You'll be given a little sign to hang on your doorknob alerting staff to the presence of your animal. If you don't feel comfortable with this, the front desk offers pet sitting on a first come-first serve basis. Your pet can be tethered behind the front desk to hang with the staff for up to 5 hours. First hour is free and then only $5/hour. The staff here were wonderful. One day we arrived back at our room to find a dog dish with our dog's name written on it piled high with dog cookies and a stuffed goldfish toy. :o) The goldfish signifies another program of the hotel. If you are lonely during your stay, just ask for a pet goldfish and one will be delivered to your room in a little fish bowl, complete with name tag. The hotel does have an attached restaurant that seems quite funky but we dined there on a Sunday night which had a limited menu so I can't comment on the food. Parking is valet and quite costly at about $38/night. However, I think that's pretty standard for hotels in that area. There is no pool/spa but there is a small, adequate fitness room.

There is a lovely wine and beer reception in the lobby each evening and it was fun to see all the pooches hanging around this dog-friendly establishment.

Which means easy walking distance (or a quick cab ride away, at most) to many fantastic restaurants and city attractions. None of these things are a surprise when staying at a Kimpton hotel, and I've stayed at several. What was beyond the exceptional ordinary was the attention given to a Kimpton InTouch Rewards Program issue (the hotel's guest loyalty program) I had with one of their properties I usually stay at in Portland. I sent an email to the Hotel Monaco's manager prior to our stay regarding the previous oversights of the Portland property, inquiring if they might give some attention to the matter. Within twenty minutes I received a reply. WOW! They assured me the problem was being researched so that it wouldn't happen again. They were prompt, responsive and made a service recovery on behalf of the other property when it wasn't even \"their\" issue. Not only that, my beau had garnered this particular reservation via Priceline, so we were already getting a fabulous rate to begin with. When we arrived, there was a bottle of wine, chocolate and a lovely card waiting for us. The valet attendant made our life easier by offering to keep our car parked curbside since we needed to leave soon after our arrival. Our room was upgraded to a suite and and it was fabulous. I'm a longtime hospitality veteran with years in the hotel industry. True customer service seems to be a dying art, and yet Kimpton manages to hire, train and maintain a staff of people who seem to find joy in elevating the quality of a guest's stay. Bravo to you all!

The bathrooms were small, and very very plain. Nothing close to some of the luxury hotels I've stayed in in the past. But the hotel was very clean, comfortable, and in walking distance of most of the downtown attractions, which was what I was looking for. For the price I got on Hotwire, it was great. For the regular going luxury hotel price, not so much. Now the hospitality. The hotel staff were very nice for the most part, but I had read so many reviews about how they went above and beyond. This was not the case when I visited. I looked like crap when I arrived at the hotel - after delays at the airport, and 2 layovers, I looked about 15 years old, with terrible bed hair. I got to the hotel in the middle of the day, and the two doorman just looked at me. No \"Let me grab the door\" or \"Let me help you with your luggage.\" Just looked at me, grunted a \"hey, good afternoon\" and went back to talking. This ended up being the last time I ever saw a doorman for my entire weekend stay. Got to the front desk, and immediately, the clerk judged either my appearance, or my booking through Hotwire. He mumbled a few things about the hotel, gave me my key, and went back to doing whatever he was doing. A girl at the desk was checking in a different customer, a older, male gentleman, and went through a clear, welcoming explanation of the hotel and amenities, and asked if he was a Klimpton member. He said no, and she explained how he could sign up for free internet. All of which was never even asked, or mentioned to me. I looked back at my clerk and said \"Um, Im a member. how do I access the internet?\" He suddenly became a lot nicer. From then on, I really didn't bother with the hotel staff. The cleaning crew were very nice and helpful however. They helped me out when I couldn't find my toothpaste and the front desk said \"Oh we ran out.\" uh. huh. The last day I needed a taxi, and told the front desk to call one 10mins before I checked out (Seattle is not known for its cab services...so you really have to call in advance). I walked out...no cab. \"Oh we called! He should be here asap\" 10mins later, no cab. I asked the front desk to call again, and they said \"Oh sure, in a bit\" Um. No. I ended up taking a gypsy cab that I hailed myself that cost me 2x as much, but I had a business meeting and I was nearly late.

In-room Coffee Maker can be requested, but the one they delivered to the room was worn down and the coffee mug was filthy. We didn't use it. - Furniture: Upholstered furniture with stains, casegood furniture are poorly assembled and sticky from wear, Furniture in general were tired and worn - Bedding/Sheets: Stained sheets and pillow covers first night, second night was fine.

The front desk staff were efficient and friendly, made a great dinner recommendation for a local brew pub. The room Monaco Suite, had a pull-out with TV in living room and a King bed with additional TV in the bed area (seperated by a curtain) - it would have been great to have a refrigerator, I suppose you could ask to have the mini bar emptied.... With the in-touch I was given a Raid the Mini Bar coupon which was good for $10 during my stay. Also I had opted for breakfast for $1 and used that the second day (it was excellent!). Most impressive was that after I returned and they sent the questionaire about my stay, they got back to me regarding my suggestions (thought they needed more electrical access for plug-ins - they said they ordered power strips) -- It seems like the NW Regional director reads all of the reviews and takes an interest in what you say..........

When I was waiting for the elevator, two housekeeping staff were sitting on the couch next to the elevator and the staff door was open with another person talking to them.

The next odd staff encounter happened when a housekeeper followed me to my room and yelled in bad English asking when I'd be leaving for the day. I told her a time. But then when I went to leave before that time, she chased me to say she didn't realize I was checking out. ok .... Lastly, I checked out and told the front desk that I needed to check bags. I was late to my conference. They called the bell services and then I waited and waited right in front of the front desk at a chair. Finally, I asked for an update and they called again. I was right in front of them waiting impatiently with my bags looking at my watch and they couldn't help! The staff need some help with training. Otherwise, this is a top notch hotel.

We concluded our vacation with 2 nights at the Hotel Monaco, a Kimpton hotel in Seattle, Washington. We had a delightful vacation, with great service and food offerd in our two previous locations. We chose to stay at the Monaco because we have stayed at Kimpton hotels on at least three previous trips, in different cities, and enjoyed the experiences. It was an easy choice for us to stay at the Hotel Monaco. We arrived on time and after a fairly long travel day (6 hours of driving from Whistler with a couple of stops en route) and were greeted warmly by the staff - at the curb at check in and by the counter staff when registering. When we inquired about dining alternatives, it was suggested we consider the on-premises restaurant, Sazerac. We quickly visited the restaurant prior to checking in to our rooms, found the menu to be inviting and the restaurant itself to be warm and comfortable. We enjoyed the wine sampling in the lobby during early evening and dinner at the restaurant was so good we decided to return the next day, after spending the day walking and touring the more popular areas of downtown Seattle on foot. Dinner the second evening was just a good as the first night. Importantly, the concierge of the hotel, the wait staff at the restaurant and all associates with whom we interacted at the hotel were simply superb. I am in the \"customer servce business\" myself so I have more than a passing interest in observing quality service delivered by other businesses. The hotels of Kimptom we have previosly visited are consistent...clean, very neat, more of a \"boutique\" sense, generaly reasonably located and fairly priced.

I've never actively searched out a hotel group, but after this stay, I'll go out of my way to stay at a Kimpton Hotel. (And yes, I'm actually embarrassed to go on like a walking advertisement, but our time there was amazing and I feel it's warranted.) The best thing Hotel Monaco has going for it is its service - from the front desk to the valets to the housekeeping. It's refreshing to come into contact with staff who don't come across as disenchanted with the organization. I sheepishly asked about getting a goldfish for our room and, I swear, they were more excited to arrange for one than I was about getting it (special thanks to Shaynee and Hayden). The doormen/valets were exceptional (special thanks to Nick) and always friendly. Housekeeping gave such special care to our room that I felt guilty using anything in the bathroom. The second best thing, is the location. The Monaco is so centrally located that we questioned whether we truly needed a car during our stay there. It's about a 10-minute (lovely) walk to the Market down streets that are interesting in their own right, and about 3 minutes from amazing shopping. The Sazerac is a happening place - great food (you must try the dates) and atmosphere - and you feel lucky to have it available to you downstairs, as opposed to other hotel restaurants that \"will do\" if you're simply too tired to venture out. The fitness room is more than adequate and, while I didn't use the business center, it looked to have everything you would need. And if you have the option of getting a room with a jacuzzi, DO IT - they're spacious and deep. The Hotel only has valet parking which, I'll admit, can add up quickly. I had read online that the Kimpton group strives to be environmentally responsible and therefore offers a discount for those driving hybrids. This came in handy when we had the choice to rent a Prius. Upon check-out, I was informed by the staff that Monaco had a special promotion during the month of August whereby valet/parking was complimentary for those driving eco-friendly cars! I wasn't sure whether I was more impressed by the creative promotion or pleased that I'd saved a significant amount of money, but I walked away elated. Prior to arriving, we filled out a Kimpton membership (at no cost), which asks for preferences on everything from room placement to pillow firmness to your choice of daily newspaper. I filled it out, doubtful that it would actually be taken into account; yet, upon arrival, I found that we had indeed been reserved a corner room with firm pillows and the daily Seattle Times. In addition, there was a card in our room welcoming us to the Program and entitling us to $10 worth of mini-bar purchases (from which there were many to choose). I realize that I may be gushing here, but our experience was so wonderful that, even though the hotel is not the cheapest in Seattle, we left feeling like we'd gotten a steal. Before our trip we'd been torn between staying at the Westin or taking a chance on this boutique, and I'm so happy we chose the latter.", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cLeopard print bathrobes; enough said.\u201d", "Author": "akubelly", "ReviewID": "UR77018057", "Content": "Stayed here by myself on a business trip and wished I was with someone.

In fact, we were very happy about our choice!! We had requested an early check-in since we disembarked in the morning. The rooms weren't ready yet, but the front desk girls who were very friendly and plesant told us she will call my cell phone when the rooms are ready. They happily stored away our luggages so we could go explore the town. They also showed us on the map how to get to certain places. A friend traveling with us was a librarian and the Seattle Central library was on her list of must-see. Image the plesant surprise when she found out the library was just across the street from the hotel! A couple of hours later, they called us to let us know our rooms were ready. I can't say enough about the front desk girls' plesant and courteous attitude - it just made us feel very welcome. The rooms were beautifully and tastefully decorated. And they were spacious!! This was important as we had tons of luggage from our week-long cruise. The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable. I liked the little gift shop that's at the end of the hotel. The next morning, we were plesantly surprised by the complementary Starbucks coffee, ice coffee, and banana cakes. Those cakes were so good!! They went perfect well with the coffee. Hmm...

I love Kimpton properties. I tried staying at another non-Kimpton property and I regretted it to the point where I canceled my second night and booked at the Hotel Monaco. So, I was coming in to town from out of the country and I arrived late... probably around 10:15 or so. I was tired, frustrated, and just wanted food and a bed. The front desk clerk was so nice and kind to me; it made the difference. I had a room on the 11th floor, which I assume is because I'm a Kimpton In Touch member. I loved it! I love being on high floors. When I got in to the room, it was warm, cozy, and everything that I love. The bed was incredible and the bathroom was large and clean. I have a thing for bathrooms. Instead of dining downstairs, I decided to hop in the shower and order room service. I ordered a turkey bacon pannini at 10:45 and was told it would be about 25 minutes. I waited and waited, and finally I called at 11:45. Apparently my order got missed. They were quick to correct it and I had my sandwich by midnight. They did not charge me and they even gave me an adorable bag of chocolates. I appreciated their apology and effort to rectify the situation; I was more than happy, even if it was delayed. The only thing is, they still didn't get the sandwich correct; there was no bacon on the one that was delivered to me, which is what I was sorta craving. No matter... the sandwich was still delish and really enjoyed it. Just like I have a thing for bathrooms, I also have a thing for robes. The one thing I do not like about Kimpton are the robes. They are a funky animal pattern and the robes always seem kinda worn and faded. I can appreciate Kimpton's effort to be funky, original, and very chic through a simple feature, but there has to be a better option. It's not a big deal, but just sayin'... I love the shampoo, conditioner, and soap at the Hotel Monaco. I don't know who makes it or what the fragrance is, but it smells elegant and earth, organic and exotic, all at the same time. The products were in the shower in a pump, so I couldn't bring any home to research the products. When I like a hotel product, I try to bring the travel size home so I can research where I can get some for myself. Anyone know what products Hotel Monaco uses? Also, as a KIT member, I received a voucher for two free honor bar items. I didn't use the voucher, but it was a nice and appreciated touch. The valets were wonderful when I arrived and when I checked out. And when I got in my car, there was a little package with crackers and juice, tied with a little bow, and a card inside that said, \"We miss you already.\" It made me smile, and I missed them, too! ;-) I cannot wait to stay at my next Kimpton hotel... and I cannot wait to go back to the Hotel Monaco!", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cOne of my favorite hotels.\u201d", "Author": "PattyDMD", "ReviewID": "UR66800358", "Content": "This was my second year staying at The Hotel Monaco Seattle for business.

We decided on Hotel Monaco simply based on location (which is terrific) and pricing. From the moment we walked in, our experience was wonderful. I booked online and received the option of an upgrade which we received at a fantastic price. Let me first state that I am self employed (I own a tattoo studio) and I have found my outward appearance to have a negative impact when I travel, especially in nicer hotels. That was absolutely not our experience with Hotel Monaco... we were treated well and every staff we came across was warm and welcoming. We arrived a few hours prior to check in, our plan was to use the time to grab some lunch. The staff gladly secured our belongings and offered to call us when our room was ready. It was ready much earlier than expected. Both the front staff and porters were wonderful. They were quick to offer a hand and point us in the right direction when asked. The room was fantastic and the housekeeping staff was unusually happy and friendly. On our second night, we ate at the hotel's restaurant. We came in late and it was a busy night. I ordered a vegetarian dish. Soon the restaurant manager politely informed me that they were out of that dish... he had already consulted the chef and had recommendations readily available that met my dietary preferences. It was one of the best meals I'd eaten in a long time. Staff checked in soon after my first bite to make sure I was happy with everything, I couldn't have been happier. Upon checkout, again our train was leaving later than our check out time. Our bags were again securely stored even though we were no longer really staying at the hotel, when we retrieved them, staff offered to call our taxi and assist us until we were on our way back home. Dumb luck brought us to Hotel Monaco, however the next time we are in Seattle, we will be back because our first experience was so good. I would highly recommend them based on location, the accommodations and of course the wonderful people who really cared that we had a great couple of days away. By the way... this is my first review of a hotel like this. Just like most of you, I'm sure.... I am quick to share my negative experiences in hopes of making a small difference for the next patron (after all, this is an opportunity for hotels to learn and improve), however I am happy to be sharing this great experience with you, and I hope you have as wonderful experience as I did!", "Date": "April 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oak Park, IL", "Title": "\u201cWell located hotel was a pleasure\u201d", "Author": "Pentwater--summerjoy", "ReviewID": "UR60283014", "Content": "Hotel is well located a few blocks from waterfront and Pike Street Market.

The Monaco in Seattle is no exception.

When I checked in, I received a very pleasant welcome and was told that I had been upgraded. The room (a Mediterranean Suite) was huge, with an enormous soaking tub and separate shower -- plus there were two goldfish waiting for us. Kimpton also has a new program where 2 things in the mini-bar are free -- it may seem a small thing, but when I was parched at night, it was a blessing! On the Thursday I arrived, there were free chair massages and a wine tasting in the lobby. On Friday, there was Guitar Hero. On Saturday, a tarot card reader. And always free wine tasting from 5pm to 6pm. This was a nice way to relax after a day of sightseeing -- and a pleasant way to mingle with other guests. The location was fantastic: 10 minutes to Pike Place Market -- and one block from the uber-fabulous Rem Koolhaas-designed Public Library. For a delicious lunch (and dinner) try Purple; it's 2 blocks from the Monaco. The only negative thing I can say is that I don't think many (any?) of the rooms have a view. We were on the top floor (11th), and our windows faced another building. This was not a problem for us, as we don't go on vacation to gaze for hours out windows -- but if a view is essential to your hotel experience, you might want to ask about this before reserving a room.

Our regular haunts in Seattle were booked, so on a lark, we tried \"Hotwire\" for the first time. We did not know about Hotel Monaco without the benefit of Hotwire, and per the Hotwire instructions I contacted the hotel about room types. Then I read a Tripadviser response from the hotel dated April 7, 2009 that didn't resonate well with us (basically the message I interpreted is that you are hooped if you book Hotel Monaco through Hotwire). Our flights had us arriving early into Seattle and I advised the hotel about the arrival and my partner's condition (made worse by a foot injury a day before our trip). For us, front desk was an exercise in what could not be done; 1) My partner slept in the lobby from about noon to 1445hrs; regular check-in is at 1500hrs, 2) We did not learn about having to request coffee or tea en suite; I learned about it the next AM when I saw another hotel guest in the lobby with coffee mugs, 3) the quirky goldfish element wasn't mentioned at check-in, so I asked twice about it the next day, 4) I asked the same front desk clerk who checked us in to have the burnt out light addressed by the bed...it wasn't. I asked someone else and it was fixed immediately. Another shift supervisor learned about our poor experience and sent up wine, chocolates and a handwritten note as a gesture of service recovery and for that we are thankful. At check-out I advised the same agent who checked us in nothing I asked of her was done, so she blamed the other areas. From doormen to housekeeping to maintenance, everyone else was great. Only check-in was brutal and front desk service was uneven. The rooms are small per building period, made smaller by the bold striping and the lack of natural light as the room faced another building, but extremely clean and the room in a location quiet. We were OK with Aveda toilettries, though dissappointed it wasn't L'Occitane. I suspect the Hotel Monanco views Hotwire bookings as the no frills/budget bookings and not \"found\" bookings (when in fact we paid more than if we booked directy; we just didn't know about the hotel). We are fond of boutique hotels (our favorite is in Palm Springs), but for us this one was a miss.

Bed was comfortable, everything was very clean and animal print robes were hanging in the closet for guest use. Aveda bath products were great quality. We had a small bite at Sazerac which is the restaurant in the hotel. It was very convenient and had good quality food. Restaurant also provided room service. The wait staff was incredibly friendly and efficient!! Happy Hour had great deals!! I loved the idea of the wine hour in the evenings, we unfortunately didn't take advantage of it, but it was very popular. The complimentary Starbuck coffee and tea in the lobby helped us get a jump on our day! I was nervous about the location as it was my first visit to Seattle, but it seemed like anywhere we wanted to go was within walking distance or a $5 cab ride.

Well to start off I booked a suite and paid extra and then found that their website description is not what you get. A suite has more than a bedroom and a bathroom (standard hotel room). When I took my printed reservation down to the front desk and showed them that it said things like two TV, a couch, ect, the desk clerk told me \"oh, they mixed two suites into the same description on the Kimpton Website - sorry about that how about a free breakfast\". You got to be kidding me! Even Embassy Suits has a sitting room, bathroom and bedroom unlike what Kimpton calls \"a suite\". I was here for a 5 day stay and this was how they offer to correct false advertising? I send the Kimpton preferred guest website an email asking about the failure to provide a suite as advertised on their website (my reservation description) (also furnished a hard copy of the reservation printout (from their website) to the front desk manager on duty) and did not get any reply or solution. I also send an email after the trip (guest survey) and once again did not get any follow up via email or mail. So I guess that tell you how concerned they are about guest. The staff ranged from indifferent to not helpful. I asked the front desk if their was any good breakfast spots in the neighborhood hood and was told, no only the hotels. Gee I found one of the best breakfast spots in Seattle 1/2 a block away, how convenient that the hotel does not know they exist. We arrived late the first night (11 pm) and had to go inside and run down the bellman who busy chating on his cell phone to get any help with our bags. Prior to my arrival I had emailed the hotel to inform them that it was my 20th Anniversary as my other half is really picky so I wanted to make sure everything was good to go. I got a nice email back saying they would like to deliver a bottle of champagne and some chocolate covered strawberries to our room upon arrival to celebrate. I also told them we needed foam pillows. So upon arrival no champagne or strawberries, no foam pillows and we had a great room with a view of an alley and high rise building -nice! Now the good - you will not find a better housekeeping staff or a cleaner room than this property. We were very impressed that when we left each morning to go out shopping that they made up the room before we got back (even short trips of 2 hours or less). The beds were comfortable. Not so good - the AC-Heat control has a 4 x 4 inch screen that is bring green and will shine directly in your eyes all night. If you are light sensitive, you will have to tape something over the controls. This is not a 4 start hotel, it a very clean business hotel with super high rates.

Missed 3 separate wakeup calls. Concierge was always busy and hard to get in touch with. Didn't provide much guidance on special requests. TV hard to use and iPod sound dock in suite non functioning. ---- I decided to book a Mediterranean Suite for my 3 night weekend stay after my 1st choice (where the rest of my party was) filled up. In comparison to the W, I spent about $45 more per night but had a larger (square footage) room with a great soaking tub (with whirlpool jets) and a nice shower. Before my stay, I had the hotel arrange a car service, the price $53 with tip was reasonable and the driver was waiting for me on arrival. Checkin was easy but the downside was that with a room that was picked for its 2 person jacuzi tub, I found no bath accessories (salts, bubble bath etc...) and didn't get any during the stay. The first night (got in around 12/1a) I checked in and had a voucher for a bottle of champagne (nice gesture) and the fish waiting in my room. First impression is that the room was huge but there was so much open space I felt that the room was almost too big. The TV was far away from the bed so it was a chore to change the channel. The iPod dock was also broken which was disappointing. In the morning on my way out I asked for someone at the desk to check the thermostat out (it said 65F but was around 74, which was about 2 degrees too warm) and try to cover its face for me at night (bright blue light kept me up). When I got back to the room that night, no one had done either. That was the 1st drop by the front desk. I called maintainence and someone came to look at the thermostat but he told me to play around with the settings until I was happy (why have a digital box if it won't work!?!??!?!) I asked for a wakeup call at 10am the next morning, that didn't happen. I called later for a 6pm nap wakeup call.... they forgot that. The 10am wakeup call the next morning, yep, it was forgotten.

Our daughter's 9th birthday was 09.13.08 and we promised to take her and two girlfriends to see \"Shrek the Musical\" at the 5th Avenue Theater, and decided we'd make a fun night out of it by booking a nearby hotel as well. We settled on the Monaco based on its proximity to the theater, price, and Trip Adviser reviews, and couldn't have had a more rewarding experience. The play started at 2:00 PM, so the day before, I called and requested an early check-in of 1:00. I was told there was no guarantee, which is industry standard, so we left our house headed for the Monaco with no real expectation of being able to check in to the room early. To my utter amazement, we arrived and were checked in and on our way up to the room in about 90 seconds. Big points there. While checking in, I asked the front desk staff to send three of the child-sized animal print robes and a few goldfish up to the room while we were at the play as a fun surprise for the girls. When we arrived at the room, it was clean, spacious, and very nicely furnished and decorated. I almost always take pictures for TA reviews, but we had so much on our plates that day, it just didn't happen. After the play, we returned to the robes and goldfish as promised, and the girls were ecstatic. The little touches that the hotel provides really personalize the hotel experience and make it feel so much more homey, as opposed to many of the sterile hotel experiences I've had in the past. We didn't spend long in the room before heading down to Sazerac (the hotel's restaurant) for dinner. In the mean time, my husband sneaked my daughter's birthday cake out of our car and left it with the front desk staff with instructions that we would like to order it from room service so that we could keep it a surprise from our daughter. No problem. Dinner was wonderful, and our wonderful (and patient!) waiter overheard it was a birthday, and surprised the girls with a chocolate lava cake for dessert. They were thrilled. When we finally headed to the room for any length of time that day, we were surprised to find three gift-packs for the girls, courtesy of the hotel, along with a nice card for the birthday girl letting her know that whenever she was ready, they had some cookies and milk for her - she simply needed to call room service. Another wonderful touch. Eventually we ordered our cake from room service and it was delivered along with candles provided by the hotel. The girls loved that. :) I can honestly say that the hotel was dead quiet that night - I actually wondered if our floor was empty. The beds were quite comfortable (although my husband took some issue with the pillows. All things considered, I think we'll give it a pass!) and we slept well. The next morning we headed back downstairs for breakfast and it was quite good. I have a few suggestions for the restaurants Bloody Mary bar - Sazerac, call me! :) Checkout was smooth, and when we left, everyone was incredibly happy with our experience. As a humorous side-note, my daughter and her friends stayed up so late the night of her birthday, that she was exhausted when we got back to our house. At bedtime that night, she burst into tears, lamenting that the \"best day of her life was over\". She also asked if we could go back to the Monaco next year.

We had a Monaco King Room, and they have a program where you can adopt a goldfish for your stay. Our adoptive goldfish was named Belle. Belle was a charmer, very interactive for a fish, and we really missed her upon leaving. Check-In was fast and friendly, and after we had dropped off our bags we went back down and asked some directions from the front desk staff. They were very kind and gave us maps, suggestions, and directions to our specific query. The one little blip in our arrival was that we are Kimpton members and the specific little preferences that were supposed to be on tap for our room, were not in place. However, they later made up for it with a nice little fruit basket and mineral water. It is a beautifully done, elegant, smaller hotel, and I loved the reproduction Minoan frescoes, a la Knossos, in the reception area. There is definitely a \u2018personal touch\u2019 to the Hotel Monaco Seattle. The hotel is placed well, and we were able to walk to some nice downtown shopping areas and to the Pike Place Market, albeit nearly everything was closed by the time we made it down there. One negative, and it had nothing to do with the Hotel, were the swarms of homeless that approached one asking you to buy a 'paper'. Apparently Seattle deals with its homeless in a very humane manner and gives them identity badges and allows them to sell these newspapers. A unique approach to the problem, but it does get bothersome the fortieth time one is asked to 'buy a paper'. That and the rather seedy looking fellows lounging in a doorway, as we were getting near Pike Market, who were coveting my hub's camera - Seattle is beautiful architecturally so he was taking snaps like mad. However, I gave them my meanest - i.e. if looks could maim, ex-NYCer, ex-Chi-towner, ex-Miami, current LA Hollywood denizen glare and they backed off right quick. So, try not to look like a tourist in downtown Seattle, unless you are ready to thrash someone to a pulp if they try to jump you. Frankly, from my point of view, try not to look like a tourist anywhere! So, other than those two little blips, Seattle was fab, and the Hotel Monaco was AbFab! We had a nice large room, it was oddly shaped, but I do like things like that, and a huge window with a view up toward what I suppose are the hills. If one were of a voyeuristic bent, you could watch the life going on around one down on the street, and across the way in the residential buildings. The bathroom was large and spotless, with nice soft towels and L'Occitane products. There were some free sundries, and also a list of other sundries available for nominal prices. In the mini-bar were lots of choices, and these cute little stuffed goldfish that one can purchase. Yes, I got one and named her Belle, Too. In the closet were robes, camies and boxers in assorted sizes, and an umbrella that one could purchase, on the honour system. All in all, the items in the closet were a little on the pricey side - so I did not partake of any, but we got a good price on our room from my hubs corporate travel agency, so we ended up paying less by almost a c-note that we would have paid if we booked the room ourselves. The normal price of the room was comparable for others of the same class in the same area, but I liked the Monaco better because of the ambiance, the 'Green' feel, and of course, BELLE! Oh, and the bed, and pillows, were EVER so comfortable. I might even consider buying one from the Kimpton website sometime in the future. I had a wonderful sleep. The decor was nice and bright, but it had a modern classical empire sort of vibe, as well. There was free wifi, a definite plus, and I got to see other guests walking their pets, which always makes me happy. Although, it did make me miss my kitties. Also, there is a little shop on the main floor for sodas, emergency things if you need them, and they have souvenirs, too. There is an exercise room downstairs, but I didn\u2019t have time to use it. Although, it did look nice and clean. The next morning my hub's niece, who lives in Seattle, met us for breakfast at the hotel restaurant, Sazerac. The food was very tasty, mid-priced, and the staff very attentive. When I asked if the breakfast potatoes had onions in them - I am allergic to onions - they went to check, and then later when I didn't get the turkey sausage I ordered and I enquired about it, they said they had substituted it with ham because the turkey sausage had onion in it - ham had been my second choice. The waitress had remembered, and YES, she got quite a good tip for her attention to detail. Our niece, who had never been to the hotel before, told us that she would be coming back to Sazerac with her friends. The decor of Sazerac was lovely with all these wonderful free form glass fixtures, for which Seattle is famous, on the ceiling. The only possible cons about our hotel experience would be that the three elevators could be a little slow, and that there are only ice machines on a few floors, and of those two were broken. None of these problems were deal-breakers. When we visit Seattle again, and we will be going back, we will be staying at the Monaco again if they are available. It will be our first choice.

The hotel is located in the center of a big busy vibrant city, and I expect to hear a little normal street life noise, but thankfully there was not a noise problem. Besides the very cool gym, I also enjoyed the complimentary yoga equipment in my room with the video fitness workouts on TV. Loved the fun animal print bathrobes and cool toiletries and the offer of their trademark pet goldfish during my stay.

The doormen/valets always with a warm welcome as they opened the doors as guests enter the lobby. Evening complimentary wine and beer hour from 5-6pm nightly, and morning coffee in the lobby was a treat. Complimentary Wi-FI in rooms and lobby was another added touch of value.

We booked under the hotels website for the Seahawk package. No charge for parking and got a voucher for a taxi. Only problem was that the taxi driver didn't want to accept the voucher and barely spoke English. Funny thing was is that I speak Arabic and called him on it he started making comments about my girlfriend on his cell phone to his buddy. It took him a second to realize what I just said to him and the fact that I could speak his language, His face was priceless. He still was an ass and I told him off. That is to be said about anywhere in a large city. I told the head Doorman of the issue and he called the cab company promply for me to get an answer why they didn't take it. He apologized and offered to pay for the taxi. It was only a few bucks as you are 2 miles from the stadium. If you go for any game, plan on a taxi to get there...but the return you are going to be humpin it back. It was great walk though and we didn't mind. It was right before Christmas was wonderful to see all the lights. You will see the homeless stowed away in some of the building entrances, but they leave you alone for the most part. Police presence is not the greatest in that area as they are down at the stadium. Most activities was within 7 blocks (Pike Street, waterfront, etc) and great coffee shops along the way. The hotel is well mantained and the foyer is awesome. The wine tasting was available in the evening. I will be back and the best part is...you can take your dog. I will be taking my St. Bernard with me next time as he is part of the family. There are two safes in the hotel which one is located at the service desk and the either is in the room.

There is a coffee maker but the one in our room had a defect. It said \"pause & pour\" but when I lifted the coffee pot it leaked all over which means the filter basket was missing the mechanism.

There is an Hour of Indulgence in the lobby from 5 to 6 p.m. but I really feel the word \"indulgence\" should be removed and they should just call it Happy Hour. They had one red wine, one white wine, one type of soda and absolutely nothing to eat. No snack to go with the drinks. I asked a woman who was pouring drinks if there was anything like peanuts -- anything at all and she said \"no, but that sounds like a good idea\". I'm sure they have people ask all the time even though she acted like I was the first person who ever inquired.

I have stayed at Inn Suites hotels where they have a happy hour with drinks and popcorn so you would think a Kimpton hotel would have some kind of snack.

Apparently there was no manager or any kind of supervisor over the weekend and we had to wait until Monday morning. The young man we spoke to said that they would cover the food, adding that the person that changed the sheets said that it was fresh blood, in a very rude tone. Our checkout was at 3pm because of the package that we booked. From 12 to 1:30, three staff (maids) tried to walk into the room, and after opening the door apologizing and closing it. Two people called up saying that \"check out was at 12\" and I had to remind them of the package. I finally packed all my things up and went downstairs to check out. Quickly signed the paper and took off. When on the way, I took a closer look at the room bill. Unfortunately they never covered the food, which they had offered and we were charged for the valet.

However, it was definitely a disppointment. The decor of the room and the hotel was as I had envisioned...very nice indeed! The housekeeping staff was very impressive, all were extremely polite, cheery and helpful. However, the front desk & bellmen were below standard in customer service. There were lots of \"little things\" that on their own could easily be overlooked, such as the broken make up mirror sagging from it's post in the bathroom, or the jiggly entrance handle to the room (didn't feel too secure when the handle is nearly falling off the door!). My husband had an early morning flight mid-week and we asked for a cab to be called. It was suggested to us that the cab ride would cost double what a private car flat-rate would be, but that wasn't the case at all. I knew the cost of the cab (about $30), and the car would have been $38, but the bell staff insisted that it would be more like $65 for the taxi ride. The cab driver later explained that the bell staff get a kick back for their referrals. I would have preferred as guests in a city and/or hotel, that the hotel staff be looking out for our best interests rather than their own. We were there for New Years, and had planned on dining at the restaurant in the hotel on New Year's Day. We came down dressed for dinner only to be told by the front desk that it was closed due to the holiday. We asked where else we could go nearby, and the response was \"good luck finding anywhere today.\" Good luck? Thanks for the help! Another feature I needed for the hotel was to have a business centre that I could work from. They do have one downstairs, but one computer was out of service completely, and the other one was only semi-funcitional. As their internet service is out-sourced, I ended up spending almost $50 of my own money on a system that wouldn't work (no refund), and 2.5 hours of my vacation time trouble-shooting their computer with the internet company's toll free service line! I had asked the front desk several times for assistance but they told me to do it myself! The worst part of the whole experience was that every time I asked the front desk for any assistance, I got a response that included a shrug, as if to say \"oh well, too bad for you.\" I found the majority of the staff had an attitude that they just simply did not care if you needed help, and if you dared to intrude on their time, then I got a snotty response. On two occasions, I even caught the front desk girls smirking at each other when they thought I had my back turned and couldn't see them. Talk about frustrating! In all honesty, I couldn't wait to check out. Nice decor, liked my goldfish, the housekeeping staff were great, but the front end of the hotel made me want to dash in and out of the door so I wouldn't have to get in their way, not that I had to be too concerned about anyone taking it upon themselves to greet me anyway, I was pretty much ignored by anyone in the front desk area unless I approached them. Next time, I'll go across the street to the Westin.

Overally, I've been very pleased. Checkin and checkout are easy and I've never had to wait in line. I've stayed in both a suite and the basic king room. The suite is essentially a very large room separated by a curtain. The sitting room has a couch and additional flat screen TV. Unless you're traveling with more than 2 people or want to spend a lot of time in your room, the standard room is more than adequate. Suite bath is pretty much the same as a regular room (they do have suites with jacuzzis that might be more elaborate). Hotel is only 11 floors so don't expect panoramic views. Furnishings are \"funky\" but tasteful. Rooms appear to be in good repair. Robes (with animal print) are standard. Large flat screen TVs with many, many channels are standard. Bathroom amenities (Aveda) are replenished daily. Bathrooms are modern with tile floors and granite counters. I've had mixed room service experiences. Twice, it was fast and food (pizza) was excellent. One morning breakfast was late and cold. The soft-boiled eggs were hard, which is good because they didn't provide a spoon. The attached restaurant is okay, but the one time we tried it service was very slow. Have heard that it's good for lunch/dinner but the menu wasn't that appealing to me so didn't try it. The concierge was helpful but was rarely seen before 9 or after 5. However, the front desk personnel were great. Wake up calls came promptly. There is free wireless and wired interet access as well as a computer in the lobby for those who didn't bring their own. There are some additional nice touches. First, they host a \"wine hour\" from 5-6 each evening. Wine is decent (and free) and they do refill your glass. It's a nice way to unwind and mingle with colleagues or even strangers. They are also very pet friendly -- actually seem to enjoy pets rather than merely \"accepting\" them. For example, this huge dog joined the wine hour and started to wander off into the restaurant. The staff didn't panic -- merely quietly alerted the owner who rectified the situation. The location is good -- walking distance to a lot of things. However, the hotel is on a San-Francisco type hill, so if you walk down to Pike Market, it's a VERY steep walk back up. The one nice thing about this hotel is that it caters to a variety of traveler types. We saw Packers' fans (in town for the NFL game), business people, tourists, etc. A nice mix with nice staff.

The exercise room is pretty standard Kimpton size, which means adequate but not outstanding: four eliptical cardio machines and two stationary bikes, each with personal viewing screens. The cardio machine screens accept DVD's, which I have not seen elsewhere. As with all Kimpton hotels, and the Hotel Monaco line in particular, the hotel's lobby is stylish, quirky, and inviting. It's easy to imagine spending time relaxing in the comfortable, over-stuffed chairs. The restaurant attached to the hotel, Sazerac, is very good. So far, I have eaten lunch there and look forward to breakfast tomorrow.

At many hotels, he would have been penalized for arriving a day late, but when he pointed out the mistake and change of rate to the front desk staff, she immediately changed the rate back without hesitation. The concierge was very helpful in recommending some great restaurants and an affordable spa. One thing to remember though is that he leaves at 6 every night. My room didn't have much of a view. My view was of the street in front of the hotel. The hotel is in a building shorter than the surrounding buildings. My colleague had a better view down a street. The room was not huge, but it was spacious. The bathroom was very spacious. Everything was extremely clean. The free high speed internet was reliable. The bed was comfortable, but I do not like feather pillows, and that was all they offered. The climate control worked very well. The hotel is decorated brightly. The large (32\"?) flat screen TV with many channels is a nice bonus. The room and hallway had a musty smell, but I got over that quickly. Aveda bath products are a nice touch.

It's difficult to get there (only one elevator goes to the lower level and that isn't noted so I had to call for instructions as to how to get to the lower level). Once you find the fitness center, its odd arrangement has to be noted. Cardio equipment faces a mirror wall while the communal television is behind you. If you want to use the small televisions attached to the cardio equipment, you'll have to go back upstairs to the front desk to get headphones. The equipment isn't very impressive and the lone treadmill is \"out of order\". You can find better facilities at a Holiday Inn Express. The in-room spa treatments presented a lot of confusion. Several phone calls were required to confirm treatments and even then, one treatment was cancelled just minutes before its scheduled time. This is a nice service and one of the big benefits Kimpton offers, but the Monaco Seattle isn't handling this service well. Room service staff was great, but food was only so-so. Doesn't compare to other great Kimpton restaurants (the Cypress in Cupertino and the Palomar in San Francisco have excellent restaurants). In-room jacuzzi would have been great, but a ring of grime circled the tub. And once filled with water, a multitude of dirty \"floaters\" were in evidence. This was an OK stay.

The lobby was beautiful and the staff allowed us a generous 3pm checkout so we could relax before our overseas flight. The room was quiet and clean and everything worked. But we were surprised to see that the room was decorated hideously. The room we got did not, in any way shape or form resemble the beautifully designed rooms advertised on the hotels Web site. The pillows for the beds were left in the chairs and there was no bedspread. The wall paper was grey and white and very depressing. In SF, I loved the Monaco's whimsical colorful style but there was no color or design in this room. Here, I felt they had really misrepresented their rooms which were dull and boring. For me a nice decor helps make me feel at home and cheers me up and this room didnt do the trick.

At the San Francisco Monaco, there was a lovely spa with a sauna and big hot tub. Here in Seattle, we paid 100 dollars more than SF and there was no spa at all. Why was it so much more? Finally, the room service menu did not include any vegetarian dishes except pizza. It seems like a no brainer to consider vegetarians when you make a room service menu. If you can include dogs, why not cover about the 10 percent of the population that doesnt eat meat. We were very disappointed with the Monaco Seattle. But if you are a carnivore who doesn't care for spas or decor, you might just love the place. The service can't be faulted.", "Date": "July 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cLess Than Gracious Service\u201d", "Author": "LPF", "ReviewID": "UR5439174", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Monaco at the suggestion of a friend who usually stays at their sister hotel, Hotel Vintage Park, just around the corner.

Every person we encountered, from the very busy front desk and valet personnel to the chamber maids doing turn down service greeted us and our dog warmly on every occasion. Our dog was treated like a queen instead of being shooed away and given the evil eye like what happens at most pet \"friendly\" hotels. The front desk and bell/valet staff dog sat for us on several occasions and our dog had her very own leopard print chaise lounge to rest on behind the front desk. She was walked and played with and felt so at home she was distressed when we packed up the car to go to our next destination. The room was very comfortable and though it was close to the elevator, we heard no noise from it or from people walking by. The bed was dreamy, the linens divine and the water pressure in the shower was more than adequate. Room service breakfast was on time every morning, very tasty, and the tray was always removed no more than ten minutes after we put it in the hall. We had dinner at the restaurant one evening and were disappointed in the food, but the service was perfect. The Monaco is on Spring and 4th, across from the fabulous modern Library, and there are loads of restaurants within walking distance or a short free bus ride. We were able to take the dog for walks to the federal courthouse two blocks away which has a huge grassy hill and another great view of the library. Overall, this was the best hotel stay I have had in a major city.

We had the misfortune of having a room full of kids next door, but the front desk responded very well by moving the kids to a different part of the hotel, rather than moving us.

It was truly outstanding in all areas from decor, cleanliness, and especially the service. The reservations and check-in process was flawless. I made a couple specific requests by email prior to our stay, and the staff always returned my emails promptly, ready to assist. We splurged and stayed in the Mediterrean Suite, which was wonderful. There was an emormous jet tub, and the room was spacious, very comfortable, and clean. The free internet access was also a plus. All other Seattle hotels I've been to have a fee. I was blown away by the friendly and competent staff at Hotel Monaco. Everyone from the front desk staff to the concierge to the housekeeping staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The only downside of our stay was that our hotel room smelled a bit of ciagrette smoke. I had specifically requested a nonsmoking room. When I called the front desk, they assured us that we were on a nonsmoking floor, but that they'd be happy to move us to another room immedietly if we were not happy. Because we so enjoyed our unique suite, we decided to stay rather than move to a smaller room. We were more irritated by the guests who'd stayed before us and smoked in a nonsmoking room than we were with the hotel, which made efforts to remedy the situation. Following our stay, I received a thoughtful and personal email from one of their staff members apologizing for the occurence and guaranteeing that the problem would be discussed with housekeeping in an effort to more thoroughly clean rooms of smoke in the future. I was extremely impressed with this timely response, especially because I'd never made a formal complaint about the room, I had just mentioned it briefly.

But the mattress is a rock hard standard hotel bed that kept me awake both nights. The furnishings are nice and the colors and patterns fun but the chair had a rip in it and the wall paper was peeling.
