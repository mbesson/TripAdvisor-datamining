However, we were not prepared at all for the very steep staircase which seemed to go on and on. Luckily we were only there for a few nights so we only had little cases to drag up the stairs! The room I stayed in had a small window which I kept permanently open due to the room STINKING of cigarettes! I sprayed alot of my perfume to mask the odour. There was a communal shower which wasn't too clean. The positive side was the staff were friendly and 'laid-back' (well this is Amsterdam if you know what I mean). The breakfast was very good, we helped ourselves to a mighty amount it too! My recommendation is that this is a very niche Hotel, in other words if you a) have Back Problems/Disabilities b) are put off by smoke smells c) are older than 30 then this hotel IS NOT FOR YOU!", "Date": "February 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mingbob", "Title": "\u201cDo.

We arrived and were shown to a basement room (after being told there were \"no other rooms available at all\" by the less than understanding receptionist) with no window, with maintenance work being loudly carried out in the hallway outside. After complaning, we were miraculoulsy given a top floor room. Had this suddenly become available within the last, literally, 180 seconds? The television was in an awful condition, no ironing board was supplied as we had been told and the room had no air-con. We were next to 2 very inconsiderate travellers, who, due to the thin and ultra NON soundproof walls, kept us awake till at least 4am each and every night. Breakfast was OK, but very basic and in a horrible surrounding. The Vondelpark entrance at the end of the street was fenced off and all in all, my opinion of Amsterdam has been soured by this truly horrific hotel.", "Date": "July 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cVery Basic\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5143681", "Content": "We were first shown to a room with no window, so luckily we got changed to a room with a window.

While it was very nice to have our own bathroom, it was absolutely not worth the money. The bed was pretty uncomfortable, the TV was black & white and the elevator smelled terrible. Considering I was able to priceline a 4 star hotel room for substiantally less in another major european city, I really feel that the Hotel Pc was kind of a rip off. Amsterdam is an expensive city to stay in, but with a little work, you could defenitely do better. I should also note that this hotel has a different name on the front, it is called the Hotel City Gardens, not Hotel PC.

The location of this hotel is in fact, quite close to the museums and to the more chic shopping area. However, this hotel, or motel rather, needs a major renovation. The lift was in bad repair, and the carpeting worn through, even at the lobby. The rooms were, to be kind, fairly rundown as well. The beds and sheets looked clean, though. The receptionist was polite, and professional. If you are looking for a purely budget hotel, this could be the place for you. But between this and Ibis-chain of hotels is a whole world of difference (huge tip towards Ibis). I finally ended up paying just 20 Euros more for a room at Novotel Amsterdam.

It's situated in the street of the same name, PC Hooft, which is the most exclusive shoping place in Amsterdam. The guy who works there gave us a triple bed room for the two of us, so it was a nice start. for the price of 26 Euros per person, we got bed&breakfast-not much of it, but for a shorter stay, it will get you through the morning. Well, the worst thing is THEY HAVE MICE!!! So just don't keep your food in your room, and it will be OK. All the best!

Its a one star hotel and there is not elevator and most of the rooms share a bathroom. This might seem like a problem for many Americans who are used to Ramada style accomodations but it is not bad at all. There were separate toilets for men and women and two shower rooms shared between 8 or so rooms on our floor. The bathrooms were clean and I never had to wait for the other guests during my five night stay. Each room had its own sink. The rooms were small but comfortable enough. I don't think the rooms were air conditioned but I am not sure as we were there in April it wasn't necessary. Breakfast is included - it is served until 11 am and included hard boiled eggs, ham & cheese, coffee, tea juice and rolls with jam.

I have stayed at this hotel three times on my numeorus visits to Amsterdam and have always left wanting to come back. In a superb location just outside the city by the Vondelpark and Rijksmuseum but with excellent walking access to all of the city centre attractions this is far and away one of the better budget options. Ok, the rooms are not luxury and sharing a shower and toilet is a drag but here it is a lot better than many other options. It is also a lovely traditional Dutch building on the most swanky street in Holland! And if your going to complain about climbing stairs while in Amsterdam your obviously a really fun person who knows how to have a good time! Its all part of the experience and if you do get a room on the top floor you should consider yourselves lucky for the free yet breathtaking views of the city.
