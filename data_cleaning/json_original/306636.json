The facilities at the hotel are excellent for kids with 3 pools including a toddler pool and a small play center for kids aged 2-5. The food was good with a wide range of restaurants and the room service food was very good. The staff, those from india and philippines, were really friendly, the other staff were not so friendly or responsive. The hotel offered a free exntension for check out to 2.00pm which was good. The rooms, at least the standard rooms, are not so great. Dated and not good lighting as not much of a window and what there is faces into a wall. Prison cell like feeling. We changed rooms to another standard room that had a basement feeling but was better than the one on the 2nd floor. The grounds of the hotel are really pretty and spread out. There were a lot of unfriendly russian tourists staying there. The breakfast was over priced (90 dir) and so we ate over the rd at the lime tree and at a local cafe while we there.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia", "Title": "\u201cLocation is good\u201d", "Author": "sheikinallover", "ReviewID": "UR126032741", "Content": "Good location for exploring Dubai but also for relaxing.

After a hectic working week, we (3 seasoned business travellers )checked into this hotel looking forward to have a few days rest before heading back to our respective countries of residence. Well, one day and one night at the Dubai Marine Beach Resort place was enough for us. Its not that we are demanding customers or that we expect too much. All we needed was a well managed hotel with a decent beach and the luxury of being able to have a good night's sleep, or even an afternoon nap. Well here is summary of our experiences: The front desk staff was at all times just doing its job - reluctantly, unfriendly, nonchalant, with an attitude as if they were doing us a favour; seems to me that either they lack managerial support/expertise ..or they just don't give a hoot. Our rather dark rooms were actually almost like a Japanese hotel ..a bed with walls around. Our windows faced a wall - thus the darkness, and behind this wall there was a mosque ..with 5 daily very loud prayer sessions ..which meant you got woken up at pre-dawn, you couldn't have a peaceful afternoon nap, and you had it blaring at your room during the night... Well, it is is a beach hotel ..so we tried the already rather limited hotel beach front - what a sight: you have a industrial-type concrete retaining wall on one side and on the other side there is the port. If felt like you were actually on some sort of industrial beach front and they allowed you access to a small slice of their yard to use for leisure. Now - remember .you are staying at a beach hotel ! So you think you could chill out, forget about work and just enjoy the little strip of beach and the beach front. Not so. We were now about to discover 4 amazing things that you CANNOT do at the hotel beach front: ACHTUNG 1: All guests have to clear the beach by 6pm..you can't even sit on the beach with a glass of something and enjoy the later afternoon breeze & sun. ACHTUNG 2: All guests have to vacate the beach front deck chairs . ACHTUNG 3: Given the fact that there wasn't much of a beach to use anyway, we decided to use the shaded beach bar to stay out of the sun for a while. But, here comes the next stupid rule : The would not allow you to eat at the beach bar ..not even a sandwich ..they actually want you to eat at their tables in the hot blazing sun. Well , we ordered our meals at the table and then carried our food to the beach bar. ACHTUNG 4: The beach bar has this beautiful Italian coffee machine. BUT the rule is that they will not serve coffee / espresso / cappuccino after 5pm. No reason given. This was the last straw. So now ..there you have it ..a beach hotel with amazing rules - lousy rooms, poor overall maintenance, front desk staff with an attitude ..it felt like we were somewhere in Russia. This hotel is said to be the oldest beach hotel in Dubai ...and it really shows. By the way, the hotel is very popular with over-sized middle-aged Russians as well with Middle Eastern customers. We checked out, and went further up to the other side of the Jumeirah beach front ..found ourselves a nice hotel, - same price, better service, a nice beach front, and no stupid rules.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "istanbul", "Title": "\u201cGood spot to be on the beach and 5 min.close to the shopping\u201d", "Author": "leylek", "ReviewID": "UR120198969", "Content": "This hotel is located at the beginning of the Jumeriah beach very close to the old town, dubai mall and convention centre.

I am so much of a water person. I find it relaxing whenever I see water features around me. I simply love this hotel because it has everything I needed in a hotel. A hotel doesn't need to be fancy to be called 5-star. Because the 5-star rating has to cover every aspect of the hotel. The service, the ambiance, the look, comfort, accessibility and basically everything that would make any traveller feel like home away from home with luxury and style. This hotel has it all for me. The people are very warm especially from the housekeeping they made sure that I and my partner have everything that we needed as we are on a business trip. Imagine how hectic our life can be? But these people made our stay worthwhile and hassle-free. Definitely kudos to the Management!!! A few more improvements on the sound-proofing will do this hotel better to cater to the needs of those staying in the villas near the high-way. This is mostly where the problem comes in as you see on the reviews. For me I had a really good location so I wasn't really bothered by such noise. As of the rooms being small, I also woudn't bother...admit it you do not stay in the room the whole day!!! so why do you need a spacious room? I see nothing wrong with it. I would rather have an over-sized bed in a small room rather than a small bed in an over-sized room. So please don't be mean people we just want comfort so I guess it would be fair enough to not exagerate. The beach is fantastic, the pool is very well maintained and the bar and restaurants is just inside the facility which makes you not ever needing to go out to find a decent meal or hang-out.

I would certainly agree with the other reviewers who say that this place is definitely not 5-star standard. Many of the rooms are small and dark - you will need the lights on even during the bright Dubai daytime and noise from inconsiderate people banging their doors may be a problem due to the echoey nature of the hallways. You may also suffer noise from what I assume is air-conditioning plant at the back of some of the villas. Check-in and check-out are often very slow. The breakfast buffet is very good, but the food and drink prices are outrageous and the quality of the evening food is not always good. As a Brit, complaining to the management doesn't come easily, but this is one of the few places anywhere in the world that I have sent a meal back and refused to pay. Most of the service staff seem to be Indian, which is usual for this part of the world, and their attitude and politeness is generally very good. Unfortunately, the same can not be said of some of the Eastern European staff on the front desk, whose surly, dismissive demeanor borders on rudeness. On the subject of Eastern Europeans, out of curiosity I once enquired at the front desk whether the hotel is Russian owned, because several staff, including management, are Russian, and this hotel attracts MANY Russian guests. I was told that it is not Russian owned, but if you've ever had experience of Russia (many times for me) or Russian people you will understand the significance of this paragraph. Having stayed at the Dubai Marine several times I feel I know the place quite well, which makes me feel a little suspicious when I read the recent rave reviews (July & August 2011) below this one. Notably, the reviewers have only reviewed this one hotel. Hmmm...

I am in the \"Family suite\" this constitutes a very small bedroom with a king size bed, basically this is the bedroom, a lounge area, a small walk in closet and a large bathroom. The pillows on the bed are in dire need of replacement, I didn't even want to use them, as I made the mistake of taking them out of their casing, b/c they were so lumpy and uncomfortable I wanted to reshape them, they were really just disgusting. Other issues are the furnishings; the sofa has many stains on it that have been repeatedly cleaned, or attempted to be cleaned off. The furnishings are sparse and give the impression that they've seen better days, not to mention their lack of comfort. Housekeeping is not the greatest, when asking for extra towels I was told yes and then never received them, repeatedly. I forgot to pack my bath toiletries, and used the hotel's complimentary items, thinking they'd be replaced the next day...they were topped up with water, I've never encountered this before in any hotel. Wait staff at the pool bar are basically a bunch of 20 something boys who hang around checking out the women at the beach, even so far as the Lifeguard blowing his whistle 3 times when a women worthy of approval walks by. It's rather barbaric, he attempted to chat me up, and kept giving me huge cheesy grins and winking at me until I asked the waiters to tell him to stop, they pretended they didn't understand my English, and I told them if he didn't I'd go to the supervisor, he understood me very quickly after this. It was not at all what I expected from a \"5 star hotel\" I found it to be insulting and inappropriate. It is rather costly at \u00a3170/night or $225 US with no extras,(this was a special discount internet rate my Assistant found) breakfast was not included, this was an additional \u00a318 per person, or $25 US, this wasn't anything spectacular either, your basic breakfast buffet for double the cost. The beach cushions were dirty and old looking, and the side tables were filthy and worn, replacing these would cost minimal, and make the beach look substantially better. There is NO cold water in the room, the best you can expect is warm water, due to the fact that they don't cool the water, as it's \"too costly\" Overall, I'd say this is no where near a 5 Star hotel, charging higher rates does not make it a higher class hotel it just makes it an expensive mid range hotel. Stay somewhere else for less money, and better rooms/service. I'm off to try the spa tomorrow after my day of meetings, for \u00a352 or $70 US for 1 hour, I must say it's a decent price, fingers crossed. The Mexican Restaurant next door is very good, however also very pricey, the Lebanese restaurant is fantastic, and offers belly dancers and an Arabic Singer, who is pretty amazing.

We arrived on the Virgin flight at around 8am and therefore got to the hotel at 9.30ish. We walked up to the reception desk and were completely ignored by the attendant for a good 2mins. When he finally looked up and brusquely asked for our names and passport, he told us that our room wouldn't be ready until 3pm as check out isn't til 12pm! We said that we were not told about this and his general attitude was pretty much \"tough luck\". It was then the kindly Phillipino porter who took us downstairs and allowed us to change and leave our bags, who advised us to go and relax by the pool and he would come find us when the rooms were ready. Every contact we had with the reception staff from then on, I have to say I found them to be disinterested, unprofessional, unfriendly and generally unhelpful. Our first impression of the Hotel was great disappointment and unfortunately for this reason I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. The rooms are clean and well ordered, the bed was extremely comfortable and although there is no view, we liked spending time in the room. The small private beach is beautiful and the pools are very nice. There is a large mosque directly opposite the hotel so you can clearly hear the call to prayer several times a day (Inc 5am!) but I found this quite beautiful and haunting and I wouldn't say it was a nuisance at all. There are several restaurants in the complex which are good value for money and the food is delicious. We liked the Thai and Flooka fish restaurats the best. Overall this Hotel has great potential, the basics are great and the facilities really make this a fine resort but the staff really let it down at times. In a hotel of this calibre you really expect a friendly smile and a can do attitude from the staff, unfortunately we found neither were apparent here.", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Austria", "Title": "\u201cnice beach hotel\u201d", "Author": "martin4711", "ReviewID": "UR94928556", "Content": "spent three days at this beach hotel: nice poold; great foot, a bit overpriced.

Having arrived very early on Saturday morning, (3.00am local time), the receptionist's attempts to upgrade us to a suite for an additional \u00a3170 were not welcome and, in hindsight, gave a good indication of the hotel's attitude to its guests. First impressions of the room were generally positive - a fair size, free safe, well stocked mini-bar, wall-mounted flat screen TV, serviceable bathroom and balcony. At 4.45am were awoken by the first call to prayer of the day. Whilst this is to be expected, the Jumierah Mosque, (just over the road from the hotel), is one of the largest in Dubai and possesses an incredibly powerful loud speaker system. No mention of this in the literature interestingly enough. We were awoken at the same time each day. Breakfast gave us the first opportunity to see the hotel in daylight. The grounds are fantastic, incorporating a wide array of water features and greenery. Each and every member of staff said hello as we passed; the general ambiance was exactly what we were looking for. This spell was broken as soon as we entered the breakfast area in the so-called Taverna. Whilst the food is good the service is surprisingly poor, not because the staff are incompetent, but because there are simply not enough of them. One of the main reasons which set five star establishments apart from the rest is the attentiveness of the staff, who generally go out of their way to make the say as memorable as possible. Not at this hotel! A further distasteful factor was the way in which the manger of the restaurant spoke to his staff in front of guests. Quite inappropriate and rude; little wonder they didn't appear motivated. The pool areas are good but guess what? That's right; the attendants will happily stand and watch guests wrestle with umbrellas and sun loungers until they do themselves an injury. Order a cup of tea from the pool bar and, if you're lucky, it might arrive 15minutes later, usually without a pot of milk. Then you'll get the bill - 18 Dirhams, (about \u00a33.20), so no doubt that the prices are five star! The beach rescued the whole place in my opinion and single-handedly justified the price of the holiday. The sea is pleasant and clean and the beach is soft and sandy! Many happy hours were spent down there. The gym is well equipped and staff were welcoming and helpful. After speaking to other people it is clear that compared to other five start hotels in the area this one is much cheaper, and so with that in mind I would recommend it. - just don't expect genuine five star luxury.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Everett, WA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, I'd give it an A-\u201d", "Author": "BlueNinja", "ReviewID": "UR90757729", "Content": "I stayed here for one night with a pair of friends.

It did not have a kettle but when asked it was provided. The staff were all polite and extremely helpful, doors opened, towels put on your sun bed, if you need information they were always help. getting you a taxi etc they could not do enough for you. Hotel is very clean from the rooms to the pool area. 3 pool areas which were always pretty emty, never had a problem getting beds there was plently. The beach area is lovely too - no complaints. The hotel is in a better located then the atlantis. everything is close by. Nothing is in walking distance but the taxi are very cheap (ie \u00a33 to the Dubai mall, \u00a312 to Atlantis which is a 40 min drive) never tried the buses as the taxis were so cheap. There is a rep in the hotel to book excursion which we used and they were all brill and the highlight was the dessert safari. The open beach is right next to the hotel if you want to excape the hotel but we never felt the need. The drinks at the hotel were expensive, never used any of the resaurants to pass comment and there is also a night club with in the hotel but never used that either. There is a supermarked across the road and TGI Fridays and a few other shops including boots the chemist. The only down side really which no body else seems to have commented on is over the road from the hotel is the biggest mosque within dubai. It is lovely to look at but remember muslins pray 5 times a day which starts every morning at 5am and you can hear the chanting/prays at that time it used to wake us up but we also got back to sleep as it only lasts a couple of mins and by the end of the week we used to laugh about it. Also Friday is realious day and not much is open during the day but does reopen around 8pm. If on your first day you do the big bus tour it will help find your feet to where everthing is to go and visit, and it will show you a lot of sights.

They told us it was full and when I asked if it was likely we would be able to go in if we waited until other people left, I was ignored and snubbed for another group who walked right past. It did not say on Time Out that you needed 'reservations'. Two guys also attempted to get in but were told they had to be in a 'couple'. There is absolutely no need for rudeness and snobbery. If it is reservation only then they should advertise it as this but the door staff seemed to be quite contradictory so I am not entirely sure what the 'terms of entry' were for Boudoir that evening. I would not recommend the nightclub to anyone visiting Dubai and would suggest the management either train their staff to be more polite and understand their own terms of entry, or acquire new staff.

I asked the bell boys at the entrance, I asked at reception, who then sent us to the concierge who then sent me back to the reception - I asked all these areas if they were expecting us & if I could please check in to then be asked what my room number is??? - it took four trips to to different areas from entering - all the while my hungry & thirsty children had nowhere in reception to sit & keep themselves busy & the Taxi driver was left in the lurch outside with all my luggage & duty free shopping while I tried to either get booked in or get moving on... The concierge kept insisting on taking my hand luggage which I never allow anyone to take. It was as if they went all out to create maximum confusion & chaos so that I was distracted continually. While I chased after my children they scanned in copies of each one of our (my children & I) passports & took their time printing the documentation while my hand luggage then disappeared to supposedly be found outside with the rest of my luggage & the taxi driver still waiting to be paid & for me to appear. The executive suite was one of the closest to the rest of the amenities according to the resort map & the main room was a nice size & the linen clean, however pull-out sleeper couch was WELL past it's life span & neither it nor the bed had mattress protectors for cleanliness. The sleeper pull-out couch was that bad that my two children could not sleep in it together it sagged that badly. Room service was poor, the food came in carried on a man's shoulder on a tray & was cold in about 3minutes flat. The fish & chips were soggy & oily. The salad insipid, pale & I'm sorry I didn't take a photo for this review. Generally the staff attitude was lethargic & disinterested. The tiles around the pool are terribly slippery & dangerous for lively youngster & though the \"private beach\" was just that, it was very steep & small. Added to that the lifesavers were hidden around a corner chatting at the back of the nightclub, on a wooden deck. A substantial distance from the ppols or beach & sea in the event you actually needd to \"Life save\" a person or heaven forbid, a child. We stumbled on them while running to catch up with our youngest heading into the sea. The internet was not easily accessible. While we checked out we asked them to order us a large taxi to take us the airport. Reputable taxi's are easily accessible in Dubai yet it took us reminding them three times & basically panicking about missing our flights & headed into us insisting that they transport us to the airport before a taxi eventually arrived. While this took place, the hotel's mini bus stood empty outside & not once did they offer it. When we insisted they transport us, they told us they would charge us Dhs120. Talk about not receiving service. The Taxi to the airport only cost us Dhs25 including a good tip. I'd like to add that in six years of extensively traveling & hiring accommodation as a family, that we've never had keys \"disappear\". Between unpacking the first evening & until just after breakfast tour first day including time for a bit of outside play for our children, when we returned to the room to lock up for the day, one of our sets of traveling padlock keys did \"disappear\". We spent three hours unpacking every single item & every single little bag (some for electronic devices, some medical aids, others toiletries, etc, etc). They were nowhere to be found. This entire experience was most unfortunately one of those \"twilight\" experiences, hopefully not to be repeated soon. We will be sticking to the bigger branded resorts in Dubai.

He told me to move. I said no. He proceded to order some drinks for him and his friends. All alcoholic I might add! We were then, quite promptly, escorted out. Now, why would a club like that serve alcohol to a UAE national? Why were we asked to leave? Another issue, which disturbs me more, was the fact that my wifes drink was tampered with. This isn't the first time this has happened to someone we know. Many of our friends have had similar experiences, ie not remembering anything from the night, if even after only one drink. Chronic illness throughout the night, black outs, etc. This is not simply after having alcohol, as we have never experienced this in other bars or clubs. Only here. Yes, of course there may be other explanations for this. I understand this story may be heard the world over ffrom other bars and clubs. However, I feel that this has gone on in this club for long enough. I, or my friends, will not be going to that club again. We will recommend to our friends not to go there either. It simply not good enough to deny that drinks are being spiked. Patrons are entitled to enjoy themselves without the worry of something happening their drink and spoiling their night. This club, for the reasons above should be avoided. I do intend taking this up with hotel management. I will post their response, if any.", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "middle east", "Title": "\u201clocation location location\u201d", "Author": "JOERQ", "ReviewID": "UR27720751", "Content": "great location-great facilities-private beach and grass areas...highly recommend executive suite booked direct with hotel 1600 AED inc breakfast...costly internet service", "Date": "April 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bristol", "Title": "\u201cDont Believe ALL you read !!\u201d", "Author": "mgw100", "ReviewID": "UR26394186", "Content": "After reading reviews I wanted to cancel this holiday,but after spending the 4days there, I can say that some people most just like to complain.The room was a good size and spotless (but make sure you insist on a balcony room and dont accept a lower ground one !) .The food was excellent especially the Tai restaurant, even the half board menu was superb.

The room was immaculate, cleaned everyday, fresh towels, toiletries, newspaper, fruit bowls and fresh flowers, fresh bottled water, all complementary, every day. The pools are temperature controlled and there are three: one is deep and very warm, one is large - excellent for older kids and adults alike and there is a kids pool, also excellent. All are immaculate. Free loungers and beach towels, poolside or beach, are placed for you, even down to the towels being laid out. The beach is well kept with boogie boards etc. There are several full-time lifeguards who are especially vigilant with children. If you want watersports go out from the hotel, turn right onto the public part of Jumeirah beach and you'll find them there - that beach is massive, stretching for miles. The restaurants at this hotel are not child friendly, indeed several do not permit children at all, except for at breakfast time. There is nowhere ideal to take the children in the evening on the complex either. For example, one of the bars that is next to a kid's mini playground is closed (in February anyway!). The food is expensive generally, alcohol expensive too, and not good if you have a budget! You will find many people access the hotel, especially at weekends to use the facilities and the restaurants that are not residents so it can feel that you have no exclusivity. However, whilst people can come in to the restaurants (very late as well) it should be noted that their bags are searched on entry and they have no access to the hotel rooms so you are safe. Note that parts of the complex are noisy till late. Watch out for shifty billing from the beach bar. The menu may say something is 18 dhms but you will probably get charged 38 dirhams, because you were looking at the wrong menu, even when they gave it to you! A beer was 27 dhms on the menu but billed at 35 dhms. We were charged \u00a324 for 3 juices on our first day! The staff at the beach bar were quite ignorant about this when we complained but a quick word with the hotel manager corrected this. There are no children's menus anywhere and no children sized portions of food or drink available at all. If money is an issue for you, or if you like good value for the money you spend, go out of the hotel, turn left and eat at Japengo's. You'll get Japanese noodles, Iranian and Lebanese food - platters are awesome, pizza or pasta there so it suits everyone (despite the lack of alcohol). TAXIS: The cream coloured cabs are half the price of the white cabs. SOUKS: Take a taxi to the Gold and Spice Souks in the Bur Dubai area - if your driver looks baffled about where you want to go, ask for the Bur Dubai bus station and then ask a local where to get the Abra boats from - it's near HSBC bank if you need a landmark. You can take a boat across the manmade canal/river to the Souk - this will cost you maybe 1-2 dirhams (20-40p) and adds to the fun. When you get there, ask another local where the Gold Souk is, you probably won't ever find it otherwise....the Spice Souk is near - ask in the shops, people are almost always happy to help you. Leave enough time to take an Abra boat back over then as you disembark walk over to your left - there is an Iranian Souk there too. Don't expect to find any restaurants in these areas, although drinks are readily and very cheaply available either from drinks machines or local people with trays! Expect to pay 2 dhms (40p) for a canned juice. Go to Madinat Jumeirah (near the palm).....it's a new Arabian Souk, pricey but nice to wander. Suggest you go to Japengo's there as well as it's halve the price of the other eateries. You can take a short Abra boat tour of the \"new Venice\" which is quite pleasant. You're near the Jumeirah Palm in this area, short taxi ride, I would say. DESERT SAFARI. If you don't do this with Alpha Tours then when other people tell you how great it is you'll be gutted. Dune Bashing - even for young kids - is fantastic, you eat Arabic food, try traditional costume, have henna, sheesh, belly-dancing, camel riding and more. It's very good value and will suit anyone. Alcohol is available and is reasonably priced. I must say, I was surprised to see people query the rating of this 5* hotel. This is a fair rating. Can't see why anyone would say otherwise. It has all the facilities and service you would expect of a 5* hotel.

My wife and 11 year old daughter and our friends with their 2 children aged 5 and 4 were left with little choice when booking late for a Winter break but took some comfort in the fact that this hotel was rated 5* and was in Dubai, where we have previously stayed in various hotels. The Restaurants and Resort area appear to be a totally seperate enterty to the hotel and are mainly used by locals. There are numerous late night bars that don't close until 3am making certain rooms within the hotel susceptable to noise from late night music and homegoing revellers. The local Mosque is also extrememly close and would wake all but the very heaviect of sleepers at 5.30am every morning with the call for prayer. The rooms although clean, were very average despite being called \"Suites\" and came with none of the little extras you would expect. We were offered an upgrade to an Executive suite which we were told were slightly bigger then the Junior suites and had Balconies and Jacuzzi baths. Well, the Balconies had no view to speak of and didn't have any furniture on them, rendering them completely useless. The seperate Lounge area was used as a 2nd bedroom for the kids by means of a sofa bed which was left as a bed all week. There were no other chairs provided therefore nowhere to sit whilst getting ready to go out. The TV channels were restricted and picture quality poor. The choice and quality of food offered in the various restaurants was acceptable however, we were obliged to stay on a Half Board basis and were not advised of the arrangements on arrival. Basically you are given vouchers which can be used in 6 of the 8 restuarants (the remaining 2 are owned not owned by the Hotel). These vouchers entitled us to a choice from a set menu. However, we were made to feel like second class citizens when presenting the vouchersand were told that the children had to leave the restaurants by 9.30pm which is disgraceful for a hotel purporting to be family friendly. The pools and grounds generally are in urgent need of refurbishment and the waiter service virtualy non existent. The Tropical pool made my daughters hair and various swimming costumes turn green, which although totally unacceptable and never really explained, was compensated by the refund of our room upgrade. On checking out, our bills contained numerous spurious beverage charges which could not be accounted for and although deducted, we were not given satisfactory explanation.

While I have to agree that the rooms are a bit basic, and the d\u00e9cor is a bit dull and not as stylish as one might find in other 5 star hotels, they were very comfortable and clean \u2013 our balcony room (one step up from a standard room) was a good size, with all the facilities you would expect, and a lovely big comfy bed! The on-site facilities are excellent, and the food in all the restaurants we tried for evening meals was very good, although there were a couple of negative aspects regarding breakfast and lunch. 1. We stayed on a room only basis and paid for a buffet breakfast in the Taverna restaurant on our first morning, but although there was a good range of food we felt a bit aggrieved at being charged around \u00a320 for 2 breakfasts although my husband only had 2 very disappointing cups of instant coffee. For the rest of the week I ordered room service while my husband went to Starbucks round the corner so we were happy! 2. On days when we stayed at the beach we ate at the beach bar, and while the food itself was excellent and plentiful, there were only around 6 tables, which sometimes meant quite a wait to get seated, and despite the small number of tables, the food service was very slow. Those points aside, the resort itself has a lovely relaxed, informal feel, and contrary to what other reviewers have said, the staff are very friendly and helpful, and we had a thoroughly enjoyable stay here. The low rise villa accommodation set among beautiful gardens provided a lovely environment, which was very peaceful and tranquil (occasionally punctuated by the calls to prayer from the Mosque nearby, but that is part of the culture of the place).

We only went out for 5 days. Due to this we didn't have much choice in hotels to stay at. My sister had been to Dubai in May this year and twice last year, she actually recommened the Habtoor Grand and the Oasis (very good by the way). These were fully booked and we were only left with Dubai Marine Resort and Spa. My husband and I thought we'd risk it for a biscuit even though the last few reviews of the hotel had been quite bad (too be honest I don't know what planet these people lived on but their reviews of this hotel were unjust!!!!) Ok from the start of the holiday we flew with Emirates (economy class). Compared to British Airways they were fantastic. We had great seats and food was fine. You have your own TV screen and hundreds of films to choose from. One more tip join Emirates Skywards loyalty scheme and make sure you opt for meet and greet service as you get through passport control with a click of a finger. We wished we had done this as we waited ages to get through, almost an hour (not something you want to do after travelling for 7hours). We arrived in Dubai in the early hours of (15th August) Wednesday morning. (The Dubai airport duty free is great). A good tip buy some alcohol at the airport as Dubai is an alcohol free country, therefore it is very expensive to buy in any hotel or bar. The heat in August is unbelieveable (44oc upwards in the day and 35oc at night), it hit us like a slap in the face as soon as we stepped off the plane. We had no problems getting to hotel as we had arranged transfers, very advisable if you don't want to go looking for a taxi in the middle of the night. The hotel is on Jumeriah road and on the city end of Jumeriah beach about 20mins taxi ride from the main hotels on Jumeriah beach. Don't let that put you off as it a goods place to be for the shopping and sand safari. On arrival at hotel, we checked in and the receptionist offered to upgrade us to one of their junior suites for about \u00a328 extra per night. We actually said yes!! (Yes I know, we shouldn't have agreed without looking at the new room). Anyway we booked in without any problems and were driven to our room in a golf buggy. Good idea as we were shattered by then. Yes there is building works going on but only in the day when most guests are away from their rooms. In all honesty it is the same anywhere you stay in Dubai as we had made a few friends in differents hotels from the trips we had done and they thought the same. The junior suite was big, new and very clean. The free toilettries were all Molton Brown (great for me as that's what I use). We were also left with 2 bottles of mineral water a basket of fruit and some other things. The bed in the suite was queen size. The bathroom had a jacuzzi and very powerful shower. The next day we felt a bit silly upgrading as we didn't feel the suite was worth the extra money. We down graded back to a standard room (no problems with the hotel for the change) , which to be honest was just fine as we hardly spent anytime in it. The differences between the rooms are no jacuzzi in the standard bathroom but same shower, just normal toilettries, king size bed instead of queen, no dining table and chairs in standard room, no free fruit or water (but that's for the first night only), both rooms have an electronic safe. Otherwise everything else is the same including fridge and mini bar but cheaper with the standard room. You don't need to take your own beach towels as you're given a towel card each and are allowed to take upto 2 towels each at any given time. We had a good first nights rest, even though the hotel is near a mosque (which is pretty common where ever you stay in Dubai, bear in mind that you are visiting a muslim country). We missed the buffet breakfast on the first day, so had lunch instead (The breakfasts and lunches are served in the Taverna). I wasn't sure at first about the food as it look a bit yuckky, (I'm indian by the way and am very used to eating curries and odd foods.) My reservations about the food and restaurant was all wrong because of the previous bad reviews. The food was fine and caters for all. Lots of fruits and salad available as it's too hot to eat heavy meals in the day (however big meals are there if you want). Some foods are carried over to the next meal but to be honest that's expected in any hotel you stay in Dubai even the really expensive ones. Do not attempt to take any fruit or food outside the restaurant as you are not allowed. We saw some Russian bloke feel very stupid when the restaurant manager confiscated his full carrier bag, that he had been slyly filling throughout breakfast so unless you want to look an idiot in front of everyone don't do it as they class it as stealing!!!!! The beach has nearly white sand and very clear warm water, it is small, pretty and private from locals and other hotels. I thought the beach was very clean and there are more than enough beds & umbrellas to go round. There is none of this business of germans and towels at dawn, whatever time of day we went onto the beach we found a good spot. There is a guy who will come round and put up an umbrella and bed where ever you want to park your butt. A bit of warning the sand gets very hot and you will need fip flops that won't melt in the sun to get from the beach to the sea (only a few steps but enough to burn your feet). There are also a couple of security guards patroling the beach, so you don't really need to worry about your valuables whilst you're in the water or away from your bed. There are 3 swimming pools and the sea, which all have fully qualified lifeguards at all times. At lunch times we either ate at the beach bar or at our sun beds. The food is fresh and plentiful. The mocktails (cocktails without alcohol are fab). We ate out in Meena Bazaar most nights as it's cheap and lots to choose from (about 20mins taxi ride). Try everything, you only live once!!! We loved the Lebanise food. Wherever you go in Dubai it's too hot to walk and you will need a car or taxi which are very cheap. For the women take a thin shawl or a cardigan as the temperature from the outside to the inside of any shop can vary up to 20oc, (it's like have hot & cold flushes). There is virtually no crime in Dubai because if anyone commits a crime they are kicked out of the country instantly and will never be allowed back in. Good idea I think!!! We only had one evening meal in the hotel and that was at the Italian on our last night. To be honest we thought it was over priced, especially the wine but we didn't mind as we had saved so much money the other nights eating at local places. The food was ok considering we weren't in Italy. (For all the men make sure you take some closed toe shoes for the evenings as all hotels, clubs and restaurants will refuse entry to open toed shoes. Smart trainers are acceptable). My only gripe with the hotel was that they lost my favourite dress which I had sent to be pressed on for our last evening. I actually lost the plot with the house keeping manager as this was unacceptable to me. My husband sorted it out for me and I did get my dress back, although I found out that the same thing had happened to another guest on the same day. I know it wasn't the hotel's fault as the dry cleaning was contracted out to a local firm and it was out of their hands. The hotel couldn't apologise enough and as compensation they didn't charge us for any of the other stuff we had cleaned as well, which I though was fair enough. In whole we thought Dubai Marine Resort and Spa is a nice simple hotel and ideal for couples, friends and families to stay at. It shouldn't be classed a 5 star, more a high 3 or a low 4. The staff are very friendly and always keen to help. I have already recommened it to some friends who are going there in a couple of weeks. In your room you will find a Timeout magazine for Dubai, make sure you read it as it has good tips and recommendations on where to go for food, music and shopping and it always upto date. Make sure you put aside a day for the Wild Wadi water park as it is just amazing. We have never had so much fun, we went in at 11:30am and didn't leave until 6pm. People were still coming in as we were leaving. Do try and do the Sand Safari as it's a once in a lifetime experience. It's definately not for the faint hearted. I get car sick quite quickly and was ill right on que through the trip but it was well worth it. I would do it again in a heart beat. We booked both of these trips with a company called Amazon Travel in Meena Bazaar (speak to a guy called Kishan Pattani). They are a honest company and cheaper than most. You will be able to que jump at Wild Wadi with tickets bought from them. I hope that all that I have written will help you enjoy your trip to Dubai, whether you're just going for sun, sea and sand, shopping or adventure.

There is no way this hotel deserves the five star rating. For the price of a room here, you can stay in other hotels on Jumeirah beach that are much better quality. I reserved a standard room for my girlfriend and I and when I got there I was shocked to see how small the room was. It was more like a motel room. I booked a King-size bed but the bed was smaller than a queen. It would have been so uncomfortable fitting two people on that bed. I complained to the front desk and they told me that standard rooms either had a queen bed (theres no way that bed was even queen-size) or two joinable beds (?) but the suites had a King-bed. I decided to upgrade to a Junior suite which was better but still not five-star quality that one would expect for the price. The carpet in the living room was dirty and full of cigarette burns. The couches looked old and even the towels in the bathroom didnt smell fresh. Even worse, when I got into bed I felt itchy all over. I thought I was being paranoid but my girlfriend felt the same thing. I dont even wanna think about what it was. I booked for 9 nights at this hotel but after two hours, I decided I had to check out as soon as possible. Unfortunately, the front desk wouldnt let me check out without paying a penalty and they told me to contact the travel agent I booked through (even though the travel agent had informed me beforehand that all cancellations were to be made with the hotel directly). Anyway, the travel agent contacted the hotel and they finally allowed me to check-out without a penalty, but unfortunately I had to waste two nights there. The only thing good I can say about this hotel is that they have pretty good restaurants and nightclubs which are very popular. El Paso has got good food and Sho Cho and Boudoir are very happening. But you dont need to stay in the hotel to visit these establishments. To sum it up: dont stay here if you want a five-star experience. Check out Grosvenor House, Royal Meridien, Hilton Jumeirah.

Partner had made several phone calls and emails prior to our arrival to ensure that room was as requested so we were very angry that they still managed to get it wrong. Rooms etc are dated but spacious and comfortable with good Molton Brown toiletries. We had a suite with a bedroom, lounge area and huge bathroom. No key given for the mini bar so had to request one! TV in bedroom and lounge. All rooms/suites are set in blocks between meandering paths and lush planting. I am a very light sleeper but didn't hear the call to prayer once so must depend on where you are situated. There is a very small private beach but had huge jellyfish in sea so we didn't use it. Pools are lovely, one seemed to be shallower and perfect for kids with a shaded play area with play equipment for them. One was as warm as a bath and another with a waterfall was more shaded so good to cool down in. Life guards are on duty at all pools. There were plenty of sunbeds and parasols which, once you had found / got the attention of one of the staff, were moved and set up for your convenience. The food at the beach bar was very hit or miss and it took forever to get any of the staff to understand you, not many had a good grasp of English. Also they were very slow at everything but I guess that was because of the heat! Ate at two of the restaurants on site which were good and frequented by non residents mainly, in fact whole hotel becomes a hot spot for non residents at night. We passed Chris Eubank just entering 'Restaurant Boudoir' as we left! On the whole we found the staff to be difficult to communicate with and not very forthcoming. Hotel is quite a drive from the main 'Jumeirah strip' hotels and attractions, with the usual crazy traffic. Hotel wanted a whole nights rate to keep the room until our late departure which seemed very unreasonable especially with the cock-up they made on our arrival.

Similar to a previous reviewer, the staff at reception let the hotel down badly! We arrived very early about 7am after a 9 hour trip from Mauritius. We expected an early check as we were told this was the norm in Dubai. However, the girl at reception, Alex, was incredibly unfriendly and unhelpful.

Also, the restaurant for breakfast was effectively empty as we spent an hour in there. Her attitude and demenour really let the hotel down.

We had problems the moment we arrived. Since our flight landed at 7am we arrived at the hotel by 8am. This being our 5th visit to Dubai never had any problems with early checkins at any other hotel. However, upon trying to checkin we were told we would have to wait until around 2pm-3pm before a room was available. Reason being was that the hotel was full. When I offered to pay \"half day rate\" the lady at the counter (who was very rude) told me she would have a room available with in 1 hour. So obviously they did have rooms available but were not prepared to let us checkin early for free. By time they had a room ready it was 11am, and i was not prepared to pay \u00a370 for a 3 hour early checkin! At this point i spoke to a manager (who only became available at 11am) who apologised and let my wife and I check in.

At this point we headed to the pool area, the pool itself and the area around it was nice, but again the service let the hotel down. It took 35mins for me to get a coke that I ordered, not dubai standards. I could go on and let you know about further lack of service at this hotel but it would take me too long to write it down.

However, the hotel staff in the evening is completely the opposite. It's like a curse comes on this hotel at the evening time. It's actually a nightmare to try getting into the hotel every night. Reason being is that there is only one access to the hotel without an exit. You might be surprised but YES this is the fact. The only exit out of this *what they call 5 stars* hotel is only through Jumaira beach stree. There are 6 restaurants and 2 different clubs on the hotel premises which makes accessibility to the hotel everynight like hell. If you go to the hotel to visit any of the restaurants or clubs you might enjoy it, but if you choose to live there, I believe it might be a big mistake. The second evening of my arrival, I went out and then got back to pick up something from the hotel and then come back to catch a movie. Guess what, it took us more than an hour to drive in and out of the hotel that night (which was a regular week-night!!!!). Two movies have passed by the time I got out of the beach strip (which was the only way out). One other major problem in this hotel is if you would want to use the internet, they charge 1 derham per minute for the DSL connection which is really crazy compared to other 5 stars hotels in Dubai that offer it sometimes for free! The other major problem about the hotel is its rooms which they call villas. They are actually very small in size compared to other suites in other 5 stars hotels. The main room in each villa is relatively small compared to other 5 stars hotels that we stayed in previously. In addition, the rooms seem to be a little old and humid inside, TV remote didn't work! One good thing about the bathrooms that there is a built-in engine for making bubbles in the bath but who needs that when there are many other problems the hotel is facing. I met two managers at the hotel and provided some feedback, both seemed to be very calm and negative at the same time. All management staff in this hotel seem to be clearly a cheap labor and not a 5-stars professional management staff. To sum up, this hotel is not worth the money.

This hotel is situated at the very end of the Jumeriah Beach, sandwiched between the Dry Docks with its towering cranes and building works on the beach. The entire length of the Jumeriah Road has been taken up and is being relaid, widened I guess, although its hard to tell with all the jumble of things happening there. The consequence is that you do have noise on a 24/7 basis, although you cannot hear it in the grounds of the hotel, mainly because of its own construction noises either side. The Dubai Marine Resort and Beach is a little dated in the outer buildings, but nicely laid out grounds surrounding the apartments, which they refer to as villas. The Jumeriah Beach Hotel, some 6 miles along the beach is the ultimate in modern hotels, and worth a visit to the outside lift there as you get wonderful views for miles and miles. Dubai is a nightmare for traffic and jams, forget anything you get into back home, its 24/7 hell on earth if you hire a car. Avoid Avis in the hotel, seek out a much cheaper one in the yellow pages, or so we were told by the Avis rep, too honest for his own good. The shopping is not as good as we are led to believe. The shops around the hotel are some of the best quality, with the rest of the clothes not being to the taste of the english. Restaurants in Dubai offer excellent value food, often bringing two and three extra courses at no cost.
