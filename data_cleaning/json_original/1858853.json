When we arrived, the hotel couldn't find any record of our reservation. Easytobook.com had taken the order but not passed it onto the hotel. Immediately, the lady on the desk told me what had happened, said that they would try to get to the bottom of it, and assured me that there would be somewhere to stay for us. A few minutes later she had sorted it out (by ringing head office and logging into easytobook's computers to find our records) and she upgraded us to a king size room, and even threw in a balloon for our toddler. Overall, the staff here were the friendliest and most helpful we have come across in any hotel. The outside of the hotel looks a bit drab, but the inside is lovely. The king size room was very large with a massive bathroom, all stylishly decorated in contemporary decor. There was a TV with some english channels in the room. The bed was super comfortable. Shower good. They provided a cot for our toddler too. There is a restaurant and bar but we didn't use them. The hotel is slightly out of the centre but there are two ways to get there. 1. Take the free shuttle bus which goes from the hotel entrance to the NH Brabizon hotel opposite the railway station downtown. It is 10 minutes ride and the bus goes from 10am to 11.45pm (i think). 2. Walk 15-20 minutes to the river and pick up the free water taxi that takes you across to the centre. We opted for the bus. There is a market just across the road from the hotel on Wednesday mornings. Features that we found great: Free parking for guests Free shuttle bus every 15 mins (10 mins ride) to Town Centre. Breakfast is available if required: 19 euros pp. We didn't have it Free Wifi in lobby Beautiful modern interior design.

The hotel was described as being 2km north of the city centre with a free bus shuttle service to the centre and it was described as a 4 star hotel. Since it was only about \u00c2\u00a3210 for 3 nights (top secret hotels are discounted) we thought we'd got ourselves a great deal...until we arrived. Our first impressions of the hotel building when we arrived was that it looked drab and unimpressive from the outside. Once inside, the reception and lounge looked more like what I'd expect from a 4 star hotel, clean, spacious and reasonably modern. After checking in with one of the receptionists (who, like most Amsterdammers, spoke perfect English) we headed off to our room. As soon as the lift doors opened, a powerful, musty smell hit us (if you've ever opened a cupboard full of clothes thats been shut for months, you'll know the smell). When we reached our room, the same smell was waiting for us as was an extremely dated decor and furniture. Whilst I don't know the hotel's history, the smell alone convinced me that it had probably been shut for some time before our stay, though why it wasn't possible for the staff to clean the place or at least air it out properly is beyond me. The biggest shock I had was the state of the bathroom. The ceiling was covered in dirty brown tidemarks which suggested that upstairs had flooded at some point in the past. The sink was covered in cigarette burns and the hairdryer that was fixed to the wall had turned a yellow/brown colour from age. There was also a cheap looking paper lampshade in the bedroom which had a huge tear in it, again, why couldn't the staff replace or remove this before our stay??? At this point, I reflected that if this hotel had been advertised as 1 or 2 star or if it had been incredibly cheap, I would have been feeling really depressed that I couldn't afford better. As it was. I just felt angry at being ripped off. In need of a beer, I opened the minibar to be confronted by an empty fridge. I rang reception to let them know the minibar was empty but they informed me it was supposed to be empty! After fruitlessly looking for a room service menu, I rang them to order a salad and ask if they could bring up a menu while they were at it, they told me they had no menus! Incidentally, I really couldn't fault the food we had, however, if you've been to the Dam before, you'll know that they take good food seriously. The next morning I walked into the bathroom to discover the reason for the tidemarks on the ceiling. There was a small but steady drip coming from the ceiling which had left the floor soaking wet. I rang reception to let them know, genuinely thinking that someone may have flooded their bathroom above us. The manager arrived and told me he'd investigate the problem and warned me that we may have to change rooms. This wasn't a problem as any other room woul;d have been an improvement on the one we were in. After waiting for 2 hours for him to come back we got fed up and decided to head to the city centre (he never returned throughout our stay, the drip kept dripping and we never changed rooms). Next disapointment for us was discovering that the free bus service to the city centre was non-existent (though it did apparently run in the past). This infuriated me as the sole reason we chose this hotel over another similar hotel advertised on Lastminute was the free shuttle service which could have saved us at least a hundred euros on taxis and buses. This is quite simply false advertising and at worst, obtaining money by deception! On a similar note, the hotel was advertised as having tea/coffee making facilities, needless to say, this was another lie. Would I return to this hotel? Never. Would I recommend this hotel to anybody? Not if I liked them.

So get your grocery supplies from the main city before you go to sleep overnight 2. To get to the ferry, just walk to the opposite side of the central station, and you will find it. Or ask for information at the central station. 3. To avoid getting lost on the walk from the ferry to the hotel, DO NOT LOOK AT THE MAP ! It is confusing.

Taxi's into the centre ranged from 10 - 15 Euro's which isn't too bad but can mount up over the weekend. My biggest gripe was the room service - or rather lack of it! In the lifts, there were lists explaining what food & drink etc could be delivered 24/7 but both times we tried, we were told service had stopped as it was too late. Admittedly, it was 4.30am each time but 24/7 should mean just that. Breakfast was ok - Sausages were very undercooked and the toaster was rubbish but the bacon, scrambled eggs etc were fine. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for business travellers or couples exploring rather than the 'Lad's weekend' we were on as it's just too far away from the centre. ps.. We had a great meal in the Karma Sutra indian restaurant on Saturday night. Great food at a good price.

Taxi to city centre is about 13 Euro. Prefer this location to one downtown as it's quieter, but still everything is easily accessible. Good food in various restaurants around the hotel. Front Desk Service: very efficient. Vincent and Kimberly are especially friendly and helpful. Look out for long lines of Northwest airlines staff checking in and out though. Rooms: Large, clean and comfortable. Television stations are mostly english, and there's also PPV. Bathrooms are large as well, with all the usual ammenities. Hydromassage shower head is a plus. Rooms lack a minibar, but there is 24hr room service. A/C does not get very cold even when on max, but the temp is still comfortable. Pillow menu is nice, and the beds are super comfortable.

After staying in some run-down B&B's, this was a refreshing change. We were travelling on a budget, but wanted to spend just a little more money while in Amsterdam and enjoy a hotel. It was SO worth it. The non-smoking room was big, with a fridge, TV, safe, etc. Everything was dark wood, very clean and felt fancy for our usual budget accomodations! They even have the option to request a different types of pillows with different fillings! I felt like a wealthy business-woman, without paying a hefty price. We stayed for 5 nights and loved it. There were 2 ways to get to the city center: NH has a FREE shuttle that would run about every 15 minutes from noon to 10 pm to/from their other NH Barbazon Hotel that is just across from Central Station, or you could walk about 10 minutes to get to a FREE ferry that will take you across the IJ waterway (about a 3 minute ride) that gets you to Central Station. The ferry runs 24 hours a day. The only thing to remember, that we were never told, is that going from Central Station back in the direction of the hotel, there are 3 or 4 different ferries, so be sure you get on the one going straight across to Buiksloterweg - I think that's the name of the street. Sometimes we opted to do the walking down to the ferry, because one of the shuttle drivers had a little attitude and wasn't always the most polite guy, so when we didn't want to deal with it, we took the ferry. The only 2 bad things I can say about the hotel is that when we walked into the lobby and elevator area, it always smelled funny - like sulfur, sewer, cooking beans... we weren't sure what it was, and that when we wanted just a little butter with a butter knife for some bread we bought at the store, we could only do it through room service is it was an insane price for a little butter, so we just went without. The people at the front desk were always helpful... oh, and the bathrooms are wonderfully large and clean, and I enjoyed a relaxing bath every night.

We were able to obtain a good package from Expedia flying directly from Boston via Northwest and staying at NH City North. This was our fourth trip to Amsterdam. Knowing Amsterdam, it was easy for us to take the train to Central Station, to transfer to the ferry to the north side and transfer to a bus to the hotel. Our total elapsed time was about 3/4 of an hour. Our only downside was that the Northwest crews stay at the hotel and are given priority at check in. They become upset if they have to wait 10 minutes although we had to wait 3 1/2 hours. This is a downside. The hotel is new and all of the rooms seem to be the same so that we had an extremely nice room even though we had a deal. Our room was far above basic with nice furnishings and it was \"Clean\". The area is an upscale residential area with adequate places to eat in the area. The hotel cafe was quite good and reasonable. Other than the check in downside the staff was very good and helpful. We enjoyed our stay and will stay there again. I think, probably, the NH chain is the best in Amsterdam but they miss the boat when they discrinate against their customers other than airline crews.

As the hotel has been built in the Noord, which has more space for development, the rooms are of a decent size and there are elevators unlike many hotels in the main part of the City. The only drawback is the location of the Hotel. It is not in the main body of Amsterdam but is located in the Noord, across the river. This means that from (Amsterdam) Centraal Rail Station you have to take the passenger ferry, located immediately outside (Centraal) on the river side, which is free of charge and goes 24hrs a day, every 6 minutes during the day. This ferry takes around 1 minute to cross and then it is a simple 10 minute walk straight along the road to the hotel.
