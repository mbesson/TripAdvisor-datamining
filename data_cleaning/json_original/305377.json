However, I still shocked when I saw the room. It's really small, especially the bathroom. But I think that is the only problem, cause the staff are great, location is superb, and I didn't spend much time in the room anyway, so eventually the small room was not a problem anymore. From the airport, I took Airport express, and then take a cab for just about HK$30. You can also take Airport bus no A21, the bus stop is only 10m away from the hotel. For breakfast, there is a lot of small restaurant near the hotel, with great food and not expensive. Overall, really loved staying here. I'll recommend this hotel for single/couple, but not for family, and honeymooners.", "Date": "Nov 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR816643231", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Tesa_Bdg"}, {"Content": "Always have a lovely time there Stayed there twice and both was as a single occupant.

My friend and I had a fantastic stay. We were greeted with polite reception, who tried their best to meet our room preferences. Upon arrival, my friend's luggage's passcode lock was faulty and refused to open. Desperate, we went down to the front desk to borrow a plier or screwdriver we could break the lock with. Instead, they offered to send a handyman to help us open the bag. He opened the lock within minutes. Throughout our stay, the hotel personnel attended to all our problems immediately, may it be setting our TV channels, or recommending the best places to eat. When we left, they even hailed a cab for us. As for room condition, it was clean and brightly lit, which gave us a comfortable feeling. The room was smaller than we expected, but sufficient for us. Location was very very strategic, right in front of Nathan Road. We could walk to Tsim Sha Tsui and Yau Ma Tei from the hotel. The MRT is barely a stone's throw away. There is also a very good Chinese cafe around the corner, with very good bubble tea. We grabbed a cup on the way back to the hotel every night.Overall, we're very very happy with the hotel.", "Date": "Aug 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR501297659", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "HolidayPooh"}, {"Content": "Good value for Hong Kong My husband and I stayed here in April for 2 nights on the way to Europe and in June for 2 nights on the way home. Booking it through Agoda on the Net, we paid $A126 per night in April and around $A92 in June per night. Judging by other hotel prices in Hong Kong, although as others have commented that the rooms are small, we have stayed in smaller in Europe. The staff were courteous, helpful and the hotel was clean and comfortable. The buffet breakfast was only $HK55 (almost $A8) each and the transfer from the airport to hotel was reasonable although it was cheaper from hotel to airport with the same company, strangely enough. If you want to stay in an area typically Chinese more like the old China, then this area of Jordan is that. The MTR is just around the corner although make sure you ask the hotel for a map with directions on as we got lost taking the wrong exit at first. If you want some good quality and reasonably priced shops, rather than the touristy areas, catch the MTR two stops to Mong Kok where the locals shop. We found a multi-level shopping plaza where we did most of our shopping, called Langham Plaza with great specialist shops as well and great coffee shops.", "Date": "Jul 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR410683264", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Trav11"}, {"Content": "Little problem at Largos       Pool area but not of Largos Hotel : )", "Date": "Jun 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR782077168", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "nic2k6y"}, {"Content": "Just Right Hotel!

The rooms, while fairly clean, are very small indeed and in need of renovation. The carpet was threadbare in places, paintwork in the bathroom was flaking and the decor was very old fashioned. The net curtains were filthy. There is no safe in the hotel room and valuables must be left at reception.There is no room service whatsoever. You can get breakfast from the Mayfair Cafe on the first floor, but it is of poor quality and is vastly overpriced (HK$55 including service charge).There is no Internet connection available in the room and the television on offer is extremely poor. Not so bad if you're only using this as a place to sleep on a quick stopover. Becomes a major problem if you're staying for longer than a couple of nights (On a work trip, for example). Mini-bar is understocked containing only beer (HK $36 for a small can), water and soft drinks. Though there is a 7/11 a few doors down the road, so can't really complain about this too much.The muzak piped into the lifts was enough to provoke a killing frenzy.On the plus side, the staff are friendly and polite. And the location really is good.Overall, you can do much better for the money. Only consider this hotel if you are staying for a very short period of time, the location really appeals or if you can't get a room at The Eaton (A far superior hotel in a very similar location).", "Date": "Jan 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR584348586", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Gurnox"}, {"Content": "Nice Hotel       a view from our window", "Date": "Sep 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR871469718", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "travelogista"}, {"Content": "conveniently located I have spent 5D4N in Hong Kong last June with friends and stay in Mayfair.

The room, however, is the size of the average home bathroom. The Bathroom is the size of the average home WC, lacking a closing door for privacy - a sliding one is the only protection from prying eyes.The room key (when given the right one) is tricky to work and relies not on an actual key mechanism, nor a swipe card, but a plastic tab with holes punched in it which requires jiggling to work. The television channels offered are awful by Asian standards.Considering the price of the room puts this is in the middle range of Hong Kong hotels, much more should be expected than is delivered.
