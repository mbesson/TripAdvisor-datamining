As you'll read, there are several floors going through a renovation right now but it caused minimal disturbance. The renovated rooms were very impressive, especially for New Orleans. I've stayed at many of the hotels in the New Orleans area and came to expect musty dated rooms. You won't find that here. All three of our rooms had a front living room with flat screen tv's and couches. Next was the bathroom area with the small kitchenette. The shower was nice and large with plenty of flow on the 9th floor. Lastly was the bedrooms that had a king size bed and flat screen tv. The bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning worked very well. I wouldn't think twice about staying there again. The rooms were nice and new, the staff was friendly and the Ritz facilities were exceptional. One side note, don't expect much from the breakfast buffet. It was really just fruit and muffins. I would suggest venturing over to the Ruby Slipper Cafe for breakfast or brunch.

The suite smell fresh and was decorated lovely. There was a granite wet bar as well as granite in the bathroom with lovely tile work.

Bourbon street is one block down and Canal is one block over. Check-in The check-in was smooth, we prepaid for the room, so we just left a credit card for incidentals.There is a makeshift desk on the ground floor on the iberville st side but the staff was very friendly and helpful during the entire trip. We had small bags so we carried them to our room ourselves. When we first arrived we were on the dreaded 6th floor that required us to go to the 5th floor walk for about a minute or two and then get in another bank of elevators to go to the 6th floor. This didn't last long and we asked to moved to a different floor. We were moved to the 5th floor rom 506 and it was close to the elevator so this was nice. The only problem with being on the 5th floor is that you hear alot of foot traffic from people walking by trying to get to those 6th floor elevators. We weren't in the room much but I thought I should mention this. Also we never heard any construction and we were here for 4 days/3nights. Dining/Room Service We didn't order room service and I can't even say that I saw a menu for it. We did eat in M Bistro next door in the Ritz Carlton. The wait for a table was horrible. Did I say horrible? Yes horrible but the food and our waitress made up for it. Granted we were here during the Essence Festival so I expect things to be backed up but this place was not packed. We waited at the podium almost 5 minutes before anyone acknowledge us and a manager even walked by us and never said anything to us. I would have appreciated him saying that he was working on a table or that he was trying to find out what the hold up was but we got nothing. If you come here please try the shrimp and grits or the jambayla empanades. Both were really good appetizers. I would highly recommended coming here and the great thing is that you don't have to leave the hotel as the two of them are connected. Room We had a 1br suite with a Queen bed. The Queen sized bed was very comfortable, we had a view of the courtyard. The pull out sofa was very had according to my girlfriends. We called housekeeping and they brought up some additional linens in an attempt to cushion the bed. There is a smal refridgerator and two tvs in the suite. There is also a sink in the living room area of the room. The bathroom was nice, they use bath and body works products. The shower however leakes and we had to keep putting towels down on the floor to soak up some of the water. Valet/bellman We used them to get a cab on two occasions and they were helpful. They also stored our bags until it was time for us to leave and they had a cab ready for us at the time that we told them we needed to leave for the airport. Check-out This was easy as we had no additional charges. The hotel is very serious about their Noon Checkout. There is no video check out so you have to go downstairs. At about 11:59, housekeeping knocked on the door to see if we were still in the room. We told them that we would be out of the room within the next minute or two. I have to give you a heads up, when we were leaving there was a sign on the building saying it was changing to a Marriott Courtyard/Iberville. I would definitely recommend this hotel and feel free to contact me if you have any questions.", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clermont, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Value.....

We had 2 couples, and had a 2 room suite that was clean, perfect french quarter location, and we got to use the pool and spa and fitness facilities of the Ritz Carlton. Check in was a breeze, the staff was all very friendly and whenever we needed anything, we got it very timely. Our room was a tad older, yet it was clean, no odd smells and really very charming for the french quarter. If i wanted modern, i would have stayed at a New Canal Street Hotel. The room has minial frills but thats was fine with us. They do offer room service, which we did not use. We got a comfy bed, a roomy room and bathroom and the TVs worked!! The continental breakfast is very very basic... muffins (3-4 different types), juice, coffee, bananas, apples and thats about it but seriously, there are so many inexpensive little neighborhood diners for breakfast I was eager to eat at, this was not an issue. We did grab a muffin or 2 which made a good snack later! The gym facilities where flawless, the pool was indoor and small but refreshing...the hot tub was nice after a long day walking! We also enjoyed the lobby sitting areas of the Ritz Carlton as this hotel is attached to it. I did note a \"Courtyard By Marriott\" coming soon Sign on the Iberville Side and they are redoing the lobby of the Iberville so I am guessing, they are about to change over soon. I got my room for 99.00 a night thru the Iberville Website and this was a bargain for 2 couples to share the 2 room suite!! The rollaway in the living room made our situation work well. The location is 1 block from the Canal Street end of Bourbon Street so we were right in the Quarter and yet the Canal Street and St Charles Street Cable Cars were right out front thru the Ritz Carlton Side...

The water pressure and hot water didn't always work so well. I think they turn it down or off during the day as there is no hot water much less water pressure. Take your shower in the morning or evening! Breakfast was not worth it at all. Coffee was really bad which is unusual in New Orleans. Banana was the best thing! The bar in the Ritz was very nice but drinks are a little pricey. Overall, I would stay here again for a comparable rate. Eat at Deanies across the street but be prepared for a long wait.

After reading many reviews about this hotel, I knew what to expect before we even boarded our flight to MSY. Location - Perfect. A couple of blocks away from Bourbon and the streetcars on Canal. Once you get to the French Quarter you realize just how compact the area is. Even a hotel like this, which is technically on the outskirts of the Quarter, is literally a two minute walk from all the tourist activity on Bourbon. The area surrounding the hotel was perfectly safe and we never felt threatened at all. I read many reviews that questioned the safety of this area, but those warnings turned out to be unjustified. Staff - We found the staff to be accommodating and friendly. No issues with rudeness or surliness. The valets outside were always eager to talk and greet us, same with the clerks at the front desk. The Hotel - Although the lobby is quite beautiful and spacious, our room needed a complete renovation. The furniture was worn, the television, although we did not even turn it on, was probably 15 years old, and the walls were in dire need of a paint job. The couch in the room had rips in it, the dresser was missing a handle, the bed was uncomfortable, the blankets were pretty much garbage, and the carpets were permanently tarnished due to age. With all that being said, and I know it may be hard to believe, but we had no real issues with the room. It was fine for us and our needs. I would absolutely stay at this hotel again. It's really all about your expectations. No, this hotel is not the nicest in the Quarter, but it certainly not the worst. It's not the Ritz-Carlton, which coincidentally is right next door, but it's not a Super 8 either. We have no regrets about staying at The Iberville Suites.

I'd like to put these reviews in perspective, having observed the hotel with those reviews on my mind. 1. Superficial hotel appearance: very nice once you find your way to the Iberville! It's hidden inside of the Ritz Carlton, and although I entered on Iberville St. where the sign for the hotel is, I could not get to Reception b/c I did not have a key card to use the elevator! i had to walk around to the Ritz, and got hopelessly lost in their maze of corridors and different elevators. Very nice lobby areas and fitness center, except for the cockroach strolling across the 1st floor fountain lobby. (But it's New Orleans and the buggers are everywhere down there. No sign of bugs anywhere else.) The Iberville lobby, on the 2nd floor, was very nice looking, with lots of seating areas, eating tables, and a single computer station that's pretty horribly slow, with a free printer if you want to print boarding passes or the like. Another reviewer mentioned a funny smell in the lobby - I admit, I smelled something as well, sort of an industrial cleaner or chemical odor, but couldn't quite place it. It's not so strong as to be problematic, but it is noticeable when you come off the elevator. 2. Room appearance and amenities: The room is a full fledged econo-suite - you walk in to see a little kitchenette (with coffee maker and mini-fridge) on one side, then enter a little sitting area with couch and TV. Then you pass to the main bedroom area, which also has a TV. Around the corner is a little desk area, before entering the bathroom. My bathroom was HUGE with lots of unused space. At quick glance, the bathroom was really nice with stone floors and everything in muted stone brown/tan colors, with nice Bath & Body Works soaps, etc and a huge number of towels. However, on closer inspection, you could see the wear and tear on the sink, which was very small without much usable space and looked old and worn. There were wear spots around the edges of everything in the bathroom and the bedroom. Towels were thin and small. Back in the suite area, the carpets were clean and vacuumed, but looked very old and worn, with stains here and there, as noted by other reviewers. The bed appeared nicely made up with white sheets and attractive matching bedspread and throw pillows. And lots of pillows, which is usually a good sign. Yes, internet is $13 a day so I didn't use it and couldn't find any nearby free wi-fi points. Yes, the view stinks - mine overlooked a parking garage. I think the Ritz just stuck this economy hotel on its ugly side to attract economy clientele. 3. Room comfort: The bed sagged and I could feel the springs a bit. I have a bad back, and the bed was not so horribly saggy that I couldn't sleep on it, but it was not the most comfortable I've experienced. The pillows were nice and cushy. Sheets were scratchy and thin, and had an industrial detergent odor that was a bit off-putting. A clock-radio alarm with CD player is included. The couch was comfortable enough to sit and watch TV (an old CRT) - I brought a throw blanket to cover the couch, more because of germs but the couch was a tad scratchy as well. My room was perfectly clean the entire stay, no complaints there, unlike a few other reviewers. Guess it depends which maid you get. 4. Breakfast: typical. NO SIGN OF WAFFLES, unlike reported previously. Bagels, bread, muffins (gross), cereal, yogurt, tea, apples, coffee, orange juice. So more food than reported by some but less than by others - maybe it varies? Nice large eating area seemed to accommodate everyone. 5. Fitness center is provided by the Ritz. It has spring water if you want to bring a bottle to refill. Decent size and separate rooms for cardio versus weight equipment, plus a separate room for doing your personal mat-based workout. Pool and jacuzzi. Got a little crowded a few mornings between 7 and 8. Seems abandoned in evenings. 6. Location: Iberville St and Dauphine is located one block north of Bourbon St. The neighborhood is a little dicey after dark, I didn't feel comfortable as a single woman walking around with a purse by myself. Go down just 2-3 blocks (NOT on Bourbon St!) to Royal and Chartres and you'll be in a nice touristy area. 7. Summary: Everything is relative - if you expect nothing more than the Days Inn, you'll be pleasantly surprised. However, since it's attached to the Ritz, maybe you'll expect it to be higher end, so you might be disappointed by the state of the rooms. As usually is the case, the truth lies in the middle of the extreme reviews provided by travelers on this site. There are pros and cons, yes, its a bit worn down looking and could use refreshing, but given the price and location combo, this place is a pretty darn good value for being so close in proximity to great New Orleans attractions.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIt is a good place to sleep...\u201d", "Author": "skittishsquirrel", "ReviewID": "UR127778695", "Content": "If we had intended to spend much time in the room I wouldn't have been very pleased.

Our visit started off a little rocky because we had booked a double room and were given a single. We had booked through travelocity and were very lucky we had because they had records of our initial reservation and called on our behalf to straighten it out. I was annoyed that when we tried to correct the error ourselves we were told by the person at the front desk that there were no double rooms available but when travelocity called suddenly a double room was available. It was a bad start to feel like we'd been lied to or at the least the front desk had been unnecessarily uncooperative. Nonetheless, the problem was corrected and from then on everything went smoothly. The room itself was nice and I loved that there was a little divider between the two beds to give each person a little bit of privacy. The only thing that was bad about it though was that my sister couldn't see the television at all from her bed, so from a design perspective it was kind of stupid, but we didn't watch much TV anyway. The room was clean, comfortably and nicely decorated. The shower was great - and we showered twice a day because of the heat! The Iberville shares a building with the Ritz Carlton and it was cool having their spa and restaurants on site as well. We spent almost our entire vacation outside of the room and this was a good home base location because everything was in walking distance. Of course, what is within walking distance changes based on the weather and during our visit it was crazy hot and humid (especially coming from the Pacific Northwest) so some of the walks seemed long and exhausting. We were no more than a mile or so from any of the things we wanted to do in the French Quarter, but towards the end of our trip started using taxis for the short drives because it was so blasted hot. The hotel offered a continental breakfast each morning which we only tried twice but it was good. In fact the malted waffles were delicious. For a free breakfast it was great - they just had the standard stuff but it's always nice to get a free breakfast, though in New Orleans eating is so much a part of the trip we didn't want to waste it on yogurt and orange juice from concentrate! The hotel lobby is really nice and we sat and planned out our day a couple of times which was really fun.

The suite was definitely a very nice size. The furniture and decor were definitely outdated, but the room/linens/bathroom were clean, something I am extremely picky about when staying in hotel rooms.

They were extremely helpful and incredibly nice. They did the best they could to help us out and were always just as nice as could be, especially a gal named Shelita. With the problems I had with my hotel room and that of the others that stayed there, she tried her best to help us with the problems and was always just as nice as can be. She put the problems into the file under my record and asked me to follow up with the manager in the morning. She followed up with me on the problems in my room the following night when I called to let them know that they hadn't fixed the problem and there was water on the floor again as well as, the problems with the key cards that continuously ceasing work (even the one that stayed in my wallet the entire time wouldn't work) and she asked me to please speak with a manager before I left, which I was hesitant to, but did the day we were leaving. The Spa at the Ritz is absolutely incredible and I had a wonderful experience there. It is sort of attached to the Iberville Suites. Sadly, that's about all the positives that I can say for the hotel. The lobby or even the bathrooms in the lobby of this hotel don't represent the rest of the hotel AT ALL. Issues at the hotel: Two different days I had water all over the bathroom floor, due to a leaky faucet. James, from the Ritz, came over to try to help but told me it would be partial day job that they had to get inside my faucet. He said they'd be back during the day, the next day, to fix it. However, I came back from my meetings the following evening to a soaked bathroom floor again. The same night at the original water incident, I came back to find black soot and crumbles of 'something' all over my makeup and what I had on the little vanity in the bathroom. It ended up that they changed a light in the vanity and that was what came out of the light as they were unscrewing it and they just left it all over my makeup and such. The hotel itself is old and really needs to be updated. The beds were hard as rocks and after three days I am exhausted upon arriving home. The tv's are the huge old box tv's and four of my channels on the bedroom tv didn't even have sound! When I arrived on the first day, I had two dirty towels, with what looked like recent make up removal stains on them, were hung over the towel rack. It made me wonder if the sheets had been changed if the towels didn't look like they'd been washed. On the last day of our three day stay, I went to use one of the wash cloths and it took had stains on it that were extremely apparent that also looked, again, like ladies makeup removal stains. This picture is posted attached to the file. I tried to get a good picture but the lights were dim in the bathroom. For the conference that we were on, we were placed at this hotel and if I'd been able to transfer to another hotel (our convention was spread out at 6 or 7 different hotels) I would've moved and probably should've after my first night in this hotel. It truly is a shame because the team they have working there are so incredibly nice, it's just a shame that the product they are working with, isn't as nice. The day I left, I did speak to the front desk about the problems I had with my room, as Shelita had asked me to do, and the gal at the front desk tried for several minutes to find an available manager, but she couldn't find any of the managers that were on duty to help her, but the one thing she did do was to give me half off the first night I had the water problems.

We were attending an event at the Ritz Carlton, but the Ritz Carlton could not accomodate. 1/3 of the rooms at the Ritz Carlton were closed due to changing out the carpets, drapes, bedding etc. The reservations agent at the Ritz Carlton suggested the Iberville Suites and she made the reservation for us. We were astounded at the $129.00 rate for the King Suite. We had room 508 overlooking the roof. It was nice having a separate bedroom and the 2 televisions. The bed was comfortable. There were a few small issues, such as mildew in the shower caulk and grout, the towel racks coming out of the wall, and the GFCI tripping whenever anyone took a shower . That prevented the hair dryer from working until you reset the GFCI and the breaker on the hair dryer itself. The big issue was the inability to lower the thermostat to a more comfortable temperature. The room was very warm but the temperature could not be lowered, nor could the fan speed be increased. The room was designated non-smoking so we were surprised to see a cigarette burn in the bedspread. At check in we noticed The Market just next to the front desk. We planned to pick up a few snacks when we came back from dinner, but The Market was closed and there was no one at the front desk. It was only 8:00pm. We did not eat the Continental breakfast because everything contained gluten and we are on GF diets. We walked over to the Ritz Carlton and had the American Breakfast. The service was slow, but the food was good. When we returned to our room around 8:15am I tried to call the front desk to ask about late check out. The phone rang 10 times with no answer. I tried several more times and never could get anyone at the front desk to answer the phone. We checked out at noon and left our bag with the bellman.

They had stayed there before so they knew what to expect. They knew the price we were paying was a good deal. This was a pretty spacious suite for New Orleans from what I understand. If you compare it to other larger suites in other cities you might be a bit disappointed by the size. We felt there was plenty of room. There were just two of us in the room, but we could have fit four in this room without a problem. The front area had a desk, a fold out couch, a tv, a wet bar and a very good little fridge (great to have cold water before you go to bed at night). The bathroom was on the small side, but I have seen MUCH smaller bathrooms when traveling so I was not bothered by this at all. The bedroom area had another desk, an armoire which held the tv and a nice king size bed with lots of pillows and two nightstands. There was still plenty of room to walk around the bed. The other great thing about this room was the bedroom was at the back of the room so you were far away from \"hall noise\". We only heard one group on one night, but they quickly moved on. The only complaint I really had was the suite was pretty dark. They had lots of lamps, but they gave off low light. This was our second trip to New Orleans and for a similar price we had a very, very tiny room last time. We were very happy with this one. The hotel staff was fine. They were not overly friendly, but they were far from rude. The hotel lobby is nice. This is where they have their breakfast area. We did not try their breakfast though as we went out to eat each morning, but it looked like many people enjoyed it. We also did not try the pool or hot tub.

The extra \"room\", is a tiny alcove that fits a pull out couch that is slightly larger than a twin sized bed, but not as big as a double. Not suitable for 2 people to sleep on. Even two small people. Our alcove wasn't even big enough for the couch to be pulled out. Fully extended, the bed hit the cabinet the tv was on.

I just got off the phone with Maria Mills, GM of Iberville Suites and am utterly astonished by what I just went through. On my final day at Iberville I noticed that my Bose headsets I'd been using in the room were missing. I immediately went down to the front desk to speak with management. They had a \"loss prevention\" official on site who came to the room, saw the empty Bose case, and mentioned to me that room thefts did occur at Iberville. They created a claim number with Mariott. Once I returned home I got a call from Mariott a week later stating they were investigating the claim. The woman on the phone was incredibly rude and took the time to tell me that they did not assume any level of liability for room break ins. Just today, nearly three weeks after my trip, the GM of Iberville called and said Mariott denied the claim. He said he'd credit back one night to us, which is $129. Mr. Mills and the Mariott Corporation miss the point entirely. We spent over $2,500 at that hotel alone. We frequently stay at Mariott hotels for business. Over a $299 set of headphones, something that could have been resolved in a moment, they have lost us for life. Ok, so about the hotel on the whole. On day 1 I arrived at the room and the smoke detector was beeping regularly from a low battery. I called downstairs and they said they'd send someone within minutes. Over an hour later I called down again. The woman at the front desk said, \"I don't know anything about it.\" They had apparently gone through a shift change, and nobody had noted my call. 30 minutes later, they repaired it. Also, wifi throughout the hotel was down during that first day. They sent a staff member to my room to troubleshoot for an hour with me. Concierge was the only plus. Very friendly people down there. So, to summarize. Iberville and Mariott don't value customers. Hours of phone calls, and zero resolution. Room thefts happen at Iberville with some regularity. In addition to my loss, the gentleman who visited my room had a notepad full of individuals who'd complained of theft. Yes, Mariott & Iberville...settling this 'claim' would have represented $299 of your hard earned cash. Instead you chose to end a 3 year old relationship with my company.

We got a great deal on hotels dot com of $69 per night. We arrived on July 4th and had a rental car. We could not find the entrance at first and then realized the entrance was under construction. The only thing we saw was a valet stand for the Ritz Carlton. We parked our car in a garage around the corner that we had coupons for (was supposed to make parking $10 per night... but the machine was programmed not to accept the coupon code on holidays... we found free street parking for the night since meters aren't in effect on holidays and then got up early the next morning and moved our car to the Amtrak lot which was a 20 minute walk, but worth it since it was only $5 per night). The Ritz Carlton bellman showed us to the entrance to the Iberville Suites (which is right next to the Ritz Carlton entrance) and told us to take the elevator up one floor to the Iberville Suites lobby. Upon entering the lobby I was very impressed. From previous reviews I thought it was going to be small and dark, but it was just the opposite. There was a lot of marble in the open spacious lobby. The desk clerk checked us in and pointed us towards the elevator. We had a room on the 9th floor. I was once again pleasantly surprised by the spaciousness and the view! Upon entering the room you are in a living room with a desk, couch and TV. There was a wet bar and mini fridge on the left and a bathroom on the right and you pass through another doorway to the bedroom. (It reminded me of an Embassy Suites layout.) We had a northern facing view of the city. The location of this hotel is ideal. It was great to walk out the door and be on Bourbon Street in just a couple minutes! This proved to be valuable when we had leftover food or other purchases that we wanted to bring back to the hotel and then go out again. Since we were there for 4th of July we walked to the riverfront to watch the fireworks. We also walked to Cafe du Monde, to the Riverwalk shops, the Steamboat Natchez, and the St. Louis #1 cemetery. Once again, GREAT location! Breakfasts in the morning were adequate. The lobby area is spacious enough that we always had a place to sit. As with most hotels the breakfast was a carb-fest, but that's to be expected. You could make your own waffles with a special fleur-de-lis imprint! There were cereals, oatmeal, grits, muffins, bagels, pastries, fruit, yogurt, coffee, tea, milk, juice, etc. You have full free access to the Ritz Carlton facilities upon staying at the Iberville Suites. The gym is great... there is one room with weight machines and another room with cardio machines. There is also a studio room where you could stretch or do yoga. When you use the gym, you are provided with headphones to use if you want them. Towels and bottles of water are also provided. (There were even moist towels and cucumbers for your eyes!) The pool and hot tub are also located in the gym. We used the gym but didn't have a chance to take advantage of the pool or hot tub. If you have your own laptop, free wifi access is provided in the lobby (not in the room). The one night that my husband tried to get online the internet was totally down though. There is one computer in the lobby that you can use, but the internet service is pretty slow. The next time we are in New Orleans, we will try and book this hotel again.

It is a long hike to the Morial Convention Center\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwell over a mile, and about a half-mile to most of the typical tourist areas like the river and Jackson Square. On the other hand, even though it is just one short block from Bourbon St., the hotel is extremely quiet from the hubbub; not many hotels so close can offer that. I always feel safe walking in most of the Quarter and this location feels safe as well and it is one block from Canal Street. My queen suite was on the 10th floor, facing the faux inner courtyard (i.e., no view except the neighbors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 windows, but with good light from the large window). The suite was smaller than I expected. A medium-sized bathroom (with good water pressure), closet, and small bar area (sink and refrigerator) divide the bedroom and the living area. There is a tube television with expanded basic satellite (with HBO) in both rooms. Public areas like the lobby and hallways are attractive and in fine shape. The room was clean with good housekeeping, but the carpet was faded and the furniture was quite nicked-up. It had a pull-out couch, but lacked any other soft chair, even though there would have been room for one. The living room area has no window and is very dark, and noise from the hall is surprisingly intrusive. The bedroom is very quiet, however. The central air conditioner had good comfort adjustability. The main bed was firm and comfortable enough, but not up to the standards now showing up at other mid-range hotels. And that represents the issue with the Iberville Suites: it is not a four-diamond hotel as AAA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rating would suggest, but just a typical three star/three diamond hotel with average amenities. It is not as special as one would expect considering its pedigree of being in the Ritz Carlton family. I noticed there is a microwave oven near the ice machine. This was a surprise to see, and is another issue with the hotel: there is no information in the room explaining services or even fees (such as the internet fee, spa fee, the lone guest computer in the lobby), or even how to maneuver around the hotels. (The Ritz opens onto Canal St., the Iberville onto Iberville St., and the Maison Orleans somewhere in this complex too, but they are all inter-connected inside.) Reasons to consider: if the price is better than other hotels, if the divided room with a couch is appealing, if the pedestrian continental breakfast food suits you, if swimming is not important. Reasons to look elsewhere: internet in the room is $12.95 a day, the continental breakfast is limited and low in protein; the room is small, the small pool is part of the Ritz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health club. The two-stage entrance (elevator to the lobby, down the hall, elevator to room) bothers some people, but is found elsewhere in city hotels and not that bad of a problem. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think this hotel is particularly suitable for children, it just has an adults-only feel about it. I realized later that I could have stayed down the street at a good hotel for $34 a night less and that place included internet. The savings would have bought a nice healthy breakfast of my choosing every day with money to spare. The Iberville Suites wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad, it was just a disappointment from my expectations considering the price.

Problems: - Too expensive for level of quality: superficially, it looks nice inside (and that is ignoring the under-construction exterior). However, the room had no snack bar, an empty mini-fridge that was in college-party-house condition, a big stain on the room door, scuffed and damaged wood below the fridge, very little space (we ordered a \"suite\" but it was the size of a normal room) and an abysmal fold-out bed. - Service: the staff were terrible. The truth is that they didn't seem very bright-- sometimes you just need someone to have independent thought and a little common sense. It's not that we were some whiners or anything, but rather, an accumulation of little things made us feel helpless. - Location: the back-alley entrance smelled like heated trash. The street it is on was one of the dirtiest and smelliest anywhere in the area. Across the street was another hotel (maybe a Marriott?) that was nicer (larger rooms, nicer staff, higher ceilings), was on a corner with better light and less trash-smell, and more affordable. I'm not too bent out of shape-- had a great trip, left the Iberville Suites early despite prepaying and took other rooms elsewhere, and am having fun all around.

The hotel is only one/two blocks away from stops to the Canal St and St Charles Ave streetcar lines. And if you are in N.O. to visit Bourbon St the hotel is only one block away from the bars. The (kinda sorta) cons - the entrance and lobby of the hotel are very luxurious and really set up your expectations so the rooms feel like a big disappointment; I would have liked to see some protein at breakfast (even just a hard-boiled egg); the bedrooms were nice and quiet but if you slept in the front room of the suite, you could hear everything and everyone in the hallways (I an imagine this being a huge issue during Mardi Gras), and the staff was polite but not really friendly. The BIG con - free WiFi only in the lobby, not in the rooms. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Iberville and would definitely stay there again.

All four people said that it shouldn't be a problem & that the request was on our reservation. I was specifically told by one reservation agent at the hotel that they had connecting rooms available i the hotel. When we arrived, the clerk told us that they don't have any connecting rooms. Then we were given rooms on 2 different floors! I explained that we were led to believe that we would be connected, or at least next to each other, but she said that they were booked due to french quarter festival & that was the best they could do. So we were 4 friends traveling together & we had to run up & down the back stairs to see each other. The internet was horrible. We were unable to connect wirelessly the entire time we were there. and once i plugged in, it worked only sporadically. I made them aware of the problem several times, but it was never fixed. Upon checkout, when asked how my stay was, I said the internet worked randomly & they were apologetic, but there was no offer to refund the $34.95 I paid for 4 days of use. It would've been a nice gesture. One more problem I encountered was that on Saturday night I got in later than my roommate & I didn't want to wake her, so I stopped at the front desk to leave a wake-up call for the next day. I asked for the call at 10:15am & the clerk said it was no problem. The next day: no wake-up call. Thank goodness I wasn't going to the airport. I woke up at 10:45 annoyed that I was off to a late start. The location is great. The hotel is quiet, but you're very close to everything. All in all, there are better places to stay.

I booked through hotels.com for $190 per night including taxes and fees. Summary: Pros: Good location Reasonably quiet Competent staff Rooms aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cookie-cutter and are equipped with refrigerator. Good breakfast Clean and well-kept premises Cons: Access to the rooms via two different elevators is a little inconvenient. Extra charge for internet connection in the room Sitting room gets little natural light. Notes on location: I like being a block off of Canal Street in the French Quarter, without being in the middle of the Quarter. Rue Iberville is comparatively quiet (though in New Orleans that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a relative term). For me this location is far preferable to the big tourist and convention hotels on Canal, a street that I find busy, noisy, and overpriced. The Suites are tucked away behind the Ritz Carlton, which faces Canal. I believe the two hotels are associated in some way, including the sharing of a fitness facility, but I did not explore the connection. The Iberville Suites are conveniently located to a number of attractions. Bourbon Street is a block and a half distant. Though the hotel lies close to the southwest edge of the French Quarter, most of the Quarter can easily be reached on foot from there. Among the farthest French Quarter destinations (15 to 20 minutes on foot) would be the French Market on Decatur Street and the gay bar scene on St. Ann Street. However, this location will also situate you within walking distance of the Warehouse District and the National World War II Museum south of Canal Street, in the area of town known locally as the American Sector. (It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a 20 or 25 minute walk to the museum at 945 Magazine Street, which is worth a visit). This was my first trip to New Orleans since before Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and I was pleased to see the inner city humming with activity and few outward indications of economic distress. Most of my favorite restaurants, bars and businesses are still there and thriving. Notes on the hotel and room: The Suites are in a multi-story building arranged in a manner similar to East Coast urban or European hotels. The reception is on the second floor of the building. A doorman will admit you to a small vestibule and elevator landing on the street level, after which you take the elevator to the second floor, traverse the large lobby, and then take another elevator up to the accommodations. The big lobby is (over)decorated in French Provincial or Empire style furnishings and bric-a-brac, but the high-ceilinged space is large enough to accommodate the excess without it being annoying. There are a few computer stations in this area where you can check e-mail and print out a boarding pass. Breakfast is served in one end of the reception area (good variety of cereals, fruits, yogurt and breads but no hot dishes). The room is well-lit in the mornings with large floor to ceiling windows and plenty of tables and seats for a pleasant morning meal, which is included in the price. The hotel has a rambling layout, with long intersecting hallways. I found the elevators adequate and reasonably swift. The floor plan of my suite resembled the arrangement of New Orleans \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shotgun\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd houses\u00e2\u20ac\u201done room wide and multiple rooms deep. The first room off the corridor is a fairly large sitting room with a sofa, easy chairs, a writing desk, a television, and a wet bar with sink and a small refrigerator (yay!). Beyond the sitting room is a hallway with a closet and a bathroom opposite each other. The bedroom is the farthest back, where there is a large window and another television set. This floor plan means that during the day the sitting room receives very little sunlight. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to use the lamps in that room even during the day. It was a cozy place to relax or work on my laptop when I returned in the evening. You should be aware that there is a charge for internet connection in the rooms, close to $10 a day. This may explain why people were sitting downstairs in the reception area with laptops, where apparently free WiFi is available. The single room bath is not huge but not small enough to be considered undersized. The fixtures, including a tub-bath, were in good condition, and there was plenty of hot water and thick towels of good quality. I had a king size bed, which pretty much filled the bedroom. The mattress was average. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had better, but I slept perfectly well on it. The linens were fine, and the d\u00c3\u00a9cor in the suite was French Quarter flavored without being garish. I was pleased with the cleanliness of the suite and of the hotel in general. The view from my 8th floor digs was a mixture of urban ugly (an expanse of flat roof in the foreground) and Old World charm (a view in the distance of the quaint houses on Burgundy Street). I heard very little street noise or interference from other guests, with the exception of a few neighbors down the hall who one night returned from their revelry at 3:00 a.m. and let us all know they were back. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to have any close encounters with New Orleans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 party atmosphere, the French Quarter is not the best place to stay. I did not have a car while there and did not try to use the fitness center at the Ritz Carlton, so I cannot comment on those services. Notes on service and staff: Check-in and check-out were hassle-free with no waiting. The staff was competent and courteous during what little interaction I had with them. I had no complaints about the maid service. Notes on the area, including food: Everyone will discover their own favorite eating places and watering holes in New Orleans. Here are a few finds of my own within walking distance of the hotel, in case you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to try them too. I enjoyed a good, reasonably priced local seafood meal at Oceana Grill, 739 Conti Street, between Dauphine and Bourbon. It was blissfully uncrowded when I went there for an early evening meal, and the service and food were very good. I also had a good time at K Joe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cajun & Creole Cuisine, 720 Rue Saint Louis, between Royal and Bourbon. They have live local music. The food is good, but a bit pricey. Also, you might enjoy the French Market Caf\u00c3\u00a9, across from the French Market at 1000 Decatur Street. This is an unpretentious place with a very friendly bar, and they serve up a great bunch of raw oysters. This is where I learned how correctly to pronounce the name of the local brew Abita (a-BEET-a), of which I drank more than one. The French Market Caf\u00c3\u00a9 is very close to the Central Grocery, also on Decatur Street, which is the prime purveyor of the famous New Orleans sandwich called the muffaletta. I walked there from Rue Iberville one evening hoping to buy one but discovered that the shop keeps standard hours and closes in the late afternoon. So if you want an original muffaletta, go to Central Grocery during the day. There are muffalettas served elsewhere, but most of them don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t measure up. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a short walk from the Suites to the Hotel Monteleone at the corner of Rue Iberville and Royal Street. This hotel is famous for its Carousel Bar, a rotating bar on the ground floor. I had the bartender make me a hurricane, which was smaller than the ones for which Pat O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Brien\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is famous, but for my money it was just as good. I recommend not staying at the Carousel past about six rotations of the bar, in order to make it easier to find your way home. Though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long morning walk from Rue Iberville, the bakery \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Croissant D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Or Patisserie\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at 617 Ursulines Avenue, on the opposite side of the Quarter, is very quaint and enjoyable, with a lot of local clientele. Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Beignet is closer by, serving a mixture of baked goods, including fatty beignets rolled in powdered sugar (the very sight of which may expand your waistline), as well as some hot lunch dishes and soups. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at 334 Royal Street, next to the police station, and has a lovely and secluded outdoor patio that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s considerably less frenetic than the better known Caf\u00c3\u00a9 du Monde. Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Beignet has daytime hours only. I do NOT recommend the Palace Caf\u00c3\u00a9 on Canal Street. It was crowded and noisy, and the service was unfriendly. The food at the Palace was average. Bourbon Street is worth a stroll at night, just to have had the experience of chaotic license. I initially did not feel at all unsafe there, especially because of the police presence, but the later in the night or early morning it is, the dicier the passersby become. After being propositioned by prostitutes and hassled a few times by aggressive young locals after 1:00 a.m. (the kind of people who continue to follow you and even tug on your arm after you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve declined their invitation to give them a cigarette), I avoided Bourbon and chose the parallel street Royal for getting back and forth across the Quarter late at night. Royal Street, one block off of Bourbon, is lined with sedate antique shops (and a police station), and occasionally one runs across an impromptu local band of musicians on a corner, playing for tips. It was some of the best jazz I heard during my visit. On this visit I also took a bus tour of the Lower Ninth Ward and saw the lingering devastation from Hurricane Katrina. The tour included a visit to the new sustainable housing sites, which was very informative. Had it not been for Katrina, I would never have gone to that neighborhood, and I learned a lot. Notes on culture: My favorite thing to be called in New Orleans is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153baby,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which local middle-aged women are inclined to use as a form of address for men or women, even when speaking to strangers. No disrespect is intended. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re interested in a good read with plenty of local color, pick up John Kennedy Toole\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s novel A Confederacy of Dunces and read it on the plane. For me the pros outweigh the cons.

One year they were overbooked at the Iberville, and my parents got moved to the Ritz for the same price. Their location is ideal. 2 blocks away from Bourbon Street... Centrally located to most anything you would want to do or see in NOLA. Before Katrina, it was advertised as an \"All suite hotel\". All the rooms opened to a living room with a pullout sofa, a little wet bar/ microwave counter area and then had a separate bedroom. It was very economical because you could have two groups of people with separate bedrooms for the price of one room... Yes, someone got stuck with the pullout... but it usually works out to 200 bucks a night to get a separate room at a similar hotel... so pullout sofas are more in my budget. Unfortunately, most of my trips to New Orleans do not get me out of bed before 10AM. About my 7th year of staying there, I woke up early enough to realize they have a FULL and FREE breakfast buffet. Scrambled eggs, sausage, ham.... Fruit... You name it. I was amazed! None of the rooms I've stayed in have any kind of view to mention... usually of another wall or some parking garage.... The hotel was closed for an extended period of time after Katrina... Far more than other hotels in the area. I understand they took heavy wind damage. Now that they have reopened, things are pretty much the same... with a few notable exceptions: They are no longer a \"all suite hotel\". Post Katrina they added some standard rooms. When booking, be very careful of what kind of room you are booking. It appears the breakfast has been scaled back to a very nice continental, with no hot food. Prices here are all over the place. I'm usually there for New Years Eve and the Sugar Bowl and have found prices as low as 99.00 and as high as 330.00 per night.... Shop around, Travelocity, Expedia and the http://ibervillesuites... web page are all good places to look.

The location is very convenient, right at the edge of the French Quarter, two blocks down from Bourbon Street. The location was very quiet and was attached to the Ritz Carlton, which was accessible by a little bit of a convoluted route. You can use the workout room at the Ritz for free and the Spa for the listed prices. The suites themselves are not huge but you do have a bedroom which is completely separate from the small sitting area. The bathroom is also rather small. I think that some of the rooms have been more recently refurbished as my daughter' s suite was somewhat better appointed than ours. Also, many of the suites face the interior of the hotel so that you only see windows of other parts of the hotel, so no view. This does make it very quiet since you have no street noise. If you want an outside view, you should ask for it specifically. There were a few issues with our room - one burned out light and chest of drawer handles that came off in our hand. There was mold in the bathtub of our suite, but not in our daughters. We were able to get these fixed the next day, except for the mold. The lobby is very luxurious and the continental breakfast is what you would expect - bagels, rolls, cereal, etc. Good coffee, though. Our rate was quoted at an average of $129/day. But we used valet parking, which you will need if you have a car, which cost an additional $32/day plus tax and tips. The wi-fi didn't work in our room but the DSL did and came at a cost of $13.99/day.

We were very appreciative of their kindness! The following morning, I asked the front desk if anyone had turned in our son's lamb and I also asked the bellmen downstairs if they had seen it.

The room wasn't a suite, it was 2 queen beds, the carpets were soiled, and the tv stand was kind of pulled away from the wall which seemed strange. So when I went to push it back I noticed a rather large rodent trap....it was kind of a white tube I guess designed to trap a rather large rodent(rat, mice, etc..). Ok, so that was a little strange to me especially with how great the reviews were on this hotel. So I call the operator just trying to get some reassurance that I won't wake up with Mickey Mouse in the room with me. I explain why I'm calling and she transfers me back to the front desk where I just checked in only to be told there is nothing they can do.

After we found the front lobby of the Iberville Suites, which is a bit confusing because it is connected to the Ritz Carlton, we began the process of checking in. This was not as simple as it should have been due to the fact that there was no record of our reservation! I am not sure who was in error, the hotel or Travelocity, but it turned out well-they had rooms available. Thanks to Ebony for keeping us calm when we thought we would be sleeping in the lobby!! The next minor glitch occured when we went up to uor room only to find that the bed, which we thought would be a KING sized bed was really more the size of a queen. We returned with our things to the front desk to get another room. The next room we were assigned was no different. We picked up the phone to cal Ebony who came up to our new room to explain that every room was equiped exactly the same. We explained the name KING Suite led us to believe that we would have a KING sizes bed...long story short, we were happy enough with the room. Each room/suite comes with an living room style area that had a pull out sofa, a tv that has cable and a gaming system, a desk with a chair, a floor lamp, an end table with another lamp, another comfy chair, and a wet bar. There is also a nice mini fridge and coffee pot that comes with coffee and additives. There are plenty of electrical out lets and a phone in that area. Drinking glasses anc coffee cups as well as an ice bucket for a trip to the ice machine were also handy. The bathroom was clean and modern. The vanity/sink area was nicely lit and there was a shelf above the basin that gave us extra space to spread out our things. Belive me, two sinks come in handy for two women traveling together, especially when they are trying to get ready for a costume ball! There is a blow dryer in the bathroom, which does help to cut down on your packing. The toilet was easy to flush-no worries with plumbing. The shower was large and clean as well. No signs of mold! The shower head must be a low flow type to conserve on water, and the water never really got hot, but the temperature was fine. There were plenty of towels, toilet paper, kleenex, and nice assortment of Bath and Body soap, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion. There were also cotton balls and cotton swabs. The towels were just the right thickness-and in very good condition. The bedroom area has the bed with night tables and lamps on either side, a large TV in an armoir that contains three nice sized drawers, another large desk/table and a large closet with plenty of hangers, a luggage rack, spare blanket and pillow for the pull out sofa, and a safe for your valuables. The hotel offers room service and wireless access is available for a fee. Guests may use the spa at the Ritz Carlton, but we forgot our swim suits and didn't get to take advantage of that perk- I am not sure, but there may be a small daily fee. The Iberville Suites also shares an amzingly beautiful court yard with the Ritz that we enjoyed each night. There is a complimentary breakfast in the lobby each morning. You can enjoy coffee, tea, orange juice, hot or cold cereals, muffins, bagels, toast and make your own waffles. There are also apples and low fat yougurt. Because we are fans of Cafe DuMonde, we only ate breakfast in the lobby once! The hotel is only a short walk from Bourbon Street, Mena's Palace- a great local place for food, and Canal Street. This was an ideal location for us for the Haloween weekend. We were close enough to everything to walk, and far enough removed from the crowd and noise of the night life. We felt safe at all times every where we went, and we covered a lot of ground that weekend.

You do have to use their valet and there is a cost to it, but we got a package stay and park deal, so it was included. After getting our luggage, we made our way to the beautiful lobby area. The woman at the front desk was very friendly, and when they had us down for a queen suite instead of a king (I would recommend printing your itinerary, as that helped us prove we'd asked for a king), she quickly changed our room. She also took out a map and began writing recommended sites to visit and restaurants to eat at. The first room we went to was strangely locked from the inside, but a member of housekeeping was on the floor at the same time and she called up her supervisor, who got us switched to the room across the hall. The room was very nice, with a couch bed/sitting area, then a refrigerator and sink area, bathroom, and finally the bedroom. We didn't have a view from our room, but that was ok by us. The hotel is in the PERFECT location, we walked to dinner and then walked around the French Quarter and along the river, before returning by way of Bourboun Street. As other reviewers have said, one of the perks of this hotel is that its owned by the Ritz. From 5-9PM on Thursdays and 9PM-1AM on Friday and Saturday, the Ritz has live jazz in their lobby, which is easily accessible by an elevator from the lobby of the Iberville Suites. We only made it to the last half hour of music by the time we got back, but it was a good time, and I would recommend it! The bed was very comfortable, and the breakfast was pretty standard, fruit, cereal, coffee, instant oatmeal/grits, with the exception of the waffle maker, which was a nice addition.

From the valet who we saw when we can and left the hotel (this was the only strange thing with the hotel is the entrance seems to be off an ally where valet is for both Iberville Suites and the Ritz Carlton) to the reception we were always greeted with genuine warmness. The concierge was able to get reservations at a restaurant that was booked for weeks in advance. It was great have a bedroom and a sitting room to spread out - we didn't feel cramped. The rooms were very clean and quiet - I don't think I even heard a door down the hall close. Breakfast is complimentary and includes the usual (cereal, fruit, bagels, muffins) but you can also make waffles fresh if you want and they had fresh squeezed orange juice.

OH, and she also said that we needed to COME BACK over to the Iberville tomorrow, for check-in at 3:00. She filled out a form and and told us to give it to the bellman, and he would escort us to the Chateau. That happened and we finally got into our room at 6 pm.

I must give a special mention to Claudette Breve a senior concierge at Ritz Carlton. If there was such a thing as concierge university then she would be the principal. Claudette really helped make our stay in New Orleans special, I love it when people are this good at their job. The down side to Iberville is there is no view or private balcony but that means its quiet and if we wanted to sit outside we used the court yard at the Ritz which has a table service for the bar. The only other negative is the waste that is created at breakfast time. The self-service breakfast is served with disposable cups, plates and cutlery. All this plastic and polystyrene goes into the same dustbin and is non-recycled. It is not just Iberville that is wasteful it seems New Orleans is quite a waseful city, nearly every shop has it's air-con up full blast then leaves the door open, how dumb is that?

They are opulent, and gorgeous. We were a little nervous about booking a hotel so near Bourbon Street in the French Quarter; the Iberville Suites are just down the street from the raucous area. But our fears were unjustified. Our room was pleasant, and quiet. When we arrived, the front desk staff (a young man named Gersan) was as charming and as friendly as could be. We were checked in quickly and efficiently. (At one point, due to airline issues, we called the Iberville to tell them we might not make our reservation, but they said not to worry, and that they'd hold the room. If we missed one evening, there would be no charge. But we made it just fine.) Our room was a lovely surpirse. After winding our way down a maze of hallways on the 9th floor, we found our room, or rather rooms. Our room had both a bedroom, a sitting room, a tiny kitchen area, and a nice-sized bathroom. Clean? It was spotless, except for the very tired and stained carpet. But we weren't sleeping on the floor, so it didn't matter. The bed was huge, with a great mattress, and lots of plump pillows. A large-screen TV (operating perfectly) sat in an armoire. The small sink and refrigerator were very handy. There was a coffee maker, too, but it was far better to go downstairs during the FREE breakfast and get coffee from an urn, and real cream. Our view from our bedroom window was kind of sad, but we loved it. Typcial New Orleans. The breakfast was varied, and ample. Fruit, juice, cereal, yoghurt, fresh hot waffles, and plenty of breads and pastries were available for a reasonable amount of time every morning. Internet is easily available by logging on to the neighboring Ritz Carlton hotel's service. $12.95/day will be added to your bill, but it is a great and easy-to-use wireless connection. Iberville Suites guests are welcome to use the Ritz Carlton amenitites, but that's not really our thing, so we can't report on spas, gym, or pool. But they are there. Back to the public restrooms, they are so well-appointed and so beautifully laid out, one could live there. Every stall has its own solid door, and the counters and mirrors shine in black marble and gold gilt. The Iberville Suites are at the top of our list for a place to stay in New Orleans. Canal Street is just a block up, and the Jackson Brewery (where you can buy 3-day trolley passes) and the Gray Line Tours \"Lighthouse,\" on Toulouse Street is only about a 15-minute walk away. A cab ride from one side of the French Quarter to the other is about $5 plus a $2 surcharge. But walking is the way to go. Especially walking Royal Street with its wonderful antique and art shops. If you want an okay meal quickly, and you don't mind braving Bourbon Street, La Bayou restaurant is right on the corner. The food is tasty; service is fast. But at nighttime, it is very noisy. We booked our stay through Expedia, A king bed, non-smoking room on the 9th floor was $650 including taxes and booking service fees. Tip #1: Don't take a shuttle from the New Orleans airport to the French Quarter; the wait can be ridiculous (especially when a large convention is in town), and the savings are minimal. Take a cab instead; $28 will cover 2 people. Tip #2: Do take a Katrina tour offered by Gray Line Buses. It is amazing. Our driver was not only a great driver, but he was an amazing speaker.

(hair in the shower from when i shaved the day before) price: for the location and quality i think $80 is a great rate. security: there are safes in the room to place valuables. the room doors has that \"flip over thingy\" (you know where a chain would be) anyway nobody can get in the room when you're there. even with a key. when i slept, i closed and locked the door to the bedroom(from the living room). even outside, being so close to bourbon there's people around. less chance of being 'caught' alone and becoming a victim of something. parking: theres a self parking lot at burgundy and iberville. so from the hotel one block one way is bourbon. one block the other way is this parking lot. (didnt use it dont know the price). theres also another parking lot across the street from the hotel. standing on the balcony in the hotel lobby. toss a rock and you'd literally hit the side of the parking lot building. its valet. breakfast is complimentary. dont hold me to the exact times but for some reason 6-10am is sticking with me. plenty of orange juice. cold cereal with 3 kinds of milk. make your own waffles. begals. muffins. its a nice spread. gets crowded tho and there's not alot of seating. only negatives i can think of is the elevator situation. guess they did the best they could seeing how its more than one hotel combined (joined with the ritz carlton). second negative (to me) would be the low water pressure. all in all i figure, with any hotel, if you look hard enough something can always be found to complain about. in my opinion iberville is a good value. if i can help it this is where i'll stay each time i go to new orleans.", "Date": "April 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cRitz Carlton may own it but that's where it ends\u201d", "Author": "Edmitchell66", "ReviewID": "UR15008544", "Content": "Stayed there prior to Katrina and it was great.

That's likely because it's part of the Ritz Carlton Hotel. Still, the Iberville staff made every effort to satisfy our needs. We checked in early and were able to get a room near our friends who also traveled with us to NOLA, as had been requested when we booked our trip in June. The rooms are well kept, though some look a bit newer than others. Our friends' room had dated carpeting, or at least, it looked dated and a few things were worn or falling apart. In our room, everything looked to be in good shape except the t.v. stand in the bedroom which was slightly broken. PLEASE NOTE: If you're looking for a room with any kind of a view, DO NOT stay here. It seems that all of the rooms at the Iberville face an interior courtyard which really isn't a courtyard but just a roof, or like our friends, you may face an abandoned building next door. MOST IMPORTANTLY: Do not stay here if you are looking to have some fun and enjoy your trip by having some drinks, etc. in your room. We checked into the hotel on a Thursday around 1 p.m. and went out for the afternoon in the French Quarter. We returned a few hours later and showered and then the four of us were having a couple of drinks in our room, listening to some music that was not very loud and all of a sudden at 7:30 p.m. (yes, I said 7:30 p.m.), we got a knock on our door. I opened the door and two gentlemen from the Ritz were standing there with ear pieces in. They said that they got a complaint that we were being loud and asked us to keep it quiet. Needless to say we were livid that we couldn't even have some drinks and chit chat at 7:30 p.m. on a Thursday. The hotel is in the French Quarter of New Orleans. Perhaps some of the hotel's residents should stay in a nursing home instead. How ridiculous. We're all adults (30-35) and don't carry on like college kids on Bourbon St. so this issue definitely left a bad taste in our mouths. We will not be staying there for any return trips to NOLA, which is too bad because the hotel price was right when we booked it ($130 roughly) six months in advance and it's proximity to Bourbon St. and the rest of the French Quarter is excellent. Unlike many other hotels near Bourbon, you cannot hear anything once you are in your room/bed. However, be warned that any kind of socializing in your rooms must be done at a library's level.

The glass and the debris on the floor remained untouched until the fourth day of my stay! The complementary breakfast was minimal, with plenty of carbohydrates and no fruit.

Our room was not in keeping with our own expectations however. I had booked a Kingsize room and was given a Standard. If you are used to sleeping on the Kingsize at home, a Standard at a hotel just doesn't work. Our Standard matress was so worn out that it sagged in the middle. Neither of us got a decent sleep the first night there. In the morning, I almost slipped in the bathtub while showering because there was no bathmat or antislip strips in the tub. The carpet in the room was not properly cleaned, and the counter tops had dirt and grime on them. I addressed our complaints to the front desk clerk, and asked to speak to the manager. The manager was \"not in,\" so we had to wait until someone came to work. ( I was dismayed that the hotel is run by people who can't make decisions, and no management is there to guide them until they \"come in\".) I had to call the agency that I booked the hotel through before I got a response from a manager. The assistant operations manager was very apologetic about the condition of the room, and guaranteed that all would be taken care of while we were out seeing the sights for the day. When we arrived in the afternoon, we were once again disappointed, because our room had not been cleaned in the six hours that we had been gone. Once again, I called to speak to a manager. The response was very rapid this time. An attendant was sent within 5 minutes to start cleaning our room. The assistant ops manager came up in person to appologize. She offered us a Non-smoking room if we wanted to move to it. Being smokers, we declined. She then offered us a free dinner and drinks at the French Quarter Bar located in The Ritz Carlton next door. WOW! All our complaints were remedied, but we should not have had them to begin with. I had also arranged for flowers to be sent to my wife as a surprise. The people who signed for the flowers had to be tracked down, as they lacked the common sense to bring them to the lobby. I guess they thought the flowers were sent as a gift to them with my wife's name on the box. Next is the $28.00 per day valet parking ripoff. If you don't plan on doing any driving during your stay, then rent the $18.00 per day parking at the Standard Parking garage across the street from the Iberville.

We read the reviews on TripAdvisor and decided on the Iberville Suites. However, we could not get 4 nights at the Iberville.

After much looking and reading TripAdvisor comments, we settled for the Dauphine Orleans because it was about the same price, and it looked, at the time, seems to be about the same as the Iberville. It was not! The Iberville Suites - Great location. We walked the French Quarter from the Iberville with no problems. Very nice room/bed, very comfortable. Staff very friendly. Breakfast is included with hot oatmeal, cook-your-self walfle, yogurt, juices, hot coffee/tea, rolls/toast fruits, etc. In room wired internet access is $13 from midnight to midnight (1 day). I prefer to have wireless access. Dauphine Orleans - Great location. Just down the street from the Iberville. Very friendly staff. Breakfast is included (same variety as the Iberville). Afternoon tea and sweet at the lounge from 3PM - 5PM. There is a small pool, but the water was too cold. The air vent in the room we stayed in blows the air directly at the head of the bed. So we had to just turn it off and open the window when sleeping. The bed, the sheets and blanket were of a Motel 6 class. It does not have in-room internet access. But does have free wireless internet access from the office, lounge and pool area. Since the cost was about the same between the Iberville Suites and Dauphine Orleans, I would expect that they are comparable. But they are not. I would definitely stay at the Iberville Suites again. I would caution those who may be thinking staying right on, or next to Bourbon street. The street gets very noisy from the evening into the night with lould music from bars and stores and people!

We also waited an inordinate amount of time for service when the toilet stopped up. Of course, it was Mardi Gras - but still for $200 a night, they can hire people to clean. And, the hotel was well staffed to boot. Only other thing to comment on was the strange staff. The bellman and doorman are fantastic. The people who work at the breakfast were also very nice.

Chose this accommodation on the basis of reviews from this site, however despite the glowing reviews I have read about them I feel I have to say how disappointing our stay there was. They served completary breakfast -- It was decent but what was on offer daily was the same type of food--same type of muffins, bagels, fruit and cereal in cartons!!. There was no variation at all. What was very was annoying about was all their serving plates and cups and cutlery were all plastic!!! So much for conserving the world's resources!!!I expected better as this as the hotel is managed by the Ritz they should have a t least ceramic if not porcelain serving dishes and decent cutlery. If this was a cost saving measure for the hotel I am afraid that it goes down really badly. The housekeeping service was very slow. We expected our rooms to have been cleaned by at least mid afternoon , but on the second day it took me four phone calls throughout the day and by the time they were able to clean the room and make up the bed & change it was 8PM!! Reception staff were polite but not very friendly. Our room was on the 7th floor and right outside our window as wa workman's lift and every morning at 8 pm the noise generated by this lift woke me up --so much for a lie-in!! The only advantage of Iberville Suites is the extra room one gets with the accommodation provided.", "Date": "April 26, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Deal.

Walking around in the French Quarter/Jackson Square (we did Ripleys Believe it or Not!) was exciting but we felt grubby after being on the streets all day and coming home to the Iberville was the perfect complement to the long days! Our room was always stocked with special Bath & Body Works bath supplies each day and we even had a cordless phone in room! Everything was meticulously clean/fresh! Like the other reviews, I agree about it being quiet! We didn't even hear other guests!!! The resistance pool and whirlpool was a great escape from the bustling city and fresh fruit was even offered in the excercise room!!! The full breakfast was eggs/bacon each day and I usually took it up to the room as I am the early riser! The rooms have mini fridges, so extras could be stored.

The hotel is located in the heart of the French Quarter and liteally minutes from nearly everything in the Quarter. However, the best part of the Iberville Suites was the staff. They were warm and friendly and always helpful. My wife celebrated her birthday at the hotel and the staff had just as much fun helping me plan my birthday surprise as I did! It was so nice to say thank you to the staff and hear \"my pleasure\" as a response. My hat is off to the staff at the Iberville Suites.
