Cons: the quality of Chez Chine has really declined; the dim sum was once well worth its high price but is now a Chinatown average; the breakfast buffet choices are fewer and blander--no more omelet station, lukewarm congee; we were also charged for cots--I'm not sure if that's industry standard but other chains never charged me.

Pros: - Location is great, super close to Old Montreal & Metro - Stay is only a good deal if you can get a rate of $75 or less. If I paid anymore than that, I would not think the stay was worth the money - They didn't have any non-smoking King rooms at the time of check-in, but gave us a non-smoking Queen room (#533), the room was extra spacious because it is a corner room. - We didn't have any problems with room carpet as stated by another reviewer. Everything in the room was clean and basic. Cons: - Hotel is definitely not a 3.5 stars as stated by Hotwire. Hotel is 3-stars. - Hotel is on top of Chinese plaza, when we got out of the elevator on the 5th floor, it smelled like Chinese food, and then it smelled like horrible garbage as soon as you turn. Hotel should really do something, at least put in some air freshener in the hallway (no smell in room). - Flat screen TV is nice, but they disabled movie playing capabilities from external devices, so we couldn't plug in a usb key to play a movie. Ended up watching via laptop. - Parking is $23/day, which is kind of high. But in comparison to nearby parking lots, the rate is fair (ie. $15/for 12 hours, $22/day, etc). - We had trouble finding the entrance to the parking garage on the first day!! Front desk did not pick up when we called, ended up having to go up to reception to ask. The entrance is on St. Urbain, which is a one-way street. - Washroom was really dark and fan extremely loud.

The hotel looks very old, the rooms, the lobby, the exterior, everything looks outdated and I felt like I went back to the 80s. The room was very old looking and outdated, it had a \"old\" smell, we didn't want to touch anything without sanitizing them. The lobby was dark and they should have more lights to give people a welcoming feeling, and at least just so people can find their way. My experience was this: I was hoping to give my tour guide a call because I left something on the tour coach bus. I saw a house phone in the lobby so I picked it up, and there was no answer. So I went to the front desk and waited (we were the only two people in the whole lobby). I saw a couple of people in the back office but I was polite enough to wait. Then, 2 staffs and 1 night manager came out from the back office, only 1 greeted me but not the others because they were chatting. The only one who greeted me (I meant he just said Hello with no smile) asked me to pick up the house phone beside the front desk instead of the first one I had, which was fine to me. I picked up the house phone, then this guy was working on something, then turned around and joined the conversation of the other two men, then transferred my call, but that was after like 5 rings! Thumbs up to this kind of service. I do want to comment on two positives though: We liked the complimentary shampoo/conditioner/lotion because they were Bath & Body Works, but as an IHG employee I think that is not what it's suppose to be according to standard. The location was absolutely great because it is so close to the Old Montreal and Notre-Dame Basilica.

It is across the street from the Place d' Armes subway station as well as a block away from bus # 747, which takes you directly to the airport. No need for a cab. Behind the hotel are wonderful chinese restaurants with some open until 3am for anyone that is in need of late night eats. There are also pastry shops on that same street as well. I believe parking is about 23 dollars a day, so parking can be a pricey proposition for anyone here.

I was traveling with another lady. I found that really unacceptable with the advanced reservation and a credit card guarantee. The hotel offered a rollaway bed to be put in the room, but that was not the point. I even called Monday prior to arriving on Friday to confirm my 2 queed bed room and was told, yes they had my reservation.

Not really an accurate rating. We were booked into a smoking room (823) and although the room didn't smell that badly, the smell in the hallways actually prevented a good night sleep for me, but I am allergic and extremely sensitive to the smell. The gentleman who checked us in our first evening was not very accomodating when we asked if we could please have a non smoking room. He was rather abrupt and simply said they were completely booked the entire weekend and could not switch the room. Early the next morning I approached the young woman at the front desk as though I had walked in off the street and asked if a room was available. She quickly said yes and then I said that I wanted to switch from our current room to a non smoking one. It didn't happen immediately, but eventually she was able to fill my request. At first she wanted to charge me (more than 2x the rate I had paid through Priceline) and I said I didn't want to pay more, I just simply wanted a non smoking room. Our first room on the 8th floor only had 1 double bed and was very dismal with ceiling stains and tired decor (the \"priceline room\" I imagine) and I got the distinct impression that they did not want to give us a better room. The room we did then get assigned to was on the 3rd floor and was already cleaned and ready to occupy at 8 in the morning, leading me to believe that it had been empty all night. I am annoyed that the first front desk staff person was so unhelpful that first night. It's not as though an \"upgrade\" to meet our request was costing him personally and since the room was obviously empty, why would the hotel be so stingy about making us happy customers. I have had the pleasure of staying at a Marriott in Toronto through Priceline and we were upgraded to probably the best room in the hotel when we had not even requested a change. They simply knew good customer service and I will now sing the praises of the Marriott on Bloor in Yorkville in Toronto for taking the extra step to ensuring a great stay. Obviously the Holiday Inn does not follow this practice and so I was disappointed. In the end however, Josephine at the front desk, did accommodate us and I was very grateful and the room we had on the 3rd floor was bright, very clean, spacious (2 queen size beds) and non-smoking. Pierre is a wonderful conceriege who obviously loves helping people discover Montreal. It was pretty noisy each night we stayed but I bring ear plugs and can drown out some of the noise. Why people come in at 3 or 4am and find it necessary to laugh loudly and slam doors, I don't know. I assume they have been drinking and don't have a clue about respect. For the money we paid, we were pleased but in the end I think I will book 4star and above hotels and pay the extra.

The fridge was not there on check-in. On calling the front desk to inquire, we were told that we would have to take a room with only one bed if we wanted a fridge. That was not possible for 4 people. The downtown location is terrible if you don't like noise! We heard sirens, traffic, and noise all night. In the early morning, the noise from outside was terrible, even on the weekend. Starting at 7 am, all we could hear was slamming hotel room doors that sounded like sonic booms each time. Bring along your own coat hangers if you want to hang anything in the closet. There were only five hangers for 4 people. We were told that our room gave us Executive Lounge privileges, where we could get coffee, etc. at any time of day. Turns our our room key cards wouldn't even open the lounge doors as they were supposed to. If I have to pay over $150 per night for a room, I at least want to have drapes on the windows!

The first thing that struck me about the hotel was the cleanliness, it is spotless. The room we had was huge and you can just sink into the beds as they are so comfy :-) On our first day I spoke to Pierre, the hotel's concierge, who again was a star and a great asset to the hotel, he gave us some first class recommendations on how to explore the city to get the most out of it and pointed us in the direction of ' Eggspectations' on St-Jacques West, which is literally a 5min walk from the hotel and serves a variety of reasonably priced breakfasts which will guarantee to set you up for the day - Pierre, thank-you so much! The location of the hotel cannot be beaten, its right on the edge of Chinatown, within a 5 minute walk to the cobbled streets of old Montreal and a 10-15 min walk to the underground city in the downtown area. We had tickets for a couple of shows at the Bell Centre and again, the arena was literally a 10-15 walk from the hotel. If I had any 'negative' comments to make about our room it would be that the bathroom was very dark (no window and very low lighting) and there was no safe in the room to keep passports, money etc, however there are complimentary safety security boxes available behind the reception desk. Montreal is a very safe and clean city, however there is a homelessness element to be seen in the park accross the road from the hotel, this did not infringe on our enjoyment or safety in any way. The concierge is at the main entrance to the hotel during the day and there is room card access to open the main doors at night, this area was always very well lit. The main hotel reception is on the second floor and all lifts automatically stop here no matter which floor you choose.

There is a metro station directly across the street and access to other parts of the downtown area are easily accessed by the metro or by walking.

Below is a small Asian mall with more herbal-type stores, chinese collectibles, etc. Reception is on the 2nd floor as is the on-site restaurant called \"Chez Chine\", obviously the main cuisine is Chinese.

I called the corporate sales manager multiple times and asked to be put on file so that I could fast-track the check -in process...was assured that things would be taken care of, but it never was. Went as far as having the company's corporate travel person advocate on my behalf, but again, nothing ever done. I could [--] all day, but these were the 2 deal breakers: a) An acquaintance of mine - who happened to be the GM of corporate travel at AMEX at the time - *refused* to come in my room because the disgusting smell of it made him nauseous. b) I broke my ankle slipping on the ice outside in winter. When I went to the front desk, the night *manager* was the only person present. I asked him to call a cab to the hospital because I was a guest at the hotel and \"I think I broke my ankle.\" His response was, \"I'm busy. I'll get someone for you.\" At that point, I got upset, pointed out again that I was a hotel guest, I was injured and needed his attention. Without looking up - or at me - he again stated (more forcefully), \"I'm BUSY! Someone will be with you shortly.\" I should note that at this point it was about 11:00 in the evening and the only people in the lobby were him and I. I ended up hopping on 1 leg to my room, getting my ID, hopping back down to the sidewalk, grabbing my own taxi and going to the hospital - where they confirmed that I had indeed broken my ankle.

Everything else worked but as previous reviewers have noted it is dated. However, the one thing travellers should be aware of with regard this hotel is that reception is on the second floor and you can access all the other floors directly from the lift / elevator without going through reception. I didn't realise this this until I retuned late one night 01:00 am. This is a serious security lapse for any hotel . I'm sure they will give some excuse about CCTV coverage but that will do you very little good if you are followed in off the street and mugged in your own corridor ( very badly lit so CCTV would be useless anyway) or even your room by a stranger. Therefore if you are female travelling alone do not stay in this hotel the risk is too great. Otherwise be very careful when you answer your door to room service or cleaning staff. Also I wouldn't leave anything valuable in your room at all. Plus Montreal police are not known for their effeciency in dealing with tourists who don't speak 17th century french which is effectively what they speak in Quebec. I've worked there with an ex Parisian police officer and even he had a hard job figuring out what people were saying and you will find many people ( even those 16-25 ) cannot speak English at all!

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not bad. In fact, it has some good qualities. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STRANGE. First of all, the architecture: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a combination of modern socialist block and Chinese palace; overall, one of the ugliest hotels I've ever seen. The outside yellowish brick is worn from the Canadian winter, yet the Chinese facades on top are colorful. The lobby is pure kitsch \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a pagoda and pond with goldfish surround the (pretty good) bar and (often closed, Chinese) restaurant. Carpet at the entrance and into the lobby is gritty and worn. The lobby is on the -second- floor, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be put off by the convenient (yet somewhat odd) collection of merchants on the entrance level: a convenient mini-grocery/souvenir shop, and a host of shops devoted to the Chinese community (the main avenue of which seems to be on the street directly behind the hotel). Just head for the elevators by the (-really- kitschy Chinese \"waterfall\"). The rooms: standard Holiday Inn, if a bit worn (especially carpets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but I noticed in my walk through that the lower floors seemed to have newer carpet - - you might ask). Large and serviceable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ours had a nice mini-fridge, and nice view looking right at downtown Montreal. Bathroom was large and clean, with nice toiletries and a very good shower. Heat worked well, despite the bitter cold. Housekeeping was particularly good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a request for an extra blanket rendered a very nice, new duvet \u00e2\u20ac\u201cand- an extra blanket. Good bed and pillows. Staff was really good - - knowledgeable and instantly responsive. I requested a room on a high floor with a view, and got it without hesitation. Concierge knew the city very well. Location is really good - - very close to the old city, and directly across the street from a metro stop which is part of the famed Montreal \u00e2\u20ac\u0153underground.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There is a 7/11-type store and a Tim Horton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, which has great, cheap food (especially breakfast), about 3 minutes away - - just go in the door next to the Metro. We got a really good price, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to complain about anything.

The street level of the hotel has a very small store, stocking assorted sundries, souveniers, drinks and snacks. Our room was large and serviceable, about what you'd expect in a Holiday Inn. Bathroom was quite large. Functioning minifridge, desk, and upholstered chair. AC/Heat was pretty loud, but functioned well. TV included both USA and Canadian channels. Our view was of the (inaccessible) rooftop pagoda, which is supposedly a replica of a former Emperor of China. We dropped off our bags, and ventured out to Vieux Montreal, about three blocks away. Tip: Cross the street (towards the Metro station), as the streets are one way, and can be tricky to avoid traffic. Mornings were quiet. A few newspapers were provided by the elevator bays. Only six or seven, though, so snag one early if you want one! Proximity to attractions is nice. Hotel is located just on the edge of Chinatown, which provided a nice walk through. We used the Metro often, and loved how easy it was to get everywhere. Another tip: Tim Horton's restaurant is located in the Metro station. Very inexpensive (under $5 each), and filling. We made a habit of stopping by the hotel bar every night on the way in from our excursions. The bartender was cordial, if not overly friendly, but provided light snacks, metro maps and helpful city navigation. Late check out was asked for, and granted. Although, many people must have asked for late check out, as when we came downstairs at 3, the front desk was manned by one person, and swarmed. However, many apologies were forthcoming, and they offerd to hold our bags for us for a few hours while we took a final walk around Vieux Montreal. We accepted, and our trip ended on a lovely note.

I wasn't quite expecting that...but it was relatively efficient because we arrived at the beginning of rush hour. But don't expect that free shuttle off hours. We ended up taking a cab ($8 CAD) to the bus station , and again the airport shuttle on the return to the airport. Room was large. It's a nice big hotel on a corner lot. I asked for a view and got an exterior 7th floor nice view facing west and looking downtown. Courtyard view might be quiet, but it would be boring. Nice large modern TV (not typical for budget hotels in Canada). 2 comfortable queen beds. 2 desks/tables/spaces to work/eat. Large bathroom counterspace could easily handle two people primping at the same time. Nice. Free Wireless connection was a big line item for us. We both have laptops, and use them. Wireless was non functional when we arrived and I was perturbed. Front desk had no idea that the whole hotel was down. I had to call technical help myself, and almost had to threaten to leave if I couldn't access highspeed Internet. Hotel sincerely apologized and told me the situation would be fixed in 45 minutes. It was!! They get extra points for that. Hotel is right on the Metro stop. 2 stops to the Berri station. Convenient. Travel time to Le Village was less than 20 minutes using the subway. Not bad. Purchase a one-day subway pass. $9CAD. Only Negative: Food/Restaurants! You have to like Chinese food as that is the only cuisine that is within a quick walk. After 10pm, good luck finding quick restaurants that are open in that neighborhood. If you're ready for a real good sit down meal, Chinatown offers tons of choices. But if you want something on the level of a quick munchie, good luck. Hotel Room service food was good, fast, (reasonably overpriced) and hearty. Old Montreal is a 10 minute walk and has a lot of good touristy restaurants. I did not try the pool or the weight room. Ground floor lobby services seemed tranquil and bit subdued. But that's not a complaint. Staff was professional, friendly and helpful. Housekeeping was extremely patient in letting us vacate our room so they could clean.

But this is the only pearl -- the rest is pretty ordinary and I don't think I will stay there again.", "Date": "March 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waterloo, Canada", "Title": "\u201cQuite Disappointing\u201d", "Author": "Celticgrl", "ReviewID": "UR4130302", "Content": "Stayed at the Holiday Inn for 2 nights in November 2005. Good location if attending a tradeshow or if you want to visit Chinatown. Hotel itself is quite disappointing. Although it has a nice lobby/restaurant area, the rooms are very old and dingy looking. The indoor pool was small and is certainly not cleaned on a regular basis. Overall service was average, nothing spectacular.
