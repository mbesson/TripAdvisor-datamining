From the moment I walked in the front doors of the hotel, I was immediately impressed. The hotel far exceeded my expectations from cleanliness to outstanding service. My family and I have stayed at many Holiday Inns but none as extraordinary as this one. The modern decor, gorgeous hand blown light fixtures, contemporary vanities and fabulous, comfortable furniture reminded me of a five star hotel. The designer of this hotel took every step to make guests comfortable and feel at home, even adding reading lights at each bedside and at the over sized chairs in the room. This was a special touch. The indoor pool was magnificent and there was a wonderful work out room, which we used often. Not only was I impressed with the decor, but I was equally impressed with the great service and Southern hospitality that I experienced during my two week stay. The Holiday Inn management took what would have been a stressful time in my life and turned it in to a much needed relaxing vacation. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!!!!!!", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Mill, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cSetting the Standard\u201d", "Author": "Richard B", "ReviewID": "UR126203325", "Content": "This hotel was easily the coolest, most modern and best Priority Club property out there.

I visit Dallas sporadically but I guess enough that just about everyone that has worked the front desk knows me by name. I had just made platinum status about a week before my last visit there and it was already updated on their computers. I was recognized as a platinum member and was given a complimentary upgrade to a suite! Cool! Funny thing, I visited the Holiday Inn in Buena Park California the very next week. No recognition of being platinum, no upgrade, on my check in document, they still had my PC as Gold. When I asked if that could be changed, I was told in a somewhat rude fashion, \" You have to change that online.\" When I was walking away, the person rudely gave me a complimentary bag of a bottle of water and a granola bar. Thanks. On my profile, it states King bed. So did my reservation. When I got to the room, it was a double. That's it! Won't be staying there any longer. Too bad for them. I am a loyal customer and was staying one week per month at that hotel for close to a year! I did talk to the manager and received an upgrade but too late. I got off track there.

I am pretty familiar with the area, but could not remember seeing this hotel. When I arrived, I realized why. As of 2/22/10 the Holiday Inn Express (Galleria) has only been open about 3 weeks! It is a brand new hotel with an very modern decor theme throughout. It's by far the nicest Holiday Inn Express I've stayed at so far. The rooms are relatively large with a roomy work area next to the beds. The room has a flat panel TV, but as of my visit the cable was not yet set up properly so it was a bit difficult to find channels. The bathroom is very contemporary and is clearly trying to be very nice, but the sink is very high and this could be a problem for families with smaller children. The room was very clean, the beds were comfortable, and the breakfast was surprisingly good. It also has a very nice, but small, fitness center and a pool with LED colored fountains flowing into it, which are a nice touch. There is also a decent amount of meeting space on the first floor. The staff was friendly and service was above average for a hotel in this price category. The only minor concerns I had with the hotel were access- you don't see the sign until you're pretty much right next to the hotel so keep an eye out for it and stay in the right lane on the frontage road, and little things that are likely due to the hotels recent opening. The TV is not yet configured properly, their waterfalls in the lobby were shut down because they needed to reseal them it appeared, and one of the LED booklight fixtures in my room didn't work. I think the kinks will probably get worked out of the hotel shortly though, and certainly don't constitute a reason not to stay there. It is extremely close to the Valley View Shopping Center and the Galleria. It is not quite walking distance, but Valley View is very close on the same frontage road as the hotel and the Galleria is just up past that. A great location for access and shopping/dining.", "Date": "February 22, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites Dallas (Galleria Area)", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d1493264-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Express_Hotel_Suites_Dallas_Galleria_Area-Dallas_Texas.html", "Price": "$90 - $141*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">6055 LBJ Freeway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dallas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">TX</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">75240</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1493264", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/87/f3/87f32cf3ae489f3416756a81b10e5a2b8large.jpg"}}
