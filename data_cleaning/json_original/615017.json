The walking directions from the train station were simple and we found the hotel easily - even after traveling for 24 hours to get there. On our arrival, the owner, Mary, was very helpful and showed us to our room, gave us a map and routed out an afternoon city walking tour. It was perfect and we had a wonderful first afternoon. The next morning, we had accidentally set our clocks wrong (pm instead of am) and overslept and missed our morning tour. Mary called the tour company for us and got them to let us take the tour the next day. She was an immense help to us throughout our stay. Helping us find grocery stores, restaurants, making reservations for us, telling us which bus to take. You couldn't ask for a better hostess. Be prepared - the rooms are small, as were all the hotel roooms we stayed in on our 3 1/2 week Italy trip. Rooms in Italy are nothing like you find in the US, but it is all part of the charm and experience of being in a foreign country, right? The location is very good. Plenty of things are close, including a church around he corner that we just happened to wander into our first day - it turned out to be built by Michelangelo from the old Roman baths and had the most enormous pipe organ i have ever seen! It's close to the Roma Termini (main train station) where you can get the subway to the coloseum and other areas). And the buses all stop just around the corner from the hotel. Mary helped us become experts at public transportation. Heed all the warnings about pickpockets. I did have someone try to take things from my purse while we were on the subway packed in like sardines! And I'm fairly certain it was a woman with a baby in a baby carriage. She used the baby as a distraction while she reached into your bag. When I got off the subway train, all the zippers on my purse were open. Luckily she didn't find anything of value to take as I had my money and credit cards in my pocket. Mary was such a wonderful hostess and a huge help to us through our whole stay so I would stay there again if we get back to Rome.

If you are looking for a cosy, friendly family-run small hotel then read on... Found this hotel on TripAdvisor and very glad we did. We were visiting Rome for our 20th wedding anniversary and wanted the perfect trip, Mary and Carlos helped make that possible. The warmth and friendliness is evident from booking, continued on arrival right until the moment of departure. When we checked in Mary gave us two maps and spent probably 20 minutes or so explaining routes and places of interest. I had already drafted an itinerary for our trip but the hints from Mary were invaluable (especially the route to take to the Spanish Steps so you end up at the top and can walk down, rather than the other way round!). Our room was at the front of the hotel overlooking the road which was not a problem in the slightest due to the incredibly effective shutters and windows. When going to bed the room was in total darkness and hardly a noise could be heard. The hotel was full but at no time did we hear other guests moving around in their rooms. While I agree with an earlier review that the TV was small I cannot comment on the picture quality or the channels available as we did not use it at all. Very efficient fridge in the room and small safe which was large enough for cash and passports etc. I had no qualms about leaving my Ipad and camera in the room. There are only 7 rooms in total and had total trust in Mary and Carlos. The hotel provides free wi-fi and you will get the code at check-in. Mary gave me two codes for the two wi-fi services available to ensure I got the best signal. The signal was immediately picked up and was consistently strong throughout our visit. The room (Pantheon Room) was adequate in size, with a comfortable double bed and a small table and two chairs. The bathroom was a good size with good shower pressure. On leaving the hotel the room key is given in at reception (you take the safe key with you) and you have to ring the buzzer to get back to the hotel. This enhanced the hotel security and if we knew we were going to be back especially late we just let Mary and Carlos know. At no time in Rome did we ever feel unsafe walking around, even returning to the hotel at midnight. We pre-booked a car to and from the airport but Termini station is under 10 minutes walk away. Everything was within easy walking distance from the hotel. The only time we used public transport was to get to the Vatican as we had a tour booked at a set time. The nearby metro took 15 minutes to get there. There is a good supermarket near to the hotel and a street market in the next street. There are many restaurants in the area or further afield. If you have not visited Rome before and want to judge distances, it took us 45 minutes to walk from Castel Sant'Angelo back to the hotel, so it would have been about an hour direct walk to the Vatican.

Using their advice we were able to explore both the hidden and tourist parts of Rome, and found some lovely Italian restaurants to have our long afternoon lunches and rest our feet before starting the second half of the day. Rome is best explored on foot, so while in Rome, do what the Romans do - start off early in the morning when the queues to the attractions are the shortest (organised guided tours usually start around 9:30 am), take a leisurely two hour break between 1-3 when the sun is at its hottest, and start the afternoon again at 3 - in Rome many of the tourist attractions and shops stay open till 8 pm. Be prepared to walk, the hop-on/hop-off bus barely touches the most beautiful sights in Rome, which are only accessible by foot. The hotel is very conveniently located close to the Terminii station (Terravision buses run regularly to Ciampino airport for four euros each way), and is close to bus route 492, which takes you all the way to Piazza Navona and beyond. We would suggest spending your first morning in Rome exploring the area around the hotel on foot, there are a lot of hidden gems around, and it gives you an idea of which bus routes and metro stations are easily accessible. Tickets for the metro or bus can be bought from just opposite the hotel, or at any newstand for one euro for a single ticket, valid for 75 min. Rooms very comfortable and clean, with a tv (the only english channel is bbc news), a small fridge/freezer, and a safe, and air-conditioning which can be adjusted according to your needs. Beds were good, not the most comfortable pillows, but after a day walking around Rome, we were asleep in under 10 mins! The rooms are shuttered and double-glazed, and in spite of being in a room facing the front road, we hardly heard a sound in the room once the windows were shut. Breakfast is not included in the price, but every morning we were provided with a generous croissant and juice, which quiet easily saw us all the way to lunch. A tip for those of you planning to visit the Vatican museum and St. Peters Basilica - we divided the trip into two mornings, as there is a lot to explore. We first visited the Vatican musuems - by booking our entry tickets online, we walked straight in, beating the long queue. On Mary's advice we used the Cipro metro station to access the vatican museum - its a 10 min walk (use Google maps to located outer wall of the Vatican from Cipro, then follow the wall around till you see a long queue ahead). When you come to the Sistine chapel,there is a small corridor then lets you directly access St. Peters, where it is also possible to book a guided tour. The next morning, we spent time exploring the basilica before the tour groups started (this time using the Ottavino metro station - entry to basicilia is free), climbing the cupola & exploring the tombs. We spent both afternoons visiting the lovely fountains of Rome, splitting our day this way allowed to really appreciate the fine art in the Vatican, of which there is a lot to take in. Overall, a very lovely experience, and I would give this hotel an additional star for the charming hospitatlity of the hosts.", "Date": "October 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Canada", "Title": "\u201cTerrific budget hotel with caring and helpful staff.\u201d", "Author": "DylanBob", "ReviewID": "UR80384175", "Content": "We spent five days in Rome to see all of the many historical sites and art museums we could fit in.

It is a touristy area but more for Italian tourists. We went there twice in the evening. There were vendors and booths along the Tiber River and lots of little restaurants.

I had concerns because I read in a review for another hotel that the area near Termini was seedy, but that must be on a different side of the station from where Welrome is. I found the area around Welrome to be fine. The reason I don't give a higher score for location is because it's about a 20-minute walk to any of the major sites in Rome. Unfortunately the city's 2 metro lines won't get you everywhere; for example, the Pantheon is a 15-minute walk from the nearest station. I was traveling with my wife and her mother, and I think they would have preferred to stay somewhere that would allow us to more easily access the major sites on foot. We ended up taking taxis back to Welrome most of the time. We stayed in the Navona room, which was small but acceptable, typical for Europe. The shower, however, was tiny. I had a difficult time moving inside of it and I'm only 5'10\", 160 lbs. Wifi is included in the rate, but the signal strength was weak in our room. The lobby had a much stronger signal. Welrome does not claim to serve breakfast, but tea and instant coffee is provided in the room, and croissants and juice are served each morning. That kept us going until lunch each day. The room had a mini-fridge which was occasionally filled with water and juice throughout our 4-night stay. Sleep quality was pretty good. The windows have interior doors that close over them from the inside, which allowed us to make the room very dark even when the sun was out. There is a restaurant below the hotel that stayed noisy until about 11pm, so be aware of that if you are hoping to get to sleep early. Otherwise the hotel was pretty quiet. The hotel was generally clean, but I gave an average rating on cleanliness because the lobby had a bad odor which permeated up the the hall outside of the rooms. I'm not sure what it was, but it seemed to be there at all times of day, and sometimes made it unbearable to be in the lobby. The staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. They had great recommendations for how to get to the important sites. Thanks to their suggestions, we ended up visiting the Galleria Borghese without a reservation. They were (sometimes overly) eager to make sure that we made the most out of our time in Rome. I recommend Welrome for the value, although it may be worth looking into staying a little closer to the main sites if that's possible at a rate comparable to what Welrome charges. Hopefully the problem with the odor will be addressed as well.", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cLoved Rome ane the Welrome\u201d", "Author": "SuzMelbourne", "ReviewID": "UR69851555", "Content": "First time for us visiting Rome so we were looking forward to staying at the Welrome.

However as we have had such a positive experience I have been moved to write my first review. As background I stay in hotels a lot with work, in fact 4 days before my trip I was at the Fairmont in St Andrews comfortably ensconced in a suite so I am use to both ends of the hotel spectrum (the ones work pays for and the ones I spend my own cash on). I should also add that as I work with people all day when I am on holiday I don\u2019t like to mix, in fact the only thing I was not looking forward to at the Welrome was the briefings from Mary and Carlos that so many of the reviewers have talked about. Which is ironic as it was these sessions of advice that made our break great instead of good. Yes, it is true they do spend time talking you through the area and Rome and giving advice on where to go and what to see, Carlos especially will point out little hidden gems once you tell him where you\u2019re going. But to all those who don\u2019t want to listen to this you have and option, simply do as I was going to do and excuse yourself. However I would strongly advise you not to, their knowledge, passion and advice really makes Rome come alive. Now down to the hotel itself. The hotel is a little way from the centre of Rome, if by centre you meant the Roman Forum but there is plenty of historical and artistic merit on your door step practically. The area is nowhere near as bad as I expected, it is a little run down but then so is most of Rome outside of the big tourist venues, it is safe, clean and populated with several restaurants and shops. It is also perfect for the station. The hotel itself is basic, but I would have put it at 3 rather than 2 stars, it is small but clean and the beds and noise proofing were great, I slept better than I do on our fancy memory foam mattress at home. The juice and croissants in the morning are a nice touch and while the reception area might not be to my taste it give the place character.

We took the train from the airport costing 30Euros for the 2 of us, the trains was very busy so we had to stand for the 30 minute journey. For our return we took a taxi costing 55euros. Location wise, the hotel was fairly central, and a walk to the Colesseum, Roman Forum, Pantheon was approx 20-25 mns. My hubby and I visited Rome for our wedding aniversary and Mary arrived with a small bottle of champagne after we had checked in and the following day (our anniversary) we returned from our sight-seeing to find sugar almond flowers by our bed. Mary and Carlos couldnt do enough to recommend places to visit and gave us routes to follow on free maps they kindly provided. On a wet morning Mary even lent me her umbrella so we wouldnt get wet. We had Pantheon room which had double bed and ensuite bathroom. The room wasnt large but was perfectly adequate for our needs. The bed was made up daily and towels also changed daily. Coffee and tea is provided in the room. Our room faced the street but after closing the shutters and the double glazed windows the street noise was minimal. Breakfast is not included but every morning we were left croissant and juice in a basket outside our room. The hotel has only 7 rooms and we didnt have any noise from our neighbours. The hotel also offered free wifi which was great for keeping in touch with our family. We ate out every night and would definately recommend the Restaurant Wanted which is situated on Via Leonina close to the Colosseum, they do fab pizzas and soups and is reasonably priced for Rome.

Carlo and Mary were always on hand to offer advice on great restaurants and places to see. The moment we arrived, Mary produced one of her famous maps and immediately started to point out the main places of interest. It's fair to say that the 20 minutes spent going over the map with her helped us to hit the ground running. We had also pre booked to see that Vatican museum and Carlo insisted on speaking with us before we went. He spent an hour giving us invaluable tips on what we should look out for. He is very passionate and knowledgeable about Roman history and art, so his advice made our visit that much better and saved us the expense (20 Euro per person) of using a guide. Mary recommended several restaurants and perhaps just as importantly advised against others. She based this advice on the feedback from previous guests. We took her advice and were very pleased. Prior to our trip I was concerned about the cost of eating out. I had travelled with my wife and two teenage daughters. As a result of reading some reviews on trip advisor, I expected to pay between 100 - 140 Euro for dinner. In fact, we paid an average of 70 Euro for all four of us and that included a couple of starters, 4 main courses (Pasta or Pizza) and deserts. We also had a bottle of wine, a beer and a couple of soft drinks with evening meals. Mary recommended the restaurants and we were never disappointed. I think it is important to point out that the hotel, although spotlessly clean, is basic. If you are looking for a hotel with a lounge/bar and restuarant then this is not for you. Our room accommodated the four of us but we had to share a small wardrobe. We had to use our suitcases to store our clothes - but this is a small price to pay for the incredible service.

Thank you Mary and Carlo for making our stay so enjoyable, it would not have been the same without your advice.", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfax, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hosts; Great Value in a Small Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Paul5795", "ReviewID": "UR58525043", "Content": "My wife and I traveled to Rome with our two children, both of whom were on spring break from University. We stayed at the Welrome hotel for seven nights, from March 6 until the 13th. We chose the Welrome in large part because of previous TripAdvisor reviews. The Welrome is actually more like a \u201cBed and Breakfast\u201d than like a typical hotel. The Welrome has only seven rooms, all located on the second floor (in the USA, that means one level up from the ground floor), and is owned and run by two excellent hosts: Mary and Carlo. And even though the Welrome is advertised as not having any \u201cbreakfast,\u201d Mary brought us a pastry and some juice each morning, which we enjoyed with the in-room instant coffee and tea. On our first day, we arrived rather late in the afternoon, about 5 PM, and took a cab to the hotel (40 Euros flat rate from the airport). When we arrived, Mary hauled out a tourist map and told us how to get to the local supermarket (two blocks away), recommended a place to eat (the Ristorante di Giovanni), and then diagrammed several walks we could take after dinner. After cleaning up, we went to the supermarket, and picked up wine, crackers, cheese, and salami at good prices, just like Mary said we would. Then we headed back out to dinner at Di Giovanni, about four blocks away. Just as advertised, it was very good -- and reasonably priced too. We ordered a litre of the house red wine, and a litre of the house white, each for only 6 Euros and each very good. The total bill, which included the wine, first, seconds, and dessert for four persons \u2013 all excellent -- was only 86 Euros. Again, very nice. Then we stumbled back to the hotel, where we were met by Carlo, who wanted to know what our plans were for our stay and then outlined another nice walking route for the next day (our first full day). In fact, throughout the remainder of our stay both Mary and Carlo were full of great ideas for what to see and do. They love their city of Rome, and it shows. My wife and I stayed in the San Pietro room, and our kids stayed in the Colosseo room. Each room had three single beds, with two pushed together to make a larger bed, and the bed mattresses were nice and firm. The rooms were both good size, I think, for European standards, measuring about 11 feet by 14 feet, not including a short entryway and a the bathroom. The room ceilings were very high, maybe also about 11 feet. The floors were red tile, and the walls were painted yellow. The rooms are nicely furnished, but the furnishings are older and relatively plain. The tables, beds, cabinets, TV, bedspreads, and curtains, heating and cooling controls, light fixtures, and even the light switches are all functional but dated. The TV, for example, is small, with only a 12 inch screen, and the cable has one English-language channel, BBC World. So if you are looking for a modern or luxurious hotel room with the latest in furnishings and amenities, this is not the place for you. But if you are looking for a clean, pleasant hotel in a good location with two super nice hosts, heh, this could be the place. And who goes to Rome to watch the TV??? The two rooms were fairly quiet. Although our room faced the street, there was little in the way of noise, as the hotel is on a narrow, one way, side street so there is very little traffic noise. We did hear some noise one night in which a large group of students staying at the hotel across the street were out and about. Our kids\u2019 room faced the back and they reported no noise from the courtyard. Although the nights were cold, the heating system worked well. The free wireless internet also worked fine. The wi fi signal worked in both rooms, and the speed and signal strength were adequate for what we needed (mostly checking email and looking up some things about Rome on the web). The bathroom was also fine. The shower was small, but there was plenty of hot water and good water pressure, even when the four of us were all getting ready at about the same time. The bathroom was clean, although there was a small amount of mildew around the bottom of the shower and up on the ceiling above the shower. My wife used the hairdryer (a wall mounted unit, again, somewhat dated) and had to play with it a bit to keep it working by continuously holding the hot air hose away from the wall. She did figure out how to do that. The Welrome location is a good one. Rome is made for walking, and just about everything was accessible from the Welrome by a short walk. For example, the Coliseum and the ancient area of Rome is a 25 minute walk to the southwest, the Presidential palace a 15 minute walk to the west, the Trevi fountain a 20 minute walk to the west, the Spanish steps a 25 minute walk to the northwest, and the Galleria Borghese a 15 minute walk due north. Other interesting sites are even closer, with, for example, the National Roman History museum just around the block from Welrome. In fact, the only \u201cmajor\u201d attraction that was too far away for walking was the Vatican, but that is easily accessible by metro (subway). The main train station (Termini) is a five minute walk away from the Welrome. The two Rome subway lines form a large \u201cX\u201d with the intersection of the \u201cX\u201d at Termini, so you can catch the subway to wherever it goes. Having read the lousy TripAdvisor reviews about the Archeobus and the 110 Tram, we bought tickets on the \u201cRoma Christiana,\u201d a different \u201chop-on hop-off bus\u201d (one day pass 16 Euro, three day pass 25 Euro). This particular bus stopped just three blocks from the Welrome, and worked fine for us when we wanted to get a general overview of the city and get over to see the Vatican. As for food, we had several picnics in our room to keep costs down. Aside from the Di Giovanni, we ate dinner in two other nearby restaurants: Babbos (just around the corner from the Welrome) and the Trattoria Pretoriana (about three blocks from the Welrome). All three restaurants were good. Babbos was slightly better than the other two in terms of the excellence of the food, but was also a little pricier mostly because their wine was more expensive. For me, Di Giovanni\u2019s was the best value in terms of balancing quality and cost. When I get around to it, I will post separate reviews on each restaurant. I should also mention La Famiglia Ristorante, a restaurant which is immediately adjacent to the Welrome. It looked very nice through the windows, and seemed to have lots of diners. But the restaurant has some pretty lousy reviews on TripAdvisor that imply that, as far as service goes, it favors the locals and doesn\u2019t really treat tourists well. In any event, Mary and Carlo did not specifically recommend the La Famiglia so we did not try it. Mary and Carlo keep the front door to the hotel locked at all times, and they keep control of the keys when you leave. That is fine, as one of them seemed to be readily accessible at whenever we wanted to come or go. Still it is probably good, if you can, to let them know exactly when you plan to return. Also, we noticed that on the hotel stairs the handrail does not begin at the top of the stairs but only after three or four steps down. Mary and Carlo really should think about adding a short handrail extension at the top of the stairs. To sum it up, we really enjoyed our stay in Rome and we highly recommend the Welrome Hotel, Mary, and Carlo!", "Date": "March 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel Experience in Europe\u201d", "Author": "rocketsfan007", "ReviewID": "UR57925273", "Content": "I am a student in London and have been traveling around the Continent as much as I can.

I did and Hasan said leave it with me and come back in 3 hours which I did and he had washed, dried and packed all our laundry.

We were shown our relation to close landmarks and sights, as well as provided with tips on how to save money and time on our stay. Basically anytime we headed out Carlo was there to provide some history, point out some highlights on our way to our destination. That's service. Rooms: Clean, comfortable, quiet. When in Rome... I don't plan on staying in, I do however expect a place to all that Welrome is. Bed was comfortable, not completely firm like most beds in Europe, especially for a side sleeper like me. Sheets were clean, furniture was basic. TV had cable, and atleast 1 channel, BBC in English. There was a place to hang my clothes as well as a safe to put things in, and a fridge to put food in. Bathroom was clean, and also basic. Location: Really close to Roma Termini, however, its on the less dodgy side or the tracks. Did not feel unsafe at anytime around where the hotel is located. Real close to the Metro so most sights are real close. Albeit maybe a bit farther off if you were to walk Rome, as I did. Amenities: Besides the room, and the concierge like Mary and Carlo, none. Carlo was friendly enough to help with the bags, Mary was kind enough to point out the supermarket around the corner where we stocked up on snacks and water. But I may point out that during our stay Mary and Carlo were uber nice to provide fresch croissants and juice boxes every morning our entire stay. Value: Can't be beat. Trust me, if I had an endless supply of dough, would I stay here? probably not, I'd probably be at a posh hotel near the spanish steps or city center. but I don't so I need to make sure my money takes me a long way, which it does here.

Great advice on visiting the Vatican, shopping, eating out 5) Great initiative by Mary and Carlos - we had an early flight and departure.

The front desk is like a small tourism / information / education centre - a valuable resource for a visitor new to the streets and ways of Rome. We were given excellent advice on all manner of things - right down to where to find the finest gelato we have ever tasted. Carlo prepared us for visits to various sights (especially Vatican Museum and Sistine Chapel) by bringing out art & architecture books from his collection, and pointing out special features to watch for on visits. Carlo would not only tell you where to find a certain attraction, but tell you about it, and put it into its cultural & historical context. It was always a great joy discussing where we were about to go, and on our return sharing impressions. Our adult son was with us for 2 days of our stay. On the morning he left at 5:30 to catch the train to the airport, Mary was watching out to ensure that he was not late, and gave him some fresh pastries to take and eat for his early start breakfast. Although just a small gesture, it was typical of the thoughtful hospitality shown to us, and (from the reviews) many other guests at their hotel. Now for the hotel itself. It is a comfortable and simple small hotel of 2-star rating. In general, the rooms in 2-star hotels we visited were quite a squeeze, so we were very pleased to find a room (the \"Spagna\" family 4 bed family room) of a generous size, with a roomy lobby where cases could be stored, and a good-sized bathroom. The shutters and glazed windows keep out unwanted noise - not that the street is particularly busy. The hotel is an easy 10 minute case-pull from the Termini Station, and is well located. In a few minutes you can walk to caffes, bars, restaurants, supermarket, laundromat and other facilities. All manner of important attractions are within half an hours walk of the hotel - just follow the clear directions on the maps Mary and Carlo will give you! The difference between this hotel and some other places we stayed in could not be more marked. Hotel Welrome - you deserve your No 1 Popularity Rating.

There is seriously a lifetime's worth of sights to see in Rome, so we really appreciated their recommendations of which sights/museums/churches are not to be missed, as well as their opinions on the few which are probably not worth the time. Without them we probably would have wasted a lot of time trying to figure out buses and walking routes etc, so we were really grateful that they were able to help us with this. They are two of the loveliest and most generous people you will meet in Italy (or anywhere else!). If you have a problem of any sort while you are in Rome, they will do everything they can to make sure it is fixed. We felt so well cared for. The hotel's location was ideal for us as we arrived by train. The station is close, and it's very easy to navigate to the hotel, even with massive suitcases like we had. Pretty much all the places we visited in Rome (everything except for the Trastevere district and the Vatican) we were able to walk to from the hotel. The hotel's bedrooms and ensuite bathrooms were extremely clean and comfortable. The room features include a safe, TV (italian only), and air conditioning, which was great. In a lot of hotels the air conditioning is centrally operated, but in welrome you can set the temperature that you want for your own room. We were there in winter and were never too cold in our room, and i imagine it would be well appreciated in summer too. Every room has a fridge and we found that we saved a lot of money by stocking up on food at the supermarket nearby. The hotel doesnt serve breakfast, but we went to the bar across the street called Li Rong Cafe, where you can have coffee and a crossaint at a table for 1.60 euro. I'd def recommend that place- it was a great tasting breakfast, and it was the cheapest price we came across on our entire trip. If you stay at welrome, its really worth going to the places recommended by mary and carlo. We went to a gelateria and a trattoria which they pointed out on the map for us and they were both great value, with amazing food. They were the sort of places we never would have found for ourselves, but we were so glad we went there. Mary and Carlo make Welrome such a unique hotel, and I would highly recommend it to all kinds of travellers. I think you would struggle to find a better place to stay in Rome!", "Date": "February 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cThe best hosts in Rome!\u201d", "Author": "Di_UK", "ReviewID": "UR24173715", "Content": "I meant to write this review ages ago....however, months on I still haven't forgotten the generosity and helpfulness of our hosts Maria and Carlo at Welrome.

Mary met them at the door, addressing them each by their names, got them settled, gave them directions and assisted them in their four days in the Eternal City.

My son was able to pick it up the next day. Mary and Carlo assisted them in obtaining cabs, finding eating establishments, groceries, etc. The room was clean, not fancy, but comfortable and the price was reasonable.

I looked around on the internet and contacted this hotel by email. Already in the replies from the emails, they were very friendly and gave quite some information already. I booked the trip and was eager to see if all the good reviews were right. We got a very nice welcome and immediately they gave good advice suggesting a first walk around in the city untill our room came free. All this advice was very nice, but not so needed in our case as I consider myself as a seasoned Rome traveler. Still they warned us for the tourists traps and gave some good advice. Some new restaurants I didn't know, some nice gelateria's, a nearby mall etc. Also if you have questions, they won't sleep untill they helped you. Most other hotels offer trips in cooperation with agencies eg a trip to Ostia. The people of this hotel just tell you not to take the trip and explain how to do the same but way cheaper and on your own. In general their objective is very noble: they want people to enjoy Rome and have a great time without paying too much. That isn't so hard as Roma is a marvellous place (I am not being very objective here). But when I say to people to go to Rome and give them a whole bunch of do's and don'ts I have the same objective. Rome is such an amazing place and there are so many great things to do/eat and drink, but only if you are a little smart. The people of this hotel will be the perfect help for people that aren't too familiar or confident with all this. In fact if someone would ask me tips about going to Rome, I'll send them to the Welrome as I am l sure they will return with as much love for Rome as I have now. But also for more seasoned travellers I can recommend it, as they will let you know things you don't know yet and never be afraid to ask them your specific needs or interests. More specifically about the hotel. There is no breakfast, but that is actually an advantage. Instead of a bad breakfast, you will need to go outside. They will recommend a good place and there you can get a great capuccino and brioche for just \u20ac1.70 and it is very close. So much more real and you get used to that great habit so easily. Just do as the Romans do. The rooms are clean and comfortable, not too big , but honestly if you spend too much time on them (except for the obligatory rest) you are missing all the fun of a great city. The hotel is very reachable from any airport, but somewhat out of the centre, but you can always use the metro to get in the centre, if you are tired of walking. My report has been quite long and I hope without too many language mistakes. But as a conclusion I want to repeat that I would recommend this hotel to anyone, but don't all go as I want to be able to go back someday too. But don't hesitate, this a great hotel and if you have never been in Rome, please go as you are missing something. All I want is to share my passion and I hope that as many people as possible will be abe to enjoy the amazing city that is Roma!

The Welrome Hotel was nice and clean. Mary & Carlo are wonderful hosts. They were so helpful and interested in what we were doing. The hotel is very near the Termini Station, the city bus and metro stops. This was great for getting around Rome. They don't serve breakfast but we felt this forced us to get out and explore the city.

Mary and Carlo really are the sweetest people. Every time we left the hotel they made sure we had a map marked with the best gelato spot, a beautiful statue, a great shoe store, or wherever we said we wanted to go. We stayed in the Pantheon room and found it to be very comfortable with a soft bed, wardrobe with safe, silent refrigerator, window with a street view, and plenty of hot water in the shower. Sure, the room and bathroom are small, but we didn't spend much time in the room and it was very clean. The walk to Termini was easy and I thought the neighborhood was fine. The restaurant next door to the hotel was fine as was the nearby coffee spot we discovered one morning. We stayed four nights and would have stayed more. It was hard to leave our \"uncle\" Carlo and \"aunt\" Mary.", "Date": "December 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat for a first timer to Rome\u201d", "Author": "mikeandmil", "ReviewID": "UR11132513", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Welrome Hotel earlier this year - for 6 nights (and 1 more when we flew out of Rome). The hotel is less than ten minutes walk from Termini station. The room was a very good size, with a fridge (for your own provisions as opposed to a mini bar) and a decent bathroom. It was also completely spotless. Mary and Carlo are priceless. Don't be scared by Mary's photo on the website. I don't think that I've ever met two more enthusiastic hoteliers. They man reception at all hours - whether you're coming back at 2am after dinner or taking a 5am taxi to the airport. Carlo in particular has excellent English and loves Rome. He is a Roman and couldn't be more proud of the place. He was a wealth of information on sites, sculptors, fountains, restaurants, ice cream flavours, laundromats, Italian coffee........He can talk for hours - but it's all good stuff. He must have marked 50 points of interest on our map and was very proud of us when we told him which of them we had managed to visit. There is no breakfast provided but there is a supermarket 5 minutes walk away and a cafe just over the road. It was our first visit to Rome and Carlo and Mary were able to ensure that we got the most out of our stay. I think that if we had a larger budget that we would probably not stay around Termini again. Not because it felt unsafe (it didn't) but more that it was a fair walk to most major tourist sites. The main siteseeing areas were probably 30 minutes walking (which in September was quite hot and sweaty going) - and more walking once you're there. I would however have no qualms about recommending the hotel and would certainly love to go back.", "Date": "November 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stirling Scotland", "Title": "\u201cgreat place\u201d", "Author": "holidaymakerstirling", "ReviewID": "UR10454272", "Content": "great location, room nice and clean, but the highlight of the hotel are the owners. could not fault them. hospitality excellent and the information provided about rome was great. would not hesitate to recommend this small hotel!!!!!!", "Date": "October 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Exeter, NH", "Title": "\u201cLove Rome and 4.5 Welrome\u201d", "Author": "nd2ski", "ReviewID": "UR10443262", "Content": "This is a nice hotel. We arrived at the Welrome weary and wary (due to all the cautions re big city travel) and were greeted by Rome's best ambassador, Mary. She tirelessly spent time acquainting us with her magnificent city. With our new information we enthusiastically set off for a twilight walk to The Spanish Steps and The Trevi Fountain-magical! Our room was comfortable and quiet. Wish there was a shelf in the bathroom, if I must criticize! Location is urban but not threatening. Daytime it's busy with people and traffic. Night I'd travel with a companion-just common sense stuff.
