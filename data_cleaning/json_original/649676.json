IF you want 5 stars conf or deluxe services, this is not the place for you, just go next door and pay 3 times more. The hotel offered enought for what we paid (65\u00e2\u201a\u00ac a night, incl breakfast with omeletes!) . Our room was not the biggest, but clean and confortable for our needs. We indeed spent more time on the wonderful terraces and walking around, so after all a real good choice. The hotel is in a quite location, in the middle of the old city, just a short stroll from the Bue Moschee, Aiga Sophia and the Cistern Basilic. What can you ask more for this money :-)) The night porter (James Bond), the receptionist (Tom Cruise) and the waiter in charge for breakfast were very helpful and always tryied to please our noisy small group of Italians. Definitely, we will go back to Istanbul soon, and definitely go back to Muhlsi Bey.

The location is great, in a quiet street in Sultanhamet, opposite to the Four Seasons, and near to the so called backpackerland. The area has a relaxed atmosphere and little traffic, so you don't need to worry about noise (except for that produced occasionally by the staff of the Four Seasons, for example vacuum cleaning the lobby in the middle of the night). You can hear the muezzin singing from a distance in the early morning - not a problem. The hotel is exactly between the Blue Mosque and Haghia Sofia, so you get great views of both, as well as of the Marmara Sea, from the top floor terrace, which is quite large and nice (but be prepared, the flowers are plastic). The breakfast is ok, served in a covered area of the terrace equipped with a full kitchen. The lobby is extremely small, but there is always someone there for you. The staff is helpful, they reply to emails quickly, assist you with your reservation, and can arrange airport pick up and drop off. The hotel used to be called AliBaba, as you can still notice from details as keyrings, and is a sister hotel of the Apricot. The rooms are clean, with wooden floors, kilims, comfortable beds, tv, good AC, private bathroom, and balcony. We had a small room with a small balcony overlooking the backyard, which was nice, and some days later we decided to upgrade to a bigger room with a view on Haghia Sofia, a little more expensive but still affordable.", "Date": "July 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Menlo Park, CA", "Title": "\u201cLovely, but soon to be more expensive\u201d", "Author": "redheadca", "ReviewID": "UR7697100", "Content": "We couldn't stay at our first choice, the Sebnem, which is right around the corner. Tahir at the Sebnem found us a room at the Ali Baba for 60euro...a reduction from their normal 80ero price. We were in room 9 on the top floor. It looks out at the beautiful Four Seasons Hotel and has its own small balcony. The room was a nice size with a wall full of windows. It had a mini-bar and TV. The bathroom was a nice size and had a shower/tub combination. The only issue we had was actually finding the Ali Baba. We had seen its sign as we left the Sebnem 2 weeks earlier, but when we returned, the sign was down and the first floor had been demolished. The rooms were all intact, however, they were just doing a renovation of the lobby. The Ali Baba is well located within a 5 minute walk of the Blue Bosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace and the Sutanahmet metro stop. Its also only a 10 minute walk from the Grand Bazaar. There are restaurants everywhere in the area...as well as carpet shops. The manager told us that he would be continuing renovations and will soon be raising the rates to 100euro. The whole area seems to be increasing rates and upgrading. I would definitely stay here again at the rate we paid, but I'd look at alternatives at the higher rates since I always travel on a tight budget.", "Date": "May 25, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Muhlis Bey", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d649676-Reviews-Muhlis_Bey-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$85 - $98*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Cankurtaran Mah 12</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34122</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "649676", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/be/b7/80/muhlis-bey-thumbnail.jpg"}}
