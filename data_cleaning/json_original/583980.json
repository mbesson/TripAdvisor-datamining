I knew the hotel may not be great but decided to give it a go.

Clean sheets and a okish comfy bed. Small flat screen tv (no remote) and en-suite which was a small bath type thing with a shower over (loose fitting but didn't cause too many problems). There was a kettle tea and coffee and a hair dryer but we didn't use this as I always take my own. We were shattered both nights so slept quite well. I did wake up a couple of times due to squeaky floor boards and sounded like a couple arguing but I fell straight back to sleep. The main down side was that there were so so many flies in the room! The window was open we got in the room but I didn't want to close it as then the fly's couldn't get out! I don't think this was a fault of the hotel as to be honest fruit flies are just EVERYWHERE at the moment! It was a 2 minute walk to Clapham south and both Tesco's and Sainsburys.

Its cheap and cheerful.

Firstly check-in at reception. Has a small reception/breakfast area nothing to impressive but how much time will you be spending in reception!! Fairly quick check in with payment up front..no complaints. Up the very narrow stairs that is very dated along with most of the interior but again nothing outrageously bad here! The rooms are very small as is the bathroom but clean enough for my liking.small tv in the room too but didn't get watched! I have to stress that it's by no means luxury but is a perfect base to stay in.Unusual looking bath but the shower was fine but maybe pop to the tesco right up the street for extra shower gel and shampoo!! Linen and towels were all fine. This cost us 81 euro each for 3 nights which was a bargain. My reason for the poor service vote is basically because we didn't use any services being honest! I can recommend the pizzeria just a few doors up great value and very good pizza!

The room was disgustingly filthy, but the worst was when the ceiling broke through at 2:30am and poured water straight on my head. The phone didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work in my room so I dashed to reception in my nightgown and trench coat. The clerk did run back to the room with me and just started swearing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c funny, same reaction I had. He told me I must leave all my things there and gave me another room on another floor. That room did not have bedding so I had to go back to reception and was given a third room on the top floor. This room, while tiny (bed touched 3 walls) was very clean, updated and exactly what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expected as a London 3 star. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d just dropped back to sleep and the fire alarm started going off every 10 minutes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I ended up not sleeping and spending the night trying to find another hotel.

I could not get back in the wet room where all my bags were left. So I had to go through the packed breakfast room to reception to get the key re-set, in my night gown and trench coat and socks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with my now dry and disheveled hair; humiliating really. The fact that reception announced my hotel room number twice and put me in a room next to an outside door and with iron bars on the window and a foot away from a brick wall are hardly worth mentioning after the rest of it. I booked it as part of a package and was well aware that it was a 3 star property not a 5 star. I was still unprepared for the nightmare experience. Upon leaving the hotel, the cab driver told asked if I was unhappy and told me that he picks up lots of unhappy people from the hotel each week and felt the local council should actually shut it down. The room was filthy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c really filthy (see photos). The carpeting was just laid on the floor, bunched up along all the walls. There were so many lumps in the floor that it appeared to be laid directly over cobblestone. All of this would have been passable if the carpet was not visibly disgusting. The bath room floor had something seriously wrong with it as well, but it was difficult to tell what \u00e2\u20ac\u201c had they taken up the floor tiles, and just left the old ripped linoleum? There were three different colors of mold and mildew growing in every groove in the tile. This bath was so nasty even the soap was dirty in the paper wrapper!! The tiles were actually slumped in the shower and bulging out at the bottom. The shower tiles were cracked along the top. There was also a large crack in the ceiling over the shower. The hot and cold water handles (separate spigot for each) were switched, and there was no soap holder, no toilet paper holder and no towel bar. There were huge cracks in the walls - including the tiled shower walls, the electric outlets and switches were cracked and as mentioned, the phone in the room was dead. The breakfast that is included is tea and toasted white sandwich bread \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and you have to wait for the tea as they have one single kettle for the entire dining room. In the morning I spoke with the manager, showed him the original room and showed him all the details. He agreed completely apologized and said there were slowly renovating.

I and my girlfriend decided to stay 4 days in London last weekend (20-23.06.08). We found this hotel in internet, E Dreams, and of course it marvellous in the pictures. Nice building, nice rooms, pretty clean and modern. We thought that the low prices for the rooms were actually related to the position of the hotel, which is pretty far from the centre, and we decided to book a double room...WORST DECISION OF OUR LIVES!!! When we arrived it was very late at night and we were really tired to go for any change. First we realized that the pictures of the building were maybe taken 50 years ago, because the construction is really old and not cared...First negative point. We got in and the receptionist, a cold and unfriendly person, gave us the key. We got in the room and...we REALLY REALIZED THE HUUUUUGE MISTAKE WE'VE DONE!!! The room wasn't so small, but if i say that it was filthy i am making an enormous compliment to it. All the furnitures were partially broken down and everything was full of old dust that was there since ages. The window was broken...we had luck to go there in june when it was not so cold and we didn't have to use the bed sheets...which were full of hairs of previous lucky guests. The bathroom was small...really small, and the shower box was full of mold. We slept very bad in there. The next moorning we had the \"continental breakfast\" in a room full of old cereals in the floor. Two pieces of NOT roasted bread, a bit of jam (no choice...only strawberry jam if you like it...) and a coffee served in a dirty cup (I am not joking...even the cup was dirty). At the end of the breakfast...at which we didn't eat anything, we decided to run away in order not to transform our vacation in a nightmare. Of course we didn't get the money back (everything was payed at the beginning) for the rest of the days that we were NOT going to spend at that place and we had to go to a tourist information point where we found a confortable small hotel near Victoria station that costed us just a bit more, but that was much much MUCH better. My suggestion? If we hadn't left that hotel our vacation would have been awful, so...just do NOT think only about the money when you book a hotel through internet.

The beds were bad, so bad in fact that my brother and his girlfriend who also stayed at the hotel had to swap hotels after two nights. They only had one working light bulb in their room, and when complaining were told they could be given one so they could swap themselves... Their window wasn't isolated properly either.

However - we soon realised a few things: 1. They didn't change the bed coverings once during our entire stay. 2. We never got new towels. One time I actually put them on the floor in front of the door to make my point, it only resulted in towel number three (the smallest and by this time dirtiest) disappeared - and it wasn't replaced. 3. We had to go to the reception to get more toilet paper, and the member of the staff who helped, fetched it from a nearby toilet. 4.

Each room door had a number scrawled on it with a marker pen. On entering my room, there was rank and musty smell. I guess the previous guest had been frightened to open the window to let fresh air in, due to its ground floor location, as well as the odour old and foosty furninishings.

As I arrived in London early in the morning, I was hoping to get into our room early to take a power nap, and get ready to meet my partner who was arriving later that day. I arrived at the hotel at about 10:00 a.m., and the the front desk receptionist was helpful and able to arrange for a double room to be serviced and made available to me within the hour. While the room was dull and small, it was clean apart from a couple of small oil stains on the carpet and everything worked fine for the five nights we stayed there. And even though I had to take a basement room as that was the only one available at the time of my early arrival, it had a nice big window that opened to allow in enough daylight and fresh air. The room also had a nice-sized fridge with a freezer which I was not expecting and which came in handy during the 5-night stay. After having tried the breakfast which consisted of white toast and weak coffee, we opted not to have breakfast at the hotel again, but for 42 pounds per night we were not expecting much anyway as far as the breakfast was concerned. The location itself was excellent with easy access to the London Underground and various bus routes. The Clapham Common South area is nice, including the large park right across from the hotel, restaurants and bars close by, as well as both a Tesco and a Sainsbury grocery store nearby. The street was noisy at night with both drunken bar patrons shouting at sporadic times throughout the night, as well as the London police and ambulance sirens that go on at all hours of the night. It didn't really bother us too much though, and we opted to leave the window open all night for fresh air anyway. In conclusion, for 42 pounds per night for a double room, I found the hotel excellent value and would stay there again next time in London, if on a low-budget trip.

This review on BELVEDERE HOTEL (EURO HOTEL CLAPHAM) is long but that is how bad it was - definitely worth the read...especially on the TICS / BED BUGS!! I'm a local in Clapham however I needed a room for 3nights as my partner was flying in from Italy and unfortunately I only rent a small single room. Hence I explained this with the hotel staff saying I was looking for a local hotel to do a regular monthly booking - this obviously didn't seem to have any impact on them! Firstly when we arrived we had to pay for all 3nights upfront which I did feel a bit uncomfortable with however I assumed it would be ok. Big mistake! The room was very basic - however we expected that. But never did we expect to compromise our health! The bathroom was incredibly small and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m amazed they fit a toilet in that space. The door needed to be left open. We decided to have showers but quickly discovered that there was no hot water. So eventually the staff advised that there were no other rooms available and that we would need to use the shower in a different single room on our floor whilst we stayed there! Then once coming home from dinner at 1.00am I was in bed and whilst my partner was preparing to get into bed he noticed something crawling on the pillow. We lifted up the pillow and a plague of TICS / BED BUGS came rushing out. It was the most disgusting sight I had ever seen and I was almost physically sick - not to mention that we were scratching ourselves and checking each others head for TICS that may have got in there! We asked hotel staff to come to the room immediately and in the interim I took photos. The man apologised and said I would be able to get a refund for that night. I informed him that we would not be staying in THAT room and unfortunately at 1.30am in the morning there aren't too many options as to where you can go - and also I already knew that hotels in that area were completely booked out for the weekend. Mysteriously a room became available at 2am in the morning (remembering that earlier when our shower wasn't working they said there were completely booked out!). So we had to pack up all our suitcases and get dressed and move to another floor at 2am in the morning! Needless to say after changing rooms we did not sleep at all as the sensation of the TICS/BED BUGS crawling on our faces was too vivid! Then in the morning we heard loud sounds of water dripping in our bathroom. I investigated the sound and was shocked to find the bathroom floor full of puddles as there was water leaking from the room above and coming through our ceiling! In the morning when I went downstairs to discuss this horrible experience and to organise the refund that I had been promised the night before - I was informed by the new day staff that due to the fact that another room was provided to us they had decided to not provide us with our promised refund for the first night stay! I asked to speak to the manager however he told me that the manager did not have time to speak to me! Unfortunately we had no where else to go and as stated I had already paid in full for the 3nights. So I really had no options and they played on that. I cannot believe that in 2007 a consumer does not have any rights and that this inefficiently run establishment believed they could set their own rules in London and they did! They did not care that I stated I would take this further and that I had taken photos of the TICs / BED BUGS as well as have witnesses. Actually he laughed at me and invited me to take it further - he was incredibly disrespectful. After the 3rd day of requesting to speak to the manager - and receiving the same response that the manager was too busy to speak to me - he informed me that he could provide me with a pathetic 25pound refund and that would be it! Needless to say we stayed outside of the hotel for the remaining time and only went there to sleep for a minimal 6hrs and we ensured that we laid down towels on the bed first to sleep on. The worst experience of my life - but more so from a point of view of being robbed of your consumer rights and realising that you had no power to do anything because THEY had set their own rules - and you were insignificant because they had already received your money! I have never been one to read reviews as I never really understood their purpose - but now I do! Also for the fact of paying an extra 10pounds a night in another hotel it really is worth it! Please do consider this review strongly as it is not worth taking the risk - as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m assuming the room with TICs/BED BUGS was rented out the next night - as I cant imagine a new mattress/pillows being bought!!", "Date": "March 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cA cheap option... but don't expect luxury!\u201d", "Author": "robertocusato", "ReviewID": "UR6543047", "Content": "The hotel is located in Clapham, South London, about 20 minutes from Trafalgar Square by underground on the northern line. The neighborhood is ok, some nice pubs and a great Pakistani restaurant. The rooms are... well...barely good. BAthroom was ok (nothing special of course), bed was ok... that's it. Everything else - from windows' finitures to ceiling - is very tired and in deep need of a total reshape but - said this - the place is a good option for budget and young travellers. We got a deal on www.booking.com, only 40 GBP per room per night at New Year's Eve time! Staff was very friendly and helpful. Do not expect anything from breakfast. It's a small continental one, served only 'til 9:00 am during weekdays.
