Stayed here 4 nights to enjoy the City of Angels and a few Dodgers games and I'm happy to say the hotel kept up its good reputation while maintaining attractive room rates - got a good discount rate from the Super 8 site for staying 3+ nights. Rooms are big, clean and beds are comfy. Very friendly frontdesk led by Darlene who welcome you with a smile and are very helpful. Breakfast was included in rate, with sufficient choice of bread, cereal, pastry, coffee, juice and fruit. Complimentary on site parking - which is a big plus in LA - also included. Even the neighbourhood seems to have improved - with choice of bars, clubs and a very good Thai restaurant nearby (next to Burger King on Glendale I believe). We went out on Sunset late and felt completely safe. One of the biggest assets for a baseball fan is that the Dodgers stadium is in a 10 mins walking distance, but you're also quite close to downtown, Griffith Park and Hollywood. This is the best Super 8 Motel I've experienced so far and will be my choice again for a next trip to LA.

However this particular room was, as I discovered the next morning, underneath a mezzanine where people get to other rooms. The noise of a chambermaid's trolley (I assume that's what it was!) literally sounded like bombs were falling around the bedroom. Also - use every lock available to stop chambermaid's from enterting your room. I'd love to say that in this hotel \"Do not disturb\" signs are observed - but they're not.

I had always had the impression that Super 8 was one class below Best Western. But I have to say that I was wrong. This hotel is perfect for a basic place. It has a nice and welcoming lobby with friendly staff. The room is clean and a good size. You will find a coffeemaker, fridge, microwave and TV with many channels. On each floor there is an ice machine and vending machines with drinks and snacks. Across the street there are some local/small supermarkets, but no big name grocery stores can be found in the immediate area. The price of the room is including internet and breakfast and parking which is a huge plus. The breakfast is very basic: Cereal, Milk, juice, apples bagels&creamcheese, coffee and tea. I enjoyed my stay at this place, mostly because of the room and nice atmosphere at the hotel. I have also stayed at the Dragon gate Best Western which is not too far from the Super 8 and has simular pricing. When I compare the 2 strictly on the room and hotel, I would say that both are equally nice. But the location of the Dragon Gate Best Western is better. Super 8 is on a bit of Sunset Blvd that doesn't have anything to offer. No restaurants, no shops and it is basically not close to anything. When you have a car, this is of course no problem. If you will not have a car. It is only a minor problem. Super 8 is about a 25 minute walk away from Union Station, or you can catch bus 2 or 4 (bus stop Sunset/Innes).

Negatives - the room wasn't that noisy it kept me awake but being first on the row in a motel is always going to attract more noise than the end room and there was one occassion people congregating to smoke on floor 2.

This hotel is close to the park, but not close enough to walk (safely). So there goes the best feature to this hotel. My fiance and I stayed here last minute because we wanted to catch a Dodgers game. I pretty much slept with one eye open the whole night. In my opinion, this was in a poor area based on the general vacinity of properties observed around the hotel. room was clean and as expected for a hotel in this class. This is definitely a one night stay hotel only. If you are considering multiple nights, I'm not sure why you would stay here. 1.5 stars out of 5.", "Date": "May 9, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Super 8 Motel Los Angeles Downtown", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d223054-Reviews-Super_8_Motel_Los_Angeles_Downtown-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$79 - $125*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1341 W Sunset Blvd</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">90026</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2516132", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/eb/21/eb214d9fa32c17b313356654acdba9a34large.jpg"}}
