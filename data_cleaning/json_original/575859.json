{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Bu Hao Booked this hotel through 'Rates to Go'. Hotel would not recognise the payment already paid to rates to go and I ended up paying the full amount to the hotel. The hotel also had no intention of giving me the room at the reduced price advertised on the Rates To Go Website.Stayed there for one night out of the reserved three nights. Couldn't eat breakfast even though it was advertised as being a continental breakfast.Very hard for the taxis to find. Without a hotel card it is a waste of time and money.For the sake of another $10 you can stay in a decent Chinese Hotel in a decent location.", "Date": "Oct 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR402611209", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "AScotlandChina"}, {"Content": "best value in beijing I live near Beijing and stayed here for one night before catching an international flight. I booked a single room for a very good price on \u9225\u6e06long.\u9225?The hotel is located on a peaceful alleyway near apartments, a school and a hospital. The room was small and basic, but clean with free internet (and a computer in the lobby). I had dinner at the hotel restaurant - very reasonable and tasty home-styleChinese food. The hotel is close to the Sanlitun embassy area \u9225?bars,restaurants and shopping at Yaxiu. The airport is less than a half hour away. My only complaint is that the hotel was hard to find! From Beijing train station take the subway to Dongsi shi tiao, hail a taxi heading east, then call the hotel and have them tell the driver how to get there.", "Date": "May 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR174681437", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "raku"}, {"Content": "Could be the best budget hotel in Beijing Stayed here for two nights after booking online at elong.net for 278RMB a night. The rooms are basic and maybe a little on the small side for some, but clean, comfortable and don't reek of cigerettes like so many budget places in Beijing (or China for that matter). The hotel offers free high speed internet in every room if you bring your laptop, and there's a workstation in the lobby if you haven't. The hotel is probably hard to find if you are unfamiliar with Beijing (located on a small street/alley off the 3rd Ring Road near the Changhong Bridge), so make sure you get good directions (elong also provides a mapping feature in Chinese which could be handy for printing out and showing a taxi driver). The neighborhood is tucked away but still a little lively, with a few local eatries, and a KFC and McDonalds not too far away. You can also book the hotel through Super 8's website. I would definately stay here again.", "Date": "Sep 14, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR507610531", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "wojiaotian"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d575859-r10065963-Super_8_Beijing_Tuan_Jie_Hu-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "575859", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
