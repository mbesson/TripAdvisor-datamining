The bathroom was standard, not anally clean but clean enough. Sheets changed every day. The breakfast was amazingly delicious. There's a subway station right across the street (Platz der Luftbr\u00fccke). Cheap wi-fi 1 euro / hour and free parking in the back of the building. If you're on a budget , I do recommend this no-frills hotel. Very friendly staff. But keep in mind: this is not a luxurious hotel so don't raise your expectations too much! We paid 60 euros / night. Depending on which room you get, you might hear some traffic noise -- having the windows closed solves that problem, though. I don't know how it'd be in the summer, however.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAffordable but shabby\u201d", "Author": "Nemo050", "ReviewID": "UR69586015", "Content": "Stayed at Hotel Columbia for several nights.

The location close to the concert venue was the only reason I booked this hotel through bookings.com. It was very close to the underground station Platz de Luftbrucke and the area around the hotel seemed to be lots of official buildings. We arrived at the hotel and were asked to pay cash for the room before we were given the key. When we got to the room it smelled of smoke, but as we had already paid and the man on reception didn't speak much English we didn't ask for a change of room. We decided to go for a walk around the area which was quite quiet on a Saturday (probably because the office buildings were closed) and had asked where the nearest supermarket was - to be told 2km away. It wasn't and there was a Burger King next door. The bed was comfy, bed linen was clean and the all you can eat included breakfast was good. Unless I needed to be in that part of Berlin (i.e. walking distance of the Columbiahalle) , then I can't see a reason for staying at this hotel. For 49 Euros for the room including breakfast wasn't too bad value.", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "cork ireland", "Title": "\u201cA very pleasant 5 days in the Columbia.\u201d", "Author": "oscars", "ReviewID": "UR48125269", "Content": "We spent a thoroughly enjoyable 5 nights at this hotel late October, great location for getting to both west and east Berlin, very friendly staff, small but very clean room and bathroom, and a really good breakfast with plenty of choice, without doubt, superb value for money.", "Date": "October 30, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Columbia", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d659809-Reviews-Hotel_Columbia-Berlin.html", "Price": "$59 - $126*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "659809", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f9/a2/f9a2e7f3ca691da070dbff1c44bb02e06large.jpg"}}
