After reading the terrible reviews after we had booked our two nights stay, we were pretty horrified. Baring in mind, me and my fiance have slummed it out in the likes of Pontins, Which was pretty 5*+ accommodation compared to this!!! Neither of us minded a run down Hotel, but this takes it to the absolute EXTREME!!! When we arrived, we were VERY plesantly suprized about how lovely the reception was, and the fear started to subside! that was until we ventured up the lift (which was no bigger than a shoe box) to be greated by a HORRID sound of wind blowing up the stairwell... Litterally something like off a horror film! Anyway, brushed off the pretty run down hallway and put the keys into the door... THATS WHEN THE HORROR BEGAN. The room STANK of damp... the window didnt close properly... the bathroom was covered in mould... did not even want to use the toilet!!! The shower curtain was filthy, there was hair in the sink.... BUT THATS NOTHING........ After reading revews of bed bugs, we decided to investigate ourselves. So we stripped the bed covers back, and to our discust, the sheets were ABSOLUTLEY DISGUSTING, something which many people wont realise as a normal peson wouldnt check the sheets before hopping into bed, well THANK GOD WE DID, LUCKLY, we had taken our own sheet with us, but unfortunatly not a duvet, so we resorted to sleeping underneeth our coats, as the duvet was also filthy!!! We deffinalty would have changed hotels if we could have afforded too, this hotel WAS NOT REALLY THAT CHEAP, Could have gotten a travel lodge for half the price, which we really should have done! The hotel completley spoilt our two night getaway to London, we had a fantastic time seeing shows, but the downside was coming back to FAULTY TOWERS! Now wonder the staff never asked us how our stay was when we checked out!! COULDNT WAIT TO LEAVE THAT HOTEL!!!! Would advise anyone considdering traveling to this hotel to COMPLETLEY FORGET IT... all the terrible reviews are written for a reason.... it is the complete truth.... Anyone who has the misfortune of booking before reading, like we had, to take a tent or kip rough,, would definalty be more plesant than staying here!!!!", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "K\u00f8benhavn", "Title": "\u201cNever again\u201d", "Author": "Birgitte C", "ReviewID": "UR124662713", "Content": "booked through hotels.com - and booked this hotel because it had rooms for smokers - only it did not - one big lie - and the noise, some kind of compressor and flodlights from building workd just outside my room (March 2010) - rooms: well, tried better for smaller price - but clean and friendly staff", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLooks like it was assembled from rejected materials by people who couldn't care less\u201d", "Author": "Uberredskn", "ReviewID": "UR123898578", "Content": "From exiting the lift onwards the nightmare began.

The room was so small the four single beds were just standing next to eachother without any space in between. There was of course also hardly any room to put our luggage. Compared to the room the bathroom was quite big, but on the other hand really dirty. The shower curtain had so many stains on it you can hardly see it once had been white. There was fungus everywhere and there were even holes in the ceiling. Our breakfast was included, but since it smelled that bad (we could smell it in the corridor already), we decided to just get breakfast at a little supermarket across the street. The only good thing about this place is the location. We paid around 125 pounds per night for the room which is not expensive, but for that price you can get a youth hostel that is actually much nicer and clean!!

It was cheap and although I was aware that it was a 2 star hotel....I did not expect this hotel to be the worst place ever. I was embarrassed I booked this place as I had guests from another country with me. Reception area was clean and tidy but that's where it ends. If you arrive before check in time you are told to put your bags in a small room in the basement (and not given directions on where this is, how to get there). Was told to use the stairs and 'go to the basement' and handed a key. We found out later, you could actually use the lift which would have been easier when carrying 3 pieces of luggage. The room in which we were to leave our luggage was far from secure. It held everyone else luggage as well. Given a public key, one could easily take other guests' belongings! This room was basically an old wash room with a sink. The counters were lined with old newspapers. This was NOT a great start, We returned to the hotel after check in time and were given our rooms. The lift was the size of a shoe box and could carry ONE person at a time with ONE piece of luggage. Upon leaving the lift on the 3rd floor, I was appalled to see the wall paneling falling off, water damage, wall paper peeling, worn carpet, holes in the floors and walls and heavy swinging fire doors that were too small for someone to go through easily with luggage. Our room was disgusting with 2 twin beds (we had asked for). Bugs crawled on the desk.dresser and the floor. The heat was not adjustable and it got too hot, however, with the 3 pubs within a city block of each other and so close to Fulham and the police station right next door, the noise was bad and we could not leave the window open all night. Good thing I brought ear plugs! The TV was a small 15\" thing with no remote and a missing aerial. You got 3 channels. There was no clock radio. You got two towels and 2 bars of soap.That's it. No wash rags or hand towels not even a bath mat. No hair dryer, ladies! We had to ask reception to bring a kettle as we were without one, but given one clear glass and 2 coffee cups and one plastic spoon, a few sachets of instant coffee, tea and white sugar, but no sugar substitute or decaf coffee. They really went out of there way here. We were afraid to drink the water at this point, so we bought some bottle water later. The shower took a good 10 minutes to warm up. I turned the hot tap on full blast without the cold and got a luke warm shower until the bitter end when it suddenly got hot and I nearly burnt my head. The bed itself was comfortable. The pillow was flat (but I learned to bring my own with me). The bed was made with 2 flat sheets (no duvet) and a thin bed spread. 2 blankets were on the floor of the closet but I was afraid to use them. The middle and bottom drawers of the desk/dresser were broken so that they fell out. Singing from the pubs lasted most of the night as well as sirens stopping in front of the pubs. Earl's Court Two is also across the street and lit up light a Christmas tree until wee hours of the morning. A sleep mask is a must. You are also in the flight path of Heathrow, so ever 4 minutes you can hear the planes land starting about 5 am. Breakfast was poor. You had 2 options: scrambled or fried egg with what they called a \"full English Breakfast\". It was a mini at best with egg, toast, 1 sausage, 2 pieces of hardly cooked at all bacon and baked beans with more sauce than beans. No special orders as the wait staff cannot speak English. Best to avoid this place all together. If there was an option to rate this hotel as worse than terrible, I would.

Although we knew this was a budget hotel, we were not very happy, and would not choose to stay here again. We arrived on a Wednesday after taking the short (2 minute) walk from West Brompton station. The staff who welcomed us were reasonable, not rude but not overly pleasant. Our room was situated next to the lift and was very small (smaller than it appeared on the picture). Supplied were 2 towels and 2 bars of soap, however there was no plug in the sink. There is no safe in the room - this is behind reception. Our first night left us with very little sleep - the lift's external door, corridor fire doors and room doors were all very heavy, which led to them being banged shut all night.

The breakfast was basic; toast and jam, orange juice, eggs, bacon, sausage and beans. The staff who served us were pleasant. Our second room was better, due to us being away from the lift, although just as small. This room also had a crack in the side of the bath.

This hotel was one that was sort of chosen for us, it was part of a theatre package through Superbreaks and from what my friend said was the lesser of two evils. Anyway, we arrived at around 12 noon and as expected were told that the rooms weren't ready but we could leave our bags in the \"temporary bag room\" which was one of the flats with the three or four single beds in it, we took all our valuables with us on the assumption that if anyone really felt the need to steal my knickers they could if they wanted. We were greeted by the oriental lady who has been described on here as rude, but we found her very pleasant. We had a quick drink at the Lily Langtree next door - note to self, don't book a theatre date on the day of a Chelsea Fulham Match if you want a quiet drink! Anyway I digress, after a very pleasant afternoon and early evening in the city we made our way back and got into the hotel about 8pm, where we were greeted by name, I'm presuming that we were the last people to book in. We went to our room and found it to be warm, but not overpoweringly so, the sheets were clean, and the room pleasantly airy. We were overlooking the car park and at 12 quid a night, to park we weren't expecting to hear many cars and we were right. The bathroom was sparse and a little mouldy on the ceiling, nothing an extractor fan couldn't put right. The room was dated and did need a bit of tlc, but nowhere near as bad as some of the reviews on here make out, but perhaps we were just lucky with our pick of rooms, we had hot water too, but a bath mat for both in and out of the shower would be well served here as the floor did get a little slippy and some investment in shampoo sachets, covered soap, shower cap would go a long way to adding to the ambience - as would hot chocolate sachets, not everyone likes tea and coffee. On the sunday morning we went down to \"the basement\" again, a little apprehensive, expecting all manner of whips and chains etc, but again, we were pleasantly surprised, a little 1970's nightclubby, but hey the staff were smiling! The orange wallpaper is a little overpowering some apple white would go a long way to lighten the atmosphere in this room. Breakfast was toast, tea and orange juice, can't really be called continental so perhaps they need to change the description of this as to European visitors could misconstrue this a little, but we did get three slices of bread and it was warm and fresh and delivered with a very cheery disposition. On the whole, the hotel had its good points, but a couple of weeks closedown during a quiet period to put right all the little niggly bits and it could be a really nice hotel, i think the trouble is that they've started with the reception before working on the rooms so you get a sort of reverse perspective, people expect big things but then are a little disappointed with the rooms, perhaps if reception had been left to last and the bedrooms had been worked on it would have made people far more affable in their comments. Location wise it is excellently situated, there are some nice pubs and restaurants nearby and its fab for the tube (well not on weekends where the district line is shut) and if you are going to Earls Court for anything then this is deffo the place for you, you could see Earls Court 2 from our window.

That should have been my warning sign!! On check-in at 10pm at night, we were asked to pay for parking for 3 nights in advance (\u00c2\u00a336), which I did and was then told to move my car as I parked where vans park. I said there was no sign saying vans only, but I was told it was there. It must be invisible!! Anyway at 10pm with no light on in the car park (there is one, the reception just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to put it on) I moved my car in the awkward and cramped car park. I then got the room key and that is when I had a freak out! You can only get 1 person and 1 suitcase at a time into the elevator or 2 people and no bags. When we got out on to the 1st floor the doors were cracked and broken, stains on the carpet, wallpaper falling off and cracks in the ceiling. We got to the room and I had enough. The double bed was against a side and back wall, there was 1 foot width of space at the side of the bed to the window, and there was wallpaper hanging off the wall on to the pillow. There was also a small shelf area and a cupboard but nowhere to put our 2 suitcases except on the bed itself. I went back to reception and asked for a bigger room but was told only a twin was available. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t book a twin. I booked a double and asked how they could expect 2 people to stay in that room and have room for bags. The receptionist told me I could take the twin and move the beds around and when I asked if he would help us do that, he said no as it was light enough for us to move ourselves! This time, we got the lift to the 2nd floor. This was as bad if not worse than the 1st as some of the light casing was broken and there were wires on view. We moved the twin beds together to create a double and with the extra space managed to put our cases between the bed and the wall. This was not good when we were trying to move I can tell you. The windows were dirty, the frames cracked, and there was no air con so the room was roasting hot. We had to sleep with the windows open, if you could call the 3 nights of tossing and turning from nightmares thinking I was in Bates Motel sleep!! Our room was at the front so it was on the main road where there is constant traffic so constant noise too. We had 1 bath towel and 1 hand towel for the 2 of us and only 1 pillow each but we did ask and get more. There is no hair dryer and the coffee mugs were dirty and the coffee sachets covered in something sticky so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t chance using them! I know this hotel was ridiculously cheap at \u00c2\u00a380 a night for London and I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really expecting air con, but 2 feet of space, a clean glass and somewhere to put my suitcase is not too much to ask for an establishment that has the cheek to call itself a hotel! On our 1st morning we went into the small cramped bathroom where we were greeted by the lovely sight of the pipes of our sink uncovered, dusty and very very worn. And then we spotted the previous guests dirty face cloth still on the shower rail. On our way down to breakfast we gave it to reception who did not say a word! No apology. Nada! There are signs all over the hotel about how they will not accept liability for items stolen from your room but you can leave them with reception to lock away. We had laptops with us and practically had to argue with reception for them to take them behind for us as if we had left them in the rooms and anything did happen then what would happen? Were they just paranoid or is there a history of theft? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know but this made me a little scared to be honest as it was being made into such a big deal! The breakfast room is in the basement. You know this will be a disaster! The stairs on the way down had several empty bottles of alcohol lying on them so some guests had had a party the night before and not only was it not cleared, it was a health and safety problem! The smell and the heat of the breakfast room was disgusting. Luckily though we managed to get some boxed cereal. While the kitchen looked clean enough the smell was enough to make us loose our appetites and cereal was all we could manage. And for future reference, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the cereal sitting out, but we saw empty boxes and asked for some. Service with a smile this was not! More like service with a sneer! 10 minutes to get a cup of coffee and warm milk for the cereal! We decided to use the toilet beside the breakfast room on our way out to save us going back to the hell hole of a room. This was a mistake. The ladies had a dirty towel lying on the floor and I gagged when I saw the state of the toilet which was covered in excrement. I practically ran out of there! I have seen some nasty public toilets in my time, but in a hotel? It was just wrong! The next 2 days were pretty much the same. Then on our final day (checkout was 11am) I asked if we could leave the car in the car park until 5pm as we did not check-in until 10pm and I had paid for 3 nights parking. First of all I was told \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNo. You have only paid for 1 night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. I said I had paid for 3. Just by chance I kept the receipt and I showed it to the receptionist who still didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe me until she could find a hand written record of it. When I told her which was my car I was then told \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcYou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the owner. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that car was\u00e2\u20ac\u2122! Even though I gave them my registration at check-in?? Crazy! When I asked again if I could leave my car until 5pm I was told \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNo, you must pay another \u00c2\u00a312\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Thankfully the area is not a controlled parking zone on Sundays so I left and found a parking space on the street. No way was I ever going to give them another penny! At \u00c2\u00a380 / night... yes this is very cheap for London... but No way will I stay there again. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth paying the extra for a comfortable nights\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sleep and some sanity!! Over a week later I still get shivers thinking about how awful it was!

Having the appearance of a multi-storey carpark-come-detention centre does little to promote business, and judging by the turnout at breakfast this is the case, perhaps however it was spending the night in the Hotel of Horrors that left the guests in no mood for 2 rounds of cold toast and a packet of marmalade (the 'large continental breakfast').

The lift, more like a shaft, appears to have be taken from a 1940's black and white movie and is only big enough for 2 without luggage. So the stairs were the only option. I'm not sure what the disabled with wheelchairs do? The double rooms were smaller than tiny, darker than black and simpler than basic. Deco was old and awful. The bed should have had a warning: Spring Attack; the pillows were flater than feathers. The drinks tray was covered with dust (never used, replaced or cleaned) and the argos kettle was filthy. The carpet was last replaced many moons ago. The bathroom, well there's nothing to say about the bathroom. It was very basic and a tight squeeze with no ventillation. After a shower, the room turns into a sauna. Hot, sticky and sweaty. Breakfast is served in the basement. As you walk down the stairs to the basement you'll catch a wiff of rising damp. Perfect to put you off the food. The cantine staff were poor. Breakfast was basic - eggs, toast and beans. No other facilities were advertised.

They are very basic which you would expect from a budget hotel, but the kettle worked and coffee and tea were provided. The bed sheets were clean and crisp, starched white. No stains or anything else as suggested by some reviews on here. Pillows were wafer thin though and you ended up with an origami swan by the end of the night!!! We think that the rooms have been recently refurbished as cant believe some of the bad reviews on this and other sites. Although, the hotel may have changed the rooms and cleaned up on thier act abit if they have read some of these reviews. Do not use the lift if you are claustraphobic as they are very small - will fit 3/4 people in there. Lots of people moaned about this fact in their review. However, there are 2 lifts and even if you have to wait for the next one it only takes a couple of mins. Failing that, use the stairs!! The hotel as its own undercover secure carpark which cost \u00c2\u00a312 for 24 hours which is much cheaper than NCP parking and very convenient. \"Continental\" breakfast is included, although in laymans terms this means toast!! You also get tea and coffee and orange juice.English breakfast was provided but this was extra, I think about \u00c2\u00a310. The restaurant is downstairs in the basement....but dont let this put you off as it was decorated ok and wasnt at all dingy. It was clean and the staff were efficent and helpful. We had to wait for a table to become free, but as soon as the people left they were ushering us to the table whilst cleaning it. So quick.... Overall, this is a good budget hotel at a very reasonable price. It is London so it isnt a \"cheap\" nights stay, but then you would be hard pushed to find somewhere else in London for this price. Would recommend this as long as you dont go expecting gold plated taps and HILTON logos on the carpets! Ideal for a short break....afterall, you only sleep in the room and not spend your whole trip in it!!", "Date": "June 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devon, England", "Title": "\u201cAshamed\u201d", "Author": "Dink8", "ReviewID": "UR16170276", "Content": "As an Englishman I was ashamed to stay here - did all the foreign tourists staying at the same time think this is typical of English hotel keeping and hospitality?

No cereals, fruit etc. Staff were too busy to demonstrate any hospitality skills. I have been in the hotel business for all my working life and it saddens me that London has hotels such as this - it would not take a lot to do things right.

It wasn't very quiet. I wasn't impressed with the guests who were there and I would not want students to be exposed to that kind of behaviour.

OK, so now your on the correct floor, wait where is my room, well some rooms don't even have numbers on their so you have to assume. OK, found my room, now how do I get in. Picture this, you open the door in, usually only opens about halfway, then you squeeze yourself into the hallway, step into the bathroom to the right, step back out and now your in your room. Not quite, you now have to roll over the bed which blocks the entrance to the bed area. You have now settled in, put your clothes always in a hanger-less closet, taken a shower in a cold water, curtain-less, slippery shower. Don't forget to ask for a large towel between 8:00 and 10:00 AM otherwise you will dry off with a small, one square foot towel. You want to go to bed now.. Your mattress is like a dull acupuncture session. The springs will leave bruises on your back and the squeak can be hear for miles. Your television will have ten channel buttons but half of the buttons will take you to the same channel. Also, great view, of the planes that fly into Heathrow every minute, literally.
