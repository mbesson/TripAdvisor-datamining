Our flight was delayed and we ended up arriving around midnight instead of the planned 5pm, but the religious sister who greeted us was really gracious at our lateness. Their massive front door was clearly shut and locked yet there she was smiling and welcoming. We loved the ambience. Yes it is basic but it was clean and whisper quiet as our room faced inwards. We love the roof terrace and took lots of pictures of Rome. Location wise it was very convenient with ATMs, banks, supermarket and transport a short stroll away. There is no WIFI and TV which was great for the teen children to wean off. There is a TV room but most channels are in Italian language. It was warm for winter. If you want WIFI there are wifi zone restaurants nearby but you need to have a meal. We really liked the place even though the mod cons ie TV AND WIFI was not available. By the way, the convent can organise taxi pickup for you.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bari, Italy", "Title": "\u201cA theft in a hotel run by nuns.\u201d", "Author": "alfredva", "ReviewID": "UR119761006", "Content": "Coming back from a long trip,we decided to spend the night at Suore di Santa Elisabetta-Rome- before resuming our trip home the following day.The room was spacious,but the bathroom ,outside the room(no.11) on a balcony, had the water fixtures out of order and we couldnt take a shower. But the problem has been another..the following day,as our train was at 3:00 pm, we asked the lady at the reception if we could leave our trolleys there until 2:00 pm; we were asked to leave them in a small room with the lady's assurance that they were safe as they had not a lock. When we arrived home I discovered my jewels were no longer in my trolley. I called but the nun who answered told me I was mistaken;then I wrote a letter to the Nun responsible for the hotel describing the event and asking for a reply which,after more than a week, has not yet arrived.

I had requested a quad room when booking at was told none were available so we reserved two rooms, each with two twin beds and a shared bath for our family of 4. The week before leaving for Italy I reconfirmed and asked if any quads were available and there was, so we switched to that. Our room was rather oddly located, directly off the breakfast rooms (have to walk through the breakfast rooms to get to it) but it was huge and had a private bath. The room had 5 twin beds, several closet units and a table with chairs. The ceiling must have been 20-25 feet high and was painted with beautiful scenes. The beds were actually the most comfortable of any we encountered in Italy, which surprised us. It was not a fancy room, but everything was clean and the size was great. Before we reserved the convent I read other reviews and was fully expecting dry rolls and weak tea for breakfast, but in reality the breakfast is pretty good. Each day there was yogurt, cereal, muesli, meat, cheese and huge rolls. Coffee (my husband thought it was the best coffee of the trip), tea and juice were also served. It was totally adequate and filling-a great surprise! I didn't think the 11pm lockout was going to be a problem for us since we'd be tired after a long day of sight-seeing, but we did have to keep track of the time. Our Rome routine seemed to become one of hitting the big sites in the morning and early afternoon, then returning to the room for a couple hours of relaxation during the heat of the day and then heading back out at about 6-7pm. We would usually eat dinner and do one of Rick Steves' Rome walks and then scurry back to the convent just before 11pm. The nuns don't speak a lot of English but somehow it was not hard to communicate with them. They helped us try to make a couple of museum reservations and also booked a taxi to the airport for us, so they are very helpful. We enjoyed the terrace on the roof of the convent. One night we just relaxed for a little bit and took in the view. Another night we picked up food at a market and ate dinner at one of the tables. It's a really nice quiet spot in the midst of the Rome hustle and bustle. The location of the convent is very good. It's a short walk to the main train station but is also close enough to several sites to walk. On our first night in Rome we had taken the train to a site and then decided to walk back and along our walk we just happened upon the Coloseum, all lit up in the darkness. Pretty cool! We were surprised by how close it is to the convent but then realized we could see it from the terrace. The one downside to the convent is the lack of air conditioning. Our room had two huge windows but we had to close them at night because of the noise from a bar just down the street, so it felt a bit toasty. Not miserably hot but it would have been more comfortable with AC. For us it was not something that would keep us from staying there again, just something you should be aware of. We would stay at the convent again. It's a pretty unique place to stay, good breakfast, great price and location!", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wamberal", "Title": "\u201cWonderful - would recommend staying here\u201d", "Author": "buttsieAustralia", "ReviewID": "UR103819255", "Content": "My husband and I travelled Europe in Sept/Oct 10 ' with our 18 year old son.

There was a musky smell from the shower drain, but the sisters left an air freshener that automatically dispense fragrance. You can close the bathroom door during the night and all is well. The rooftop terrace was spectacular. It was fairly quiet during dusk and dawn and you could very well have the entire terrance for yourself to watch the sunset.

The hotel is a convent run by Polish nuns who may or may not speak English. If you want to immerse yourself in Rome without the insulation of big, touristy places, stay here. The hotel itself is in a very Roman neighborhood, four or five blocks from the Termini Station. We looked for the steeples of the Santa Maria Maggiore Church to find our way there. Once you find the church, pass directly across the square in front, and you will cross a busy street with an information booth directly across. From there, the hotel is up the hill behind the booth. It has no sign, only the number 9. It is on the Via del Olmata, so make sure you're on that street. We had to be buzzed into the place, and got room 32, which was very spacious. It also had three twin beds, which we requested. Breakfast was a very hard loaf of bread with butter and jelly. That's it. We also had a choice of coffee, or hot or cold milk (not so cold). However, we could live with the breakfast for the price, size, and cleanliness of the room. We also really liked the rooftop terrace. We ate all our evening meals there, and had a great view of the Coliseum, Victor Emmanuel Monument, and even St. Paul's in the distance. There is an SMA grocery store across the square from the Santa Maria Maggiore church, and we bought picnic supplies there. I would recommend this place if you don't mind the bare necessities. We felt safe there, and we loved practicing our Italian on the nuns at the check-in desk.", "Date": "July 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Junction, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay with the Sisters\u201d", "Author": "MTJTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR17263854", "Content": "My daughter and I really enjoyed our stay at the convent.

I fact, there was a mouldy smell in the beginning, but after tracing the stench back to its origin in the shower drain it could easily be prevented by putting a folded plastic bag over it and weighing it down with a heavier item. Furthermore, number 14 is equipped with ancient paintings and a beautiful coffered ceiling. The beds are comfortable and the room provides an enourmous lot of space. As I heard and eventually saw, the equipment of the other rooms is more modern. We spent a fabulous week in the convent. Every single one of the nuns was outstandingly friendly, the breakfast coffee is excellent and the location perfect. Termini, Rome's major railway, metro and bus station, is a 10 minute walk away. Just across the street a cosy Irish Pub can be found and an excellent ice cream parlour (L'Orso Bianco) is just around the corner. And the view from the terrace is overwhelming, the Colosseum and St. Peter's could easily be spotted. The only downside is the curfew at 11pm. The early breakfast time (7am onwards, Sun 8pm onwards) on the other hand were quite handy, as we set out early and thus could make the most of the day.
