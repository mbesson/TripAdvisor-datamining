{"Reviews": [{"Content": "First Rate Service We had stayed at another hotel in this chain during our trip and was impressed. We found an America's Best Value Inn on our GPS and it looked to be in a good location and has off street parking. We made our reservation through America's Best Value Inn's main phone number. This one is within walking distance to The Presidio and MANY bars and restaurants. The rate was very low considering the location but what impressed us the most was the service. I have never received that level of service from a budget hotel/motel. Their staff will go to great lengths to make sure the guests are comfortable.

There was a small refrigerator in the room, but no coffee maker. Oh well, I can live with that. Plenty of channels on the TV. My room was at the back of the property, and I think I had no neighbors, so my stay was very quiet -- except for someone who marched loudly down the outside walkway at 3:00 a.m.! Can't blame the management for that, though. The managers were friendly, efficient and courteous. Parking is limited, but again that was no problem.

This is the review that Expedia WOULDN'T let me post:My wife and I booked this place through Expedia.

We were assigned room 218, which according to the elevator is on the THIRD floor. (We'll use that as benchmark warning for all hotels in the future.)The room was servicable, and I decided to plonk down on the bed for a quick nap before we hit the town.I pulled the sheets back, and dropped down into a recent PUDDLE of undetermined liquid on the mattress! (Yes, it was at crotch level, and we came to the same conclusion as to its origin.)We called the front desk and a maid arrived promptly. She surveyed the situation and called the front desk for further assistance.A man arrived shortly therafter, surveyed the situation, and asked me -- accusingly -- WHAT DID YOU DO?I set him straight, and they proceeded to strip the bed, and then they FLIPPED the soaking wet mattress OVER, so that the wetness would be the problem of room 118 (on the second floor).By this time we were on the phone to Expedia, demanding to change our hotel. Expedia said they would find us a room at another hotel OWNED BY THE SAME GUY, but we declined, as not changing the sheets between guests would seem to be an ownership problem.We we returned home, and tried to post this review to Expedia, we discovered that we weren't the first people to discover that this property didn't always change sheets between guests, but we may have been the first to discover a fresh puddle of evidence!", "Date": "May 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR105511817", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "acedesone"}, {"Content": "Great price, great location, friendly informative staff, and clean room!

We had some info on this motel from another source and decided to give it a try. Having lived some years in SF I knew Lombard St. might not be ideal, but since we had a car the free parking was enticing, and free breakfast was mentioned... all in all maybe a good deal.WRONG! The staff was continually berating us and others including shouting matches long into the night that even drowned out the horrendous traffic.Breakfast was 1 old cello-wrapped danish per person distributed like in maximum security and some WMD coffee.The parking lot was floodlit to the point you could read in bed all night even with curtains drawn.verdict: double plus ungood.", "Date": "Sep 16, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR654976390", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "In Lombard street c'\u732b di meglio   showReview(20745065, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR315370717", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "PaolaMarcoGenova"}, {"Content": "Bon Rapport Qualit\u8305/Prix   showReview(20017118, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR908759113", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "cthsxm"}, {"Content": "bon rapport qualit\u8305/prix pour un hotel \u813f San Francisco   showReview(19631449, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR196750330", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Pratique   showReview(19631448, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR722764622", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Un peu d\u8305\u83bdus   showReview(18536475, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR820477651", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "bien pla\u83bd\u8305   showReview(18536474, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR845607045", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Excellent rapport qualit\u8305 / prix   showReview(17429521, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR288875963", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Einfach, aber noch akzeptabel   showReview(16265675, 'full');", "Date": "May 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR237820438", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Reigelser"}, {"Content": "bien plac\u8305   showReview(16602717, 'full');", "Date": "May 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR747214135", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "F\u7709r San Francisco nimmt man einiges in Kauf   showReview(11301808, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR436844788", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "pas decu   showReview(11301807, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR241457094", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Molto Spartano!   showReview(11664776, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR268488390", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d267364-r23283258-Americas_Best_Value_Inn_Golden_Gate-San_Francisco_California.html", "HotelID": "267364", "Price": "$132"}}
