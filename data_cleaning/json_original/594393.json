The Ayasofya & Blue Mosque are in walking distance and their domes and minarets can be seen from the rooftop. I really enjoyed my stay here. The owner and the front desk agent were so helpful with everything. The hotel is clean. The room had hardwood floors and a tiled bathroom. I think the most interesting aspect of the experience was the street on which Gul Sultan is located. At night the street comes alive with all the noise affliated with bars and people having a good time. In fact, it was noisey past 2am. There are so many other American English speaking tourists around and all the merchants and businesses catered to their needs very well. I would not recommend this place to a family seeking quite and refuge from the bustle of Istanbul, but I would recommend it to young adults or people 40 and under who want to have a good time and be in a safe, clean and well maintained place. Airport transportation can be arranged by the front desk, internet service is great, breakfast was good..", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milton Keynes, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cValue for money and centrally located\u201d", "Author": "Supratim", "ReviewID": "UR105597202", "Content": "This hotel was a deal !

The good - prices (the best we could find roaming around), very clean rooms and bathrooms, location in Sultanahmet, friendly managers, free Internet (patchy reception on 2nd floor). The bad - No windows in the back room! breakfast has literally nothing - we finished bread baskets with butter and cheese but we didn't expect anything the low price so can ignore or simply eat elsewhere. I see pictures here of the terrace but we had a closed terrace probably cause of the weather. if it is open that would be a plus. The hotel is worth it since hostels charge you similar or higher rates. If you plan to spend all your time roaming in Istanbul and coming back only for sleep or breaks it is a brilliant place.

Our room shared a common wall with the hostel and although you could not hear voices through the wall, every time anyone dragged a chair across the tiled floor in the common meal and bar room (open 24 hours) you could hear it through the wall. Despite the double glazed windows the noise from the many open-air restaurants in the street below disturbed our sleep. Most nights it died down around 2am but one night it went on until 4.30am. The breakfast was very disappointing. We were the only patrons at the hotel and we were given one egg, one bread roll, selection of jams, 2 small pieces of packaged cake, a few slices of tomatoes and cucumber and tea or coffee.

The hotel owner Mr Hamit is very nice and always give you a big welcome whenever you arrive.
