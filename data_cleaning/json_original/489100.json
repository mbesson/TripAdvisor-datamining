When I arrived in Barcelona and checked the paperwork sent by this company I soon found out that they had not bothered to include any postal address or telephone number for the hotel. I even asked a local taxi driver to take me there and he had not heard of the place either. This rseulted in me having to phone England to find out where I was actually going. (I should have smelt a rat right there). When I eventually arrived at the hotel I found out that the room I was staying in had a boarded up window. (not the best view I have ever enjoyed). In the morning I went down to get breakfast only to be offered a map to take me to another hotel where breakfast (which was not very nice at all) was served. This was the only day that I had in Barcelona and the icing on the cake for me was that there was no left luggage facility in the hotel resulting in me then having to go to the airport for most of the day as this was my only option to keep my suitcases safe. This was not how I had hoped to spend my birthday and due to the incompetence of both majorcruise.co.uk and the Lyon Hotel I missed out on having any chance of sightseeing in Barcelona (something that I was obviously looking forward to). On return to Scotland I have made a variety of complaints to majorcruise.co.uk in writing, over the telephone and by e-mail and at the time of writing have had no satisfactory response. They have even tryed to deny recieving my e-mails which I was then able to prove was a complete and utter lye. I would stongly advise anyone who considering using majorcruise.co.uk or the Hotel Lyon to think seriously about trying to book with someone else. Or be prepared to have your holiday ruined.

The place is relativley clean and ok to find - it's the top half of an apartment building off a side road. My room was right near reception and as other posts have explained, it is a very noisy hotel. Though I am a good sleeper so whilst it was annoying when it occurred it was easily forgotten by breakfast - which I strongly recommend that you do not use the hotel (down the road) - be like a local and have a delicious breakfast at a nearby caf\u00e9! Please note - I was the victim of an attempted assault during my stay in Barcelona. I was waiting for my partner in the park near the hotel - when three men tried to steal my DSLR camera through an orchestrated series of events: one squirted a thick liquid on my back (I think it was make-up), another tried to convince me it was bird droppings and offered me a tissue whilst the third swooped in a literally tried to grab the camera from my hands - luckily I wasn't that slow and they ran away.

Due to the fact it occupies the \"second\" floor of an apartment block, its pretty difficult to find. I say \"second\" floor because in actual fact you climb about four flights of stairs to get there. There is a lift but I didn't think my travel insurance covered me for death whilst in such a contraption. Arriving in the daytime you will be greeted and looked after by \"Grandma Lyon\" who will cater for your every desire. The rooms, though basic, are clean and comfy. Dont expect anything like internet connections, fax, turn-in service (unless you particularly like Grandma Lyon, or she likes you), or room service. Air con comprises a hole in the window which is partially covered by a wooden block - this is a converted flat with a local feel about it. Everybody looks after themselves. I would particularly recommend this place for Spanish omlette lovers. The best bit though is the night porter. What a hoot he is. He absolutely LOVES fooling around and he will not miss an opportunity to play a practical joke on you! He's a terrific bloke. I advise that you play a joke on him first, before he gets you. You'll know he's in when you press the buzzer outside and are greeted with a deep growling \"Siiiiiiiii.....?\" Considering the high prices of other hotels in Barcelona, this is a gem of a find.
