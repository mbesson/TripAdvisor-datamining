The breakfast was self service and tried to cater for most tastes from English breakfast(ish) to pastries, fruit and cereal. Staff were helpful and polite.

It\u2019s about 5 minutes walk to metro Castro Pretorio station or 15 minutes walk to Termini railway station. There are two supermarkets locate near the hotel and few restaurants around the area. The meals in the restaurants around the hotel is much better value than those you can find near the main tourist attraction like Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain. There is no tea or coffee making facilities in the room but they can bring the facilities to you if you request for it but it depends on availability. We request for it upon arrival. Luckily, they sent the tea and coffee facilities to us on the 2nd day of our stay. The room is surprisingly spacious and has a samll balcony. I really love the bed in our room, it\u2019s so comfortable. I also love the stereo system in the room. As we brought some music CDs with us, we could play our favourite songs in the room. The good thing is they have microphone connect to the bathroom, we listened to the songs while enjoying the bath, too. Breakfast is Ok but nothing surprising. Free internet service is also available.

We were back last week for the first time in almost three years, The Canada is as good as we remember. It is family run (Pucci family) and many of the staff are still there since we first went the in 2000. While there I was celebrating a significant birthday (one with a zero at the end) and the reception staff must have noticed when entering my passport details. Apart from being wished Happy Birthday first thing on the morning a Bottle of Prosecco, chocolates and a gift were left in our room. I suppose this is what sums up the Canada management and staff: attention to detail in very comfortable surroundings. The rooms and public areas are very well decorated spotlessly clean. The rooms are very spacious and well furnished with mostly antique free standing furniture. A number of the \"superior rooms\" are laid out Suite style with a separate sitting area from the bedroom. The buffet breakfast is great with pleny of choice to set you up for the day. Snacks can be had in the bar during the day. In the evening a choice of cold snacks are available free in the bar. Prices in the bar are excellent and it is very relaxing if all you want is a quiet drink or a coffee. The hotel is close to Termini station. This is very convenient for the express train and buses from the airport as well as it being the intersection of Rome's two Metro lines. To walk to the Canada from Termini find your way the Termini exit on Via Marsala. Look for a Catholic Church across the street and Via Vicenza runs along the side of the church. A number of bus routes also start/terminate in front of Termini and will enable you to get to many parts of Rome quite easily. Nearer the hotel on Piazza Independenza is the terminus for two useful busses, the 75 which will bring you to Trastevere via the Colosseum and the 85 which also goes to the Forum and Colosseum. The quickest way from the hotel to the Colosseum is to take the metro from Castro Pretoria station which is beside the hotel. Some guidebooks will warn you about staying near Termini. Don't be put off by this in relation to Canada's location. In all the times we have stayed we have never had the slightest problem. The area around the Canada has a number of Government Ministries, consulates , a University, hospital and a large police station and so there a large number of Italian workers on the streets and using the bars and restaurants. In fact we feel much safer in this area of Rome than in many parts of other European or North American cities that we have visited. The Canada is a real gem. While it is three star the accommodation and service are far better than some five star establishments I have stayed in.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cLove this place!

The hotel bar serves drinks at very reasonable prices, along with free appetizers in the evening. The location, for me, is perfect. It is close enough to walk from Termini (about 5 blocks) and there is another metro stop just around the corner (Castro Pretorio). This allows you to come and go as you please throughout the day using the all-day public transit ticket. The environs are quiet at night and on weekends with little or no evidence of the sketchy conditions that can occur closer to Termini. Free wi-fi is a nice plus too.

Choosing a hotel is important, and after researching Trip Advisor decided on Hotel Canada. Firstly, I want to say that there are absolutely no regrets about this choice. Other reviews are almost spot-on. Location. Hotel Canada is about 10 minutes walk from Termini rail and bus station. You could take the Metro for one stop, but it's really not worth it. If you are disabled or have mobility problems, you should be aware that the walk from Termini involves some cobbled streets and very uneven pavements. You should not think that this hotel is very close to the major tourist sites, it's not. However they are not far. The Historic areas (Colosseum, Forum, Trevi, Pantheon etc) are about 25 or so minutes walk. Getting there is ok, it's downhill, but coming back is of course uphill. I lost a few pounds in weight over three days walking ! The Castro Pretorio metro station almost outside the hotel, and the Rome metro is easy to use. Any one journey costs \u20ac1 and an all day ticket is \u20ac4, great value. Get on the train at Castro Pretorio, get off a few minutes later at Colosseo which is right at The Colosseum. The front desk staff of the hotel are really very good, polite, helpful, informative, and very happy to answer questions no matter how silly. In the lobby of the hotel was a pad of large city maps. Just tear one off, fold it and off you go ! Really useful. Rooms are classical Italian style. Large conventional beds (very comfy !) tiled floors. Some furniture, TV, CD Player. Good bathroom, WC, Bidet, Bath/Shower, good selection of toiletries, and disposable slippers ! There were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room, but this is normal in Italy and most of continental Europe. Our room was 526 on the 5th Floor. The lift is interesting and takes a bit of getting used to. It's an old fashioned type with gates that you have to pull open, but the gate to go in is not the same as the gate to get out ! Great fun. Although our room overlooked a very busy street, there was almost no noise due to very good sound insulation. We didn\u2019t use the bar, but breakfast is very good. The best thing is that it is available until 10.30am, very civilized ! Good selection of cheeses, cold meats, pastries, fruit and some hot items usually eggs and ham or bacon of sorts. There is no restaurant in the hotel, but there are plenty of places very nearby. Ristorante 3 Arches just around the corner is good. I cannot comment on cost or value for money, the hotel was included in the flights and hotel Air Miles package. Overall we were really very happy, and recommend this hotel. My wife is already saying that she wants to go back to Rome to see more.

I have stayed at this hotel twice and my husband 3 times all within the last 30days (and we are booked in for the next two separate weeks as well) Each time a different room and each experience has been a double thumbs up success! We frequently roll work in to pleasure and stay over the weekend when there is work two weeks back to back. The staff is wonderful. The hotel rooms nicely appointed, each with their own character, and all have been very clean. The price is reasonable (at least this time of year), breakfast is well rounded and included, wifi is complimentary (not at great speed but good for free), and there is a nicely appointed lobby with a small bar with snacks that opens in the evenings. The location is great for walking to and from the Termini (5min) and couldn\u2019t be more ideal for our business needs but it is an extra 10minutes away from some of the main tourist roads and big attractions. This really isn\u2019t a problem; who comes to roam and doesn\u2019t expect to (or wants to) walk this incredible city?! If your feet fail and you can\u2019t stand the thought of walking any further this hotel still works fine because as I said, you are a mere 5min walk from the Termini where you will find the Metro, buses and a taxi line! Now that all the due praise has been given let me layout for you a few of their short-comings (no where is perfect) that we encountered. *There is no water kettle in the room. This may not effect you but being frequent travelers we have become accustom to hot tea on demand as well as enjoying a bit of oatmeal (that we bring ourselves) before, or after, a long day. *The queen bed is simply two twin beds positioned together on a very basic, no frills frame. This is quite common in the whole of Europe but is still uncomfortable for any couple that enjoys sleeping next to each other. *We have twice been given a room with a very narrow bathtub that thankfully had a showerhead on the wall. The problem with the configuration is that the head was in the middle of the tub length so that you had very little space to actually shower and water typically would spill out one side or the other because of where the water hit on the wall\u2026 (see pictures) *The internet is slow (especially during peak time) and, depending on your room, you have to be careful where you sit to access it, not all seats in your room are close enough to the signal to use it. But, I say again, it is free and not wired! **The biggest problem we encountered (and continue to encounter) is the complete disregard for the \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d light and door hang. Although we never had a problem with intrusion while we were in the room every time we would leave for dinner or otherwise they would enter our room and tidy up (once per day) regardless of what kind of notice they were given at the door. You must leave your room key at the front desk when you go out so they are always aware of when you finally vacate the room so they can do their daily cleaning. It is a nice gesture that they REALLY want you to have a clean room but as I said before, we are frequent travelers and sometimes we don\u2019t want to put all of our valuables away and \u201ctidy-up\u201d so the room is viewable to our hosts. Sometimes we just want to pop out for a quick bite and expect that the issued \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d sign will be respected \u2013 sadly, not here. \u2639 I could probably ask upon leaving for them not to enter but right now it is the principle of it and it definitely drives me up the wall! So there you have it, my opinion. As a final note when I have visited we were given room 328 which looked over Viale Castro Pretorio. It was nice not to be looking into another building but the room was quite loud when the windows were open. We have also stayed in 112; this is a corner room that looks out over Vicenza and Via Sommacampagna ( I think), this was a little loud in the mornings and in the evening around dinner time but was livable. My husband has stayed in a room that overlooked the shared courtyard and has attested to the dead silence that the location offered but at the same time you risk looking into other rooms and homes as well as loosing almost all natural light because of the further 6 floors above you in every direction. Hope this helped. Enjoy Rome!

One strange thing though; we were notified upfront by our reservation that we had to pay a citytax. That isn't very unusual for us but when checking out we had to pay it in cash, while I'm used that it is already taken care of with the roomprice or it's charged onto the roomaccount and you can pay for it (with credit card) when you check out by signing the bill.

We had booked into another hotel just 2 minutes walk from here, (on Via San Martino) but to our horror, it was so poor we decided to find somewhere better. After trying a handful of places around the block, we stumbled into Canada House, whereby we were stunned by the classical themed architecture, paintings and furniture in a modern and stylish hotel. The receptionist (who spoke decent English) was most helpful and offered to show us the room prior to booking. We accepted and couldn't let the opportunity slip. Room - Lovely old style theme, 4 poster bed etc. Was a little noisy when window is open, and although there wasn't much of a view from it, it didn't matter as you'll spend no time in the room when you're in Rome, and when the window is closed the room is silent, so sleeping is easy. Beds very comfortable, and I have a bad back so this is a good recommendation. Decent sized safe to fit a handful of things in, multiple tv stations, and very spacious bathroom. Air conditioning quite good also. Hotel itself - Corridors were nicely styled, lift had that classic theme about it with the transparent mesh shaft, and the 2 doors that opened inwards like something from a Bogart movie. Bar - Comfortable and very reasonably priced. Free internet usage for guests although the lone computer was unavailable at times. Breakfast - Buffet style, scrambled eggs, sausages, yoghurt, breads, pastries, fruits, cereals, coffee, tea, juice etc all available. I personally didn't like the bacon, sausages and some of the bread but this was par for the course of my stay in Italy, so the hotel can't be blamed for poor food. Staff - All had decent English, enough to get you by anyway. Quite friendly and helpful. A porter insisted on carrying our bags to the room for us. Bad points? - Bathroom had no window and could get steamy and very hot for a long time after a shower. No key was available to lock bathroom from inside. I prefer a shower with a proper door so was disappointed to see a curtain in this bathroom. If you're not mad into continental breakfasts then you won't be thrilled by the breakfast, however, it is ok. Value - \u20ac189 per night between 3 people. For the room, location, friendliness of staff, close proximity to 2 excellent restaurants on the same street, and the fact that Termini is 5 mins walk away, I felt that this represented excellent value.

Our last trip was about ten years ago (which was noted and remembered at the front desk when we checked in!) We were so impressed last time, we couldn't imagine staying anywhere else in Rome. First, the hotel itself is elegantly appointed, extremely well managed, and the rooms are unbelievably spacious - even larger that many American hotel rooms, and much more richly appointed. The bathrooms are large also, and we would always request the rooms with full bathtubs, which are luxurious! Then, there is the special location of the Hotel Canada. While it is not directly located right among a particular tourist attraction in Rome, such as the Spanish Steps or Trevi fountain, the beauty of the Hotel Canada is that it is just steps away from the Castro Pretoria metro subway stop, which can whisk you away to all the sights of Rome..... and which are all in different locations throughout the city. Traveling to the Colliseum is a breeze on the metro going in one direction from the Hotel Canada. Then traveling to the Spanish Steps area and the Pantheon and Piazza Navone on the metro going in the other direction is just as quick and easy. Then, you can also travel all the way to the Vatican by just taking the same metro stop, Castro Pretoria, which is just beside the Hotel Canada. In addition, the Hotel is an easy five block walk to Rome's main Termini station, where you can easily ride south to Naples and Pompeii, or enjoy all the conveniences of the shopping mall at Termini, as well as it's excellent cafeterias and fast food options, if you like. We even rode the subway line to the outskirts of Rome to the stop closest to the Appian Way and the Baths of Caracula, which are all encompassed in a green, rural-like national park area ( we easily caught a cab ride from the metro to the Baths and Park area, walked alongside the entrances to the Catacombs and saw the old Roman gates and walls). The beautiful park setting with trees and green lawn vistas of the Baths and the Appian Way should not be missed, even by first time visitors, because it presents such a lovely side of Rome. The Hotel Canada is just a perfect location for visitors that want easy access to all the sites while staying in a beautiful, well-managed hotel, as opposed to being located close to one particular site. (And we are the kind of tourists that like to be right in the heart of the cities we visit - so this tells you how special the Hotel Canada is.... and how Rome has so many hearts to see!) During this trip in March 2011, we brought my parents, who have some mobility issues due to knee problems. We were able to get everywhere easily using a combination of the subway, cabs, and limited walking (actually, a good deal of walking at the Vatican!). We all were made to feel so comfortable by the friendly owners and staff at the Hotel Canada. They answered my Dad's many questions with great enthusiasm and patience. This kind of friendliness and graciousness was invaluable to me, as I wanted my parents to enjoy their trip. The breakfast buffet is wonderful and I imagine one of the best in Rome, with it's offerings of American style scrambled and hard boiled eggs, bacon and sausages, as well as the more continental items such as cold meats, cheeses, fresh baked breads and pastries, yogurt and even bottled Limonettas, a nice treat. Having such a nice, quiet breakfast in a lovely appointed room with high ceilings in the heart of bustling Rome is a great start to a day of visiting sights. Rome has so much to offer that it can be overwhelming, but having the Canada Hotel as your base, you have a comfortable, friendly place to retreat to in the evenings. Even the host at the hotel bar is about as a friendly a gentleman as you will meet - and he even sets up a complimentary appetizer table during the happy hour evening time. (Also, the bar prices were so much better at the Canada, we found ourselves returning here every night for a pleasant winding down of the day) We stayed five nights this time, and even discovered a wonderful family-run restaurant a block from the hotel that offers excellent, inexpensive meals and even gelato well into the late evening - a great convenience after a full day!. All in all, we have the best praise possible for the Hotel Canada and it's splendid staff - it offers a way to see the best that Rome offers with none of the standard big city hassles and hustle bustle!

The staff were notably pleasant and helpful. The room was comfortable - tiled floors which seem cooling, a bit old fashioned in a way I like. WiFi is free and fast, but you have to ask for a password. The old fashioned lift does become paralyzed if guests omit to close both sets of doors. It's a bit quirky and not typical of North American chains, but I liked it more as a result. Best Western do seem to allow their hotels some individualism, much less corporate than the other chains. There are negative comments about the area in some of the reviews, but actually it is convenient. You can walk to Termini station in 10 minutes and that is the main transport hub for the city of Rome. While food tends to be expensive in Rome, transport is exceptionally cheap - you won't spend more than \u20ac4 a day as that is the price of the all-day ticket for buses and metro. The area round Termini is much as you might expect in a station area, but those who think the area unsafe must be remarkably easily scared. The walk to the hotel goes through multiple pavement restaurants all open and occupied until late - it is perfectly safe.

When my husband told me it was very close to the train station I was a bit skeptical. Boy, was I wrong. This hotel exceeded all our expectations and then some. The room we were given was spotless and incredibly comfortable. It was quite a large room with a small sitting room attached. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were of very good quality. The bathroom even had a retractable clothes line available. There was even a small balcony leading off into a small courtyard below. The room was tastefully decorated with antique furnishings and beautiful artwork. The room itself was very quiet and I slept incredibly well. The breakfast was fantastic! A huge variety of different foods were available and there was some variety day to day. One day it was salmon, another day it was different variety of cheeses, etc. The main woman who worked tirelessly bringing coffees to all the tables always had a smile on her face. Every evening a variety of nibbles was put out in the bar area. Even if you did not partake in a drink you were welcomed to try the various nuts, olives, pastries, etc. We did ask advice on a good restaurant in the area and we were given the name of Trattoria Leoni D'Abruzzo which was just down the street from the hotel. This restaurant proved to be very disappointing. My husband and myself had the lasagna and it was horrible. My husband kept telling me that the lasagna I make is a hundred times better.

My husband and I decided on this hotel after searching for two whole weeks on numerous websites. It is close to Termini Station like advertised however not close to any tourist sites. Lots of food options which are all good. The staff are not at all friendly towards Americans, they tolerate you. We didn't get any sort of advice or recommendations. We weren't even told our room had a safe, I had to inquire after I couldn't find it in the room. You don't have ready access to an iron if you need one, you must request daily. The sheets are not changed daily unless you ask, i was told it depends on the maid working that day. BEDS ARE HARD LIKE ROCKS! Don't stay here if you want a soft or medium bed. The food felt like \"GroundHog Day\", i.e. same thing everyday, nothing great, undercooked bacon mixed with vienna sausages.Boiled eggs are not thoroughly boiled, so watch out. The fruit is not the best selection. The pastries were way better if you want to eat this daily. The cappucino and coffee are truly awesone. Again, the staff look like they are overworked and just plain tired of the tourists coming from all over. We did alot of walking. Used the laundry service of a local just around the corner, it costs us approx 8 Euro for one load, picked up the next day. Next time will stay closer i.e. Central Rome since this is where we went everyday, used the Roma Pass which is the way to go in order to see the Coliseum and Roman Forum and get train access for three days, costs 25 Euro per person. The biggest tip of all: The airport does not provide shuttle service at all. Don't use taxi either since it is a major ripoff. Go to www.airportshuttle.it Make reservations online, it costs 25 Euro for one person one way, each additional person is 6 Euro. They will wait up to 90 minutes for you at the airport waiting for you to come in. This is an honest company and the staff are reliable. We used it to get from hotel to airport and there were many others on shuttle from other hotels. Will definitely use next time. Lesson learned. The reviews are coming from people who have certain expectations or have accepted a certain standard. You are getting what you pay for and in Rome, your money does not go a long way. We payed approx $182 a night for this place and our way back to the U.S. we stayed at a Hyatt for one night in California and only payed $130/nt. There was no comparison. Don't expect anything anywhere near what you may get for the price in a U.S. Hotel. It would have been nice to have a mini fridge so at least we could have a cold drink waiting for us. Our room didn't have one. There are several little markets around which sell drinks for for 1/4th of what you will pay at a site or restaurant.

Besides being reasonably priced, the staff also went out of their way to assist us with what we needed. As an example, when we arrived at about 11h00, our room was ready and we could unpack and freshen up. On top of that, the front desk staff and the barman were very attentive and always made us feel at home. As mentioned before, the bar prices are almost ridicilously low in comparison to other places in the city and there were proper snacks in the early evening. The room we stayed in was comfortably big and the bathroom was adequate. Kept very clean every day. My only issue here would be the very small bath in which we had to stand when showering, I had to do a kind of balancing act not to fall down. Breakfast was great, although the freah fruits were a bit on the scarce side. Like normal, we tried eating a bit of everything the first morning, but we fortunately cut down the next two days. We never left hungry. We used the Metro, there is a stop literally within 100 meters from the hotel, to get us to most places, so the location did not really impact on us.

We had two rooms, both of which were quite sizeable. We really enjoyed our stay. The staff were friendly, and check in was a breeze. Nothing was too much trouble for anyone, and reception were happy to print off pre-booked tickets for us etc if we emailed them down to the main office (free wi-fi was on offer, which was great). I also heard them booking Opera tickets for another couple and giving helpful advice about directions to an out of town site. I was initially concerned as the hotel was on a corner of a main road, but we were undisturbed by traffic noise in the night with the windows closed and aircon on. The bed was extraordinarily comfortable, and the shower was powerful and hot. The room was spotlessly clean, and the bathrom was very good quality. Breakfast was served until 10 am and was pretty busy at times. There was a good continental spread,. and a hot buffet of eggs, bacon etc (not cooked to order). Everyone mentions the bar, and how reasonable it is...it's so true! We were expecting hiked prices for Rome, but I don't think I have enjoyed a glass (or half bottle!) of decent wine in a city establishment cheaper than this anywhere in the world! Coupled with the canapes on offer, this was such a nice treat to come back to after a hot day out. OK, this hotel is not in the absolute centre of Rome, but it's so easy to get anywhere from here. You can either walk to the main station -Termini (10 mins, turning right out of the hotel), or there is a closer Metro station (Castro Pretorio) about 200 metres round the corner (turn left and left again). At the end of the road (by the Termini) you can also pick up one of the many types of \"Hop On Hop Off\" buses, and there is also a bus stop for a bus going back to the airports. The Metro starts at 5.30 am, and you can get anywhere for 1 euro (single journey) so long as your route doesn't take more than 75 minutes. It's so easy to use as there are only 2 lines. Top Tips: Pre Book every entrance ticket that you can...it's slightly more expensive, but the Colisseum and Vatican queues are worth avoiding at all costs, particularly on a hot day. We walked straight to the front, and saved ourselves a good hour at least. If you are an early riser, then hop on the Metro and go and see the sun rise over St Peter's Basilica..quite stunning..I had it almost to myself for a while...It opens early too, so you could beat the crowds to get in. A walk to the Spanish steps via the Pantheon at that time of the morning is a joy. Watch the artists setting up in Piazza Navona, have an early Capuccino in one of the back street cafes, and see Rome slowly wake up..

Hotel Canada proved to be an outstanding choice, and I would add that the property deserves at least a four star rating rather than its designated three stars. Although some travelers may hesitate booking this hotel because of its location, I would counter that although it is not in the middle of the most popular tourist areas, it nevertheless is located on a quiet street very close to the Castro-Pretorio metro stop, as well as the main rail/subway station. Bus service is also readily available in front of the Termini. Moreover, there are a number of excellent, non-touristy restaurants in the peripheral area. We found the hotel to be meticulously clean and well maintained with a friendly, professional and efficient staff. We enjoyed a large double room with a queen bed that was very comfortable. The room was nicely decorated and large by European standards, allowing for a great deal of maneuverability. The bathroom, although not overly large, was nevertheless efficient with an excellent selection of amenities that are not normally included at most three star hotels (i.e., toothbrushes, slippers, q-tips, etc.). An electronic safe is set inside a wall; there is a flat screen TV, and ample closet/drawer space. Housekeeping was always completed in a timely manner. Finally, having an air conditioned room was a great benefit given the warm temperatures in Rome during our stay. We have traveled throughout Europe and without exception, the included buffet breakfast is one of the best we experienced. The quality, selection, variety and presentation are simply outstanding. Wait staff were very friendly, professional and efficient. This is an excellent and impressive hotel that is very easy to recommend to anyone visiting Rome.

At night, there were plenty of couples and families walking around. Our dining experiences near the hotel were better than what we experienced in the center of Rome as well.

As far as the hotel, our room was very clean and our bed was a comfortable queen sized bed. However, our shower was very small. It was hard to stand up in the tub because it was so narrow that you had to somewhat align your feet against the side of the tub (if that makes sense). Also, the walls must be very thin because we were frequently awakened at 7 AM by people in the hallway talking and slamming doors (and we are NOT light sleepers).

There are two slight negatives which should be covered first before getting on to the many many positives about this hotel. Firstly was the lack of electric sockets; there were only two available which were at skirting board level meaning to get to them you had to climb over a bedside table or an armchair. Secondly is the location which is a bit out of the way - however in some ways this is actually a positive as it meant when you returned to the hotel you were leaving the crowds of central Rome behind! Although the hotel is not in the heart of Rome, it is just around the corner from the Castro Pretoria metro stop or a ten minute walk to the Termini both giving easy access to the rest of Rome by either metro or bus! The hotel seems to have thought of almost every detail and nothing was too much trouble, starting with a lovely and welcoming reception area, comfortable bar and lounge area with loads of books to borrow. All of the staff were friendly and really helpful but special mention should be given to Vincenzo on reception and bartender Edwin; who was a real joy! Our room was lovely and really tastefully decorated with (what looked like) antique furniture, cd player and radio, built in safe and one of the most comfortable beds I've ever had in a hotel. Our room included a separate seating area with a desk making us feel like we had a suite! The bed linens were clean and the housekeeping staff kept everything spotless. We also had a large bathroom with all the usual shampoos etc and a pair of terry slippers! Although there was no tea or coffee facilities in the room, after requesting some with reception they delivered a \"kit\" to our room with a kettle within minutes. This was when we first discovered the lack of sockets. Considering the hotel has given so much thought to the details of the room, even installing built in nightlights which you can switch on from your bedside so that you don't disturb a sleeping partner if you need to get up in the night this seems a small detail they missed! Our room overlooked the central courtyard making it very quiet, although we missed the views we did get a balcony and were able to sleep with our windows open. We were celebrating a birthday in Rome and found a bottle of Moet and strawberries waiting on our arrival. We didn't drink the champagne till our last evening and left a note for housekeeping in bad Italian that morning asking if we could have the ice bucket filled and on our return that evening had a lovely bottle of nicely chilled champagne. I'm not sure you'd get that service in most 3 star hotels! A highlight of each day was the lovely (free) buffet breakfast. Angela and Massimo looked after things really well and went above and beyond each day to make certain we had everything we needed or wanted. Massimo would bring our usual cafe con latte without us even requesting it. The buffet was beautifully decorated and all foods were appetizing and included cereals, fruit, yogurts, meats, fish, cheeses, varieties of rolls and pastries, juice, and bread and jams etc. The hotel has WiFi, which you need to get a code for from Reception, but there is also a free computer to use in reception. One thing we thought was lacking was a printer but we were able to email our Boarding Passes to reception who delivered them to our room. Coming back to the hotel after a hard day sightseeing was a joy, making use of the free nibbles in the bar with a drink. The bar is the cheapest I've ever known in a hotel; a cafe con latte, espresso and a very generous limoncello was \u20ac5,00 - and to be served by Edwin was a real joy! Talking of dinner, although there is no restaurant in the hotel, the staff on reception were more than happy to make recommendations or reservations. There is a choice of restaurants in the area, we did eat at one of the recommendations on the first night but for the rest of our trip ventured back into central Rome each evening for dinner before having a leisurely walk back to the hotel (about 30 minutes) for a cafe and limoncello before bed!

Location of Hotel is good since it's near Metro station just one stop from Termini at the same time it's far from the crowd. Breakfast quality and variety was good however breakfast room was a little bit small and at the peak time you should wait for a free table. The main problem of this hotel is the lift. It has two different doors which should be both closed other wise the lift does not move. Many hotel clients does not know this a leave the inner doors open. So this force you come down or up by the staircase which is not so easy when you tired. My son left his mobile at the lobby but when we contacted the hotel from Sorrento it never found. However we can not blame anybody in the hotel for that.

The hotel is well decorated, perhaps slightly over the top in places, and trying to be what it is not, but I would not say that this hotel is looking shabby. The room, which had a sizeable double bed, was reasonable. I have had bigger, but I have also had smaller hotel rooms. The bathroom was looking slightly tired. The tiles had been re-grouted rather than replaced but everything was in good order and clean. That is one thing I cannot fault - the cleaning and room service has been exemplary for a hotel of this star rating. However, if there is one area that the hotel needs to work on it is possibly its staffing ratios - I have had a bar man who was also concierge and baggage boy and therefore I have noticed he was not always in position - say if you wanted a drink at the bar. For visiting Rome, this was a good choice and I would recommend it. Will I stay somewhere else next time? Probably. That is not out of dislike for the hotel but for now that I know the layout of Rome I would go for a hotel around some of the key piazzas. This will suit most.

From there you can walk north and visit just about every other main attraction without too much effort. It's worth getting the 4 Euro day transport ticket and then just jump on and off the numerous buses.

The bathroom was nice-sized, and there was a full tub. The breakfast was very excellent, and included fresh-baked pies and cakes in addition to outstanding bread and cheese (and more --- there was quite a bit of selection). Service was friendly, and the hotel lobby has a bar with reasonably priced drinks! The price of the room, while higher than the other hotels I was looking at, was reasonable for Rome.

Also, I couldn't print my boarding passes from the lobby computer without emailing them to the front desk and then they couldn't open them to print.

The customer service was very good both before we got there and while we were there.

When it comes to the whingeing about having to walk long distances from the hotel they must be plain lazy, the sites such as the Colosseum, Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain are about 10 - 15 minutes stroll away. We also walked to the Vatican which probably took an hour as we strolled and enjoyed the scenery on the way, with such history around every corner why would you want to rush to the more famous locations. I guess some people just want to go and tick the boxes of having 'done Rome'! Back to the hotel, we stayed there for three nights in late March and from the moment we arrived we loved it. They don't have a restaurant but there are plenty of little places nearby and at the bar they put out snacks, which they keep replenishing during the evening. The breakfast was superb, from eggs and bacon to large cakes, there was something for everyone. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. I have seen comments about them being otherwise, which makes me wonder how the people that found them that way treated them to begin with.

Large for European standards with an updated bathroom with shower/tub. There is free high speed internet, just ask for your login at the front desk. Breakfast is wonderful with a large selection of fresh fruit, pasteries, toast, ceral, scrambled eggs, bacon, coffee and juice. They have a small and slow old fashioned elevator that does the trick and adds to the old world charm of the hotel. There is a laundromat just as you exit the hotel, turn right, then go left at the first street. They offer self use washers/dryers for 11 Euros per load, but for the same price you can drop off your laundry and they will do it for you :) Lots of restaurants, osteria, pizzeria's in the area. We felt very safe walking around the area. As a bonus, I cashed in my Air Miles reward points for BW Gift Cards and saved $600 CDN on the price. Just be sure to present your BW gift cards shortly after you check in. They will then deduct it from the total bill and show you the balance to be paid on check out.

The first thing we noticed was the huge size of the room and the bathroom compared to the other hotels we have stayed in in Europe. there were huge cupboards/storage spaces also, and the bathrooms were provided with lots of towels and bath accessories. The room had nice wallpaper, and a huge safe, but no mini-bar. The reception staff was helpful, and gave good guidance on how to visit various places, and provided maps of the city. The location is also a big plus because from Termini you can get to anywhere in town, and the bus ticket is only 1 Euro.

On the irritants--the small lift had a mind of it's own,and often would not stop on your floor when you called for it--everyday we could see people getting fed up of waiting for it as it went up and down past their floor, finally walking up and down the (thankfully) wide stairs in defeat. The air conditioning was set to a specific temparature, so it was pretty uncomfortable for a while when one got back in the summer afternoon from a day in the sun.The tv was small, and too far away from the bed in such a big room.

We stayed here on two visits, one initially when we flew into Rome late April and on a return trip in May the night before we went home. The reviews are correct, this place is top notch. The hotel is located in a spot you can walk pretty much wherever you want, or take the metro only blocks away at the Termini. Also convenient is the Bancomat around the corner for getting your money. It is abit on the pricey side, but it was worth it for our initial and return trips when we were the most in need of comfort. The rooms are well appointed and on our first stay we had an inside room that was perfect. We traveled with two other couples and though we all had spacious, clean rooms with plenty of windows, two of the rooms faced the street and the noise made sleep difficult. They have double paned windows for noise, but it seems they do not use the air conditioning until summer so the rooms can get hot and stuffy with the windows closed. On the second stay, the hotel tried hard to get us inside rooms, but they were not available. They did place us in beautiful rooms facing a side street that was less noisy. This helped, but it's still worth requesting an inside room if you can \u2013 room 404 is awesome. If you\u2019re tolerant of night noise or heat, no problem though. The beds were incredibly comfortable and the amenities were pretty decent (shampoo, toothbrush, lotion, etc.) They had a music player that was a nice feature, and, of course, a TV. The service was excellent and the staff was very helpful and accommodating. There is a computer in the lobby for quick email or google searches. Ask for a password at the desk, but don\u2019t lose it! They would not give me another one when I misplaced mine. As others have mentioned, the breakfast was exceptional with fresh eggs (scrambled, quiches, and hard boiled), good quality cold cuts, fresh bread and fruit, cereal, etc. and you can order specialty coffees too! It definitely held us until dinner. There is also an afternoon happy hour with snacks -- not a meal -- but great with drinks. The drink prices were cheap during the happy hour, so we were very \"happy\" when we ventured out into the city at night. The hotel recommended a restaurant nearby that was just ok and a little pretentious (when we asked for tap water the waiter said they didn\u2019t have it and brought us several bottles of water instead; we had no problem at other restaurants asking for and getting tap water). One of the couples in our party liked the restaurant quite abit so it may have just been our meal. You\u2019d be best to use tripadvisor to find your dining. That\u2019s what we mostly did. All of the ones we researched on tripadvisor were awesome.

As stated in other reviews, Hotel Canada is a 10 minute walk from the train station (get the google map directions before going). I finally realized that most of the major sites are a short distance from one of the two metro lines (A, red, and B, blue). A metro station is just around the corner from Hotel Canada (check out the metro layout). The metro has lots of graffiti but don't let that worry you. It's safe with lots of people around. So one euro gets you to the front of the colleseum, or close to Trevi fountain, or Spanish steps, vatican city, circus maximus etc. This hotel is a ways from the central sites but no one hotel is going to get you close to all sites. Use the metro. The hotel rooms are nicely decorated and well maintained. Furnishings are updated, TV gets CNN and BBC, bath is large and accomodating.

While I listed this trip as leisure, there was a bit of business at the end and there was one night into the business portion that my wife stayed with me. Since the rate was a bit higher for her than for me alone, I was no sure how to handle the reimbursable portion of the receipt. I mentioned this to Giovanni at the counter during my stay and he came up with a great idea that resulted in two receipts that divided personal and business charges perfectly between them. He took quite a bit of his time to do this but it made filing my reimbursement claim much easier. The only issue that could have been a problem was that there are a lot of college students in that part of Rome and they seem to like to stay out very late sitting at the sidewalk restaurants and being pretty loud (like college students everywhere). My room was right over one of the restaurants and I was, the first evening, wondering if I was going to be able to sleep. Then I closed the windows and...no noise! I don't know how the windows are constructed but they blocked out noise almost entirely. There were several excellent and (for a major city) reasonable restaurants (Leoni d'Abruzzo was our favorite), either on the same block or a block or two away, a great little grocery, and some other shops all within a minute or two walk. I could go on with what I liked about this place but it would take a magazine article to cover it all. Bottom line...if you don't feel you have to be in the ritiziest part of the city and just want a great hotel in a location next door to a Metro stop, a quick walk to the train station, and a 30 minute walk to the Colosseum and other historical stuff...this place is it.", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cQuaint and Convenient\u201d", "Author": "JustbeCoz", "ReviewID": "UR62304396", "Content": "Travelling with two families each with children makes it difficult in Europe sometimes in finding rooms that accomodate.

Having always relied on Tripadvisor ratings on my previous travels I felt confident to rely on the reviews that put this hotel amongst the top 20 of almost 1500 in Rome. We were not disappointed as the hotel far exceeded our expectations. To begin the taxi for 4 plus luggage came to 53 Euros from Fumicino, this exceeded the standard 40 euro charge as the driver explained that the hotel sat a short distance outside of the boundary. The hotel staff confirmed that 53 Euros was about right. If you prefer to take the train then there is a direct link from the airport to Termini station which is a couple of hundred yards up the road. The hotel is an ideal base for a sightseeing trip. Termini offers you buses, trams, taxis, open top bus tours and the metro which give you a wide choice of options dependent on your destination. For the Coliseum, Vatican, Spanish Steps and Trevi fountain we found the metro to be the best bet at 1 euro for a one way trip. Most taxis from the main sights cost us about 10-15 euro when we were feeling lazy! The hotel itself is a very high standard 3 star. It has clearly been recently refurbed and was exceptionally clean and beautifully decorated. The antiquated lift struggles with any more than 3 people and when you are on the fifth floor and there are 70 rooms it did mean that there was either a long wait to get all 4 of us up to the room or more strain on the already over worked legs! The bedrooms were very comfortable with an LCD TV and wall mounted CD player. The player is compatible with MP3 but not iPod or iPhone. The toiletries that are provided were extensive and of a very good quality. We did find the hotel a little noisy in the morning but that was mainly due to inconsiderate guests than anything the hotel could be blamed for. We didn't get any traffic noise or such like as the hotel sits amongst a group of others in a relatively quiet side street. Take a look at the reviews for the Best Western Villafranca which is directly opposite if you want to see a stark difference in what the same hotel chain can achieve!!! The staff were wonderfully friendly and extremely helpful; the hotel did have an intimate B&B type atmosphere. I would wholly recommend that you make full use of the bar facility at the hotel it was only 2 euro for a bottle of Peroni, 4.50 euro for a spirit and mixer and 6 euro for a bottle of wine. Elsewhere in the city you will pay at least double if not triple for the same, so a few drinks before you hit the town makes great economical sense. A table of complimentary bar snacks is also most welcome to help while away the hours it took for the other half to get ready!!! We ate lunch a few times around the hotel area whilst we were there, there is a wide choice of restaurants and the food was always good value and of a very satisfactory standard. If you are looking for a pleasant, intimate hotel with helpful and friendly staff that is ideally located a short distance from the hustle and bustle of Rome yet with excellent transport links then the Hotel Canada is a perfect choice for you.

Firstly thanks for all previous tripadvisor reviewers for the recomendation, once again a little research has paid dividends. Location- Best Western Hotel Canada (BWHC) is located on a side street in a less fashionable area of the city but is near to the metro, mainline train and bus station and an ideal venue to tour the sights of rome. Nearby there are a number of bars and restaurants we tried a couple of them out and all served good local food. From the road the BWHC is not imposing but the reception area which doubles as the bar is clean and stylish which probably sums the place up to a tee. We used the location to good effect using a combination of taxis, bus, tube and walking to get about. From the airport (Rome international) a taxi for four with luggage cost us 53 Euros, nearby there is a red bus which enables 48 hours travel through the day to major tourist destinations and you can hop on and off (18 euro). Local tubes and busses work out at about 1 euro per adult per journey for 75 mins worth of travel. All ways were effective although walking most enjoyable. The rooms- our party had two double rooms on the fifth floor, access to which is via a quaint lift. The lift holds three people so the two ladies used it for our stay and consigned the guys to the stairs! The rooms themselves again was stylish, ours had a large bathroom with bidet, whilst our friends had a shower instead of the bath. The bedroom was large and stylish, the bed big and comfortable with a tv and radio/cd player. We didn't have a view as our room was at the back of the hotel and there were no luxuries like mini bars etc although tea/coffee & ironing facilities are available on request. In essence our room was clean stylish and functional but not luxurious, we weren't dissapointed. All the staff but particularly the reception staff were very helpful, friendly and spoke good English all had a smile and were eager to accomodate. Food wise- the breakfast was pretty good with a variety of food available. It was always tasty and the staff pleasant and accomodating. Bigger hotels may have more on offer but the BWHC has the friendly intimate service that larger places could not compete with. The bar was cheap with a beer at 2 euros and a bottle of wine at 6 euros, many other places were 3 times as expensive. In the reception area there is also free internet access. On the whole we enjoyed an amazing trip to Rome, which is an incredible city an beyond the hype.This was in part thanks to the Best Western Hotel Canada and it's staff. Thankyou.

I was so paranoid I\u2019d had got it wrong that I checked with my wife. Thank God she confirmed my views, that they were shocking. I do agree though that most of the staff bar the front desk staff (Giancarlo specifically) were great. As for Giancarlo, in all the 7 Hotels that we stayed at on our European trip he was the most unhelpful we met. Every time you asked him a question it was if you were disturbing him, to be honest the only thing we ever disturbed him from doing was reading the paper. Anyway enough about these guys, we stayed 5 nights and the Hotel itself was great, clean, good sized rooms, great d\u00e9cor, big bathrooms, handy location(5 min walk to Termini Station and local bus terminus). Great breakfast with lots of variety. Great Pizza place, next block down on the corner that serves pizza by weight(cheap) and has many and varied pizza\u2019s. Rome is ideal to walk around; we even did it in 35 degree celsius heat every day. However if it gets tiresome and you need some relief the buses are great and will always bring you back to the hotel, as a I said great location to base yourself. We never once used the Metro as the buses were so good. There are so many sites in Rome to visit and most of the \u201cpay to get in\u201d sites have long queues, the trick for all of them is to get there early. Everyone carries on about the long line at St Paul\u2019s, well I can tell you we were there just after 9am and we walked straight in, and when we came out the line was hundreds of metres long, but that was at 10:30. Even the Vatican museum, where we were duped and paid the premium entry fee so we could avoid the long queue, when we rolled up with our express entry group there was no one waiting, we could have just bought our entry ticket and walked in. They dupe you because you can\u2019t see the entrance from the St. Peters square and everyone leads you to believe that the lines will be long, just like St Peters Basilica, but they are NOT!! Even when we came out of the Vatican Museum there were no lines. The Vatican museum you can take it or leave it but this is the only way you are going to see the Sistine Chapel, oh yeah while you are in there DON\u2019T listen to the recorded messages telling you not to take photos and video, everyone is doing it. The security treat catching people doing it as a game with no ramifications. I had a security guy put a laser on me while I was filming and when I reliased what was happening and looked at him he was laughing. Take that photo, cause it is priceless. Also went to the Coloseum and we arrived just before lunch (didn\u2019t get there early for this one) as we visited a number of sites before getting to the Coloseum, and the queue was horrendous, ended up paying for a guided tour which allowed us to jump the queue. There are many English speaking people selling the guided tours outside, they are fairly cheap, just $8euro extra, well worth it. This also included a guided tour of the Roman Forum. At the Roman Forum the guide then tries to sell you all the other tours that they do, specifically the catacombs. Don\u2019t take them they are a rip off. We did the San Callisto Catacombs ourselves, we went there by local bus, caught the bus from the bus terminus near the hotel, drops you off right at the catacombs and when you go in and pay the entry it includes a guided tour of the catacombs. After the tour you can then walk around the grounds yourself. Google the San Callisto catacombs for details of what is there. From a family cost perspective it saved us over $200Euro, quite significant. For the Aussies, the priest who does the English speaking tours is from Melbourne, father Owen from Boxhill. Please note we were in Rome at peak season so all this advice is at the busiest time of the year for tourists. It is worthwhile noting that Rome is also very safe; we travelled around at night by foot and never felt concerned about our safety. They are your usual unsavory type in the city but were never harassed. Some Tips: Beware the piazza\u2019s, everything is quadruple the price to seat outside and watch the world go past. Look for the out of the way places and you will find a bargain and even a character or two. We walked out of a caf\u00e9 at the Piazza Navona after I realised they were charging, $5.50 for a short black coffee, $7 for a coke and $6 for a small bottle of water\u2026yes Euro. We found a nice small caf\u00e9/ice creamery and sat outside (had the best ice cream in Italy) . Don\u2019t waste your money on the hop off hop on bus in Rome; everything in the city is within easy walking distance. Hop on Hop off is worth it for Paris (big city) definitely not for Rome. If you get a taxi from or to the airport from Rome itself they can NOT charge you anymore than $40Euro and that applies to even Taxi\u2019s that you book from your Hotel. If you get into an argument tell the driver you want to call the Tourist Police, this will end the argument. The great front desk staff wanted to charge us $55Euro for this privilege, not a bad $15Euro tip for doing nothing; we booked our own and paid the $40Euro. Do NOT bring TRAVELLERS Cheques to Rome, no one will honour them and to cash them they want 12% commission\u2026.rip off. Best way is to use credit card or do ATM withdrawals. You can drink the water from the many fountains; the fountain at the bottom of the Spanish steps has the coldest and most refreshing water.

The lobby and rooms were beautifully decorated and very comfortable & clean.

The breakfast was just as described in other reviews - it was delicious and there was something for everyone. The little bar area was a real treat, with a sumptuous array of meats, cheeses, nuts, olives and other snacks set out each evening. Buying a bottle of wine and spending time there was the perfect way to end each of our evenings in Rome. The true highlight of the Hotel Canada, though, was its staff. They couldn't have been kinder or more accommodating. Special mention must be made of Massimo, who oversees the bar area on many evenings. His winning smile and delightful personality made our stay very special - not to mention his gift for making beautiful hors d'oeuvres! The location of the Hotel Canada is excellent - within walking distance of Termini station (coming from the trains, exit the building on the right side and you're on Via Marsala & Via Marghera; walk one block up to Via Vicenza and then it's just about 5 blocks to the hotel). The Castro Pretorio metro stop is right around the corner from the hotel, so it's easy to get around. But we liked walking around Rome - there's something beautiful and interesting at every turn!

We picked this hotel based on the wonderful reviews on Trip Advisor. This hotel will not disappoint. It delivers. Spacious rooms, friendly, helpful staff and superb buffet breakfast. It's location is a stiff, but direct 10 minute walk to the crazy, busy Termini station. Our room, a junior suite , room 214, would have been better suited to a couple with a small child, as it had a day bed in the small anti-room which flowed into the main bedroom, containing a queen sized bed, armoir, HD TV, but no chest of drawers, no night tables to speak of. We did have a balcony, which overlooked a courtyard, which ended up being a waste as it poured the whole time we were there. Nicely appointed bathroon, with tub. Upscale toiletries. The bird cage mini elevator was an interesting experience. It worked well and got us to the lobby and room. Technically, the hotel does not have a restaurant but does serve a wonderful, very full breakfast buffet which is an absolute highlight. A beautiful Senora, Dragica, from Slovenia, and her staff put out an amazing spread each day that contained dozens and dozens of items including prosciutto, soppresata salami, nice selection of cheeses, wonderful eggs, bacon, ham, terrific quiches, many varieties of fruit , large selection of breads and pastries including a fabulous Napolean Loaf and other selected pies and cakes. The italians must love their desserts/pastries in the morning! Great Cappucino, Cafe Latte. We have never seen a breakfast spread this diverse, and so good, not even at the major US hotels.Note; our friends could not get a reservation at this hotel, and ended up staying at another BW property, Hotel Art Deco. On the last morning in Rome we went to pick them up with our limo and I went inside to get them. While waiting I walked into this hotel's breakfast room and was surprised at how minimal and bland the breakfast buffet looked. HotelCanada also puts out a mini spread of snacks at the bar from 5 pm to 10 pm, which varies each evening which included parmesan cheese chunks, salami chunks, several types of nuts including pistachios as well as chips, little cakes, etc. . Adjacent to the bar is a computer, free of use for guests who are provided with a password for their stay. Note:For this they require a copy of your passport. During our three days we used Viator's Green Line HopON and HopOff buses which were horrible . The buses were generally dirty, had numerous broken tape machines so that you had to really hunt for a seat that would give you a working tap ( tour guide info). On one of the buses, the driver actually hit a parked car and laughed about it to the ticket taker and drove away. On other buses, the ticket person couldn't be bothered to announce the various stops. Avoid this bus line which is located across from the Termini, not in the Termini station area. Generally the taped tour is very minimal and we found that we often passed by what looked like major monuments, with no commentary from the tape. Also avoid the restaurant Da Vicenzo on Via Castelfidardo. One of our friends made the mistake to ask for some antipasto for our group of six and out came 10 plates of cold fish appetizers, which were not good. We got charged 70 Euros ( well over $110 US) just for these appetizers, and the entrees which also ended up being expensive were very mediocre. Avoid this restaurant. If you want to go on a Vatican Tour (Sisteen Chapel) prebook online before you go as it is only 14 Euros ( instead of 34 Euros if you wait to buy the tix on-site. Your prepurchased tickets allow you to bypass the enormous long line of people waiting to buy tickets. While you walk past this line, you go in a door just to the right of where everyone else goes in. Beware that the tSisteen Chapel tour is actually 55 different rooms filled with art/statues and takes a good one and one-half hours before you actually see the Sisteen Chapel. Altogether figure on a good three hours at least to see the chapel and St. Peter's church", "Date": "November 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales, UK", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel\u201d", "Author": "LucyWales_UK", "ReviewID": "UR48736554", "Content": "Stayed here at easter time on a short braek to Rome and absolutely loved it.

The hotel is quiet and well maintained - efficiently run. Rooms are quite large and traditionally furnished and our bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever slept in. The shower was superb - masses of hot water - lovely. Breakfast was super - as much as you can eat and a great variety of cold food as well as scrambled eggs and bacon. Coffee and tea freely available - cappucino on request. People quite frequently needed to queue for a table but didn't notice anyone queueing for longer than 5 minutes. Tried some of the local restaurants in the same street but they were, at best, mediocre. 'Seasonal fruit' dessert at one consisted of a pear and a knife on a plate - 3 Euros - you have to laugh - and then make sure you don't return! We would wholeheartedly recommend the restaurant 'Il Cuore di Napoli' on Via Cernia 31, a ten - fifteen minute walk north-west of the hotel and recommended in the Eyewitness Travel Guides. Tourists were vastly outnumbered by Italians, which has to be a good sign, although menus were available in English and some staff were English speaking. We ate here twice - once choosing from the menu and the second time from their Halloween special menu. Steak and seafood were out of this world but there were a wide selection of pizzas available for the less adventurous. We walked a lot during our six day stay in Rome and got around using the Metro with no problem. We wanted to visit the gardens at Tivoli and managed that by using the Metro from Castro Pretoria to Ponte Mammolo then catching a local bus to Tivoli. The guide books recommended a visit to Ostia Antica which we managed by catching the Metro to Piramide then a local train to Ostia Antica railway station. This is an amazing place - not as dramatic as Pompeii but just as extensive. Language isn't a problem as most Italians speak at least a smattering of English, but it doesn't take a lot of effort to learn just a few words of Italian - at least enough to ask for a railway ticket and order a cup of coffees. The Metro tickets are 1 Euro flat rate to anywhere on the system. Take as much care with your wallets, purses, bags etc on the Rome Metro as you would on any tube / Metro system. The bus and local train fares were two Euros each way so there is no need to waste money on taxi fares in order to do your sightseeing and we found the bus drivers and fellow passengers helpful when help was needed.

The gentlemen (they were grown-up men, not the kids you find in some hotels) who manned the front desk were very professional and helpful. The room (420) was so very nice. Painted ceiling, comfortable bed, comfortable pillows and quality linens. Nice sized wardrobe for clothes storage. FREE internet- just ask for a code after check-in. There was a safe, hidden behind a wall picture. The bathroom was quite large and had a nice window. There was a shower curtain in the tub/shower combo rather than the commonly found glass half door and a retractable clothes line over tub. Upscale personal care amenities. Washcloths are available upon request at front desk. Breakfast was very good. Selection is better early on (for example- there was smoked salmon at 7am but not at 9:30am). We found the hotel ideally situated. We were arriving by train and departing by air, so being close to Termini (about 3 or 4 blocks from hotel) was great. Both subway lines are at Termini and a one-line stop is even closer, 1/2 block away. Also, Termini is a great place to pick up the city buses. There are a lot of restaurants in the hotel area- some better than others. We ate at I Leoni D'Abruzzo a couple of times, simply because we found the waiters so enjoyable.

Incidentally although this is a Best Western Hotel it is independently owned by the Pucci family which obviously is why it sets it apart from the rest. We arrived at 11.30 am which was clearly too early for check in but that wasn't a problem. Vincenzo on the front desk advised us to take a seat and our room would be ready shortly so we took a seat in the bar and had an ice cold drink and sandwhich while we waited. The bar is extremely inviting and relaxing - the prices for drinks here cannot be beaten in Rome - only 1 euro for ice cold water and 2 euros for Italian beer. We often called in at the bar after a morning of sight seeing to take some water and ice up to our room and also used room service which is free! The room was light and airy - the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was supplied with everything you could need and more - toiletries i.e. shower gel, body lotion, shampoo, soap, cotton buds, nail file, toothbrush and paste etc. In addition I like my tea and so I requested a tea and coffee kit from reception which is free and comprises a kettle and cups and coffee, milk, tea and sugar for you to use for the duration of your stay. The room was cleaned on a daily basis by the maid and we always came back to a freshly made bed and a fresh supply of towels. The breakfast here is legendary - I have stayed at a number of hotels in Italy and have never come across a better breakfast than this one - the choice and quality are excellent - scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, tomatoes, turkey, ham, cheese, boiled eggs, numerous fresh pastries - I can higly recommend the chocolate one!, croissants, cake, biscuits, a selection of different fruit every day, fruit juices, yoghurts, breakfast cereals etc. The cappuccino is excellent - we had one every day! It is only a 5 minute walk maximum to Termini train station and we have found this to be an excellent base as you can get around so easily on the Metro system which is very easy and very cheap being only 1 euro for a single journey. We used it every day and find it much easier and convenient to use than a bus. Although we had heard that Termini area can be dodgy we have never found this to be the case and have always felt safe and been OK even when out late at night. This was our 2nd trip to this hotel and it certainly won't be our last. We love Rome and we love this hotel and the staff which for us contributes to a good holiday.

Coincidentally, our air-conditioning worked perfectly throughout the blazing August heat. The service was exceptionally good I thought, everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful. For us the only slightly negative aspect was the hotel's location. It is a little way out of the city centre. Although being a short walk from Termini train station does mean you can get a bus to any location you like because it is also the main bus terminus for the city. Termini (like any other city train station in Europe) does attract a fair number of migrants and homeless people and lots of hawkers trying to sell you watches/plastic parasols etc. It is fine during the day, but coming home at night with young kids we tended to take taxis back to the hotel rather than going via the station since it did feel a little unsafe. I would still highly recommend this hotel. If you are heading out at night a tip is to walk from termini towards piazza della Repubblica, this is a much smarter area, with nice bars, restaurants, opera house etc. We came across a modern italian restaurant there called 'Cotto' (Via Torino) which was fantastic.

They were too old and grumpy. - No coffee/tea in room. - No mini bar. - Bar: Despite the barman also having to be the bell hop, when three people were waiting at the bar to be served (and pressing the bell), the gentleman behind the front counter couldn\u2019t be bothered to serve us. We all sat there for 25 minutes waiting for the bellhop/.barman/concierge to get a chance to do his bar job. - Snacks at bar: Stale and gross. I wouldn\u2019t serve it to my dog. - Shower: Poor shower pressure. - No free internet. - Staff recommendation of restaurants: they only recommended restaurants in the area where they get a commission for you to eat there. - Location: About 15 minutes walk from the station. It is on the wrong side of town. It is about 1 hours walk into the \u201cold Roma\u201d town. It is close to the metro but is in a dodgy area. - Lack of tv channels. All in all, this is the final drop of the hat with me and best western hotels. I will never ever stay with this chain again. Extremely disappointed.

We enjoyed waking up each morning knowing we'd have a hot and extensive selection of items to choose from, including an amazing selection of fresh pastries. -Multilingual staff regardless of the hour, able to answer questions. -Clean, spacious to European standards, decorated and comfortable rooms. -Great toiletries, complimentary internet (1 desktop) and Wi-Fi. -No problem accommodating 3 of us in one room (without the third person getting stuck with a rollaway bed!) -It rained on 6/1/09 during our last day there and they offered us umbrellas to take with us around town. Cons: -Lacking tour options/suggestions. They had a few pamphlets, but were not proactive in suggesting ideas of places to explore. -Location (mixed). The area is safe and clean. There are a handful of Tratorrias and dining options within a few blocks, but none we visited were particularly lively or authentic. But, the hotel is a 6-7 minute walk to Roma Termini which made for easy transportation to the airport (11 euros by the way), and connections to other cities outside Rome.

The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was a good size and nicely decorated (as was the rest of the hotel), with a good sized bathroom too. All was spotlessly clean - the hotel looks very well cared for and is a credit to those who clean and maintain it. For what is a very pleasant hotel in a European capital I thought the price was pretty good value too. The breakfast buffet offered a good and plentiful range of hot and cold food and was easily able to fill me up until dinner time, and the bar prices, while not cheap, were reasonable and certainly cheaper than in some other hotels. The free evening nibbles at the bar also went down well! Tea-making facilities are not automatically provided in the rooms but are available on request at no charge - they arrived quickly, but it took a couple of days to establish the 'process' to refresh supplies reliably... hardly a catastophe though! Free wireless internet access was a nice touch and very useful, and there was a good size room safe. The location was great - I had heard that the area around Termini was not too hot, but in seven nights there (including one unseemly 3am stagger back from the Pantheon) I never saw anything or anyone which gave me the slightest cause for concern. Hotel Canada is north of Termini and I'm lead to understand the area south of the station is 'worse' - whatever the case, the area immediately around the hotel, and between the hotel and the station, is fine. While Termini is certainly not central to the major sights, it is the only place where both underground Metro lines cross and is a five minute walk (10 minute stroll) from Hotel Canada. From Termini the Metro (16 euros for a 7 day pass, including busses) will get you within about 15 mins of all the key sights - the Metro can be very busy but if you've been to London it's no worse, and at least it's smaller and simple to understand! Termini also has a great Eurostar link to Naples (something like 90 mins and 36 euros) which we used to get to Pompei, and the same train in the opposite direction will take you to Florence for the same price and similar time. It also has a direct rail link to Fiumicino airport (about 30 mins, 22 euros (taxi would be 50 euros)). In the week I was there I didn't need to use (the apparently pretty suspect) taxis once, and being so close to Termini made getting anywhere, both within and outside Rome, easy. More generally in Rome there are a tedious number of street vendors trying to sell you crap (they switch from sunglasses to umbrellas in the blink of an eye at the first sight of rain - actually quite remarkable!). While I did not see/hear of any pick-pocketing activity while I was there I understand it is rife, and you do see some strange characters on the trains sometimes. The secret I think is to look like you're conscious of what's going on around you and that you have any valuables/bags under close observation - and to be very direct if approached by anyone you don't like the look of. The vast majority of Romans though are friendly and happy to help out if you're stuck - it's a wonderful place and I'm looking forward to going back already.

My wife and I stayed at the Best Western Canada for 6 nights in February during our first overseas vacation (we're from the U.S. near NYC). I want to testify to the pages and pages of satisfied reviewers. We too thought the hotel was terrific for the same reasons - nice room and bathroom, tastefully decorated, spotlessly clean, nice breakfast, friendly staff, and fantastic location near Termini and subway. I would definitely stay there again. I would like to give some perspective to my 5-star rating. This hotel is rated as a Class-3 based on some independent scale of hotel amenities. Are there posher hotels in Rome? Sure. My opinion (and others too I think) is that it's a 5-star Class-3. I'm a value shopper so here were my reasons for booking based on the previous reviews that I had consulted. Number one was a very fair price (at least off-season when I went - $130 euro per night). Number two was location. My wife and I are public transit people (as opposed to cab people) and don't mind, even expect, and mostly enjoy a healthy degree of walking (which of course fits right into my value shopper bent). So my intent was to take the train from Fiumicino Airport to Termini Station ($11 euro each) and then the subway one stop to hotel ($4 euro each day pass). I'm happy to report that this worked out perfectly and that the hotel is one block from the Castro Pretoria station on the B-Line. The Rome subway system is comprised of 2 lines that intersect at Termini so for my money the hotel couldn't be in a more perfect location. That said if money were no object at all are there better locations to stay in Rome (near Spanish Steps, etc.)? Well, maybe - but if money is a consideration and/or you intend to do public transit then I don't think that there could possibly be a better hotel in Rome than this one. If you've been to New York City it would be like staying in a nice hotel near Penn Station instead of uptown on Fifth Ave. Rome was fantastic. First thing we did after checking in was to return to Termini and purchase a RomaPass (south side of Termini at street level). Next thing was to take the TrambusOpen hop-on hop-off from Termini (we never got off) - it was a great way to get a 2 1/2 hour overview of the city (about $15 euro each). We took a day trip to Florence via TrenItalia train from Termini. Random thoughts...Never felt unsafe anywhere (but use a money belt). We enjoyed every place we ate. Fantastic pizza to go around the corner near the subway (Pizza Rustica) - stopped for a slice every night on way back to hotel whether I was hungry or not. Use Google maps to plan out your itinerary and check out the street-view tool - I knew what our walk to the hotel looked like before we even got to Italy. Hotel bar prices very modest - had a nightcap every night. If this sounds like your kind of place then don't think twice.

I think they upgraded us to a junior suite because we had a beautiful large room with a seating area too. The decor in the whole hotel was in immaculate order with some really lovely original features, like the old style lift. Everywhere was spotlessly clean. The staff could not have been more professional, friendly and extremely helpful. The gents on reception were always willing to share their knowledge with you on the best way to get to any particular attraction and anything else you may need to ask them. The hotel wasn't in the smartest looking area, hence the price, but it was extremely well located with just a 5 minute walk to Termini Rail and Bus Station. This meant we were close to the Metro and the Buses which were very frequent, cheap and a very efficient way to get to any part of the city. Bus numbers 40 and 64 take you to the majority of the attractions on the main roads through the centre. We got a 'Terravision' bus to and from Ciampino airport which took 30 to 40 minutes. It cost 24 Euros for two of us return when we booked it Online and I would highly recommend it as again, it is quick, efficient and easy! It picks you up right outside the airport arrivals area and drops you off at the Termini, just a 5 minute walk to the hotel. I must mention one restaurant but I'm a little hesitant to as I'd like to keep this hidden little gem a secret! It is the L'Archetto in Via Germanico, a road just round the corner from the Trevi fountain. The staff are really friendly and the past is really fresh and tasty. It's magnifico! There must be around 40 pasta dishes to choose from as well as pizzas and various meat dishes. The menu is really extensive but I would highly recommend a trio of pastas where you have three different pastas of your choice (or the chef's choice if you ask him). It isn't a really heavy dish but very tasty and a wonderful way to try different pastas and flavours. The house wine is very good too. We had 2 starters, 2 main courses, a litre of house white and a coffee and it came to 52 euros which beleive me is very reasonable in Rome for such excellent quality. It is a very typically Italian restaurant, small and cosy. One tip on the trips, we purchased an 'Audio Tour' for the Collosseum, Pallatine Area and the Roman Forum for 6 Euros. You have your own telephone looking device and a map and when you get to each point, you tap in the relevant number and it tells you all about that section as well as the overall history. We thought this was great as we could go at our own pace and learn as much or as little as we wanted to. It's very reasonable too. We hope your trip is as good as ours!

Wow! We were not disappointed. This hotel is 5 star posing as 3 star. We chose an upgraded room, well worth the extra money as it was large, with queen size bed, sitting area, dual aspect views across the city. Housekeeping service excellent, wonderful decor and furnishings (Room 512). Bar service brilliant with free appetisers and on our last night there was free wine (Novello - which is the Italian equivalent of Beaujolais). Bar prices cheap considering it is Rome. Massimo is an extremely polite and endearing Italian barman and hotel assistant. He's always smiling! Concierge service first class - they all speak excellent english and remember you very quickly, having your key ready for you as you approach the desk. Breakfast is good considering the kitchen is quite small. We had a good variety of foods to choose from - something for everyone I would say. Getting out and about from the hotel is easy as it is just across the road from the Metro station - giving you access to historic Rome. We used the tickets you buy at the Metro which give you unlimited access for buses and underground (7 day ticket). Don't forget you need to validate your ticket as you get on the bus by using the machines on board. The best bus to use from the hotel is the 492 which you catch just around the corner from the hotel. It goes all the way to Vatican City (St Peter's Square). Easy bus ride into centre of city as the metro doesn't go that central, the 492 is great for visiting the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, and Pantheon ( a must-see at night when the square is all lit up ). Eating out is great wherever you are in Rome but it does get expensive when you are near the major sites. We chose to eat out near the hotel and loved the 'Taverna Pretoriana' (opposite Mama Angela's) on Via Palestro, a couple of minutes walk from the hotel. It gets very busy with Italian businessmen, families, trourists, etc and has a fabulous atmosphere. Food is very reasonably priced and it is good quality. Some of the other Trattorias close by sell cheaper but poorer quality meals. At Pretoriana you get a free taster of Bruschetta, and a complimentary glass of their own Limoncello - nice touches. A word of warning about 'Terravision' who operate a transfer service to/from airport to Termini rail station - we booked as the reviews from this web site were good. We won't be using them again. Their service on the morning we arrived in Rome was abysmal. There must have been about 200 people waiting for the shuttle buses when we joined the queue. The Terravision Team were very dismissive when asked how long the buses would be. They kept shrugging their shoulders and saying '5 minutes' or '10 minutes' - we waited an hour! The organisation was very poor, and we have since found out that you can actually come out of the arrivals building and pick up an ordinary shuttle bus which costs less than Terravision. Finally, a word about Ciampino Airport - chaos! You queue, and you wait to check in, you queue and wait again to go through security (which takes ages), queue and wait again at Passport Control and hope they have more than one person on duty, then you queue again at the gates and if you are lucky you can get one of the few seats available while you wait again to board the buses to the plane. Watch out for the people who short-change you at the coffee bar once through security. They did it to us and other people who were on our flight. It might have only been a euro each time for us but think how many travellers pass through this area and buy food and drink from them. Nice little scam! Very few people would notice they were short changed as you are easily distracted by other things going on in this area. Check your change before you walk away!

We booked it through air-miles (would be decent value for money generally anyway), and were pleased with the reviews on this web-site. However, there was a hint of nerves as we have had variable experiences of Best Western hotels in the UK. It turned out to be a perfect choice for us, and it was great to have such a lovely base for several days of tiring, but massively fulfilling, walking around this amazing city. I can only speak in very positive terms about this hotel. The hotel, generally, felt very classy, very well furnished, and full of lovely little touches (e.g. antique looking desk in room, shoe polishing kit in wardrobe). The room was a good size and very well presented. We had read another review of issues with the lift in the hotel being too small etc. With respect, I think the reviewer missed the point somewhat as the lift is a wonderful addition to the hotel, and has a charm of its own. Staff at the hotel were very polite and very helpful, any requests were dealt with quickly even if busy. Breakfast was very good, a good selection of options to fill you up for your day of walking, including hot food which is always welcome. Get there early though, as it become very busy after 7.30-45am and its not the biggest breakfast room. Location is excellent, easily located within 5 minutes walk of termini station (its right at the far end of Via Vicenza) and Termini is a helpful compass point to find your way back to the hotel from wherever you are in the city.

It is otherwise not an easy walking distance from too many other places but on a quieter street. The room was pleasant and quite satisfactory in terms of space and cleanliness.

There was a good supply of toiletries, even down to cotton buds and toothbrushes. The beds were extremely comfortable and everywhere was very clean. Breakfast was buffet style with a very good choice of food from bacon and egg to ham, cheese, fish, fruit and many types of breads. The only criticism was that we had to wait ages for our tea and coffee. The bar in the hotel was very reasonably priced (unusual for a hotel!) and they did toasted sandwiches for 2 euros. Also they served lovely free nibbles during the evening. The barman was really pleasant and helpful. The reception staff were very helpful though they appear rather standoffish to begin with and they could provide information as required and a useful map. There is a room to leave luggage in if you arrive early or depart late. There are plenty of restaurants nearby to choose from so we never had to walk far to be fed! If you want the tea and coffee making facilities you need to ask at reception for them - they are not supplied in every room. The trays are not automatically refurbished each day, you need to ask at reception for extra sachets etc. The hotel is situated about a 10minute walk from Termini, the main railway station where you can catch the A and B line Metro and there is another Metro station just round the corner from the hotel that you can use to get to the Colosseum. The Metro is not that useful for getting around to see the main sights but at present they are constructing a Line C which will connect many of the famous landmarks. Termini is also good for getting one of the open top bus tours round the city, you can pay one price for staying on the bus or another price for using it as a hop on, hop off facility. There is a big taxi rank at Termini or the hotel will order taxis for you. Comfortable, flat shoes are an essential to bring with you! I booked two tours with Presto Tours (having read some reviews about them on TripAdvisor) before we went to Rome. One was for a tour of the Coliseum, the Forum and Ancient Rome and the other was to the Vatican. Both were excellent. We were in small groups (up to 16 people) and the guides were very well informed but with a sense of humour so we were not too bogged down with information! The advantage of the Vatican tour was that this tour company are one of the few that can miss the very long queues (2 hours) to get inside and we had fast track entry which really helped. I would certainly recommend them if you have limited time in Rome and want to make the most of your visit. This was my first trip to Rome and really enjoyed it. I did the touristy thing and threw a coin into the Trevi Fountain so hopefully I'll be returning soon.

There is a metro round the corner from the hotel - Pretorio but Termini is in walking distance too. The 492 bus from Tritone goes to just round the corner from Pretorio too. There are several restaurants close by to choose from too. Use the Roma pass if you are there for three days or more as it is great value and saves having to think about train/bus tickets. We ate at La Tavernetta in Via Sistina and if you find yourself outside thinking about going in, keep walking!!! At best you'll have a very poor meal, at worst you'll be well and truly ripped off. We were charged 101 euros for a terrible meal and I left shaking and nearly in tears as the waiter was so horrible to us. Overall Rome is lovely, the sights and the art are worth the visit.

What did not work so well was that we struggled to regulate the temperature of the room - it was tightly sealed as a result of the glazing and it got very warm. We were advised that the airconditioning was not turned on until later in the month so we had to have the windows open to cool the room (We had two sick children at this end of the trip) which made the room very noisy - we were woken several times at night by car alarms. We had come to the end of a long trip so were a bit tired and with the kids sick we sought advice on the first night on where to eat locally (we were happy with pizza) and it was spot on. The next night was a different matter. We asked the other receptionist on the second night for suggestions and were directed to a \"highly recommended\" local pasta restaurant. (The first guy had said there was no local good pasta restaurant) We went anyway but it was very ordinary and filled with people from the hotel! Obviously a kick-back deal rather than a true recommendation.

Our room was on the first floor and was very comfortable and spacious with a separate area for our daughter through an open doorway. The room was decorated with antique furniture and frescoed ceilings, the bathroom was clean and spacious with an ample supply of toiletries a hairdryer, even toothbrushes. Previous posts have mentioned the street noise, which would be unbearable but for the 2 double-glazed units and shutters. Thankfully as it was October we were quite comfortable so didn't need to leave the windows open at night. There is a small bar behind the reception area furnished with sofas and pictures of the Pucci family who now own the Canada which gives it a personal touch. The bar has a small menu offering drinks, tea, coffee and ice-creams and sandwiches, enough for a lite bite between sightseeing, and Massimo the barman puts on a spread of nibbles, little pastries, olives etc, every afternoon and evening which are free to customers. The breakfast room is situated at the foot of the stairs and opens from 6:50am til 10:30, and as we had to leave at 7:00am on our first day it was a bit rushed! There was always plenty bacon, omelette, fresh fruit, bread rolls, pastries yoghurts, all nicely presented. All the staff were very pleasant and efficient and happy to answer any questions and on our last day we were able to leave our luggage while we enjoyed our final hours in Rome. The hotel is situated at the end of via Vecenza just a short walk from the termini so no need to hire a taxi. We just made our way there every day and hopped on one of the many buses and found it quite easy to negotiate our way around with a little forward planning and a map. The only negative point I would make is that the area around the hotel is quite noisy and dirty, it surprised me how much graffiti there was, but this isn't the fault of the hotel and many areas were the same, it wouldn't put me off a return visit. I would gladly recommend this hotel and would love to return in the future.

It was so lovely to get away from the more touristy areas in Rome and by taking a \u20ac1 bus journey end up somewhere quiet and uncrowded. The other plus is that the hotel is exceptional.

The lobby was very pretty and clean. Vincenzo checked us in. He was great. There was a discrepancy with our reservation (1 person instead of 2) and he just fixed it without all kinds of problems or grumblings (completely unlike our experience in our hotel in Sicily which was a nightmare). We speak English and Spanish and Vincenzo spoke to us in both (plus the little bit of Italian that we tried on him!). He was so helpful in finding out info for all different sites and was esp. helpful getting us info on the free Genesis concert at Circo Massimo that weekend! Our room was very nice and VERY clean - the most important thing to us actually is cleanliness so we were really impressed. We even strip the beds in hotels to make sure there are no bed bugs and these matresses looked almost brand new. There wasn't alot of surface area in the room which was kind of annoying - everything ends up piled on the one desk and 2 tiny night stands. The room's architecture was really pretty - vaulted ceiling, soothing mural painted on it. The bathroom was VERY clean but the shower was too small - but I think this is common in Europe. Also, the drain was clogged in the shower and we had to have them come up and fix it. They came and fixed really immediately after we called though so it wasn't too aweful. I have to say, the MOST FABULOUS thing about Hotel Canada was the breakfast! Tons of food and variety for the price. No, it was not the best food we've EVER had but it was the best hotel breakfast we've ever had anywhere, by far. There were lots of Americans and English speakers which was interesting. This is def. a tourist hotel so if you want an authentic and more \"rustic Italy\" sort of experience, don't stay here. This was our first time in Rome and we really liked the fact that this hotel was so nice, safe and that we looked forward to going back to our air conditioned room after our days of marathon walking in the 100 degree heat. There is a really good restaurant called \"Rossi\" right across the street which was great too. VERY overpriced but so convenient and the food was really good. Ottman was our server and we just loved him - he helped us with everything we needed from food to directions to sites to teaching us about the differnt pronunciations for Italian foods in different parts of Italy! We really liked the hotel bar area too - it was quiet and relaxing and they had a little desert bar one night with little cookies and chocolate cake. We hung out there and talked with Edwin who was serving at the bar one night. Such a nice guy - we had fun talking to him in English and broken Italian. He told us about the Americans who he had met there and what states they all came from ( which was almost every state in the U.S). Overall, we had a great time in Rome and staying at Hotel Canada was a huge part of it being such a great trip. We would absolutely stay at Hotel Canada again! Also, we did not find the area of, near or around the hotel shady at all. It actually seemed quite busy with tourists and locals, even late at night, so we never felt uncomfortable.

I had booked the Hotel Canada for 2 seperate visits to Rome in the same month as we were transiting Rome..once enroute to Florence, and another enroute to Positano. On both occasions the rooms given to us were absolutely beautiful! Had we stayed somewhere closer to the normal sites of Trevi Fountain, the Colleseum, The Vatican etc etc, it would have cost us 3 or 4 times what it did. The rooms that we were given were spectacular...and we were impressed. I still can't believe how lucky we were to find it, and how reasonable the rate was. The Hotel Canada is down the end of Via Vicenza, near the Roma Termini...within easy walking distance. I haad read that it was a somewhat dubious area, being near the train station and all, but we did not find it to be a problem at all. Infact we found a nice little restaurant close to our Hotel that we went back to as it really had the best food in Rome that we had! The rooms...the first time we stayed there..we had a great room with big windows out to the street. It was huge especially compared to European standards. We had a beautiful ornate king size bed, a sitting room with stunning furniture, and a great big bathroom- the size of some rooms in Rome! The room was superbly decorated, with lovely pieces of furniture, beautiful bed linen, and loads of space. I really felt spoiled, and very much like I had stepped into a a fairy tale. It's nice to feel like a Princess.. :-) The room was spotlessly clean, as was the bathroom. The second stay that we had proved to be as good as the first. Which I thought would have been impossible. The room we were ggiven was just as beautiful as the first. We had a lovely big bedroom decorated with lovely furniture, and a little Juliet balcony, a seperate sitting room with a lovely chaise and desk in it, and again a huge big bathroom. It was spectacular. The public areas are really nice, and we spent one evening after being out for dinner in the bar, which was pleasant, and unbelievably priced. Infact, I would go so far as to say that it probably has the cheapest bar prices in the whole of Europe! Great cuppucino's as well! The breakfast room was really nice....very bright, and very pleasant. It also had the best breakfast that I had during my entire 6 weeks in Europe!! Everything you could want or ask for was provided.

One senior, two aduts, two children (ages7 & 11). We were intially drawn to the Best Western name because we feared small, dirty hotels and felt a known corporate name was safer. We were pleasantly surprised to find excellent traveler reviews of this hotel and we weren't disappointed. The staff was friendly and easy to communicate with. Our children really enjoyed the Italian lessons as the staff encouraged them to ask for the room keys in Italian. All in good humor, we never felt any pressure to speak Italian. We made all of our inquiries and the reservations via email and had no problems at all. There were many restaurants within easy walking distance. The main train terminal (Roma Termini) was a very, very easy walk from the hotel. There was a laundrymat a block away with very reasonable prices and a fantastic pizza by the slice place a few doors down. We always felt safe in the neighborhood, day or night and definitely always felt safe anywhere in the hotel. The rooms were spotless, the entire hotel was truly immaculate. The buffet breakfast, included with your room, was very generous, quite tasty and had plenty of different items to choose from. This was a fantastic hotel to use as a base. In addition to the train station so close, a subway station was literally around the corner. The room shared by four of us was very large, which we didn't expect. The senior room was smaller, but since it was a single occupancy, that wasn't any problem. Closet space was generous. We had a color TV, 2 phones, large private bathroom and wireless internet access (about 6 Euros for an hour). There were plenty of channels on the TV, but most were in Italian. We mostly watched CNN World News or viewed DVDs on the laptop we brought. But, there is so much to see in Rome, we really weren't \"home\" enough to need entertainment via a TV. It was truly a pleasure having our coffee in the lounge areas. They also offer complimentary cookies in the bar area in the evening. If we had anything at all negative to say, it was just personal preferences: our room faced the street and it was pretty loud. If we closed the window, no problem, but we were there in March and the air conditioning was not on yet. Turning on our in-room thermostat would only get us heat. We like it cooler and had the window open most of the time. It did usually cool off the room for us, but made it difficult to hear even the TV. It took some getting used to the constant car horns. So...if we didn't need the window open, we really wouldn't have anything negative to say. Oh, and for those of you with little ones, they don't have the safety bars on windows like we are used to in the U.S. - no screens either. If you open the window and the shutters, keep the little ones away from the window. We just couldn't say enough nice things about this hotel and the neighborhood. We are always ready to go home at the end of any trip, but we truly felt sad leaving Hotel Canada, and Rome. We will return to both! We've attached two photos, just the two sides of the room with beds. There was also a desk area and the bathroom not pictured. We had concerns planning a trip with such a mixed group of ages.

The hotel is situated just east of the Termini Station, about a 5 to 10 min walk. You are able to access the various tour buses from the Termini. The hotel is also just a couple of minutes' walk from the nearest Metro/subway. Despite being a 70-room hotel, it has the feeling of a smaller, family run hotel. The person who took our suitcases to our room also served us drinks in the bar and was seen again the next morning, working in the kitchen! The reception staff were courteous and helpful and were able to communicate in English (although we always used the bits of Italian we had mastered to show willing! This seemed appreciated). The room we had was a quad room. We were very impressed with the layout - our boys had two single beds in an area separate to us - and the room was clean, ornate and high-ceilinged. The bathroom was clean and had a shower over a bath. Our room was on the Metro side of the hotel. There is a fairly main road on that side so the nights were quite noisy. Once we found our ear plugs, we were fine! The breakfasts were self-service and good enough to set us up for the day - scrambled eggs, bacon, cheeses, hams, etc,, plus cereals, fruit, yoghurts, toast (with various jams etc), sweet pastries and orange juice. The staff were quick to clear tables and to provide coffees and hot chocolates. Apart from a toasted sandwich, this is not the sort of hotel where you can eat and lunchtime or in the evening. We were directed by the Reception staff to Rossi 3, just a block away from the hotel (towards the Termini and on the other side of the road). This is a breakfast/pizzeria/bar restaurant just a couple of minutes' walk away at Via Vicenza 23. We ate there 3 out of the 4 nights as our young children didn't want to venture far in the evenings after a day's sightseeing. The restaurant is casual but attentive. The menu was mainly pizzas and pastas (which our children adored) with a few alternatives. It was very reasonably priced, good food and easy. All in all we were impressed with the hotel. It is basic (hence the 3* rating) but is extremely good in its class. The area isn't very central but the transport links are easy to access. It is also a little `dark' along the Via Vicenza but we didn't feel uncomfortable with it as there are always plenty of people around.

Also don't eat at the Trattoria next door, which the front desk recommended to us when we arrived late and hungry.

It was a major thing to get back to the hotel from the old center . The neighborhood is safe but not very nice to wander around in. Too far to walk into the old center.

Very overpriced, the waiter spoke hardly any English (not his fault) and waited 40 min for a check after asking a few times. Most of the restaurants have the same menu in this area. The Bistro was good as well as Rossi 3 . Don't bother with Gemma alla Lupe. We were seated next to the WC unknowingly at first. The waiter brought drinks and we moved to another table 10 feet away without using any napkins or tableware. Well, the waiter went on about the cost his boss would suffer for laundering the napkins which we pointed out we didn't use all to no avail. One morning I asked the desk to call a taxi. We had a reserved time for the Vatican tour. He tried a few times and said to me they are all busy. No other explanation. I guess that meant walking to the train station so off we went and found the buses were on strike. Huge long lines for taxis. Needless to say we missed the Vatican tour.

Before we arrived I had emailed them 2 or 3 times and they were always quick to respond and very helpful. Without exception, the staff was polite and kind throughout our stay.

We were amazed at how hard the bed was (like a slightly padded pool table), but were even more surprised at how well we slept...must have been the 3 or 4 miles we walked every day.

A large breakfast is offered (free) every morning from 0700-1030 which kept us satisfied until around 2pm when we would stop for gelato and an espresso.

The funicular ride up to the town is fun, then a little shuttle takes you to the cathedral (Duomo) square. Before you take the shuttle be sure to do a quick tour of the fortress ruins and the gardens to the left for lovely hilltop views. A fun day away from Rome.

There were some nice restaurants near the hotel, but we felt that quite a few of the restaurants in Rome have a lack of transparency with their pricing, e.g service charge AND cover charges which were different on the next visit. One place we stopped for a light lunch appeared very reasonable but charged around 30 Euros for three small slices of cold pizza and three cokes and when we questioned the bill she said they made additional charges for the napkins and straws! However most places were very friendly and the final bill usually worked out very similar to those in the UK.", "Date": "August 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Davis, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location!\u201d", "Author": "otterpop", "ReviewID": "UR5629401", "Content": "We got to Rome's main train station and walked the five blocks to our hotel to check in only to find that the first night of our 3-night reservation was not available.

We highly recommend this lovely hotel and were treated very kindly by its professional and courteous staff. When I booked our reservations on the internet, I asked for the AARP/European Seniors discount, and was informed in an email to mention this upon our arrival to get the rate. Upon checking in, I did ask for the AARP discount rate, much to the confusion of the receptionist. He knew nothing about this particular discount, so it was denied to me. Of course I was somewhat miffed, but proceeded with my two accompanying family members and all our luggage and the very agile and friendly bellman Marino into the smallish European elevator to our accommodations on the 5th floor. We were very tired and very bedraggled after the previous night's flight to CDG and that afternoon's travel. When Marino opened the door to our room, I was delighted to see a lovely generous sized bedroom with two comfortable singles and a queen size bed in an alcove. There was a pleasant seating area and table, a desk and thoughtfully placed shelves for nightstands. The bathroom was immaculate and well-appointed and also of a generous size. Best of all, my younger daughter was there to greet us, having arrived in Rome on an earlier flight and being given admittance to the room by the helpful staff (I had called from CDG to request this). After the family reunion, we left to explore the immediate neighborhood and get some dinner (and gelati!). I thanked the desk clerk for our lovely, comfortable room and he told me that he had further checked and we were entitled to a room discount and the rate was better than I expected! Wow! Things were definitely looking up! Other reviewers have commented on the number and variety of restaurants in the neighborhood of Hotel Canada. Have no fear! You will easily find plenty of reasonable and enjoyable, friendly evening dining places in the immediate area of the hotel. My particular favorite was Leoni d'Abbruzi just down the street--I described my meal there to a friend as \"hauntingly delicious\" and her son said, \"It was so good it scared her!\"--yup. That's true. If you go, make sure you order the homemade gelato for dessert....better than San Crispino IMO. But back to Hotel Canada. There is a little bar with a variety of complimentary snacks in the late afternoon, and beer, wine and even Coke prices are very reasonable for that area of Rome. Each evening we collected a bucket of ice from the friendly, courteous barman and used it to ice the copious amounts of water we drank to rehydrate from our days of hiking around the city and its sites. We appreciated this touch of home so much and we know better than to take it for granted. Breakfasts are delicious, generous and surprising items show up on the buffet tables, like frittatas and scrumptious coffee cakes and one glorious morning, even the king of cheeses! We looked eagerly for parmigiano reggiano on following mornings, but alas, no. The morning breakfast lady was somewhat comical--she wasn't too pleased with me when she profferred cafe americano like my earlier arriving husband only to have me chirp \"Cappuccino, per favore!\" when asked my beverage preference. She didn't offer refills on the cappuccino, but I can't say that I blame her. While schlepping our baggage from the cavernous and confusing Termini to the hotel wasn't a lot of fun, it's certainly doable. The only sketchy part of the area around Termini isn't really all that bad, and quickly left behind once you cross via Marsala and trundle up one of the smaller streets that intersect it. Still, if I could figure out how to bargain for a taxi without paying 20 euros to go--what? maybe a little less than a mile?--to the hotel, that would have been my preference. The same hotel desk man who checked us in offered to get us a cab to the airport for 45 euros, but I had already purchased our Leonardo Express tickets. A called taxi from the hotel to Termini on a Sunday morning with luggage, he patiently explained, would be ridiculously expensive, so we just dragged our junk back ourselves. Coming from other hotels on the streets around the area, we had plenty of pedestrian luggage-dragging company. Hotel Canada will definitely be our choice on any future travels to Rome. If you are staying there for a few days and purchase metro travel passes, there is a convenient and close Metro Linea B stop just up the street.

The hotel is fairly small and a couple of Metro stops out from the main tourist areas but don't let this put you off.The metro station is just yards from the hotel lobby and - once you've mastered the ticket the machines- easy to use and cheap (1 euro per trip). The rooms are spacious,well decorated and clean with plenty of original features. Coffee making facilities were provided on request and the general level of service was well above what you might expect in a hotel of this class. Breakfast was good and served in a pleasant morning room. Unusually, this hotel has a very nice lounge bar area (also very cheap) with complimentary canapes. The lounge is well used in the evenings. Only complaints (well ,not much really) - the shower seems to face the wrong way over the bath (bit of a squeeze)and the ancient elevator is a bit of a challenge (although you might call it character). The hotel has no restaurant but the surrounding streets contain plenty of reasonably priced trattorias - the concierge is happy to make recommendations.You'll have to go into the Spanish Steps area or Via Veneto if you fancy something upmarket (the Hard Rock is easy to get to on the Metro if you need that burger fix.) Last tip - get the concierge to arrange any taxis for you and agree the price first with the driver(the tales about tourist rip-offs in this city ARE true and taxis are not as user friendly or as plentiful as in most other major cities).", "Date": "January 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ewerby, Lincolnshire, UK", "Title": "\u201cLived upto the reviews\u201d", "Author": "Bob5858", "ReviewID": "UR4313473", "Content": "Having read the reviews for this hotel I had high expectations and was not disappointed. We arrived very early in the morning on the Terravision bus from Ciampino airport. The hotel is a few minutes walk from where the bus drops passengers off at Termini station (it is conveniently located up a side street just across the road from the bus dropping off point). I must admit I wondered whether I had chosen the best location as we walked up this side street at night (although it was well lit). However, we never experienced any problems at all with the area in our seven days there. We were warmly greeted on arrival and shown to a comfortable spacious room with large bathroom. The room was triple glazed to keep out any road noise as our room was fronted by a main road. The glazing worked very effectively and we had no problem sleeping. The quality of breakfast was very good and the restaurant staff were always very helpful and pleasant. The bar area of the hotel was great for relaxation in the evening with very reasonable prices and some nice snacks laid on. Whilst we were there the hotel has some novello wine tasting evenings during which one could sample italian cheeses, meats, olives and bread washed down by some fine wines - at no cost whatsoever! The location does mean that you have to walk a little to get to some of the central sights but the effort is nothing for any reasonably mobile person. If pushed the underground network is accessible outside the hotel on the main road or alternatively at Termini station a few minutes away. We only used it once to get to St Peter's basilica and the Vatican Museum. The bus station is also at Termini.

It was about a five minute walk from the train station. Go out of the right side of the train station as you depart the trains rather than the front of the train station.

Turn right and the hotel will be down the street on the left (just about at the end of Via Vincenza). The Metro is around the corner from the Hotel. We had one of the biggests rooms in the hotel, which did have air conditioning. The room was very quiet. There is a quaint elevator which does hold two people and their luggage. The breakfast had quite a large selection which included several hot dishes. It turned out, it was the only hotel we stayed at in Italy which offered hot dishes for breakfast. We had drinks at their bar, where the prices were surprisingly very low. Down the street from the hotel, about one block, was I Leoni D'Abruzzo, a great restaurant. Rather than eat outside, we went downstairs to eat inside. The food was very good and the menu extensive. We went back the next night and tried other things on their menu, which, again was very good. I definitely would recommend this hotel. The location, breakfast, rooms, and bar were great. On a side note, I would like to mention a bus tour we took. It was the \"Citysightseeing Roma\" open tour bus. We picked it up in front of Basilica S. Maria Maggiore. I do NOT recommend this tour bus. You do not get to see anything but Piazza Venezia and the Vatican Piazza. We got off at stop four for the Forum but had a hard time finding it. We had to wait over an hour for another bus to come by to get back on. In the meantime, we saw at least eight-ten other tour buses go by, which were all the same tour bus company--I believe it was the Red 110 bus company. \"Citysightseeing\" just tells you this is the stop for the Forum, but doesn't tell you where it is.

There are numerous restaurants in the vacinity, asking for recommendations at the reception desk is advised as we were given discount vouchers for 2 restaurants, both of which we visited and both of which were very good.

The hotel also has a bar (open from about 4.30pm) - which had the cheapest drinks we found in Rome, plus canapes/nuts/crisps were on offer all night. Breakfast was good - typically continential - bread, cheese, pastries - plus bacon and eggs. A couple of tips - 1) buy your ticket for the Colosseum up on Palatine Hill - saves joining a very long queue at the colosseum ticket office, instead you walk straight to the entrance. 2) arrive at the Vatican as early as possible - we arrived 40 minutes before it opened and found the queues ok, once it opened it only took 8 minutes to get inside 3) Visit Santa Maria Maggiore - a fantastic Basillica between Termini Station and the Colosseum - it contains a 'mini' Sistine Chapel which is my opinion was more spectacular than the original 4) Don't forget to take a shawl/wrap/cardigan to cover you shoulders when visiting Basilicas, also no shorts.
