Thoroughly recommend upgrading to a suite with its many facilities. We would however have liked a more comfortable sitting area with some softer furnishings and even some pictures on the stark walls.

It is about 6 blocks from Paseo de Gracia - the main commercial/shopping area in Barcelona - in between two of Gaudi's best works on Paseo de Gracia, La Pedrera and Casa Batllo. We moved to this hotel from a different 4-star hotel from Las Ramblas because we wanted to be in an area where we would feel safe at night. Las Ramblas is an excellent area to shop and be a tourist during the day, but after 9pm even the taxi drivers told us it is not smart to be walking around. So Acevi was a hotel we found to be in a safe area still within a walking distance from all the major attractions. Our room was fantastic! It was a spacious king bed room that felt like a suite. The entrance was large and felt like a foyer instead. The bathroom sink was separated from the shower/toilet and that made it very comfortable. The hotel has great staff, all very friendly and willing to give advice. The wifi is free, which is a great feature not available at many hotels. If there are any drawbacks to the room it was probably the lack of large windows, but that is a recurring theme in many Barcelona hotels because of the proximity of the buildings. Overall, the rooms were very clean, though the attention to detail was not great. In other words, it is a well categorized 4-star hotel, not close to a 5-star hotel. The bar/restaurant \"106\" has great food for a good price. Finally, the price for the hotel was very reasonable for a 4-star, even though we booked it within a week of travel. The neighborhood was great as well. L'eixample has several bars and lounges for all types of people. It appears that there's a bar on each block, which gives tourists a great variety. The walk to Paseo de Gracia is only about 10-15 minutes. Perhaps a hotel closer to Paseo would be better, but you are unlikely to find one with a better price. Acevi was definitely a great hotel that we are likely to visit again in the future. It is good for couples and even children. The property is clean and quiet, and the surrounding neighborhood is comfortable, populated with several eateries and bars, and the walk to touristic areas is reasonable.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Floresta, Distrito Federal, Argentina", "Title": "\u201cAwful, not a 4 star hotel at all\u201d", "Author": "Caro C", "ReviewID": "UR128064852", "Content": "We stayed there 3 nights. When we first arrive they treated really nice, but it was just for the first day. The room was big, I cannot deny that, and the bed was comfy, but apart from that, the room had nothing else to offer. The room could have been more decorated but it wasn't. The walls where white with nothing on them. The TVs where from the 90's (come on, even 3 star hotels have flat screens now!!). They offer you free wi-fi on their site, but it does not work once you arrive unless you sit on the floor next to your bedroom door or go to the reception. The bathroom could have been nice with more lights, but as they where just a few and didn't light up at all it wasn't. The cards on the room say that room service ends up at 11:30 PM. However, if you call at 10:30 PM they won't answer. When we got tired of waiting we went down to order our own food but they told us that the kitchen was closed (at 11:15). The breakfast was good, well, the food was, but the dishes where not washed very well. Sometimes you could find lefts over of food on them. Last but not least, on the last day, just before a taxi picked us up, they where so rushed for us to go that they took out our luggage (from the luggage room) and they did it with so little care that they broke one of my bags and didn't stop to say sorry.

It is also easily reachable from the airport (and back) given the Aerobus Shuttle service that stops in Urgell station. On the other side of the story you may find the hotel has two types of rooms, in what seems to be a newer and an older part. We got a room in the old part and there was no WiFi coverage, although it was free! So we ended up taking trips to the lobby in order to access the internet. Room service was ok, not very generous with the soap and towels, they had a single small bottle of soap for two persons/day. We had to ask for more.

I asked why this is not mentioned on their website or on bookings,com? The answer was the manager wanted to market the gym this way. When I went down to the gym and found the gym consisted of one running machine, and weight bench and a collection of free weights, Note they are missing some of the pairs of dumbells. So if you were looking for the 16kg weight you only got one! On top of it the weight bench was under the AC which was dripping water on the bench so I had to move the bench, When I went to the reception to complain they gave me some story that the gym is part of the so called spa. The spa is 2 dark treatment rooms, a dark and dingy whirlpool and sauna. For me this is totally wrong marketing and communication and to charge 10 EUROS per day for a running machine and some dumbells (not complete) is a total rip off. They reception said they would speak to the manager and see what he says. When I checked out they still did not remove the charge, The recpetion staff would not even LISTEN to me (age old rule ...listen to customer and customer is always right) They only wanted to argue with me and talk over me the entire time.

The Jacuzzi area was nice, it was ideal to chill out after a day of walking. The location was good, the hotel was minutes from Urgell metro station and about a 15 min walk to The Ramblers. We were told by so many people to watch out for pick pockets, I didn't really feel too threatened by anyone and didn't hear of any stories where people has been targeted so just like anywhere you should be sensible with your bags etc. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone", "Date": "February 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cRecommended\u201d", "Author": "LondonTraveller1978", "ReviewID": "UR24083427", "Content": "This is a smart, modern hotel in a good location in Eixample.

There is no bar, which I think is a good thing, and whilst we didn't try the restaurant, both the evening dining and room service menus seemed reasonably priced, unlike the breakfast tariff which at 14Euros sounds outrageously expensive - like many before, we found a decent enough cafe further down the road on the opposite block where we were able to buy a Cafe con leche and croissant for 2Euros per person. The down side: whilst we could barely hear the traffic noise, our neighbouring room unfortunately was occupied by loud (or very deaf) people (who were obviously practising their tap dance routine on the wooden floor) with apparently little appreciation of either accoustics and other guests who might wish to go to sleep before 1.30 am! There was a locked link door to this adjoining unit, presumably intended to open to provide a family room for those with kids, which certainly didn't help, but the walls appeared to be of the standard (I hesitate to use the much-repeated phrase) paper-thin variety! The Urgell metro stop is a handy 2 minutes away and the bus service to the airport is excellent - just two blocks from the hotel and taking 20 minutes (4Euros each), so don't bother arranging a taxi.

I think maybe the staff didn't understand us but there are lovely treatments available, we just didn't avail! We had to fly to Reus Airport as our flights were cancelled to Barcelona.
