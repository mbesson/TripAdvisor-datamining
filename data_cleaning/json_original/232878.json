The room was spotless with a nice firm bed, satellite TV with chanels from all over Europe, mini-bar, very useful for my own snacks (does anyone ever pay for overpriced items provided by hotels?!) I came prepared with mini travel kettle and tea-bags as past experience revealed that tea-trays are not always provided in Italy. The bed was firm and comfortable. It was clearly a newly-decorated room as there was still a bit of masking tape around a light fitting!The bathroom was very nice - all marble with powerful shower. We found the staff in reception friendly, though not all of them spoke very good English - but we believe in trying to use the local lingo, however painful it might be to local ears. There were maps and posters about tours. The breakfast was varied and plentiful with lovely fresh rolls and good coffee although the quality of the juice was disappointing (overly sweet and probably made up from dried or concentrated mix - sad in a country that produces delicious citrus fruits. Lots of different pastries, cheese, salami and not very good ham. The restaurant advertised a 2-course meal with mineral water for 15 Euros, with specialities from a different Italian region each evening. We didn't get to try it during our stay but it sounds very good value, bearing in mind typical Rome restaurant prices. It is not easy to get to the hotel from the airport by public transport. You can either get the Express train (expensive, takes 30 mins) into the centre, then go out again on the metro + walk or bus, or take a shuttle bus. Shuttle bus prices vary tremendously, as does the time they take. If you don't want to pay for the Express train, you have to get the stopping train, get off at Ostiense station, then change to the nearby Metro station, which confusingly has a different name, 'Piramide', then get the Metro to Palasport. The hotel is set back a bit from a very busy 6-lane road, but the traffic noise wasn't too intrusive. Overall, a nice, comfortable hotel and you have to weigh up the good price against convenience.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Targu Mures", "Title": "\u201cVery nice room, shame about the rest\u201d", "Author": "Hajnal I", "ReviewID": "UR123213548", "Content": "Reasonable location, easy comute to central Rome.

This hotel was really on the outskirts of Rome, we had to take a bus which took 5 minutes to the metro (don't forget to add about 20+ mins wait for the bus to turn up) and then we had to get the tube from there. On the was back from the metro station you still had to wait a couple of minutes for the bus but this time it takes about 15-20 minutes to get you back to the hotel as it goes through a different route. The bus stops are very near by the hotel. There was a massive mall next to the hotel where we went to get dinner each evening as we were worried that we might miss the last train/bus (they don't run very late). The lobby: The lobby was nice and looked quite posh. There were plenty of sofas and sitting areas. Most of the receptionists spoke good English but they weren't exactly friendly apart from 1 - Sergio. He went out of his way all the time! So I suppose he made up for the rest! We never received any information about any tours or any activities going on. On the very last day they put up some posters and when we required about them they said they were always on there - well no, they weren't. Cleanliness: I have always been happy with a comfy bed and a clean bathroom to have a shower and rest after exploring all day. For a 4* hotel I would expect to at least have a clean bathroom and clean floors. We stayed for 4 nights. When we checked in the room was not clean to begin with, there was rubbish on the floor and hairs all over the bath, sink and toilet! I cleaned the shower myself so we could use it. There is very poor ventilation as there are no windows in the bathroom so there is mold on the tiles and the shower curtain. Also the bins were emptied but if there was rubbish around the bins it was not collected or cleaned. It wasn't anything major, but it was not pleasant and did not have that luxury you see in their pictures and descriptions. Beds: I give the bed 10 out of 10 for comfort! Very comfortable and clean white bedding! However we did not have a proper duvet but instead we had some old blankets which did not smell nice! Room: The room was very spacious and it had everything you could possibly need for a short break. Prices: EXPENSIVE! Nothing is free. To use the Wi-Fi you had to pay 6 euro for 12 hours or 6 euro to use their computer in the lobby for 1 hour! The mini bar prices were ridiculous, small bottle of mineral water was 3.50 and a can of coke was 4.50 euros. The restaurant had a special deal which was 15 euros for 3 course meal, I personally did not think the dinner was that good and definitely not worth the money. Breakfast: The breakfast was very early 6:30am until 9:45am and weekends it was 6:30 until 10am. 10 out of 10! Had very good choice of variates - croissants, donuts, biscuits, yogurts, different bread buns, cold meat (ham,cheese and salami) toast, all sorts of jam and honey. Amazing coffee, but rubbish juices! I do believe the red orange and the pineapple were supposed to be concentrated with water. It did not taste right to us at all Swimming pool: As we went in early January, the swimming pool was covered up and not in use. It looked rather small, so I wouldn't be surprised if the pictures that were shown on the website are not the actual pictures of the hotel's swimming pool. Overall I would personally not go back and I would not recommended for any of my friends or family. Don't forget you have to pay a City Tax of 3 euros per person per night when you check out. If you stay in a 3* or lower hotel you will pay 2. I know its just a euro but every penny counts especially in overpriced Rome! At the end of the day I do not believe this is a 4* hotel. So if you are planning to go ahead and book it don't have your hopes up too high and do not be fooled by the pictures!", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice pleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "StormyIllinois", "ReviewID": "UR122044994", "Content": "Hotel was as rated, average.

Though we had no response I mentioned my email on arrival and we were very happy with the room allocated, although the double bed had two single mattresses. It was very clean and the furnishings of good quality, though there was no outdoor furniture for the large balcony. Our room was in a separate block from the main hotel building, so although we were not disturbed by the neighbouring shopping centre deliveries, the view was across to the extensive shopping centre parking with some very modern blocks in the background, but not as unattractive as you may suppose from this description. The bathroom was small but had a very powerful shower over the bath, though this was merely regulated by the bath taps. The air-conditioning was excellent. The dining room was pleasant, but apart from breakfast which was uninspiring but plentiful, with a fairly wide continental choice, after hot days in Rome we ate in the Euroma 2 centre previously mentioned, mostly choosing the two caf\u00e9s which offered good, authentic Italian food, though there were plenty of places like McDonalds offering cheaper alternatives. Transport links - a five minute bus ride to the metro and then 20 minutes into Rome - were good and very frequent, though often overcrowded at the end of the afternoon, and there seems to be no limit to the number of people allowed to board an already crowded bus! That was the worst part for me, though nothing to do with the hotel. The dual carriageway at the end of the hotel's drive wasn't a problem as there is an underpass at the foot of the steps leading down to the shopping centre entrance. Although the hotel premises are kept very clean, the large dustbins at the end of this drive are not very welcoming. My husband took advantage of the pool, but said it was like swimming in untreated tap water, and was disappointed that it was not opened before ten in the morning, as he likes an early morning dip. And now a warning! We were not made aware by the travel company through which we booked this hotel that an accommodation tax was to be paid before we left, which was rather a shock as it amounted to 48 euros for the two of us. Also, even though I asked for receipts for that and the payment of the car to the airport, no receipt was forthcoming. However I didn't find the staff unhelpful, though obviously busy.

We soon found out that our choice had not been very clever. The pool was okay, nothing spectacular in the surroundings and we even had to rent towels. The staff at the reception are unfriendly. Our room which was facing a shopping center car park looked worn and tired. It has a small balcony but the balcony was very dusty, looked as if it has not been cleaned for a few months. The bathroom is compact. The morning breakfast is the same for all the 4 mornings we were there. Hard buns, cold unfresh croissants, cheap cakes, 2 kinds of same meat slices every morning ...... However, I must say that the coffee machine has done justice. It gives hot normal coffee, cuppacino and warm milk. Location wise, one has to take a bus (in front of hotel) to Euro Fermi station, then take a metro into city center. You may have to change metro lines depending on where you want to go. Once you get the hang of the public transportation, it is not so much a hassle to travel around. Remember to buy a couple of transportation tickets at one euro. You can buy them at stations and also at another hotel kiosk situated about half a km away. The Cristoforo Colombo hotel has one very good advantage. There is a shopping center Euroma located next to it so in the evenings, if you find it a bit too much to take bus and metro into town, you can just go to the many restaurants in the shopping center.

Daylight brought a slightly different opinion, but it certainly seems to be well away from any local shops (but does back on to an enormous shopping mall - Euroma 2). I was a bit surprised at how far the walk to the Metro station was - it's certainly not the 5-10 minutes some of the other reviews seemed to suggest, probably more like 20-25. The trick with this was to get a weeks ticket from the Metro station, which gives you bus travel as well. There's then about 5 buses that pretty much run between the Metro and the hotel, but be a bit careful about which ones you get back - only three of them stop right outside the hotel. The Metro itself is probably about 20 minutes into the city centre, but we did struggle a bit with the Termini station, where the two Metro lines cross over. There's a lot of building work going on, and you have to take some major detours when swapping between the lines. The hotel itself was nice and clean, although the TV channels are somewhat limited, and while wi-fi is available, it was 6 Euro for a 24 hour card. The room had working aircon, window shutters, and a little balcony (but unfortunately it overlooked the car park and the back of the shopping centre!) We didn't have any dinners there, but breakfast was more than adequate. The staff were very friendly, and as ever most of them were English speaking. If you don't want to eat in the hotel (I think the evening meals were about 20 euro), there are lots of food places in the shopping mall, which are open till 10pm.

We were planning to stay until Sunday but came home today instead (we had booked only for last night thankfully) I will never go back there and the only good point about this hotel is its closeness to the Palasport, which is used for sporting events and concerts and the reason of my chosing this hotel.

We stayed in the Hotel Cristoforo Colombo for five nights, and were scheduled to stay there for our last night in Italy before flying back to Toronto.

Although it was a less than ideal situation they handled it very well, and the entire ordeal only took about an hour out of our trip. My only complaint about this hotel is that it is quite far from the rest of rome. I had read many reviews before booking, and assumed that the people were exaggerating the walk to the subway station, but it is quite far. You can take the Blue Line subway and get off at EUR Fermi which is the closest station. From there you can take a bus (I can't remember which number bus) that will take you within a few minutes walk from the hotel.

As mentioned in my title it is a comfortable accommodation if you live on an island or very far from the airport you need to reach, as it is located near an exit of the Grande Raccordo Anulare (the ringroad around Rome connecting to the highway) but not directly on the traffic-congested main road (named Cristoforo Colombo). In fact, it is around 50 m inside on a private area and this gives you the immediate feeling of a quite tranquil place to rest. Check-in is quite brief but not particularly warm. As the resort is formed by several buildings inside this private area (with parking area free of charge in a back-yard), the receptionist will explain you in which one is your room, but nobody will accompany you nor bring your luggage into your room, which is decidedly strange for a 4-star hotel. However, rooms are objectively small for the 4-star category but well decorated and quite comfortable (a good number of international SAT-channels is also available). Equally small but comfortable and well-equipped are the bathrooms. Considering the cheap rate (due to a last minute booking) we paid, all in all the accommodation was good value for money, but not the hotel location, as problems arise when you go to bed: vehicle circulation is allowed throughout the various buildings, so you'll spend part of your night being awaken by motorbikes or cars just outside your window as well as other guests arriving late in the night and laughing and making a loud noise as if it was midday! Furthermore, the hotel restaurant already closes at 21:30 hrs and if you get this information from the receptionist and have just arrived at the hotel, nobody will tell you that almost all of the restaurants in the neighbourhood of the hotel are closing by 22:00 hrs! You'll discover it personally but you'll be able to find somewhere on foot a few restaurants still open in the middle distance. The breakfast buffet is among the positive features of the Cristoforo Colombo Hotel: a wide, bright restaurant room with many buffets (continental and British breakfast, i.e. a large variety of sweet and salt food) are available with warm & cold beverages - though no yogurt nor fresh fruit. Among the disappointing aspects a significant role is played by the internet connection: it's on charge (OK, no problem, if the service is adequate) but very, very bad, as admitted by the receptionists too. You'll waste most of your time in unsuccessful temptations of connecting yourself and then will give it simply up! The internet point available near the reception averages at the same terrible level. The hotel management is trying to improve the quality level of this service but it seems to be more difficult than foreseen. All in all, some positive aspects but also some handicaps which can be tolerated, in my point of view, if you pay a special cheap rate but would get me quite angry in the case I would pay the very expensive official rates shown on the back of my room door!", "Date": "January 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel.

Once you get into the lobby, it is nice and clean. The staff was nice, and helpful when asked, but not overly friendly. Our room was of adequate size (I've heard fairly large for a European hotel) and very clean. It had 2 twin beds, a balcony (not big enough for a morning breakfast, but nice enough to step outside for some morning air or a smoke or something), a color TV (only had 3 channels in English - MTV, CNN, BBC), a mini bar, a hair dryer, 2 plugs that had adapters build in, and an average size bathroom. Breakfast is included with your room. It's not great, but it is enough to get you started with your day. They had prosciutto and cheese, breads, a few cereals, milk, coffee (not the good kind -- from a single serving machine), teas, hot chocolate, red orange juice and pinapple juice. Dinner at the restaurant was very good (worth the money) but not outstanding. We did not try the room service. The main issue seems to be the location. I think we were in a business district but far from the heart of Rome. We were with a group, who luckily often bussed us to locations, but otherwise we opted for a cab. Be careful, learn how to ask \"how much\", and know it should be anywhere from 12 - 20 euros to get to your destination depending on where and traffic. Estimating 50 euro each day for transport, you're still much cheaper at this hotel than paying for one in town. I was told it was a hike to the metro or bus stops, but once you got the hang of it, it was much cheaper than a cab. You can buy passes for one or more days -- I think 3 days was 11 or 12 euro.

Although the pool is not very big, many Roman hotels don't have this luxury and it is very handy on a hot summers day!

As for speaking english... remember we are in their country. If you make a little effort in Italian, such as hello, please, thank you etc, it goes a long way and they will make the effort back. Pool is great too with free towels and a bar open in the evening. The last amazing thing I will tell you. directly next door to the hotel there is a man with a van who arrives in the evening and parks in the petrol station. he sells freshly cooked sausages, meat filled panninis and all sorts of italian snacks. He also sells bottles of beer and soft drinks.

If you are looking for a five star resort, where you spend all your day in and get pampered, this is not the place. I had read so many scary reviews of the cheaper places in Rome, that I almost changed my mind about going to Rome. This hotel is a place I would definitely go back to, if I ever go back to Rome (which I probably will). Negatives: - Its parking lot exit is right next to a busy road. You need to be careful if you are walking out of the parking lot. - The walk to the metro station is a pleasant one, but it is 25 minutes long. I suggest you take a taxi to your destination anyway. Taxi's are not that expensive, specially if there are more than 2 people sharing them. There are many minivan type taxi's in Rome which fit 6 people very comfortably. Positives: - It is clean. None of that sewer smell stuff you hear about other hotels. - It is quite. You won't even know if there is anyone in the next room. - Very nice shower with strong water flow (water temperature fluctuates a bit...). - Continental breakfast. Nothing fancy, but decent enough. - Air conditioning. - TV with some English speaking channels. - In-room programmable safe. Again, if you are the spoiled type with lots of demands, do yourself a favour and pay 300-500 euros a night and stay somewhere else. If not, stay here and pay less than 100 euros per night (we were there at the end of May, 2005).

We weighed up issues of value for money versus proximity to the city center and decided that we as we would only be using any hotel as a place to sleep and eat breakfast we would go for the most economical option. In our opinion the Cristoforo Colombo more than delivered. Yes the hotel is on a busy street, but there are crosswalks and neither we nor our fellow Cristoforo Colombo residents heading into Rome seemed to encounter any difficulties there. The bus stops are very close by and while the metro station is a little further away it should also be walk-able for most. Like an earlier reviewer, we too spent a longer than planned evening in Rome city center and ended up having to get a taxi back from the city center. (It turns out a taxi ride in Rome is not to be missed!) It only cost 15 Euros but then he did drive extra fast! We found the breakfasts to be perfectly adequate. There were coach parties using the hotel who tend to 'swamp' the breakfast room at set times, but the breakfast supplies keep arriving from the kitchens so the buffet table was regularly replenished. Many of the city center accomodations we investigated for a similar price didn't offer breakfast at all. The weather was very warm particularly during the first few days of our stay and the swimming pool was wonderful after a hot day's sightseeing. There are not many city center hotels with swimming pools! This was a luxury we really enjoyed. Our room was very well furnished and the bathroom was particularly plush. The rooms are certainly smaller than many American hotels, but very tastefully furnished and clean. There was also an electronic safe in the room. We ate one evening meal in the hotel, it was pleasant enough, but there is a better local restaurant just around the corner from the hotel offering anything from pizzas to full meals. We found the staff at the hotel to be polite. The rooms do lack information leaflets/brochures, but the reception staff we talked to were happy to direct us to the bus stops, the swimming pool etc and they also booked the taxi for our return trip to the airport. We we worried about pickpockets in Rome but didn't encounter any security issues anywhere, but then again you must take responsibilty for your own property. Why risk leaving a purse or handbag for a few seconds in any hotel anywhere, not just the Cristoforo Colombo? In our opinion this hotel was good value for money, but this obviously depends on your priorities. This hotel probably wouldn't be a good choice for those with mobility problems or possibly those with small children who might want to take mid day breaks.

I've read on some reviews the road takes half an hour to cross (were these people crawling?!!)
