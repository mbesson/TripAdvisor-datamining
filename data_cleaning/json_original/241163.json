Just try to avoid rush hour traffic going into downtown/The Strip, as everything slows to a crawl. The hotel's neighborhood is low-income housing, so you would probably would not want to go strolling around late at night, but why would you? The only things within walking distance are (A) 7-11, (B) McDonald's, and (C) Wal-Mart. On the plus side, the staff was friendly and helpful. Especially Jasmine, day clerk, who was happy to let us look at three different rooms before selecting one we liked. NOTE: The third floor has mostly smoking rooms, but even the non-smoking third-floor room we looked at smelled of smoke. Instead, we chose a room on the second floor, which is all non-smoking. The continental breakfast (served 6-9 a.m.) is basic: apples, oranges, cold cereal, yogurt, coffee, tea, juices, various white-flour pastries, and a waffle machine which turns out a hot, fresh, waffle in about two minutes (kids loved this). A TV on FOX played the whole time. Our room was clean and in good repair. We had two queens, a TV, micro, fridge, iron & ironing board. (My wife is paranoid about bedbugs, so we checked both beds thoroughly. We found none. There is no street noise to speak of, as you are a couple of miles from the freeway and half a block from Craig Road (the main road nearby).

I would say it has been a total of 7 times. Each time i have showed up with my advertised special coupon from a traveler's magazine. The price states $39.99 for two people. It seemed kind of funny that each time i showed up they would tell me the rooms were sold out. The days were random from a Sunday at 9:00am to a Tue at 3:00pm, ( even a Wed!). It was all hours and days .One time, as my wife waited in the lobby for me to pick her up ( 2:00pm- 3:30pm) she saw customer after customer enter with their coupon and the same was told to them. They were offered the $49.99 and said that that was the only rooms available. She swears that she saw most customers check out for the day and the parking lot was virtually empty so how could they be sold out if check in time is 3:00pm? This made me wonder that they just don't want to honor the price and is a fake draw in gimmick. The last time time i went i was ready to approach the manager about this. I went in and asked if i could get my coupon honored. The front desk once again told me the same. I confronted them about how uneasy i felt knowing that it can't be true. The receptionist then told me that they cannot honor the coupon and will get in trouble if they do. I became furious because i knew that i was right all along. I told them that it is very unethical to lie just to bring in customers. They should discontinue the coupon if they never intend on honoring it. She saw this and honored it but, said that she was noting on my account that i could never use the coupon again because i was given the rate already. Nowhere on the coupon does it say it is a once in a life time coupon. I am so angry and can't believe that they would lie! Note*** i am a frequent traveler and have never had this experience ever!
