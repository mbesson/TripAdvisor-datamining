Not to mention the tiny elevator that can fil either two skinny people or aone person and their luggage, actually gave us quite a giggle, very unique. If you can overlook this you will enjoy your stay in this quaint hotel. It is close to Termini station and less than a 10minute walk to the Colosseum and Palatine.

This area the hotel is in gave my stay a true \"roman\" feel, when you opened the shutters you could see people on vespas racing down the streets, see people enjoying coffee, pizza, and gelato in the restaurants down below.

We chose the hotel because of its proximity to Termini station and also the amount of good reviews it had received on tripadvisor. We certainly were not disappointed, it is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in at a European city, especially for the price we paid. From the minute we arrived to the minute we left, it was welcoming, friendly and cosy. All of the reception staff we encountered were cheerful and extremely helpful in offering advice on the best places to eat etc. and were all very knowledgeable in providing good information about their city. They always had the time of day for your questions. The room was very spacious, clean and tastefully decorated with a comfortable bed and good overall facilties. My only slight complaint is that the bathrooms are very small and cramped but it was no major problem. We had a room overlooking the street which was great for us as we loved having the buzz of the city come in through the window. If you are easily disturbed or don't like a lot of traffic noise, I would suggest requesting a room at the back of the hotel. The continental breakfast on offer was delicious and had a large variety to choose from. The lady who looked after you at breakfast was again very friendly and worked hard. The breakfast room is on the 6th floor and has an outdoor terrace area overlooking the city. Although it wasn't 'officially' open up to use with it being winter, we asked if we could sit out on 2 of the mornings and it was no problem. It's very pleasant and I can imagine it being beautiful eating breakfast out there on a summer morning. As for the location, the hotel is just 5 mins walk from Termini, very handy for the shuttle coaches and train services to both Rome airports. The Colosseum is just a 10 min walk away through a very nice park and the historic centre is a 15-20 min walk away. You will find many hotels a lot closer to the historic area and its attractions but take my advice, if you want a friendly, well priced, good quality, decent hotel, then look no further. We enjoyed every minute of our time in Rome and much of this was because our stay at the Doria was excellent.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hertford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLong weekend in Rome at the Hotel Doria\u201d", "Author": "Susan D", "ReviewID": "UR125383142", "Content": "Our trip was from the 10th - 14th February 2012.

There is nothing fancy here but the hotel met our expectations: good value, well-situated, rooms clean and comfortable, attentive staff. There are however a few things that should be kept in mind if you do chose to book. First off, ask for a room facing the courtyard. The rooms facing the street can be noisy, especially with the windows open. Secondly, if you are claustrophobic, the elevator will be a challenge. In this case make sure that your room is on one of the lower floors so as to not have too many stairs to climb to your room. Another small detail that management should take into consideration: we would have loved to take better advantage of the roof-top dining area. I understand that there could be security issues with it not being staffed at any other time besides breakfast, but we would have loved to have shared a bottle of wine up there and unwind after a day of taking in the beauty of the Eternal City.

But when we arrived on Friday evening, we were told that we had no room due to a water pipe burst but they had booked us a room at another hotel. This hotel was inferior, on the other side of the Termini Station and we had specifically chosen this hotel due to its location away from the station. I asked to see the room to confirm that it was a water issue but was told the manager had no key. After refusing to leave the lobby, and basically throwing a fit, the owner called and continued to claim it was a plumbing issue. We had been warned of this sort of thing, and after asking other residents about water issues, it became clear we were being lied to. Eventually, the owner admitted that he was lying but that on Friday evening there was nothing to do, and not being able to find another room, we had to settle for the other room.

The room was warm & very clean with a window overlooking Via Merulana & Santa Maria Maggiore (wonderful church) which is noisy but there 3 series of windows/shutters and once you close them you don't hear any noise. The lift is tiny, 2 small sized persons can just fit in there but we found it very cute and funny! The area is excellent and very safe, we had absolutely no problem walking back to the hotel late at night. We never used the metro or the bus, we walked everywhere even to the Vatican city, Trastevere, Piazza Navona, Quirinale, Fontana di Trevi, Pantheon, Piazza di Spagna, Via Veneto, Villa Borghese etc. Rome is not that big so you don't really need the transports if you enjoy walking. The best way to explore Rome is to walk as it's such an amazing city full of sightseeings and attractions that you may miss if you use transports. From Termini station take the Via Cavour which will lead you just behind the Santa Maria Maggiore. Via Merulana is just facing the front side of Santa Maria Maggiore. It's a 10 minute walk to Termini and very easy to locate the hotel if you can read a map. Breakfast was continental buffet with a big variety of things to eat, try the hot chocolate - it's delicious! The Breakfast room is tiny but you can eat outside on the small terrace surrounded by flowers. Staff is excellent and very helpful, all receptionists & the lady serving breakfast are so gentle & polite. I would go back to Doria hotel. We loved it!

I am a 5'7\" woman and had trouble moving around in the shower - I can't imagine what a 6'2\" man would do!

It can be difficult to find without a map - so make sure you have one beforehand! Cannot fault the hotel - room was looking out on to the Via Merulana, which is busy and noisy, but was not a problem at all -although might be in hot weather with the windows wide open if you are a light sleeper. Staff very friendly and helpful, especially the man on reception who spoke excellent English. Bathroom spotless and yes, very tiny, but if you know beforehand you can have a good laugh - shower cubicle was a good size however and no problem. As others have mentioned it is not a really central hotel but the Colosseum and Forum are only 15 minutes walk away and Trevi Fountain and Pantheon not much over half an hour - and you see so much more when you walk! Area around Termini is a bit seedy, but we had no difficulties, and the area near the hotel seemed very safe at night.

The concierge was very helpful, the rooms were quite small but clean and the continental breakfast was excellent. The ensuite bathroom in Room 103 is very small and the tiny showers have to be seen to be believed! The elevator is also amusingly small and not one you would enter with someone you didn't know very well :) Road noise was minimal thanks to double-glazed windows and the air conditioning made the summer temperatures bearable. When looking for places to eat steer well clear of the Antico Caffe Santamaria (around the corner from the hotel) as the service, prices and quality of food were abysmal and the place was dirty and full of flies! The only reason we ate there was we hadn't slept for 48 hours and wanted a quick snack before having a rest (i.e. we were desperate!). Another place to avoid is the nearby restaurant Tempio di Mecenate which served the worst pizza we have ever eaten (hardly anything on it). If you are looking for a reasonably-priced place to grab a snack and a drink (alcohol, soft drink, coffee etc.) we would strongly recommend Bar Do Brasil (turn left out of hotel and it is down the first or second left laneway). This place was frequented by local people, had great service and was well priced. There is also a great little pizza place called Pizza Republica which is just down the road from the hotel (turn left and follow your nose).

Breakfast is on the roof upstairs which is provides lovely views of the city and the cold buffet is basic but filling and plentiful. Location wise the hotel had some lovely restaurants near by and was roughly a ten minute walk to the Coliseum, over all Rome was much more compact than we had anticipated and it didn\u2019t' t take long to walk past the metro stops! The most convenient stop for the hotel is arguably Vittoria Emanuel which is just around the corner, plenty of ice cream shops to tempt you on the way!

It got off to a bad start as we simply could not find the Hotel. It is not 250 metres as some websites state from the Termini Station. It is about a 10 minute walk (that is if you walk in the right direction!) We unfortunately walked for 1hour 30 mins trying to find Hotel. In the end we had to ask a lovely Italian lady where the street was. As she could not speak English nor we Italian, she went out of her way and took us directly to the street. We would probably never have found it. Just shows there are still some nice people around. The best description I could give is from the Termini station which has 4 entrances (that is where we went wrong!) get yourself to the front entrance of the Santa Maria Marjorie Church, from the Church entrance, facing away from the entrance, there are two long streets leading away and it is the street towards your right-hand side. After this fiasco things soon picked up for the better. The Hotel was simply lovely. Small reception area with pleasant staff. Agreed with the other posts about the lift being very very small (quite cute though), luckily we were only on the first floor and just carried our cases up. We had Room 103 which overlooked the main street. Very clean and comfortable. Again agree about the shower being small but it was spotless and brand new fittings throughout the bathroom. Breakfast again very pleasant, basic continental fayre but still enjoyable \u2013 lovely hot chocolate. We were lucky enough to sit outside on the terrace for breakfast each morning (jumper necessary) as the weather was starting to warm up in Rome. The only thing I would change if I were being critical was to move the Hotel slightly nearer the main sites but it is still a really good base but I suppose the nearer you are the more expensive. It was about 15 mins to Coliseum not bad and Trevi Fountain about 30 mins walk. On an evening there were plenty of nearby restaurants but we preferred the Pantheon area which was again about a 30 mins walk but a return taxi only cost us 7 euros.

The food there was the best although more expensive but worth it for the added bonus of a great atmosphere. Unfortunately cant remember the name but look for the piano through the window! Breakfast in the hotel was simple but nice and the Waitress was very plesant. A tip, go before 8.30am as you will likely have to wait for a seat as the Breakfast room is very small and unfortunately we could not eat out on the Sun Terrace as was raining every day!!

My other disappointment with our stay was that our room was on the street side of the building. This meant that noise from the road was really loud, especially as we had to have our window open at night because the heating was on high throughout the building, as it was February when we visited. With the window closed it was obviously a bit quieter, but not much as the bus stopped right outside our room. Having said all that, location counts and for the price we paid per night we got a good base camp for our short trip. If I was to stay in Rome again, I would probably pay a bit more money and stay somewhere else. But, for around $85 (US) a night, it was a good choice.
