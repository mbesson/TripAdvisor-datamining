The hotel is quirky to say the least. The breakfast area is adjacent to reception and consisted of high bar stools and tables and the rear wall has a large graffiti type mural showing scenes from the Berlin Wall. The carpets throughout have a pattern of footsteps which give the appearance of walking in sand, and the bedrooms have a flat screen television which, when first switched on, gives a flame effect fireplace! The rooms are very small, with little storage space for suitcases, and the shower has a full glass door - could be embarrassing for some couples. Having said that, the situatuion is good, right opposite an underground station and within walking distance of many attractions. Although the road outside is very busy, noise did not seem to be a problem, although our room was on the sixth floor. Rooms lower may have been noisier.

The rest of the hotel was the same, from the footprints on the carpet in the hallway to the innovative designs in the rooms. The only thing to mention is if you book make sure you are comfortable about being naked in front of the person you are sharing with as the room has an open bathrom. They only provide soap dispensers in the bathroom, a razor and green crocodile soap for our son but not other toiletries which was fine with us. The included breakfast was by far the best we have had in terms of variety. Usually when breakfast is included in the room price you can't expect much but this one had everything you could want and it was continually replenished and tidied up. One word of advice, if you are staying over the weekend, as we did, get down to breakfast early if you want croissants cause they go quickly and are the only thing that aren't replenished :) The surrounding area is also fantastic with lots of eating options, bars, a laundromat, the train station and a hairdresser all only a few metres away from the hotel.

The hospitality was excellent, the amenities were good, the hotel was clean, the staff were friendly. If the bedroom was even a bit bigger and the bathroom was private, then this would have gotten full marks from me. The hotel reception area and breakfast room/bar were bright, spacious, modern and still welcoming. The corridors and bedroom were also bright and welcoming. However the bedroom is far from being spacious. I stayed in a twin room, and there was about 30cm (12 in) space around each bed, with a little bit more between the two beds, but not enough room for someone to pass another person. Of course, there is no room for seating, so if you want to stay in your room for a while, you will have to sit or lay on the bed. Staying with another person, both can't really be up and about because there is not enough room. The bathroom area is part of the room - the shower is clearly visible from most of the room, as is the sink (the toilet is separate, but has no sink). In order to avoid being seen showering or washing, if you're travelling with a friend, they need to sit or lay on the bed nearest the shower, facing the other way - that or leave the room! One thing that really irritates me in hotels in general is noise from the corridor - the room door was really heavy which I guess is what led to us never hearing any noise from the corridor at all during our stay. We barely heard any noise from any of the adjacent rooms, so I guess the hotel rooms must be well soundproofed. Breakfast was mainly bagels and bread rolls, with various jams and preserves, along with slices of cooked ham, parma ham, cheese and salami, fruit, including little glasses of prepared fruit salad, and a few different cereals. Fresh coffee was provided, and a couple of machines provided various coffee drinks, hot milk or hot water for tea. There was free internet, but annoyingly it required registration (lots of details asked for but I found out that only your name and e-mail is required), and your registration details weren't saved. This meant that every time that I got disconnected it meant that I had to enter it again, and since I was using wifi on an android phone, it wasn't a nice thing to have to do. Still it was fine when connected, though I wasn't doing anything too intensive. There were two computers, one with a printer, at tables in the reception area and an iPad (for use at the reception desk only) - all free of charge. Until 10pm you can avail yourself of free tea, coffee and water just off to the side of the reception desk, which was a lovely little feature - you can enjoy this in the sofa area or bar/breakfast area to the side, or there are paper cups available so you can take your drink outside or to your room. The hotel is very near the Rosenthaler Platz stop, and there are a few eateries and bakeries in the immediate vicinity. Quickest way from SXF airport is the RE7 direction Dessau or RB14 direction Nauen to Alexanderplatz station, go downstairs to the U-Bahn station, and take the U8 direction Wittenau/Osloer Str. two stops to Rosenthaler Platz, turning left when getting off the U-Bahn, then left and left again. At the top of the steps to street level, turn left, then head right around the corner to the hotel, just after the \"Back-Factory\" bakery. Overall I would love to have given this hotel a better score but it has to lose a mark because of the lack of space in the room, which became irritating at times, and the complete lack of privacy in the bathroom.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leuven, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cGreat for travel with children, excellent location\u201d", "Author": "slowlyraoundtheworld", "ReviewID": "UR120205816", "Content": "We stayed in one of the en-suite rooms (2 rooms with interconnecting door) (family of 4).

The position is superb for exploring the city, the breakfast is plentiful and very fresh and also served until 11am (11.30am on Sundays). The free wi-fi in the rooms is a great bonus as is the PC in the lobby which is also free and has a printer, which means you can check in on line for the flight home and print your boarding passes, which is a huge bonus and saved us hours of queuing at Tegel Airport. Beware that the check-in for BA and other airlines is incredibly slow and the lines are horrendous. If you have checked in you can go to bag drop and there was almost no queue for that. Another big bonus was the free tea, coffee and water all day in the lobby. The staff on reception are incredibly helpful, nothing is too much trouble and they always gave us good advice and were very friendly. There are lots of good places to eat nearby, the hotel reception will tell you where to find them. There is also a large supermarket very close by \u2013 REWE in Ackerstrasse (turn right out of hotel then first left at traffic lights and it is on the left.) The hotel is very clean and the room was cleaned thoroughly every day. The flat screen TV is great and there is a reasonable selection of stations in English available. The only problem we found was the small size of the room and the lack of storage space. The shower \u201cin the room\u201d worked fine for us as a couple. I would have liked somewhere to write; there is a hospital type tray/table which goes over the bed, but we used that to put a suitcase on! We asked for a quiet room and it was indeed quiet. At the rear of the hotel, it overlooked flats, but it was so quiet we could have the window open during the night, rather than use the air-con. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, as we found it was great value for money and suited our needs. We definitely want to go back and stay there again.

There certainly wasn't too much space and you could easily get a few bruises from bumping into the furniture but the room was very clean and had everything I needed. The not too wide bed earned top points for comfort: fluffy pillows and covers were to die for after a long day. Service in the hotel was very warm and laid back in a right way. The breakfast room right next to the lobby can probably get a bit cramped during the busiest time in the morning but I managed to fit in just fine with my huge newspaper.

The location was perfect, 30 secs from the metro station, and really close to Alexanderplatz! It was brand new, you could still smell the paint in the hall! Perfectly decorated,playfull, pleasant, amazing!! Also very clean! And cheap... 50 euros per night for a double room! Did I mention the free wireless? The breakfast was more than enough, you could find everything you'd ask for. Also during the day you could have coffee or tea for free and they also provided paper cups so that you can take it out! We enjoyed that every morning :) When I booked it, through a booking website and not straight at the hotel, I requested a room in one of the last floors. I was sure that it wouldn't be fulfilled, because I've done it in the past in other hotels and they didn't provide it, but at All Seasons Hotel, eventhough they were fully booked for the days we stayed there, they gave us a room on the sixth floor!! The only disadvantage was that the rooms were quite small, so it was a problem for our luggages, and that the shower had a see-through glass door and was visible straight from the bed. That is a problem if you are not with your partner. To sum up, if I would go back to Berlin, I'd definitely stay there again. I'd like to emphasize that this wasn't a 2 star hotel. It was more like a 3 or 4 star hotel!", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich, Germany", "Title": "\u201cwonderful location\u201d", "Author": "dani_lore", "ReviewID": "UR88721317", "Content": "wonderful location (the nearest metro station just on the corner; it takes 5/8 minutes walk from the hotel to Alexander platz; moreover PrenztlauerBerg and Mitte are very close ); the rooms are colorful and very comfortable with sink in front of the bed and a large shower. breakfast and wi-fi are included in the price and there's a free pc station for the guests. breakfast is good. the staff is young and polite, but sometimes they have trouble giving suggestions about good restaurants or club. the breakfast lounge is not so large and comfortable especially when there are a lot of guest.", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frankfurt", "Title": "\u201cJust opened\u201d", "Author": "JackTrost", "ReviewID": "UR88240997", "Content": "was in Berlin for a PR function and spent the night at the new all seasons hotel in Berlin.
