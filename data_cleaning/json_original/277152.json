The hotel is advertised as a 3 star hotel and pretty much lives up to the European standard of 3 star hotels, but it's more of a tourist, than business, hotel. It was clean, the rooms were not very spacious but large enough. The hotel is located within a walking distance from both Termini Railway Station and Plaza Republica metro. The neighbourhood has plenty of bars and restaurants. Staff was OK, although there was a mix up with getting a room with a double bed instead of twin bed and they wouldn't want to fix it because we were told that there are no more rooms with twin beds. We found out, however, that all the double beds are just two twin beds put together and we were able to fix it ourselves. One thing that I was dissapointed with was the breakfast, rather poor as for a 3 star hotel despite being quite expensive. For that price, you can have a much better breakfast in one of the local cafes.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hertford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Cold Tiny Hotel !\u201d", "Author": "HaeleyK", "ReviewID": "UR125637909", "Content": "We booked to stay here for 2 nights in March 2012, When we arrived at 10am on the Friday we were told our room was not ready so they would store our luggage, they then gave as a map an sent us on our way !!!

We had to stay there one night and return to them in the morning,. The flower garden was tiny, the room had 2 small single beds, tiny shower and was dark and dull, we did get a quiet comfy night though but hadnt payed for a small twin room.

We went back to the Impero the following day as told to do so and they held our bags again as room was not ready. returned at around 4pm and our room was big and all marble but extremly cold and damp with no tv and no shower only a bath which was horrible, This also had single beds which were hard uncomfortable and wooden so noisy with even the slightest movement. At 2am we were woken by a horrific scary banging noise which frightened the life out of me but there was no explanation as to what this this could have been, could not get baack to sleep as there were noisey people in street and street cleaners!

There are plenty of restaurants and bars in the local area at reasonable prices, The Roof Garden Restaurant next door was welcoming and plenty of fun, full of locals, always a good sign in any country.

We are a young mid-20's couple and all i can say is that this hotel was absolutely perfect. As long as you don't expect too much luxury (or space), you will not be disappointed. We stayed in room 208. It was indeed small but not unpleasantly so. It was very clean and the bathroom was absolutely fine, although the shower was quite small, fine if you are an average build but maybe problematic if you are a fairly wide person. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. For instance, my wife and I developed a naughty habit of returning to the hotel very drunk at 3-4am in the morning, having to knock on the door to get in. The night staff never said a word, just smiled and handed us the key. So no problems there! The breakfast was pretty basic but enough to set you up for the day. And best of all, above everything else is the location. The immediate area surrounding the hotel felt very safe indeed. There were ATMs close at hand and a fabulous restaurant called Est! Est! Est! (serving great big pizzas for 5-8 euros) just along the left-hand side of the road opposite the hotel. Also, there's a cosy Irish pub called The Fiddler's Elbow about a 6-minute walk from the hotel (just passed the Santa Maria Maggiore Church). It's a great little place to meet local Romans and other travellers. And that's not all - this hotel is in walking distance of nearly all the major tourist sites. The only time we caught the metro was to visit the vatican which is across the river (although even this is not very far). Other than that, we walked everywhere and I strongly advise you to do the same for this city is breathtaking at every turn and some of the greatest sites are those stumbled upon. (If you walk down to the Forum, there's a great ice cream parlour named La Dolce Vita on the left side of Via Cavour. Huge portions for 2.50 euros). To summarize, this hotel is excellent. OK, it's not the Ritz but it is still suprisingly well maintained and faultlessly clean. The location is very safe and astoundingly convienient, close to the train station and all the attractions. My wife and I were also a little dubious reading the reviews but were thoroughly delighted when we arrived. Therefore, I whole-heartedly recommend it. Enjoy! P.S. There's a great little cafe underneath the hotel a door down. Cheap coffee for 1.25 euros a cup and an awesome collection of wines and spirits. Don't go to the Washington cafe opposite.

The bathroom was small but ok except for bad smell of sewage had to keep door shut all the time (towels were just average nothing to rave about+ they smelt of vinegar?). The wardrobe had 5 coat hangers none that you could hang trousers on + one shelf - no drawers. Now for the location excellent + safe I travelled with 4yr old son + my mother + her friend who needs a walking stick did not feel afraid of area at all at night. Superb little resturant across street + down some steep stairs its called Tattoria La Grotta Anatriciana very good value + food all freshly prepared -salads + steak particularly good. And strange as this may seem also v. good for fresh food + cheap is the upstairs resturant at the train station. Best coffee + ice cream can be found downstairs ( in train station also) at Moko bar cafe - cappuccino only 1.10 euro. We travelled to Florence on train for the day - worth a visit if you have time. We also went to Naples + across to Capri for the day. Both train jounerys good value for money + on time + clean. I could NOT recomend Greenline shuttle tours 22euro's very poor commentry for local attractions + lets face it ROME has so much to offer.
