I agree with other reviewers that the decor in the communal areas was a bit dated which made me wonder what the apartment would look like. I was pleasantly surprised, the decor was great, colour scheme relaxing and good quality furnishings. The televisions were disappointingly old and not really good quality. My shower didn't work properly, which was annoying, after an very long non-stop journey from London and the air-con/heating unit was unacceptably loud. Once the shower problem was resolved, things were much better. The apartment had a mini-kitchen, complete with coffee maker, large fridge and cooker. More than enough to self-cater. The bar/restaurant attached to the hotel was over-priced but the service staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I'd stay here again, it was an excellent base on a relatively quiet street in the heart of downtown.

Rooms, hallways and common areas are very dated. Although everything seemed to be clean, the place is at a level of a decent Best Western. The location is amazing. My girlfriend and I did not rent a car while in Vancouver and did not need one with this locale. It was close to everything that we were interested in seeing. A few tips to make your stay more pleasant: -There is no coffee maker in the rooms. So, be prepared to get your morning fix, elsewhere. -The in-room air unit is noisy. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to make accommodation for this. -Internet in the rooms is at a steep charge. Walk up Robson two blocks and use free wi-fi at the Starbucks. -Yaletown is three blocks to the left as you walk out the front door of the hotel. There are many great pubs and restaurants. -There is a small grocery store three blocks up Robson. This is great for essentials. Overall, you cannot beat the location of this place for exploring Vancouver. We were attending a concert at Rogers arena and it was just a 10 minute walk.

When we were offered a 1br place on Robson at less than $100 a night, I said great. Then I read some very mixed reviews on this place and became a little concerned. But I have always given un-biased reviews, and this is no exception. Our middle unit was on the 10th floor, looking north, with the library on the left and Robson down below. It was probably the smallest 1br unit they had, but it was just fine for us two, especially for the price. Sure, I would have liked a window in the living room. The bed was pretty comfortable for me, but gave my wife a neckache she never got rid of. Only a foot off the floor, I guess this is an Oriental effect, but not particularly to our liking. I'll bet the maid doesn't like changing the bottom sheet, which was fitted, but didn't fit well. Large flat screen non-HD tv, with a small tube tv in the bedroom. Bathroom only large enough for one person at a time. Showerhead was nice, but flow was barely adequate. Mini-kitchen was adequate. Small dining table with 2 chairs, along with 3-person sofa and matching chair, made for a tight living room. Carpet and furniture appeared to be fairly new, but dark finish and dark carpet made for a very dark room. No problem with any of the staff. Free maid service provided on the middle day was fine. Extra washcloths requested and provided. $25 internet for the week worked well. $16/day parking. Grocery store 3 blocks. We were halfway between Gastown and Yaletown. Perfect location. Food, restaurants, taxes: very expensive town. Like San Francisco, but better. Elevators worked fine and floor was quiet. Good selection of free movies. Nice umbrellas to borrow. If we could get a larger living room, with a window, and a normal raised bed, with boxspring, and get the same price, we would return.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver Island, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "travelbitt", "ReviewID": "UR119413062", "Content": "We just returned from a one week stay at Aviawest.

It was clean but the carpet had seen better days with lots of stains and also a few on the furniture.

Aviawest controls bookings for forty units in the Hotel. We booked through Hotels.Com during a 30% off summer sale, and nabbed a $139C rate per night for a seven day stay July 17-24/11. Aviawest operates an office adjacent to The Rosedale. You check in at their office. We arrived early, but our room was not ready until the promised 4 pm check-in. We enjoyed a second foor, one bedroom corner suite. The suite (210) is a bit tired. The furnishings are dated, and the lighting neither modern nor bright. The small fridge has a tiny freezer without a freezer door., The stove/oven combo was functional, but not fancy. I suspect other rooms operated directly by the hotel are more modern. Aviawest offers a once-weekly briefing to its guests at 9 a.m. each Monday, regarding what to see to do in Vancouver. It may be only once-weekly because most Aviawest guests are RCI time-sharers staying a week. Aviawest guests, unlike other guests of the Rosedale, do not receive daily room cleaning. You will be offered a once-weekly cleaning, including a change of linens and towels, either on Wednesday or Thursday. There is a charge for this service, unless you are staying a full week. Now about location. The Rosedale (Aviawest) is terrifically positioned for seeing downtown upclose. You are within walking distance of Gastown (must-see), Chinatown, and are practically in Yaletown. GM Place and Rodgers Arena are just around the corner. Parking at Rosedale for car rentals in $11 daily. You have unlimited in's and out's, and we always found a space. Again, this is confusing, but you pay the hotel for the parking, and not Aviawest. Conversely, if you have a room problem, you must contact Aviawest, not the hotel. The Rosedale Pool complex was closed during our stay. The bottom of the pool was being refinished, and they deemed it unsafe for guests to make use of the whirlpool/spa/etc during the repairs. We were told the repairs were being completed on the day of our checkout. The Rosedale offers free day newspapers in the lobby. If you want serious shopping, head for the Metropolis Plaza (450 stores). There are coupons in the hotel lobby brochure rack for the mall. $10 coupons (one per person)are redeemable at the mall customer service desk for spending in any store. They also give you a nifty shoulder bag. We used our thirty dollars in coupons for a $50 footwear purchase at Sportschek. You need a car or skytrain for the mall trip as it is 10 kilometres distant. But it is a really nice shopping experience. The concierge service at the hotel is a bit uneven. Andrew is terrific. But not everyone was at his level. When we checked out, and were departing the lobby, the concierge at the desk half a foot from the big double glass doors made no effort to open the door for our luggage-laden party of two. Even an au revoir would have been nice. Admittedly it was 7 a.m., and the concierge seemed sleepy, and perhaps was at the end of a long night-shift. The hotel is near one of the 20 stops of a citywide bus tour called \"Hop-on Hop-off.\" If you plan your day right, it's great value at $38C pp. You can stop at any point, at any time of the day. We \"hopped off\" at beautiful Stanley Park, and had a great lunch at Stanley Park's Grill. The Vancouver Aquarium is in the park. Admission is $28C for adults, and a few bucks cheaper for kids. The bus sells discounted aquarium tickets. The Rosedale has one restaurant. We tried \"Rosie's\" for dinner, and enjoyed the Onion Soup. Other patrons seemed impressed with their entrees. But at this restaurant and other eateries, we experienced \"sticker shock.\" Fish and Chips can easily cost $18C, a bit pricy for us Maritimers. Beer, wine, and liquor is also more expensive. Another good \"hopping off\" point on foot or bus is Canada Place, where cruiseships and float planes abound. Nearby is the restored Pan Pacific Railway building. We did a great lunch there at the Rogue Kitchen and Wet Bar. Terrific menu, thirty varieties of draft on tap, and an ambiance missing in many of the countless street restaurants. This is where many of the \"suits\" do lunch. So you know it's good. If you want to stick close to the hotel, a five minute stroll puts you in Yaletown, where we enjoyed home-made thick burgers and beer served by friendly staff at \"Earl's.\" If you go to Whistler, consider the \"Peak-to-Peak.\" Breath-taking views, and a ride to be remembered, especially for the non-skiing summer crowd. We saw three black bears from the safe vantage point of our gondola. Wait for one of the two silver gondolas. Each has a partial glass floor. The ride costs $44C pp, $33C after 4 p.m. Overall We recommend Aviawest Rosedale at Robson for affordability and location. Now if only that darn concierge could be more affable...
