If you travel outside of rush hour, you'll be in central Los Angeles or West Hollywood in 20 minutes.It's a little bit off the beaten path, and in no way a \"hip\" area, and therein lies its character. Across the street there is a shopping plaza, and a large grocery store that caters mostly to Mexican folks. I went in there several times for various things (including some tasty bakery treats) and people there were friendly. There's a CVS pharmacy a couple blocks away, and the legendary In & Out Burger is represented about four blocks south. Across the street is a Burger King and a McDonald's is abut 2 blocks north. Now, I read a review here were someone wrote they ate at the McDonald's and scurried back. Ummm, ok....this is not the kind of McDonald's you might visit in Ames, Iowa or some suburb where everything is squeaky clean. The neighborhood is working class, a bit gritty, perhaps, but if some reviewers think of the area as \"ghetto\", as one person wrote, I would say, dear sir, you are quite paranoid. In the day, you see all kinds of people out. Single women at bus stops, moms with kids and strollers, etc. At night, you're not going to see so many people walking around, And because it's a major city, you obviously want to always be aware of your surroundings. One of the great things about L.A. is the food trucks. Every night, one parked at the shopping center across the street. My wife and two of our kids walked from the hotel to the truck a couple of times and came back with great tasting food that was cheap. I swear, I'd stay in this hotel again just to hit up that food truck every night. They had the best tacos I had in L.A. One night around 9 pm I had to walk to the CVS pharmacy a couple of blocks way. Would I want my wife to do that? No, of course not, but that's common sense. I walked it and didn't ever feel threatened. but I grew up in Chicago and I'm not going to think I'm in danger if I see a cigarette butt in the curb or see a homeless guy nodding off on a bus stop bench. Parking was never an issue. One reviewer wrote you had to leave your keys with the front desk or some kind of parking valet, but that wasn't my experience. I found the area quite interesting. it is not the glitzy L.A. of the Strip, or as cool as West Hollywood. Walking around the area in the morning, I found mostly small, modest homes of working class folks. There's no cool clubs or coffeeshops. In other words, the yuppies haven't got to it yet and it's authentic. The rooms were clean, spacious, a good spot to sleep for the night, or just put the TV on and zone out. No noise from the streets drifted in. Breakfast was a lot better than other similar hotels I have stayed in. Eggs, waffles, fruit, muffins, yogurt, juice, coffee... I'd suggest at night, go out to the pool area. Pull up a plastic chair, have a glass of wine and chill. Watch the neighborhood, the cars going by, the people coming away from the taco truck, the shoppers at Superior Grocers. This is a part of L.A. that most visitors don't see.

The underground garage is a valet arrangement because cars can be double parked in the deep spaces, so you have to give up your key to the front desk if you block someone in - or get them to move a car if one parks behind you. It's an odd setup, but it was no problem to get a car moved. About our room - it was a suite with two queens and a sofa bed. Plenty of space for four of us, but with all that room the TV (a single older 24\" tube model) is hard to see from either end of the room.

Univeral Studios is actually 3.9 miles away...so not exactly down the road, but overall convenient to the freeways and for all access to SoCal.", "Date": "April 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for the price\u201d", "Author": "TravelSnob1", "ReviewID": "UR26474941", "Content": "HOTEL REVIEW # 163 Residence Inn Sacramento MY TRAVEL STYLE: If possible, I try to stay away from business hotels and strongly prefer resorts that resemble the Four Seasons, Aman, and Oberoi but try to find similar properties at lower cost. I seek out the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd experiences and I encourage you to view hotels I have stayed at and their respective reviews (by clicking on my name). Clearly this hotel is not in this category but it may be one of the best in the valley. LOCATION: Many restaurants around althought the area is a bit sketchy at night. Close access to the freeway. TYPE OF ROOM: Junior suite. BED/SHEETS/PILLOW; Soft but not luxurious. Everything was better than average but nothing special. Pillows were nice, soft down. LIGHTING: Lighting in room could have been brighter. Bathroom is good. BATHROOM/SHOWER: Shower has curved curtain rod so the curtain doesnt stick to your leg.... a big plus. Water pressure was low to medium. Bathroom was well appointed for the price of the room TOILETRIES: Fine but nothing special. CLEANLINESS: .Room and hotel was spotless. A/C: Never used. CLOSET SPACE: Good amount of space but probably too small for 2 people to unpack most items STYLE OF ROOM: Comfortable but lacking style. Carpet on the floors. COMMON AREA: Not a place to hang out. Just check in and eat breakfast. QUIET/MORNING LIGHT: Our room was quiet although we could hear noises from a house next door. All morning sunlight could be blocked with the curtain FOOD: Breakfast is included and there is a choice of 4 cereals, waffles, juices, toasts. TV/INTERNET: .TV is tube style and has many channels. Internet is wired and wireless at n/c and is fast. SERVICE:. Staff were over the top nice. Very impressed for the low price of this hotel SUMMARY: If you need to be in this area, this is probably the best choice for quiet, comfort, and convenience. Be sure to try out one of the best sushi restaurants in LA that is just a 5 minute drive away called Chiba (and I am super picky and dislike nearly all sushi restaurants). I recommend staying at this hotel", "Date": "March 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "babygirl96", "Title": "\u201cGirls day At Universal Studios\u201d", "Author": "babygirl96", "ReviewID": "UR22767890", "Content": "Well I took my 7 year old to universal studios for her birthday me and a girl friend, we made it a road trip, we got to the hotel at 9:00pm after a long day at universal studios (with 2 kids) the clerk was very nice (lobby was nice ) room was big, bathroom was huge and very nice we both had forgot toothpaste and called down and the front desk gave us a trial size for free.Bed was very comfortable and we had lots of pillows.

For the price, the hotel should have had a microwave and/or refrigerator. Their pool (which we did not use) is located in an unusual place to say the least. Our window did not have a screen. We asked the clerk if it was safe to leave it open at night and he said he would not recommend it because *theoretically\"* someone could climb up or down to the overhang and well, you get the idea. Having said that, the hotel was great for the price--many places in LA worth more than this one are dumps, and almost all under $100 seem to be. The staff was very helpful (a couple were not all that helpful but tried to be), and the room was nice. Their free computer with internet access in the lobby area was a bonus (kind of slow, but how many motels even offer this service); I used it a few times for information. We had no parking issues as some have raised. Perhaps we were there at a slow week but there were plenty of spaces available. The neighborhood felt safe to us. I don't know how some posters here define safe, but there are far worse neighborhoods in Hollywood and I have stayed in much less safer-feeling areas before. I only saw one instance of what I assume was crime-related (one evening, a helicopter flying a few blocks from the hotel shining a spotlight on the ground) A great supermarket was conveniently located across the street which I went to every night for cooler ice. The best thing about the hotel was their continental breakfast. They had a lot of choices, of which I tried most in 4 mornings, and all the food was fresh and good. Loved the waffle-maker! Why can't more hotels/motels have breakfast that is more than a piece of fruit and plain toast.

And shortly after arriving, we quickly saw why. From the brand name, we had already been expecting 2-3 diamond standard service - which was fine with us. We weren't planning to spend a majority of our time at the resort. There are a couple things that should change though if they haven't already! Being that I work at a resort myself, I'm very careful to use my debit card to hold a reservation - I only did so after calling the property directly to confirm no deposit would be taken, which they confirmed. Upon arriving, I told the front desk agent I would like to use a different card than the one I used to hold the reservation with, which he said was fine. I signed the registration form with the new credit card information. Upon getting to my room, I called both my credit card used and debit card to check the balances on both - I had over $250 holding on both cards! I'm very aware that additional money is usually held for parking, resort fees, incidentals, etc - but I had specifically asked for my debit card not to be charged! I walked back to the front desk and asked for them to reverse the charge, which the agent said he had already done - and that it's up to the bank now to release it. Again, I work at a front desk myself - after asking him to please call the authorization center and to reverse the authorization using his merchant number, he said he couldn't do it and that only a manager could - and the next manager wouldn't be there until the day of my departure. This was a horrible start to 3 days, since the money in my checking was what I would be using for food, recreation etc. Had it been held only on the debit card, I would have used my credit card - but he was holding both! That's near $500 I couldn't use! I told him he should do his best to fix it himself or to call his manager, as I wouldn't be paying for his mistake. Shortly after we had settled in and unpacked everything, the fire alarm system went off. Assuming it could be serious, we picked up everything we could grab (after just unpacking it) and ran down the stairs. We were stuck outside of the hotel for roughly 45 minutes before it was clear to go back in. We went to the concert that evening, and came back to find there were no parking spaces available. This upset me because we're paying for daily parking, and either 1) there aren't enough spaces to accomodate all guests, or 2) someone is bringining additional cars, which hurts both the employees and the guests. There was a parking space blocked off with traffic cones, which I removed myself - I was not going to pay someone else for overnight parking when I was already paying that to the hotel! Beds were very comfortable - A/C was a bit loud. The next morning, took a shower - very refreshing, strong pressure - until the hot water went out! Day of departure - hotel included continental breakfast. The bagels and muffins were stale! We ended up going to Denny's before driving home. It's good that my boyfriend and I have humor, because most of these things were pretty funny in restrospect - but I left comments with the manager - so hopefully, your future stay there is more enjoyable!

We had 2 suites booked (apparently there are only 4 in the whole place?) and when we walked in, everything seemed pretty new. Dark wood furniture, fairly modern decor and the white shutters were a nice touch. The suite was very spacious: 2 queen sized beds, a sofa bed that was separated by a tiny half wall (no distinct separation here), a desk, and a small table. We had 4 adults in the room with ample space. Housekeeping did a great job of maintaining the cleanliness. Free Wi-Fi was great. The place is about a 15 minute drive from Universal Studios and the breakfast room is bright and cheery in the morning with the sun coming through the tall windows. Breakfast is continental, includes fruit, waffles, baked goods, coffee/milk/juice...a good amount for what is needed. Garage is definitely too small for the amount of guests there when we visited.
