The bed is a little too soft for me. The only low rating I give is to the front desk. I called in the morning for early check-in. The room was not ready so the front desk asked for a phone number so they can call me when the room is ready. They never called. At check-in , I asked why no one call and let me know the room was ready? No answer. I reserved a King Studio room but I entered a King 1-bedroom. I called the front desk to ensure they gave me the correct room so they won't charge me extra.

We stayed in the south building in a studio suite. We had a king sized bed and a pull out sofa bed where our son slept. The room had a full (well, almost full - no oven) kitchen with all the dishes and glassware we needed. The room and the whole property were clean and nicely decorated. The hotel provided breakfast and dinner on the weeknights during our stay. We only ate the dinner twice, but both times the food was decent. It was nice to have that option so we didn't have to go out and spend money on dinner at a restaurant. The location of the hotel was perfect for us, as it was close to all of the sites we'd planned on seeing during our trip (Sea World, the Zoo, USS Midway and the beach) and there were many stores (Trader Joe's, VONS, Target) close by so that we could pick up anything we needed. There is also a walking path along the water with a huge park right behind the property. The park had a really nice playground with a toddler friendly area that our son enjoyed playing on. Lastly, even though the hotel was very close to the airport, we hardly heard any airplane noise and we even slept with our window open at night.

The hotel had a convenient breakfast each day and each room had a full kitchen that you could stock from the local Vons located just blocks away. The beds were super comfortable and the rooms were very clean. It was a great place for a family of five or six to stay because of the availability of two bedroom suites. As other travelers have pointed out the first floor is not too desirable, because you feel like you are in the middle of the parking lot, but the higher floors are nice and you can get a glimpse of the water from most balconies. We moved from a first floor room to a third floor room when it became available and the hotel made the move very easy by moving all of our belongings for us and having the new key ready at the desk when we returned from sightseeing. The staff are very accommodating and helpful. One of the desk staff spent about 10 minutes giving me the low down on the different beaches in the San Diego area. His advice was spot on. It was especially helpful that he mentioned that Blacks Beach is a nude beach when I asked which beach in La Jolla would be best. That would have been a little hard to explain to the kids... The Cove with happy sunning seals and sea lions was a much better fit. We would return to this Homewood Suites.

The hotel is located in a shopping plaza that has many dining options within walking distance. This allowed us to return our rental car a day early and walk to dinner. We took advantage of the free airport shuttle in the morning to get us to the airport. They run every half hour, but you do need to reserve a spot during the heavy departure times. There is a little business center that has two computers for general use and they allow free printing. This comes in handy to check in for you flights and print your boarding passes. There is also free wifi in the public areas and the rooms. There is free breakfast, but we could not take advantage because we had an early flight. There is a pool and hot tub\u2026some folks were enjoying them when we walked by, but it was pretty cold the day we were there so we passed on that. We checked out there two small exercise rooms and they had good equipment. Nobody was using them when we were there. The room was great. We were in 361 which overlooked the basketball court and a nicely landscaped courtyard area. We had a little balcony and enjoyed having the window open for fresh air in the evening. There is a full kitchen with pots, pans, and utensils. There was a full sized refrigerator, stove, microwave, dishwasher, toaster, and coffee maker. They give you some packets of coffee, sugar, tea, microwave popcorn, salt, and pepper. You need to bring everything else. There was a dining table, a writing desk, a couch, and a large bed. There was plenty of drawer and bathroom space for our stuff and also plenty of outlets to charge our ever growing list of gadgets. There was an outside deck for relaxing on our floor also. The area is nice to walk around. You are right by the water, but not the ocean itself. It is a waterway for boats and you can walk along the banks. There is a 1/3 scale navy ship in the parking lot called the USS Recruit. It was used to train new Navy recruits in shipboard procedures. It holds the distinction of being the only commissioned Naval vessel to never reach the water. There are plenty of dining options within a short walk I saw pizza, Subway, Starbucks, a Greek place, and a Thai place. We had dinner at the Thai place, Spices Bay Thai Kitchen, and really enjoyed our meal and the friendly staff. We enjoyed our stay and would use this hotel again, especially on our arrival or departure nights.

Anyone who's stayed in a Homewood Suites before will enjoy this location, especially with its outdoor patios and waterfront location. The variety of restaurants within a very short walk is also a plus. I was pleasantly surprised that although the hotel is close to the airport, noise from planes was not an issue, even on the fourth floor. My rating is four stars rather than five for two reasons: 1) The price seems high in comparison to other Homewood Suites we've stayed at, and 2) You pay the same price whether you get a waterfront view or not.

This place is one of my favorite hotels to stay as they always make me feel like at home. I\u2019m currently on an extended stay and am blown away by how the staff continues to go above and beyond to ensure guests have a great stay. The place is in fantastic condition and the staff performs maintenance and upkeep constantly. One night the pool table got destroyed and it was replaced two days later. The bbq grills are cleaned everyday and the staff will light them for you if needed and provided utensils. Every encounter I have with the staff has been very pleasant. My luggage was stored upon arrival while they were preparing my room. I went to get it and could not carry it all and went to make another trip when the lady from the front desk jumped in and brought it to me. The cleaning team is very efficient and pretty stealthy. I reluctantly single out people when the entire staff is great. In this case I have to say the entire food team went above and beyond to accommodate. One example is the eggs were not good for a long time because the way they were prepared (steamed). One of the new employees took the initiative to fry them in a pan and add a little garnish. They were like a totally different product and were very delicious. I spoke to him and found out he actually went to the Courtyard hotel next door (opened by the same company) to use their pan. Marten and Stephanie who work the dinner/happy hour are very friendly and quite efficient. They do an excellent job keeping things stocked and cleaned and are always friendly. The hotel is a great location as others have noted. All the amenities of this place make it a great deal but the STAFF makes this place special. They are very proud of their Trip Advisor Award and continually strive to please everyone. It is very obvious the management and entire team are focused on delivering a great hotel stay for all guests!

First is location -- it's extremely convenient to the airport and most of the attractions as well. There is also a Trader Joes and Vons within less than a half mile -- almost walking distance. The location on the esplanade park and walkway is wonderful, with bayfront/estuary views and a huge walking/biking pathway right outside the door and a huge park there too. Its in a quiet safe neighborhood with the only sound disturbances being the planes taking off, because of the proximity to the airport. The rooms have a nice almost full kitchen -- full size fridge, dishwasher, microwave, 2 burner range and no oven. There is a nice large granite type counter area that is very convenient for food preparation and a small dining table with 2 chairs in our one bedroom unit. There's a nice little balcony with one chair on it -- for a little reading or coffee in the sunshine. There are two LG flatscreen TVs -- one in the living room and one in the bedroom that are quite adequate. The fold out couch in the living room is smallish and the cushions are showing some age related compression, but it was still comfortable. There's a worktable with ergonomic chair and easy web access stuff and outlets that are efficient and comfortable. The bed linens are soft and comfortable, there are a wide variety of pillows available. The toilet paper is Cottonelle -- so it's nice and soft, not the single ply sandpaper stuff that many places are trying to offer now, and the toiletries are very nice Neutrogena products. The business center computers are antiquated and slow and pretty much only useful for printing out boarding passes. The laundry is large and bright with plenty of machines that are modern and do a good job. My husband enjoyed the exercise equipment that included a treadmill, elliptical, stationary bike, free weights and a weight machine - drinking fountains and a TV were available in the workout room. The gardens and outdoor areas were extensive, well landscaped and maintained.. There was quite a variety of outdoor seating available, with many areas having gas fireplaces in the seating areas. There were several outdoor grills available for guest use that were modern, clean and ready to go. The breakfast and dinner offerings are adequate - but not gourmet. You get hot filling food, but it's just kind of average. Standard make your own waffles, bagels, english muffins, etc, - three \"hot offerings\" which usually are eggs, sausage and tater tots -- the best of which is the tater tots, and a fruit and yogurt bar that has canned peaches, canned mandarins, cottage cheese and yogurt, and some fresh melon chunks. Evening offerings are a nice enough salad bar, and a hot offering that has been during our stay - edible, but mostly because it's included. There's drinkable wine and beer and with the nice pool table and fireplace area, it offers a nice opportunity to unwind after the day. I found the staff to be friendly and responsive, even when our flight was delayed. The cleaning staff is polite, unobtrusive and efficient. The hotel offers very good rates, with nice discounts for government and AAA and they participate in the HH points program. It is a family oriented hotel, so there will be kids at breakfast, in the pool, etc.... and, of course, their behavior is up to their parents ... but we had no problem with noise. Overall - the best place to stay in SanDiego if you're not looking for night life, excitement etc. If you want a great convenient location, nice facilities, large room, kitchen facilities, and the open air experience -- with just a few minutes to the zoo, SeaWorld, Balboa park, airport and downtown -- no parking fees, no internet fees, and a safe place where you and your kids can stretch out and run around....

The hotel is in a beautifully developed small mixed residential/cultural/small business neighborhood that was formerly a naval training station. You are in the city without the noise and traffic of an urban area. Many amenities within easy (1/2 mile) walking distance, including a great little supermarket (Von's); a good selection of restaurants, cafes. Everything else we wanted to do--Zoo, Balboa Park, Coronado, beaches--was in easy (10-15 min) driving distance. We had a king suite in the south building, facing the water, with a small balcony. I'd highly recommend the latter two options. There are two L shaped buildings--the north building surrounds the pool and the south building the basketball court. Suite was beautiful, large, very clean, nicely decorated, with an open plan, overlooking the boat channel and walking path. There is a large outdoor terrace at each building. The laundry was a welcome amenity and had front & top loading washer options. Our room was quiet and we were never bothered by noise from other guests or rooms on either side. Yes, there are planes overhead, but we did not find this an issue at the hotel. There are a LOT of planes in San Diego, and we found everywhere we went, every beach, every park, every attraction, had planes overhead. Some great things I didn't expect--there is a (free!) shopping service....just fill out a slip with what you need & hotel staff will pick it up. The evening 'receptions' (M-Th) were full dinners (we enjoyed chicken teriyaki; roast chicken; taco night--skipped the salisbury steak night) and surprisingly good. The breakfast was a cut above the usual hotel fare in both quality and quantity. My daughter, a hotel waffle connoisseur, found the 'make your own' here the best she's had. Staff was unfailingly wonderful. Everyone we encountered had a pleasant greeting. Everyone seemed happy and all were helpful, from the shuttle driver to housekeeping and everyone in between. If you have any forgotten necessities, the front desk will send them up free of charge (we forgot to pack a razor; they brought up some with a small can of shave cream, gratis, even though you could buy similar items in their small pantry/store).

They have both kinds of suites, what I would call 'real suites' (door between rooms) and 'fake suites' (no door between rooms, but still called a suite). We booked a 'real' one so we could watch TV after the kids went to sleep. The rooms run a bit on the small size (e.g, a bit downzided from an Embassy Suites, but you are paying less, too, so no problem), but they are not overly cramped. Rooms were immaculately clean.

We had a great experience! I called the morning of our arrival to request 1) room near our friends 2)both rooms having a bay view. They said that they couldn't promise anything because it was a busy weekend, but that they would do their best. Sure enough - our rooms were great. We were 2 doors down from our friends, and we had a corner room with the living room window looking over the courtyard and the bedroom window with a clear view of the bay. Our friends were given a handicap room but wanted to have a bathtub so requested to move. They were very quick to help them move, so they lost their view - but ended up closer to us. And they ended up hanging out in our room most of the time so they didn't miss out on much. Their only complaint about their room was that they didn't get ESPN... but we did. They had a studio suite so I don't know if that makes a difference, but the guy was a little bummed...very minor issue though. It's in a great location, right on a bay, and there are plenty of eating places (Starbucks, Subway, Oggis Pizza) within walking distance, and then just a 3 minute drive away other food and grocery stores (Trader Joes, Vons, Five Guys Burgers). We were in a 1 bedroom suite and it was perfect. The decorations felt fresh and new. And everything was clean and in great condition. There was a flat screen TV in the living room and in the bedroom. The shower and toilet are separated from the sink which is a factor I really appreciate in a hotel. It's nice to be able to do my make-up or hair while someone else can use the shower or toilet. The bed was a little too soft for our preferences - but that's just a matter of personal opinion. Having the one-bedroom suite is great though because we could close the door on the mess and still have our friends over. The kitchen was well stocked (plates, cups, bowls, mixing bowls, flatware, etc) and had a full size fridge. There was a 2 burner stove, dishwasher and microwave as well. (housekeeping washed out dishes while we were out - which was also great!) Only thing we missed was a blender for mixed drinks but again... minor, minor issue. The breakfast was definitely better than other included breakfasts I've been to. We were only there for two mornings but each morning was different. The first morning was eggs, bacon and tater tots, and the second morning was chorizo, regular eggs, tortillas and sausage. Both mornings they also had 4 waffle stations going, cinnamon rolls, fresh and canned fruit, yogurt, cottage cheese, oatmeal and cereal. Also had a few juice and coffee options. Ultimately - very satisfying. We weren't there for any of the free dinners, but they post a menu on your fridge and options looked great! I used the running path one morning that goes along the water and it was well-maintained and pretty. I also used the fitness room (there are 2 but I only used the one in the south building) and it was clean, up to date and well stocked (a few hand weights, bench, 2 treadmills, 1 eliptical, an ab thing, several exercise balls, some medicine balls, a step, yoga mat and probably other things) We also didn't get a chance to use it, but their outdoor patio with a fire pit also looked very inviting. The pool and jacuzzi were also great. It was unseasonably warm weather for January so we were actually able to lay out by the pool and get some sun. They had plenty of towels and great, comfy lounge chairs. You need to use your room key-card to access the pool and any of the main buildings which I appreciate. It just adds another sense of safety and comfort. Ultimately we could not have asked for anything more in a hotel. It was a great price (especially for San Diego) and the inclusions (free parking, free wi-fi, free breakfast, free week night dinner) was all just above and beyond any other hotel in the area. When I was first looking for a hotel I was considering the gaslamp district so we'd be \"close to action\" but am so so so glad we went with the Homewood Suites. It was maybe a 10 minute drive to any of the places we wanted to go - and being by the water at such a great location was absolutely perfect.

We went out for the day and the room was ready with all our stuff in when we returned including all the stuff from the fridge and freezer and the rollaway bed. There was no charge for the rollaway during the entire stay. The suites are spacious, the maid service excellent. We sat out each morning in the courtyard to eat breakfast. Its 5 minutes from the airport so you hear the planes going over when you are o/s but no noise from them in the rooms. Breakfast was more than adequate, always eggs and some kind of meat, waffles, oatmeal, yogurt, fresh fruit, cinammon buns and muffins, tea, coffee, juice. Dinner 4 nights a week the menu is posted on the fridge in your room was varied and always they were filling up when things got low. It saved us a ton of money that we could then spend on trips. Beer and wine were complimentary. We used the barbecues in the courtyard one night, the pool was great and so was the hot tub. Staff were extremely friendly and i had no complaints about anything. Used the business centre to check emails and would definitely stay here again.

We booked one of the two bedroom suites. I am currently a Hilton HHonors Gold member. Location: Finding the hotel was pretty easy, as it was located in Liberty Station, a relatively new development west of the airport. There are a lot of walking/jogging paths and green areas right next to the hotel. The harbor itself is also close by. There are a cluster of restaurants across from the hotel parking lot. If you go for a drive, you can get to a Trader Joe's and Vons in about 2-3 minutes. SeaWorld and Mission Beach are about 10 minutes away. Check-In: We arrived a bit early (3:45pm), so our room was not ready yet. On that note, we were able to check-in online the day before and pick the exact room that we wanted. We opted for a 4th floor (high floor) room in the south building. Hilton Gold HHonors benefits included 2 bottles of water and a 4-pack of Milano cookies. Not bad. The front desk staff was very friendly and efficient. Room: The general condition of the hotel is excellent. It appears to have been built in the past few years. Our particular two bedroom suite had nice furnishings. One room had a king bed and the other had a queen bed. Each bedroom had its own full bathroom. The king bedroom had access to an outdoor balcony with a good view facing north. During our stay, we could see the nightly fireworks at SeaWorld from our room. In between the two bedrooms was a living room/kitchen area. There was plenty of space here. Some of the previous reviews mention the loud air conditioner. Yes, I can see what they mean when it cycles on/off. However, a good trick is to keep the a/c on \"fan\" mode. This keeps the fan blower on constantly, so when the compressor actually kicks in, it won't be as noticeable. Amenities: The property has a pool by the north building and a sport court (basketball court) by the south building. The gym was small but had your normal range of equipment. There are laundry facilities. We had the free breakfast buffet each morning. It was generally a good combination of hot and cold foods. Typical choices included scrambled eggs, meat (sausage or bacon), hash browns, waffles, breads, fruit, cereals, etc. We tried the complimentary dinner on one of the nights. The menu for that night consisted of orange chicken (drumsticks/thighs cooked in an orange sauce) with salad and couscous on the side. Rolls and beverages (wine, lemonade, water) were available. It wasn't anything spectacular, but it was free. Service: The housekeeping staff did a great job and we had no issues. The other staff in the hotel are friendly and helpful. There appears to be a hotel shuttle van that goes to/from the airport. Overall we had a wonderful experience here. The price was a little on the high side, but it was the summer season, so it was expected.

While the front desk person apologised, we felt it needed to be dealt with with more than just an apology. This was a pretty gross thing to find.

Although these stations tend to create a line because of the time it takes to make them, a young man that worked for the hotel offered to make waffles for people in line. He helped by making sure that the guests had waffles in the fastest way possible by making some in the kitchen. I did not get this service at the other Homewood that I stayed at. I was then called while in my room to offer me fresh towels. I appreciated the phone call because I did not want them to bring me new towels seeing as I was checking out that morning. I did not see the point in wasting towels and their call to offer them gave me the chance to let them know that I did not need them. Another hotel just brought me towels and wasted them because I was checking out in a matter of a few hours. I also loved the fact that the hotel was quiet. I did not hear any noise from planes, which I worried that I would. I am a light sleeper and had one of the best nights sleep. The location of the hotel is nice, it is close enough to downtown San Diego to make it convenient, but far enough away to make it not as busy and loud. I really enjoyed my stay here and will definitely be back to stay. Their service and location make it a perfect place to stay in San Diego.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "texas", "Title": "\u201cWanted to give it a 5 but.....\u201d", "Author": "ginger2007", "ReviewID": "UR115897918", "Content": "This was my second stay at this property. While I wanted so badly to give it another 5 star rating like I did 2 years ago, one thing kept me from it. But let's start with the good first. For starters, I was in San Diego for Comic Con so having a full breakfast provided each morning at no additional cost is always a good thing because you usually don't eat again until dinner. Aside from the powdered eggs, the breakfast is good - great oatmeal, breads, waffles, cereals and excellent coffee. The hotel is extremely clean at all times and that is refreshing as well. We had the 2 room, 2 bathroom suite which was very large and all three of us had our own TV! Parking is free and plentiful - we never have to search for parking there - and it's always near the front. A bonus was in finding out that the Comic Con shuttle was actually making a stop that far out this year too so that kept parking costs down. Location is nice too - grocery store for the full kitchen ( which includes all the dishes, utensils, pots, pans, toaster, fridge and two burner stove) and several restaurants are nearby, some within walking distance. Now for the not so good. The pillows in our room were very small and thin - I had to use the decorative pillow actually - it had more meat to it. We had made this reservation in July of 2010, anticipating Comic Con, and we ended up with a handicap room. I can't stand handicap rooms - I'm not handicap and like to have a bathtub, not a shower with no sides to it and a toilet you have to climb onto (I'm short). That really irritated me that they would give me a room like that when I had made the reservation a year early. But the worst thing that happened was that when I checked in, their new computer system did not take into account that I had paid a portion of my bill already and they held several hundred dollars hostage. Then, when they tried to fix it, they ended up holding $2000 for a $727 hotel bill. I went to use my card at Comic Con and couldn't. We couldn't get food or anything. But Cydney at the Homewood - bless her heart - came to our rescue and brought us money for dinner - she actually delivered it to me and we had a wonderful dinner and the $2000 hold was removed as well for our use later. I know this was a glitch in their computer system but it did make us extremely nervous throughout our stay because we never knew if they were going to hold more. They did fix it and made amends but it was a very big inconvenience for that one day when we couldn't use our card for anything.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midland,Mi.", "Title": "\u201cNice location\u201d", "Author": "dnrdavies", "ReviewID": "UR115891954", "Content": "We loved the location of this Homewood.

The email said that their cleaning folks found out some scratches on the chairs and he went ahead and placed $80 charges on my credit card. After I read the email, I started to remember my daughter's comments when we checked in that late afternoon. Our daughter is 3.5 and what I would consider a very well behaved child and gets along well with her peers and listens to adults. I had to use the chair for her to stand near the sink so she could wash her hands before we headed out for the free dinner. I pulled the chair out from under the diner table in living room and carried it to the sink in bedroom. Before she climbed up, she noticed those marks. She asked me who drew those and I told her I did not know. She said it could be babies. To be frankly, I did not notice the marks at all until she pointed out. I did not bother to call front desk to report that as I thought that should be already knew by the hotel. So after I got the email, I called the assistant manager and told him the truth. He just said he did not have power to revert the charges and we had to talk to his manager. So we left a VM for his manager. Then it took the manager five days to get back to us by email and said his investigation was marks happened during our occupancy. He did not even leave his signature with title and phone number so that we could try to discuss this further over the phone. Anyway, I replied to his email right away and explained the situation to him again but till now a week passed, no answer from him. I think the management is NOT professional at all.

Me, my wife, 9 year old son and 6 year old daughter were here for Spring Break to attend theme parks and other attractions. Homewood Suites is now our favorite family-friendly hotel!! Embassy Suites is now our second favorite. We read the reviews here on T.A., so we booked a room at HS and were thrilled. We payed $175/night, are Silver HHonors members, and booked directly from their website (no 3rd party like expedia, hotwire, etc). The suites may seem expensive at first, but with their amenities, you can save a lot of money in other ways. Try and use AAA rate or Govt rate (if possible) when booking on the website. Our room was on the second floor in the North Building with a view of the pool and the bay! We had the one bedroom suite. The kids slept on the sofa bed which pulled out just fine and we slept on the king sized bed. There was a full size stainless steel refrigerator, stainless steel microwave, stainless steel dishwasher, and electric range with 2 burner locations. The kitchen counter tops were granite. Wi-Fi was complimentary and our Blackberries connected no problem. There were 2 flat screen HDTVs. Parking is \"self-park\" and is free. Breakfast is included every morning (7 days a week) and dinner is included (Monday-Thursday only). The wine was Sycamore Lane (red and white) and Bud Light was served from the tap. The pool and hot tub were heated well. There is a nice walkway behind the hotel which leads to a playground. There's a Trader Joe's and Vons about a mile away. House keeping was great! I recommend waiting until 4pm to check in and/or returning to the room for the evening because the suites take more time for housekeeping to turn over. You can hear the airplanes flying over head during the day, but at night it didn't matter because from 10pm to 6am, the planes cannot land or take off.

One thing that I was shock for being charge was for using the telephone for a local call. If I had known, I would have used my cell phone. The one thing that was a big disappointment was the cheap quality of this building's structure. You can hear people open and close doors, closet doors, walk, etc. from the people above you. And the people below you can hear you as well. If you are a light sleeper, stay on the fourth floor or go somewhere else.

There are a few restaurants near the hotel within walking distance, or you can take advantage of complimentary breakfasts and dinners. There is also a nice jogging trail next to the hotel that some friends of mine used and enjoyed. We selected a place with a kitchenette so that we could cook food at the hotel and then take lunches to the zoo, Seaworld, etc. There were grills outdoors that we used to make burgers and kebabs, which was a lot of fun and a low-priced alternative to having every vacation meal at a restaurant. There is a Trader Joe's grocery a few blocks away. Lots of families and their children stay here, making those complimentary meals a bit crowded. However, the rooms and halls were typically quiet, the staff was extremely courteous, cheery and helpful at all hours, and the rooms were well-appointed with comfortable beds and enough kitchen supplies and utensils to make whatever is necessary. The shower was not particularly effective, but we had the handicapped-accessible room, and through no fault of the hotel those showerheads are typically not very good anyway if you need some pressure. The (heated!) pool and hot tub are small, but still in keeping with the average hotel at this price range. There is some disparity between what wares and utensils are in each room, but the front desk can get you anything that is missing or extra containers to take, say, a big bowl of pineapple to the beach.

The layout is similar to LA but on a smaller scale with less traffic and you don't want to be without a car in San Diego. It is not like San Francisco. Our longest drive was about 20 min or so to get to La Jolla, took about 10 min or so to get to the Zoo/Balboa, less than that to get to the seaport/USS Midway area and about 15 min or so to get to Point Loma/Cabrillo. We would have rated this place five stars but the only thing that brought the rating down for me was that there was a hint of a cigarette scent inside of our room but not outside. We were in a non smoking room but maybe the smoking section was on the same floor as us. The air was a little stale and my husband's allergies worsened a bit in the room. It might have been the ventilation system, and there might have been some dust in it. As for the room itself, it was very clean.

Parking was free and it as just a short drive into downtown or a ~$20 cab ride away (which can be called by the front desk). This place would be perfect If it was walking distance to gaslamp. There is free internet in the room, but was kinda slow as in most hotels. The free breakfast had a good selection of food including fresh juices and coffee. The hotel actually had alot of amenities(pool, bbq, fitness center, pool table, bball court) I wish I was able to use, only if my trip was more than 1 night. I must also note that my girlfriend left her purse in a drawer after we checked-out and thought she lost it. However, the hotel took the time to call me and let me know she left it and that we could pick it up. They have very honest housekeeping! Check-out was as easy as a phone call to the front desk.

The 2 bedrooms were connected by a compact sitting room and a decently equipped kitchen. Because we were only there for 1 night, we didn't use the cooking facilities. However we did want to get ice and even though I searched high and low, I couldn't find an ice bucket. I ended up walking to the ice machine to collect ice with a saucepan from the cupboard. This was no big deal but on my return,I met a guy going the other way to collect ice also carrying a pan so it didn't seem to be an isolated omission for our room. It's a bit strange these are not supplied but as I say, it's no big deal. As others have commented, the'free' evening reception meal with wine and beer for the adults is of excellent quality but because the hotel was full the night we were there, there wasn't enough tables to seat all the guests. Since you were not allowed to take alcohol out of the dining area, we had to rutun later in the evening in order to get a table to eat. In the morning, it was the same story. The dining area was very full with some big parties cramped around some very small tables. The breakfast was good and plentiful but nothing exceptional. Although both the evening meal, breakfast and parking are 'free', don't be fooled into thinking that Hilton haven't baked these costs into the room rate. The night we spent at the Homewood Suites was the most expensive (in rate terms) of all the 18 nights we spent on the West coast and that included staying in some city centre hotels in places like San francisco.

The front desk provided a map and directions to the zoo and the lady in the manager's reception area helped me wrap up some dinner items to take back to the room for my family. The most outstanding service was when a couple of the engineering staff helped clean beach sand out of my rental car.

Airplanes regularly take off over the hotel area, but the sound in the rooms is minimal. The pool is a little on the small side, but was the perfect temperature and plenty of fun for the boys and some new friends.

Overall, a very well done property with no major complaints. Within a 10 minute drive to most major attractions (downtown, Sea World, Maritime Museum, Balboa Park) and all can be reached with an easy non-highway route. Minutes from the airport. There is a central check-in and dining building that is flanked by the two \u201clodging\u201d buildings. Both lodging buildings appear virtually identical and are four floors high. The only difference is that the \u201cNorth\u201d building is 100% non-smoking. There is a very short outdoor walk from either building to the central dining area. Access to the lodging buildings is under 24 hour key card restriction. Rooms are generally well-insulated. Room doors were well engineered \u2013 none of the typical slamming door syndrome so common at many properties. Although close to the typical departing flight path from airport, the in-room noise was not a problem as the AC unit has the ability to run in \u201cfan\u201d mode when not actively cooling. This covered up virtually all noise. With the \u201cfan\u201d mode off, we could definitely hear the rumble from departing jets. The only negative to the room insulation is between floors. We switched to the top floor after the first night due to the continual trampling sound from the occupants above us. AC unit did not do a good job moderating the temperature between the three rooms in our unit. The master bedroom (which was furthest from the AC unit) was significantly warmer than the other bedroom (which was closest to the AC unit). Given the significant amount of airflow that gets pumped through the one vent in each room, there was no good way to self-regulate the temperature. Trying to slow the airflow in the cooler room by closing the vent just resulted in the very loud sound of rushing air trying to make its way through a restricted vent opening. Very small exercise room is located in each building. Note that the facility only opens at 6:00 a.m. \u2013 not terribly convenient if one is not on Pacific Time. But, as the facility is located on the 3rd floor of each building, I suppose this reduces foot traffic noise in the morning for those residing on the 3rd floor. The free breakfast is generally well presented and is continually stocked by an attentive staff. After a week, it does get a bit old as there is not much variety from day-to-day, but the convenience makes it worthwhile. No trouble getting a table even during spring break time. Outdoor pool was heated and warm enough for kids to enjoy. Air temps were 68-72 degrees. Not a lap pool, but fine for kids to play.

I was woken up at 6:45am with the sound of the elliptical machine whirling noise. Then I could hear the people talking \"I've already done 2 miles\" and on with their conversation. I was very disappointed. The Exercise Room is open 6am-10pm, so beware. Other than that it was quiet, even though it is near the airport.

For a Homewood Suites/Residence Inn type of hotel, it is one of the nicer ones I have stayed in. The pros: 1. The hotel still feels brand new - not at all old or run-down. 2. The area surrounding the hotel also feels new - it looks like the whole area was redeveloped over the last few years, so there are newer restaurants and facilities nearby - not at all like the surrounding Point Loma area. 3. Free parking 4. Free breakfast buffets (kids loved this - waffles, eggs, the usual hot fare) 5. Free dinners (yes, free dinners - OK, it's institutional food - you are better off eating out, but there were plenty of people who seemed to love it) 6. It's about 3 minutes from the SAN terminal, but somehow doesn't feel like an \"airport hotel.\" 7. It has suites (i.e., real bedrooms) with separate living/dining room and kitchen with full sized refrigerator (also range top and microwave, but no oven). 8. Flat screen TVs. 9. Nice walking trail/lane next to hotel - seems safe 10. Comfortable beds and updated bathrooms 11. Free internet access, and free printers near lobby for internet/office 12. Had towels by the pool (why can't most hotels get this right?) The Cons: 1. Somewhat loud A/C unit in rooms - not easy to regulate temperatures in each separate room. 2. If you're next to the elevator (an -08 2BR suite), you hear it in the MBR. 3. You will need to drive to any SD tourist sites or downtown (but you'll need a car anywhere you stay in SD) 4. Not a luxury resort by any means - upscale dorm furniture in living areas, but functional 5. Not cheap compared to other nearby hotels 6. Pool somewhat small (but again, this is not a luxury resort) 7. Yes, you can hear airplanes sometimes (you are next to the airport, after all) 8. Limited TV selections - not full cable line-up (kids had no Nickelodeon, and you had to pay for Disney (?)) 9. Don't quite understand the sliding door to a 2 foot deep balcony - looks good at a distance, but practically useless. 10. Rooms are in two buildings not attached by indoor walkway to the lobby building - need to walk outside to get breakfast, etc. Not a big deal - only 20 feet or so. So in the end, we'd stay there again. Since we paid over $200/night for a 2BR suite, I would hope that non-spring break rates are lower.

It gets bogged down at some peak times, but over-all is the fastest I've every had in a hotel. Video conferencing with my daughter was better from the hotel than it was in our house testing it out before the trip. Yes, I'm saying that the hotel internet works better than my Comcast Broadband at home (some of the time). I don't watch TV, but there are two huge flat screen sets in my room. I think that they have premium channels beyond the norm as well. I am 100% happy with everything about this hotel. If I had to find flaws, I would say that the rooms could be a little bigger, as the king sized bed in my suite is kind of crammed in.

This hotel was similar to other Homewood Suites. I enjoyed my stay. However, there were a few things that I did not enjoy like the distance from places in SD and the noise. The Pros: Clean Hotel Close to Vons Grocery Store, Trader Joes, Starbucks, and numerous of restaurants Within walking distance to a park and playground for those with younger children Complimentary Breakfast Close to airport Free Parking and lots of spaces The Cons: Not that close to Mission Beach, downtown, and Balboa Park as I thought Not easily accessible to the highways-takes longer than you think to get to and from places The Noise-I could hear clearly what my neighbors next door where doing. Not something that you want to hear especially if you have young children trying to sleep Small Rooms-Compare to other HS that I've stayed at, I thought the rooms lack square footage and storage space. Make sure that if you are a family of 4 or more no matter how small your children are; get a two bedroom. The one bedroom suite was way too small for myself, my husband, my 3 year old, and 4 months old child. We felt cramped and we are all skinny and small people. Especially since you have to enter the bedroom to utilize the bathroom. I like how Hilton has their Embassy Suites laid out much better. Lack Of Space In Dining Area-there were never enough chairs and tables available for breakfast or dinner unless you were there before start time. Dining Area Location-The dining area is in a seperate building from the hotel rooms. So, it's a bit of an inconvenience if you have small children, want to take your food back to your room, or if you need to go back to your room for something. At other HS, I will just get my food and take it back to my room. This HS did not have any of those food containers for you to carry food back to your room...which would have helped because there were never enough spaces to eat in the dining area. I will recommend this hotel if you are doing things within the Point Loma area of San Diego. However, the location was quite a bit of distance to the places that we visited in San Diego. The next time we will stay in Hotel Circle like our previous trip. That location was easily accessible to highways, beaches, downtown, and Balboa Park.

There is a great evening walk to be had along the waterfront. Just across the parking lot is a small commercial centre with a range of restaurants. The hotel has a free evening meal (with free beer!!) from Mon-Thur. The quality is not amazing, but it certainly saved us a few $ on eating out. The rooms were a good size and clean. Good laundry facilities, exercise room and pool. Free wireless internet throughout the hotel. Cons Without doubt the noisiest hotel I've ever stayed in. It didn't start well when we were given a room for disabled people, without being told. Being 6'3\" I don't need sinks etc any lower than they already are. So, after trekking back to reception we got another room. The replacement room was next to the lift. It didn't appear to be a problem, until we went to bed. Our bedroom was right next to the lift shaft, and I don't know who was using the lift at 3am, but ti was certainly on the move throughout the night. The next day we moved room. The third room was much better. Although the final room we stayed in was quieter, it was still noisy for 3 reasons: 1) The hotel has no sound proofing. The people above could easily be heard walking around. Luckily they always stopped being noisy at a decent hour, so no complaints were necessary. 2) The hotel is almost right in the flight path for the airport. Not a massive problem as the planes seemed to stop taking off about 22:30, and didn't start again until about 6:30. 3) The absolute worst, and noisiest, thing was the air conditioning system. Each room has it's own system that feeds all the rooms in the suite. It's very noisy. This could be controlled within the suite by turning the temperature right up (stupidly there is no off switch!). However, due to the lack of sound proofing the air con systems of the suite above and below could be heard clearly, and when laying on the pillow the whole sound reverberated even more.

The kitchen was new and cleanl Hotel itself: Nice outdoor patio on the 3rd floor with awesome views and tables, chairs, and umbrellas. Great place to relax with a beer, but ... no beer allowed! My only complaint. Breakfast: included daily. The breakfast room was clean and welcoming, and the staff kept everything full. The food was better than continental, and definitely good to get you started. Waffles, eggs, bacon, toast, bagels, coffee, juice, etc. \"Light Dinner\": Monday through Thursday they serve a managers reception \"Light Dinner.\" We checked it out on Thursday, and it was great!

Front Desk : after the front desk experience it seems like it went downhill a bit. They were still helpful, just not quite as friendly, and maybe they were just overly busy. The Comic Con flooded the city! Area: you need a car to stay here! Free parking, though, so that is good. it is a good four miles to the convention center. There is a nice little pizza brewery right in the parking lot, and that made things really easy. Oggis. Stick with the pizza! Lots of choices and pretty good.

Ours was a one bedroom suite and along with the kitchen appliances and kitchen equipment, there was a flat screen TV in the sitting area and also in the bedroom, a very comfortable king-size bed and bathroom with shower and bath. The room also had doors that lead to a small balcony and my one suggestion would be that chairs are supplied to enable you to sit out, as although we had a smoking room for my partner, he still preferred to smoke here rather than in the room itself. Breakfast was excellent, although my advice would be to get there before 9.00am as that\u2019s when the main crowd arrive and (especially at weekends) there can be queues, particularly at the waffle making machines. Other options included scrambled egg, home fries, bacon and/or sausage patties, toast, bagels, muffins, cereals, juice, yoghurt, fruit etc. Just about anything you could want really. The Homewood also serves early evening meals Monday \u2013 Thursday and we enjoyed a few of these including hot dogs and macaroni bolognaise, during these meals they also provide salad plus wine and beer, a good option for families with ever hungry children! The property is divided into north and south buildings with an area between that had barbeques to use plus seating areas around gas fires. Each building has a fitness room, more geared up for people doing CV work rather than a weights routine, and there is also a basketball court. The pool area is very nice, although at the beginning of our stay the water was very cold, this appeared to have been rectified later in the week, and the sun beds the most comfortable I have ever used with a lovely thick mattress. Pool towels are also available and can be picked up by the pool.

Other places include a Sushi restaurant that looked very popular, a Mexican Caf\u00e9 plus Subway and Starbucks.

The large refrigerator was great for keeping our leftovers, milk, etc cool for us. It was quiet, we rarely heard anyone else in the hotel. We were on the fourth floor in a corner that faced water each direction. It didn't have the small balcony, but we didn't mind. Breakfast was something our kids looked forward to each day.

Our initial experience wasn't what we expected, as when we arrived we were told that the only room available was a first floor suite, which we discovered after entering was designed for handicapped guests, and as such featured a large bathroom with no discernible break between shower and the rest of the room. Meaning that taking a shower would result in water going all over the bathroom. The kitchen was small and cramped as well. This wasn't acceptable for a family with young kids, so we went back to the desk and were told we could switch rooms the next day, which we did, moving to a much larger room on the 2nd floor. After that, the stay was perfect. As others have noted the hotel features tons of amenities to keep kids and parents entertained. Highlights for us included daily breakfast buffet (though the eggs are always overcooked) featuring a variety of fruits, cereals, as well as waffles and breads/pastries. They also rotate a daily \"meat\" dish (either bacon, sausage, or biscuits/gravy). Other highlights included the sports court which we used most mornings for a bit of basketball, a pool table, free wired/wireless Internet, free Business center, complementary popcorn/coffee/tea in the rooms, large fridges, fully stocked kitchens, pool, jacuzzi, outdoor hot tub, outdoor terraces, and the surroundings which includes the USS Recruit, a training ship built into the ground, and the bay behind the hotel featuring walking/jogging paths. Across the parking lot is a small shopping center featuring about half a dozen places to eat (Sushiya and Oggis were very good). Service was fine, we didn't have any problems, and the staff was very friendly. Rooms were clean and spacious. There is are outdoor gas grills but we never got to use them. Rooms are equipped with two flat-screen HD TVs with ample selection of HD programming and movies on demand. The only complaint about the room is that the pull-out couch is uncomfortable, but the main bed/pillows are wonderful (and they give you plenty of pillows). They also advertise a complementary light dinner Mon-Thur, though we never tried it. The location is of course ideal, five-ten minutes from major tourist hotspots including the USS Midway, Gas Lamp, Old Town, and Seaport Village as well as Seaworld and Mission Beach and five minutes from the I-5 to head north to Legoland, La Jolla and other locations. Parking was always plentiful and close by. Keep in mind this is a family oriented hotel, there are kids everywhere, breakfast is a bit crazy, and the hotel is pretty much quiet by 9:00 PM. There's no bar, but they do sell beer/wine at the pantry. A Vons grocery store is about 5 minutes away off Rosencrants street.

Our suite (466) was on the fourth floor looking over the central facility; if you looked sideways you could see the esplanade and canal. The room was very comfortable throughout our stay, and our son was delighted to go from a college bunk bed to a queen bed, private bath, large desk, and balcony. And free wireless, of course. Our room was on the corner which was great for lack of noisy connecting walls; the only problem was the closet in the king bed room was not really set up to hang things but fitted with a couple of wire shelves so we had to share our son\u2019s closet. One bathroom was actually a handicapped room so we had plenty of space. The kitchen was well equipped although we barely used it. The beds were great. The hotel was in an excellent location for us to get everywhere we wanted to go; everything seemed close by and it was only minutes to downtown. And it was very pleasant to be right on the waterway with a beautiful path past birds of paradise and palm trees. The planes did not bother us at all; the \u201cwhite noise\u201d of the room fan was enough to block them out. The breakfast was handy to have but it didn\u2019t really seem like a lot of variety although the fruit and waffles were nice; we did eat breakfast out one day. It never got too crowded to find a table but it was close a couple of times. The two suppers during our stay were Swedish meatballs and meatloaf; although we ate dinner out we did stop by for salad, rolls, and a nice glass of wine. We didn\u2019t spend a lot of time in the hotel and it was a little too cool to swim, but it was very pleasant to come back to our little apartment every night and be able to spread out and relax (and nice to have a place to put the doggie bags from dinner). We only got a short look at Liberty Station when we went to the Von\u2019s for sandwiches one day, and to get ice cream at Stone Cold another time, but it all looked like a very nice place to stroll.

After reviewing the reviews here on TripAdviser (specifically looking for a best rated hotel for a family with young kids), I decided to reserve a 1BR bay view for 199.99/night with one king size bed (in an enclosed BR) and a sofa bed in the living/kitchen area. I have to say, my stay didn\u2019t really live up to my expectations. Don\u2019t get me wrong. The hotel isn\u2019t bad. It\u2019s very clean and modern, and I had no problems with the staff, but I found the hotel room and my experience somewhat lacking. When we first arrived at around 10pm on a Saturday, the first thing I noticed was a group of young people smoking and talking loudly on the balcony in one of the rooms on the second floor of the North building where we stayed. Apparently there was a party going on in that room which was pretty loud. Some of the guys from the party were also down at the entrance of the building to have a smoke. Being this was in a navy town (and the name of the hotel - liberty station), I expect they were military (one even said \u201cgood evening sir\u201d as I passed thru the entrance with my luggage). Don't get me wrong, I'm a formal military person, and completely understand, but it was still disconcerting entering with my family with these young guys laughing and smoking at the entrance. That night we could even hear the party going on from our room which was on the fourth floor and on the other side of the building. Fortunately, that night, we were too tired to care, and it appeared their stay was for only that night since we didn\u2019t see or hear them the rest of the stay. Regarding the room, although very clean, was much smaller than I expected (at least from what I expected looking at the pictures). The King size bed took up a lot of the bedroom, so there wasn\u2019t much clearance to get to the drawers in front, but the bed was comfortable with lots of pillows. The sofa bed when rolled out was clean and good too. They provided sheets, a blanket, and a couple of pillows in the closet, but when rolled out, the bed took up quite a bit of the living area too. One problem was that there was only one small vanity with a single bathroom sink to share among the entire family \u2013 not the two sink with a wide top and mirror that you see in most hotels. The sink was also outside the toilet/shower room which had its pluses and minuses. The plus is that if you shower, you can close the bathroom door so the mirror doesn\u2019t fog up. The minus is that the sink/vanity is in the bedroom area which means less privacy. One other annoyance about the bathroom was that the shower head was way up high. I\u2019m 5\u201911 and I had to reach almost at full arm\u2019s length to adjust the nozzle setting, so I would think this would be a disadvantage for a shorter person like my wife. Also, it\u2019s a fixed nozzle, so you can\u2019t direct the direction of the shower spray, but it did provide plenty of hot water. The closet was relatively small too, so I think the room I selected was meant more for a single person or a couple, but not a family. The view wasn\u2019t that great either. It was more a view overlooking the pool, and the view of the bay was a partial unimpressive one. Knowing this, I\u2019m thinking it would have been better to select a cheaper room without a view. Visiting nearby Coronado, maybe next time, I would consider a hotel overlooking the ocean Some other minor things that I think the hotel could have done to make the hotel more attractive to a family with kids: spend a little money and include some packs of hot chocolate for the kids instead of just coffee and tea, and at least include the Disney Channel on the cable TV. All there was for kids it seemed was the Cartoon network which didn\u2019t have a great selection of cartoons at that (seemed a lot were adult oriented at night). The hotel provides free continental breakfast buffet every morning, but again, it didn\u2019t look as nice as the pictures on the website. The breakfast is held in the hotel eating area (not a restaurant) near the hotel lobby. On our first morning (Sunday), it was packed and loud. We had to wait a bit for a table to open. The breakfast was standard budget items you would buy in bulk at Cosco (powdered eggs, cereal, bacon, fruits, small Danishes, toast, juices, coffee etc. You could make your own large waffles. The breakfast was o.k. It was all you can eat, so we made sure we got our fill and took some fruit and things up to the hotel room for later. The next morning (Monday) was less crowded though and we had no problem getting a table, so I guess it\u2019s the weekends when it gets crowded. There didn\u2019t seem to be many \u201cfamily with kids\u201d oriented restaurants within walking distance of the hotel either. There was a Mexican and a Thai restaurant, but they seemed more geared for business people and didn\u2019t seem to have many customers. A Subway, a Greek Caf\u00e9, and a Pizza/sport\u2019s bar restaurant was also nearby but we didn\u2019t consider them great places to take a family to dinner. I would like to have seen a reasonably priced chain family restaurant like MiMi\u2019s or AppleBee\u2019s close by, but it seems you had to travel a number of miles to get to these type restaurants. The pool was clean and warm and there was a nice Jacuzzi hot tub, and interestingly enough there didn\u2019t seem to be anyone using them during our stay, so we had these facilities all to ourselves. The location of the hotel is located just off the airport and close by to attractions like sea world, San Diego Zoo, and old town, but it was also relatively far away from attractions that I think are more interesting and fun like the Wild Animal Park, Lego land, and Coronado beach. Available parking was plentiful and free which was great compared to other hotels. Again, I wouldn\u2019t say that our stay was all bad \u2013 just didn\u2019t live up to my expectations based on the reviews, the hotel website, and for what I paid. It seems most of the great reviews for this Hotel was for those who chose the two bedroom suite, so maybe that would have made a difference. In my opinion, the hotel wasn\u2019t the greatest for a family with young kids. I would say the hotel is better for people here on business, a single person, or a couple (but NOT on their honeymoon) on an extended stay at San Diego. The hotel just didn\u2019t seem to have that \u201cFamily Fun\u201d factor about it if you know what I mean.", "Date": "November 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sublette, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cEasy to see why this topped the Trip Advisor list\u201d", "Author": "jasruth", "ReviewID": "UR21443248", "Content": "We really enjoyed our stay here.

My sons had a bedroom with a queen bed, a TV and a bathroom, my husband and I had a king with our own bathroom and TV and my daughter had the pull out couch with her own Tv. Hav ing the kitchen was invaluable. We picked up groceries at Trader Joe's (3-5 min car trip) and kept them in the fridge. We also took a cooler and filled it with sandwich fixings, sodas and fruit the days we went to Sea World, the Wild Animal Park and the Zoo. We didn't take the cooler into the parks, but kept it in the car for a picnic lunch. Huge money saver! As other posters have said, the hotel is a superb value. Free breakfast, free light dinner, including beer and wine (M-Th eves). The hotel is new and in a fantastic location. It's right off Harbor Drive in the former naval station that's been torn down and rebuilt as Liberty Station. There are parks being built, condos, restaurants, shops and the two hotels; Homewood Suites and Marriott Courtyard (next door). There's a beautiful walking path along the water behind the hotel. The navy training vessel, the Recruit, is in dry dock, right next to the hotel. Signs indicated it will be a museum. Within the same parking lot there are numerous restaurants, including a Starbucks. Turning out of the hotel onto Harbor Drive puts you at the marina area for harbor cruises, the Midway, the Star of India, etc.. within 5 minutes. Again, super location. The staff was very friendly and our room was always cleaned quickly. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good value in a great location.

The grounds are lovely with a walkway along the inlet right on the property. There are two outdoor gas fireplaces that were so nice to sit around on cool nights. If you desire to grill your own meal, there are two gas grills. There is a variety of restaurants within walking distance and the hotel is only 1.5 blocks from public transportatiion.

The cost of our room, especially considering the meals provided, was a bargain. We had expected breakfast, but what we received was BREAKFAST, including scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage, hash browns, juice, hot and cold cereal, waffles, yogurt. fresh melon and fruit, plus coffee and hot chocolate. One morning we had sausage gravy and biscuits, (my favorite). We were also lucky to have our visit coincide with the nights Homewood Suites provide an evening meal (Monday thru Thursday).

My son and I tagged along while my husband was away on business. We loved the location and all of the amenities the hotel had to offer. Our teenage son played basketball there, used the pool table and swimming pool. The landscaping and outdoor areas are beautiful. We stayed in a studio suite. Friends of ours had a one bedroom suite. With the exception of the additional television I actually preferred the studio suite. I liked the open floor plan better. The location is great. Read the other reviews on that. Oggi's right next door has great pizza. Two grocery stores are very close to the hotel. The staff was very helpful. They printed a boarding pass for me when I was having difficulty, provided us with directions and took care of anything we asked of them. We ate the light dinner one evening and appreciated it. We also had breakfast there each morning. I would say if you are staying there more than a few days you may tire of the same breakfast every day. They do have a variety but really only seem to switch from bacon to sausage. I have been at other Hilton properties, Hampton Inn, in particular that have had better breakfasts. I didn't care for the potatoes or eggs they served. Having said that they do offer oatmeal and waffles and other items so we never really went hungry. Housekeeping was great. They do not have in-room safes. We used the hotel shuttle from the airport. We were told it would be a 15 minute wait. After an hour I called the hotel back and a van arrived. The van has a large green Marriott emblem on the hood and side of the van. On the side behind the Marriott logo is the Homewood Suites logo in a light color. The courtesy area is very busy at the airport and I was only able to see the Marriott logo when the van initially went around and ignored it. An hour later when the driver showed up there were no vehicles around it and I caught a glimpse of the Homewood Suites logo. I wished they would have told me when I phoned for the shuttle to look for a van with both logos on it. I wonder how often they have to return because people miss that. My husband was traveling with co-workers. We chose this property because the \"W\" hotel was sold out. They finished their work a few days earlier. The guys that stayed at the \"W\" were forced to pay for the next day because they did not give 24 hours notice. My husband checked with the staff around dinner time the night before and they had no problem with him checking out the next morning. We have family in this area and most definately will stay here again. This property is at the very top of my list.", "Date": "August 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, NV", "Title": "\u201cTerrific property & location though pricey\u201d", "Author": "Marsh511", "ReviewID": "UR18621643", "Content": "Just stayed 4 nights with a family of 4 (w/ wife, 7, 5 yr old girls) on our annual San Diego visit. We need SPACE when we travel as a family, so we always look for a 2-bedroom suite. WIth this stay, Homewood has now taken over our #1 spot from the Staybridge chain. This property is located in a deceptively convenient location, about 8-10 minutes from the airport, 10+ minutes to Sea World or Old Town, and just over 15 minutes from places like Seaport Village, Petco Park, and Gaslamp District (though I'd imagine during rush hour, this could double). We were also able to WALK across the parking lot to no less than SIX good places to eat for families (nothing fancy...but a great Greek restaurant and an pub/pizza/Italian place Oggi's were typical). There's also a Starbucks and Subway there. Not only that, Homewood properties serve a darn good evening snack which almost works as a meal (meatloaf, lasagne, tacos, etc.), at least for the kids. The 2-bedroom suites are similar to other chains' 2-BDs - but the middle living room and kitchen area seemed more spacious than Residence Inn, Summerfield Suites, or Staybridge...and the property was absolutely spotless! This hotel has a better-than-adequate pool as well as eating area...though because of the summer vacation high occupancy, finding seating during breakfast was a little tough. Still, there are many outdoor tables just outside the dining area that served as a great overflow for many families. In the evenings, a few parties were using the outdoor grill to cook up their own burgers, etc. All in all, this property seemed to be planned very meticulously. On the downside: (a) meal service workers were like timekeeping Nazi's - by 9:30 a.m SHARP, pretty much every food item was put away, and when I wandered over to see what was still out and to try to get one more cup of orange juice, one worker sternly eyed me and barked out \"We stop serving at 9:30.\" During the summer, it would be great if this hotel kept weekend hours (to 10 a.m.) for breakfasts every day. The breakfast food selection at this Homewood didn't have quite the same variety or quality as a Homewood I stayed in Texas last month...but still much better than adequate. (b) Elevators are *extremely* slow...and few. A property of this size could use 2 sets of elevators per building...and they can certainly move a little faster. During room clean-up time (which may be pretty much all day), the housekeeping crew did not appear to have their own elevators, so they frequently tied up the single elevator (per building) with their carts and maintenance items. Try to get a room that faces either the parking lot (still a nice view of hills and the recently completed Liberty Landing/Navy Training Center commercial complex) or the Bay. I would opt for the non-premium (not \"Bay View\") rooms on a high floor (3 or 4) as this would keep your costs a bit lower. Try to avoid the rooms that face the between-building walkways, especially on the 1st 2 levels as there's a lot of pedestrian traffic, mostly hotel guests coming and going...but they seem very close when your room faces the walkway. At $284/night, this was one of the most expensive 2-bedroom suites we've stayed at, but considering the time of year and location, I still feel we got a good deal. And kudos to the housekeeping crew who did a terrific job cleaning our room every day, and managed to do so without misplacing or losing any of our kids' stuff (you know how 5 & 7 years olds drop or leave crayons, books, and stuffed animals *anywhere*) -- instead, they neatly arranged items they found on top of the dresser. AND, they did all of this with a very limited window of time as we tended to come back to our room several times daily, and we'd put up the \"Privacy\" sign often. Still, they found the time to do an excellent job cleaning and prepping our room every day. Oh...our suite also had 3 fantastic 37 or 40\" (didn't measure LOL) LCD TV's that kept everyone happy in the evenings. If you have a PS3 or WII or another video console, BRING IT!! On second thought, your kids may never want to leave the room... I give this property my highest recommendation.", "Date": "August 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson, AZ", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful room, great location, but expensive.\u201d", "Author": "Likes3StarsorBetter", "ReviewID": "UR18134205", "Content": "This was by far the most well appointed room that we stayed in during our recent trip to California.

Very close to San Diego harbor, downtown, Harbor and Shelter Islands, and the airport (but we did not hear any airplane noise). There are dining options close by. A good pizza restaurant and bar is within walking distance. I think there is also a Subway restaurant and a wine tasting bar in the same shopping area. The down side of this hotel is the price. Our suite with tax was about $350.00, but it was on a weekend in July which is the high season in San Diego, and the location is close to just about all of the sights to see there.

Full breakfast and nice dinner all included in the bill. Pool table room, nice swimming pool area. This place was getting a high volume of people running through it and there staff was perfect at cleaning up and making you feel like you were staying at home (actually that is not a true statement because at home we would not keep our place this spotless all the time). We also loved the location = they have a nice walking/jogging path along a lake or ocean inlet. Right next door is a plaza full of brand new stores offering all kinds of food options. There is even a massage place that was brand new and offering a one time introductory massage for $ 39 (hour)/$ 57 (1.5 hours) that both my wife and I took advantage of.

Our suite was spacious, even with a crib in the room. My husband loved the flat screen tv's. There are lots of restaurants close by, and Subway and Oggi's are both walking distance. There is a big navy ship cemented into the ground next to the hotel which was an amazing sight for the kids. Alsothere is a big grassy area to run around and play and a basketball court. There are full kitchens and dining room tables. We borrowed a high chair from the hotel's main dining room which made meal times easy for our 1 year old. We stayed for a weekend so we didn't get the evening meal but there were great choices for breakfast including lots of hot and cold items, juice, etc. My daughter enjoyed making her own waffle in the do-it-yourself waffle iron. The only thing I would say about breakfast is that the breakfast \"hostesses\" were not very friendly. They were not outwardly rude but they did not speak or smile the whole time we were there. They just stood next to the food with stony faces and replenished items when necesary. My husband joked that they should be called the \"breakfast wardens\" instead. We stayed here for an event at the san diego sports arena which was just a 10 minute drive away and downtown san diego was just a short drive away also. Overall I would say that this is a great hotel for families with young children and the breakfast is a great perk that will save you lots of travel time and money and will not dissapoint. *One important tip, request a room away from the elevator or you will end up asking to switch rooms.
