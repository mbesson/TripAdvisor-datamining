Although nighttime temps were cool enough, if you left your windows open you got mosquitoes coming in the room as well as LOTS of street noise - from trash being poured into bins and then being picked up in the early morning to noisy, drunken tourists in nearby restaurants to early morning noise from nearby places opening and cooking, etc.They also have some VERY remote rooms where the person across the hall from you is in their own apartment - NOT the hotel. Our friends went up the elevator to a floor and then had to walk down 2 flights of concrete stairs to get to their room and they were the ONLY hotel room on the floor.....VERY weird.Breakfast was fair.", "Date": "Oct 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR300733625", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "jillhou"}, {"Content": "Rate it 3 1/2 stars My husband  I stayed here for 3 nights in early June 2008. We were on a 4 city bus tour of Italy so the tour company selected the hotel. I'd rate it 3 1/2 stars. Our room was very clean. It did not face the street so it was quiet at night. It was a good location to be able to walk to various sites such as the Ponte Vecchio, the Boboli Gardens, the Academy Gallery with the statue of David, the San Lorenzo market, the cathedral, etc. We enjoyed being able to walk to the sites. A sightseeing tip - if you have a car or transportation, I'd recommend visiting the town of San Gimignano which is about an hour away. For breakfast, the hotel provided a good variety of foods. As far as the air conditioning. The temperature seemed to be preset much higher than the other hotels we had stayed at. Our tour guide told us we could adjust the thermostat which we did. We lowered the setting but the thermostat's display giving the actual temperature never went any lower. So our room was a bit warm but never hot. There is internet service available for a reasonable fee. The computer is located in the basement. It was not easy to get the connection so we found ourselves making at least 2 trips to the lobby to get help.", "Date": "Jul 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR940708673", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Virginia2002"}, {"Content": "A 3-star hotel There is nothing wrong with this hotel. It is decently clean, and the location is quite good. The staff is nice and helpful. But it is decidedly not at a 4-star level, despite what its accepted rating seems to be. (All Italian hotels post their star rating rather permanently, outside. I guess everyone knows that, but point is that it's not the self-rating that US hotels use, it should be more trustable.).Actually, I have stayed in 4-star hotels in the south of Italy that were similar, but down there your expectations are lower. Up north like this, my 3-star experience (say, the Doria in Lerici) is quite a bit nicer than the Palazzo.The common breakfast area  bar is spartan and a little depressing, the breakfast itself is packaged cheese slices and small bready things, and the room is, well, just a room.I paid $200 a night on Hotwire. I was expecting a pretty nice 4-star experience for an OK price.

Your experience here will depend on your wants for location, near the station, not so near to centro storico, but still in walking distance. This is arguably the cleanest hotel of its class and with the most friendly and supportive staff. All of the staff, desk personnel, breakfast staff and cleaning people went out of their way to be friendly and accomodating. Note about prior reviewer - if you book a single, of course you are going to get just that - a single. As far as the AC goes, Florence is just like many other American cities in that they turn the AC on a proscibed date in order to conserve energy. The Ognissanti does indeed have AC, just not in the period in which you traveled. I would highly recommend this hotel to the traveler who wants to be near the station without the seedy surroundings that some station hotels offer.", "Date": "Apr 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR469547400", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "fabiolina"}, {"Content": "Pros  I would like to start this review off by strongly recommending NOT using Cheaptickets. They are incompetent, don't know their own policies, and almost resulted in me missing my trip, and thousands of dollars. I Stayed at the Palazzo Ognissanti for 5 nights and when I got there, since I had booked as one person, I had a tiny room with a single bed, which I didn't know existed because all of the hotels in America that I've b een to have queen or king. Anyways, my girlfriend was supposed to stay with me so this wouldnt work. I had to pay 30 euro a night to upgrade to a room with 2 double beds that would not stay together because they werent put in place or anything. Next, the room was stifling hot so that prevented me from sleeping as well. When I asked how to turn up the A/C, the staff replied There is no A/C because it was the winter season and they didn't have it turned on (even though it was 50/60 degrees outside). We witnessed two other parties complaining about this so we know it wasn't only us. There are some pros about the hotel, it is very new and modern, the housekeepers kept the rooms extremely tidy, the staff was friendly and professional, and there is a complimentary, but subpar breakfast offered. Good for the money, but I would look for something closer to the Duomo, and maybe a larger hotel that has A/C and full-sized beds.

The train station is no more than a five minute walk away.While there are certainly many hotels located much closer to the heart of the city, what you get for the location is worth it: a modern hotel with an extremely helpful and friendly staff all at a reduced price simply because of the location. Their breakfast was amusingly strange: they had Philadelphia Cream Cheese but no bagels. There is a small supermarket about a minute from the hotel where you can buy the same bottled water restaurants and vendors charge 2 euros for for only .25 cents. The Mercato Centrale, an open air market, is ten minutes away where you can get excellent fresh fruit at a cheap price.

Generally I felt that this hotel had no atmosphere and really shouldn't be listed as a 4 star hotel. The staff in the hotel weren't as friendly as other staff we had encountered in hotels during our stay in Italy although they could be described as very efficient. The entrance to the hotel was very clinical and not as welcoming as anywhere else we have stayed. Gone were the lovely comforatable sofas and they were replaced with quite hard chairs. The rooms were quite coldly decorated althought they were exceptionally clean as was the rest of the hotel. The rooms had verything that you would have expected of a 3 star hotel in fact some 3 star hotels we have stayed in in Italy have been much more comfortable. The room did have a really cool TV though. We were given a room with little balcony which was nice except the street down below was very noisy and there was a great deal of fumes from the traffic.The breakfast was below the standard I have come to expect from Italian hotels. This hotel had possibly the worst coffee I have ever tasted even compared to establishments at home. It was weak and watery. The waiters started to clear all the tables of tablecloths about 30 mins before breakfast was even due to finish which made us feel that we were in the way.The hotel has a 'bar area' but I never saw anyone sitting in it and this is maybe why the place lacked atmosphere and a lived in feeling. It was a little further out of the centre of Florence that we would have liked,- it was about a 20 mins walk down the river to the Ponte Vecchio.Generally this place was OK for the money as it was clean but don't expect that warm italian welcome or the famous italian coffee and be prepared to pay for breakfast afterwards.", "Date": "Aug 16, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR804612312", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Herbiegoesbananas"}, {"Content": "Nice but noisy I stayed at the Palazzo Ognissanti for three nights last week, based on a great rate I confirmed for two single rooms at octopustravel.The hotel is new and was very clean.
