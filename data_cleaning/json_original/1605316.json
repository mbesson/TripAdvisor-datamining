Situated on a bustling square with a small flower Market in front of it. Rooms are small but spotlessly clean, comfortable beds, good shower rooms, communal guest kitchen. No frills but an excellent situation re access to transport, museums, theatre restaurants, bars shopping etc. and good Wifi connection It does have a downside as the rooms on the front of the hosal can be very noisy indeed this can continue until late into the night. One footnote about Madrid do take care with handbags wallets etc. pickpockets are prevelant and work in groups.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, Italy", "Title": "\u201cNice accommodation, central location: we'll come back!\u201d", "Author": "goodtraveller85", "ReviewID": "UR117764854", "Content": "We stayed there reserving two double rooms: one for me and my husband, the second one for my parents-in-law. We spent 2 nights in Madrid and enjoyed our stay at Hostal Tirso Plaza: rooms are new, clean and comfortable, location is perfect as it is just in front of the tube and just a few minutes away by foot from all central attractions in Madrid. The owners - a gentleman and a lady - are very kind and patient. In May my parents went to Madrid and they stayed here, as I recommend this hostal: they enjoyed their stay here. Don't worry about the main entrance: it does not seem an hostal, it seems to be in a building on a \"renovation status\" but inside, on the upper floor, apartments exist and are fine! :-)", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hostal Tirso Plaza", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d1605316-Reviews-Hostal_Tirso_Plaza-Madrid.html", "Price": "$52 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Plaza Tirso de Molina, 13, 2, D</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28012</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1605316", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/bf/03/2c/hostal-tirso-plaza-thumbnail.jpg"}}
