What sets it apart from others are its consistently friendly and efficient staff and smart and functional room furnishings.Also to be commended is that, though there is no in-house fitness center, hotel guests get free access to the nearby California Fitness Center. Other nice touches are the flat-screen TV's, DVD players, and relatively spacious bathrooms (note that the rooms themselves are not large). The only major disappointment was the uncomfortably hard beds.Other considerations: internet access is about US$10 per day; breakfast is unexceptional (there are numerous restaurants in the area); and the room service menu is very limited (but the food quality is good).All in all, this is a solid choice for the money.", "Date": "Nov 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR800442686", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Travel Richly"}, {"Content": "Good Hotel We stayed in the Fleming hotel as a stop over in Hong Kong. The area of the hotel central to the main area with some good food options. The travel to the hotel was easy from the airport, i was concerned as some friends had told us it wasnt worth traveling to the island for a one night stay. I disagree it was easy. We caught the Parklane Airport shuttle bus (collect Terminal 1, B16 or A16), this was very convenient and easy. The cost was $21 AUD Per person and was door to door. The staff from the hotel greeted us near the bus stop and where eager to carry all our luggage to the hotel. We arrived late and wanted to be checked in quickly to go out for dinner and sight seeing. The staff where efficient and checked us in and carried all our luggage to our room, we where out within 10mins.The room was nice and comfortable. The bathroom was great and the shower was fantastic. The only thing i would say is that the bed was very hard, however im a pillow top lover!The cost of the hotel was average, we got the hotel for 245 AUD on a one night stay.", "Date": "Oct 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR863032942", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Kattt006"}, {"Content": "A Gem Hidden in the Heart of Wanchai I'm a regular traveller to Hong Kong and over the past decade I've sampled many, many hotels both on HK Island and in Kowloon.On my last stay, I tried The Fleming, primarily because I liked the location which is adjacent to the Wanchai bars/pubs/restaruant area. It's a great place enjoy evenings when work is done.The hotel's style, the room, and the staff were all well above my expectations for this price point ($165 USD). The room itself was clean and bright and included a flat-screen TV (limited channels though), CD player, in-room safe, 2 double beds, and excellent (cold!) aircon. I'll also make special note of the shower which had a great set-up and had amazing power and heat. The only drawback to the hotel would be the restaurant which is small with a limited menu. It's certainly adequate enough.I would highly recommend staying at the Fleming and will stay there again myself.PS - This hotel is not located in a typical glitzy tourist area and as such, the location/surroundings might not appeal to everyone.

However, the rooms -- albeit a bit small -- are very sensibly laid out. There is no traffic noise even though an elevated part of Fleming Road is very close. However, there is one big noise problem: for some reason the hotel has two elevators side by side -- one for odd numbers, the other for even. Our first room had unbearable noise from an elevator. We complained. The staff -- very congenial and obliging -- changed our room to one farther from the elevator -- even though the hotel seemed to be full. (We were there for four nights.) The new room was quite quiet. The breakfast room requires going outside and going into the breakfast room through another door -- tricky in a heavy rain.

The location is great for those who prefer to experience 'local' Hong Kong markets and eateries and the limited number of rooms gives the hotel an intimate, almost cosy feel.However the basics have to be right. On arrival our deluxe room was not ready until 4pm (we arrived at HK at 6.30am). The room we were allocated was on a smoking floor despite us having requested a non-smoking room in advance. When we asked to move rooms we were told (rather indifferently) that no deluxe rooms were available and that our only option was to upgrade to an executive room, at our cost. This left a slightly bitter taste in our mouths for the first night!Despite this disappointment, we could not fault the quality of the rooms or the service thereafter, especially for the price we were paying (even if it was slightly higher than we had planned due to the enforced upgrade).

I stayed here twice in June 07. It is located within a few hundred metres of the convention centre, wanchai pier and on the corner of Jaffe Road and Fleming Rd Overpass. Quiet, clean, newly renovated, staff are friendly and efficient.Rooms are nice and big by Hong Kong standards. I had a deluxe room and it was big enough for me with a King bed. I was on the Island for business and the hotel is only a few hundred metres to the MTR train system and Kowloon is only a few minutes away by train. Yes, the rooms had views over surrounding properties but this is HongKong and you will pay for the privelege of harbour views. What are you doing in the room anyway? This is Hong Kong!Yes, this hotel is in WanChai and the seamier colourful side of Hong Kong is down the road . But things are going up market here too and I felt safe at night with heaps of things going on around you all the time. Nice restaurants and famous bars and pubs abound nearby. Try Coyote Bar and Grill for great mexician or Carnegies for authentic pub fare.I have been to Hong Kong heaps and this is a great hotel for both the business and conventioneer or adventurous tourist who wants to escape the touristy side of Kowloon. TImes Square Shopping, Pacific Place Shopping are all 5 minutes away in a cab or via the MTR. ( Buy an Octopus Card)The Fleming is Highly recommended to all.

We love this hotel! By the time we arrived, a major renovation has just completed that turned it into a modern and tasteful hotel best designed for business professionals and tourists who want high standard accommodation with everything plus a cozy at-home feel.Everything is so new, modern and well designed. I feel like living in a luxury condo. You can find everything you may need in your room. They even provide stationary and a yoga mat! How cool is that!The location cannot be better. It is 30-40 minutes from the airport by taxi. If you are on a budget you may take a bus for HK$40 (30 minutes, plus 3-5 minutes walk to the hotel), getting off near Wai Chai Police Station.To the north, 15 minutes walk to the new Convention  Exhibition Centre (3 minutes walk to the old one). Starbucks is only 3 minutes away. To the south-west, 5 minutes walk to Wan Chai MTR station and China Travel Service (for China visas and buses to a few south China cities). To the East, Causeway Bay (major high-end shopping districts on the Island) is just one MTR station away, which is also within walking distance. From the hotel to Causeway Bay, including a few streets down the south, you will find dozens (if not hundreds) of restaurants, caf\u8305s, fast food eateries, convenience shops, fruit/juice stands, pharmacies, fashion shops, CD/computer merchandises and newspaper stands, most from low to medium price range. The Wai Chai market, which is only 7 minutes walk to the south, sells ginseng, bird\u9225\u6a9a nest, dried abalone and Chinese herbal medicine just like the one in Sheung Wan, with only fewer shops.Central and Admiralty ( central business/financial areas in Hong Kong) are two/one MTR stations to the west respectively, and Sheung Wan is just one more MTR station further.The staffs in the hotel are very friendly, considerate and eagle to help. They not just provide 5-star service, but make me feel that they are the management team of my 5-star luxury condo.We will certainly stay in this hotel every time we visit Hong Kong, unless all rooms are taken.", "Date": "May 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR402589540", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "9mastok"}, {"Content": "Very Chic Urban Hotel I spent a week at The Fleming in Nov. 07, and I am full of praise. The decor is fantastic - very modern, chic and minimalistic. Consult their website - everything you see there is for real. The Deluxe Double Room I stayed in was large by any standards, but huge for Hong Kong with big windows, ample storage space, a plasma TV, internet access and even a little kitchenette. The bathroom was on the tiny side (no tub), fittings, however, are very modern, and I found it fully sufficient and always sparkling clean. It is true, the stylish breakfast area is small, yet as mentioned below it was never crowded when I ate there. The hotel does not have a pool, which did not bother me (in November the weather was too cold for swimming anyhow), and guests can use a gym that is located just round the corner. Service whenever I needed it was good. The staff did their best to be accommodating. The location of the hotel is fabulous - smack in the middle of Wanchai with lots of restaurants, shops etc. and - contrary to tourist-trap Tsim Sha Tsui - a real Chinese feel about it. Public transport (MTR, buses, trams) is in short walking distance. It was pure bliss coming back to the hotel, a haven in manic Hong Kong, after a hard day of shopping. In a nutshell: The Fleming is a superb 4* urban hotel suitable for tourists and business travellers alike.
