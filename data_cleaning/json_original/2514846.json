As much as I rely and love using tripadvisor, I have a feeling that hotels (those with high ratings) can rest on their laurels because of this and perhaps some lower rated hotels doesn't get a fair chance- That is why I have decided to give Hotel Keppler 3 stars- and these are my reasons: We booked this hotel as a valentines trip. I emailed the hotel a month before arriving to confirm our room and also to ask for restaurant recommendations since a) their concierge came highly recommended on here and b)it's valentines- everything will be booked. I patiently waited a week and after receiving no response i emailed them again. Again, i received absolutely no response. My husband called the hotel 2 days before leaving London to confirm they have our reservation and enquire why they haven't responded to any emails- they had \"a problem with their system for the last 2 days\".. hummm We found the hotel quite easily, it's a short walk from George V station, the lobby is small but elegant. Check in was straight forward and professional but not warm and engaging in the slightest. Perhaps the Parisian way but not what I gathered from previous reviewers? We had a bell boy take our luggage to our room. As soon as we entered our room I realised they gave us the wrong room category. This room was tiny- don't bother trying to swing a cat. Reluctantly we had to waste time and go downstairs to sort this out. My husband asked them what room they gave us- instead of telling us the category (classic- avoid unless you're travelling solo) the receptionist replied \"let me check what category you booked) He came back with a \"oh, we gave you the wrong room). Perhaps i'm cynical but it seems to me that they knew they gave us the wrong room. Back up to the 3rd floor, on to the new room which was slightly bigger. Toiletries were good quality and bath robes and slippers provided but only two bath towels- nothing to dry hair. Two small hand towels but I had to use these as bath mats since the shower (in the bath) spilled water all over the floor after each shower and no bath mats provided. We had no problems with noise despite being on the road side. The pillows were TERRIBLE. Small, square european and lumpy. yuk. Because of our room incident I thought they might send us a glass of wine to aplogise or perhaps a note? I'm not normally fussed with things like this but since they are a boutique hotel- this attention to detail counts and especially since I read one reviewer reporting he didn't like a restaurant recommendation they gave him and in return they apologised by sending a big bottle of Hermes to his room? hmmm. Does make one question some of the reviews. And since it was valentines and Paris- perhaps heart shaped chocolates at turn down? Cocktails at the bar with a valentines twist? Something? Boutique hotel? Anyways, we made our own reservations (i highly recommend restaurant Jamin- 10 minute walk and great food) and the rest of the trip was fine. I was critical with my review but I think all too often (myself included) hotels get bookings based on TA reviews. I think it's only fair then that the negative gets pointed out also for people to be able to make a informed decision. This was an ok hotel. Not bad but not great. Will I stay here again? Probably not. One final point and to end the review on a positive- the breakfast ladies are a real asset to hotel Keppler and run the pretty breakfast room with military precision- well done.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSmall, stylish, boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "pbda", "ReviewID": "UR124569074", "Content": "This superbly located hotel is discreet, with excellent links to transportation.

This truly exceptional service turned around our whole day. The location of the hotel is excellent. However, you should have the exact hotel address handy if you are taking a cab because not all cab drivers are familiar with the hotel location and it is located on a side street. The common rooms of the hotel are beautifully furnished and decorated. You feel like you are walking into a Parisian couture showroom when you walk into the lobby. Since our stay was so short, we did not have a chance to have breakfast at the hotel or use the fitness center, though the facilities looked very nice. The high end fashion theme is carried through to the design of the hotel rooms. Our room was exceptionally spacious and had a lovely view out across the nearby rooftops -- which felt very Parisian. Suites have walk-in closets, large bathrooms, separate living areas with sofas, and comfy king size beds. We were wowed!

We arrived at about 8am, and they amazingly had a room ready for us, which was critical since we were very sleep deprived, and were able to refresh before beginning our day out in Paris. The rooms and lobby/public spaces were sparkling clean. Some might think the rooms were small, but as we had booked the smallest (standard), I actually thought they were more than adequately sized, with a large bed and very nice bathroom. We had breakfast included in our package, and we were very impressed with this as well. They had a full range of meats/cheeses/bread, lots of different kinds of fresh fruit, at least 2 different hot dishes each day, and coffee/tea/cappuccinos and juices. They give you a card for a free glass of champaign or wine anytime during your stay, and we also were given some crackers/snacks to munch on from the nice bartender since it was in the evening and he guessed that we hadn't eaten dinner yet. Location: This is about a 5 min. walk from the George V metro stop. It is a bit of a distance from things like the Louvre/Musee d'Orsay/Notre Dame, but about a 10 min walk to the Arc de Triomphe, 12 min. walk to the Seine, a 20 min walk to the Eiffel tower, and again, not from at all from a Metro stop that will get to anywhere very quickly.

As they say, there are no bad dishes in a good restaurant and there should be no bad rooms in a good hotel. The problem with Keppler is that the classic (and even the standard) rooms are so small that they should be considered unacceptable for a 4 star hotel. I know the popular excuse is \"well, this is Paris\" but the truth is that there are plenty of 4 star hotels in Paris with properly-sized rooms, even the most basic ones. Hotel Balzac for example or Hotel de la Tremoille are in the same area but would fit the standards of a 4 star hotel. Keppler's rooms are ridiculously small - in fact, if you open the closet door, it actially hits the bed so that you cannot get out until you close it. The other side of the bed which is near the window is so close in fact that you could not put your foot down at the edge of the bed without hitting your face against the window.

This hotel has a lovely exterior and interior design and has staff that are extremely helpful. It is well equipped for almost all your needs including a fitness gym in the basement, bar, library in a quiet location. Breakfast is a small selection of cereals, pastries, juices, cold meats, cheeses, eggs plus a couple of hot dishes. All the food was fresh and very tasty however was set up for those staying for a short stay as there is no variation (except the two hot dishes) on a day to day basis. Rooms. We stayed in room 102 which overlooks Rue de Keppler. This is a smallish room with a kingsize bed, dressing table plus an en-suite with shower/bath etc. The decor is great and the only real criticism is that the owners have gone for style over substance as the skirting boards in the bathroom are starting to rot as the shower curtain is not big enough and therefore the water splashes over the side and the shower head is too heavy for the fitting and so anyone over 170 cm tall cannot stand underneath it. Staff. The staff are very helpful although their recommendations on food were questionable. They could not do enough for us and were helpful from the moment we arrived to the point they ordered the taxi back to the airport. Overall the hotel is located towards the Arc and therefore is not central but is in a quiet location within a 5 minute walk of the George V metro, a great little hotel in a lovely city which I am sure we will visit again. Wine Tasting at O Chateaux was excellent, boat trip on the Seine is worthwhile, trip up the Eiffel Tower is a must, the Louvre could take a full day to get around so make time.

It was done in shades of lavender, grey, black and white...the bathroom had toile wallpaper -- very chic, very Parisian! We knew it wasn't going to be an overly spacious room but it didn't bother us because we set our expectations ahead of time and thought it was comfortable and cozy. Also, the breakfast was really good. They had a nice spread of pastries and other delicious little French goodies. I would have to say - the part I remember the most was the hotel manager who helped my husband with making the restaurant recommendation for where he would eventually pop the question. Mind you, this guy knows nothing about us but the restaurant he picked was absolutely perfect. When we came back to the room that evening, he had left a bottle of chilled champagne and a congratulatory note. Superb!

We were tired after flying overnight and were immediately offered a shower room to change and freshen up, along with robes, slippers etc. Even though check-in is not until the afternoon, we were told to check back in a couple of hours and they would do their best to have our room ready so my 12 year old could get some sleep. Our room was ready by 10:00 a.m. Our room was standard, but charming and comfortable. The bed and linens were good quality. The room was very clean. If you are looking for a view; there isn't one.

I am allergic to cigarette smoke so I kept the AC off and my window open. The rooms are quite tiny - a bit smaller than other Paris boutique hotels I've stayed in but they are nice rooms.

Location-wise, I thought the hotel was situated on a very quiet street a few blocks from the Arc de Triomphe and a couple of blocks from the nearest train stop. I do wish the hotel was two or three blocks closer to the train, but for three days in Paris, it was fine. As I mentioned, the hotel is on a very small street with no stores for at least a block or two. While that is very nice from a noise standpoint, keep that in mind if you\u2019re going to be out late and coming back to a hotel on a dark street. We originally booked this hotel as part of an expedia package and I selected a Standard Room at the hotel which was supposed to come with a King Bed. Unfortunately, all Superior Rooms only have Queen beds (or as the hotel told me when I checked in, it\u2019s a \u2018European King\u2019). I\u2019m not sure who is to blame for that one, but it really didn\u2019t make much of a difference as the queen bed was fine. I thought the size of the room was quite sufficient and I didn\u2019t feel that it was that small. The bathroom was also of a nice size with decent countertop space. We did however have a complaint about our shower. Similar to the hotel we stayed at in London (so maybe this is a European thing), there really wasn\u2019t any shower door that closed the whole area, so water went everywhere. After each of our showers, the floors and walls couldn\u2019t help but be wet. Another minor grievance was while they provided shampoo, lotion and body wash gel, they didn\u2019t give us any hair conditioner. At the same time, there were no face towels provided in the rooms. One grievance I had with the hotel was the very late cleaning of our rooms each day. We flipped the door sign to indicate we wanted our room cleaned by 9 am each morning, but one day our room wasn\u2019t cleaned until 2 pm and then next day wasn\u2019t until 4:30 pm. It was a little annoying in that we would come back to the room in the mid-afternoon wanting to relax just a bit before we headed out for more sightseeing and we really couldn\u2019t be in the room to relax. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel, so we can\u2019t comment on that aspect, but we did use the business center, and I use the term \u2018business center\u2019 very loosely. There was one terminal (with a printer) that you can use for 30 minutes at 5 Euro. For such a small hotel, I would have hoped that the usage of the computer would have been free. The lobby/foyer was nice, yet small with a lot of knick knacks everywhere. There wasn\u2019t an inch of coffee table space or on the wall that wasn\u2019t taken up by a painting or sculpture. As I mentioned before, I would recommend the hotel to others as I felt the room size was good and I thought the front desk was very nice and welcoming (and also spoke English!).

The hotel itself is of classic Parisienne character and located in a quiet street just minutes from the Arc de Triomphe. Its location also benefits from the Paris transport system, with easy access to the metro, local buses and airport coaches etc. The staff were attentive but unobtrusive and in fairness the reception staff couldn't have done enough for a number of guests whom required their services. The Keppler is tastefully decorated, stylish and elegant. Our room 104 was a standard room but of reasonable size and overlooked the street. The breakfasts were fabulous with everything you could think of available and situated in a delightful room on the hotel's lower level. The other plus point being breakfast was available from 0700hrs to 1100hrs. On the same floor level a steam room and sauna are available though we didn't find the time to utilise these facilities. Bar staff were very friendly and helpful, Keppler also offers room service, which is supplied from a local bistro. There are plenty of cafes, bistros and restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel, and plenty more should you head towards the Champs Elysees. Avoid the Al Ajami Lebanese restaurant, my review of this restaurant is posted on TA. Whilst searching around the streets we stumbled upon an absolute gem of a restaurant called 6 New York. Located on Avenue de New York, it sits on the banks of the Seine and looks out onto the Eiffel Tower, great view when its illuminated and the searchlight pierces the night sky. The Chef/Owner pays you a visit at your table and informs you of the day's specials and takes your order, great personal touch. The food is just perfection, expect to pay in the region of 150 Euros for 2 persons including wine. May sound like a lot but when you consider the prices in Paris, then you truly do \" Only get what you pay for\"! Visit the website www.6newyork.fr.

I have travelled a lot in Europe and elswhere and have never thought to complain about any of my experiences over the last 15 years of travelling. The front of house at Hotel Keppler on the otherhand were unfriendly and given the fact that they knew we were celebrating a special occasion was surprising. At no point did we feel valued customers and the recommendations for restaurants were poor. The rooms are also small and not good value given the price of the same. We had no air conditioning and because the rooms were warm we did not sleep very well for 4 of the 5 nights. Given both myself and my wife lead busy working lives in an international law firm this added further dismay to our trip. There was no pro activity in dealing with this issue.

The area was surrounded by many places to eat, so there was easy access to a restaurant at all times , shop around though, as Paris is very expensive. We took a boat trip along the river Seine and this was an ideal way to do sight seeing. The Eiffel Tower was about 15 minute walk, however, be prepared for long queuing. The service in the hotel was excellent and could not be faulted, our room came with a complimentary bottle of Champagne and nibbles, a huge bed, robes, and all the usual things you would expect if you were in he UK, plus more.

The service in the hotel was excellent and very personalized and our room came with a nice buffet breakfast.

First impression: we arrived at noon and was told that our room would not be available until 7pm because the guest occupying the room was very sick. #1: 7pm check-in is unacceptable, #2: why would we want to stay in a room where someone was VERY sick in? Next they told us we could check-in earlier, but when we arrived in the room, we knew immediately it was not what we reserved (bed was smaller, room was smaller, decor style was obviously a standard room). So we had to go downstairs to the reception again. The check-in manager quickly said that he would reduce the rate by 60 euros. My point is, they obviously couldn't arrange the category of room we reserved and instead of saying honestly that they were putting us in a lower category room and adjusting our rate, they tried to just let it slip by. That's not the kind of service we were expecting. The amount of stress we experienced upon first entering the hotel would definitely deter me from going back. Other details: Yes, hotel is close to Champs Elysees however, the street is very small and quiet at night. A little bit difficult to find in the dark. Room had no luggage racks (they said they would deliver one but never did). The room had virtually no space to accommodate two opened luggages (we had to keep one closed at any point in time). Shower drainage was slow, after a 10 minute shower, there would be 2 inches of water at your feet. Bedding: pillows were airy soft (lacking support), red stain on decorative duvet over the bed.

The private use of the steam and sauna room was a real bonus and the breakast that is supplied is not only fresh but there is plenty of it.

Firstly, we were upgraded to a small suite on our arrival, which was a really unexpected bonus. The suite had a small balcony, and a view of the Eiffel Tower - OK it wasn't the whole tower, but it was really nice to sit out drinking a coffee in the morning, looking over the rooftops of Paris, with the Eiffel Tower in the distance. The room itself was divided into a sitting area, a bedroom, a walk-in wardrobe/dressing area and a bathroom. It wasn't the biggest room I've ever stayed in, that's for sure, but it was stylishly decorated, clean, comfortable and cozy. It also featured all the amenties you'd expect from a modern hotel. The facilities at the hotel were good, but as it's a small hotel converted from a old Parisienne residence, then all the facilities are also small. It has a small bar area, a small breakfast room, a small gym etc. But whilst all are small, they're also perfectly formed. Therefore adding to the ambience of the stay. The continental breakfast buffet is also very good, with a wide selection. The staff were efficient and very friendly, and really made a huge difference to our enjoyment of our trip. Not just with the upgrade, but they handled a delivery for me efficiently, and made dinner reservations at 2 good local restaurants on our behalf, as well as being generally friendly; greeting us every time we came back to the hotel, or stopping for a quick chat to discuss our plans for the day etc. On previous visits to Paris I could never quite understand why people fell so much in love with the city, but having now stayed at the Hotel Keppler where we did not experience any of the 'Parisienne attitude' I can now totally understand the romance and lure of the city, and we'll definitely be going back in the future, and we'll stay at the Hotel Keppler when we do.", "Date": "June 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel...like a B&B but in a city setting!

The pictures on the website are identical to the rooms. We were upgraded to an executive room after the first night in a standard room. The standard room was very small almost claustraphobic! The executive room was a good size and had a bath which was missing in the standard room. (A bath is essential in Paris as you do so much walking you need a good soak when you return from sightseeing). There was a television in the bathroom but its volume didn't function so I asked the concierge to have a look but he forgot. It wasn't that important. The breakfast is very good with a good selction of fruit , cereal, cold meats, cheeses and pastries along with a buffet style hot selection each day. The staff are exceptional and make this hotel stand out from others. Nothing was too much trouble. Their recommendations for restaurants, although pricey, were all fantastic. Le Christine on Rue Christine (LatinQuarter) was very good and well worth a visit. The metro stations are all within easy walking distance and situated on the Champs Elysee (about 5 mins walk away). Location wise the hotel is on a quiet street. Quite a walk from all the major tourist sites but very accessible by the metro. The Champs Elysee and The Arc de Triomphe are very close. The one downer was on our last morning when we awoke to find no hot water from the taps. We phoned reception to ask why; they were unaware of the problem and phoned an engineer. This was our last day and our 30th wedding anniversary !! We had to check out without having a shower or a bath and returned home .

The breakfast was lovely, and I didn't know where to start first. I liked the saucisson and brie (something I would never have for breakfast back home). The staff were very helpful, recommending restaurants for us and printing out maps and addresses for us to follow. The Hotel Keppler is handy for the Champs Elysees, particularly the Arch De Triomph end. Drugstore Publiscis and Lauderee were both fairly close, and with several Metro stations close-by, you can get almost everywhere in Paris fairly quickly. Beds were very comfy and the water was hot.

Because of the size of this property (39 rooms I believe) there is a nice, intimate, feeling to it. They recommended Laduree on the Champs Elysees for one evening when we didn't want a huge meal (of course we brought back their famous macaroons!) and Oscars (several block from the hotel), a neighborhood restaurant another night.

The decor was modern without being tacky and there was a real attention to detail. Everything was just so clean and in perfect condition. The reception area is beautiful and our classic room was very stylish and comfortable. The room was adequate in size, considering the typical size of Paris accommodation. The sound insulation was also great - we remained completely undisturbed throughout our stay. We made use of the Hammam and Sauna while we were there and it felt like a private spa! I think the only slight criticism would be that the shower in our room was not very powerful, but hot water was plentiful and that really is a minor criticism in the spirit of giving a balanced review! Breakfast: Breakfast was available from 8-11am, which was very convenient. There was lots of good food on offer and I'm sure the extended choice would cater to most tastes. The breakfast room is also beautifully decorated, in keeping with the rest of the hotel. Location: We have visited Paris on 5 previous occasions and have primarily stayed in St Germain area, which we love. Although this remains our favourite district, the Keppler is in a great location on the Right Bank, very near to the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees. The metro is a 5 minute walk away, so the rest of Paris is very accessible too. At night, the area is quiet and feels very safe. Staff: The staff were very helpful throughout our stay - not something that we have always found during our stays in Paris! Phillipe on reception deserves a special mention. We were going to a gig in the suburbs of Paris one night and he did a lot of research on our behalf into bus and train timetables!

By the way, if you like Indian food there is a great Indian place (Ratn) few blocks from the hotel.....delicious.", "Date": "February 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hexham Northumberland", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Farmertomless", "ReviewID": "UR23546056", "Content": "Beautiful Hotel in an excellent Location.

The hotel is exactly what I expected from other reviewers comments.

I booked \"Standard\" room through online travel agency but room was extremely small and asked front desk if this is really standard or not. He looks a little bit hesitate and said \"smallest size of our Standard Room\". I asked may be this is your \"Classic\" room but he didn't change his comment. So, I was not sure at that time whether my room is really Standard or Classic, I gave up to ask anymore. However after I returned from my trip, I saw my room was \"Classic\" in their web site. I guess this is because of my price from Agoda which was quite cheaper than all other web site for Standard. If front desk told me the true reason, may be I'm not so regret with considering how much I paid. So, I have to downgrade the rate -1.0 for small size and another -1.0 for not telling me the true story. Classic rooms are located from floor 1-4 and room number's are 3 and 5.

As it was our 25th anniversary, a nice bottle of bubbly was chilling in our room when we arrived. We ended up in an Executive Room on the 3rd floor. It faced the courtyard which is actually quite pleasant. Without exaggeration, it was THE QUIETEST room I've ever stayed in. I can say that because I travel with a mini recording studio and microphone. The air-conditioning seeps through an unobtrusive vent above the bed and doesn't make a sound either. A real bonus for me and my midnight recording session hookups back to the States. The staff was fabulous. Especially Phillipe. You might think this strange, but we never even looked at the breakfast room. Its not that I'm cheap. Well, okay, so I'm a little cheap... but I really prefer eating the way the locals do.

We pre-paid the hotel in US Dollars and that helped tremendously. We booked a standard room and as others have said, they are beautifully decorated. The rooms appear to be very clean and the beds are comfortable. We had a street side room but, I didn't notice much noise which was great! When I spoke to the concierge about the lovely decor, he told me it was done by the same designer who did the George V. Just to set your expectations, the rooms are VERY small which is somewhat to be expected in Europe. My guess is that our room was about 10' x 12' + a small entrance hallway and bathroom. Our room had two very small wardrobes so pack light! We were thankful it was summer so our clothes weren't bulky. For us the room was fine because we just used it as a place to sleep. The rooms all have slightly different color themes, throws and softgoods but, for the most part they look exactly as pictured on their website. As previous posters have mentioned, there really isn't anywhere to put your suitcases. We stashed ours in the little alcoves in front of the two windows. For those who are traveling in the summer, the AC in this hotel is excellent! It's probably the best I've ever experienced at any hotel in Paris. Problem was, the 5 days we were there it was unseasonably cold so we didn't need it. An expanded continental bufftet breakfast is included with the rate. This includes juice, a variety of coffees & teas, yogurt, fruit, cereals, eggs, breakfast meat and potatoes. They also offer to cook omlets and eggs to order. In addition, they bring each table a basket of fresh breads and pasteries. Breakfast was served from 7-11am and I believe you can have it in your room as well? We never did this so I can't comment on what you get but I'd assume it's the same. The poster who said that cab drivers in Paris have no idea where the street is located, is correct. Our driver from the airport entered the address info into his GPS and he still couldn't find the hotel. I had printed a copy of the map from the hotels website and handed it to the driver and he still had trouble finding the street! Make sure you bring a map with you just in case the driver can't find it. I know our map helped the driver and he did eventually figure it out but the costs start to add up while he's driving around looking for the little side street. I know many people have RAVED about the staff at this hotel. They were fine but, I wouldn't go overboard raving about them. When asked, they will of course answer questions and make recommendations. I just didn't think they go out of their way to help. I know it's not the George V, but still. I have stayed at other hotels in Paris where the staff really did go out of their way to be friendly and helpful but, we didn't have the same experience as others have. To their credit however, they did make all our restaurant reservations, which was very helpful. My cell phone died earlier in the trip so I was not able to make my own dinner reservations. For the most part I knew what restaurants we planned to eat at so it was just a matter of the concierge phoning each restaurant. They also did make one very good restaurant recommendation---Marco Polo, a somewhat casual Italian Restaurant in the St Germain area. The restaurant was excellent and I'd go back in a heartbeat! This hotel is very central if you're a tourist. It's about a 5 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe & Champs Elysees and maybe 10 to 15 minutes to the Eiffel Tower. The hotel is located in the 16th Arrond but very close to the 8th. We also had an issue with housekeeping during our stay. The hotel encourages everyone to be \"green\" and reuse towels, which is fine. We used ours for 2 days and then put them in the tub to signal the housekeeper to replace them since my DH had come down with a cold. I was told by the housekeeping staff that there was a problem and they didn't have any bath towels. In lieu of the bath towels she gave me 2 hand towels! Later I ran into another housekeeper in the hall and she told me they still didn't have any towels. This went on for the remainder of our stay. So for 3 days we went without bath towels. Each day we'd come back to change for dinner, I'd look in the bathroom and there would be no bath towels. That got irritating. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel. I personally am not in love with the location but, I knew that going into it. I'd be hard pressed to beat the price we paid thru GTAHOTELS so it made this hotel hard to pass up.

Overall, I really enjoyed my stay in the hotel. The decor was wonderful, and the conceige and bell-boy are both very helpful. But, I do have a few things to point out: 1. I had no soap in my bathroom until the last day of my stay. Not sure why that's the case, but I had to go hunt for a bar of soap on my first day in Paris 2. One of the days, when the maid cleaned our room, she took all the towels that was on the floor and didn't replace them. However, when I called housekeeping for additional towels, they were delivered immediately. 3. And I did discover some hair strand on the throw that does not belong to me, which is a bit disturbing. I understand the throw might be difficult to clean at times, and the dirt is quite noticable when the throw is white. But, I think the hotel should make an effort to clean the throws, especially when the customers are being charged a premium for the rooms.

It was simply the best trip I have had anywhere in ages, thanks in no small part to the fantastic service at the Keppler. I certainly won't be trying out any other hotel in Paris any time soon. In the interests of full disclosure - a couple of things you should know about the hotel: * The rooms are small, even by Parisian standards. They are fine if you are planning to be out and about for most of the time (and why wouldn't you, this is Paris!), but there isn't much space to work for example, or sit down anywhere other than the bed. * Whilst our room was beautifully decorated and spotless, the design of the wardrobe doors isn't very smart. In a small space, a sliding door would have enabled good access to the wardrobe - instead it has folding doors which can't quite open because the bed is in the way. * Rue Kepler is a quiet side street and most taxi drivers don't have a clue where it is. Ask for \"Rue du Bassano, pres d'Avenue Marceau\" and Rue Kepler is on the right. Now for the main plus points (there are more, but the review would be too long): * The design is funky, but well thought through. There are comfortable places to sit in the common areas, with a mix of books and magazines in English, French and other languages. * Really good triple glazing in the rooms. You can't hear a thing outside when the windows are closed. * The bar is small and you wouldn't want to spend all evening there, but the cocktails are excellent. You almost feel like they are being made for you in your own front room. * Good breakfast by Parisian standards, and the breakfast room is light and welcoming (despite being sub-ground) thanks to a clever atrium/lightwell. * Even though the hotel was full when we stayed, we rarely saw other guests and there were no queues for reception on arrival or departure. Really felt like we were one of the only people at the hotel. * Finally and most importantly, the amazing staff. Nothing was too much trouble, whether it was finding us a reservation at a 2* Michelin restaurant for dinner, or recommending a day trip, or returning some lost property to us. Phillipe and Roman, in particular, could not have been more helpful or charming and really made the stay for us.", "Date": "May 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambs, UK", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "LMR56", "ReviewID": "UR16251115", "Content": "We have just returned from 3 nights at Hotel Keppler with our daughter having gone there to celebrate her 21st birthday. We had a very warm welcome including a surprise birthday present - quality toiletries and half bottle of champagne which was very much appreciated! We had the penthouse which is beautifully decorated with two bedrooms (one quite small but with a very large bed and the other with views of the Eiffel Tower), a lounge area and two excellent bathrooms. The mini TV screens in the bathroom mirrors were a real novelty. There were flatscreen TVs in each room plus a dvd, ipod speakers and internet access (for a charge). We found the penthouse very quiet and extremely comfortable with excellent beds. The whole hotel is wonderfully decorated, the breakfast was excellent (although not included) and the staff very helpful with good English. We only had one grumble, that we found it difficult to get a drink on our return each evening and when we did, it was very expensive! The ice machine was broken and we didn't even get lemon in our luke warm G&T. The person on duty couldn't apparently open a bottle of wine so we gave up and resorted to the mini-bar which unfortunately hadn't been restocked! If the bar had been better we would certainly have given an excellent rating and we will definitely go back there if we return to Paris!", "Date": "May 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Teesside UK", "Title": "\u201cThanks To All In The Keppler Team....\u201d", "Author": "MikeCratchley", "ReviewID": "UR16244533", "Content": "A heartfelt thanks to all the truly professional people working at the Keppler who helped to make our stay in Paris a truly memorable one. From the moment we walked through the door and discovered that the organisation through which we booked (Federal) had mysteriously cancelled our two rooms, we realised that we were in the hands of people who truly understand what hotel-keeping is really all about. Within a few minutes the problem was resolved (and it had nothing to do with the Keppler) and we were shown to our Standard rooms - which were way beyond what i would describe as 'standard'. Everything, apart from the size, is truly superb. If you really need lots of room, then book a suite. Whatever we asked for, from room service to help and advice on where to go and where to eat, was responded to with enthusiasm and expert knowledge - so refreshing for a city not known for such caring and hospitality. My only beef is that it is in a commercial area where not much is open in the immediate vicinity after around 11.00pm - although you don't have to walk too far to find it! The Keppler is one of Paris's real treasures, so thanks to all of the previous reviewers who encouraged us to make it our home from home.", "Date": "May 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful!\u201d", "Author": "Philleas_Fogg_uette", "ReviewID": "UR16227095", "Content": "This hotel is faultless.
