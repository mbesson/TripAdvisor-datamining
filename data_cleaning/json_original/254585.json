(there were 5 of us). we went out for the day and arrived back at 5pm, we went to our room not expecting much as we had read some of the bad reviews. We had a family room for 5 located in the basement, the room was great, we had 3 single beds and a double with ensuite shower room, the room was large enough for us all to feel comfortable in it. We did have a window in the room but it only overlooked a very small square space, but we were not there to stay in our room and admire the view so it did not bother us. The room itself was very clean and comfortable. All the bedding was clean, and beds very comfortable with extra pillows in wardrobe.

My specific requirement was a central London single occupancy accommodation at the best rate, including breakfast. The Montana Hotel provided ideal accomodation for me. Staying in central London can be expensive at any time of the year. The Montana is a smaller four/five storey hotel located at the heart of Kensington & Chelsea and close to Gloucester Road tube station. The hotel offers good value room rates including continental breakfast, ideal for short stay visitors to London where no more than basic \u2018Bed & Breakfast\u2019 type facilities are required. My room was a very comfortable single with standard room facilities including a wash basin, TV and internet, no en-suite, the shared bathroom was a short walk down the corridor. I enjoyed my continental breakfast in the restaurant, a dining room which becomes the \u2018Light of India\u2019 restaurant for evening dining, acknowledged to be one the very best restaurants for Indian cuisine in Kensington.

We expected the usual \"rabbit hutch\" sized room that is the norm for budget - moderate hotels in central London but were very pleasantly surprised to find our twin room quite spacious. The bathroom was also a reasonable size and had the luxury of a bath (as well as the shower overhead). The beds were comfy, there was a wardrobe and room to place your suitcases. The decor is somewhat dated but all is clean and comfortable. The absolute best thing about the hotel is its' location - within easy walking distance of (for example) the V & A, the Science Museum and Harrods. The Montana is just 4 minutes walk from the Glouster Road Tube stop. The hotel is within minutes of many useful amenities - cafe's, pubs, Tesco Express, Waitrose (behind the Tube station), patisseries, greengrocers and restaurants. Almost directly opposite the hotel is a Post Office/tourist centre and a few doors along from that an internet cafe (the biggest problem I had with the Montana was that the wi-fi constantly dropped out). Also opposite are Barclays bank ATMs. The hotel itself is on a very busy road but you barely hear the traffic in your room. The hotel has a good sized lift. The Montana is clean and spacious, the staff were, on the whole, cheerful and helpful - especially the breakfast staff. The breakfast included is a simple but ample meal of cereal, tinned fruits, toast and toppings, coffee or tea - as much as you can eat and drink. A cooked breakfast can be purchased if you wish. The breakfast is served in the \"Light of India\" restaurant which is attached to the hotel. We also had dinner here one night - it was very good and quite reasonably priced for a London restaurant. Just a small 'heads up', the Montana does not provide bathroom toiletries of any kind (apart from tiny soaps) nor does it provide any bathroom linen apart from bath-towels. I did find this a bit strange, but necessity being the mother of invention, solved our problem by buying some \"Chux wipes\" at the Waitrose supermarket and using them as bath mats and hand towels. Plenty of loo paper was provided in the bathroom. Also, when we arrived there were no tea-making facilities in the room but a call to reception had a tray delivered within minutes. Altogether we found this a very comfortable and convenient base to explore the area of London we most wished to see.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Experience\u201d", "Author": "Kim K", "ReviewID": "UR121651048", "Content": "During my parents first trip to visit London we booked rooms here for a weekend in November to show them how wonderful London was, unfortunately we picked the worst hotel. The rooms were absolutely awful. No toiletries offered except for a small bar of hand soap and one roll of toilet paper. There was a step up into the bathroom from the room, not only did I trip/slip over it getting out of the shower, because there wasn't a bathmat in the bathroom, but my child did as well. The bed covers were dirty and had dust around the bottom edges. The room was extremely stuffy and we opened the window, but because the traffic on the street was so loud we could not sleep with the windows open. We thought our room was bad, but when we went up to the next floor where my parents room was located, their room was even smaller and smelled of damp and mold. My husband went to complain about the rooms and the man on the front desk laughed in his face as if my husband was joking. When my husband asked to speak to the manager, he was told that it wouldn't be possible, and that the front desk man would call the manager. This was the first night we stayed, we had to stay one more night after this and were given dirty looks by the staff for the extent of our stay. The front desk man said that the manager would get in touch with my husband by phone, he never did, and we emailed the hotel to discuss the situation and no one has gotten back with us. We gave them a month to respond to us about receiving a discount/money back on our stay, and haven't received satisfaction to this day, so I'm writing this review. I've taken it upon myself to let friends and colleagues know what a horrible experience we received so they wont stay here. My parents have also let a local paper where they live back in America know how horrible the experience was, as well as several social medial sites. I know that this review will also be laughed at as this is apparently the \"norm\" for the staff here at the Montana.

From October 17,2011 to October 24,2011 Airport to Hotel: We landed at Gatwick airport.....From the airport we took the Gatwick Express train to Victoria station which took about 30-35 min. I suggest to take the Anytime Return ticket. It cost \u00a330.80 per person but if you book it on line it cost \u00a325.90.... This is the web site to book on line: http://www.gatwickexpress.com/en/tickets-and-fares/buy-online-and-save/....Now from Victoria station you take the tube on the distract line three stations to Gloucester station its about 10 min. When exiting Gloucester station the hotel is practically across the street from the station about half a block to the left. I had a friend from Italy that met us up from for the weekend that landed at Heathrow airport. He explained to me that he took the tube from the terminal Heathrow station which is located on the Piccadilly Line straight to Gloucester station it took him 45 min to an hour. Location: Great location.... Your close to some of the major attractions . 5 min. walk to Natural History Museum (Must see place) . 7 min walk to Albert Hall .10 min walk to Hyde Park (Beautiful and very!,Very!!,Very!!! Big Park big, nice swans in the pond) . 15 min walk to Harrods Department store (Incredible store, Very good food in the food court, Hope you have lots of money.....Very expensive to shop. Besides the attractions yo have a little mall across the street with a big grocery store and a few restaurants. In front of the hotel is a little souvenir shop where you can bye post cards, phone cards etc....You have Starbucks,Burger King,K.F.C close by. A grocery store that is opened 24 hours a day. It has good beer selection but be advised you only can't buy alcohol after 11:00 p.m. Coffee shops and a couple of PUBS that close around 10:00 p.m. ATM machines right around the corner and one next to the 24 hour grocery store store. Rooml: We were staying in room 205.... It consist of a small fridge & safe. Double bed & single bed,nice LCD TV that only catches a few channels but you can order movies if you like. Phone where you can make In & Out calls but it cost money to make outs call even though your calling people in the city of London. Big Long Desk,Big Closet,cofffee maker. As for the bathroom it had a little shower, the water pressure is decent but not great. Toiilet & sink and hair dryer.... The room is very! Very!! small but clean the maids come in every morning to make up the beds give you new towels and soap... If you wanted an extra towel just let the maid know. All in all great room bed is comfortable and and you have clean sheets every day. They have free wi fi... and it always worked. Just need to go to front desk to access it. The only problems we had in the room was the T.V. Sometimes it was not working. Staff could not fix it. But we were not there to watch T.V.... One of my friends that was with me on this trip lost or got his watch stolen. It was the only thing missing in the room. WEIRD Sleep: Quiet place to get a good night sleep. No distractions what so ever. Hotel: Check in was fast.....The staff is great and helpful. Front desk has maps of the city and the tourist guides of the city. Don't be shy with the staff they know the city well and they will tell you what to check out. There is this one staff member at the front desk. I forgot his name he's bald with glasses but he was really helpful, ask him about the strip-joints in London... He's going to tell you a hell of a story. They have a 'Lions Bar' in the lobby but we did not try it. They have a computer right next to it but never worked. Elevator is small can fit 2 -3 people depending your size....lol... I think my friend broke it at one point when he startled to jump up and down in it. Restaurant: Breakfast: Not much variety...Three types of cereal,(canned) peaches and pears,Orange & Apple Juice... White & brown toast always hot with some types of jam,Banana's All the Tea & coffee you can drink. You can order eggs or sausage but it's an extra. All-in-All it's a decent breakfast and the waiters are helpful on the refills. For lunch and dinner its an Indian restaurant, we did not get the chance to eat there as we always ate out. Over-all I give this hotel 3.5 STARS.... by the way I'm a picky person. Remember to shut the curtains before you go to bed You really got to know where to go to eat. Very expensive city. I would not recommend to eat in the vicinity unless its Harrods Department store. My favourite place to eat was in Camden town in the market area.... So much to choose from and for a great price.... For \u00a35 you have a massive plate of food, the only thing its a 30 min travel time by tube but worth the trip. Over-all I give this hotel 3.5 STARS.... by the way I'm a picky person.

When choosing a location several things were very important to me: cost needed to be reasonable, location to the subway needed to be very close, and we wanted to be close to the Victoria area of London. The Montana Hotel was the best choice for us - after hours of online searching for hotels. We had a very nice room for 4 people. It had a double bed and 2 singles. The bathroom was large enough with a sink, toilet, and bathtub with shower. The location was excellent. It was quite literally across the street and 1/2 a block down from the Gloucester Road Tube Station on both the Cirle and District Lines. This is 3 stops down (or about 5 minutes away) from Victoria Station. We are able to get a flight into Gatwick, and then took that Gatwick Express to Victoria, and transferred to the Tube to get to our hotel. Very easy, even for a parent on their own who had never been to London, with luggage and 3 kids under 10 in tow. My girls absolutely loved the tiny lift which barely fit the 4 of us and 2 small suitcases. Personally, if you were were claustrophobic - I would opt for the stairs! Our room was on the 3rd floor. It was very nice and very quite. We had breakfast in the restaurant each day, and didn't order any extras and were satisfied until lunch. The coffee and tea were unending, and there was a very nice selection of cereal, toast and (canned) peaches and pears, along with melon. Orange and apple juice were also available. We did not see the need to order more. Our room was ready when we arrived at 10am, however it would not have been a problem to store our luggage there before or after check out, so that we could start our vacation.

The lift is very small, only hold 2 people or 1 person with 2 bags, we start our journey up to the 3rd floor, my keycard does not work, my wife and the girls access there room, its been cleared out, no suit cases, no cloths, no dirty cloths, no jewelry, no nothing. We all race down stairs in a major panic, reception then informs us that the family room has been cleaned up and they have decided to move us to our original booking, house keeping packed up all our belongings\u2026\u2026.talk about being violated and an invasion of privacy especially for the 3 girls, worst was yet to come, in my room was the safe containing 5 passports and cash. They would not allow us to gain access to that room as they had checked in other guests and did not want to disturb them, well I went off and the fun and games started for the next 2 hours\u2026.at this point please use your imagination. To cut a very long story short this is the out come, stuff the other guests get me in or police will be called, found out it was illegal for them to touch or move our items to another room with out our permission, we did not accept the family room at that point out of principle, plus there were still large yellow water stains in the ceiling tiles and they were still wet, the guests in my room did give me access to \u201cthere\u201d room so I could access the safe, they actually saw the happenings in reception. I made the receptionist phone the manager, he said it was just a lack of communication, he would not come to the hotel to speak to me, he actually was never at the hotel during our 5 days, we were advised that even though the had given us 2 rooms we should just accept what we had booked, that was not happening, after more shouting, and proving it was illegal for the staff to move our items they gave us another 2 rooms, at the family rate. With the exception of the incident, I can say the Montana Hotel is a nice place to stay in a nice area, but after what had happened to my family, I will tell everyone to avoid the hotel like the plague, the staff are deceitful, liars, the manager/owner accepts no responsibility for the actions of his staff or his own. How can you touch the personal items of guests and just move them, pack there items into KFC bags, be more concerned about other guests that now have your room.

We weren't very pleased because at the special requests we had asked to be on the same floor and once there they told us we wouldn't even be in the same hotel ! So the receptionist said he was trying to find 2 other rooms in a hotel, at a higher standard. so he sent us in the same street, 15 mn away from the Montana. When we arrived there we found a filthy room with torn curtains, no carpet on the floor and a dirty bathroom. so we decided not to stay there and went back to the Montana. They finally found 2 rooms in the hotel next door which was being renewed but the rooms were brand new and that time the standard of the hotel was higher, indeed. As a result we lost nearly 3 hours trying to get a suitable accomodation I had booked for in January for the 3 couples. and the receptinist asked me to stay calm .. oh, I forgot while we were waiting at the reception another family arrived and got two rooms still avalable in the hotel.

Walking distance you can get to Kensington Park or to the V&A and a little further, Harrods!

While researching the possible hotel options we saw the mixed reviews on the Montana and thought we would give it a chance. I have stayed in some scummy motels and hotels before so we had no expectations for the Montana. I have been to London before and knew the area was fantastic so we didn't expect to spend any time in the hotel room at all. When we first got into the hotel it seemed very nice. No ones room was ready from our group so we were told to leave our bags in the back and go explore the area while we waited, which is exactly what we did. Two hours later when we returned from lunch we discovered that our room still wasn't ready. So we waited another hour and we finally were placed in a room. Now I have never seen a hotel with basement rooms but we were exhausted and willing to give it a chance. The room was very dirty and had only one window which was a fire exit. The sheets had black smears on them, the wall paper was torn, and the room felt like a storage area with all the extra furniture. But the reason we asked for a new room was the sewage smell. The bathroom was disgusting! The shower had brown sludge all over the base and walls and the toilet paper had black smears on it. Which was probably due to the towels, toilet paper and sheets being stored on the floor in the hallways outside the rooms. (A fact that we asked about at the front desk and were told that they never did, despite the pictures I had taken.) When we went upstairs to see if they had any other rooms, we were told that they had no openings and that we would have to ask the next day but they didn't think it would be possible. They also sent someone down to look at the bathroom, which proved to be useless. The man told us \"the smell was a mixture of perfume and cigarettes\" so we knew we were stuck in the room. Feeling a little used I decided to call Air Transat and see if there was anything they could do since we paid for a 5 star hotel and got a 2. Immediately after I had called Air Transat we got a call from the front desk saying that they had a room for us. We were moved to a room on the top floor which was much nicer than the first. The bathroom was clean and we had actual windows! From then on the staff were nice, unlike they were at the beginning. The front desk clerk told me when we were moved to \"immediately call Air Transat and tell them you are very happy with your room\" which I found a little weird since we hadn't even seen the room yet. But the next day as we walked downstairs we ran into another guest as he was yelling at the front desk clerk. Apparently he had gotten a room like our old basement room and had paid $500 for it. So we were happy to see that others were equally as disgusted by the shape of the rooms. But all in all after the first day and that horrible room mishap we had a very nice stay. If you ever stay here MAKE SURE you get a 4th floor room! They still store their linens on the floor in the hallways but somehow they seem to clean the rooms better. The breakfast is amazing and the wait staff is very nice! They always remembered our orders and never let our coffee's go empty. If you do stay here, stay for the area and not for the hotel! The tube is literally a 2 minute walk from the hotel and they have some good restaurants around for a quick snack along with a bakery, a grocery store and of coarse a couple of pubs!

I always like the excellent location right in Kensington and across from the Gloucester Road Tube. For the price, you really can't beat that location. This time I stayed in a room with two twin beds. We were fortunate to be put in a room on the back of the hotel, something that has never happened on my previous stays there. The back of the hotel over looks a mews and is MUCH quieter than the front side on the corner of Gloucester/Cromwell Roads. My complaints this time were with the cleanliness and size of the room. This is England, so I expected the rooms to be small but our bathroom was extremely tiny. I've stayed in other twin rooms at this hotel and they had much larger bathrooms compared to what we were given. You could basically only stand up in it and turn around and that's it. The shower had black mold growing in the corners and edges and I didn't really enjoy that but I put up with it since we were only staying for one night. My other problem was with the staff. Before we arrived they quoted me a discount rate and I had emails to confirm that I booked the room at that rate. They seemed hesitant to give it to me upon check-in and wanted to charge me more. They said I would have to bring it up upon check-out. That was annoying because for the next day I had to worry about it and keep reminding myself to bring it up with the staff again upon check-out. They seemed hesitant to give me the rate at check out again, and I had to pull out my paperwork to show them what they had quoted me and that I had reserved that rate. Finally they gave it to me. But, all the time they took and the questioning they gave me about how why they had quoted me that rate left a bad taste in my mouth. I would stay here again just because it is in a neighborhood that I like and because it includes free breakfast. But, just be aware that the rooms in this hotel vary significantly: you could end up with a larger and noisy room or a really small room like we had this time that is quieter.

From our perspective you don't see anything in the tube but one thing when you are on holidays and you have time it is a beautiful walk and it's only about 45 mins. to an hour to these areas. We do recommend that you try the Big Bus Tour, great value for what you all see and it's a hop on hop off with a city cruise on the river Thames.

And up the street 5 minutes there is a convenience store that sells all kinds of food that has really late hours. I believe it is called Tesco. The Red Leicester cheese there is excellent. Far better than any cheddar I've had here in the states. So make good use of those in room refrigerators. The pluses are the staff for the most part are very friendly. The little English guy with glasses seemed a bit off putting. The continental breakfast that is served in the mornings in their dining room is very good. I was served hot toast and coffee by the young oriental girls working there. Nice smiles and cute. The toast was the best I have ever had with a choice of jelly and preserves. The fruit that was cut was cantaloupe and honey dew melon. Coming from the states I expected it to be unripe and pretty much inedible. Boy was i surprised. It was excellent . Cereal and juices are also available at the bar. There is really no need to spend any money for breakfast. It was so good. A perfect way to start the day. And all of this on linen table clothes. A little more about the room. We had a single bed and a double bed in our room. My bed seemed to sleep nicely. It was a bit warm in the room but I put that up to my roommate who set the thermostat.. You might need to be a bit agile in getting in the tube for a shower. There is a bit of a step into the tube. So if you are a little bit iffy in the mobility department you may have trouble. But I am told that they don't know how to do showers in England so you may have this issue elsewhere. Our companions who were in room 106 said that their water was not hot. I did not get a full understanding of the exact nature of this problem. Let me recommend the Van Gogh exhibition at the Royal Academy of Art. for those that will be in London before April 17th. I think that's when it ends. It was amazing. I was told it would be an hour and a half wait to get in and I went on a Friday night about 6:00 and waited only 5 minutes Pay the extra few pounds and do the audio tour. The highlight of my trip! That and the wonderful people! Let me say that London is a wonderful place that was made even better by my stay at the Montana Hotel .I will be staying there if I get back that way.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cNice, basic accommodation\u201d", "Author": "ALBinWDC", "ReviewID": "UR57410938", "Content": "I stayed at the Montana Hotel for 3 nights in February 2010.

Even though I arrived earlier than the posted check-in time, they had my room ready and waiting for me. And what a pleasant surprise of a room it was! The last couple of times I've stayed in London, I was at another hotel in the same area where I was put in a dark, cramped, grimy room barely big enough for one single bed. But at the Montana, my room (number 311) was clean and bright, and spacious. The bathroom was small, but not uncomfortably so. I requested a tub, and it was large, with plenty of space for soaps and shampoos. As mentioned in previous reviews, this hotel does not provide shampoo, which is not an issue with me as I prefer my own brand. They did provide a small bar of soap and two towels. The soap and towels were replaced daily. There is a Boots and grocery store in the tube station shopping arcade across the street, where you can buy anything else you need. Another nice touch was the mirrored medicine cabinet and glass-holder built into the wall. There room had its own thermostat control, and the A/C worked very well. The room had a queen and a single bed, a large window overlooking a charming residential street behind the hotel, and more drawers and electrical outlets than I could use. The plugs are British-style only, so you'll need adapters if you're from another country. I bought a couple inexpensive ones at Boots. There was also a good-sized wardrobe, where the room safe was tucked away. I bought soda and pre-made sandwiches, and fruit from the nearby grocery stores, and kept them in the mini-fridge. This left me more money for shows and other attractions! The elevator is indeed small, but large enough for my friend and I to go up together with our (carry-on sized) bags. My first night there, I discovered that the bathtub drain was broken. I called it in the next morning, and the maintenance was there within the hour. He replaced the entire drain unit and it was perfect for the rest of my stay. He, and the rest of the staff, were very polite and friendly. As others have noted, the location of this hotel can't be beat. The Gloucester Road station is right across the street. Don't forget to look BOTH ways, and watch out for vehicles turning left around the corner from Gloucester Road onto Cromwell Road - they have the right of way, even on red! It's a straight shot from Heathrow airport on the Piccadilly line (both ways took me less than 30 minutes). The station is also served by Circle and District lines. The wide-screen TV was really nice, especially as it came with FREE music and movies on demand. Loved it. There was also a good variety of channels available, including the various BBC stations, ITV, Channel 5, and a few other cable choices. The TV also had a clock and wake-up alarm built into it, which you set with the remote control. The man at the front desk gave me a slip of paper with the wifi network key so I could use the free Internet. You have to set your connection to key index 2, which I suspect flummoxes some guests ... especially those with Macs using OSX, as it only supports key index 1! However, I was using a netbook with Windows XP and got hooked up without any problems. The connection was on the slow side, but perfectly adequate for checking e-mail and looking up addresses on Google maps.

Yes the elevator was small (me and my big bag only fit in it at one time) but we were on the second floor so walked up all the time.the hotel is only a 7 minute walk to Kensington Palace, Gardens and plenty of teen girl shopping nearby!! the breakfast was just toast and cereal and juice,tea etc but unlimited and good enough several mornings for us. We did 2 Golden bust tours from the hotel and were very happy with both the guides and the meals included. We arrived FRiday April 17 in the rain, then had perfect spring weather for the rest of the 10 days.On the Tuesday we travelled by train to Buxton to visit Chatsworth on the Wednesday, however, when we arrived at the Buckingham Hotel with nothing to do at 2 p.m. on Tuesday the front desk receptionist suggested a climb past the Poole caverns to something called Solomon's Temple. It was so worth it and my 18 year old daughter called this the best part of her entire trip. A small fort set high in with peak district surrounding you with magnificent views. Chatsworth was beautiful my personal favourite of the trip, a must see for all romantic English lovers.WE took the Eurostar to Paris on the Friday, the train was fine the Metro dirty and smelly, the Eiffel tower up the stairs was lovely though tiring ,walked from there to the Musee D'Orsay then the Louvre the on to the Notre Dame and back the same day to LOndon, finishing with high tea at the Orangery at Kensington Palace.

It was actually amazing that they managed to fit a toilet, tiny sink and shower cubicle in such a small space! One thing they didn't manage to fit in was a hand towel. Decor was abit dated, but the flatscreen TV with freeview was pretty cool. Breakfast is advertised as continental, but I'm not sure if I'd class cereal and toast as continental? Chuck in a few pastries!! Cooked brekkie was available at an extra cost. Didn't visit the hotel bar, but did visit the Indian restaurant which was quite nice. 10% discount for hotel guests.

We loved the Montana. The front desk staff, restaurant staff, housekeeping were all friendly and helpful. Its a great location; we felt very safe there. From previous reviews we knew the hotel was an older budget property; which it was. I found it charming and would stay there again. Three elevator trips to our rooms on the 3rd floor. Our teenagers had a small room with two tandem twin beds; a huge bathroom with tub & shower facing the street. Some traffic noise was heard at night. Our room was acros the hall. a little more space, double bed, and the tinest bathroom, shower only, I have ever seen. A good sized and quality towel with a little bar of soap (no shampoo etc) was left for each person on the bed. I called the fron desk for extra towels and a tea tray. Each day extra towels were left and the tea tray refilled. Breakfast hours are short and later on Sundays and bank holidays. Continental breakfast included coffee, tea or hot chocolate; two slices of toast, two cereal choices, milk, juice and water (maybe tap, if you order water at a restaurant in London or Paris, they bring you an expensive 500ml/16oz water bottle). If not included with your room this was less than 5 pounds (and when you see the price of coffee and size elsewhere, it might seem like a bargain). There are sit down restaurants, Starbucks, Burger King across the street. Each room had a fridge and we kept them stocked from the Waitrose grocery store. Boots (drugstore) also had a decent combo price on a pre-made sandwich/drink/snack. If you have any food allergies or a picky eater I suggest taking a picnic lunch for out of town trips as we found it was tricky for find food for one of our children. The underground is diagonally across the street; Picadilly, Circle, and District lines. Picadilly is quite deep, you will have 30 steps before accessing an elevator to bring you to street level. Circle and District have 36 steps to the street. Very convenient for transport from Heathrow or the trains. Choose an Oster Card or Travel Card (read London Tube reviews on TripAdvisor). We purchased Hop On Hop Off bus vouchers from the hotel. A stop was barely a half block away. I had purchased London Pass vouchers from Canada. It was NOT a good value for us; seeing more than 3 attractions in a day was too ambitious. Had to exchange the voucher in London for the pass - short hours for pick up. The London Pass may save you time in line-ups to purchase separate admissions; reseach if the Hop On Hop Off people let you skip queus as they sell tickets at their stops that are close to attractions. Good maps for when you exit the underground would be helpful. You can be pushed, shoved, stepped on, and rolled over on by luggage or strollers. Its hard to get your bearings as street signs can be on a fence, the building, or nowhere to be found; when you're being swept along by crowds. Not all areas where crowded; just be prepared. Harrods is one of the crowded areas, in the store itself! a 20 minute walk or a quick underground trip.

So much is wrong with this place I don't even know where to start. Perhaps I should start with the good bits, as it's easier since there are only two: free wireless internet access and location. The location is very good, near the tube station, cafes, shops etc in a trendy part of town. Granted though, this may not be for everyone. While it may be good for people doing business in the area or even in central London, tourists may prefer to stay somwhere else closer to the main sights. But overall, I don't think you can fault this location. Now on the bad bits. The room is as warm and welcoming as guantanamo bay. It's old, tired, slightly smelly and extremely basic. The bathrrom was designed for very tiny people, the shower is pokey and the water pressure is so so. For 100 pounds all I got was some old soap by the way, so remember to bring everything else. The lift is small and slow and always stinks of something different (if it's not tobacco it's garlic or farts - it's just revolting). Staff at reception looks bored and uninspired. I asked for an iron and they said they were all out; didn't even volunteer to let me know when one was back. They always want your key when you leave the hotel, which I find annoying and unsafe. Breakfast entails tea or coffee, corn flakes, and four burnt slices of toast. For some extra money you could order something else but I didn't dare! The restaurant area looked very unwelcoming, and the table cloths looked like they've been there since world war 2. Anyway, I could go on forever. In frankness, I didn't find this a revolting experience (I didn't see cockroaches or filth, for example) but it's certainly below average.

In three visits, we have never had any trouble with check-in or cleanliness of the room. Sometimes the staff has been more friendly than others, but never inattentive. This is NOT a luxury hotel. Views from the windows consist mainly of rooftops and urban landscape, and the elevator is small and a bit creepy, which has inspired us to get a bit more exercise on the stairs. But the hotel is located in a safe neighborhood with a small shopping center right across the street which has proven helpful for a few groceries and sundries as needs have arisen. It might be worth mentioning that while breakfast is included, this does NOT imply the full English breakfast, but instead, a very limited offering of cereal and toast. You can upgrade, for a price, but you might do better to make your way across the street to Garfunkel's. (I'm a bit partial to the waffles with fruit topping!)

This small, charming hotel is located within easy walking distance from the Gloucester Road Underground Station with small restaurants, shops and several major museums nearby. Thus we had easy access to public transit for travel about the city as well as places to visit on foot such as the Victoria and Albert Museum, Science Museum and Museum of Natural History. Our rooms were aesthetically attractive with up to date conveniences including internet access, flat screen TV with movie/music choices, small fridge, safe box , air conditioning and adequate closet and storage spaces.

There is also a small lounge and bar just off the hotel foyer, with a friendly and wonderfully funny bar keep. Though the hotel was almost fully booked when we walked through their doors, the staff went out of their way to find us rooms for that first evening and then, to enable us to depart for our scheduled activities early the next day, moved our luggage to different rooms for the remainder of our stay. The kindness and generosity of the staff cannot be elaborated on enough, from how the day clerk we first met responded to our situation with sympathy while making our stay possible, to the night clerk whom we came to consider as a wonderful new friend. He answered many questions, helping us learn about the city and use the public transit system with ease. At the end of our stay he even carried our bags to the Underground platform we needed for our return trip to Heathrow. If a giant establishment with swimming pools and grand ball rooms is what you want then look elsewhere.

However (big customer service plus points for this), within a couple of minutes reception rang up to the room to say that the tea tray was on it's way up ... 30 seconds later, the tray arrived. The room was fairly recently redecorated and spotlessly clean, with plenty of wardrobe space and a fridge and big flatscreen tv too. Be prepared for the size of the bathrooms as they can only be described as bijou. But this again was spotlessly clean and the shower worked well (there's only a small bar of soap/person provided so make sure you bring your own shampoo/conditioner/shower gel). We had a room at the back of the hotel, which was great because it was nice and quiet and no road noise to contend with. The hotel also has an Indian Restaurant attached which we ate at and whilst the menu is fairly standard fare, the prices are reasonable, the service was attentive, food tasty and portion sizes good. Continental breakfast was included, which previous reviews have rated as meagre. Continental breakfast is exactly what you get: cereal, toast, juice and tea/coffee/hot chocolate. This was more than enough to get us on our way and when my mom snaffled the last sachet of marmalade, my sighs of disappointment were overheard and two more sachets were delivered to the table ... good service!! If you're looking for a good value hotel in a handy central london location for up to 3 nights stay, I would certainly recommend.

I did not wait once to get into the shower and found the hotel overall to be very clean. My sheets were crisp, white and clean and the sink was always scrubbed and shining. My twin bed was brand new. While it was definitely a bit of a pain and inconvenience to walk down the hall to the bathroom, and I did have to go through a door and down some steps, the price made it worth it. With the current exchange rate and prices in London, this was the only great deal I got during my trip. The help was friendly and accommodating. Some of these reviews complain about the white toast for breakfast but, hey, it was included in my low rate, was delivered hot and quickly. After the second day there, the staff remembered that I take coffee, not tea and always greeted me with a smile and a pleasant attitude. The only complaint I would have is that the hotel is undergoing a remodel. The hallways were full of carpentry supplies and they were trying out different types of stain on the woodwork, etc. The carpet in my room was ripped. But, again, for the price it was an excellent deal. I felt safe and everything was very clean - I also felt that the staff truly cared that I was enjoying my stay. The hotel is right across the street from the Gloucester tube station which has a direct route to Heathrow.

I stayed at the Montana with my husband for 4 weeks in Oct 2005, and we enjoyed it so much we are staying there again later this year. We booked over the internet after a really long search for a decent hotel at a decent price in a good local in London. Although I had read good reveiws about the hotel I wasn't holding my breath, after all seeing is beleiving. Well we weren't dissapointed and in fact were pleasantly surprised. The reception/bar and dining room were all spotlessly clean. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The continental brekky of toast ( 2 slices each), jam/marmalade, coffee/tea & OJ was enough for us even though it doesn't sound like alot. If you prefer you can order more substantial food for an extra cost but in 4 weeks we didn't bother. toast and coffee is about all we have at home anyway and if you get sick of the spreads BYO. Our room was great, much bigger than we expected. We had room 411 with a double and single bed, small dining table, a nice wardrobe with in room safe and dressing table. There was no tea/coffee facilities in the room which was a shame. The beds were comfy and the linen clean. The bathroom wasn't huge but was roomy enough for my 6ft 2 husband to use without complaining. There was a shower over the bath, toilet and basin with a nice big mirror hiding a nice big cabinet above the basin. The hot water was always hot but the pressure could've been a bit better. We had clean towels and the beds were made every day and the room was really quiet, we had a window that opened onto a quiet mews type area. Yes the lift is small but so what, your only in it a few minutes and if you can't wait for the next one there is always the stairs to keep you healthy. The morning we checked in, we arrived really early (6am) and our room wasn't ready till much later (our fault not theirs). We were invited to leave our bags and relax in the bar/sitting area until the dining room opened when we could have brekky. Well we left our bags and headed out to explore the immediate area in the quite of early morning, it was terrific. ok nothing was open but it was london just waking up so it was pretty special and Hyde Park was wonderful. The only suggestion I would make to improve the hotel is to find a secure area for people to leave their luggage. It was in a corner of the bar/sitting area not visible to the reception staff but easily accessible to anybody else. The dining room that serves brekky in the morning turns into an Indian rest for lunch and dinner and we had dinner there one night and found the food was delicious if a bit pricey but then I've found all indian food is pricey (must be all those expensive spices) and it was pretty comparable to other rests nearby. The Montana's location is just great, walking distance to Harrods, Kensington Palace, Hyde Park, and the V&A and Natural History Museums as well as High St Kensington and Earls Court. Across the road is a post office, Gloucester Rd tube, a bureau de change (or equal). Next to the tube is a small shopping centre with a few restaurants, a Boots chemist, and a Waitrose supermarket. There are lots of other cafe's near by as well as a starbucks. Our highlights were the steak rest and a small itlaian place almost across the road. I think the steak rest was called Blue Fire or something Fire. Also within walking distance was another supermaket Tesco's and a couple of laundymats. We hit the supermarkets every day to buy our lunch of ready made sandwiches or salad or fruit. We found this a much cheaper option than cafes or other sandwich sellars. The sangers were always fresh and had a really wide range of fillings available. For dinner if we couldn't be bothered eating out we'd go to waitrose and head to the deli counter at the back of the store. Next to the deli they had a hot food section where you buy the normal BBQ chicken but also cooked ham hocks, roast duck etc. but just a litlle further along was the counter that sold a huge range cooked ready to eat indian foods. snacks like samosa's & Kebabs, at least 2 types of curry and rice, if it wasn't already hot they would heat it for you. Buy yrself a couple of plastic plates and knifes forks etc and bob's your uncle, your all set.

Overall our stay was ok. There were 3 of us sharing a triple room, which consisted of 3 single beds. However, although I'd requested a room on the 1st or 2nd floor, our room was located in the basement. It looked out onto a tiny (6ft x 6ft) courtyard with a storage room for chemicals which the staff would access several times during the morning/evening. So there was no view and we could only barely see the sky. I had also requested a non-smoking room but there was an ashtray in the room and cigarette burns on the net curtains and bedspreads. The carpets were stained. While the toilet, basin and bath were clean there were significant dampness stains on the bathroom ceiling. There was a very stale smell when we entered the room which prompted one of my fellow travellers to buy some air freshener to use in the room. However due to the courtyard outside we kept the window closed during the day to prevent anyone accessing the room. The hotel has an Indian restaurant so at 9:30 every night the smell of food from the kitchen would waft into the room so again we had to close the window. Therefore the room was incredibly warm; daytime temperatures were in the mid 20s Celsius and it was difficult to sleep due to the heat. The television was very small and had no teletext but range of channels was ok. The elevator is tiny as per previous reviews. It took 3 of us (squashed) or only 2 of us with bags. We had to ask for a kettle and it arrived while we were out of the room so it only included 2 cups. So I asked for a third cup which came relatively quickly. Tea, coffee, sugar and UHT milk were provided. However on another occassion we asked if there was a scissors we could borrow but there was none available in reception and there wasn't really any effort made to find one for us. Our reservation included continental breakfast. At breakfast we were shown to a table, and served orange juice (which I liked but might be weak for some tastes). We were then given a choice of tea or coffee and 2 slices of white toast each. The toast was perfectly cooked and always arrived hot. The service was polite and very prompt, and the server remembered our choices of tea/coffee on the second day. However, I was expecting cereal but it transpired that this would have cost an extra \u00a31.50 per person. The room was cleaned daily and we were given 3 fresh towels and soap. However one point to note is that on Saturday the maid was already cleaning our room when we returned from breakfast at around 8.30. Our room (570) was adjacent to the bathroom of the adjoining room. We could hear our neighbour singing in the shower and also the flush of the toilet. On checking-out we were allowed to leave our luggage but it was in an area just outside the reception desk so I must admit being a bit concerned about how easy it would have been for someone to run off with it. However it was all fine when we came to collect it. I would only recommend this hotel if you are on a semi-restricted budget and are not too fussy about luxuries. Next time I would prefer to pay more and have a higher standard room. In summary, good points: 1) Location of the hotel - literally cross the street for the tube station, some caf\u00e9s/restaurants/fast food outlets and some small supermarkets 2) We arrived at 11:30 approx and were allowed to check in early. 3) Juice, tea and toast at breakfast Bad points: 1) Location of the room in the basement 2) Overall condition of the room 3) The heat especially at night and having to keep the window closed meant very little fresh air 4) Smells from the kitchen", "Date": "September 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cWe Cancelled Reservation for End of Trip & Stayed Elsewhere\u201d", "Author": "sylvanandmilton", "ReviewID": "UR5530771", "Content": "The Hotel Montana was half a block from the Gloucester tube station.

Although it isn't a luxurious hotel, it is fine for coming back to after a day of being out in the city. I returned to london in May and June of 2006 and booked 2 weeks at the Montana again. I am a student and I have found that the Montana hotel is the most affordable place in London besides hostels (which are usually very dirty and overcrowded in London). I called the hotel directly to book my reservation and they gave me a single room with a bathroom down the hall for 35 pounds a night, with the 7th night free. This is a very good deal for london, considering that breakfast is included too. The breakfast of toast and coffee or tea does get old very quickly though. I wish they would add some cold cereals or muffins or something else to the menu as well. The rooms can be a bit noisy if you are on the side that looks over gloucester road or cromwell road. I only found the noise to be a problem my first night there, after that I adjusted to it. Each room is cleaned well and is supplied with a towel and a bar of soap. Bring your own washcloth and shampoo because they do not supply them. I personally think that the staff at the hotel are very friendly and accomodating. I became very ill on the day I was supposed to fly to London and I had to change my flight to a few days later. This meant I would not be able to check into the Montana when I was supposed to in less than 24 hours. They usually require 48 hours notice for cancelling but they let me change my reservations with less than 24 hours notice at no charge. I booked a week at the Montana in June as well and at first they did not have any single rooms available so I would have had to pay a higher price. But when I arrived at the hotel I found that they had done some rearranging and they managed to get me into the cheaper single room. A lot of people on here seem to complain about the lack of space in the rooms but i found my room to be very spacious even though in America it would be smaller than some people's walk in closets. I don't know what people need all the space for. The rooms definitely provide enough space for luggage, a sink, a bed, dresser, and a tv. They all have windows too, which surprisingly not every hotel room in London has. So overall I find the Montana a very good deal and I recommend it for the budget traveller who will only be there to sleep or watch tv.

This hotel was the least expensive hotel offered in a package deal with the tour company we went with. I wasn't expecting much from the hotel, but all we wanted was a decent place to stay in, which it was. The hotel is in a nice location...it was very convenient and felt safe. Gloucester tube station is just across the street from the hotel, and you can catch the Piccadilly line, the Circle line, and the District line from this tube station. The hotel is right on the corner of Cromwell and Gloucester, very close to a Barclay's bank, an internet cafe, currency exchange, a 24 hour Tesco, a nice little restaurant, a pub, Starbuck's, KFC, and more. The hotel lobby is just as it is on their website pictures. Their lift (elevator) can fit two people comfortably, and four people tightly...not ideal to use if you're closter-phobic. Didn't make use of their bar in the hotel, so can't really comment on it. We had \"continental breakfast\" included with our stay...and as mentioned in previous reviews, it's just a lot of toast, jam, butter, orange juice, coffee, and tea...this breakfast was perfect for me because I don't usually eat a heavy breakfast, so it was just fine. The dining area was clean and no problems with the service there. We must have had the smallest twin/double room in the hotel because it was very narrow (I posted pics with this review). But it had what we needed: twin beds, a good size wardrobe, a tv that worked with a few channels (don't think there was satellite though), a dresser, a large window, a chair, hairdryer, and a private full bathroom (which seemed more spacious than the rest of the room). We checked in at 11am and our room wasn't ready yet. It still had to be cleaned but they gave us the key (card) to the room so that we can leave our luggage in there if we wanted to go out into the city. The cleaning lady was working on our floor (the 3rd floor) when we got to the room and told us that it would be another hour or two before the room was ready since the earliest check in and latest check out times are about the same...this didn't really bother us because we had to catch a train to Manchester soon anyway. When we got back from Manchester, our room was cleaned and were each given clean a towel and a small bar of soap. Our room was cleaned everyday and we were given new towels and soap everyday, plus sheets were changed daily. Our bathroom was clean enough (could have been cleaner to my high standards, but was ok), and there was plenty of hot water. A particular person at the front desk sometimes could have been a bit nicer, but it didn't kill our stay at the hotel or anything. Our room was at the corner of the hotel, where Glocester and Cromwell meet, but the street noise didn't bother us...get earplugs for sleeping if you're concerned and it will do just fine. We had no disruptions when sleeping; the hotel was quiet. The smell of the room wasn't as fresh as I was hoping for because I'm a non-smoker and I was sure that the people who stayed in our room just prior to us did smoke in the room. But when our room was cleaned, they left the window a bit ajar to air it out daily. I probably wouldn't want to stay at this hotel in the summer because it doesn't have air conditioning, but in April it was just fine. The hotel is not a modern property, it's an older property...so expect to see an older property and don't expect a spacious north-american-style room. I'd classify this hotel as a 2 and a half star. There's nothing fancy about this hotel, but it has the basics and is clean. A bit more luxury and higher room standard would have been nice (which is what I will go for elsewhere on my next visit to London), but for the budget price we paid and since we were out and about in the city and other parts of England all day everyday, the hotel did the job...was able to sleep, keep our clothes and belongings there safely, and took hot showers.

Great rates available on Hotel-assist.", "Date": "November 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood Little Hotel, Great Location!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2837952", "Content": "We stayed at the Montana Hotel on 17 November. We needed a cheap hotel for our last night in London and we liked the Gloucester Road area. They quoted us a price of 75 pounds and my husband bargained the rate down to 65 pounds. Our room was larger than I expected for a budget hotel. It had a double bed and also a twin bed. The down side was the bathroom was the size of a closet but it was clean and there was plenty of hot water. Also, the bed was extremely hard but it was okay for one night. Breakfast was included in the rate. The free breakfast consisted of coffee, tea or juice and toast. Anything else was extra but the free breakfast was adequate. Would probably stay there again if nothing else was available mainly because I liked the area.", "Date": "November 21, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Montana Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d254585-Reviews-Montana_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$103 - $435*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">67-69 Gloucester Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">SW7 4PG</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "254585", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/cc/6b/cc6bed398c9458352da0592be606462c6large.jpg"}}
