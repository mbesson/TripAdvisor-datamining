Overall it is not bad but it does not meet standards of an excellent hotel. Yes it is clean. Rooms were average but the lobby was substandard, no comfortable chairs or meeting place. Our tv never worked properly it had to be plugged and unplugged multiple times for it to work. The bathroom is odd, no privacy windows looking in the bathroom (maybe trying mimic the Redlight). The breakfast was average, had to ask 2 days for the fruit bowl to be filled. One of the coffee machines has scotch tape holding together. Not a big deal but not what one expects for the price. Whe we arrived we were informed we were upgraded, thank you, the when I asked for basic toiletries I was told they do not provide toiletries to \"standard rooms\"??? Were we upgraded from a substandard room. Staff was hit and miss, some very helpful others with no interest or clue what a tourist would need. One other complaint was when I made my reservation, I was told no parking available with hotel. On arrival I asked for recommendations for parking the clerk looked up and said their parking was filled until the day before we left and since I did not make any reservations no space for us.

As two females travelling alone we were very wary of being conned out of our money. On arrival we went to the desk. The woman behind the desk asked us to pay a 300 Euro deposit immediately which was not on the booking confirmation at all (incase we used any hotel ameneties). Of course being asked to pay 300 Euros cash, I immediately refused. After a short argument with the woman behind the desk, I was then asked if I had a debit card - which I would have thought they would have suggested in the first place when we said it would be most of our spending money gone and there was no point getting it back the day we were leaving. Eventually after being told we may have to leave this hotel if we refused to pay up, they accepted a credit card details as security incase we did spend anything. Beware of this, the member of staff was very insistent on the cash! After this long debate which went on for at least ten minutes, where I offered to speak to the manager myself, we had to wait for our luggage to be put into the luggage room. We were waiting where we were asked to, when a woman with a breakfast trolley dashed through carelessly, running over my bags and coat which had been waiting on the floor for at least 5 minutes. Aside from our initial ordeal, the hotel was bizarrely but very modernly decorated. The room was spacious and there was plenty of room for both mine and my friend's cases on the floor. The bathroom was clean, the shower was excellent. The only strange thing was that there was a window looking into the bathroom - a bit strange! My advice would be not to stay here with a business colleague! The hotel also had good tea and coffee facilities, lifts to all floors and easy transport access into Amsterdam. It was a nice quiet place to stay. I would recommend the hotel however I was disappointed at the attitude of the staff initially who told me that all European hotels take a deposit in cash only, which was not true as I know because I have stayed in quite a few places!! Overall, the hotel was good. I don't know if the way we were treated was anything to do with being young and looking fairly vulnerable but I think the welcome was not a reflection on the hotel rooms at all.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery clean and comfortable + more!\u201d", "Author": "Dianne H", "ReviewID": "UR125152719", "Content": "Stayed at the Eden Manor, 3 nights in Feb 2012.

On arrival check in staff were friendly and the porter give us the history of the hotel on the way to our room and was very pleasant.The room was bright and spacious however house keeping provided a very poor service. The floor was carpeted and not hoovered the entire duration of our stay and with a 4 year old it got quite messy and given he has asthma it was not good. We left towels in the shower for changing and found them hanging on the towel rail on return to the room that day, they were stained which was how we knew they were the same towels. None of the work tops were cleaned down and had ring stains from glasses and soap that dripped from the dispenser also stayed the duration and was not cleaned. While I apprecciate we stayed over Christmas and the hotel was not at full capacity and a better standard should have been provided. We also ordered breakfast from room service on Christmas morning as a treat and at 45 euros for two persons had high expectations and were very disappointed, the cooked breakfast was cold and the promise of danish pastries and bread with butter and preserves turned out to be some bread and 2 stale crossants minus butter or preserves, when we phoned reception to request them we were told it would be sent but nothing arrived. Definately not value for money and no reduction was offered on complaint. The tray was still in the room when we returned later that day so we sat it in the hallway and on retrun to the hotel that night after a show found it was still sitting there and a fly buzzing around it, very unimpressed. We drank in the bar twice during our stay and found we had to wait long periods of time for service as the barmen kept wandering off into the restuarant or down the hallway and you'd have to go looking for them and shout across to the restuarant which again was poor service. On check out we found a very rude and unhelpful receptionist who never once asked if everything was ok or if we enjoyed our stay and when we asked for somewhere to store our bags we were met with a glare that would turn milk sour.

On our return we were given our key and told that they'd send the bags up. So far so good. However, when we arrived at the room it wasn't the room we had booked. I had specifically checked their rooms before making the booking and had paid extra for a room with a bath rather than just a shower, a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153king size bed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and a view of the garden. The room we had been given had no bath, two single beds pushed together rather than a kingsize bed and no garden view. So I popped down to reception to see if a mistake had been made, the receptionist spoke to the manager and came back and told me that it was the room I had booked and that nothing could be done. So I went back to my room, checked my email on my iPad to ensure that I hadn't made a mistake, and checked the description of the room I had booked on their website, and back to reception I went and showed them their website, the room description and asked for the situation to be resolved. I was again told that there was nothing they could do, and that they had no rooms with kingsize beds at all and that the website was in error. I was very unhappy about this and went back to the room to inform my fianc\u00c3\u00a9e who was disappointed as this wasn't the romantic break that we had planned. I then reception called us and apologised for the situation, and I told them that it wasn't good enough, and that I hadn't got the room I'd paid for. The receptionist was very apologetic but insisted that the rooms that we had booked didn't exist. She then called back AGAIN stating that she had spoken to the manager and there were two rooms available that she would like us to look at, she came and collected us from the room and the first room she showed us was EXACTLY as the description had been on the website, a Kingsize bed that she had previously insisted they didn't have, a bath that she had previously said they had no rooms available with and a garden view. We didn't see the second room on offer as that was exactly what I had paid for and what I had wanted, but it took the best part of 2 hours to sort out and some stress and upset on our half that was unnecessary if they had given us the correct room in the first place. The rest of the stay was uneventful, other than the maid service not replenishing the coffee/tea one day we were perfectly happy, the bath was lovely and large and fit two people easily, the bed was clean and comfy and the rest of the room was modern stylish and well fitted. The restaurant was pleasant too and I wish I could remember the name of the lady who served us who was very jolly and pleasant in there and made the meal memorable. I would stay at the Eden Manor again, but I would warn all people planning to stay there to make sure they get the room they pay for if they book a Deluxe room, as they seem to try to palm people off into the cheaper \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Superior\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms. You shouldn't have to complain so much so many times and be lied to when paying extra for a room, and I travel frequently and this is the first \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Eden\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel I've stayed in and gave me the worst first impression I've ever experienced in a hotel. Over all its an nice location, most of the staff were very pleasant, the waitress in the restaurant and the concierge in particular deserve a mention.

This room I believe is classed as a suite and has its own patio area with table & chairs. The bathroom facilities were excellent 5*. The Hotel uses a selection of 'Rituals' products in the bathroom which are similar to 'Molton Brown'. Bathroom has a 7 feet wide window which looks in to the bedroom. When lying back in the bath you can watch one of the 2 TV's! At the end of the bed is a TV unit with a TV on either side. Very nice linen and pillows and the bed is also very large 6 footer! There is a fridge in the room which is very hand if you wish to stock it with products from the Supermarket across the street! The staff were very friendly towards children and always made us feel very welcome. The Kids menu has a choice of 3 starters - 3 mains & 3 deserts. My son particularly liked the Chicken Sausuage & chips with Apple sauce! I had a very nice Pizza and the remainder of the other food looked really nice. You may be thinking that the Hotel is a little out of the way! Far from it! To be fair I have stayed in the Krasnapolsky on Dam Square and felt a little uneasy as the Red Light district begins at the street along side. It is incredibly easy to get to the Hotel from the Airport! We had 15.50 Euro 72 Hour Transport tickets. (same price for kids!). Plus you have to buy a separate train ticket now to get to Central station. From the Airport the journey to the hotel is 50 minutes. Straight out of arrivals down the escaltor to the Station. Take train to Central Station, get a No. 9 Tram heading to Diemen Sniep! In about 20 minutes you are 150 yards from the Hotel door! Brilliant and easy! All you do is take the No. 9 from outside the Hotel again which this time is heading back to Central Station and get off in Dam Square! The Eden Manor is 200 yards from Oosterpark which is massive! Has a nice path all the way around, a Childrens play area and a massive paddling pool. We played frisbee there one evening and the park was full of locals chilling out and playing volleyball and having barbecues (felt a really nice atmosphere!). Regardless of whether you are staying with kids or not, the Artis Zoo is incredible!! Will take you 3hours plus to do it justice! Nice to spend the whole day there. The localls appeared to be using coupons for a discount at the gate. I suggest you try the website. If yiou have kids under 5, there are seated karts with long handles for you to drag the round in. They cost 2 Euro and save little legs! The zoo is only 4-5 Tram stops on the No.9 also. All stops are called out verbally on the Trams!", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201chousekeeping let it down\u201d", "Author": "Lesleyc1703", "ReviewID": "UR116355380", "Content": "The Hotel had only been opened for 6 weeks yet we had a bulb out in the bathroom and no plug in the sink.

After a 5 day stay we still had no plug for the sink!

If you're looking to be bang in the middle of the sights though this probably isn't the hotel for you. Only criticism was the over-priced breakfast... at 17.50 euros each for a buffet style breakfast I think this is a bit excessive. For this reason we only had the breakfast in the hotel on one of the two mornings we were there - had the price been more reasonable we would have had breakfast there both mornings.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced and poor management\u201d", "Author": "oegstgeest", "ReviewID": "UR115696878", "Content": "We booked our rooms online, expecting very high standards for this new hotel outside the city centre (and therefore supposed to be of better quality than those in the tourist area).

The concierge was really helpful he asked us if we need any advise for sightseeing, maps, etc. The rooms were really nice and clean, shower was in the style of a wet room. I booked breakfast at the time of booking this room, most sites showed room only but we booked in advance, the cost locally was 17.50 euro which to be honest was a little much and would not have had breakfast in the hotel if I had not pre paid it. Breakfast was Eggs, bacon, sausage and the the usual continental.

The hotel has decided to be green, and not installed airconditioning, instead there is an air circulation system which is meant to cool the room. You might not imagine that this would be a problem, and perhaps we were just unlucky, but staying on the top floor in the summer the heat was unbearable during the night, especially as the circulation unit switched itself off every hour, and having the windows open wasn't really possible due to the noise from the street outside.

We stayed at the hotel as part of a group and had arrived early,(the rest of the group joined later from London) We had informed the very friendly gentleman at the front desk that we are part of a tour group and he still insisted that we pay a booking fee! (still cannot explain why this was asked) One of the rooms was not ready (family room) and he gladly accommodated us by offering to store the luggage while we go site seeing. When the tour director called she inquired whether we had arrived and was informed by the front desk staff that we are yet to check in!!!!! ( we had already arrived early morning and was site seeing in Amsterdam) When the tour director arrived and found us waiting she asked the lady at the front desk and her response was quite simple, that she only started work the afternoon and was unaware that we had checked in! SHOCKING! Eventually when we arrived back to the hotel from our group excursion, the room that was originally allocated to my sister and her family was given to someone else and she was not given a family room! When the tour director again approached the front desk he in amazement said that it was a triple room with an additional bed. He didn't believe my brother in law that it was not a triple room (as if we don't know the difference) and then called up to the room and asked if there was a third bed! Only upon hearing this from my sister in the room did he act upon this and asked one of the porters to bring a bed up to their room!! AGAIN Shocking service to say the least. The breakfast was average with very unfriendly staff! Location good as the tram stop is just opposite the hotel.

As the hotel is relatively new (I think it opened around the 10th of June 2011) there weren't many reviews on sites such as this one, but I kept an open mind and was most pleasantly surprised. The hotel isn't far from the centre, don't be put off by the fact it isn't on Dam Square (the main city square). Hotels in close proximity of Dam Square tend to be overpriced, or of poor quality with a few exceptions of course. Transportation wise, I'd recommend getting a 24/48/72 (whichever suits) hour card for unlimited travel with GVB (the company that runs the trams, metro and bus services in the city) which can be obtained relatively cheaply and there's a tram stop right outside the hotel. Travel time from Central Station to the hotel is about 10 minutes by tram, or a 30 minute walk. As you would expect the hotel is very clean (unused) and modern. There are two reception desks to check-in at. There's also a (very!) keen concierge readily available. The rooms are well-sized with everything you could ask for. The bed is amazing, and I had the best nights sleep I've ever had in a hotel. Behind the bed is a LARGE canvas-type piece of artwork which I think vary from room to room. In our room, 116, was a shot of a beautiful fashion model - it was a great focal point of the room. The bathrooms are spacious - our room didn't have a bath however - and the plumbing all work seamlessly. It seemed to never have been used, or maybe they just have very high cleaning standards. Either way, I was impressed. Love the hotel, and can't wait to go back!
