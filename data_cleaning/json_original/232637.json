{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Motor Show 2007 My partner and I have just returned from the Amadeus Hotel after staying there for three nights to visit the Motor Show. The hotel was excellent as were the staff and facilities. The food in the restaurant was very good and the breakfast would please even the fussiest person!It was very convenient for the underground train to Frankfurt town and for the Motor Show. The Hessen Centre had a lots of shops and cafes/fast food shops. On the Sunday there was a very big antique market.There is not a lot to do in the area but as Frankfurt is only approx 10 mins away it is not a problem.We would definately recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "Sep 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR766826372", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Sandiet"}, {"Content": "Pretty good for where it was! Stayed here 1/12-1/15/04. On a business trip in Frankfurt, we were put in this hotel. Smaller rooms than in the U.S. Not much on special ammenities, but the staff is extremely hospitable and the restaurant is great for all meals. As for location, don't expect much...not really near anything except a mall...Hessen Centre. It was a nice stay, nothing to write home about. Bring your OWN shampoo and soap. The showers have a squeeze bottle of soap on the wall for your hair and body. Enjoy.", "Date": "Jan 19, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR800206834", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Preis Leistung stimmt nicht, kein sympatisches Flair.
