Location of the hotel is excellent, with a S-ban station literally around the corner. The area which the hotel is located is surrounded by plenty of bars and restaurants which resulted in us never having to travel into the centre at night. The choice for breakfast outside the hotel is also very good, with a special mention for the Schwarzes Cafe a block away on Kantstrasse. The hotel itself has gone for a very modern feel as previous reviewers have commented. With such a design there is a risk that the hotel could look a bit tacky and cheap. However in my opinion it has been decorated very well, especially the lobby/bar area as you enter the hotel. We went for a superior room when we booked which gave us a slightly larger room and a view over the courtyard. The bathroom we had was a separate room and very spacious inside. The bedroom itself was of the small to medium size with a comfortable bed. Free minibar in the room was a nice touch which offered a good selection of soft drinks. My only negative point would be that our items were not replenished during our stay. Although it is understandable with the minibar, it also extended to the coffee and the bathroom items. However, overall it is a lovely hotel in a great location of the city which we would consider staying in again when we return to Berlin.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "billmayhols", "ReviewID": "UR126554999", "Content": "An ultra modern hotel with with all a group of six weekenders needed.

The rooms are very well sound-proofed compared to other, more expensive, hotels I have stayed in. We spent three nights here and slept well every night. We did not speak to the staff very often, but when we did, everyone was friendly and helpful. We also checked in two hours early without any problem. Our room was not the largest, but it was very elegantly designed and had quality fittings.

The really annoying thing is they fail to mention that your bathroom is basically in your room (or your room is your bathroom?) whereby its expected that you pull accross a white curtain when washing yourself. I am not sure of the purpose of the curtain as directly opposite is a massive mirror, so who ever you are with will see you! The toilet had only frosted glass. The shower is really powerful though, bonus! Another thing to consider - we stayed between the 27-30th December 2011 and at night the room was UNBEARABLY hot.

We got to the hotel and were really excited, the hotel looked just as great as it does in the photos. The excitement did not last that long. The receptionist barely said hello to us when we said that we would like to check in. She tapped the computer and then said that we have a problem - the hotel is overbooked! We were stunned because we had made a prepayment (the hotel required it) via Hotels.com. There were no apology for the situation. We arrived to the hotel in the morning, which just means that they had systematically overbooked the hotel. The receptionist then said that they have a sister hotel (hotel excelsior) nearby, which according to her was similar to Sir F.K. Savigny. With no options left they ordered a taxi to take us to Excelsior. When we arrived to Excelsior that this hotel really wasn't similar to Sir F.K. Savigny...it had over 300 rooms compared to 45 rooms at Sir F.K. So now we got a large chain hotel instead of a boutique designer hotel...we were not happy. The receptionist gave us the first room which was supposed the same kind of room that we had at Sir F.K....the room was small, had stains on the wall, etc. We returned to the reception and said that we want to speak again with the hotel manager at Sir F.K. We got hold of the manager and this time he was apologizing for the situation at Sir F.K. But the said that there were simply no rooms left \u2013 then he continued that he will make our stay special at Excelsior, he will make sure of that. So after complaining about the first room, we got the supposedly the best room available at Excelsior. It was a regular room on our standards and really not that stylish as the ones in Sir F.K. We were too tired to argue against them anymore and we took the room. Excelsior said that breakfast would be free of charge and that we would get a some sort of gift/fruit basket as an apology from Sir F.K. At the end of the day, we never got any kind of formal apology from Sir F.K., no fruit basket, no nothing (even though we reminded the staff twice!!). We also complained about the broken TV at our room the first night we were there\u2026they said that the technician would fix it the next day\u2026nobody did not do a thing about it! All in all, we were really unsatisfied of the way were treated. So be aware when booking a room from Sir F.K. Savigny.

The place is reasonably new and very neatly done. No real reception desk, just a simple PC on a wooden block. Kept in black and white as well as wood the place has a very distinct flair. My room was a little small but comfortable. Shortly after checking in the lady from the front called and asked if I wanted a bigger room that had just become available. I stayed in the small one as it was fine for me. Comfy bed, rain shower head, good TV and some free soft drinks in the room. There is a small courtyard with some grass and chairs which is pretty relaxing. So the place itself is pretty neat, but what really makes it is the staff. Every single staff I encountered was super friendly and helpful and not the over top type friendly. Just plain friendly and helpful. Need phone charger; no problem, shirt ironed quickly; pleasure, some breakfast at 2pm; sure. Not that I wanted it, but lack of parking and spa make this a very good and not an excellent.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bonn, Germany", "Title": "\u201curban, stylish, individual\u201d", "Author": "janmartinK", "ReviewID": "UR108001519", "Content": "Lots of hotels try to be cool nowadays but this one succeeds effortlessly in its own way. The hotel occupies a narrow building which has been converted with ingenuity and lots of style. Black and white is the signature theme with a set of black-and white photographs being repeated in various places as picture, carpet, elevator ceiling, wallpaper etc. Each room appears to be different (o.k. i've only seen one but one can guess from the layout). My room was a bit small (like most of the other spaces) but very comfortable. In the breakfast room you sit like in a caf\u00e9, with a view of passing people on the street. There's also a little garden in the back. The staff were unobtrusively helpful and friendly, they seemed just the right people for this hotel. I loved it here and I can recommend it to anyone looking for a truly unique and metropolitan place to stay. If lots of space and a quiet neighborhood is what you are looking for you might have to go somewhere else, which would be a pity.

All black and white, great lounge area with ample seats, and a nice bar. Drinks are expensive but then you are in West Berlin. The room (standard business) was small but perfectly formed, with a comfortable bed, flat screen tv, little desk, mini bar and coffee and tea facilities. The toilet and shower room are separate, a luxury in Berlin, and practically next to the bed. They are hidden behind opaque glass... you can't see through them but it does feel a bit odd, sitting on a loo that is so near the bed. It all looks pretty and boutiquey though. There is curtain you can close next to the bed, to give a bit more of an idea of separation between bathroom area and sleep area. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel. We had a drink, and asked the bar man for advice on restaurants in the area. He was thorough in his reply, and indeed there are many nice places nearby to choose from. We followed the man's advice and went to nearby Dao restaurant (Thai food) which was very good. There was some noise from the corridor filtering into the room during the night, slamming doors mainly. I think it was more due to our fellow hotel guests than the hotel, though you might conclude that the sound insulation from corridor to room is not the highest quality. It didn't bother me too much. On leaving, we were able to leave our luggage in the luggage room, as you would expect, and when collecting they helped to carry it to the door and offered to call a taxi.
