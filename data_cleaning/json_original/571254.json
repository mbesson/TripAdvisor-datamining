{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Leaking water! We chose this hotel because of its location (downtown and close to the Biscayne Market, parks, AA basketball arena, etc). Boy...it was a BIG MISTAKE! First of all the services at the concierge were terrible. The guy was real rude and a jerk! We end up with a room with leaking water, and the AC was half working and to mention the 1000 year old cigarette smell...and it cost us $75. It was a one night thing for us, so we did not make too much complain because it was late in the night when we checked in and we were exhausted over an entire day of driving. But surely we will never go back if we would ever at that area.", "Date": "Jul 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR928467214", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "traveler_w0rld"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel! This is a great choice if you don't want to spend a lot of money and want to stay close to the beach and all the action Miami has to offer. Our room had two queen size beds, a small bathroom with a bathtub,and a great view overlooking the water. The lobby is huge and nicely decorated. This hotel also has a restaurant which we never went too ( too expensive), and some stores in the hotel. It was overall a good experience.", "Date": "Apr 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR265283968", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jgerund"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34438-d571254-r17980410-Dupont_Plaza_Hotel-Miami_Florida.html", "HotelID": "571254", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
