We travel to San Diego often and decided to try a hotel away from the downtown area. The Sorrento area is just minutes away from downtown San Diego, but is also close to Torrey Pines and La Jolla. We were happy with our choice. The rooms were clean, the staff was nice, and even though our room faced Lusk Street, it was very quiet. Breakfast was the usual Holiday Inn Express fare. The pool was kind of small, but the kids using it seemed to be having lots of fun! My only complaint about our room on the fourth floor was that we couldn't open the window. This necessitated turning on the air conditioning unit, which was noisy. Also, the chair in the \"business area\" needs to be replaced. It's like sitting in a hole! One of our favorite excursions while visiting San Diego was a visit to the wineries in Temecula, which we reached via Highway 78, traveling through the little town of Ramona, famous for avocado and citrus orchards, wine grape production, and the most delicious cinnamon rolls I ever eaten at The Ramona Cafe. If you love visiting gardens, you must see the San Diego Botanical Garden, located in Encinitas. It's a very restful garden with lovely California native plants, magnificent palms, and huge bamboo groves. For the kids there's a large interactive children's garden that's fun for adults too.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redmond, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cWindows Wont Open\u201d", "Author": "longball44", "ReviewID": "UR126649401", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here five days in March 2012. One problem was that, for the first time in our hotel/motel experiences, we could not open a window to get fresh air. Yes having the AC on all the time drowns out any road or freeway noise, but after awhile it would be nice to be able to get some fresh air without having to take the elevator down and run outside. No matter what floor you are on, most hotels have their windows set you can open them, at least, three or four inches. We went next door to Country Inn & Suites By Carlson and found the same thing, top floor windows that wouldn't open at all. Having a Chili's restaurant directly across from the hotel was a plus for us. We were able to order online and, within minutes, walk over a pick up our dinner at the Chili's To Go door. During the week there was very few folks at breakfast, but come the weekend there were so many people and families having eating that they there was no tables available and they kept running out of food. Even though there were signs that said \"Trays Available\" the staff told me \"No, there are no trays.\" We thought, if there were trays you could, at least, snag some breakfast and take it back up to your room. Not the case here. Hotel doors are heavy and will slam shut if you let them. Please think about the other guests and make sure your door closes quietly when you enter or exit.

You have to be a contortionist to be able to reach the toilet paper behind you when you are done. To make it worse, there is this stupid cosmetic metal shield that hangs over the roll which is supposed to look nice. The only problem is that it rips every single sheet of toilet paper one at a time because the toilet paper is thin... So by the time I am done going, my wrist, back and neck all hurt from trying to reach around and tear off one sheet at a time. Seriously, I am surprised that guests haven't tried to rip the thing off. I tried to put it behind the roll, but it didn't work. What's funny is that I asked other people at breakfast, and they all agreed and said the same thing. I just don't think anyone has thought to mention it before.

This is a great place to stay, especially if you are on a budget. It's in a very nice business/residential area. The decor is simple but modern. The comforters are very soft & white. The staff is very friendly. This is a new, small, simple nice hotel so don't expect lots of amenities like a big large pool etc. There is a small pool though.

We did not use the pull-out sofa, as there were only two of us. However, we were on the first floor at the end of the hall, and the staff seemed to like leaving the emergency side door open, so we had 8-legged bug problems for the 3 days we were there. The continental breakfast was poor, but you get what you pay for. The second day, as we left the cleaning crew came and forgot to leave us ANY towels. When, at 10pm we got back to the room and realized this, no one would answer the front desk, so I had to re-dress the kids and walk up there. I was disappointed to find the employee not at all surprised of what had happened. I was more disappointed upon check out to not have been asked how my stay was, because I would liked to have addressed the bugs, the towels, and the condition of the continental breakfast on day 2. There were also no comment cards on the counter anywhere. However, we did get quite a deal - $55 per night, so really, what can I expect to get for that? The parking lot is shared with a Chili's restaurant. Because we were gone all day, coming back each night we did not have trouble finding a parking spot, and walked over to Chili's for dinner one night. 15 minutes east down Mira Mesa Blvd is the 15 freeway, with tons of shopping and restaurants.
