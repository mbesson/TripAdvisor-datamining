I would suggest to the hotel not to use the rooms that are close to the elevator as you will be moving people. We knew the hotel was sold out so we didn't bother to ask to be moved.

It is in a large field and there are no other buildings around. The Hilton has a restaurant. The pool and whirpool were great. If you have an early flight this is the best place to stay. As I was catching the 4 am shuttle, the shuttle was bringing in 5 people who have traveled from overseas.", "Date": "August 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cFree laundry room.

The location is good for close proximity to the airport - but there are no restaurants (except for 1 at the adjacent Hilton Garden Inn) that are close and easy to get too.

This hotel is great. I stayed here twice in 4 days on my way in and out of town on the Indy 500 weekend. I arrived late at the airport and called for the shuttle. It didn't take more than 10 minutes for them to arrive. Everything is so new. They gave me a suite on the 4th floor at the very end of the hall. It had a kitchenette and a huge living room and a desk dividing the room. Breakfast was standard for a Hampton. The gym is the best I have ever seen in a Hampton Inn or most other hotels. Before my flight out of town the next day, I stayed here. I was given a typical room with a shower only, no tub. It was really nice and served its purpose. There is absolutely nothing around this place so you would need a car, but for an airport location it is great. I would definitely choose to stay here again if I have a similar travel schedule as I did with this trip.", "Date": "May 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh", "Title": "\u201cpleasant surprise\u201d", "Author": "julzbeth29", "ReviewID": "UR29777117", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Hampton Inn near the Indianapolis airport several months ago. I rarely leave reviews for places, but I was so pleased with my stay..they deserved some credit! It is a new hotel and the hotel facilities are clean, with a nice pool area and workout room. The room was also spacious and clean. We stayed in a room with a King Bed. When we got to our room..it didn't have that \"typical hotel room\" feel to it. It actually was arranged more like a room in my own house! The bathroom was large with a large step in shower. The lights were energy savers and came on automatically. I try to stay in Hampton Inn's whenever I travel because you are usually guarenteed a nice stay. I must say that this is the nicest hotel I've been in for awhile...even nicer than the Hilton's and Marriot's we occasionally stay in when travelling to larger cities. The price of this hotel was $100 cheaper than the older Hampton Inn 10 minutes down the highway. If I had to say a down fall...this hotel is in an area that is not developed yet and there are not much for dining and entertainment in the immediate area.", "Date": "May 11, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hampton Inn & Suites Indianapolis-Airport", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g37209-d1201174-Reviews-Hampton_Inn_Suites_Indianapolis_Airport-Indianapolis_Indiana.html", "Price": "$107 - $174*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">9020 Hatfield Drive</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Indianapolis</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">IN</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">46231</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1201174", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/4c/dc/4cdc84c1c927612887bcf382a1fb0a1d3large.jpg"}}
