It is two minutes from the tube station, and around 20 minutes from El Retiro park. The ladies at reception are very nice, English speaking, they are trying to help as much as they can. The building has a lift. The appartment had a nice and spatious bedroom, with safety box, a bathroom with a big shower, kitchen, and a really large livingroom. In the living, the sofa can be used as a second bed and it is really confortable. Smoking is permitted, the air conditioning works. There is plenty of food in the kitchen for breakfast, and also refill for expresso machine. Single use bath and hygiene items are present and replaced daily. Overall, no comment. I wish I could find such nice accomodation everywhere.", "Date": "July 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGood Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "SPR_11", "ReviewID": "UR118457812", "Content": "We stayed in two different apartments over six nights, and I would stay here again. I liked that it's out of the noisy city center, but still in an interesting neighborhood with shopping and sites nearby. Metro stops on the brown, green and purple lines are a short walk away or you can take longer walks to Retiro Park, the Biblioteca Nacional or the Prado. The staff were friendly enough and able to help out with a bit of English when my spotty Spanish failed me. The housekeeping was average. The apartments and facilities were acceptably clean, but we didn't always have what we needed (i.e., bottle opener). It was nice that each apartment has a stock of continental-breakfast fare that you can eat whenever you want to. Double check the fruit, because it doesn't appear to be changed very frequently and we tore into some too old oranges. The first apartment on the ground floor was spacious, but a bit noisy. The second apartment on the fourth floor had a bedroom, sitting room, kitchen and bathroom. That meant we had more space than your typical European hotel, but each room was small so we sometimes felt a bit cramped. Still, I consider the hotel/apartments a good value and would recommend them to others.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakville, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood value in Salamanca\u201d", "Author": "Drew027", "ReviewID": "UR116724778", "Content": "We enjoyed our 2-night stay at Apartamentos Ramon de la Cruz. The suite was huge with a good sized bedroom, large living room and full kitchen. The Salamanca area is a quiet oasis on the fringe of central Madrid and offers access to a number of metro stations for access to old Madrid. The front desk was helpful and friendly. We'd recommend this hotel if you need space and enjoy a quiet neighbourhood.

It was perfect. It was spacious, clean, and quiet. Cereal, milk, juice, fruit, coffee, tea, hot chocolate and prepackaged bread products were provided daily in our kitchen for breakfast. There was daily clean up service. Front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. There is a grocery store a couple of blocks away on Nunez de Balboa, a panaderia on the way there, and the Mercado de la Paz is just a few blocks beyond that. Plenty of toiletries, but bring your own laundry detergent if you plan on washing clothes (we did).
