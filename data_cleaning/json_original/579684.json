The room was gorgeous, the restaurant was excellent, the staff were friendly and very helpful and the location was ideal. The travel office staff were very helpful in organising a taxi for us to go to the Great Wall, even offering their mobile telephone numbers in case we had difficulties communicating with the taxi driver, how helpful is that? There is a beautiful swimming pool which sadly we did not have time to use, as well as a sauna, spa, 10 pin bowling alley, table tennis and a gym. Everything you could possibly want. All staff we met were very friendly and polite, desperate to help in any way they could. We felt thoroughly spoit the whole time we were there. Great location just 10 minutes walk from a couple of underground stations, taxis on hand the whole time. We couldn't fault this place at all.", "Date": "Oct 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR276104119", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "travelexpress"}, {"Content": "Surprisingly Good Stayed at the Xinhai during the Olympics and was a little wary of a Chinese 4 star but was very pleasantly surprised.The Hotel is a modern well maintained property in a great location, clean and with large well appointed rooms.Jinbao Street is only 10 minutes walk from one of the main shopping streets of Beijing and the underground is less than 5 minutes walk away. In the street are a number of upscale hotels (eg the Regent), restaurants (eg Lei Garden) and car showrooms (Rolls, Ferrari, Maserati) which says something about the area. A new Mall is about to open in the street which will have many of the main upmarket fashion brands.The Hotel itself has some good leisure facilities (a very nice pool, 8 lane bowling alley, table tennis and 4 pool tables) which are reasonably priced and well maintained.The breakfast buffet is excellent.However, there are some annoyances, the lack of English of most staff makes communication difficult when things do not work, the bed is very hard (about as much give as a table) and only CNN and ANX English TV channels.All in all the Xinhai is a very good hotel for a 4 star but is properly classified as that and not a 5 star. Outside of the Olympic period, I am sure it offers great value for money.", "Date": "Aug 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR224685756", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mbgandco"}, {"Content": "Best Valued Hotel in Beijing       Other side of Hotel Room", "Date": "Jul 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR435228625", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "iwannano"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel in Beijing I stayed in the Beijing Xinhai Jinjiang Hotel twice, each time for two nights. It is a ten-minute walk from the north end of Wangfujing, Beijing's pedestrian shopping street. It is about twenty-five minutes from Tiananmen Square, which is off the south end of Wangfujing. It is in a mostly residential area with lots of good little restaurants on the street beside the hotel. The rooms are big and very comfortable. The bathrooms are somewhat lavish. The buffet breakfast is really superb (additional $20 per person per day). The hotel's huge swimming pool is spectacular. The hotel's staff in all departments is gracious, enthusiastically helpful, and very competent.", "Date": "Jun 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR973715584", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "BrooklynClaudius"}, {"Content": "Total Disappointment I had read such rave reviews on Trip Advisor about this hotel that I was really looking forward to staying here during our week long trip to Beijing. The hotel when it was new I'm sure was absolutely beautiful but now the rooms have seen much better days. They look run down and dirty. The bathroom had a massive stand up shower which was great for us but not very good if you value a good soak at the end of the day. They initially had booked us in a room right in front of the elevators so we asked them to change which they did, so that was positive. The hotel is right on the corner of a fairly busy intersection so don't expect to sleep in past 7, that's when the traffic gets busy and the horns get loud. We had issues booking things through the hotel....the concierge do NOT handle that job although some of them make you believe that they do. The hotel has a separate ticket office area where one of the ladies was extremely helpful for us from booking events to writing down destinations in Chinese. Very few of the staff speak fluent English but most of them will at leasty say hello. We had problems with the driver of the private car we hired for a day recommending a place to eat that charged us the foreigner price. We were extremely disappointed in that. We thought that by staying in a higher end hotel we wouldn't run into things like that but it seems that's not the case in Beijing. Always make sure Taxi drivers start their meter and always have the name of your hotel written in their language...even with a map they will say they don't know how to get there. The positive thing about the hotel is that it's within walking distance to the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven and the main Wangfujing shopping district. You can walk to the Yashow market if you're up to it but it's a solid hour walk. I think the main issue I had with this hotel was that it didn't seem to cater to very well to English speaking guests. I would recommend staying at a more global chain like the Hilton, Park Plaza etc. This hotel fell really short of what I was expecting....", "Date": "Apr 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR369446574", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Janesse"}, {"Content": "Great price for a great room We booked one night at the JinJiang Hotel in Beijing, after searching hotels on Trip Advisor. The price seemed out-of-line with the other listings we had reviewed. Thinking that the price was too cheap comparatively we assumed there was some catch. We were very very pleased and shocked to find that not only was the JinJiang Hotel, a good value, at 850 RMB/night...it was a downright steal ! Our room was very new and clean with very stylish decor. The lobby is very lush with marble and crystal everywhere. Although a bit Las Vegas for my personal taste, you can't say it looked anything but expensive. We decided immediately to book additional nights for the remainder of our stay. The restaurant is pleasant, with a nice selection of standard andsome local foods. The price was somewhat expensive, since we did not book a room at a breakfast-included rate. Certainly a small issue to note, when the overall experience was positive. The staff were extremely helpful; struggling with their English, they made every effort to make sure that our needs were attended to.A great great value at the price we paid.", "Date": "Sep 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR754584349", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mah_nyc"}, {"Content": "All it still needs is a trendy, cosy bar.       satisfied in comfy room", "Date": "Aug 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR937274081", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "My-View-on-things"}, {"Content": "A very decent hotel I stayed at this hotel for 7 nights in mid-July 2007. I had planned on staying at the Park Plaza but they were already booked up as I did not make any prior reservations. As per the previous review, I also fly standby. However, we find this hotel to be a really good deal. The room was very spacious and comfortably fit 3 people. The service was excellent and the bathroom were very clean with lots of counter space.. It was about a 15 min walk to Wangfujing from the hotel. The only complaint I have is that management 'shuts down' the air-conditioning around 3am for a few hours. The fan is still running but I did notice a difference especially since it was summer and very, very humid outside.

I had not researched this hotel but the ones I had were not available so we went for it. How lucky for us, a beautiful hotel with great service. We were fortunate enough to have Rachel Wang, the assistant manager, help us set up an overnight trip to Jin Shanling by interpreting for us. I mentioned that date is our anniversary and less than an hour later she came to our room with a fruit basket and flowers with a Happy Anniversary note. Now that's excellent service!!! We also used their travel booking and business service center and all were pleasent experiences. I had read many reviews that stated problems with English not spoken and dirty rooms. None of that existed here. The rooms are beautiful, and the bathrooms are really nice and very clean.
