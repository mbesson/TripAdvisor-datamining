The room was really a small dorm room with 2 bunk beds for 4 people. Although we did not have to share the room with anyone else, it did not seem like a triple. My son had stayed in a much larger triple in Meininger Salzburg and raved about it. We discovered the bedbugs on the last day after three nights and reported the issue to the front desk. The staff seemed unconcerned and had no management on duty to address the issue. They said they would check it out but did not offer us any hope that it would be addressed and offered no compensation. I e-mailed a complaint to Meininger and they did not respond until after I sent it to them again. Meininger's response was simply to apologize. The beds were comfortable, the location was convenient, and the breakfast was good. However, because of the bedbugs and lack of concern by this chain, I do not recommend this place.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "berlin", "Title": "\u201cTHEF PROBLEM IN THE LOBBY AND THE ROOMS\u201d", "Author": "meiningerBerlin", "ReviewID": "UR127982835", "Content": "This Hotel is not really a hotel but almost a Youth Hostel!

My stay there got off to a rocky and indifferent start for two reasons. Firstly when I arrived, I waited 20 minutes in a queue to check-in. One would think for a hotel with 296 rooms, there would be more than 2 persons at the front desk. Secondly, after I got to someone, I was given room 103 on the first floor. My first enquiry was, what about the rooms higher up? I booked in January 2011 for a September 2011 stay and the lady I was dealing with told me that the hotel was fully booked and there were no rooms higher up. The fact alone that she couldn\u2019t look me in the eye and say it hinted to me that she was lying. Nevertheless, I took the key and proceeded to the room. When I got into the room I was in for the shock of my life! Bare in mind, this was a single room I booked. It was literally the smallest hotel room I\u2019ve ever seen in my life! So narrow\u2026.with an even narrower bed. Take a close look at the attached photos. I immediately went back downstairs and spoke to a different person, a guy this time and explained my dissatisfaction to him. In less than five minutes I was given a key for a much larger room on the 8th floor as well as an apology. I really loved the room I had, it had a very new and fresh feeling to it. Flat screen television with several English, French and German channels, telephone, electronic shutters on the window, fully equipped bathroom including hair-dryer etc. All the basics you need. Wi-Fi was available in the room, but this you had to either pay for, or purchase breakfast and get the passcode for free. The views through my window were spectacular. I could clearly see the Reichstag, Deutsche Bank Tower and the river boats on the Spree. The room was also immaculately clean and faultless. Take a look at the attached photos. Breakfast is not included in the room rate but can be purchased separately for \u20ac5.50. I decided not to do this as they were several cafes and other places to get much cheaper breakfast in the Berlin Hauptbanhof next door for a much cheaper price. The breakfast at the hotel is continental and included juice, coffee, tea, cereal, cheese, hams, bread etc. There was also a very space cafeteria-styled eating area as well as a good bar. There are a couple vending machines and also drinks for sale in the reception area, once again, they are much cheaper at the train station next door. The sodas the hotel sells for \u20ac2 can be bought for \u20ac0.99 across the road. On the top floor of the hotel is another bar and balcony area with very stunning views of the station and other areas of the city. My two disappointments with this hotel were that it always seemed like I was waiting 3-4 minutes for an elevator (they are only two) to get to my room. Additionally, there was always a queue at front desk whenever I passed by and the hotel is extremely busy\u2026 lots of human traffic in and out all day. I had to wait ten minutes just to purchase a voucher to use one of the computer terminals in reception. Nonetheless, this is an excellent option for those needing to be close to the Berlin Hauptbanhof or just generally need a good central location. In all probability, I will stay here again on a future trip to Berlin, despite my request for a top floor room being ignored by the first front desk agent I came into contact with. That was really my main downfall with this hotel.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place, Price, Location\u201d", "Author": "atmontejo", "ReviewID": "UR117827776", "Content": "Would recommend this place to anyone.

Overall we absolutely LOVED the experience of staying there. Room: I accidentally booked one twin room with two beds instead of a room with a double bed but that was my fault for misunderstanding the deal... It was fine nevertheless! Upon arrival, our room seemed relatively small. However we got used to it and we realized that due to the fact that there is much storing space so you can get your stuff out of the way, the room is quite comfortable. Needless to say it is very modern and nicely decorated, with a huge window offering a view to the station. Beds: VERY comfortable with super soft and fluffy pillows and covers. Bathroom/WC: small but fully equipped (hand soap, shampoo, blow dryer, towels, toilet paper, napkins, etc) and VERY comfortable shower (glass doors). Sleep quality: our room had a view to the train station. Throughout the night, you can see the trains as well as hear the announcements at the station. I got used to the announcements and the passing trains and I LOVED it, as it adds a very futuristic urban twist to the whole experience. I understand that someone else might find this noise to be a nuisance but for us it was a plus, a feeling that we are in the heart of Berlin and feeling its pulse. Location: cannot get any better!! A stone's throw from the Central Station of Berlin where from you can go everywhere. Also a walking distance from major attractions such as the Reichstag, the Branderburg Gate, etc. Staff: super-friendly, young and modern. Gives you the feeling that you are in a student house or something. And they are professional and helpful at the same time. Breakfast: NOT included in the room price, you have to pay 5.5 euro extra (per person). However, we found it to be the cheapest and best deal as in Berlin to get a full breakfast you have to pay more (around 8-9 euro). Breakfast is served in a well-lighted, super-modern and urban-chic lounge with a rather pleasant atmosphere. The breakfast buffet does not offer a huge variety of stuff as I have seen in other hotels, however everything you might need is there. You can serve yourself as much as you like, and also it is served until unusually late in comparison to other Hotels (11:30 in August). I presume that this is especially useful to late-sleepers and party animals! Cleanliness: perfect, the maid comes in every day, and she can also change your towels if you wish so. All in all the room was so neat! Wi-fi: this is a downside, that you have to pay if you want wi-fi in the room,and wi-fi in the lobby is pretty slow. However, there are a few public computers where access on key sites (such as transportation and berlin info-related) is free. Overall we didn't bother with wi-fi but someone who absolutely needs it as, for example, to work, should be aware that this is not the best wi-fi spot in the universe. Airport transportation: like I said, it is a stone's throw from Berlin Central Station. It is directly connected with airports. The station itself is a marvel to look at! Value: dare I say that you get MORE that what you pay for! We expected less for the price we paid, we thought we would have just some basic accommodation and a place to shower and sleep. However it turned out that our hotel room was an experience in itself and something that we will miss! Overall experience: perfect! I would recommend this to anyone who likes a modern, urban aesthetic and who doesn't mind a little noise and a youthful crowd. If you're looking for a more low-key and quiet stay then this is not your place.

It's definitely a place I'd return to, just in slightly cooler weather!", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay in Berlin\u201d", "Author": "lisboa100", "ReviewID": "UR79795874", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for 1 night before ongoing on trip to Copenhagen. The hotel is brand new and is exactly as advertised on their website. Rooms are clean and comfortable and have some storage facilities. I recommend this hotel, since is right next to Berlin Central Railway Station and all major tourist attractions are within 5 stops on both east and west directions. Berlin is a very big city and being central is essential to fully enjoy the city. It can also be easily reached after a night out. Free wireless internet connection is only available in the lobby and in the rooms there is a charge. If you do not wish to pay the 5.50 Euros for the breakfast, no problem at all, there is a good bakery right next door offering breakfast from 2.90 Euros. Inside the central railway station there are plenty of restaurants, a supermarket and a 24 hours pharmacy. The only negative points about this hotel are noisy teenagers in the public areas, but then this is not the hotel fault. I strongly advise potential guests to check out the German school vacation timetable (it differs from state to state) and choose a date when the teenagers will be at school. Most of the reception staff is friendly and polite, I only had a problem at check-in, although I approached the reception in German, the employee insisted in speaking in English. I live in Germany and I had already had a few similar experiences, this all, but polite. But one cannot judge the whole hotel, because of just one employee.

The amazing new central station is a minute's walk away meaning we could get all over the city by U-Bahn and S-Bahn incredibly easily and the TXL bus from Tegel Airport drops you off almost outside. Rooms are clean, modern and well equipped for what you pay for. Also I found the bed comfortable - and I say that as someone who has real problems sleeping in hotel beds. Staff were also polite and we found breakfast perfectly adequate for what we wanted, although a little pricey under the circumstances. The only downside was just one hand and bath towel in the bathroom and you have to pay a deposit for additional towels at reception.

There's a quite small kitchen for guests to cook in and a bar and space to hang out. The station is enormous and packed full of every fast food chain you can think of plus more healthy ones selling fruit and yogurt pots. Also a supermarket - so we at there quite often. Hotel is very good vaue for city centre and amazing to be so close to major sights such as Reichstag. Views from the roof terrace are beautiful all across the city. Only downside is that we slept with window open and I was woken by the train announcements early in the morning - but I am a light sleeper and after a few days got used to it.

Admittedly, it's in a good location given it's location right next to the main station, but for now other than the main station itself, there isn't much to see or do. The Reichstag is a bit of a distance away and may be too far for some to walk to. MInd you, that isn't too much of a problem since the S-Bahn connects to Alexanderplatz or the area around Kurf\u00fcrstendamm in a few minutes, and the U-Bahn is a nice shortcut to Unter der Linden and the Brandenburg Gate. Since I stayed in a single room, I can't comment on the hostel facilities, but I will note that the rooms are well appointed with modern, near-designer grade furniture and bathroom fixtures. The photo featured on their website of the room is effectively what you'll get, so there's nothing misleading on the part of the website. The bed is a bit harder than I'm used to, and the pillow was large and fluffy, but I I suspect this is more in line with European tastes. The rooms were clean with fresh linens and towels. The housekeeping staff does a good job of keeping the hotel clean. I'll also note that the flat panel TV was a nice touch, and featured mostly German-speaking channels with France 2 and BBC World News as the only real useful channels for Anglophones. I happened to have a view on the south side of the building, so I lucked out with a relatively decent view of the city from my sixth floor room. If you're a railfan, you may want to request a room on the north or west portion of the building to get some track views of the station. Despite being next to the main station, it's not relatively noisy as long as the windows are closed. If the windows are open, then one may hear a periodic siren from a police car or an errant announcement from a station or a train or car passing by. If you're ultra sensitive, it may be a problem, but otherwise, it's just background noise and nothing more. As for the breakfast, the 5 Euro fee is effectively an convenience fee for providing some bread, deli meats, yogurt, basic cereals, and orange juice. It's not bad, but it's not exactly the widest selection either. One thing I'll note is that the hotel skews heavily toward younger travelers. If you're intimidated by the prospect of being around young, pretty European tourists, then I suspect you won't like the vibe here. One must remember that this is a hostel too, and there are lots of young people on vacation. During my stay, they were quiet and well behaved and don't bother the older tourists, but one must take that into account if you're choosing to stay here. I'll also note that the wi-fi isn't free in the rooms. Yes, it's free in the lobby, but sometimes, you may want a private browsing session, and you'll simply have to pay up to 25 EUR for that. I'll also note that the air conditioning in my room wasn't of much use, but luckily the windows can open to a relatively wide angle allowing lots of fresh air in. As I said before, it's a good hotel, but it's not a great hotel. If one wants to have a relatively nice modern looking hotel at 75 euros a night in a relatively decent compromise area between both halves of the city, then it's not a bad place. If you're on a budget and not willing to splurge, then go elsewhere or hope for a good discount online. If you're looking for a beautiful room with no compromises, then this hotel will never make you content. If you're looking for a way to feel special while not spending too much money, then this hotel may fit the bill.", "Date": "August 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location to enjoy Berlin\u201d", "Author": "AjarnDavid", "ReviewID": "UR71707224", "Content": "Meininger Hotel is next to Berlin's main central train station.

The room was equipped with a TV and radio, full length mirror, bathroom facilities. Pretty basic - but we weren't there that much. The best bit of the room by far was the view. I can't swear every room has this view but all the rooms I went in had what I would say is one of the best city views I have ever seen. It was amazing. As for the decorations: To be honest, it looks like a super trendy ikea showroom! If you did happen to find the rooms to cramped- there is a roof terrace and large lobby were guests are invited to hang out which was great for us. I'd definatley recommend this hostel however, if you are the sort of people who will spend a lot of time there it might not be ideal.

It is..and it isn't. I had read the reviews and, because I was leading a discerning group of 50 and 60-somethings, the mention of kids made me start to think twice about my booking. However, when we arrived by train and saw how close the Meininger was that sealed it. Yes, there were lots of teenagers of varying nationalities in the lobby and bar areas during the evenings but they caused no problems at all. Yes, there was one isolated incident of \"adolescent high jinks\" but waiting an extra few minutes for the lift is surely better than possibly sharing a hotel with a gang of immature, middle-aged drunks on a stag weekend - and usually British, sadly!. I must also say that during our stay there was no disruption around our rooms at all. I think it's because the younger guests are accommodated in group rooms on the first few floors. They don't frequent the higher floors where \"normal\" guests are. The en-suite rooms themselves are not massive but they are spotlessly clean and more than adequate if you are out and about all day. How much time do you want to spend in a hotel room anyway? The breakfasts were plentiful with a variety of cereals, bread, fruit, meats and pates, cheese and preserves. You will never have to ask for anything; the buffet is constantly replenished. I can't say the same about the evening meals though. We arrived around 7.30pm, having travelled for 12 hours, and a relaxing meal in the hotel was planned. However, we were advised by the ever helpful staff that the single menu of roast chicken, boiled potatoes and salad was aimed at the kids. They did point us in the direction of some good eating places two S-bahn stops away but, on re-entering the station, we found the food court catered for most tastes and served beer too! By the way, that railway station has to be on your places-to- visit list in Berlin. For Brits, imagine Lakeside, McArthur Glen or Meadowhall with trains on all levels! Not only is the hotel handy for the station, it is within walking distance of the Reichstag and Brandenburg Gate. There is a taxi rank outside and the hop-on/hop-off tour buses stop near the front doors. And do visit the top floor (that door at the back of the lift opens) and enjoy the superb views across Berlin.

Breakfast is more than adequate with different types of bread rolls, ham, cheese, toast, cereals, yoghurt etc and it's also on until quite late - I think maybe 10.30am on the weekends which gives you chance for a lie in. As we were part of a school group we also had dinner included, the food again was great and if you didn't like what was on offer there was again bread rolls with ham and cheese to fill you up.
