{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Party! Party! Party! This Hotel is great if you want to do .... whatever. Everything is near by. I went there as a tourist for a weekend with some friends from the military and we had a blast. All the bars and clubs are near by. It is very safe because no matter what time it is the streets are packed with people and everything is lit up. The Hotel is a little pricy I think when I went I paid about $200 a night and the room is real small, but it was worth it because of it's location. I would definitely recommend this hotel to tourists and people that want to party.", "Date": "Feb 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR301760290", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "pimpintops"}, {"Content": "Location, location, location I stayed at Hotel Arca Torre Roppongi for two nights in November 2006. This is probably THE most conveniently located hotel in Roppongi -- only yards from Roppongi Kousaten (crossroad) and metro exit and a few minutes' walk from the Roppongi Hills complex, everything is right on the doorstep. I stayed in Roppongi to visit its salsa clubs and that meant walking around late at night, but as a single female I felt really safe -- you just walk down brightly lit streets crowded with people towards the metro station and past Cafe Almond (which is still open and busy when you come out of clubs -- it ruined my diet!), and you are at your hotel. The hotel is only a couple of years old and its facilities were new and clean. The reception staff were welcoming and helpful. My single room was small as one would expect but had a comfortable double-sized bed. My room faced the back of the building rather than the main street, so outside noise was surprisingly absent. The bathroom was tiny but spotlessly clean.The deal I had included a free bottle of water, two cans of beer and nibbles in the room plus breakfast in the downstairs cafe. The breakfast however turned out to be only one piece of toast served with a glass of orange juice and a cup of tea or coffee. You can pay extra to get a proper breakfast set though, and overall the hotel represents a good value for money -- not exactly a cheap place (if you want cheap, go to the Asia Centre), but an incredibly convenient and pleasant enough place to stay without a luxury price tag.The basement of the hotel is a slick-looking izakaya specialising chicken dishes, and I found the food there very good. Of course, there are hundreds of restaurants and bars nearby so you are not stuck for choice when it comes to eating.I would definitely go back to Arca Torre, especially if I'm travelling on my own again, and would recommend it to friends.", "Date": "Jan 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR292527703", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Gataloca"}, {"Content": "An economical and convenient hotel       Hotel room", "Date": "Jun 12, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR332638019", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "connoisseur_Taipei"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066451-d613768-r6775276-Hotel_Arca_Torre_Roppongi-Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "613768", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
