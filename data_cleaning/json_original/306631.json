We arrived just after midnight, as our flight was delayed and we also collected our hire car. We stayed here for four nights, as part of an eleven night stay. Check in was a smooth process with no problems. We initially had booked a Dulex Room booked, all paid for and booked through Expedia. However, on check in the Gentleman kindly upgraded us (without asking) to an Executive Room after seeing our child. The Executive room was bigger with a small separate living area which had a sofa bed. Two members of staff who bought our luggage up, also kindly converted the sofa bed into a bed for my son to sleep in. The room was very clean with no issues with housekeeping. Bathroom was also clean with no issues with hot water or cleanliness. I also found the bed comfortable. We had breakfast included in our stay and in my personal opinion I thought it was ok with decent choice. This hotel is the Ascot hotel and there is also a sister hotel called Royal Ascot Hotel. This is next door and is linked internally. I found the staff friendly and had no issues with them. The hotel is on a busy main road, however, our room was on the side of the building and we had no issues with noise. Our room was on the 2nd floor, so we no issue with noise internaly. The only downside was with had a view of the Royal Ascot Hotel, this building was only 10 yards away and the view was not pleasing. It is also right across the road from Meena Bazaar, where there are many cheap Indian Restaurants. There were some issues in other TA reports about ladies of the night. We did not see any nor had any problems. This could be because we did not go to the Bar. Overall this hotel is good, but would be more suited for someone who is going to be out during the day and want a decent place to sleep. This is what we did, so it suited us.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cBAAAADDDDDD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "YSARELLE", "ReviewID": "UR125870063", "Content": "I called to asked about their function room for an orientation & the Lady Receptionist connected me to another line which to my dismay nobody answered.

We could here loud \"indiginous\" music coming from a nightclub within the Hotel which finished at 0300am. On the second day, the room cleaner did not leave any replacement bath towels which were eventually supplied after two phone calls to reception. On the 3rd night, this nightclub came to life at 1100pm with loud thumping continuous music. On complaining to Reception, I was told, \"no problem, I'll let the manager know and get back to you\". The music did finish, but I never received the return phone call. I complained to the Guest services person (Anastasia) and gave all the details to her. She was surprised by the lack of attention given by the night reception staff and was surprised when we were not offered another room. I don't think moving rooms would have helped this situation as the music was that loud, it would have been heard in Abu Dabhi. (Anastasia) appeared to be quite sympathetic to our complaint and informed us that she would be contacting the Hotel manager by email, especially after I requested a refund for the price of the room for 1 night. She later confirmed that she had sent this email to the manager and would inform us of any update on our request. Needless to say, words do come cheap, as by the time we left this Hotel at 1145pm that night there was no information from (Anastasia) or the Hotel manager in relation to this matter.

It was a good hotel, and the rooms were quite large and roomy, with two separate cupboards meaning more than the usual amount of hanging space. We both thought the hotel was good, but neither of us were blown away either. Little things niggled - for example, there was no tea or coffee facilities in the room. Moreover, in the bathroom, only limited toiletries were offered - with shampoo and body wash being accessible via a dispenser in the shower space rather than in individual bottle. Not big things, but seemed to lend a slightly cheaper air to the hotel than I think it would hope for. Also, as many others have mentioned, there did seem to be some very loud music rumbling through the hotel when we arrived at 1am in the morning. That said, once we shut the bedroom door, we really couldn't hear it. Rooms don't appear to have any views, and we looked over a back alley way and housing area. The hotel does appear to have a number of restaurants and although we did not eat at the hotel, we did take breakfast which was fine. The Ascot is flush against the Royal Ascot and guests at the Ascot are able to use the Royal Ascot's pool and spa facilities.

Anyway, it was asked for and produced, but after check in, the gent who was handling that kind of thing hadn't bothered making a copy, so reception kept it until I asked for it back. The air conditioning in the room was almost louder than the night club around the corner. We asked to be moved because of the noise and the hotel sent a gentleman to check the noise. He was \"going to check\" and of course, nothing. Technically there was a balcony. Luckily it was covered by curtains. The view was the usual mix of Middle East airconditioners and satellite dishes with cables running for miles and miles. As usual, the internet access fees were quite simply a legal form of extortion. The photos on the website are mainly of the Royal Ascott Hotel next door (don'tget confused!). The roof top bar is non existent and the entire pool area and furnishings are entirely run down. Sunbeds don't even get made up any more (the pool and rooftop bar belong to the Royal Ascott). It may be just me, but I'm not entirely sure vacuming reception at 3pm with what is potentially the world's loudest vacum cleaner is the best way to endear yourself to one's customers. The \"Customer Relations\" desk appeared to be manned by an Eastern European woman with very little interest in her customers, but seemed pretty enthralled with the phone conversations \"back home.\" Couldn't even be bothered telling us what a reasonable price for a taxi would be from Point A to Point B. While enjoying a meal I thought it would be nice to add some tomato sauce. After attempting to get a \"waiter's\" attention, I figured it would be easier to fetch the sauce myself. After sitting back down, I opened the bottle and was quickly covered in tomato sauce. Do you know what causes tomato sauce to spurt out of a twist top bottle? The answer is that bacteria grows and causes pressure. So I was covered in bacteria infected tomato sauce! So was the rest of the table and my chair and my shirt and the adjoining tables. I was able to get the attention of a staff member, and he seemed very concerned; about the sauce on the chair next to mine. This hotel is a joke. Do not stay there.
