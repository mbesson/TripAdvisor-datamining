The location is good as it is about 10-15 minutes walk to Piccadelly Circus, and also just a few steps from Hyde Park. It is next to Shepards market where you find restaurants and some typical English pubs. The hotel is in a backstreet, and looks nice from the outside and also the reception area was also OK. Check in was quick, and I was given a \"deluxe\" room. I took the tiny elevator to the 5 floor. The room was big enough for the 2 nights, the bathroom really small. The room was basically clean, but there were stains on the carpet that probably is impossible to get rid of without replacing it. Also the grouting of the bathroom tiles was really worn and needs an update. The remote control to the TV could have benefited from a good scrubbing... Yuck! The temperature in the room was perfect, so no need to turn on the portable oil heater that was available.Bed was good, slept well as the room also turned towards the backyard I heard no noise from outside. Not very good soundproofing inside the hotel, so could hear the guests in the next door room, but thankfully they also went to bed at a decent hour. TV had very few channels, less than 10 I guess. The free WI-FI worked perfectly in my room. There were no safe, minibar, hair drier or any other extras. There were however coffee and tea to make in the room. The bathroom was barely OK. Large towels are always nice, the bathtub was not tempting to lay in, but water temperature and pressure in the shower was OK. There were also bathrobes available. I did not eat breakfast at this hotel. The woman that checked me out did not show any interest in asking me how the stay had been or saying goodbye... GBP 255 for the 2 nights, just not good value for money. It is hard to rate this hotel, I give it 3, but really it is between 2 and 3.

There were oil radiators plugged in all over the hotel which is not ideal. My biggest concern was I ordered full breakfast in our room as it was my partners birthday and it was horrible.

My room was smaller than my pocket, the ceiling paint was peeling, and the room had an electric space heater to make up for the leaky windows. As others have remarked, I also had a nice view (and was within earshot) of the dumpsters from the Hilton out back. Also, the fire alarm went off twice while I was in my room, because someone's shower made too much steam, and the smoke detector was to close to the bathroom (that's how small the rooms were).

That's what you're paying for, and it's a LOT less than the other hotels in the area. It's a trade off, but for me, it was worth it. I left my room at 8 am, and didn't come home until past 10 pm.

Avoid it if you can, wouldnt spend more than 1 or 2 nights there again unless if I absolutely have to.

The hotel is in a great location and is cheaply priced for it's location, however it's marketed as a 4 star which it is not! \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2The general appearance of the public areas (lift/hallways etc) are very tatty and out dated, both lifts have carved 'graffiti' on the inside of the doors. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2The above theme continued in to our room which desperately needs a refurbishment. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2There is a large crack on the counter/dressing table. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2There is also a large crack in the sink. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2There are 3 tiles missing in the bathroom under the (cracked) sink. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2The shower rail is covered in rust and some of the screws that hold it up are starting to come away and are very loose, this is potentially very dangerous. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2The extractor fan in the bathroom doesn't work. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2All the rooms (I assume all rooms as nearly every review on tripadvisor.com mentions it) have oil filled heaters in them. Why doesn't your central heating work correctly and where was the air conditioning that your website boasts? \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2The trouser press wasn't attached to the wall properly and was coming away. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2It took about 6 or 7 minutes for hot water to come through the shower in the afternoon, what a waste of water! (Again, mentioned on tripadvisor.com) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2I had to ask twice to have an iron and ironing board sent up and when it arrived the ironing board only had a thin, cotton ironing board cover and no padding thus rendering it pretty useless. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2The tissue box in the bathroom had not been refilled, it only had 3 tissues in it and there were only 1 and a bit toilet rolls. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2The hairdryer was beyond useless as it over heated with about 30 seconds of use and we had to wait for it to cool before we could use it again and this took around 5 minutes. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Your website shows a wide selection of 'Molton Brown' toiletries on display in the bathroom, we had the 'Molton Brown' holder, not the nice toiletries to match. I don't think Molton Brown would be happy to know that their product is being cheapened by your hotel! \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2The net curtain was dirty and had some holes in it, it also had some bodge repairs with pins at the top. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2At least one of the towels had a hole in. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2The breakfast was pretty poor on all accounts.

Having read the reviews here I was naturally anxious about staying at this hotel. Initially I was actually very happy as I had been upgraded to a suite which was certainly very spacious. However, given that this was supposedly the best suite in the hotel then I honestly dread to think what the other rooms are like. So, overall quality issues: -The carpet was stained in places and appeared very \u00e2\u20ac\u0153weathered\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if it was actually really dirty or just very old. -The grouting between the tiles in the bathroom was heavily stained in places (photo). -There was black mould on the ceiling in the shower area (photo). -The wooden toilet seat had split in several places which is a hygiene issue which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bare thinking about (photo). -There was chipped paintwork on all the door frames and skirting boards. -The mattress was quite phenomenally uncomfortable and I have bruises to prove it. -The full length mirror in the wardrobe was cracked. -The heating was so noisy that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possible to sleep with it on. -There was only just enough pressure in the cold water tap to get a slow trickle of water which stopped completely if you flushed the toilet. There are plenty of other standards set out by the star rating agencies where this hotel fails to meet the requirements of a four star or some of these even apply to 1 star: -Only 1 bedside lamp (Should have 2). -No hotel information given on check in. -No luggage assistance offered. -No \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd guest directory or information. -No published phone charges. -No hair dryer. -No apparent laundry service. -No heated towel rail. -No invoice/receipt presented on departure. I know that individually each point I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve raise may sound petty, but when I see so many poor maintenance and service issues then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a different story. I had a glance around reception to ascertain whether or not this hotel is registered with Visit England or the AA and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it is (hardly surprising as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d definitely fail a hotel inspection). This means that the 4 stars they advertise as is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self assessed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Having said all that, the location is just behind the Park Lane Hilton and it is considerably cheaper than the alternatives in the area.

We were informed we could only have a continental breakfast which we had to eat in our rooms! They upgraded us to a luxury double with ensuite sitting room for no extra cost, however, the room had no view, it was hot and claustraphobic and there were no paintings on the wall (no money spared for any comforts), or table/chairs to eat our breakfast only a sofa. We had no choice but to accept as by now it was 09.30 pm. We definitely feel ripped off and in future will only be staying in the reliable 'Premier Inn' which are all over England and good value for money and very comfortable. We will also be adding this note onto the review section for 'The Knightsbridge Green Hotel'. By the sounds of the other reviews this is also a big 'NO NO'.", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, California", "Title": "\u201cHospitable Location Inhospital Receptionists\u201d", "Author": "dessertarian", "ReviewID": "UR47372558", "Content": "We have stayed at this hotel numerous times.

She even muttered an obscenity about her computer in our presence. If she had not treated another guest w/ equal disdain, I would have taken her attitude personally. In the two days we stayed there, I only heard her say, \"Thank you\" once!

I've no doubt that this meant that we got a lower standard room than if we'd booked with the hotel direct and paid their standard rack rate. I'm fine with that, but I still have certain minimum standards for a hotel and the Park Lane Mews didn't quite meet them. If a hotel is in a location and charges a price that suits me, then (as long as I'm not being charged for something particularly special that I don't get) I'm OK provided I get four things, especially when I'm only staying there one night. A clean room; at a comfortable temperature; with a comfortable bed; and a good hot shower or bath. The Park Lane Mews only managed three, which is simply not good enough for a hotel that claims to be four star. OK, so we didn't get up till 9am (breakfast wasn't included and we weren't in any hurry), but I'd still expect a 4 star hotel to be able to provide sufficient hot water for all their guests. It wasn't even lukewarm. The water from the hot taps in the basin and bath was barely distinguishable from that from the cold taps. I would describe it as off-cold! The decor in the room was also a little tired. I wouldn't go as far as to say shabby, but it was heading in that direction. The carpet, though clean, had a worn and greyish look that spoke of its age. The corners of the wallpaper were peeling a little, and there was a chip in the bath. Nothing very bad, and entirely livable with, but not quite what I'd expect for a 4 star hotel in Mayfair. The renovations spoken of in the manager's responses here are, I would suggest, well overdue. The sound insulation within the hotel was also poor. Fortunately, our neighbours were considerate, but my still-sleeping husband was woken up with a start when the doorbell of the room next door was rung at 7am - he thought it was ours and it was certainly loud enough to be a possibility. We were then able to hear, fairly clearly, the conversation of the people in that room. If they had spoken a language I understand, I would probably have been able to make out just about every word. And they were obviously just speaking in normal voices. I'd hate to be staying there with noisy people in a neighbouring room. When we mentioned the lack of hot water on checking out (there really wasn't any point in mentioning it before - we weren't staying and it was hardly something that there'd be a quick fix for), the receptionist thanked us for telling her, but I got the impression that she didn't really understand why we were telling her, that the message wouldn't be passed on, and we didn't even get an apology. I had very little to do with the staff (my husband arrived before me and checked in), but this one experience did not impress me. While an apology fixes nothing, it does at least give the impression that the staff care whether their guests are comfortable. The hotel isn't a bad one. It's just not a particularly good one. For the price we paid, given its location, and the fact that we were only there one night (and were able to have a good hot shower at home later that day), it was fine. If I'd booked to stay there for any longer and/or paid any more, then I'd have been very disappointed. In its favour, the location is hard to beat and, at lastminute's Top Secret hotel prices, it's still not a bad deal if you just want somewhere to sleep after a night out in town.", "Date": "December 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cLoved this wonderful Gem\u201d", "Author": "OrlaH98", "ReviewID": "UR22473388", "Content": "Just had a wonderful stay at Park Lane Mews Hotel for 2 nights at the end of November.

The only modern facility was the large flat screen TV fitted squintly on the wall and which tended to dominate teh fairly small room. No comfortable chair or sofa in the room and the advertsied wireless internet did not work in the rooms and according to the receptionist never has done! The bathrooms were very small with a bath panel that had rotted due to water leaking. The grouting on the tiles and sealant around the bath was breeding fungus quite well. Really the only good thing about the room was being at the back of the hotel it was quiet. The lounge area was an extension of the reception area and only had seating for 10-12 persons, again the furniture was very tired. You can sit in this area to have a drink from a limited bar, only one malt whisky available, but be prepared from the noise from a rather loud male receptionist who whilst I was sitting there had two arguments with other members of staff and tried to assure anouther guest that the sparks coming from the temporary heater in his bedroom was nothing to worry about but if we was still worried he could turn it off!

I've booked rooms like this with lastminute and in the past haven't been disappointed but I guess there's a first time for everything! Before you book lastminute give you a description of the accommodation and in this case it was a glowing description of a 4 star, boutique hotel in the heart of Mayfair. To be fair, the location is excellent and paying \u00c2\u00a3106 for a single note for decent accommodation in this part of town is pretty good. However this rate is damaged by the fact that breakfast costs an exorbitant \u00c2\u00a314.95 each for ingredients that look and taste like they were bought from Netto and cooked by a blindfolded boy scout. If you stay here get your breakfast somewhere else as there are plenty of great places nearby. Back to the hotel experience. Well it's simply not 4 star. Not even close. The staff were friendly and yes we pre-paid but who cares? On arrival in what can only be decsribed as a bijou reception and lounge bar area there was a fairly loud and obvious recruitment interview between one of the hotel admin and 3 potential non-UK recruits. One could not avoid hearing how the hotel appeared to have a disregard for the need of any experience in potential recruits. Even when one of the hopefuls admitted they could not cook the hotel manager suggested that perhaps they might be able to prepare simple things (perhaps the English breakfast that we were due to enjoy later?). It did make us concerned about the hotels attitude towards hygiene, health and safety. The room and the floor that we stayed on however smelt strongly of cigarette smoke. After reading some of these earlier reviews we decided to stick with room rather than get a transfer as we didn't want any of the experiences reported elsewhere on this review site. The \"King Size\" double bed we booked turned out to be two single beds pushed together. The air conditioning did not work which was a shame given that London was hitting 30 degrees outside. The shower had little water pressure and only luke warm water in the evening which dropped to an unusable trickle in the morning that was cold. Forget about Internet and there's no mini-bar or fresh water in the rooms. If you're looking for an inexpensive room for the night in London this isn't the worst you could do. The location is genuinely great and as long as you're only sleeping in the room then everything else you need is nearby. Just don't book it thinking that you are getting a 4 star bargain because you're getting an expensive 3 star hotel in a good spot.

He then asked me how I would like to pay and I said in cash he then said thats \u00c2\u00a3174. He wanted the money there and then and said, now get this, \"This is the policy of all the hotels in London.\" No it isnt sunshine, Ive stayed in Better, more expensive and better managed and I have NEVER had to pay in advance, Maybe it was because of my Northern Accent, I dont know I paid the money then he asked for a \u00c2\u00a350 deposit to act as a surity. Er excuse me, this isnt an 18-30 holiday in Magaluff, I am away for the weekend for a show with my wife (Who was with me) What do you think Im going to do, steal a towel. He said it was the hotel policy (I still have yet to find it) I said well Im not paying it (Basically I didnt have enough cash on me as I was meeting someone that night). At this point there was 3 more couples in the foyer and it was getting embarrasing so I had to tell him I wasnt discussing it there in front of others and wanted to go to my room.If he wanted to discuss it he could come and see me. We went up to room 205 which we was told was no smoking. I opened the door and before taking a step said to my wife, I am not stopping in there. It smelt like an Amsterdam Coffee shop. I went in and the window was open with fag ash all over the window ledge. I went down and was given another room, 305 which was directly above. Oh by the way, never told where the room was just given the key card. Went in 305 and smelt alot better. However, that was the end of the plesantries. We went out then came back 3 hours later and the wife went to the shower. She must have run the water for 15 mins and the water came luke warm. I admit, I went in after her and it was hot. The sink wouldnt drain away and took about 5 mins to clear. The bathroom panel was mank and mouldy and the tiles behind the toilet had been broken and it looked as if Stevie Wonder had attempted to repair them with David Blunkett as his labourer (I think you will get the picture). The plasma telly had been installed but they had left all the wires visible and dangling from the television down to the plug. The view (which was supposed to be of a courtyard) was of the bin store or the scaffolding on the building opposite though I couldnt really tell as we werent allowed to open the window as it was damaged and had a big sign on. There was no mini bar, fridge or biscuits. The bed was a good size and good pillows . Ok,we were only staying for a night but decided to go down for luch as the show started at 7:30. We were downstairs at 5:56 (yes 4 minutes to 6) and asked for a table and was told, very politely, \"We dont open until 6 sir so you will have to wait in reception.\" He then said I will have to advise you of the things we dont have. There was I believe 6 things on the menu however, they didnt have 3 which left me with a Indian Chicken Curry, The vegetarian meal or the salmon. I just lost the plot and stormed out. The next day on checking out I asked for a taxi and was told to walk to the Hilton where there would be loads of taxis. Couldnt find one so had to walk to Hyde Park. Now I have been a contractor and stopped in \u00c2\u00a325 pn B&Bs and when I am away with my wife I try and stop at the best in London.

I believe in going with an open mind despite reading the recent bad comments on TripAdvisor that this Hotel had been getting. Surely it cannot be that bad? Except yes it really is. First impressions of the building outside and inside the reception is very good, it looks very nice. Until you check in. As soon as you walk in, before saying Hello, you say your name they find the booking and demand full payment, when I questioned could I not pay at the end, they said in a loud stern voice NO I had to pay and did I want to stay or not. Great start !! So I hand over my card, and it is my card as I don't get a company one and its debited. I was asked non smoking or smoking opted for non smoking, and allocated a room on the top floor. Room Impression - On 1st impressions looked not too bad until I turned on the light which by the way you have to put the card in the slot for any lights to work, which isn't mentioned anywhere. Carpet was filthy. Wall paper something out of the 70's. It was thundering and lighting and had been pouring with rain all day he window was open and water drops all over the table. I tried to close the window, and part of it fell to pieces, so its now at an angle. More force and I got it shut and put the broken parts to one side (at least it was shut !!) Air Con unit on the wall again looks about 20 years old, had a red light on it but I had instructions as to how to use. Except the red light meant it was out of operation, however I could still turn on even worse as it sounded as though an areoplane was about to come through the wall. Good job it didn't work. I was trying to get the room warm after the freezing cold wet window. Although you would think they would put a sign saying do not use, instead you can try and turn it on and probably blow yourself up or get an electric shock nice one !! View from window, tower scraper of the back of the Hilton Hotel which had about 10 more floors higher and I had all the fumes from the back of the Hilton breathing into my room. Yes its London but I don't expect to have more gas and smoke than a diesel train not to mention the noise of it even with my window shut. Looking further around - Flatscreen Tv, older than my CRT screen at home, like a box fixed to the wall but beneath a boarded up unit with white plyboard that would of housed an old CRT TV about 10 years ago. Bed is as hard as nails although at least I have a double bed, with plenty of pillows. Kettle has fur in it, so needed good clean out. Coffee and Tea was quite good for amounts, no biscuits or mineral water which I would expect from a 4 star hotel. Bathroom small but looked not too bad, clean. Then tried taking a shower no hot water, no pressure in the water so shower hardly came on this happened both times I used the shower. Worst was the sink it took 10 minutes for the water to drain out. Everyone knows that you have to turn a hot tap on and wait for it to become hot, however the sink was overflowing almost before the tap became lukewarm that is how bad it was. Wether this was because I was on the 5th and highest floor I don't know but it was beyond a joke. I ordered breakfast to arrive in my room, and filled out the card and attached to my door handle at 7pm. The card had to be out by 2am at the latest. Breakfast was booked for 7:15am and when it got to 7:25 I started to get worried. I opened the door of my room and found the card still attached to the door handle it hadn't even been collected and my tray from 6pm last night with a light tea on was still outside as well. I called the meal service option and was asked if I would like to order now, no apology nothng as though it was my fault and when I asked how long would I have to wait the answer \"I don't know\". Great when you got to be at a training course at a set time, thats the whole point of room service to save time !! I tried to order a taxi the night before, and the hotel refused to order one when I tried to book one in the morning as they advised I did, they told me to go to the Hilton as there was a taxi rank. I went to the taxi rank by the Hilton and asked 7 cabs to take me about 1 mile all of them said no, reason, why well I imagine because they are waiting for bigger fares coming out of the Hilton. I walked to another Taxi rank asked another 3 cabs and eventually found someone who would take me. I arrived late at my course. At last it was my time to leave, I checked out and I noticed that nobdy asked if everything was ok, nobody said thank you or stay again, when I went to raise the issues I had they said well other guest haven't complained and more or less made out I was imaging things and they didn't want to know but then they already had my money at \u00c2\u00a3244 for 2 nights rip off, plus\u00c2\u00a314.95 breakfast and \u00c2\u00a33.50 extra for room service. Travel Lodge for me by a mile anyday even Glastonbury in a tent doesn't have such rude manners. Please do not go there I cannot recommend for anyone, its a joke to say its 4 stars and there is no excuse in the world for being rude to customers and not caring when you pay not only London Prices, but 4 star prices for 1-2 star service.

I booked via Lastminute.com as a \"top secret hotel\" and paid \u00c2\u00a3140 for one night in a standard double room. The exterior of the hotel was nice, and the location was great. The check-in staff were helpful and friendly. However... This is NOT what I would consider to be a 4* hotel by any stretch of the imagination. A few Molton Brown toiletries weren't enough to compensate for peeling wallpaper, shabby decor and stained carpets. As other reviewers have commented, the room smelt of tobacco, and there were cigarette butts on my window sill. I had to call someone up to fix my shower, as it didn't work, and then when I finally got water, it was cold. The air conditioning unit also had to be reset so that it would work, and then sounded like a piece of industrial machinery so I had to switch it off anyway! The bedding and towels looked like they'd seen better days - slightly greying and a bit tatty around the edges. If you really want to stay in Mayfair, and you manage to get a deal on this hotel for under \u00c2\u00a3100 a night, it's probably OK. Personally, I'd recommend staying in the Thistle in Kensington instead: slightly cheaper, and then spend the saving on a cab!

It is mediocre - claims to be 4 star but is really a scruffy 3 star at best. I recently stayed in the Hotel and noticed that they tried to charge me for phone calls I hadn't made.

I phoned the hotel twice and was promised that this would be sorted out - but no reply on two occasions. I have written to them twice and not had a reply. I have therefore registered the payments as a \"dispute\" with my credit card provider and hope they can sort it out.

Once again, the Park Lane Mews is one of those '4-star' hotels that offers pretty average 3-star accommodation in an up-market location. I'd give it 3-stars+, but the room facilities are in no way those of a 4-star hotel. However, it's quite an attractive building, inside and outside. The public areas are nice and tasteful and a welcome change from the usual corporate blandness of major chain hotels. The location of this hotel is excellent if you'd like to explore the interesting nooks and crannies between Park Lane and Mayfair. Shepherds Market, with its interesting little shops and pubs, is just a 2 minute walk, and Green Park and Hyde Park are each 5 minutes walk away. The entire West End is on your doorstep, and is easily walkable for the able-bodied. If you have difficulty walking, take advantage of the black cabs that swarm around this area like bees around a hive. My Experience: - I checked in late (23.00) but desk staff were helpful and efficient. My room was a good size, the flat-screen TV was huge but rather elderly. The choice of channels 1-9 was uninspiring. Why can't hotels just install FreeView instead of this 'Hotel Info' and 1-9 channels? Who exactly uses this 'Hotel Info' stuff on the TV? I had booked a double, but my wife was unable to travel, so I had a huge (3-pillows-wide) bed to wallow in all by myself. The room was clean (except for the faint smell of stale tobacco smoke) and the complimentary toiletries were of excellent quality. All basic services worked as expected. Water was hot etc. Being set-back from Park Lane, the room was fairly quiet. It was a hot night, but the 'air conditioning' (a strange box thing in the corner of the room which you have to learn to program) kept me fairly comfortable. I did not eat at the Park Lane Mews so can't comment on the cuisine. Downsides: - I wasn't offered the option of a non-smoking room when booking and ended up with a room that smelled mildly of smoke. This may not have been the hotel's fault, but if it matters to you then double-check when you book. NO mini bar. POOR selection/amount of tea/coffee etc. NO biscuits, NO milk/creamer for tea/coffee. Room decor aims for a 'shabby chic' effect, but comes off looking just shabby (lime-washed woodwork that hasn't been done properly). The large cabinet that housed the original TV had been retained and a white-painted hardboard panel tacked to the front. I thought they could have removed the edifice, or at least stuck a mini-bar in it.", "Date": "May 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "farnborough", "Title": "\u201cIdeal For Our Purpose\u201d", "Author": "grove15", "ReviewID": "UR14987522", "Content": "This was an overnight stay for a birthday surprise, i was pleasantly surprised as my husband was worried after reading all the reviews.

When we arrived we asked if there were any twin beds available as my friend accidentally booked a double room. Big mistake. The lady on reception told us there weren't any but we could stay at the 'apartment' which sounded like we were being upgraded. We were sent outside to another building to a room on the top floor. The apartment was really large and at first we were quite impressed. But after putting our bags down, realised that this room was absolutely disgusting. The carpet and bathroom floor had stains, one of the plugs was caved in, the fridge in the kitchen had mould in it and the tv had loads of wires sticking out. My friend and I thought we should make the best of it as we had somewhere to be & were only staying one night. We got back around 1.30am and went to reception to be let in - we were told before that we weren't allowed a key... As we walked up the stairs to the apartment we noticed mouse traps on every corner of the stairs! Conveniently we hadn't seen these before as we were taken up in the lift. The porter then made us wait 15 minutes as he couldn't find the key to the room and had to bring up every key they had to see if it fitted. This was the last straw! My friend went to reception to complain and was told my the manager that he would 'pay her \u00c2\u00a35000 if she found a mouse in his hotel'. He then asked how much she paid for the room, which is completely irrelevant. We didn't get anywhere with the arrogant manager or the staff so decided we will complain directly with Last Minute.com to see if we can get some kind of compensation.
