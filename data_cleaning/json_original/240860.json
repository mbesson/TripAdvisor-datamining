This hotel is nicely located in the Marina, a short walk from the Ramblas and shops/restaurants. The Barcelona city tour bus stops outside too - the concierge sold us discounted tickets and reommended a 2 day ticket (which was just a few Euro than a 1 day ticket). Great tip as you can't really do everything in 1 day! Our room had a lovely view of Mont Juic and was clean and spacious. We had oom service one night which was very good and quite reasonably priced. The bathroom had both a shower and a jacuzzi style bath which was really nice after a long day walking around the city. I hae to mention the bed which was about the most comfortable I've ever slept in! The hotel bistro/bar served great food although the service was a little chaotic but I have to say entertaining. The bar area was staffed by guys in black uniforms all wearing pseudo secret service ear pieces. While it did nothing to improve the service (they were easily distracted by whoever was talking in their ears) it was very funny though and there were all very friendly so we didn't ming too much. Getting a taxi from the hotel was really easy (the concierge whistled for one which took about 20 seconds to arrive) - we needed one to go to the airport since the company we'd booked for transfers 'Aerocity' were abosolutely hopeless. Avoid at all costs. As for Barcelona,its an amazing city but you will need comfy shoes and a strong bladder - public loos are few and far between and there seemed to be a queue in most cafes/restaurants. Watch out for pettyy crime around key tourist areas too eg Ramblas and Sagrada Familia where my husband foiled a couple of thieves who were tirying to steal from someones bag. Make time ot go to Park Guell its beautiful and you can see the whole city from the viewing point. The zoo was ok too but I think the animals really need more space.

I bought a package of Expedia as a surprise gift for my wife's birthday and she was thrilled with Barcelona and the hotel too. To be honest, I was a little sceptical about this hotel and Barcelona as a whole as I had read different reviews about the hotel and extremely weird reviews about Barcelona suggesting it was intolerant to coloured people. I'm happy to say that all these misconceptions were all put to bed by the hotel's lovely staff and overall customer service in Barcelona. Absolutely loved it! Coming back to the hotel, just outside the entrance, it has a tour bus stop and I personally think that if you're in a city for a few days, the best way to check all the points of interest are by getting on one of these buses and it was very convenient. As for the room, it was nice, spacious and with a city view. Though, the hotel considers it as a city and sea view, but being a port, the sea view is rather pointless. The rooms were clean and kept to a good standard but the furniture did look a bit jaded. Room service was exceptional whenever we ordered so 5 stars for that. All in all, the hotel has a great location and going around in a taxi isn't that expensive (comparing prices to London here). I didn't quite get on the metro, so unsure how far the closes metro stop is. Lastly, we took the non-breakfast option for this hotel as spending 50 Euros between us per day wasn't ideal when restaurants are just a short walk away.

Our room was spacious as far as European hotels go. It had hardwood floors and a comfortable bed, with a small balcony. My only real gripe about the hotel was the noisiness of doors slamming all hours of the night. When you have flown overnight from the U.S. to Spain (no sleep for 36 hours), slamming doors are a bit of a problem. Other than that, the room was extremely clean and suited our tastes fine. That evening, my husband had a headache, so we ordered room service instead of going out. We ordered a margherita pizza and a pasta dish with cheese sauce. Both were excellent and well-presented. The rooftop pool is quite small, but the views from the roof are quite nice, allowing for some good picture-taking.

The rooms are large and nicely appointed, with robes and slippers for your use, and nice toiletries. The decor is definitely business impersonal--if you are looking for unique, you are looking in the wrong place. Other reviews have complained about the firmness of the beds; they were firm, but I found they were still comfortable. The service and staff are average, almost blase--everyone is polite but no one is going out of their way to make you feel special. Which they should, if you are paying the rates advertised on their website. When we first looked into staying there, a \"family suite\" was over one thousand US dollars per night. We ended up finding a good deal on expedia or hotels.com and ended up booking two rooms at 200.00 US dollars per night. The pros of this place: Large rooms, nice bathrooms, nice amenities in the room, and most importantly, it's very well located, just south of Las Ramblas. It's a short, pleasant walk to the metro, which is the cleanest and most efficient subway I have ever ridden. The gym is small but serviceable, and they have a rooftop pool, which is nice. The picture on the website makes it look much larger than it is, so don't expect to do laps. The cons: I think the price is the biggest issue standing in the way of a good recommendation here. The hotel provides breakfast at 24 Euros per adult, and 12 Euros per child. A family of four eats cheaper and better, by walking 15 minutes up to La Boqueria and finding that nice bar in the back where you can get juice and tortilla espanola for 6 Euros. Some have complained about the noise, which can be avoided if you get a view of the \"ocean\" (which is actually a view of the building just south of the hotel). We had a room directly next to the ferry, but weren't bothered by the noise. In sum, if you get a decent rate, it's worth booking, but if you are going to pay the rates on their website, there are other, better places to stay in Barcelona.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest, Romania", "Title": "\u201cNothing can beat its location!\u201d", "Author": "liviustan", "ReviewID": "UR117471185", "Content": "We spent a wonderful time in this perfectly located hotel.

Our biggest gripe of all though was the lack of sunbeds on the roof top terrace, over 350 rooms in the hotel and at the very most there was 15 sunbeds. In our week long stay we managed to get sunbeds only once. I really want to stress that we thought this hotel was of a very high standard and had some really good points like, staff friendly, cleaning spotless, shower powerful and great location.

The staff were always friendly and couldn't do enough to help you.

Also, theres a taxi rank right outside the hotel for getting to the airport (30 euros each way). Only two things to note, if you book a superior room this is actually the standard room. The room inside was amazing but the beds are rock hard and none of these rooms have a sea view, they face inwards to the world trade centre courtyard. Secondly, the drinks at the hotel are expensive, 6 euro 50 for a small beer in the minibar, 8 euros for a small beer at the bar. None of these things spoilt our weekend away as we like to go out for meals in the evenings anyway. We used the pool which was small but nice, as well as the sunbathing area. We also used the cable cars above the hotel which take you to the beach. Overall this was an amazing weekend and the atmosphere in barcelona was amazing (champions league final winners).

Not what I call 5 star and sooo expensive!\u201d", "Author": "BonneVoyager", "ReviewID": "UR93783503", "Content": "Q: How can a hotel on a marina have no sea views? A: When it is the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel and it's ocean view are blocked by the world trade centre. Yes the pictures look fab on the website ... but what they don't show is the fact that the hotel is just a small oblong part and not the huge circular building -which id the worldtrade centre. Now that was not my main gripe with this hotel as Yeego.com had asked them on my behalf for a sea view room and they had said that another building blocked their sea view but they would give us a high floor. Yes they did - A high floor facing the grey cementiness of the trade centre's high walls and unscenic courtyard. The trick would be to ask for a town view, then I think you might even get a bit of sea view thrown in on the periphery same as the view from reception. My problem was that I actually emailed them three times - once through the contact form on the website and no body bothered to answer ... ever. Disappointing! I got a good price with yeego.com 289 euros for 2 night B&B. That is good compared with the other websites. I know hotels are overall expensive in Barcelona but 289 was way too mjuch to pay for a stay in the Eurostars Grand Marina in my opinion as it realy lacked the wow factor except for it's location which as I mentioned before is a bit of a waste to put a hotel on a marina and then have no sea views. Hmmm. We got a very nice welcome on check in from (forgive me I can't remember her name) a charming young lady with morrocan heitage and were brough up to our room by an equally charming and helpful Luis. All at the desk were the height of friendliness and professionality at all times - and the conceireges were so very nice and helpful. One good thing about the hotel is that it is situated right beside a hop-on-hop-off sightseeing bus stop which services all the tour buses. Our room was a good size, but with a matress like one slab of rock - so very very very hard! I had a back injury 4 years ago and not a twinge since until I slept in this bed ... and now 3 days on my back is agony.Perhaps coincidence but it was very very uncomfortable. Howver you were given a pillow menu of all sorts and fabrics.I ordered 3 on our second night to try and offset the effects of the rock hard matress and although they were nice the so called scented one could not be diferentiated from the rest. We also had a mini bar, nice but small balcony and quite small tv, though a great range of channels. The bathroom featured a hydro massage bath which was great, but what a shame the bath was so tiny. The shower/lighting/twin sinks and seperate loo/bidet area were all very nice as were the tolletries and cosy slippers, though I could not find any robes. All in all I would have guessed I was staying in a plesant 4 star hotel. The breakfast was very nice and a great selection of very delicious food. However my breakfast on the second day was completely ruined by the restaurant manager Albert who took great exception to my ordering an omlette for my husband who had not yet come down and made a terrific fuss about having it sent up by room service and frankly made me feel like a criminal when I explained that my husband was ill but should he not showw up I would like to prepare a small breakfast for him to bring up. I was told they would not let me add sauces etc to the omlette they had prepred but were keeping warm in the kitchen and all my husband need would be provided on the tray instead of my simply making it the way he wanted before it was delivered. Naturally I took this up with the manager on duty who was most charming and apologetic and explained it was a misunderstanding to which I replied that I thought that no missunderstanding gave the restaurant manager the right to bully a guest so they felt unwelcome and overcome with embarrasment over breakfast. Perhaps it was just a misunderstanding and language problem but I have never been subject to such treatment ever and I have certainly not been made to feel so much like a naughty child since indeed I was a naughty child!!!! Anyway I realise this was a one off and so my views of the hotel are not affected by this, but I truly think you could do better than the Eurostars Grand Marina. My second choice was The Pullman Skipper, but as we passed it on the tour bus I was unimpressed both by its dreary pison like facade and location. When I return I will be looking for a hotel near the Port Vell region, by the beach and all those fab prominades. My advice on Eurostars - not worth 289 euros B&B for a double for 2 nights, lacks wow factor and really you should expect a 4 star. Roof top pool and free laptops to use on fiorst floor a great asset, the bar was lovely (cocktails 12 euros ...ouch!), beds the most uncomfortable ever, no view, too far from La Rambla .... think you can do so much better and hopefully for less!", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cLuxurious, well located and comfortable hotel.\u201d", "Author": "maincene", "ReviewID": "UR92048076", "Content": "I have spent one week in this hotel for business purpose.

We live in Denver and are in our mid 40's and 50's, not youngsters but not senior citizens, either. This was our first trip to Europe and we did a lot of research about Barcelona's hotel's before we selected this hotel. We were not disappointed. We have traveled extensively in the United States, Carribbean, Mexico and Hawaii and we usually stay in better than average hotels. We don't like to stay in cheap hotels but we try not to break the bank either. We chose this hotel because we knew we wanted to be close to La Ramblas and the marina and other attractions. One end of La Ramblas is only about 1/4 mile away or a 5-7 minute walk. The hotel is also right on the marina and the mall,restaurants, and aquarium are all right there next to the hotel, also only a 5 -10 minute walk. There are some smaller cruise ships and ferrys that dock right next to the hotel but the larger cruise ships arrive/depart from a different port about 5-7 minutes away by taxi. I would recommend looking at the hotel's website at www.grandmarinahotel.com to get a better idea about the hotel. First of all, you'll see a picture of a large, round building. The hotel is actually just the front quarter of that building that looks toward that tower in front of the hotel. The other 3/4's of that building are offices for the World Trade Center. So the views from the rooms either look out toward the city or inward to that courtyard in the middle of the trade center. We paid a little extra for a City Junior Suite room and the view was awesome, overlooking the marina and the city and hills of Barcelona. The courtyard rooms probably didn't have much of a view at all, except for the courtyard. Our room was very spacious with a king size bedroom with a fairly large bathroom and a separate living room. Unfortunately, it rained for 2 days while we were there but it was really nice to have the extra living area overlooking the marina rather than staying somplace else in a smaller, cramped room without a view. Upon arrival, the lobby was very clean, the staff very professional and friendly. They all spoke english so we felt comfortable from the moment we checked in. We found the hotel to be spotless in every area. There are a couple of computers to use free of charge for web access on the 2nd floor near the bar/lounge. We brought our laptop and they gave us 2 free hours of internet access in our room. But we had a few problems being able to log onto the web but they have an excellent technical staff who came up to our room and helped us get online. There is a fitness center with a hot tub and a small swimming pool on the top floor. (The pool doesn't open until June so it was closed when we were there in May, but that's not the hotel's fault). Barcelona's Hop on-Hop off tour bus leaves from about 100 yards from the hotel's front doors so it's very convienent for sightseeing. On our second day there, we decided to explore the courtyard in the middle of the complex and found a few restaurants that are open for the trade center workers and hotel guests. There is also a little newsstand with basic soda's, candy, medicine,etc., a travel agency, post office and pharmacy. Good to know if you just need something basic. Now I want to address some of the \"negative\" reviews that I read before we chose this hotel. First, the beds. Yes, they are a little firm, but I didn't lose any sleep with them. My wife actually liked them and she said it helped her back. Some people also complained about the noise. The hotel is on a dock where ships pull in and yes, if you have your balcony door open, you can hear them loading the ferrys and cruise ships. But when we had the door closed, we couldn't hear any of that noise. We found it interesting to watch all the activity. The breakfast in the dining room is quite expensive. It's a nice buffet, but I think we paid about 30 euros each so for about $70 USD, it was more than one should have to pay for breakfast. The restaurant wasn't open for dinner when we were there but one night when it was raining and we didn't want to go out, we ordered room service and it was good food for a fairly reasonable price. It was about $30 USD for a pizza and club sandwich with fries. Not cheap, but more reasonable than the breakfast. But we had a great time staying at this hotel. If it wasn't for 2 days of rain, it would have been a perfect first visit to Europe. Some reviews also talk about crime & pick-pockets, but we didn't have any problems with that.

We'd signed up for the \"Celebration Package\" for the 1st night and for the \"Honeymoon Package\" for the 4 nights. This is a modern hotel located in the Port area, approximately 10 minutes walk from Las Rambla. On our 1 night stay, we were upgraded to a suite, which was out of this world. On our 4 night stay, we were given the Marina Suite, which was beautiful too. Yes, the restaurant is expensive and yes, drinks are quite dear, but we expected this as it is a 5* hotel and prides itself on this. The facilities in the rooms were excellent. I'd also ordered a cake and cava for my husbands birthday on our return from the cruise and what a cake they made plus they'd included candles and matches, which I really appreciated! The swimming pool isn't the biggest but it's up on the roof and there's lovely sunbeds and towels there. All the staff we met were execeptionally polite and friendly. The only two negatives that I would have about the hotel is 1) In the Marina Suite, we were right beside where the Ships docked, so it was possible, if we had the curtains fully opened, to be seen by the ship passengers! and 2) in the rooms, there is no information book on the hotel, so it's quite difficult to know what number to ring for reception/housekeeping etc or where things are located or how they work e.g. how to connect to the internet etc. We only discovered on our last day that numbers for reception etc were located on the inside back of the \"scribble pad\" !

My main criteria that I was looking for in a hotel were (1) proximity to the sea (2) quality hotel (3) proximity to public transportation + the centre of town. After it coming down to the Hotel Del Mar near Barceloneta metro station and this hotel, I chose the Grand Marina as I felt like splurging a little. (I was very pleased with my choice, by the way, as we passed by the Hotel Del Mar and the street it was on was very dirty (although the hotel itself might be nice of course.)) The price to upgrade to a Premier room from a Superior room was only 100 euros for the 4 nights, so I decided to go with that as it guaranteed having a balcony. This also proved to be a good choice, as I saw the inside of a Superior room while passing by and it was a standard, decent-but-not-big size, whereas the Premier room is really spacious with a hallway entrance, walk-in closet and a 2-room bathroom. The only small disappointment size-related to the room was the balcony, it was not small, but I had hoped that it would be larger. We ended up paying $350 per night including a $100 booking fee on one of the sites listed on tripadvisor, which I thought was good value on 1 week notice (the price had increased $100-$150 in the week I had waited to book.) I've uploaded photos of our room and view, but in short we were on the 4th floor (smoking rooms are only on 3rd+4th floors), directly above the entrance facing the port and with good views of the water, the Columbus monument and the centre of town. Definitely lived up to expectations in this regard. The bed was very spacious, I think they call it a queen-size bed on their website but it seemed like it could have been a king. One real perk that they don't advertise is that they have a selection of different types of pillows, hypo-allergenic ones are standard but there are 6 different kinds, all named after famous hollywood actresses. We went to the beach 3 times during our stay, and each time the room was sand-free after it was cleaned, which was a relief. The airconditioning also worked very well. The bathrooms are equiped with 2 sinks, a standing shower as well as a bathtub with water-jet functions, all very modern. High quality toiletries and spa-type bath gels were also included. The breakfast we had on the first day was delivered on time and was absolutely delicious, although pricey enough for us to only order it once. We ended up paying around 40 euros, but we did admittedly splurge a bit. The staff were helpful and courteous, apart from one time at around 3:00AM when we came back and the automatic door was not functioning and was already ajar, so I pushed it open... the male receptionist sternly told me not to touch the door and to use the secondary door, which I had not noticed... I think they should have put up a sign saying \"use other door\" or something. Was too tired to argue with him though. That said, I don't hold this against the hotel at all, it was a very minor incident. Transportation was fantastic and more convenient than I thought it'd be. The walk to the metro was 5 minutes tops, and whats more is there is a taxi stand directly in front of the hotel, with taxis waiting for most of the daytime. Note that Barcelona taxis are rather reasonably priced, we paid 22 euros for a ride to the airport, 8 euros for a ride to the beach, 9 euros for a ride from Catalunya place. All in all, I really had a fantastic time at this hotel, and would recommend it to anyone. THAT SAID: during my research, I had neglected to check out the Pullman Hotel, another 5 star hotel in Barcelona located directly beach-front next to the Hotel Arts. The average rate for this hotel and the Pullman are very similar, but the Pullman's location is so much better. Each are around 5 minutes walking from the metro, from which Catalunya/Gracia stations can be reached in less than 10 minutes, but the key difference is that the Pullman is beach-front, which means you can just \"pop out\" to the beach for a bit, rather than making an actual excursion to the beach as one has to do at the Grand Marina. It is also located next to a series of 5-6 trendy beach front restaurants and lounge clubs, which we spent a fair amount of time at, so we would have saved time and money in staying there probably. Nonetheless, if you don't intend to spend time at the beach, the Grand Marina has a better location as it is just a 5 minute walk from Las Ramblas etc. PS: Bring the address with you just in case, and the hotel name written down, as taxis in Barcelona really don't seem to know where it is off the top of their head.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel - but far from perfect\u201d", "Author": "godfather830", "ReviewID": "UR79675204", "Content": "First of all, let me just point out that even though this may be considered a 5-star hotel in Barcelona, it would only count as a 4 or even a 3.5 star hotel in the United States or Canada.

Other than that, there's just not much luxury in there at all.

It is also situated right next to the bus stops for the Bus Turistic and Barcelona City Tour, whcih are Barcelona's two main tourist buses that take you to all the interesting sites all over the city. Additionally, while other neighborhoods in Barcelona can be intimidating (especially at night), this hotel is in a nice neighborhood and you can feel safe walking the pleasant main street along the coast at all times.

We were met by friendly and efficient staff who after hearing our attempts in Spanish spoke to us in fluent English, but really seemed to appreciate us trying! Our room was a city view room on floor 7, we were rewarded with a stunning panoramic view from our balcony stretching over the port and city. The room was huge with a gorgeous bath and shower room, dressing area and a very comfortable bed, plus a large sofa. The furnishings where sparce but there was nothing that we needed that wasn't there. It felt like coming back to our room was part of the treat of being in Barcelona. We heard a lot about safety in Barcelona, and so were careful but never had any problems. We tended to avoid La Rambla as (in our opinion) by day it was a dreadful, crowded place and had heard plenty about it not being the safest place at night, but the walk round to Rambla de Mar was both safe and picturesque for an evening meal. Admittedly this was not the place to find the \"real\" Spain but suited us well. From a tourists point of view this was perfect - the open top buses stop just outside, most major city centre attractions are close by, and the area of Montjuic is an easy walk. The nearest metro stop is about 5 mins walk away. The kiosk at the end of the road from the hotel was well stocked with reasonably priced water and other refreshements served by a very friendly lady, perfect for the return to the hotel without paying premium prices. A couple of downsides - the pool was much smaller than the photos make it look, and the breakfast was overpriced. A short walk into the city would find you cheaper options. Also, being by the port meant there was noise from the ships coming in. However, I think it is important to remember that this is a city hotel, and complete silence is very hard to find anywhere.

With a view to exploring most of the city on foot we selected the Eurostars Grand Marina due to its good location. It is in the harbour next to the Rambla de Mar (a very tourist-friendly restaurant and shopping complex) and a short walk from La Rambla (one of the main tourist areas in Barcelona). There is also a pharmacy just round the corner, handy for buying bottled water (essential). Due to the location there are large boats and cruise ships in and out of the harbour which can be noisy but it didn't disturb us - in fact we rather enjoyed watching the larger vessels try to manoeuvre out of the harbour. The staff are very friendly and spoke excellent English. We had a standard room which was spacious and had a great view of the sea. The bathroom is luxurious with his/her washbasins, a good shower and a spa-bath. Also handy was the multitude of complimentary toiletries, which even included a shaving kit. We didn't have breakfast included but we tried it once and it was very nice if a little overpriced. Which leads me to the only real negative point. A beer at the poolside bar cost an unbelievable 7 euros. It wasn't even a pint - more like half. As a frame of reference 7 euros will get you a full LITRE of beer in one restaurant on the Rambla de Mar. It was a similar story in the piano bar - a White Russian (cocktail) cost 12 euros (most restaurants around the city offer a full bottle of wine for this price) A coffee (in fact it erroneously turned out to be an espresso) cost 4. Because there were no in-room coffee/tea facilities we walked to Starbucks on the Rambla de Mar for our daily caffeine hit. If I'm being really picky it was a struggle to get a sun lounger up on floor 8 (the otherwise decent pool area). Such a large open space that currently the hotel are failing to use to its full potential. On a more positive note the views of the city and harbour up there are breathtaking. But to linger on these minor issues is to overlook what a friendly, well-located hotel the Grand Marina really is. I would thoroughly recommend it and would return in an instant.

I first want to say thank you to all of the trip advisor reviewers for their entries! I read many different reviews before deciding on this hotel. We wanted an updated, clean hotel, in a safe area, close to the cruise terminal and convenient to sites without breaking the bank - a good value. The previous reviews gave me a good sense of what to expect from this hotel. We encountered much of what was written earlier: Rooms were very nice, clean, and modern. They offered free wireless internet and had 3 computers with a printer in the business center/restaurant area. The bed was hard, but that was ok for me. Hotel staff was VERY cordial, helpful and spoke english. We took a taxi from the cruise terminal (approx 8 euros) and arrived at the hotel at 8:30 am. We were able to check in to one of our rooms right away-Sweet! It was about a 10-15 minute walk to La Ramblas and to the waterfront mall/restaurant area. La Ramblas was more roudy and the waterfront area was more upscale/family orientated. Both are worth a visit. The Taxi from the hotel to the airport was 33 euros for us. The only other advice I have is: If you don't speak Spanish, learn a few key sentences because they seem to only speak Spanish in many of the area shops and restaurants-including Starbucks. If you are from the US and have never traveled to Spain, find out ahead of time if your ATM card will work in Spain and plan accordingly (as I did not). For some reason my bank's ATM card wouldn't work in Spain and we were low on Euros at that point -oops. We had to limit our activities to those establishments that took a credit card. The hop on hop off bus was not one of them unfortunately. Luckily there was plenty to do on foot. We were very sad to be off our cruise ship, but Barcelona and the Eurostar Grand Marina offered us a nice conclusion to a wonderful European vacation.", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Duesseldorf", "Title": "\u201cVery reasonably priced with friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "LiaX", "ReviewID": "UR74487555", "Content": "The hotel is right next to the middle tower of the telef\u00e9rico at the harbour, a few metres from the Columbus statue, so many sights are short walks away.

Whoever rated this a 5 star hotel from the Hotelliers Assoc. needs a kick in the pants. After much research on Trip advisor, we decided to stay here as part of our Honeymoon trip. Unfortunatley, I made this booking sometime ago when their rating was much higher. The recent reviews and they're rapid decline down the trip advisor scale explain why its going all so wrong. The Good - Big spacious room on top floor (upgraded due to honeymoon). - Good selection of toiletries - Extensive Gym - Good location (10min walk to Ramblas) - Great View from top floor. The Bad - The LAZIEST staff I have ever seen in any Hotel. - You have to take your bags to your room (I have no problem with this, but it is a requirement of a 5 star hotel) - The HARDEST bed you will sleep on (Great if u have just had a spinal operation) and the standard pillow is just as hard (luckily you can change pillows) - 'Sauna' is a joke. It is a 2 person cabin in the changeroom. You must contact reception to turn it on. The first time, I did so 3 times and the receptionist insisted it was on and that I must be mistaken. After complaining to the duty manager, they sent a maintainence man up who discovered the control box had a blown fuse. The 3rd day they just forgot. - The hall areas outside the rooms are filthy. The carpets are stained and dirty. - The maid service is poor. Twice we had to get our own towels from the maid trolley in the hallway. - Staff extremely unfriendly. I went downstairs to get the bar to get 2 glasses of ice (so we could have drinks in our room). The barman did not look impressed that I asked...it really was like extracting Teeth. - EXPENSIVE, EXPENSIVE, EXPENSIVE. There are far better options and better value in Barcelona. I know because we tried to check out early. We inspected 3 other hotels which seemed far better - unfortunately for us they were booked out. The Ugly. We were booked for 5 nights, but checked out 1 day early. As mentioned before, we would have checked out on the 1st day had we had found another hotel. Here is the ugly bit. On day 3, I informed the front desk that we will be checking out next day. At no time did the male clerk enquire why we were checking out, just to point out that my booking was for 5 not 4 days. The next morning on checkout we met the 'lovely' Ivanna (I got the name this time). Once she realised that we were checking out early, she stated she could find no record of the computer entry the male made the day before. Then she went on to 'interrogate' me as to whom was this person I spoke with, what was their name etc. I said to her what Tourist has the habit of getting every clerk's name they speak to (I know now - hence why I remember Ivanna). Then the most idiotic thing I have ever heard - she told me that I should have cancelled the last night from the computer in my room not at the desk. I then told her that was the most ridiculous thing I had heard...to not speak directly to the reservation staff if I am staying in the hotel. Just to get the final word, she took great pride in telling me that she would be 'checking this out'. As the hotel had my credit card details (and based on past performance would charge me regardless) I insisted on speaking with the Duty Manager. She informed me that there was no duty Manager on until 9.00 a.m. - A '5 Star' hotel that does not have a duty manager on 24/7 - What a JOKE.

They wanted to fix the door but we declined as we wanted to rest and asked for another room. We got an upgrade to a premier room 530 which was really nice. Comfy wide bed with nice furnishings, 2 chairs to relax in, a balcony overlooking the offices, a seperate jacuzzi bath and massage shower and his and hers sinks. The hotel was quiet on the first night during the early hours but we heard a lot of noise right up until 6am on the following night which disturbed our sleep. It was people coming back drunk to their rooms and being very inconsiderate, never heard any noise from cruise ships etc. Had drinks and a meal in the restaurant on the Friday. Food was ok, nothing special and the drinks were expensive, equivalent to \u00a310.00 for a Malibu and a Diet Coke. Although you expect to pay more in a hotel I thought that was a little pricey. As we were staying for a weekend none of the shops by the offices were open so I would suggest bringing a few bottles of water/soft drinks with you as otherwise you will be spending a fortune in the bar just to have some liquid! We were expecting good things from Barcelona but found a lot of places shut up and wherever we seemed to eat , the staff seemed to find it acceptable to serve us cold lasagne, cold pizza etc, one place we had to walk out off as this happened twice with the same dish. None of the Spanish seemed to encounter the same problem so not sure if it was because we were English? We decided to eat at the Hard Rock Cafe on the Saturday night as being a chain we knew we could be assured of 'warm food'. Whilst waiting at the bar for a free table ( a 2.5 hr wait on a Saturday night, finally seated 11pm) we noticed the barmen were charging what they wanted for peoples drinks. My husband ordered a beer and someone else ordered the same beer from a different barman and was charged an additional 20 cents, not much but it seems they do like to rip off the tourists in this place. A final warning be very wary of pickpockets on Las Ramblas. Before we went to Barcelona we were warned. Whilst looking for an eatery on Friday we noticed a man and a woman following us everywhere we went and when we stopped they stopped. I had my handbag attached to the front of my body and my husband had his wallet in his front pocket. When we stopped and looked at them , they said ' Assistance?' and we walked away quickly in the opposite very lit direction. This question is noted in our guide book as to what they ask if they think they are rumbled. Did not feel very safe in the city after that experience and that was 2 hrs into our trip.

I was disappointed there were no tea/ coffee making facilities in the room as I am partial to a brew when I wake in the morning and made a suggestion on their feedback form. Internet access was free which was a bonus as quite a lot of hotels here in the UK charge for this service. The restaurant and bar services were expensive. We had a last night drink in the bar and for 1 pint of beer and 1 vodka and coke we were charged 18 Euros. The hotel's position was also a plus for us as we wanted to stay fairly close to The Rambla and this was about a 10 min walk if that. If you like shopping it was very close to the marina shopping centre. Views from the hotel were good especially if you like cruise liners. The hotel had a pool on the 8th floor which was small but there was also a hot tub in the gym area. The sunbathing area was ok but sadly lacking in sun beds in the evening as most people seemed to sight see during the day and chill by the pool early evening.

I had read a couple of reviews about Eurostar Grand Marina, and decided that everything looked consistent with their own website and so would not be in for any bad surprises. On arrival, check-in was very speedy, and on entering our room, the panoramic views of the sea port was the first thing I saw.....I was gobsmacked....as it was absolutely breathtaking. Three sides of the hotel are surrounded by water so I\u2019m guessing that all rooms are subject to similarly stunning views. Located in the Port Vell area and just a 10 minute stroll from the beginning of La Rambla (add another 10mins to get to Merccat de la Boqueria- food market, and another 5-10 to get the Cathedral). This hotel is definately well balanced to meet the needs of both business travellers and holidayers, as it was located right next door to the World Trade Centre Barcelona, though also situated within easy walking distance to all the action. The room was spacious with the d\u00e9cor being tastefully understated, whilst still maintaining 5* sophistication. Food and drink were quite pricey, though little touches made it seem worth it e.g. live piano music in the bar & lounge, complimentary Japanese cracker bites with cocktails etc. The gymnasium was well equipped and very modern, with an indoor hot-tub, sun loungers, and small outdoor pool in the same area. The staff were extremely helpful, with an impeccable level of service being delivered by all! They would always go the extra mile to ensure that nothing less than a 5* service was being delivered. It was my birthday on the last day and Chris from room serive added so many extra touches to our usually in-room spread overlooking the sea including chocolate dipped strawberries served on a black slate tile. There was a taxi rank directly outside the hotel doors, ordinary bus stops 1 min away, and open-top guided tour buses that stopped literally 2 minutes from the hotel. The guided open-topped tour buses offered transportation to all parts of Barcelona- North , South, East & West (blue, red, & green routes) with stops at all of the sight-seeing hot spots directly en-route. I would highly recommend this as it ensured that a greater area of Barcelona could be covered between visiting the tourist destinations of your choice. It cost approx \u20ac20 per person for 1 full days unlimited use of all 3 routes; hopping on and off as and when. We took it to get to many places including: - Parc G\u00fcell, La Sagrada Familia, Casa Batllo to name but a few.

If you are looking for European Old World elegance, this is not for you. If you are looking for a modern, clean, better hotel, that is on the water, close to La Rambla, this hotel is for you. At $176 US, Priceline awarded us with a stay at a comfortable hotel. Arriving on Saturday evening after a full day of traveling, and a layover in Madrid, we pleasantly greeted at the reception desk and given a very nice room overlooking a not so nice office building. We were offered complimentary glasses of Cava in the lounge. Being it was Saturday, we were lucky to see that the lounge featured Opera night, which showcased four very good performers. We ordered some tapas, an additional drink and called it a night. The prices were in line with what you would expect at a better hotel. Not outrageous by any means. The room was nice, bathroom had a jacuzzi, but the bed was a little hard. With all better hotels now offering plush bedding, we were surprised. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to the top of La Rambla. We are walkers and found we were able to walk to many of the areas most tourists would want to see. La Boqueria a short walk on La Rambla is great way to start your day and load up snacks for the day ahead. The On and Off Tour Bus stops by the hotel. I suggest if you are staying a few days, to get the 2-day pass. It will take you to the places that are too far to walk to. Now for the best part of the hotel...Felipe, the concierge. Felipe was like a local tour guide for us. He advised where to go, where to eat, and how long to spend at each site. He even advised us where to rest, take out our snacks we bought earlier, and just take in life. Felipe made sure to ask us, on our return from sightseeing, how our day went. If a 5 star hotel is based on services, Felipe might be the reason (maybe the only reason) this is a 5 star hotel.

It's in the Barri Gothic which is lovely to walk around and to shop in. It's got a lot more expensive since our last visit two years ago. We ate Sushi in a restaurant near the hotel on Av. Parallel. It was tasty though the restaurant was only ok decor wise and the area is not great - we didn't feel 100% safe walking up there. The hotel recommended Little Italy restaurant with live Jazz music in the Born district but it wasn't great for food. That area is lovely however for bars and a stroll. Citrus on Pg. de Gracia is lovely but indoors. There are lovely tapas bars on that street where you can sit out and people watch and enjoy the great food at reasonable prices. The Vila Olympica is worth a visit. Hotel des Arts is worth a visit for a cocktail (\u20ac18). Enjoy the decor and view. Nearby on the beach is great for night life. On Maritim Barceloneta there are restaurants which convert to night clubs about midnight; Opium with it's white leather couches was lovely but a lot quieter and more expensive (\u20ac15 per drink) than Shoko which was really busy and had good music.

We arrived about 5pm with a swift check-in followed by Champagne in the room which we requested upon arrival and was called for by reception when we were in the lobby thus it was clearly fast to be in there so quickly with an array of belgian chocolates. After looking around the bathroom, (bath with jets, wonderful aromatic power shower, his and hers sinks, toilet and beday, also lovely gifts and toiletries with robes and slippers) and the room which was very large including a desk, two armchairs and a table, balcony and seperate dressing room - we sat and enjoyed the freshly chilled champs! Having unpacked (a little) we ordered room service for dinner being tired after travelling all day. It was delivered promptly, well presented and hot. For the duration of the stay we used all of the hotels amenities including the pool (which is admittedly small but heated with salt water and very plesant, this is not a thomson holiday resort after all), jacuzzi (which is inside but surrounded by glass casing so views are around), sunbathing area (lovely), roof bar (drinks wonderful and quickly served), restuarant (aire de la mare which is the high cuisine restaurant - absolutely wonderful!!! food is amazing, as is service and wine list!), lobby bar and terrace for lunch, concierge (excellent) amongst others. I really can never understand the quarrelsome approach some take to the Grand Marina! If you want a family hotel where children run and scream and decadence is not your thing try a package holiday! The hotel was excellent, smartly presented, well managed and excellently staffed. I would never hesitate to return and can thoroughly reccommend it to all! If decadence, luxury and real enjoyment is what you are looking for - this is your hotel. Oh and most importantly!

When we complained the manager said there was nothing they could do. We asked if the party was going to go on late and keep us awake that night and he responded by saying he did not know. So we went out that night and returned at one am assuming that the party would be finished or at least quiet by then this was not the case with a band playing right beneath our window all night until three am! When my girlfriend called reception and the duty manager to ask for us to be moved the manager hung up the phone on her! That has never ever happened in my life! You may think this is just a one off bad experience but it wasn't there were several other instances of not just bad but appalling service even by three star standards. We went to the concierge one day and asked for a dinner reservation he insisted that we take a taxi to this beautiful romantic restaurant he knew of we asked if it was close he said yes five minutes. Forty five minutes later and 40 Euros worse off we were dropped off at a Cafe with plastic tables and a load of Dutch tourists from a cruise ship! Not what we expected when we asked for a high class romantic restaurant in Barcelona! Don't stay at this hotel there are so many better hotels with better facilities and location and most of all staff with brains and some decent training.

I was in Barcelona for a large conference and I was eagerly looking forward to a stay in this 5 Star \"GRAND LUXE\" property. I had stayed there for a couple of days back when it was brand new and it was pretty nice then. Boy was I disappointed! The prices had shot up to absolutely unconscionable levels and the property is now showing its age with shabby dings and dents on the furniture, nasty muddy stains on beige bedroom carpets etc. This is definitely not a 5 star \"grand luxe\" property in any way, shape or form. It's \"facilities\" are a generic, trendy restaurant and a lobby. No spa, no amazing pool, no choice of bars. In short, a generic, modern 4 star business hotel. If you compare this to even a 4 star hotel in say, Singapore or Hong Kong, you will come away shaking your head in disbelief. If the blah facilities were the only issue, I would have ranked this place a \"neutral/average\" --after all I have stayed in FAR worse in Europe but it was in the area of the absolutely uncaring and snotty service that I think moved it's rating one step above \"terrible\". The heating was turned on full blast at night, for example, and when I complained that I needed some cooling in my room, the lady at the \"service desk\" said that I should just open the window.... OK... except that there was a 110 decible Telecom Rock Extravaganza put on by some company in the courtyward ! I just sweltered until 1AM when the rock music finally stopped blaring. The next night, I had to put up with hammers and machine tools being used to take apart the rock stage from midnight to 2AM. The management took a \"who cares, this situation can't be helped\" attitude! While this is understandable for an IBIS or MOTEL 6 type place, it is ludicrous treatment when one has paid EUR 900 / night (they jack up the rates during the GSM conference). I don't know about you but at this kind of price, I expect very courteous and responsive treatment, not some kind of insulting \"manana maybe\" shrugging. I don't care if there's a conference going on: if you can't take feed your guests even tuna, don't charge them caviar prices! The Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel, I am afraid, is a bit of a dud.

I normally write off bad reviews I read as whinging hard to please pedants, but this is written in the hope that it is helpful information for anyone seeking to book a quality hotel in Barcelona. I booked a late long weekend break at the end of January and booked two rooms for 3 nights at the Grand Marina. There were actually 5 of us staying including my 3 children (youngest is 9), but the website - similar to most - couldn't cope with booking a family of 5. I therefore called the hotel after booking and explained that there was an additional child and I was happy to pay the extra charge involved. I would have booked direct with the hotel but their website does not feature their telephone number (!) and would not accept an e-mail. When we arrived late on Friday our rooms were not interconnecting, even though the hotel was almost empty and interconnecting rooms must have been available. On the Saturday I decided to check exactly how much they were adding onto the Bill for my 'extra' child so I had no nasty surprises at checkout. It worked out twice what I was paying as an adult. I queried this and the Duty Manager agreed to a small reduction, but still I was paying more for an extra 'Z Bed' stuck in one of our rooms than for my own stay. This hotel definitely does not want kids. It's a business travellers hotel, as witnessed by the bizarrely expensive minibar prices only to be tolerated if on expenses. Please don't think I'm stingy - I don't mind paying for quality - but this is a 3 to 4 star hotel masquerading as 5 star because the building looks good. The pool was closed, the view was of cargo ships being unloaded (which continued noisily overnight) rather than the sea and the staff at reception were less helpful than a famous Torquay guest house. On checkout I asked whether they could advise what times the buses left for Gerona airport as my flight was at 10.30pm. I was made to feel like I was being a nuisance and was told that the last flight from that airport was 8.30pm so I should get a bus around 6.00pm. I checked my ticket and the flight was later as I thought, so we carried on without their uninformed guesswork. Comapre this to the last time I stayed in Barcelona, at the Neri Hotel (4 star not 5) where the staff printed out a bus timetable from the internet for me and could not have been more helpful. It was an appropriate end to a generally poor hotel experience. Thankfully Barcelona itself more than made up for the over-priced and under-delivering Grand Marina. My daughter did have her bag stolen in the city, but at least the thieves involved in that instance don't call themselves 5 star. If you're planning to stay in Barcelona, take it from me, there are much better 4 star hotels than the Grand Marina at around the same price or less - I'm only sorry we didn't stay in one.", "Date": "February 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "liverpool", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "Fazzaitken", "ReviewID": "UR12494914", "Content": "A really gorgeous hotel.

Our summer break this year consisted of a number of short european destination breaks all strung together. We began in Amsterdam for 3 days - moved on to Milan/Lake Garda for 4 days - Barcelona for 4 days and finished off in Dublin for 3 days. Amsterdam was primarily an excuse to see Genesis - great concert incidently - we stayed at the ACH Leidse Square Hotel - a 3 star hotel - reasonable daily rate at about \u00a385 per night - room was small but I've read other reports about this hotel were guests say their room was large - our room was fine for us - it was what we were expecting. Lake Garda was to die for - we stayed in the Hotel Continental, Sirmione - a 4 star hotel - we were upgraded to a junior suite - daily rate approx \u00a3131 - every thing about this hotel was just perfect - location could not be bettered - beautiful views - our own sun terrace situated right on the edge of the lake and a lovely pool - the grounds were maintained immaculately and all the staff were frindly and helpful. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to all trip advisors - I will return to this hotel and this is very unusual for me as my normal stance is that there are so many locations in the world to visit that I can't afford to visit the same place twice - for Sirmione and The Continental Hotel I will make an exception. You can imagine our building expectation when moving on from Sirmione to Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel in Barcelona - this was a 5 star hotel and the most expensive of the 4 hotels we were to stay in - approx daily rate \u00a3154. However, expectation was not to be matched by what we actually received. The hotel is advertised as a 'luxury hotel' and I'm sure there are some rooms that fall into that category but our rooms were the cheapest available in the hotel and as such tend to be the rooms do not warrant the tag 'luxury'. We were given a room that was smaller than our 3 star hotel in Amstedam - there was only one chair in the room - the second person in the room would either have to sit on the bed or use the desk chair - walls were very badly marked - floors were very badly scratched - these were the only rooms in the hotel that did not have a balcony and the view was off the boat terminal roof - we were so disappointed - we did complain and to be fair they did move us immediately to a bigger room with a balcony (I'm not sure whether this was an upgrade or just a better room within our grade of room - I expect it was an upgrade). Unfortunately the spa bath didn't work in this room - I asked reception everyday for 3 days if they could fix it with no success - the day before we were due to leave the maintencance engineer visited whilst we were out to try and fix the problem - unfortunately without success - how did we know that the maintenance engineer had paid us a visit? - he had forgetten to put the the bath panel back. I hate complaning, it is not something that i want to spend my holiday doing - however I was so disappointed I did speak to the reception staff - I managed to negotiate the waiving of our roomservice charge (\u20ac30 - well better than nothing) - but the point is that you go on hoilday to relax not complain and argue with the very people that you hope are going to help you unwind. The common areas of the hotel were delightful although I thought the restaurant had all the charm and ambiance of a large staff canteen. Swimming pool was very small and probably best left to the serial sunbathers. We left the Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel feling short changed - would definately not return. It rained in Dublin and it rained. We booked the Stay Dublin Apartments to try and economise after Barcelona - mind you they were still approx - \u00a3115 per night - I think these apartments are aimed at the many hen and stag night groups - where several dozen can share a few apartments - it was expensive for just the two of us - I think in my student days I would have enjoyed the Apartments - unfortunately those days are long gone.", "Date": "July 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "glasgow", "Title": "\u201cGrand\u201d", "Author": "faithscott", "ReviewID": "UR8118926", "Content": "My partner and i stayed in the hotel over the christmas period of 2006.

In fact, the Bus Turistic stop is just right outside the hotel entrance. FOOD Barcelona has so many great restaurants that I never ate at the hotel. As such, I have no comment on this subject. SERVICE The service is not bad at all. But to be honest, for a 5 star establishment, the service could be pushed to an even higher standard. Many times I would ask the concierge to help with my dinner reservations. And many times they were not able to help me because they could not find the phone number on the internet or because they could not get through to the restaurant.

Barcelona is a city close to my heart. My family are half English and half Spanish and the Spanish side live in and around Barcelona. Therefore it is a city I know very well and have seen both the good and the bad. The hotel Gran Marina definitely gets a mention in the good box. Its first positive feature is its location. Those who do not know Barcelona might very well think, looking at a map, that the hotel lies a little out of the action; but they would be wrong. The hotel is no more than a 5-10 minute (very pleasant) stroll from the beginning of Ramblas. Having stayed in many hotels I can say hand on heart that I enjoy approaching the city from the direction of the sea in the morning considerably more than walking out of my hotel directly into the throng. The hotel itself is unashamedly modern, albeit not minimalist. The reception desk gives a misleading impression of what lies beyond and is probably the most minamalist area in the hotel. It is expansive, quite cold and not particularly welcoming. On reflection it is probably the hotel's least well thought-out and therefore least endering feature. The staff, however, have always amply made up for this. Multilingual, helpful and charming I have never had cause for complaint on any of my stays. In fact, they have often gone out of their way if there has been a problem. The rooms are quite varied, but as a rule of thumb there are two things I would always advise. Firstly, ask fo a room which faces onto the rear courtyard. Whilst it is tempting to think that rooms at the front of the hotel look out to the city you can actually see very little bar the approach road that links the shore to the island upon which the hotel is built. The rooms to the rear have two advantages. Firstly they tend to be quieter, secondly many of the deluxe rooms have balconies looking into the courtyard. That leads me to my second tip; go for at least a deluxe room but never a suite. The deluxe rooms are worth the extra money, the suites are nothing more than two junior suites connected by interconnecting doors (and, unless there's four of you or you've had a falling out with your billionaire wife, what's the point of that?). The pool area at the top of the hotel gives excellent views over the sea, harbour and the city. Whilst the pool is small (but I don't think any smaller than many hotels in its class - ie the Claris) the roof area generally has a lovely feel to it. I think this is to do with the fact that you are sufficiently removed from the city to have a degree of tranquility and the fact that there is water all around. In the evening it does not, however, have the charm or the romance of the Claris roof terrace. On the first floor, however, there is a bar in an interior courtyard accessed by a bridge over a shallow pool that is, whilst no more than a modernist box, quite charming. Even so, I would not advise a romantic evening here; possibly just a cocktail before hitting the city. I have never eaten in the restaurant, but then again why would you? Barcelona has a fantastic array of restaurants for all budgets and the Barcelonetta, which has some truly outstanding seafood/fish restaurants, is a only a short stroll along the harbour. I never understand any criticism of any hotel in Barcelona on the basis of its breakfast, lunch, dinner or lack thereof unless it is so far removed from the city as to make a short stroll to a cafe/bar/restaurant impossible. In short, this is a great hotel for those wanting to sample the delights of Barcleona in the comfort of a modern, but by no means soulless hotel.", "Date": "April 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bournemouth, England", "Title": "\u201cServed its purpose really well\u201d", "Author": "UKtraveller143", "ReviewID": "UR7292111", "Content": "Stayed for three nights in early April 2007 in a Premier room overlooking the City, so a superb view from the small balcony.

Our room was beautiful and extremely large, the bathroom in particular was a treat with walk-in shower and a separate bath with jacuzzi. The hotel itself is very modern and I suppose could be described (as it has been) as being primarily a business hotel, however, I feel it is more than that. One benefit of being out of the main tourist hotel area is the fact that you get a peaceful nights sleep yet it's only a 5/10 minute walk from the end of Las Ramblas. The breakfasts were nice with everything you could really want and to suit all nationalities, the service was excellent. We loved Barcelona and had a great time experiencing most of the attractions, my favourite thing though had to be wandering through the narrow little streets of the Barri Gotic and in particular enjoying a tapas lunch in one of the leafy squares with the sound of chiming church bells in the background - wonderful. Check-out at the hotel was speedy and efficient. However, the return journey marked the only negative of our whole trip. We travelled with Monarch Scheduled and experienced a 9 hour delay which meant spending almost the entire night in a hot airport with no information or advice with regard to compensation (apparantly due to recent EU Legislation you are entitled to a refund on your ticket if delayed over 5 hours, overnight accommodation and two free phone calls home - none of which Monarch disclosed - obviously) - we are currently making a claim but nevertheless would avoid Monarch again in the future especially as we have since learnt they are renowned for long delays. Despite the above, we had a fabulous time and would strongly recommend this hotel and indeed vibrant Barcelona for a break.", "Date": "August 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vantaa, Finland", "Title": "\u201cGrand Marina - the best so far\u201d", "Author": "Mucha", "ReviewID": "UR5525966", "Content": "I stayed at the Grand Marina with my husband who was there for business for a couple of days.

We travel a lot but don't usually spend as much as this on a hotel (170 Euro a night, room only). But it turned out to be an excellent choice, and worth the money. I booked direct with the hotel, selecting the cheapest type of room. What we got was excellent, a room on the 7th floor, at the front of the hotel with superb views over the city and harbour. You could see the bottom of La Rambla (5 minutes walk away), and in the distance the Sagrada Familia was visible. I think we got lucky here, because I would have expected the lowest priced rooms to be facing the offices/courtyard at the back. The hotel did seem quiet, maybe that's why. The room was very comfortable, and nicely designed and decorated. Very peaceful too, and you could even slide a partition to shut off the doorway/bathroom area. No noise from outside, apart from the rumbling of the engines of cruise ships and ferries that would come and go. The room has a safe, and the TV had the BBC News and Sky News channels in English. Bathroom was huge and well stocked with toiletries, not to mention dressing gowns and slippers. The bath took a long time to fill, but the optional jacuzzi jets made it worth the wait. On arrival we got a voucher for a glass of cava at the hotel bar, very modern and spacious. Luckily the voucher actually allowed us a free glass each (and a bowl of poppadom snacks) because it would have been very expensive to buy anything there. And as for the minibar, just don't go there. We bought bottles of water while out exploring. We also didn't think it was worth paying \u00a315 each for breakfast. Looked very nice, but there are a few cafes just behind the hotel. The staff were very friendly, helpful and efficient. They also speak great English, unlike the locals you encounter in shops, restaurants, taxis etc. English tends to be their 3rd or 4th language, but it was never a real problem. Out and about, the tourist bus is a good way of seeing the city, but it is slow and crowded. If you know exactly where you want to go, use the excellent Metro.

Also Mini bar 5 euros for a can of coke, suggest buy from many supermarkets just off las ramblas for less than 1 eruo.

I got a good deal over the holiday period - surprisingly better than all the online hotel finders, by going directly to the hotel itself. We did book it in July but it was a good lesson in that all the \"cheapest deals\" offers are not always the cheapest. Closer to the holiday I ordered some flowers for the room as a present for my wife and even though the hotel already had my credit card details as part of the booking process, they wanted payment up front and I had to mail photocopies of my passport and credit card. I was unhappy at this risky exercise and it certainly was not what I expected from a 5 star hotel. I also wanted to reserve a table for New Year's Eve and this also was subject to the send payment up front process. We arrived to a friendly welcome and a very comfortable King Premier room, which I had requested at the front of the hotel so that there was a view of the city and waterfront. The rear of the hotel faces into a large inner square, bounded by office buildings and does not have any views. Breakfast was good at a fixed 15 euros for a help yourself comprehensive buffet but if you only wanted a coffee and a croissant, it was still 15 euros. We ate most breakfasts by having a short walk to the Ramblas and trying the different bars and restaurants there. The hotel is on a large arm that projects into the port area and it is a very busy ferry terminal as well as cruise ships port - presumably many cruises in the summer. This did cause some continuous noise during the evening and early morning. There was also a disco in the base of one of the nearby buildings which was noisy as people exited in the early hours at weekends (and summer ?). Both of these noise problems would probably be solved by an \"inner\" room but sacrificing the views - you pays your money and takes your choice. Room was very comfortable, complementary cava and chocolate strawberries on arrival (absolutely recommended) and there were fresh sheets put on the enormous bed every day by a very efficient maid service. A relaxing and very friendly bar lounge and a roof top area that would be great in summer - just a little cool in the December sunshine. The door staff also worked hard and responded to quips and jokes. Reception and Concierge were overall friendly but not very efficient. We tried to book for Christmas Lunch and were told that there wasn't a table available, then there was, then one concierge team did not pass on our booking for 2 days to reserve a table. When Christmas lunch came, a very well prepared 4 course meal, there were only 4 tables in the whole restaurant occupied - you don't expect to be given this sort of run around in a 5 star hotel ! Concierge had advised us that there were some areas in the city that needed to be avoided and that very late at night we should phone Reception, who would send a taxi for us. We went to Christmas Eve midnight mass in the old Cathedral and on exiting after 1am we phoned for a taxi. The response was \" very busy, not many taxis, you'll have to walk, I can't help you\" !!! I would be dismayed if a 3 star hotel staff member told me he couldn't help me but when a 5 star hotel Reception member tells you that, then I question their commitment to guest service. We walked home and did arrive safely but it was the low point of the stay. Because we were staying for a 3 week period the hotel requested me to settle an interim bill half way through, something that puzzled me as I had given them my credit card detils back in July (and had posted them with my passport details). Anyway I paid it but found on my return home that they had debited the amount twice on the same day and even though they refunded it a few days later, it had sent my bank account into the red and I had to pay bank charges on it - so much for 5 star efficiency ! Overall - yes we enjoyed the stay despite the hotel's failings and I think this was made up for by the atmosphere in Barcelona. It was buzzing in December, so goodness knows what its like in the height of summer. We had read about the \"iffy\" areas and the scam merchants but our impression was that the city takes it's tourism seriously, there were always police about (not in an unnerving way) and the streets were always clean ( we saw street sweepers cleaning up at 1-30am on Christmas morning !) They are making big efforts to further \"clean up\" the old areas and overall we felt safe and relaxed, even on the metro - which is a fabulous system, as indeed is all the transport set up. Just be aware it is a big tourist city and keep your wits about you - don't flaunt money or cameras, etc.. The Barcelona people are a strange breed. We came across waiters who were unfriendly to the point of hostility but if you just accept this as some city quirk and let it go over your head, then its quite fun to be really friendly to someone who is having a permanently bad day, every day. The friendliest waiters and bar staff are the ones from out of town!

The bath was luxurious and the plush bathrobes and slippers were a nice touch. We received delicious chocolates in our room on arrival and coupons for free glasses of cava from the hotel bar. The hotel was significantly, $100+ per night, less expensive than other comparable hotels. And some of the others, like Hotel Arts, are not walking distance to many sites. The hotel does try to make the money up in the prices charged for food, telephone calls or Internet usage, but we tended to try to avoid those charges. We generally had an inexpensive, but good, breakfast in one of the cafeterias surrounding the hotel and the WTC office buildings. However, Sundays they are closed and ordering two coffees brought to the room was like $15 and not big coffees either. The phone call prices were also ridiculous. I would recommend using the phones at the Internet cafes for both local and long distance. My biggest complaint was that there is no answering machine on the room phones, so it was very difficult to receive messages. When a call comes in, the hotel forwards the call to the room, letting it ring. If there is no answer, the caller must call back and ask to leave a message and then someone will bring a written message up to the room. Kind of like the Pony Express days. The front desk staff, doormen and bellmen are very professional and courteous. Room service was laser fast. The concierge is on the second floor, not at lobby level, which I found a little odd. The location is excellent. It is an easy (less than fifteen minutes) walk to Las Ramblas, Maremagnum, Barceloneta or The Born. The tourist bus and the funicular also stop right in front of the hotel. Note that the hotel was very quiet when we were there and it is a little dark walking back late at night. Although we didn't feel unsafe, it is perhaps better to take a taxi.

PROS: - The front desk staff was courteous and efficient (and fluent in English). - Our room, a Superior king, was huge, beautifully decorated, and immaculate. - The multi-head power shower was a special treat for Americans in Europe (as we usually have trouble finding a good shower in even the best hotel!). - The breakfast buffet, at USD 24/person, was well worth the cost: it included everything from kumquats to silver dollar pancakes to scrumptious pastries and homemade breads. Champagne and strawberries were also available. Waitstaff was extremely courteous and attentive with refills of some of the best coffee I've tasted. - Transportation is plentiful. The Bus Turistic (a tour bus that takes you all over the city) stops right in front of the hotel, and cabs/hire cars were always waiting.

The Hilton doesn't come close to the service we received at the Grand Marina and hotels in the UK could learn alot by seeing how they treat their guests here. One tip I would offer is prior to your arrival contact the hotel and request a room overlooking the harbour. We stayed in room 608 which had such a beautiful view you didn't want to leave the room!

However, if I were to note a complaint, it would be the stained, smelly carpet on floor 4, obviously from a leak of some sort, but still unpleasant. Also, the lobby is a bit concrete and bare, giving a false impression of the high standards throughout the hotel. The tourist bus stops just outside and the cable cars to Montjuic and Barceloneta give a fabulous view.

We stayed on the weekend when the normally extremely expensive room rates of the weekday business, drop dramatically. I was happily surprised by the convenience of the location which was almost directly at the bottom of La Rambla,(La Rambla was good for live entertainment, but not much shopping - a bit run down actually)but there is a convenient subway station there,and the hotel is slap bang in the middle of the sleek modern Marina area. To my mind the location was very convenient but much less claustraphobic than the Gothic area where we saw many cramped over priced older hotels were located. Despite the fact I had booked fairly last minute for Barcelona's major festival weekend (The Merce Festival) the hotel was not overcrowded! Throughout our stay we recieved truely excellent service.I had requested by email a room with a sea veiw,and on requesting this again at checkin we were upgraded to a larger room on the top floor of the hotel with a panoramic veiw of the Marina and city!(Fortunate because a quick walk around the hotel building quickly showed us that any room facing in towards the central courtyard would have no veiw but the other hotel rooms instead of the magnificent Marina!) Our room was on the top floor-same floor as the pool, which was surprisingly small. However I still enjoyed it, as at that time of year we had it to ourselves. Also, the veiw of the cruise ships and castle made me feel like a million dollars, as did the soak in the gym jacuzzi after. Oh, and then I soaked in the spa bath in our room-wonderful! The shower was not quite as good due to a slight lack of water pressure, but otherwise the bathroom was roomy and elegant with plenty of bath goodies to use. Since I had also mentioned our stay was for our aniversary when I had booked at the hotel website,at check in we were also told that a complimentary bottle of Cava(sparkling white wine) and chocolate covered strawberries were on their way. I had not even directly requested this! We also received vouchers for arrival free drinks at the bar- (more cava), but the bar waitress graciously swapped this for 2 very generous gin and tonics, no problems! Not surprisingly, by the time we set out on the town for all the festival events we were very happy!! Barcelona during this festival was absolutely wonderful-it had a happy family feeling and despite my fear of muggers etc we didn't see any unsavoury groups targeting tourists- but later we did hear of one person having their bag taken when they read their tourist guide. However, we had an amazing and fun time. My conclusions, the hotel is well located for subway(in La Rambla), tourist buses- and even cable car to hills behind the city(both outside the front door)andalso for walking around the Marina.(Taxis in Barcelona are also cheap). Excellent service if you book on the hotel website so you can make any requests, tell them about your special occasion and then check in early on a weekend to possibly get a room upgrade!

Very few sunbeds ~ which are uncomfortable and we could only see three matresses for about twenty sunbeds, no umbrellas, no tables and finding a waiter was impossible. Furthermore when we were there it was breezy and unpleasant. The problem with the pool is compounded by the hotels location, its a good twenty minutes walk to the beach, so if you want to lay in the sun go somewhere else. We've also stayed at the Hotel Arts and thought that the Grand Marina is the better of the two although the Arts pool is fractionally better and at least the beach is only 20 metres away.

The view from the room overlooked the courtyard of the World Trade Centre. When we first arrived we were shown the marina room which I did not think was as nice as the Junior Suite and at an extra 150euros a night for the marina suite I couldnt see the value and we took the Junior Suite. The marina suites are to the sides of the building so you can see the water but beware if you are on a lower floor as cruise ships berth along side the hotel and the marina suite we saw had the view obsured by a german cruise ship blaring techno music. The hotel itself caters entirely for business clients so if you are staying at this hotel as a tourist do not expect much in the way of service. The lobby looks like an office building lobby and the desk staff are not helpful. The hotel facilities are basicly non-existant. The rooftop pool is very very small and very cold. The deckchairs are scattered around one little section of the roof and it is not very relaxing. We sat up there to get some sun but the pool appears to be an afterthought on the part of the hotel. There is no service at all on the roof. You cannot get a drink, anything to eat or even find anyone to ask. The rest of the roof, which is a large area, is taken up by chairs and tables and an always closed cafe. This is obviously only used for functions - again catering only for business clients. Room service was good, the food was acceptable but not amazing. The restaurant was never open as far as we saw, you can get something to eat in the bar area but this is just the room service menu with much less options. Do not plan to hang out in the bar for some fun, it is always empty and boring. So to sum up this hotel I would recommend it for anyone who wants a great room but doesnt plan on hanging around the hotel too much. If you want a base to discover Barcelona then this hotel is good simply because of the standard of room. It is not however a hotel I would recommend if you are looking for service or to relax at.

Top 5 positives 1) Location.. right at the end of La Rambla. Good access to restaurants, and attractions such as the cable car outside the main door, the port area etc. Easy to get to. Metro about 10 minute walk. City tour bus from outside the hotel. Taxis sitting waiting outside nearly all the time. Also just a little removed from the streets, so no midnight sirens etc. 2) The Rooms. We had a fabulous room, overlooking the city. It was a cut above the standard room, with a walk in dressing room, but one of the best rooms I have stayed in, with walk in shower, double doors to ensure a peaceful nights rest. The only sounds we heard were that of the cruise ships which park next door! The hotel was full and honestly my wife and I did not hear a sound from the corridors or next door. Room also had jet bath and excellent shower with marble finish. 3) Breakfast. Excellent spread of all types of food. Our breakfast was included in our package. At \u20ac30 a head for pay as you go, you might find it is worth looking at an all in package! 4) The view. Ask for a room in the front of the hotel. At the rear you look over an office block. Fabulous views of the city, cable car, port area, right the way up to some of the famous churches. We could see the Gaudi Cathedral from our room. 5) Service. It is a five star hotel, so the service you get is commencerate, and good, from room service, to door staff, to check in. Top 3 negatives - and this is being pickey! 1) The prices. At \u20ac5 for a cup of tea in the bar you get the picture of what the rest of the prices are like! 2) The atmosphere. This is certainly a big business hotel, with many conferences on during our stay. You do not go there for the atmosphere in the bar at night, (we were the only people in it on Saturday evening at about 10.30) 3) Why do all the staff have ear pieces and microphones on their jackets? I am sure it improves the service offered, but it also gives the impression of big brother watching you and some high security facility, instead of a homely friendly atmosphere.

Unfortunately - we got twin beds but as the beds were next to each other anyway, it wasn't really a problem. First impressions Arrived at the airport and our taxi driver had no idea where we were staying and after asking various colleagues, eventually got us there. Personally, we just think he was a bit mad and was trying to keep the meter ticking to get more euros from us - until we asked him to re-set it! On arrival, the doormen were really lovely and check in was friendly and efficient. Room The room was a great size, overlooked the front, and although we were bang in the middle facing the cable car tower, the view was still spectacular. We saw cruise ships come and go too! Room was really modern, fab bathroom with seperate walk in part of a shower/toilet/bidet and two sinks and a whirlpool bath that could even fit two of you in! The mini bar was really expensive so just bought water from the supermarket; the beds were really comfy and if you rang housekeeping they brought you up extra pillows (of your liking) free of charge - you had a menu to choose them from!! Hotel Overall, a really great place to stay. The bar (1st floor) was really nice and laid back - 11 euros for a white wine and bottle of local lager so not exactly cheap but we paid more for drinks in Port Olympic! The location is right on the marina so is about a 5-10 minute walk to the bottom of the Ramblas but we actually liked this as it was nice to walk out of the hustle and bustle (last thing at night) to the serenity of your quiet hotel room. The Touristic Bus Line (blue line) picks up right outside the hotel (World Trade Centre stop) so that was great in getting about and would reccommend this service to anyone - 2 days is 22 euros each (pay on the bus) and you can get on and off both the blue and red lines as many times as you like and it takes you all around Barcelona. (The guy on the information point on the 1st floor was really helpful with all this info so go and see them for advice etc) Overall - just a really modern, luxorious hotel with friendly staff. Would definitely reccomend it if you are wanting a quiet, comfortable, relaxing hotel where you can get a good nights sleep in comfortable surroundings. Not for you though if you wanting to stay in a traditional spanish hotel, amongst the hustle and bustle, maybe then look at hotels in Pacia de Gracia as this we felt was the next best place to stay...

The location of the hotel is great, cannot be faulted. However when you see the pictures of the hotel you think, well I did anyway, that the majority of the \"circular building\" was the hotel. In fact only the front part facing the city is the hotel the rest are office buildings ! The service in the hotel is second to none, they really treat you well. I went for a Premier Room at 250 Euro per night. It was a great room with a great view of the city and the bottom corner of the port. If you go for a standard room as some of the people I got talking to did, the view was into a person office. The whole back of the hotel looks into offices. There is a cable car station outside the hotel that is about 15 stories high that blocks the view of the city if you are unlucky to get a front room in the middle. The floors in the room are wooden and look nice BUT with a wooden floor comes the noise. You can hear people walking on the floors in the adjoining rooms and upstairs which can be damn annoying. Also the walls are very thin so you can hear people talking and doing \"other\" things very clearly which can be infuriating when you're trying to have a lie in. That was disapointing for us. The hotel is expensive for mini bar, a water was about 5 euro and a mars bar over 5 euro ! There is no iron in the room and we had to get a few shirts and blouses pressed. They charge about 10 euro a shirt but you do get them back within a few hours.....bring a travel iron ! Even with the bad points the location of the hotel and the service are very good. The bad points, over expensive mini bar and pressing services and the noise of other guests.

Saved me about 1 hour of waiting in line for a taxi if I were to try to make my way to another hotel. Located on the marina at the World Trade Center, the hotel is close enough to \u201ccivilization\u201d and far enough away to be peaceful and relaxing. The check-in was smooth and friendly, the front desk person reminded me of the end of daylight savings time, which was very helpful since I had forgotten. She told me to visit their informative concierge on making the most of our 1 day in Barcelona, and that the front desk handles all currency exchanges, at a pretty good rate, by the way. She also told me I could call ahead to make sure a taxi is available the next morning for my early flight- I did exactly that and everything went smoothly, including checkout. During most hours of the day, taxis are lined up in front so calling ahead is not needed. I booked the executive suite as we had 4 people in our party- many other Barcelona hotels cannot accommodate parties larger than 2 or 3 without getting a separate room or extra fees. I got a great deal on Travelocity, way below rack rate since we were staying only 1 night on a weekend...I think Grand Marina caters more to business and convention travelers, which is typically during the working week. Suite had 2 very large bedrooms with desk area & multiple closets, a living room and dining area (with mini fridge), and a gorgeous bathroom & vanity area. All rooms were typical of some of Barcelona's \"hip\" design styles: sliding doors for privacy, dark wood floors, modern furniture, marble bathrooms. Our view, with 2 balconies, faced the city of Barcelona and the Christopher Columbus statue at the bottom of Las Ramblas; we were on the 7th floor of 8 so the view was spectacular- we could even see La Sagrada Familia. VERY spacious, which was great after being confined to a tiny cabin on a cruise ship. Small details are great- lots of bathroom freebies (see the almost hidden middle drawer!), bathrobes and slippers, turndown service, automatic lights, 5 shower heads, bidet (as most European hotels have), Jacuzzi, high thread count sheets. The 2nd floor of the hotel has their restaurant and lounges- in the same style as the rest of the hotel, it was spacious and modern. There is a terrace with tables and fountains. The top floor has a gym with many fitness machines, a hot tub, and a small outdoor pool (great view from the pool, which is elevated). The hotel is a 5-minute walk from the bottom of Las Ramblas and next to Port Vell, which I think had been further developed during the 1992 Olympics, with restaurants, stores & an Imax theatre. The short distance from the busier parts of Barcelona made all the difference- as I said, it was quiet and peaceful at night (while I know some guests at other hotels on Las Ramblas are kept up all night due to party revelers)- we had an early flight so this was perfect. The short walk was not far from cafes (breakfast!), shops and other tourist sights. We bought tickets for white & turquoise the Barcelona Tourism bus, which had a stop right in the front of the hotel. It cost 16 euros each for 1 day and has stops all around the city- you can get on and off as you please, an alternative to those who are subway/bus map reading-deficient! Very convenient. I highly recommend this hotel- it was the perfect choice for what my needs were during my vacation.

It is right on the bus route, or 1 and 1/2 blocks away from the bottom of Las Ramblas--a pleasant distance to be sure. We would definately stay here again!", "Date": "October 8, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston,MA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location especially for Cruise ships and great rooms\u201d", "Author": "Ryther", "ReviewID": "UR2605774", "Content": "On my last trip to Barcelona I stayed at another 5-star property, the Claris, which while a block from the busy Paseo Garcia shopping street left something to be desired in the service dept. On arriving in Barcelona by cruise ship, I was astounded to discover that the hotel sits right next to where I disembarked so no taxi was neccesary to get there! The check-in (in fairness, at 8:30 a.m.) was a little bit cold and distant, however the rest of my experience was exceptionally favorable. A very large room and lovely bathroom that is typical of some of Barcelona's \"hip\" design styles. This made the view over the interior (exposed) courtyard hardly noticeable. The hotel is a 5-minute walk from the bottom of Las Ramblas and while isolated in some respects, this is a GOOD thing given the hustle and bustle of exiting most other Barcelona hotels into the crowds of many wonderful citizens and many very clever pickpockets. I highly recommend this hotel...and must add that their high-speed complimentary internet access at the concierge desk was a very pleasant surprise given how many luxury hotels have taken to charging guests for internet access.", "Date": "September 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Sean777", "ReviewID": "UR2517118", "Content": "This is a great hotel, on arrival we were upgraded without asking to a delux room with great views of a wonderful city.

As ever before deciding which hotel to book, we consulted Tripadvisor, and as ever the recommendations were spot on. This is a wonderful hotel. Pricy certainly, but worth it. We stayed at the Eurostars Grand Marina for out 1st wedding anniversary. We were no sooner in the door when room service rang and introduced themselves and asked if it would be convenient to deliver some champagne and strawberries. Great start. The breakfast is perfect, the service and food are great. Guest Services were very helpful and pointed us in the right direction for everything. The staff were efficient, courteous and pleasant, even the morning after the \"Catalonian festival\" where the majority of the staff would have been out partying until 6 AM. The rooms were huge (Not the basic rooms though, we did catch a glimpse of one of these and it looked small), with great bathrooms, a walk in wardrobe, spa bath etc. They were also quiet. We had a room overlooking the front, and had no problem with the ships docked next to us. You would have to be the lightest sleeper on earth for that to bother you. One word of warning though, The Dinner menu is \"Creative\" to say the least. Although it was an experience, there are far better dinner menus to be had in town. There is a small spot on the roof with an outdoor pool and sun lounges, although as we were only staying for 3 days we did not make great use of this as there is so much to see and so in Barcelona. Also the beaches are within easy reach if sunbathing is something you wish to pursue. Overall I would recomend this hotel to anyone wishing to splash out a bit.", "Date": "June 25, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNot 5 star quality\u201d", "Author": "Tirl", "ReviewID": "UR1870959", "Content": "went on a short break with my husband and we were very dissappointed with the service or lack of.

We made a complaint but as there were no managers and it was not the receptionists fault personally we didn't get much satisfaction.

A combination of modern architectural style, staff service, physical age, and amenities makes this property one of the very best. We reserved the hotel through a discounted service and while the rate was still high, it was worth every penny. The room is well appointed and completely spacious, with a long entryway, a walk in closet, a bathroom that had separate shower/message tub and a partition between sinks and shower. The bathroom had some of the best quality toiletries and thick bathrobes and slippers. The wooden floor resembles the current trend of using wooden floors in new homes. Also, guests get a selection of different types of pillows, though the Rita Hayworth style is the default one placed in the rooms. You get a tremendous sense of cleanliness that you would feel from your own home. The breakfast buffet included in our rate deal was extensive serving everything from bacon and eggs to Spanish specialties such as chorizo and tapa ingredients. The entire staff spoke fluent English and was very accommodating. The only drawback was that the pool was under repair and the location is almost half a mile from the closest subway stop (Drassanes). However, the metro bus line 20 does run almost to the front door of the hotel. Also, the tourisitic (open air double decker) bus runs from the front of the hotel as well.", "Date": "April 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cPerfect short break\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1805719", "Content": "Went with a girlfriend over Easter weekend - left the kids with husband.

The hotel is very new and is quite nice and the staff is well informed and friendly. There are advantages to staying in a new hotel as it does not exhibit the kind of wear and tear that is quite common in numerous \"luxury\" European hotels. The hotel upgraded us to a nice corner room and had a bottle of champagne on ice and chocolate covered strawberries in our room. A nice touch, which we appreciated. The only bummer, which to my surprise, was not noted in any previous reviews, is that the hotel is somewhat isolated. It is a 10-15 minute walk to any restaurants and shops. Not a huge distance, but there are many other hotel options that are located right in the thick of things, which is my preference. Plus, sometimes you just want to walk out to get a quick snack or buy a newspaper and hotels in Europe generally do not have gift shops.
