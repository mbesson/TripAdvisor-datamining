Free parking is provided which is rare close to Sydney city center. The motel about 20 minutes by bus from the central station during night time. It is 500m from Summer Hill train station. Be ware that not all trains stop at this station, but we found the frequency (Approx once in 15min at most times) to be fairly decent. The beds and furniture was good for a three star place. The room had a air conditioner, bar fridge, TV, tea/coffee making facilities, decent bathroom accessories (much more than what you would expect from this class). The premises was very secure. My review would have been far far better if we had not had a little bit of damp smell and a cockroach in our room. We had to keep the windows open due to the smell. The staff said that the cockroach might have come in as a result of that. Never the less, the lady at the counter was extremely cooperative. We were shown another alternate room but it seemed to have a bit of cigarette smell. She offered a full refund if we wanted to move out the next day. Given that there were few economical options close to the city, and we were going to be out of the motel most of the times, we decided just to stay on.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cVery good value!\u201d", "Author": "jimw48", "ReviewID": "UR125530861", "Content": "Have stayed at Marco Polo several times over 5 or 6 years, this time had 2 rooms for large family group.

OK, so I had read the previous reviews prior to booking and looked at the candid photos, looks a bit scary.. Sharon is the owner, is kind, caring, personable, accommodating and genuine! Paid $1,000aud for a 7 night stay family of 4. The Aria awards were Sunday and there was some car show going on so they were booked up. first issue, my Mum is elderly and not very mobile, I thought that the room would be on the 2nd floor where the car park is.. oops, that's rooms in the 100's ours was in the 200's. OK, I knew in advance there wasn't a lift. we managed the stairs with her, slow but we managed. Then when we got to our sleeps 4 family room, the floors were tile and freshly mopped.. generally not an issue, but freshly mopped tile? makes the floors slippery and with an elderly Mum susceptible to falls, not going to work.. so down I went to Sharon in reception, she switched our room without hesitation from a sleeps 4 to a sleeps 5 which has carpet! Albeit old, but it had carpet.. While it was old, it was not dingy or dirty. just old as in outdated. There isn't smoking inside the rooms, but they do have ash&butt receptacles in the hall ways. Even though it is listed as a non smoking property. At night the guests were either sitting in the doorways, or out at the ends of the walkways. Noise.. We didn't encounter much as the walls are brick which attribute to their statement of soundproof walls.. we brought ear plugs per the suggestion in the review from \"CozyPrincess\" but never used them. They started some refurbishing while we were there but we were never inconvenienced by it. security: the fact that you can't get into the property without a keycard is a good thing. there is a motel across the street and down a bit that is open.. I remarked to my daughters that I wouldn't want to stay there because of that reason. There isnt much noise from the neighbors on the back or side. so that was good. Being there with my elderly Mum, 20 year old and 16 year old daughters and being somewhat of a fraidy cat (silly sounding I know, but I'm protective) I felt very safe during our entire stay. the laundry is on the ground floor and the only negative is the steam in the room when the dryer is on.. there are 2 washers and one dryer. ironing board and iron (also in your room) the cost to wash is $3 and to dry is $2. we used 2 washers (25 minute cycle) and 1 dryer (says 25 minutes to dry but actually was 40 minutes) and had to do another dry cycle since we had 2 loads in the one dryer.. but it was really fine. Parking: there is limited parking spaces on the 2nd level. and boy are they narrow! I had a toyota Kluger and had to either take 2 spaces, park along the wall or take the far end space, tuck in the mirrors, have everyone get out from one side and pray that I could get back out when I had to leave.. so, compact car would be the choice but we had a wheel chair to deal with. OH, and there aren't family rooms on the 1st level, only 2nd.. Beds were very comfortable. I don't usually sleep well in hotel or motel beds. but I was actually finding myself sleeping quite well and rested! Mattresses were firm but not overtly firm.. practically perfect! And they were not your average cheap 4-5\" thick, they were acually quite nice and about 10-12\" thick and quilted top. at least in our room they were. bedside reading lights on the queen bed were a nice touch. Phone didn't work, was always blinking but didn't matter we had our own phones. We had plenty of room in the fridge for soda's, and frozen foods. they have cutlery, plates, mugs, glasses and washing soap for the dishes. coffee, tea, hot cocoa, cream and sugar.. Microwave, hot pot & toaster. now the bathroom............ The sink was a nice new pedestal style sink. did I mention the sink was nice? ~~giggles~~ the bathroom leaves very little to be desired. The shower stall is very small and very small....only good thing about the shower was the water pressure and temperature of the water. But again, it is very small.. The toilet is literally right next to the glass of the shower stall and made for some very interesting acrobatics for cleansing. (not trying to be gross, just trying to give you a realistic idea) and I'm 5'6,140lbs... Brought a small can of lysol, sprayed (just for my own piece of mind, I do this when I stay at any hotel) the shower floor, toilet, sink, beds(comforter, pillows etc) door knobs, light switches and basically any touchable surface including the tile floor.. germs are germs, and when you're staying in ANY hotel, you need to stay safe... Having lived in a dorm during my college years, when I travel I always wear flipflops (shower shoes) in a hotel shower.. did the blacklight patrol on the floors, beds & bathroom... no stains or discoloration anywhere.. (I'm in hotels quite alot) there is a drying line if you have some wet clothes. out of the 8 days, only 1 day room wasn't made up and that is because we left late and they didnt come back I guess.. but Sharon had it taken care of. Location was brilliant but getting to the other side of the road in a car required going around the block. didn't take the bus but it was across the street and didn't pay attention if there was a stop out front or not. no restaurant, that would have been really good. good value for the money, clean comfortable room, nice beds, good amenities, safe and secure feeling, wireless internet wasn't too slow which was a plus. daughter was video chatting with her boyfriend and was \"kicked\" off a couple times but overall was good for everything we were online for(directions, time's etc) no printer and printer in reception does not work. you could email item to Sharon and she would then print it out for you. pay phone in reception area too.. had to only give it 4/5 on serivce since they forgot our room one time.. I would absolutely stay there again.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat value option if you want to park and ride!\u201d", "Author": "NodrogSouthAustralia", "ReviewID": "UR121499002", "Content": "As this is a budget priced option, I didn't have high expectations.

Someone should nominate this place for cultural heritage listing because places like this should not be allowed to disappear. Im not talking about your average Indian back alley garbage heap or budget south-east Asian shoebox, this is a genuine 80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stereotype motel full of the dodgy characters that you would expect to see filing out from an 1980\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hollywood movie set. On my numerous visits here I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen shady figures of every kind from dirty old men, crusty pros, dodgy Lebs, loud Chinese grandmothers, 10 Indians sleeping in a room, cheating middle-aged housewives, wannabe business men, penny-pinching backpackers, try hards driving BMW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s & your assortment of tourists. Almost everyone here seems to be sneaking around with some sort of secret, which makes for colourful speculation after hours. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the sort of place where no one asks any questions & you are left to your own business which suits me fine. Now the place is old & was in need of refurbishment 20 years ago. The carpet has a deep stale tobacco smell & is notably stained to show its age. The blinds in half the rooms hang off broken hooks & the mattresses were probably purchased from some Indian backpacker joint in Bombay, maybe thats too harsh. The 80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s style furniture is worn out in some rooms & ok in others so its pot luck, but you get free cable TV & Fox Sports! Some TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are 51cms, but the Foxtel eases the pain considerably in my opinion especially if you came here by choice. This motel would not seem too out of place in Kuta Bali or any backpacker hole in Asia, its not terrible but its cheap & hey, at least your in Sydney & its not a bad place to be at least.

I used to stay here to crash with some mates after a night out on the town to watch the soccer & EPL live on Fox Sports, drink beer & smoke until 6am.
