{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Model of consistency I have stayed at the Hotel East 21 nearly 20 times over the last 6 years and is is always clean, well staffed and quite spacious for Japanese hotels. Good breakfast buffet. The refurbished outdoor pool is open now but you need to pay to use it, as with the health club. This hotel is a great value.", "Date": "Aug 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR438990944", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "merk34"}, {"Content": "good hotel, but quite far from central tokyo We came from Osaka by shinkansen and arrived at the JR Tokyo station, which was very far from the hotel. The subway will come in handy for trips to Central Tokyo and other far places in Tokyo. However, nearest subway stop (Toyocho on the Tozai Line) is still about a 7 to 10-minute walk from the hotel. Rooms are big, spacious. Beds are a little small but comfortable. And they come with two pillows! The A/C in the room was quite warm though. Best to call housekeeping and have it fixed. Bathrooms are a little small but serves its purpose. It also comes with its own pump container for shampoo, conditioner and body soap. They're very generous when it comes to towels. Staff are quite helpful but there are still a lot who cannot speak English but can only understand. It's best to talk to the Front Desk staff or the Asst. Manager if you need something. East 21 Tokyo is also a Disney partner hotel so shuttle to Disney Resort is free. Best to reserve as soon as you arrive at the hotel because shuttle tend to fill up quickly in the morning. They also provide shuttle to the nearest subway station but you will have to make reservations. Shuttle reservations can be made with the concierge. Airport limousine buses also stop here so it's pretty convenient if you don't have a ride to and from the airport. Although if you're leaving very early in the morning, it can be a bit of a hassle (which we experienced) since the first trip leaves at 7:30 in the morning.Our reservation didn't include daily breakfast but we didn't worry because there are several places that serve breakfast right outside the hotel. And there are other breakfast places in the surrounding area. There is also an am/pm convenience store outside the hotel, where you can get lots of cheap breakfast items. It's a pretty good hotel, not my first choice since I would have preferred staying near Central Tokyo. But if you prefer a quieter place that's still near Central Tokyo, then I would recommend this hotel.", "Date": "Oct 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR991083259", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "hazpafis"}, {"Content": "very nice, but out of the way... This is a really nice hotel. All the front desk staff speak English very well and are nice. The rooms for being in Japan are roomy, but not exactly spacious. I stayed on 3 different floors while at this hotel and can say that the rooms are all pretty much a like. The pool was closed when I was there, but it was still maintained nicely, with bushes and flowers. The beds are hard and uncomfortable, but that is typical of Japanese hotels. The front staff ordered my taxi's for me and made sure the driver knew where to take me which was very nice, The train station is about 10-15 minutes away, but it takes longer to get there in the morning as the sidewalks are extremely crowded, That was the one thing that I didn't like at all about this hotel; it's location. It's kind of out of the way and there's not much to do in that area. You have to be willing to take a taxi or brave the trains to get anywhere poplular. That's ok, but not for me. There are a few family restaurants below the hotel along with a coffee shop and a really big gorcery store and a couple of convenience stores as well. Overall it's a nice hotel and I would stay there again if I had to, but I like others better because of the location issue.", "Date": "May 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR579625660", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Duncaroo"}, {"Content": "Lovely memories This hotel is absolutely great!!!

The Hotel is situated just nicely out the centre of Toyko (approx 10 min walk from nearest subway train). the hotel has all the facilities needed i.e. restaurants, bars, gym, swimming etc. the negative points were all fitness (gym and swimming) are extras even to hotel residents, the restaurants and bars in the hotel are quite expensive (but i guess typical for Toyko). On a positve the hotel staff cannot do enough for you, always willing to help and the majority speak excellent english. The hotel offers free shuttle bus to Toyko disney (I never used it) and to the a local (main line) subway station (10/15 mins on the minibus). The bar on the top floor gives breath taking views of Toyko (especially at night). The rooms are spacious and have all the things you are likely to use. If i ever go back to Toyko i would stongly consider staying here again.", "Date": "Dec 3, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR269326139", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "scoob5022002"}, {"Content": "\u95c8\u70b2\u7236\u9287\ue0a0\u5138\u9289\u6b0d\u5137\u9287\u5c7c\u7b05\u9287\u5c7b\u4eef\u9287\ufe3a\u4e9c\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(22537662, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR854304866", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "\u9287\u64b1\u4e9e\u9287\u71b4\u5031"}, {"Content": "\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289\ue0a2\u61c6\u6748\u6052\u4eb4\u6e1a\u57ae\u57c4   showReview(21422075, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR273848890", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mamachari"}, {"Content": "\u93c1\u677f\u52fe\u9353\u5d83\u501b\u9288\u5a43\u67c7\u9412\u8eb2\u4e9c\u9287\u52ec\u5285\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(20208083, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR773755053", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "\u9288\u581b\u4ed0\u9287\ue1ba\u501e\u9287\u64c4\u6324"}, {"Content": "\u93b0\u71bb\u7475   showReview(19171714, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR189391289", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u7039\u5c80\u6327\u9287\u0441\u4eda\u951b?#x201d;   showReview(19158634, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 31, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR226656360", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066449-d301686-r19563956-Hotel_East_21_Tokyo-Koto_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "301686", "Price": "$314"}}
