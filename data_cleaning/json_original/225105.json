There have been a couple glitches from time to time. That is to be expected if you travel a lot. At the Peninsula they take active steps to fix those glitches, and do so in a very positive way. The rooms are very nice. I would recommend one of the suites. The bar downstairs has a great atmosphere. I made a mistake of ordering a double of a fancy bourbon and drinking the whole thing. The location is right in the middle of things. That helps on those cold windy days when you want to go somewhere, but don't want to spend a lot of time outside. The fitness center has the best overall range of equipment that I remember for a dedicated exercise facility that is not part of a larger independent fitness center that just so happens to be attached to a hotel. I have stayed at most of the high end hotels in Chicago. The Peninsula is the best in my opinion.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis", "Title": "\u201cI'm a beleiver!\u201d", "Author": "traveller4444", "ReviewID": "UR126298302", "Content": "I decided to go to Chicago this past weekend for a little business and a little pleasure. EVERYTHING was booked! All along the Mag Mile....Omni, Allerton, etc. etc..... I'd stayed on the Peninsula years ago but was too green to know a good hotel from a great hotel. But I left today...TOTALLY satisfied, and I am one PICKY SOB. :) I walked in Saturday to the registration desk and was greeted by Cecilia. I told her I'm in town for the night, don't have a room booked anywhere, and I don't want to pay a LOT of money. Well, she fixed me up with a room, and what was simply the best rate available...no special deals even with my charm and good looks, ha, ha. So....$395, and away I went to a slightly upgraded room. It was GREAT. The lighting, the colors, the cleanliness, the unmistakable attention to detail in every inch of the room was like being wrapped in a luxurious warm blanket. It just felt to GOOD! Super comfortable bed, a bathroom fit for a king, nice view, wonderful electronics (A/V, lighting, music, etc.) Five star...all the way. But here is what is different. I'm indeed used to nice hotels all over the world. But HERE, HERE, I found true customer service in EACH and EVERY employee! The Valet gentleman, the porters, Cecilia at registration, the MAID SERVICE was amazing!!! On this one point, let me elaborate. Each time I left my room (seemingly) I'd return to find my iPad cord wrapped up neatly, my toiletries, arranged label out, towels refreshed, slippers by the bed, plasma screen extended, ice in the bucket, bottle of water by the bed, etc, etc.... WONDERFUL! Our lovely maid from Sierra Leon in Western Africa was a gentle, proper, elegant woman who could NOT have done a better job. It's as though I had a dream about GREAT SERVICE, and thanks to my poor planning by not having a room reserved and serendipitously ending up at the Peninsula, it all came true. It was a pleasant surprise at EACH turn. They don't nickel and dime you either. Free WiFi, free coffee, shoe shines, tea, newspaper, and such. I know it's petty to mention that but so often at a hotel, you pay through the nose and then get hit for WiFi. I hate that. And I've NEVER had a free shoe shine. I didn't accept it, but it was all offered. Made me feel like royalty. I'm not a rich guy, and really shouldn't spend $395 plus parking and such on a night in a room, but let me say...it WAS worth it. It makes me want to work HARDER in life so I can afford such luxury again and again. Plus they're in my FAVORITE cities! Bangkok, Beijing, Paris, LA, NYC, Manila. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful in every way. Expensive? A little .

I always stay at 5 star hotels, mostly Trump or Park Hyatt. When I found out I was supposed to go to Chicago, I called Amex and the Peninsula was recommended to me as one of the most popular hotels chosen by Amex holders. The hotel was fine but.. I received a $100 spa credit. Great gift if you can use it. I was not able to. There were only 4 available spa appointments during my 3 day stay, neither of them was what I was interested in. I was told they were booked because of the Valentine's Day.. When I asked to exchange my benefit to food and drink credit, the answer was 'no'. I had to call Amex and they spoke to a hotel manager about it. The room was nice, clean and comfortable but small - if you go to the Trump Hotel, you are immediately upgraded to a suit. Their swimming pool is much smaller than the one at Trump. Hard to find a concierge - I tried 3 times, unsuccessfully. Finally, when I found him (with a little help from a receptionist), I was told they had no business facility in their hotel ! I personally had called the Peninsula before I made a reservation and I was assured the business room would be available. The concierge recommended \"a nice bar\" in the area... I spent extra hours looking for a place where I could meet my clients.

The customer service was poor. When I voiced my concern to the night manager that his security staff was being aggressive, disrespectful and inappropriate. He dismissed and antagonized me. The staff was inattentive. I had to call room service multiple times to have my ordered completed. My GF cancelled her Spa massage because the staff completely ignored when she arrived there.

At the Peninsula in Chicago you get the spectacular views (rooms, \"Bar\", the restaurant and MI avenue views are grand) but you have no clue how it all comes together.

I on the other hand took advantage of the well outfitted gym (just imagine running over the top of the water tower....that is your view) and finishing it off with a steam and/or hot tub in the pool area. The lap pool only is astonishing in its view and the staff is very very attentive on EVERY simple detail. Impressive! I am not sure if people \"with money\" read TA but for those of us who want to maximize the $ you won't go wrong at the Peninsula. From the Friday/Saturday night chocolate bar and live jazz to the fresh, and I mean fresh pastries the Penninsula is worth the splurge. Look for the packages that include breakfast ($21) and parking ($54/night) and it becomes a bit more attractive. Not inexpensive but most TREATS cost a bit more. We hand a grand deluxe king with a decent view of the water tower. But you never really want to leave the comfy bed or get out of the wonderful marble shower!

It is one of the nicer hotels in Chicago we have been wanting to visit. We took our 2 year old daughter, so opted for a suite. I looked at the floor plans prior to booking, and had decided that their least expensive Executive Suite would work best for our needs. Upon check-in, we were offered a drawing for some in-house prizes, and we drew a room upgrade to a Junior Suite. I was concerned about the lay out working as well for us. I tried to get the woman at registration to explain to me why the Junior Suite would be a better option for us, and all she kept saying was that it is a more expensive suite - as if it would be silly not to take it. We finally gave in and took the upgrade, and it was a lovely room overlooking Michigan Avenue, although I still think we maybe should have stuck with our originally reserved room. I just didn't feel the woman who checked us in was as helpful as she could have been at this level of property. We encountered other members of the front desk staff who were very helpful and friendly, and everyone was very kind to our little one. We had breakfast both mornings in The Lobby restaurant. The food was good, and the service was great the first day and just okay the second day. Valet was efficient, all things considered with that location, and very friendly. We used the pool several times throughout our 2 night stay, and the people who worked in the spa were always very kind to bring goggles and toys for my daughter. The pool area was very nice, with the air temperature kept warm and the water slightly cool for those wanting to swim laps. The entire property was spotless at all times. Housekeeping was very good, and we appreciated them remembering to make up the sleeper sofa for our daughter the second night.

There was no line at the check in counter, and they made us feel welcome as returning guests and even greeted my daughter by name. When we have stayed there for birthdays, they always leave a lovely plate of fruit and treats for us. The rooms are supremely comfortable, and the tv in the bathtub is always a highlight for the kids. The pool is clean and large enough for laps and is rarely crowded. The gym is well equipped and the spa services are fabulous. We were in a rush to get to the airport on the morning of check-out and told our waiter at breakfast in the lobby restaurant that we needed to get out quickly.

Long story short--we called the front desk to tell them we didn't think it was a Hastens bed (they have a distinctive checked pattern) and were assured by the front desk, in a somewhat snotty way, that it in fact was. As we were getting ready to check out, housekeeping pulled the sheets off & I saw that it was a Sealy mattress. I just felt kind of ripped off. We decided to give it another try last weekend. This time we were disappointed due to the overall attitude of most of the hotel staff. The concierge desk (more than one) was unorganized and a bit snotty in booking dinner reservations, etc. I asked a female concierge for advice on a restaurant and she was uninterested in helping me. I should also add that it is quite difficult to call the concierge from outside of the hotel. Go ahead, try it. You will not find the number online and will have to be given another number to call, be transferred, etc. Not a big deal if everyone is nice and helpful when you finally get through. What, to me, separates a luxury hotel from a regular hotel is the degree of service and how that service makes you feel as a guest of the hotel. For example, at most Four Seasons properties, the staff makes you feel like a rock star. Cheesy, but true. Guests want to feel important. Here, the service was very inconsistent and I felt the attitude was almost like an East Coast snobby vibe (no offense intended). No major rudeness, just like we were inconveniencing them to ask for something. Room service was at times wonderfully polite and then mediocre, depending upon who answered. As for housekeeping, we left one morning at around 9:30am & put the \"please make up room\" light on. When we came home at 5:30pm to shower and change for dinner, the maid had just arrived and had not started cleaning yet. Just kind of an inconvenience. The one bright spot was the bell and valet staff. They were exceptionally courteous and helpful. In fairness, I should mention that the hotel is lovely. And it is quite welcoming of families with children. There was a very nice welcome treat (with gummy bears) that my kids really enjoyed. They were also thoughtful enough to provide small robes and slippers for the kids. While they do have a nice-sounding children's menu, some of the food we ordered was really subpar (ie-chicken fingers were pretty bad, as was the \"children's tea\"--my kids wouldn't eat it). Overall, my main issue is attitude.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfield County, CT", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel.

I did not ask the staff for n alternate; they came with it in any event. We were working in a suite on a business program, ordered coffee.

We were lucky to be part of The Tenth Year Anniversary Celebration that the hotel had to offer. This basically was an offer for the first night room rate at full price and then the second night rate at $10 dollars!!! Yes I took the offer! I had called the hotel for an early check-in. When we arrived we were able to get into our beautiful Delux Suite 3 hours early!!! Upon entering our suite we had a welcome card and assorted fruit and nut tray. After going out for a few hours we returned to a complimentary bottle of fine wine and chocolates. We had room service twice a day. If you can afford a Delux Suite I would say go for it.We had two queen beds in the bedroom although you can have the choice of a one king bed in this type of suite.This suite also has a pull out bed in the living room if needed . The suite had an luxurious master bath and off the living foyer is a very nice half bath. My daughter said that she would actually love to live in this suite.We did have a small view of Lake Michigan. The gym on the 20th floor is well equipped with even better views of the city and servral views of Lake Michigan.We did not use the spa but I will on the next visit. We had afternoon tea in the main restaurant/lobby area both days.The tea selection is over the top as you might expect. We enjoyed the orchid oolong tea with a vanilla -coconut flavor. Our first night we had dinner in The Shanghi Terrace at 7:30 pm. There were quite a lot of children having dinner before this time. I opted for indoor seating which I felt to be more intimate and quite than outdoor seating. By 7:30 pm most of the children had had their dinner and there were no children seated indoors when we had our very fine 2 and half hour feast on a friday night.. I enjoyed the Crispy Duck as my entree. One nice feature about our suite is that several side windows could be cracked open a bit letting lake breezes fill the room if you wish..

No doubt if you are considering staying here, you already know this. For this reason, it seems a little unfair to compare it up against hotels that are charging much less for a nights stay. It never feels quite right to me to expect the same thing out of a Kia as one would out of a Masserati. So...in my review, I'm really only comparing it up against similar hotels who charge fairly handsome prices. First of all, it's an attractive hotel. Clean, comfortable, great location just around the corner from Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue. If shopping is your thing, you won't have far to cart your new treasures. The staff is understandably and appropriately solicitous. And they should be. For the price, an extremely helpful staff in not a nicety, but a given. We stayed in a one bedroom suite. Obviously, everything was clean and reasonably state of the art. There were many remote control features, my favorite being the television that could be accessed from the bathtub. (The technology was slightly old, but still very nice.) The bed was extremely comfortable, the room reasonably quiet considering it looked out onto the traffic of Michigan Avenue. The hall noise was non-existent. Room service was quick and efficient, and the food was acceptable, if not mouth-wateringly delicious. My son had high praise for the club sandwich with avocado and egg, but not having tasted it personally, I really can't comment. We dined at the Michelin Two Stars Avenues restaurant. It is the pride of the Peninsula, and it's a pretty decent restaurant if you enjoy adventurous eating. If not, I'd say skip it. Our bill for three people - this includes four alcoholic beverages - was over $600.00. So...this was a pre-fixe menu, and included roughly eight courses of Very Unique food. Amazing presentation, amazing service...Very Unique food. This is the type of thing one probably encounters on very upscale cooking shows, but rarely encounters in their everyday life. I'm glad I tried it, but a little bit of sea urchin goes a long way. Capiche? We ate breakfast one morning in the lobby restaurant, and I would have to say that those orders of Eggs Benedict and that bowl of oatmeal were pretty lackluster. I don't mind paying for things if they hold merit, but I don't like to be taken any more than the next person, and the day that a few skimpy plates of eggs and overcooked hash browns combined with a bowl of oatmeal and berries equals out to over $80.00 - well, that's a sad day in my culinary digest. Anyway, the hotel owns a far better breakfast and lunch cafe adjacent to the lower level of the hotel, and it's a much better choice for casual and tasty dining. So, in closing, the Peninsula is a fine enough hotel, but certainly nothing for bargain hunters. The location is probably it's most pertinent distinction, but clearly it's a top notch hotel as well.

There was absolute no sound from outside or the other rooms on your floor. There was plenty of storage room and closet space. The marble bathroom absolute perfect and clean. Robes, slippers and the really wonderful Davi bath-products added up to the experience. Our room did not provide much of a view but it was OK for us.

Each night during turn down service they also set your slippers on each side of the bed and placed them on a cloth mat. The bathrobes were long enough for a change, very clean, and very comfortable. The towels were extremely white, plush, and perfect in every way. There was a scale, hair blower, and plenty of high quality soap/shampoo. The service was incredible in every way. If you ask someone where something is, they TAKE YOU THERE. We requested a 2PM check out time and that was not a problem at all. The SPA was very clean and the people who work there are very respectful and helpful in every way. The GYM was constantly being cleaned, even though it was already clean. They offered water and fruit, cold towels, stretching room, modern equipment, yoga paraphernalia, etc. I believe there was a pool, but I did not use it. I will separately review their restaurant and catering food separately... but I will say here that they were all 5 star. I cannot wait to go back and I was unhappy to leave. Lastly, the concierge was dead on with everything they assisted with. This is a DOG FRIENDLY hotel and you will see some of the cutest dogs walking through the lobby... often being walked by a member of the hotel staff, dressed as a bell boy, with white gloves, taking the pooch our for a walk.

We stayed there one night recently (at the same time Dave Mathews was a guest!) As many locals know, the Peninsula is only a couple of blocks away from Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Ambulances arrive there throughout the day & night. Even on a high floor, the street noise is very apparent in the guest rooms. In this aspect, the Peninsula is no better than any 2 or 3 star hotel. European 5-star hotels I've stayed at have two sets of windows in the guest rooms. Two hotels that come immediately to mind are the Hotel Paris (\"Pariz\") in Prague & the Berkeley in London. Our rooms in both these hotels had two sets of windows, with a wide air gap in between.. It really makes a difference! Fortunately, I always keep a pair of earplugs in my travel kit, so I was fine. But my friend was a bit annoyed by the constant wail of sirens & made a number of unfriendly remarks about \"the city\". If street noise isn't a concern, then I would agree that the Peninsula could be considered 5-star. Otherwise, it's 4-star at best.

For example, our group was only offered coffee, tea, or water during our meeting, no selection of soft drinks or juices. The breakfast selection was small (eggs, toast, bread, croissants only).

My wife had planned that a couple trays of chocolates, fruit, and nuts be in the room upon arrival.

My room was extremely spacious (see photos)--separate living room, entrance hallway, connecting hallway, etc. One of my favorite things about the Peninsula is the amount of room devoted to dressing--plenty of closet space, drawers, and mirrors. The sound-proofing was superb--windows open you could hear sirens and all the other sounds of the city, but once they were closed there was no sound from outside. One of the most attractive things about this room was the bathtub with a window overlooking Michigan Avenue--I took baths just to be able to look through the window! The technology is, if anything, over the top--I counted six telephones or equivalents (like the voice-operated one in the bathtub) in the suite, two televisions, a stereo system, and the Peninsula-standard electronic control systems (see photo)--on one morning when I slept in light and housekeeping knocked on the door (a long way from the bedroom) I just had to roll over and hit the \"Privacy\" button on the phone--a light turned on outside the room and that was it. No complaints at all about this trip, but I do have two suggestions, both from The Berkeley in London-- 1) The deck chairs on the sun roof outside often appeared occupied even though no-one was there--it would be worthwhile to clean these more frequently or to put up a sign asking people to clear away their belongings when they were done so that more people could enjoy the sun deck. 2) Shoes left overnight for polishing should be returned with temporary shoe trees.", "Date": "September 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cAbsolute Perfection....Didn't want to leave!!\u201d", "Author": "krittert", "ReviewID": "UR39489797", "Content": "Hands down the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in.

My wife and I were accompanied by our two children . Our son is aged 5 and and our daughter is aged 18 months. We had never been to the Peninsula before, but its reputation convinced me to stay there. I arranged through the hotel to have a car to meet us at the airport upon our arrival. Inside the terminal a man was waiting for us holding a Peninsula Hotel sign. He greeted us and led us outside to the waiting car. Our car was a black Lincoln stretch limousine. My son loved the car and the driver whisked us away from the airport for a relaxing ride to the hotel. We pulled up to the hotel which is guarded by two very large oriental lion statues. We were greeted by a very friendly doorman named Timothy. He took my name and said our bags would be delivered to our room shortly. We proceeded inside the hotel and took the elevator to the lobby to check in. We were greeted warmly as we completed our check in. The Lobby Restaurant room was near the elevators and it is just as stunning in person as in all pictures I had seen of it. The friendly woman who checked us in led us to the elevator and took us to our room on the twelfth floor. We had booked a junior suite #1217 because we needed the space. The room was done in shades of yellow and gold. The truly great hotels always do the little things that set them apart and the Peninsula accomplished this brilliantly. On the cocktail table in front of the sofa in the living room was a paper model of a 1956 light blue Ford Thunderbird convertible. Inside the seating compartment was a linen napkin wrapped around two chocolate chip cookies. Next to the car was a martini glass filled with gummy bears. Next to the martini glass was a small teacup and saucer and a small silver spoon. Inside the teacup was orange gelatin. There was also a beautiful purple box of Vosges Haut-Chocolat exotic truffles on the desk. The room looked out onto N. Michigan Avenue and the large window made the view exceptional. The room was spacious and inviting. The next wonderful detail that the hotel accomplished still puts a smile on my face. In the closet were robes for us to wear while we relaxed. There were two adult robes and two robes for the children. The robes for the children had hoods and were sized so as to fit them each perfectly. We got some great photographs of the kids in those robes. The room was equipped with consoles by the bed that controlled all the environmental adjustments for the room. The bathroom was gorgeous and well-equipped. There was a television that could be viewed while bathing in the bathtub. The kids loved watching TV while taking their evening baths. Turn down service was completed every evening much to our satisfaction. We had lunch at the french bistro connected to the hotel. The food and service were both excellent. After our visit to the observation deck of the Sears Tower, we returned to the hotel and had dinner at the Lobby Restaurant. This restaurant is a gorgeous palatial space. The food was wonderful as was our server Don. I enjoyed a Peninsula Martini and my wife enjoyed her Blood Orange Martini. After dinner we retired to our room and I slept deeply on the very comfortable bed. The next morning, I watched the kids while my wife indulged in a swedish massage at the Spa. She said Donald did a great job. After that we all had breakfast in the the french bistro and headed out to see some of the culture of the city. We took the kids to the Science and Industry Museum, Millenium Park and the Art Institute of Chicago. The weather was cooperative with the temperature in the mid to upper 40's and mostly sunny. The Cloud Gate was fun to see in person. Upon our return to the hotel, my son and I enjoyed the pool and the hot tub before we went to dinner. What a scenic setting to swim laps. I loved it. I wanted to try Chicago style pizza on our last night so I phoned the Concierge and she recommended either Gino's East or Giordano's. Since we had the kids, we chose Giordano's because it was right across the street on North Rush Street. We ordered the stuffed pizza and it was incredibly good. I was raised on the thin crust pizza of New Haven, Connecticut but I got to tell you, the stuffed pizza here, while different ,was every bit as enjoyable as any pizza I have ever had. After dinner we retired to our room, bathed the kids and fell asleep. The next morning we had an early breakfast in the Lobby Restaurant. Again, the food and service were excellent. We returned to our room and collected our luggage and proceeded to check out. I used the express checkout method and we took the elevator to the ground level. Timothy the doorman saw us off and our limousine returned us to O'Hare for our trip home.

The bedrooms were average in size and d\u00c3\u00a9cor and generally underwhelming. The bathrooms however, were fabulous. There was a television above the bathtub, and ample space to get ready. The hotel supplied Molton Brown products as well as toothbrushes, razors, sewing and nail kits, etc. Beds were comfy, and free bottles of water piled up after turndown. My major qualm with our room was the technology. I was under the impression that everything would be very high tech and sleek and it just wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. The bulky control centers were confusing and outdated. And the plasma TV and DVD players I thought I was getting were clunky and old. I think its time for an upgrade. The service was mediocre at best. While everybody was polite, I felt as if the Peninsula\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employees were only greeting me because it was their job to do so, not because they cared about me. Several times I had to be the person who initiated the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hello\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good morning.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to be waited on hand and foot, but the occasional feeling that the concierge or front desk or dining room servers were happy to see me would have been nice. In terms of hotel food, the room service was average. My family ordered some snacks one day and nothing was exceptional. Breakfast at Avenues was delicious, but nothing I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get at any other fine hotel. I do not recommend tea. The tea was ok, but the food was horrible. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I enjoyed a single thing, and there was plenty to choose from. The thing that I liked best about the hotel was its location. All of Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highlights, including the shops on Michigan Avenue and Navy Pier, are just a walk away. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty to do, see, buy and eat, and no need for a taxi or rental car to get there. I absolutely love Chicago, and its hard to fault the Peninsula for making my time less fun filled, because it most certainly was. However, next time, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll opt to stay at the Drake or the W Lakeshore, where I can get a little more bang for my buck\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand a little personality.", "Date": "January 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mount Dora, Florida", "Title": "\u201cloved the Peninsula\u201d", "Author": "joelfranceusa", "ReviewID": "UR20927280", "Content": "Wonderful stay, pure luxury, excellent service, we will go back", "Date": "October 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel with great food\u201d", "Author": "TravelCuties", "ReviewID": "UR20843295", "Content": "I stayed at the Peninsula Chicago for two nights in October 2008 while on business.

Friendly staff, we got an upgrade when we checked in. Courteous prompt attention the whole time. When we checked in, we had a little fruit/nut plate waiting for us, and they brought us welcome green tea within 1/2 hour of check-in. That was a nice touch. Suite size was great. Laid out well, lots of room, and it had my favorite thing--a bathtub with a giant window above it. They gave us a late check out of 3pm, which was awesome. Here are the cons: The decor is a little dated and worn. The carpet in our room had what at first looked like a huge water stain running down the hall, upon closer inspection was a tread path from overuse. The very complicated lighting system did not work. There are panels all over the room to control lights and other systems, and they malfunctioned the whole time. Which meant that when we tried to go to sleep that night, we could NOT TURN THE LIGHTS OFF. We had to call maintenance. To their credit, they sent someone up right away to reset. However, the problem continued throughout the night with the lights going on and off as we were sleeping. Yeah, REALLY annoying. Luckily I had a couple cocktails (hey, it was Bluesfest), so I was able to go back to sleep each time. We told the staff when we were checking out about the problem.

Every need was anticipated and there was a thoughtful touch at every turn. I spent Easter weekend in Chicago and stayed at both the Four Seasons and the Peninsula, and though the 4S was nice and thoroughly professional, it paled next to the Peninsula. My stay here was starting off well anyway, since I had gotten a special holiday rate of $295/night. That's practically unheard-of for this hotel. Despite the low rate, I was still upgraded to a premium-view room on check-in, with a direct view of the water tower and the Hancock Tower. The rooms are wonderfully plush, with closet and drawer space set in a vestibule outside the bathroom so that there's room for a full sofa even in the standard rooms. Bedding is tops, and though the color scheme is still primarily beige, there are nice colorful touches in the textiles. Of course you've probably read about all the high tech gizmos and how practically everything is controlled by a button [Except, oddly enough, the curtains, which are still pullcord-operated. That and the fact that the hotel really needs to upgrade to flat-screen TVs would be my only small quibbles.] The bathrooms are glorious, with deep soaking tubs, easy-to-operate fixtures with great temperature control, and the TV/radio operated from a tubside control. I was checked in by a professional, warm staffer who handed me confirmed restaurant reservations--even though I had booked them through OpenTable; there must be some sort of name cross-checking. I then got a personal tour of the room including its electronics. The Lobby is a huge, beautiful space with tall columns and an airy feel. It's Art Deco with Asian touches. Lunch service there was flawless; the menu is fairly standard for this sort of place, though they do have purple sweet-potato fries. I also went back for the weekend evening chocolate fantasy. At $33, it's a bit of indulgence since you can really only eat so much chocolate late at night without making yourself sick. However, it's a nifty signature offering and just the selection of offerings is fun; plus, they were all tasty. Just off the bright lobby is the bar, which is a totally different environment--dark and moody, with sofa seating as well as the bar itself. Again, attentive service and nice selection. I also had dinner at Shanghai Terrace where I was again pampered beyond belief and found the food delicious. I was there at opening, so had the place almost to myself for a while. It's not cheap, but $115 per person including appetizer, soup course [lobster, mmm], entree, dessert, two cocktails, and tip certainly isn't outrageous. The top-floor pool here is a nice amenity. Always plenty of seating, and the floor-to-ceiling views over the neighboring buildings certainly make it an unusual setting and experience. Just know that there are usually children there and with the hard surfaces, it's not a quiet and relaxing place. The spa certainly is, though. In short, if you can handle the cost for when you're staying, you can't do any better in Chicago. The hotel sits dead-center of the Miracle Mile, and the Chicago subway stop is about a 3-minute walk away.

Our check in experience was inexcusable for a hotel of this reputation and star rating. A week before our arrival the hotel contacted me regarding our arrival time (1pm), number in our family, names, ages, etc... When we arrived the woman that checked us in was less than friendly (much less) and informed us that our room wasn't ready. She also asked how many people would be staying in the room, eventhough I clarified that before our arrival. I asked if it would be possible to pay for an upgraded room that was currently available, but she waved me off saying \"no, nothing's available\" and that she'll call my cell when the room is ready.

She didn't bother to even estimate when the room would be ready, or direct us to a place to wait. We, myself and 2 children, then wandered the hotel looking for an open restaurant (it was 4 degrees outside and I didn't feel like bundling the kids back up and walking around). It was a Sunday and there was literally ONE place serving in the hotel, which was the lobby lounge. We asked the hosted to be seated at one of the empty tables, but she insisted that they were reserved and nothing would be available for half an hour. I then asked if there were ANYPLACE in the hotel where we could wait and the hostess rudely pointed to her left and said \"maybe over there\". After over an hour of waiting \"over there\", I finally gave up on being seated in the lobby and approached the front desk again. It was a different agent, this time a very friendly gentleman, and I asked the status of our room.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure that there are enough superlatives in my vocabulary to completely describe my experience at The Peninsula. The only downside is that this hotel will possibly ruin you for all lesser offerings. My wife and I moved here for one night after spending two nights across the street at the Ritz-Carlton. The desk staff at the Peninsula was accommodating was able to get us assigned a room at the early time of 10:00 AM even though we were visiting on a very busy weekend. This was a nice surprise to begin our stay. The friendly clerk then walked us to our room, introduced us to the many features of the room, and verified that everything was to our satisfaction. I found the level of service throughout the hotel to be exceptional. Every employee that I came into contact with was polite and helpful. The room was very nice. We had reserved basic room, and found it to be quite comfortable and spacious. The earth toned d\u00c3\u00a9cor is elegant without being overwhelming. The bed and linens are just wonderful, and it can be hard to coax yourself out of bed in the morning. The fact that you can control all of the electrical for your room from a bedside panel was a feature that I had never before experienced, and I just loved it. The bathroom was also large and well appointed. A two person soaking tub with a television perched above was on the far wall. Another control panel for the lights, radio, television, and phone are within easy reach. The tub\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speakerphone even neutralizes the sound of the water so that a caller does not hear that you are calling from the tub! The bathroom which is all finished in marble and frosted glass also includes a large shower and other necessary facilities. The room also contains a fair sized closet, electronic safe, personal fax machine, DVD Player, and well stocked mini-bar. The 19th and 20 floors are where the pool and spa are located. We found these areas to also be very nice. Most of the common areas were stocked with chilled bottled water, and the lobby had a coffee bar set up in the AM hours. The hotel bar is a warm, inviting place to have a drink. However, it can get quite crowded. If there are any negatives to mention, I would say that the selection of soaps in the room could have been better. Also, parking $$$ will break you if you bring an auto, but I guess that is pretty standard for downtown Chicago. In conclusion, this place is just the best! At least the best I have ever stayed in. the Peninsula has a great location right on North Michigan, a warm, friendly staff, and very comfortable rooms.

We had three rooms adjacent to each other, one with a Bed and Breakfast package. Two of our rooms were ready at check in time, but the third was not ready even an hour later. We found out that a prior guest had smoked in the room and they were trying to air it out. It never did air out over our stay. To the credit of the hotel, they did offer to move us on our second day, but we declined because of the hassle factor. Otherwise, check-in was the low point of our stay. The person that checked me in seemed to not know what to ask me, how to print out the check in card, and never asked me questions about newspaper preferences, food allergies, etc. that the others in my party were asked. The woman who checked in my mother was downright rude, talking down to her in an insulting way. We believe she is the assistant manager, but we aren't sure. This did not start our stay off well, especially when we found out her room was the one that had been smoked in. Actually, the main level with the restaurants, check in, and concierge always reeked of smoke. We wondered if there was a cigar bar in the hotel. A good reason to ban smoking in all public areas of hotels, in our opinion. Other than this worrisome beginning, the rest of the stay was great. We loved the rooms - regal, warm decor, a stupendous bathroom, great a/c during a very hot time, and staff that catered to our many requests prompty and graciously. Softest sheets ever and large, thirsty towels -- heaven! We had a number of treatments in the spa, all great. The facilities were top notch and very clean. We had afternoon tea the day we arrived and it was lovely. However, the breakfast package proved to be a bust. Their breakfast menu is fairly limited and the food was outrageously expensive. I don't mind paying $30+ per person for breakfast, but I want a lot of choices, served promptly. Service was uniformly slow in the Dining Room, although waiting in such a grand space was not the worst thing in the world! It is hard to decide if the experience was worth the price we paid.

The decor/furnishings were unblemished and that bathtub was pretty neat with the TV. The only weird thing: the toilet is enclosed by frosted glass walls within the bathroom.

The Peninsula offered prompt, courteous, professional and highly competent service throughout, in a serene and elegant setting. We would stay there again in a heartbeat. When we arrived we found we'd been upgraded to the Topaz Suite and it was stunning. Quiet, immaculate, tastefully decorated, with a kitchenette, dining area big enough for all of us, lovely bathrooms, etc. There were fresh orchid and other flower arrangements in every room. Complimentary champagne, chocolates and other treats for the kids were very much appreciated. And the rooms had wonderful views of the water tower, lake and Michigan Avenue. The concierge and front desk were extremely helpful. We were allowed a late checkout at 5:30pm, which was great. Room service was excellent, always arriving within 30 minutes, and the food was fantastic. I mean, really really good. We also enjoyed the Chinese restaurant downstairs. Not your ordinary Chinese restaurant, the food seemed more interesting and authentic than the usual fare. The only thing that was even close to a disappointment was the lobby restaurant. The chocolate buffet was probably not worth the cost, unless you take the live music into account, which on the night we were there was an excellent small jazz group with a fantastic vocalist. Might have been better to just have a drink and skip the buffet. At the other end of the spectrum was the Sunday brunch buffet. This was truly outstanding, with more choices of foods, of the highest caliber, than I've ever seen at a Sunday brunch. This was one of the high points of our stay. The kids loved the pool and hot tub. My husband and I fell in love with the fitness center. I'm partial to working out, if not outdoors, then in a room with big windows, and the fitness center really delivered, with excellent machines facing huge windows on the 20th floor.

Since many of the reviews touch on the beauty of the hotel which is as beautiful as everyone says, I'll gear my review towards those traveling with small children and trying to decide if this hotel is a good fit. 1. Location. The Peninsula was perfectly situated for all our excursions to the various museums around town since it's a block from Watertower, the Disney store on Michigan, a couple blocks from Lake Shore Drive and about 2 blocks from the \"El\" elevated trains/subway. The American Girl store is on the same block around the corner and the Hershey Store and Girardelli were just a few steps more. Plenty of shopping for everyone on Michigan Ave. 2. Staff. Everyone was friendly to us and our children. The staff of Avenues was fantastic. Those on the Lobby Restaurant were hit or miss. 3. Restaurants/Food. The Children's Afternoon Tea in the Lobby was yummy with mini hamburgers, PB & J, & ham and cheese in addition to the sweets and a pot of hot chocolate. Pierre Gourmet, the French Cafe just outside the main entrance, was perfect for breakfast (and probably for lunch). The staff and friendly and attentive to us and our children. Room service did well by us when we ordered dessert for the family one evening. Everything arrived on time and was as ordered. The hotel does have a children's menu at the Lobby and Avenues but the selection is somewhat limited. 4. Pool. There are three swimming lanes and a hot tub on the 19th floor. There were a few swimmers swimming laps while we were there who were politely tolerant of the 10+ children in the area. While not ideal for children or those who are swimming laps for that matter, it might make a good 30 minute diversion. 5. Pen Kids Package. We researched the various packages at the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton before picking the Peninsula. The most kid friendly package was at the Ritz Carlton and it provided the most value for the $. If you choose the Peninsula, I would go with the standard room rate or the American Girl package and spend the additional $60+/per night from the Pen Kids Package elsewhere. With the package, the kids got a nice welcome snack, Pen Kids multi-color backpacks, a signature bear (who can't keep it's pants on), crayons and some coloring paper. We also received two coupons (one for ice cream at Bloomingdale's and children's admission to the Children's Museum at Navy Pier). A better investment is to buy a family membership at your local ASTC museum which had reciprocity at a number of museums in Chicago (Museum of Science & Industry, Children's Museum and Field Museum, to name only a few). 6. Room. Our bathroom was a nice extension of the main room. Whenever we were there, the kids wanted to take a bath and watch cartoons. This came in handy if one of the kids wanted to nap or as a diversion if one woke up before the other in the morning. 7. We also took advantage of the Thanksgiving buffet offered by the hotel. The food came from all three restaurants and exceeded our expectations. The hotel had also created a separate kids area with movies, playstation, and crafts that our kids enjoyed. The only negative were the $18 mimosas we ordered with the meal but thought were included with the buffet. All in all the Peninsula is a wonderful hotel, in a great location. It is clear that the chain is trying to cater to families - the kids room during the buffet was a good example of this.", "Date": "November 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience in Chicago\u201d", "Author": "jah123", "ReviewID": "UR4144978", "Content": "When I arrived at the Peninsula after the usual traffic filled ride from O'Hare, I was completedly frazzled and must have shown it.

I noted no negatives (allowing dogs is a major plus in my book); you just can't beat this place!", "Date": "September 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guttenberg, NJ", "Title": "\u201cA class apart in Chicago\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3718585", "Content": "It lived up to all my expectations of a Peninsula hotel (this being my first one).

Besides being EXPENSIVE (Room - minibar-room service), It is a sublime experience - right down to the slippers. Most people that stay here are used to being pampered and the Peninsula does not disaapoint. However - I was very disappointed with the valet service - insomuch to the point of being downright cranky about it. I called down from my room prior to checkout at about 8:30 am and asked for my car to be sent. At 9:15, I was still waiting for it with a 10:00 am flight from Midway (needless to say I missed my flight). The gentleman at the valet podium was very apologetic and trying hard to compensate with extremely charming conversation but I was upset, nonetheless. My car did not arrive until 9:30 - ONE WHOLE HOUR after I called for it. This is very bad. They explained that they were putting air in my tire - which is very nice but it had been there overnight and had plenty of time to do so without jeopardizing my flight. Will I stay at the Peninsula again? Ye, of course. It is one of only two five star hotels in Chicago. The other being the Four Seasons. And even though the Peninsula is more expensive (about $100.00 more per night for a standard room), it is less \"snobby\" (my opinion), less \"put on\" with all the amenties and ambience expected for the $600.00 per night plus room rate. The room service menu is good but a little to PanAsian. Could do with a little more versatility, though there are a few \"midwestern\" options. The bed and linens - excellent - better than home. I slept like a baby. The bathroom is fantastic - way better than the Four Seasons. Just take my advice and make sure they bring you your car on time! I luckily was able to catch another flight 30 minutes later and it didn't really affect my trip - but if I had bee going somewhere else it could have been a real issue.", "Date": "July 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canton, MI", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "beach47", "ReviewID": "UR3682250", "Content": "My husband, 10 year old daughter, and I just returned from a weekend at the Chicago Penninsula Hotel. It was great! The hotel was beautiful and the staff was wonderful! While we were checking in, my daughter was playing with her 2 American Girl dolls. One of the people at check in noticed and sent up 2 little bathrobes and 2 little beds for the dolls without us even asking for it or being told about it! Also, after returning from dinner that night, we were pleasantly surprised to find a note not only welcoming us, but cookies, gummie bears for my daughter, and a fruit tray for us! We loved the hotel also because of all the little details to attention. We tried the chocolate buffet one night as well...which is not to be missed! It was excellent! We stayed in a Grand Deluxe king room. It was a very nice room..the only thing is, it is a little tightly spaced, but not too uncomfortable. I also tried the spa, and it was very nice as well. The exercise room and pool area had a very open feel too it. Overall, it was a great hotel and I would highly recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "July 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cPure Heaven!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3679132", "Content": "We stayed here for two nights-our wedding night and one more.

The room itself was stunning and we couldn't believe the door bell, lighting system, and master bath, bigger than our livingroom in our apartment. The concierge was able to make us a dinner reservation (and when we arrived, I overheard them on the phone saying they were booked) and arrange a car to take us home, which ended up being a stretch limousine.
