At first we were put in room 400 (the top floor), throughout the first afternoon we could here scratching in the ceiling, we were then woken up at 2.30 am to the sound of an animal moving around in the ceiling, which strangely sounded like a rabbit. We called someone up from reception who promised to change our rooms the next day. We later realised they have wild rabbits around the area so assumed the noise we heard was a rabbit(s) living in the roof. We then tried to go back to sleep to then be woken up by another scratching noise, to then discover this noise was not in the ceiling but in our room inside the dressing table (between the wall and table), I then saw a mouse through a cable hole in the table! We got into our second room at 2 o'clock the next day (you are not allowed into your room before this time under any circumstances). This room was fine, we didn't hear anymore noises, it was clean and tidy, despite looking out onto the motorway it was surprisingly quiet. We found most of the staff to be polite and helpful. The hotel is in a residential area which we had read many complaints about prior to staying there, however we didn't have any issues. The hotel is a short tram ride away from the city and other restaurants and attractions. Due to our experience in the first room we would not advise anyone to eat in the hotel as we don't know whether they have a problem with mice and other animals.

This was not an unusual problem as I heard other people being told the same thing and being moved to other hotels, whereas we were given a different room. I also heard someone trying to book a room directly at reception to be told \"We don't take bookings here, you have to do it online\". Seriously. We eventually received a key card but found this didn't work and had to go back down 2 flights of stairs to reception and wait again so they could fix this. Then the room we were given and the whole corridor was freezing cold and the temperature control stuck on air conditioning and we had not been given a remote control to change this. Another long wait at reception and this was sorted by about 1am. The fire escape at the end of the corridor was wedged open, which was why it was freezing. The room was clean apart from the shower which had some mould in it and towels, shower gel, liquid soap and a TV were provided. A snack bar in reception provided a decent-sized breakfast called 'breakfast-to-go' although actually on a plate for 3,75 which is quite a bargain. So no more problems until my dad who was staying with my mum in a nearby hotel fell and broke his front tooth. I queued for about 10 mins to speak to someone at reception - even though what looked like the manager was standing supervising a trainee receptionist and not doing anything else. I eventually got his attention and asked for the number of a local emergency dentist to which I received the reply \"We are busy, you can google it yourself\". The hotel did have free wi-fi but no computer and my crappy phone did not want to connect to this without me turning on my data services and I was worried about roaming charges. In the end we gave up and my dad had to wait til we got back to the UK. Am I asking too much for a hotel to have written down some emergency contacts? It would take them about 10 mins on a one-off occasion. Overall I would recommend this hotel for its spaciousness (wide open reception and stairs not like typical Amsterdam buildings) and cleanliness but definitely not for its service.

On the first few visits on several occasions i and a freind were sleeping in our room when we woke to find a member of the hotel staff opening our room door with no real reason. The staff did not seem to be as friendly as you would of hoped and were not helpful at all. On my 5th stay a number of items got stolen from our room, clothes, aftershave, and a rucksack had been stolen with no sign of a break in. We were told by THE MANAGER of the hotel that no1 had a key apart from us and her. We found a english maintenance man strollinou want safe andg the corridors the next day with a master key to every room.!!! If you want a place to stay that you can FEEL SAFE IN. . . .

Paid \u00c2\u00a3200.00 for the hotel and flights for two people. Arrived at the airport and never really looked in to how to get to the hotel, which is really unlike me, ended up gettng a cab!!..... Got well and truly KNOCKED!!... my own fault i know but 42 Euro's for not even a 15 minute drive was shocking!!. I thought i would expect this in London!!. Arrived at the hotel which looked like it was in the middle of a council estate. The staff were friendly and we had arrived early and was unable to check in to our room, but we were able to leave our luggage in the luggage room which was locked!. The Tram is literally a 10 minute walk from the hotel which takes you right in to the town centre you are able to get a tram ticket which last's an hour which was 2.60 euro. you are also available to get a 24 hour pass for which was seven euro. The trams come literally every ten minute's and takes about 18 minute's to get to the central station. We stayed in room 152 which was freezing cold.... the shower was really hot which was a huge bonus. Could have moved and moaned but literally only slept there. The room was basic with two single beds and was in the first floor had a bar area which i never used but did get hotchocolate at 3 am one morning and the staff were really friendly and helpful. The bathroom was cold and old but the shower was really hot..... which was lovely coz the room was so cold, the telly worked not that i watched it and the lights worked!!. The hotel corridor's were dirty and stunk of weed, it was a non smoking hotel but stunk of weed. on the saturday walked around the city centre and was making myself aware of the city centre and having been my first time in Amsterdam i was SHOCKED at the Red Light District and i thought i actually aint a prude!!... 12pm lunch time and they are in the booths waiting for punters, by the third day of being in the city it felt \"Normal\" to see the girls in the window and not looking as sleazy as i had thought!!.... Majority of the girls had breast implants and hair extensions so they must be earning a bit lol. I actually felt quite sorry for the girls as some looked young and in there early twenty's especially when u see the amount of men that think they come out and throw thier hands up in victory!!..... Sad Sad Men!!...... Amsterdam was truly amazing from the canals to the coffee shops to the shopping and it is a truly beautiful city that i cant wait to return to in the summer it was freezing there. The staurday night got the Tram and went to The Supper Club which is a wicked experience YOU have to do this... after reading the people's reviews i was thinking hmm have i made the right choice!!, my friends had been previously and said i have to go!!. The trip was for my husbands 32nd birthday, and we went as a couple i think if you have an open mind and are able to enjoy it and hvave fun you are able to fuly experience Amsterdam at its best. Arrived at the club which is on Joeng Rostenburg not sure if thats the right spelling and it literally is a door which looks like a flat, we arrived inside and met by the host who was friendly and told us to goto the barwhich was downstairs, we put our coats in the cloakroom and then got drinks from the bar and went and sat on a double bed which was in a black padded leather room which had television's above the beds, here we waited to be called in to the restaurant. Once in the restaurant and showed to the huge sofa beds which had a small silver tray... this place was very chic and had an amazing experience. Our waitress Felic looked like Lady Gaga at the begining of thenight by the end of the night she had done several strip teas acts and looked like she was on a brazillian beach by the end of the night. The dinner per person is 70 eiro's each and that gives you entry to the club, we stayed here till 2am and was tired and very full after. Was given five courses and they were all cooked well and was hot. Really enjoyed the food but u go there for the experience it was truly amazing and strange but in a good way!... one to see i thought! got the night bus home which was 4.20 euro each and was right on the bridge at central station. Visited the Prix coffe shop which is a lot nicer than the other's that are about, leather sofas and seperate smoking rooms upstairs. Le place is great for lunch and was 12 euro's for two large rolls and real freshly squeezed juices..... excellent food and loads to choose from alot of locals were using this place to! Anne Frank's house was a really good experience and gave you an insight on how she must have felt is much better if you read the book as you can remember quotes from the book that are in the museum. 9 euro each. The bag museum i thought was good looking at the bags was more interesting than the actual information but was worth a visit. The flower market is beautiful and was really pretty to see. A visit to Casa Rosso a live sex show is a must it was not as bad as i thought very strange watching people have sex dont get me wrong but a funny night!... they do get people up from the audience it lasts an hour and a half and then just rotates back around. Get your tickets from the ticket and tour shop near the main square and the robabank and the rolex shop 47 euro per ticket which included four drinks. My whloe experience was truly amazing and i loved ebery minute of it.... i thought it was an amazing place and really funny people walking around stoned an thinking its normal with huge joints lol...... well funny to watch, everyone was happy there was no trouble in the town centre and had an amazing experience.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff", "Title": "\u201cThoroughly disappointing hotel\u201d", "Author": "VxM_12", "ReviewID": "UR122885227", "Content": "My boyfriend booked this hotel for a surprise visit to Amsterdam for us both and another couple in January 2012. Upon arrival we were told we could safely store our luggage until check-in in the luggage room. We were given a code to enter the room and told to leave our luggage there, however we all refused to do so as every individual who was either leaving or entering the hotel had access to this room. The room was unmanned and full of suitcases/bags. I did not relish the thought of some backpacker making off with my suitcase full of our clothes for the week, so refused to do this. The room the other couple stayed in was nice, however our room was horrendous. It felt seedy and unclean. There was a dirty mans handprint on the wall which is very off putting. Yet I do have to admit after going round the room with a handy wipe, it was clean in there. The carpet was full of dodgy looking stains and I actually refused to let my bare feet touch the carpet. The throw on the bed also had very suspicious stains on it. The Hem Hotel website is throughly misleading, my or there other couples room did not look anything like the pictures they have on there. It also states that most rooms have hairdryers, my room did intact have a hairdryer, the other couples did not. My hairdryer did not work however, and when we went downstairs to tell the receptionist it did not work, we were told in no uncertain terms that none of the hairdryers in the hotel worked and that we would have to pay a fee to rent one, but when we could rent one was unknown as all of them were taken and had no return time. Fabulous if you have long wet hair and have to walk round windy and rainy Amsterdam for 5 days! Luckily we managed to buy a hairdryer from a nearby 'Blokker' store. The hotel was fine for a few days stay where you only need somewhere to put your head, and it did just that. The website does not accurately represent what the hotel looks like, the standards, or the proximity. The hotel has also charged an unknown fee of 12 euros onto his bank card since we left. Upon check out we were told there we no outstanding charges, so why this charge has popped up now we are unsure. This hotel is fine if you just need somewhere to sleep. Some tips: leave your luggage at the central station luggage store (a lot safer and easier), take your own hair dryer, do not stay in room 107, and take some slippers for the dodgy carpet.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glyfada, Athens", "Title": "\u201cthank you Hem, you have made our trip memorable!\u201d", "Author": "nasosasos", "ReviewID": "UR122841572", "Content": "We stayed here for 5 days not willing to spend so much time in the hotel, although it was so accommodating.

The Hem has met all our expectations. It is located very close to the highways that lead to other major cities of the Netherlands, providing a free car park as well, which is quite rare in Amsterdam. Most of the times we used the tram since the stop was roughly five minutes on foot and with a pretty frequent service. Staff is very professional, smiling and helpful giving us all detailed information that we needed. The price we paid was equal of the hostels, so we felt so lucky that we booked this valued hotel instead!

It is outside of the city center, and if you are on a leisure holiday i would reccomend going slightly further in as it is a ten minute walk then a twenty five minute tram ride into Central Station. This is not a massive deal to me usually, but i went to amsterdam for the nightlife and trams stop at 12.30 at night so need to get a taxi back to the hotel and taxi prices are EXTORTIONATE. The rooms have been newly refurbished, and at first glance looked very nice and clean. After a closer look I could see that it was really not very well kept, the TV had no remote, nor did the air conditioning, the shower was hanging off the wall and the toilet flush was broken, the electricity was dodgey and every few hours we would have a blackout for a minute or too. The cleaner came in at half 8 both mornings, did a light tap then burst in the room, ignoring the 'do not disturb sign' and only left after i would scream 'NO'. But worst of all - bed bugs. I am completely covered head to toe in bites. The first morning i woke up with one itchy bite on my leg, thought nothing of it and carried on. The second morning i woke up with loads of bites! I would guess over 50 and thats being generous. They are everywhere all over my body! And as I stood up and started to itch, I could actually see the bugs crawling around on the bed, I found 7. I did report it to reception before leaving the hotel, and the woman seemed like she didnt really care, I was leaving and they just wanted me out rather than listen to what i had to say.

I highly recommend it. To put my stay in context: - I paid - Average of 40 Euros per night (including taxes) - Average of 7 Euros per night for Internet access (24 hours) - All comments below should be interpreted within the context above General impression: - Staff were very friendly - Guests were mostly young, but very quiet - Facilities were basic and worked well. You *will* get your money's worth!!! I liked the following: - The internet connection was OUTSTANDING! - Skype actually worked flawlessly! - I was able to download files at a constant rate of 200-300 kb/s - Toilet facilities were very good - Shower worked well, and had good pressure - Roomy - There was plenty of room for me, and it would have been easy to fit another person. - Bed was very comfortable - Temperature was easy to regulate - TV had English channels I disliked: - The front desk gave me an iron (20 Euro deposit to ensure I return it), but the iron did not work. They did not have a replacement. On the third night, they gave me a brand new iron (I took it out of the box). It was great... but I wish I had it earlier. - There was no ironing board - The internet connection didn't work on the last night (although I didn't confirm with the front desk). I didn't complain because the Internet connection was soooo good on the previous nights. Kudos to HEM! Transportation: - Hotel is only a 10 minute walk from the #50 metro. I used this every day. Public transportation is very good in Amsterdam, and there were plenty of ways to get to the hotel. - The area is very safe Possible \"Gotchas\" - This hotel has two distinct parts. I stayed in the newer (and more expensive) section (Note I only paid 40 Euros for my room). The older part is operated as a youth hostel. It is cheaper, but watch out. Those who complain about HEM must have stayed in the youth hostel, paid the lower price, and expected the higher service. I really recommend the \"regular\" hotel - where I stayed. - Breakfast is very expensive (15 Euros), so I never used it. However, remember this is a part of the hotel's operating model. So work accordingly. There is a grocery store within about 100 meters. - The hotel is right next to a very busy motorway (A10). My room actually faced the motorway. HOWEVER, the motorway has a sound barrier, and even with my window open, noise from the cars was very low. It worked out well for me, and I would easily take the same room again. - The hotel has good transportation, but it is somewhat far from the city center. Nevertheless, it is convenient. Here are my \"transportation\" times: - 10-minute walk to the Henk Sneevlietweg metro station. Some busses stop closer, but I just walked. - From Henk Sneevlietweg metro station, it takes about 20 minutes to get to Schiphol airport, or 15 minutes to Amsterdam Centraal. - I read the reviews on Trip Advisor and was somewhat worried, but all my doubts were quickly put to rest! - Most guests were tourists aged 18-35 years old. My stay was very quiet. Possibly others could have problems. I stayed for business, but I would happily stay as a tourist. Congratulations HEM hotel!

It included a large window which opened, a radiator which you could adjust the heat settings to, a TV (with free cable-we only discovered until the last few days of our holiday), multiple lamps around the room, four desks(including bedside tables), two leather chairs and two twin beds which were pushed together to create a double bed. In the bathroom there was a basin, a toilet, a shower, a hair-dryer and a plug for electrical razors. Everyday the water was hot in both the basin and the shower which was a relief as many reviews said there wasn't any hot water. We had paid for breakfast for everyday of our stay which consisted of an buffet of bread, jams, meats, cheese, beans, eggs, bacon, cereals, fruit, yoghurt and salad. Originally I was worried about this as I am a vegetarian and I know it is typical of Dutch breakfasts to have cold meats with bread but I helped myself to bread, beans, eggs and cereal which kept me full beyond lunchtime. Our room was cleaned daily; rubbish was removed from bins, the floor was hoovered,our bathroom was cleaned and our bedding was changed which made the room smell fresh again . There was a mix up at the beginning of our stay as Expedia had sent the hotel a receipt to say we had paid for 5 nights but we had actually paid for 6, I told the receptionist that night and I was told to come back in the morning to tell the manager. After thinking this was my fault I checked my emails on my phone and showed him my receipt and trip summary - after 9AM he called Expedia and everything was sorted. The only 'problem' with this hotel was that it was not in the centre but we had bought a 3 day travel pass for \u00c2\u00a315.50 that could be used on any of the trams, metro and buses for an unlimited amount and caught the tram to and from Dam Square. This was very quick but we ended up going past Vondelpark and lovely areas such as Prisengracht and Leidsplein which had shops and cafes to stop at and we felt less like British tourists travelling this way because we used a common method of transport without fiddling with maps. There are other passes available to buy on the tram, bus or at a metro station ranging from 1 to 100+ hours - this is cheaper than getting a taxi! Furthermore, you can rent bikes from the hotel if you have your credit card with you - however neither my boyfriend or I brought our cards with us so we could not do this although we would have loved to. Additionally, there is a map at the front of the hotel but I would bring one with you which shows the transport routes to help you. I used a miniature 'Eyewitness Travel' Amsterdam book which came with 3 foldaway maps including a transport route map for the trams - very useful I found. If you are stuck for things to do as you exit/enter the hotel you will find lots of leaflets such as the Van Gogh Museum, Rijksmuseum, Heineken Ice Bar etc. Lastly, as food in Amsterdam is very expensive I would advise going to Lidl which is nearby-google or ask reception for directions-or buy food from the large supermarket in Dam Square called Albert Heijn as this will make your money last longer! Overall, we loved Amsterdam and the Hem and will definitely be returning in the early Spring of 2012. I really hope this puts your mind at ease and you have as much as good stay as we did.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Narvik, Norway", "Title": "\u201cSave your money\u201d", "Author": "Furumoen", "ReviewID": "UR119184878", "Content": "If you can't afford any other hotel in Amsterdam then wait to go there until you can.

Secondly the pure filth in the hotel, lets start with the bathroom: 1. The shower had toe nail clippings in it when we first entered the room 2. The toilet smelt very strongly of urine even though it had been flushed several times. 3. The airconditoning was stuck and would not blow cold air. 4. The lights in the room kept going out and resulted in myself going to reception to get it sorted on several occasions. 5. The sheets had blood stains on them, we were in a four bed room and they were all stained. 6. There was bed bugs wandering across the sheets (could not miss is as the sheet are white) 7. Despite asking everyday during our 5 days stay our sheets were never changed, the beds were remaid using the same sheets (this was obvious as the blood stains on the sheets were in the exact same spot) the bed wasnt even made well the cover was just straightened, upon lifting the cover the sheet was still folded and creased in the same position i left it. 8. There was four of us staying but we were refused aditional room cards and had to share the one card. Lets go onto the staff: Upon our arrival at 11pm at night we made our way to reception where we stood for 10 minutes while the gentleman on reception finished his private phone call on his mobile phone, once he had finished we were given our room key, i asked if we could have extra keys and was told there was no way we could have another card even after i offered to pay a deposit for card and assured it would be returned safley. The cleaners that turn down the beds and room entered our room without knocking, when we left the room i made a point of asking the cleaner if they could change the sheets (this was the third day) as they werent changed the previous day and after huffing and ignoring me, i asked again and he agreed, this carried on for the full 5 days we were there, reception was informed everyday and failed to take action. Good points: 1. The food was good in the hotal resteraunt, even if the bar man did make us wait for 20 minutes before he served us. 2. The shower always had good water pressure and was alway hot.

It is withn walking distance of the Olympic stadium where the race started and finished - ideal considering the purpose of the trip The carpets in the public areas are worn/shabby but the rooms were clean, basic and comfortable The breakfast service was good and a wide range of food options available. The bathroom lacked comforts but it was clean and the shower was hot and powerful - ideal after 26 miles running When we stayed there were a lot of other runners there so maybe the clientele was a bit more respectable than usual ? I just think that a low priced hotel in any big city will have a contingent of shady charachters The staff were helpful and friendly", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "LukewarmCatastrophe", "Title": "\u201cNowhere near as bad as reviews suggest - but were we just lucky?\u201d", "Author": "LukewarmCatastrophe", "ReviewID": "UR83982314", "Content": "I always check Tripadvisor religiously before booking a hotel, and even though I'm open-minded enough to understand the phrase \"one mans trash is another mans treasure\", I still feel only a fool would ignore reviews which consistently refer to a hotel as \"smelling of mildew\" or \"having rude staff\" or being poorly located. In this instance, we were happy to run the risk of being fools, as we only paid \u00c2\u00a324.01 for our room for the night through the excellent eBookers website (first time I've used it!) and as we were only staying in Amsterdam for one night and had no time to explore the city centre and thus, didn't care about the location for sightseeing/drinking/eating etc, we felt it was a risk worth taking. Location: It is not in the city centre. This is made perfectly clear on the hotel's official website (where they also give excellent public transport information to assist you). Besides, most people in this day and age are perfectly capable of using Google maps, so anyone who complains about the location needs to research more. Service: We checked in at about 23.40 after a concert. We'd already called the hotel to discover what the latest possible time to check in was. It was midnight, so be careful if you have late flights or aren't able to get to the hotel during the day. Reception wasn't anything to write home about in terms of friendliness, it's true, but the guy certainly wasn't rude, just efficient and \"no-frills\". Fine by me, I didn't want a fireside chat with him! I did see a different receptionist be slightly condescending to some American arrivals shortly after we arrived but to be fair, they were being obnoxious and deserved it - I found it greatly entertaining ;) Food: Upon arriving to check in so close to midnight, we were worried there'd be no food available (and the area around the HEM has nothing in terms of nightlife/restaurants hell, there's barely a streetlight switched on!). I have to praise the EXCELLENT pizza we got from the food bar. It was really decent quality (looked hand-made with artichokes, sundried tomatoes, mushrooms etc) and very tasty. Just what we needed, and the guy that served it to us was really friendly and cheerful. There's also paninis and a fridge full of Ben and Jerry's, as well as a fully stocked bar for people who prefer a liquid supper! Rooms: There is apparently a \"hostel\" side to this establishment, and a \"hotel\" side. We were definitely in the hotel side. The two single beds, pushed together, were perfectly comfortable, the sheets were clean, the room was relatively spacious. We noticed a few odd things - like when we opened the curtains in the room, we were looking out into an internal part of the hotel, which can only be described as looking like a prison! Essentially, you had to keep your curtains closed to maintain your privacy in case anybody coming out of their \"prison doors\" happened to look up and see us in our room! This wasn't an issue, but it might have been if we'd planned on spending any length of time in the hotel and wanted to open the curtains to let in some light. I'll mention at this point that our bathroom did smell a little \"funny\" when we first arrived but really, this was nothing that a little bleach/toilet freshner wouldn't have fixed and it is a shame the hotel let itself down on this front. Everything else in the bathroom was fine. Clearly dated, but generally clean, with a properly flushing toilet, plenty of toilet paper, a powerful hot shower, etc To summarise - this hotel served our purposes perfectly fine. Bearing in mind the horror story reviews we had read, we were actually left feeling pleasantly surprised. I wouldn't stay here again if my stay in Amsterdam was for more than one night as it is too far out in the middle of nowhere to really enjoy and soak up the atmosphere of the city (and sadly, public transport after midnight is not good enough to take a risk on). However, if I was here for one night and found an excellent room rate like the one I took advantage of, I would strongly consider staying here again seeing as the rest of the hotels in Amsterdam were charging literally 3 times the price for something similar. A good budget option if you can use a map and are clever enough to visit the Tourist Information Office at Schiphol upon arrival and purchase one of the cheap, disposable public transport multi-use cards (Amsterdam's equivalent of London's \"Oyster card\" to make the metro/tram journeys which you'll need to make to get to this hotel.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "south wales", "Title": "\u201cAnd a good time was had by all\u201d", "Author": "welshlewis", "ReviewID": "UR82504903", "Content": "Hem Hotel has basic amenities and is situated on the outskirts of the city but it has clean, warm rooms with comfortable beds and an excellent breakfast.

Some of them stuck to the curtain and fell inside. We had to scout around and get them removed from the room. On reporting this to the front desk, they were not too concerned - they just mentioned that they would make a note of it, and inform the maintenance staff sometime!! 2. The staff during checkin mentioned that it parking charges would not be necessary as we are coming in so late, and leaving early. But on checkout, the person in the morning shift insisted that we had to pay. On being told that communication was different by his colleague on night shift, he did not budge. 3. The room is VERY basic. The carpets feel like they haven't been cleaned. 4. The bathroom floor does not have any bath-mats, and the flooring is VERY cold tiles - sends a shock through the feet whenever using the bathroom 5. The location is very shady - a walk to the nearest tram/station after sundown does not feel safe. And it is a bit of a walk. 6. There's always shady people hanging around the hotel. While I don't blame the hotel directly, it is probably of a profile which attracts such people. 7. Getting cuising taxis from this location is impossible. 8.

This brings me to the only good thing about the room, as opposed to other reviews, the shower was powerful and always hot, which after a long day was a blessing. However, once out of the shower you had to content with crap beds, not enough hangers, carpet that had a multitude of unmentionable stains, the symphony of door banging all through the night, and I mean all night, questionable characters hanging around in the hotel and the obvious drug deliveries and prostitutes turning up at all hours, day and night. The staff were colourful, some helpful and others with the attitude that would make the devil seem like a good chap. Getting a taxi was a battle every evening, partly due to the the conference in town but mostly due to the poor organisation from the hotel and the obvious taxi cartel that exists there. As mentioned in other reviews and also said by one of the taxi drivers I managed to get, after nearly getting beaten up by fellow guests attempting to steal it from me, was that the area was called the Bronx and was low class. Just walking around was enough to confirm this and the hookers, pimps and dealers at the local shopping centre would confirm this if you asked them.

(took us about an hour to get to the hotel from the airport) They let us drop off our luggage in the luggage storage room. You needed a code to get in, and the same code to lock it, but often people forgot so the door was unlocked when we got there. We left our bags and took the more valuable stuff with us to explore the city. Front desk was helpful and told us how to get into the heart of the city. You can take the #2 tram (5 minute walk from the hotel), it takes about 20 minutes to reach Dam square where a lot of stuff goes on. The trams stop running around 1230am before the night buses start running (which we didn't quite figure out) If you miss the last tram, it will cost about 35 euros to get back to the hotel from Dam. (too far to walk) Kind of sucked that we couldn't stay out too late. There is nothing around the hotel, so when you go back, you will just stay at the hotel. We were three guys so got a triple room. In Europe, this means a normal double room with an added bed, so there was not much space to move around or for our luggge. It was not a big deal since we were really in the room at night and went straight to sleep. The room was air conditioned which was a plus...took a while for the room to cool down. The second time we stayed there, we were placed in a quadruple room (we paid the same price). This room actually had 4 beds and a lot of room to walk around, but we didn't see air conditiong in this room. The bathrooms were fairly clean, but we weren't given soap or anything until we asked. Towels were given to us, and they had a closet full just down the hall and were able to grab a couple more if needed. The hotel has a restaurant on the main floor but you will be looking to spend almost 10 euros for a coffee and a croissant. This room also has a pinball machine and a pool table. They have a computer on the main level as well. You can purchase an internet access code at the front desk. Cost was 2.5 euros for 15 minutes....5 euros for 45 minutes. Usually it allowed you to stay on for an extra couple of minutes. Overall, not a bad hotel for the price we paid.

He looked around and told me someone would be with me shortly. 10 mins later and after lots of member's of staff had passed the door behind the bar and no-one entered to serve me, I decided to get a cold beer from the snack bar. Again no-one to serve me. I waited patiently for at least 5 mins, looking at two members of staff, intently in conversation, just a few feet away. Again I gave up, walked back to the tram stop (spitting feathers by now!) and made my way back into town for a drink. Great opportunity for Hem to make some extra money from me, wasted. And the Ugly... The area. This is a safe area but there is a particular building around the corner from the hotel (on route to the tram line) that does have groups of scary looking characters outside. In the two days I visited there was a group gathered most of the time. This does not seem to bother the locals (a local primary school had their children playing on a small open park, a few feet from this group, who were openly guzzling strong larger) so I tried to not let it bother me. I did however feel intimidated by one of them that took to following me back to the hotel, asking me for some money. He was clearly a junkie in the troughs of cold turkey, and became more desperate as he realised I was not interested. I was glad to be so close to the hotel entrance, but not a pleasant experience. Just for context, I grew up in Manchester city and I am not easily intimidated. Conclusion. The HEM hotel is a great value hotel, if you get if for the right price and follow the advice on Trip advisor. 1. Make sure when you book, you are booking the 3* Hem hotel and NOT its 2* Annex. 2. Ask for a room with a window (unless you don't mind an internal room) 3. If visiting for the first time, get on Google maps and check out the route from the tram to the hotel.

First of all they bungled our reservation, booking one room for 175 euro instead of two rooms for 198 euro (there was a 99 a piece promo). The error was probably due to problem between their system and the booking engine on the official tourism site of the city, but how is that my problem? After some back-and-forth discussions with hotel staff - they supposedly didn't have any rooms available, but fortunately I had a e-mail copy of the reservation confirmation - they managed to produce a key for the second room. At this point I reminded them that not only the number of rooms was wrong but also the price. The next day however they still decided to charge us 175 euro per room, pointing out that we didn't have any written proof that we were entitled to the promo. But the price was simply not mentioned on the reservation confirmation I received by mail, so how could I prove anything? After another annoying discussion hotel staff agreed to call management and ask permission to not charge us for the second room until they had the chance to contact the booking agency on Monday. This bureaucratic attitude where the customer is guilty until he can prove himself innocent - despite clear proof that there were problems with their booking engine/partners - caused a big waste of time in a short weekend trip. On top of that, the rooms are mediocre (the bathrooms just smelled) and it's not exactly conveniently located. So my advice, if you want to save some money and there's another promotion, you can take the risk. But there is NO WAY that this hotel is worth the 175 euro they claim for a standard room.

The same cannot be said for this hotel. I was on business and as most of the mainstream hotel were fully booked the travel agent booked me into this one. The Hem Hotel is situated in a run down suburb several miles from the centre - certainly not within walking distance. It has a very unimposing aspect as you enter, being slap bang next door to the elevated expressway which is noisy. The hotel itself appears to be prefabricated - like a row of portacabins stuck together. The lobby is crowded and centred around the main lift, which was out of order when I stayed. The rooms are cheaply constructed and fitted out. I would expect more than a bar of soap in the bathroom! The TV is old and most stations not available. No mini-bar or tea/coffee making facilities. The mattresses were foam and the pillows unforgiving. Although mine was a 'non-smoking' room, smoke pervades the place. Luckily I did not experience a view of the expressway -m just an internal area comprising old air-conditioning units. The cheapness of the construction means you can hear everything going on in the adjoining rooms and the hallway. So you get woken by revelers returning late into the night. For drinks and snacks there is a guy with what looks like a market stall in the lobby selling bottles of beer and crisps. At 3 Euro for a small bottle of water they are exploiting the fact that there are no shops in the vicinity. Not even sure if my rate included breakfast but I did not even try to go into what looked like a cafeteria. I just paid and left. 136 Euro a night (142 with tax) is a far too high a price to pay for this very basic hotel.

The rooms were clean and cosy, and were very quiet, which meant a great night's sleep. The breakfast was exceptional and with the tram stop only 5 minutes away with a direct route into the city centre, transport was not an issue - it was really convenient. (I suggest buying a travel card at the airport purely for convenience and as a means of avoiding hop on hop off bus trips which are expensive). On the second night things took a turn for the worse. We decided to eat in the restaurant (it had been great the night previously). The chef was completely stoned and as a result the whole experience was very Fawlty Towers. My sister had a tuna salad, which was tinned tuna which had not only not been drained- it could've been still swimming - but came additionally with the lid of the anchovy can - was this for decorative purposes or an aditional mineral supplement? My sandwich was dropped mid-delivery; the chef didn't notice and he proceded to man-handle the piece still on the plate, questioning whether I would like this exchanged! It was just so funny I thought we might die laughing. There is no kettle in the room and prices for a drink including tea and coffee start at 3 Euros, which is rather expensive if you are a huge coffee drinker like myself.

The hotel has a snack bar which is pretty pricey as you'd expect from a hotel - I'd suggest taking your own snacks and bringing drinks back as the snack bar is a bit of a rip off.

We were not the only people complaining about the loud music, and they were still more worried about the customers in the bar than the people trying to sleep. It wouldn't have been hard to just turn it down, they could still finish their drinks. It was flabbergasting.

The biggest let down to this hotel is probably its location. Glad we were a group of 4 because the walk from the main tram line to the hotel (about 5 mins) would be rather scary if you were a lone traveller. The hotel is bizarrely located behind a fire station in the middle of low rise flats forming a housing estate. However, once there form your own opinion. We arrived early and were told we could not check in until 2.00 pm. We knew this was standard terms but wanted to offload our luggage. We were advised that they had a luggage room close by to reception and were given a key code to the lock. However, the room was open and the lock didn't even work. Rather apprehensively we left our luggage there but removed all valuables. If anyone had wanted they could have gone in the room. (not good)!! After a short trip into town we returned to the hotel to find our luggage ok. Pheeeew!!! What a relief. Advise would be if you arrived in Amsterdam early like us to leave your luggage at the central station left luggage (7 euro's 45 cents) for 24 hour period. (far more secure) Then retrieve your luggage catch tram 2 outside station and off to hotel. The tram system is excellent. 7 euro for 24 hour pass gets you unlimited travel on public transport. Obtain tickets from central station. Back at the hotel once checked in - which was done politely and swiftly we were pleasantly surprised with our room. Clean, comfortable , nice bathroom, warm, large TV. and comfy bed, what more could you ask for? Just little things wrong - but nothing too drastic.

On returning for check-in, we were allocated a ground floor room and the walk through the cold, ugly corridor to get to it wasn't filling us with much hope of a decent room.

There was a decent sized TV, a useful tourist guide/book, but no tea/coffee facilities. The bathroom was clean with lots of hot water and a decent shower, although the towel rail/hooks could've done with tightening/replacing. The food at the hotel is excellent, much better than what we expected and reasonably priced. We ate there twice in the evenings, and can recommend the schnitzel and the steak! Breakfast was also great, lots of variety and decent food, plus tea, coffee & juices. There are a couple of supermarkets nearby plus other shops.

We were a little dubious prior to arriving after reading some nightmare reviews from people on trip advisor. We phoned the hotel prior to arrival to make it quite clear we would not be staying in the 'annexe' accomodation (recommend doing this!). We were allocated room 120 on the first floor. On arrival at the hotel (We hired a car) we parked up and went into reception, which looked very nice, all clean with a nice little snack bar off to one side. The lady on reception was very welcoming and helpful. On arrival in our room, the toilet flush was broken. My partner went down to reception to ask about repair. After an hour or so, a member of staff turned up (unsure of name, but he was tall with dark skin and short hair) he took one look and said it was fine (it wouldnt even flush!) we found him to be quite rude and unwilling to help, and asked to either have the toilet fixed or move rooms. After a bit of making it quite clear we were not happy, we were alloacted to another room, which was lovely and clean, and all in working order. However, in both rooms we had some mouldy mildew around the bathroom, due to a lack of extraction fan for the shower. The shower though was wonderful, lots of hot clean water and a nice strong blast after a cold day!!! On our first night we ate in the hotel. We both had a panini with a portion of chips each, which was fantastic, really tasty and not bad value at all, I think it came to about 20 euros for both of us including a drink each. The menu was good, with a fair bit of choice at a somewhat reasonable price compared to some of the restaurants in the city centre. We also had the breakfast every morning, which was lovely, nice and hot with a lot of choice - cant complain about the breakfast and bar staff, all very nice. We didnt use the little snack bar. There is a Lidl next to the hotel just under the bridge, which sells drinks and biscuity cakey things as well as fruit extremely cheap - perfect if youre off out for the day as drinks can cost upwards of 3-4 euros a time in the centre. The one thing that really disappointed us was that we had money go missing from the room during the day. My partner regularly travels abroad with work, and likes to leave a couple of euros (or equivalant) on the floor to see if they are taken or put on the side by honest staff. Unfortunately in the hem hotel, the money was taken, and I had some of my make up products and perfume used whilst we were out during the day. This is something we will be writing to the hem hotel about, as it is totally unacceptable. The location of the hotel wasnt too bad, the tram station was about 5 minutes walk. Once you get the hang of how to use the tram system, its really good. Its about a 15-20 minute ride to centraal station / dam square. Loads to do and see in the city centre, only thing id say to avoid is the extra cold ice bar, its a waste of money - very expensive for not a lot!!! The heineken experience is fanatastic, and a visit to ann franks house & a boat cruise were good too. Be careful of using the small pizza shops just outisde the red light district - there are no prices and the turkish owners make their prices up as they go along - there is one next to chikaaas that has prices which serves lovely snacks.

I will never attempt a 3 star again. The service, lobby, breakfast, food, location were all okay, but the room itself was disgusting.

Pro: - Nothing. Not even cheap. Neutral: - Breakfast, nothing fancy but does the job. Cons: - The room was not cleaned. They basically just make the bed and replace the towels in the bathroom, but as you can see on the pictures the bathroom is filthy. - Furniture in the bathroom was broken, see the attached photo. The light bulbs would flicker at random, I suspect the wiring is broken too. - The hotel uses a system where you leave your room key at the reception when you leave the building and get a \"keycard\" (a hand-written piece of paper) you later show to get the room key back. This system is obviously flawed as you could simply change the writing on the card or steal a blank card and fill it out. The staff works in three shifts so nobody knows if a keycard is legitimate. In the end the staff failed at their own system and would hand out the wrong key on multiple occasions, mostly because they couldn't read what their colleague wrote or they would interchange the digits and e.g. hand out room key 223 when you had room 323. - If you plan to rely on public transport for sightseeing choose a different hotel. HEM is located 10 minutes from the next stop and that one is only connected to a single tram line and a night bus. The tram line is number 2, one of the busiest lines (connects central station to the city center, the entertainment area and museums), and therefore quite unreliable most of the time. A single trip from HEM to the city center or the central station takes at least 30 minutes (the tram ride from the stop to central station alone takes 22 minutes according to the plan). Your public transport tickets will not be valid for the night bus, so be careful if you plan to return late or have to leave early. - Internet Access is extremely expensive, the \"cheapest\" offer being 35 euros for a week. - HEM \"polished\" their offer by excluding the city tax and including a 72 hour public transport ticket they didn't have. As an excuse the reception gave us the 30 euros for the ticket in cash but we had to return all the way to the central station to buy the ticket and lost a lot of time. - The hotel has only one elevator for \"normal\" customers - the second one only goes to the fourth floor. At our last day the elevator broke down and was not fixed, forcing us to carry our luggage over three stories the next day. - If you don't mind paying 11 euro for a simple pizza you can eat at the restaurant. - HEM built a second building that's connected to the main building via stairs and bridges. Ways around the buildings can be quite long depending on which room you got.

I did find that quite a few things in amsterdam are not cheap, but that has alot to do with the euro against the pound. not a good exchange rate at the moment and that does make the difference when you are buying.

Most people at the front desk spoke English fairly well (like everyone else in Amsterdam). They do not, however, know much the area--so don't expect to get any directions from them whatsoever.

The room was TINY: just enough room for two twin beds, but we did have the smallest room on the floor according to the map on the back of the door. The bathroom was about the same size as the room it seemed. For as much space as it had, though, it certainly had a lot of void area. There was only a shower, and the mirror in front of the sink was way too high to see in (but I'm pretty short). The location was not ideal. All of the main attractions were pretty far away -- the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum were both about 2 miles away, and Dam Square and the Anne Frank House even farther. We walked the distance several times but it was pretty tiring. There is, however, a tram stop (#2) at Westlandgracht stop, which was about 4 blocks away that connects to most of the attractions and Amsterdam Centraal Station. This gets a little expensive, though, because it is about 2 euro or more a person each ride (we were budget travelers). You can buy a Strippenkaart, however, which is a bus pass sort of thing, at kiosks, which I think is about 7 euro. There aren't really any restaurants or markets anywhere close to the hotel. There is, however, a cafe downstairs that has pretty good food (but is rather pricey - 6 to 8 euro for just a sandwich). There is also a computer downstairs that you can use for internet, but it is pricey too at 2.50 euro for 15 minutes, or 5 euro for 45 minutes.

At 23EU from the city center, it really starts to hurt after three nights.

We never waited more than 5 minutes or so, and the journey into town takes 10-15 mins and costs 2.40 for a single ticket. I would recommend buying a day/ weekend pass, or a strip ticket, to save money.

I booked it online and was just looking for something cheap for one night so 79 euro suited. My first impressions of the area were not good, the hotel was situated in a ghetto area surrounded by high rise flats and some undesirable locals as we found on a trip to the nearest shops. The man at reception who checked us in was friendly and wished us a pleasant stay. The room was basic as expected with 3 star hotel, within minutes of entering the room the children hopped upon the beds and my wife decided to open the window to let some air in, what she wasn't expecting was the complete window panel 6ft by 4ft to come crashing in on top of her, luckily whatever way it landed she avoided serious injury and thankfully the children had been sitting on the beds at the time as the 2 year old would most certainly have been seriously injured. I lifted the complete window frame off her then went to reception to complain, they apologised and moved us to the room next door but didn't seem to appreciate how serious the incident was. We were just glad to get our heads down after a lot of travelling. The next morning we found that the hot water wasn't working in the shower which was disappointing, however the real surprise came after checking out whilst awaiting the shuttle bus to the airport.

My initial impressions were that the place was somewhat dodgy. We were in the main building, not the annex, but it wasn't very nice. Furnishings in the lobby and hallways were worn and drab, and nothing seemed as though it had been thoroughly cleaned. The staff were not very forthcoming with details during check-in and they required an inordinate amount of personal information to register, which I did not feel entirely comfortable providing. You pay upfront for your stay, but I was checking my credit statement online for days afterwards to make sure that I hadn't been hit with any unexpected charges -- I guess that best describes what kind of place I thought it to be. To be fair, there were none. The room itself left a similar impression. The overhead light didn't work, and though the bathroom wasn't filthy there was some hair and dust to indicate that it hadn't been cleaned well. The furnishings and carpet were similar to the lobby, and the bed coverings were somewhat worn and unappealing. The actual bed was two single mattresses pushed together, which is fairly common in lower-end European hotels but the room had been advertised as a double. As to location and security; the hotel is not as short a journey from the center as it portends on its website, though the tram is just a 5 minute walk from the front door. It took about 20 minutes to get to the center, and the trams run frequently enough that it isn't a huge inconvenience. The neighborhood you must go through to get from the tram stop to the hotel isn't the nicest though; we were accosted rather aggressively for money by a disheveled-looking local while returning from drinks at the end of the night. Inside, the hotel requires that you leave your key at the desk when leaving, which might have caused some consternation if we had any valuables with us. As others have mentioned, the door locks are flimsy as well, and there are no safes or secure areas to store items while gone. In summary, the hotel was not to the standard that I expected, though it probably reflects the price more realistically than I had hoped. It wasn't a bad place to crash for an inexpensive night between flights, but it's also definitely not the 3 star hotel it is portrayed as on the internet, and it's not a place I'd stay at if I were to return for a longer visit.", "Date": "June 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central italy", "Title": "\u201cNot so good..\u201d", "Author": "europeanvistor", "ReviewID": "UR7605760", "Content": "The portacabin accommodation was very disappointing and overheated.

The reception and bar/restaurant area were modern and nicely decorated. The prices at the bar however were rather high (5 Euros per pint = approx \u00c2\u00a33.50!). Our room was clean, tidy and nicely decorated. I'm led to believe from others on our trip that the annex is not so nice so make sure you specify when you book where you want to stay. it's true what people are saying about differing prices depending on where you book.. we booked our room via BMIbaby together with our flight, in total it cost \u00c2\u00a380 each including our return flights & 2 nights B&B. However others on our trip were paying \u00c2\u00a340+ per night without breakfast! (which is, by the way, very nice and unlimited! :-D) As for the tram ride and distance from town, not a problem at all! The tram stop is maximum of 3 or 4 minutes away from the hotel (turn left out of reception, left at the gate, left at the fire station and at the end of that road just to the right is the tram stop) and the tram ride is very pleasant. Approx 10-15minutes ride to 'Liedseplein' which is the busiest area for resaurants and bars and another 5-10mins to Dam Square, the Red Light District & Central Station. It is possible to purchase a 24 hour unlimited tram ticket for just under 7 Euros from reception at the hotel... yes the trams do stop at midnight but are replaced by buses throughout the night (which is included on your ticket).

Breakfast is ok, bacon looks painfully thin anaemic and crinkled and the baked beans sauce taste's like bolognaise (not want you want first thing in the morning). The rest of food is adequate !! Only drank in hotel bar once as too expensive. 3 large beers and Vodka & coke 20 euro's ouch !!!! Went round to Lidl's (shopping complex round the corner from hotel) and bought a few alchohol supplies and left in room for late night drinks after catching last tram back to hotel. From central station to Westerlandgracht stop, it takes roughly 20 minutes, then a further 10 min walk to hotel from tram stop.

An experience to say the least. We also went on a canal cruise which was good. It worked out better for us to purchase a 72 hour tram ticket rather than the amsterdam card as we only went in 1 museum which was the Van Gough, and personally after spending an hour and half in that one, i didnt particluarly want to go to another - sorry to museum lovers, not my cup of tea!

There was no safe in the room and they did not have any safes that could fit laptops and in a sparse room it was hard to hide our valuables. The door had a very simple and weak lock.

Make sure that you book a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Standard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room as across from the main entrance there was something that resembled two mobile homes stacked on top of each other \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this must be the small/bad rooms people wrote about.

A WiFi signal was available for 10 Euros (US$13) per day, but was so slow and weak that I could not check my email. The hotel service directory said that they did not allow drugs in the hotel, but our hallway smelled of pot all of the time. Remember, soft drugs (pot, hash & mushrooms) are tolerated, but not technically legal! They really are a 5 minute walk from a tram/street car stop that made getting to the good stuff really easy (about a 10 minute street car ride). The street cars had a conductor (besides the driver) to sell you tickets and accepted bills as large as 50 Euros that made things really easy. The closest stop to the hotel was \u00e2\u20ac\u01532 zones\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or 2.40 Euros per trip. Your ticket is valid on all public transportation lines for an hour. The hotel was about a 15 minute drive from the airport (driving really fast) and cost us about 30 Euros. When we returned to the airport, the hotel arranged a cab for us that was only 25 Euros and the driver gave us a full receipt that included his name; very professional.

Did agree that 4 Euros per night for a safety box was a bit much but generally found amsterdam to be quite expensive though it's a beautiful canal strewn city.", "Date": "September 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bodoe, Norway", "Title": "\u201cWarning!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3791170", "Content": "This Hotel obviusly has a scam going on.
