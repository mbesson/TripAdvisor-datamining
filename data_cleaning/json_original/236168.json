The hotel is one block from bus and metro stations that can take you anywhere in the city for one euro.

The Hotel Gerber is a top notch hotel with a great staff and location. We stayed there 8 nights from Dec. 26 to Jan. 2rd. Check in was smooth and painless, and they had our room ready for us. We were on the top floor, with a balcony and access to a terrace with a table and 4 chairs. To begin your day, a breakfast consisting of a couple different kinds of bread, croissants, fresh fruit, three different types of juice, ham, sausage, cheese, cereal, and other assorted items on the breakfast table. The person running the breakfast, seeing to our every need, was Romeo. He is a friendly, well spoken person who loves to serve. We looked forward to seeing him every morning. Our room was cleaned daily and never felt dirty. There was ample space for the 4 of us, and beds were very comfortable. We were so busy, though, we never did check out the TV to any extent. It was turned on for 5 minutes one day. The staff always greeted us and acknowledged us, we felt like valued customers to them. Location is great - a short 1.5 block walk to the metro got us to whereever we wanted to go. We would typically walk to where we were going, then take the metro back. Exploring Rome on foot is something I would recommend to anyone able to do this. It as a short 15-20 miute walk to St. Peter's, the Vatican, and other places of interested. Our longest walk consisted of an hour walk to the Colosseum, with detours to the Spanish steps and Trevi Fountain. New Years eve we were suprised to see two small bottls of champagne in our room, with 4 wine glasses. It was very nice to be treated like this. Our checkout, even though it was 3:00 AM, was smooth and effecient. They called a taxi to take us to the airport, and it picked us up in less than 5 minutes. Peter runs a great, friendly hotel that has a wonderful staff, outstanding location, and everything you could ask for in a hotel.

I was pleasantly surprised and very much enjoyed my 5 night stay. I had a single room with a shared bathroom. This was not a problem at all. I had a sink and hairdryer n my room and the toilet/ shower room was very close by - if there was ever anyone else using it I never saw a trace of them. Everywhere was clean and comfortable, and the communal areas were relaxing places to be. The room had air conditioning, sky tv with news channels in multiple languages and pay per view movie channels. There was a balcony with table and chairs and for a charge of 1.50 euros you could have your breakfast delivered to your room. Breakfast was served downstairs between 7am and 9.30am: continental style with lots of variety and tasty food. You could stock up and not need lunch if that is what you wanted. Free wifi and a computer in one of the two downstairs lounges that you could use for 1 euro per half hour. Staff were always polite, attentive and willing to be of assistance. There was one old fashioned, cage style lift that I found very cute. I found the location to be very convenient. Metro station 2 min walk away - fare of 1 euro for any single stop. It is 15-20 min walk from the Vatican, and except one occasion when I got the metro to the colosseum I walked everywhere. I felt safe walking in the neighbourhood after dark - it is a middle class area away from the city centre and the hoards of tourists, on a side street with little passing traffic but still within 5 mins there were still many bars and eating establishments. The fact that there core customers were locals meant the food was cheaper and of a higher quality than anything I had in the centre of Rome. You really must try the pizza place and ice cream parlour just around the corner from the hotel - I went there because of a recommendation in The Rough Guide to Rome and was not disappointed.

I've been searching the web for a good hotel for almost one month and was quite afraid to book it relying only on reviews and not knowing what a hotel represents in reality. I always go to Marriott hotels becuase my friend gives me a friends and family rate and having stayed in Marrioot I was quite afraid to go to other hotel. In Rome, Marriott whcih our friend could reserve for me was quite faw away from the center and we decided to book a hotel online. So, after many hesitaions and investigations we decided in favor of Gerber and never regreted our decision. The hotel is very close to Vatican ( almost 15 minutes walking distance), very close to the subways station - Lepanto whicn is in the nearest corner and is just one stop away from Piazza Spagna. You could walk also in 5 minutes to Via Ottavio which has a lot of shops along the street and is very nice. As about the hotel, everyone wwas very helpful. Reception desk, the host who greeted us every day very warlmy during the breakfast, waiter adn housekeepers did their job very well. Triple room was very nice on the second floor ( I think Italsians call it the first floor), bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very clean and nice. In front of our room was a terrace with lemon trees. On 31 December, when we returned from New years' celebrations to our hotel we found a lovely surprise in our room - two bottle of champagne and chocolate. It's very important when you get to hotel after a tiring day to find yourself in a nice room with all the amenities.

It is in a more residential (less crowded) part of Rome, but easy to get to on the Metro. The Lepanto stop is less than 2 blocks away. We used our weeklong Metro pass (16 euros) several times a day for getting around. Our room was small, but clean. The TV was also small but had satellite channels so we could see some shows in English and even the US football playoffs in the middle of the night. Breakfast was in the basement but again the area was clean and well lit, and run by the friendly man mentioned in prior posts. It is a definite cost savings to have breakfast included. There is also a PC in the basement where you can check your email for 1 euro for an hour. Speaking of cost savings, we were able to get this hotel for 100 euros a night on a winter special they were having - tax and breakfast included. That definitely made the Hotel Gerber a place to recommend, especially if you are on a budget.

The front desk staff was helpful and friendly with basic English skills. They recommended an excellent restaurant just down the street - Pizzeria San Marco - where we had a great dinner during our last night in Rome. And there is a little pizza place right around the corner where you can grab a delicious slice of a wide variety of pizzas.

Briefly: The elevator is old, but works fine. The rooms are clean, quiet and adequate-I saw all 3. All were equally small but functional. The bathrooms are very modern and spotless, although the shower is built for a small person. (pretty typical here). There is a private courtyard, nice & inviting. There is a cozy rooftop with chairs & tables. The buffet is wonderful-everything you need as mentioned by earlier TA writeups. The staff makes sure that the items are replenished, along with more coffee or cappuccino. The eggs are in that usual in-between stage, neither hard or soft-boiled. (the only imperfect thing about this buffet). The man in charge of the buffet is very fussy though; we couldn't even put our tables together. And if there is a full house, he tends to discourage you from sticking around over coffee. He is efficient, we ended up referring to him as the \"Breakfast Nazi\". There is one computer, you can use your laptop. The pizza place down the street is very good and very busy-go early. Location is great as mentioned. Air conditioning worked fine in all 3 rms.

We were in a comfortable room during our first stay in Rome. The shower in the bathroom was a little small, but we expected small bathrooms in Rome. On our second stay, we had room 427, which was an improvement. This room had a small balcony and a bathtub - which we were delighted to see. It was one of the few rooms we had during our 24 day Europe trip that had a bath tub rather than a shower.

There is also a 4th floor balcony which offers privacy and a great view. We bought a Metro pass for the week and the Lepanto station is within one block of the Gerber. We walked everywhere when not on the Metro or the bus. Walking is the best way to see Rome and you will find lots of streets and sights on foot that you would not find on a bus or in a taxi. The neighborhood is very safe and quiet and we walked late at night without any concerns. There are many good restaurants close by and the gellato is a must! The rooms are small but very comfortable and offer a safe, and a small stocked refrigerator. Our room 427 had a small private balcony. Room 428 also has a balcony. Since this was our first trip to Rome, we did not know what to expect. We were delighted with the Gerber and will recommend it to our friends. It is also recommended by Rick Steve.

A welcoming receptionist checked us in as we looked over the lobby featuring a small bar and a large semi-circle couch with a circular table covered in newspapers and magazine for your reading pleasure. Up four marble steps and then a quick cram into the elevator that barely fits two people and two suticases but it gets you where you need to go with no problems. Our double-bed room was amazingly clean complete with desk, small TV and fridge. A cabinet provides space to hang our clothes or slide them into drawers. An easy to use security box allowed me to dump off my passports and extra cash. there was also a large window that can be opened. The bathroom was clean with a couple of crisp white towels for the face and others for the shower. Although I am a private bathroom kind of guy, I would have opted for a shared bathroom because of the cleanliness throughout the hotel. Other ammenities included a fourth-floor balcony to just hang out and watch the sun set as well as a small courtyard area with tables and chairs. The best part was the sleep. No trucks and car alarms as you find around the downtown Rome hotels. Brekfast--Fantastic. Coffee, water, cereal, milk, juice, cheese, bread, hard boiled eggs and fruit. All served by some nice folks who like to talk and can help point the ways to different places if there are any questions. Don't forget breakfast is included in hte hotel cost. Hotel Gerber was a 15-minute ride out from the Rome train station on the Metro which is great because then you are right in the middle of everything you need to be for the rest of the trip. Two stops to the Vatican, one stop to the Spanish Steps, two to the Trevi Fountain and the heart of Rome's eating area. The only caution is that if the Metro closes you may have to rely on the buses which work well. A taxi ride is less than $10 Euros if you are ever stuck.
