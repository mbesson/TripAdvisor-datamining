{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very good for the price... In spite of the reviews, this is actually quite a good hotel. The majority of the chain hotels in Frankfurt are in the Bahnhofsviertel, which is fine, if thats where you want to be and want to walk through the Red Light District for dinner. This hotel is situated about 5 minutes walk along a main street from the Zeil which I think makes it a fantastic location on the eastern side of the city centre.At the beginning of the Zeil is the Konstablerwache U-Bahn station which makes it easy to get to the airport/Wiesbaden etc. I also think that one of it's selling points is being able to walk over the river into Sachsenhausen of an evening!Check-in staff were helpful with directions etc (all speaking english), and a fax that I had to send. We had booked a special deal for one of the top floor rooms, and this was an average room that perfectly suited its purpose of a 1 night stay. The American Bar is also a great place in the evenings!I am not sure if I would pay the prices for the 'better' rooms here, solely because the hotel is only 3*. It's not somewhere that I would book to impress. However, check the Steigenberger website for special deals, there is generally some if you book ahead.", "Date": "Jan 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR414977157", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mrbaggers"}, {"Content": "unfriendly desk clerk My wife and I stayed at the hotel from 22 to 30 November 2007 and again from 8 to 10 December 2007. During our first stay in november we had only one problem, room not properly cleaned and dirty glasses not replaced. This was reported to the front desk TWICE before any action was taken. Otherwise our stay was very pleasanrt and the staff were friendly and hlepful.The hotel advertises on their website, and in their general brochure in the room, that they provide a luggage service. This was very important to me as I had major back surgery this year and was not able to handle any heavy luggage. I took this into account when I made my reservation. During our November stay we had excellent assistance ffrom the staff and there was no problem when we asked for assistance with our luggage.Even when we checked in for our second stay on 8th December, after returning from Munich,we were assisted with our luggage. However, when I called the desk for assistance, as we were checking out on 10 December (also our last stay of a very memorable 18 day stay in Germany), I was told by the desk clerk, a Herr Hennemann, that the hotel does not provide a luggage service and that I would have to collect the trolleys in the foyer and move our lugagge on ourselves. I pointed out to him that I have a back problem and that the hotel brochure and the internet website stated that a luggage service is available, he told me that this information was incorrect and I would have to do the luggage myself.I went down to the front desk and showed him the hotel brochure where it clearly states luggage service provided but he still would not budge and insisted that it was a printing error. I told him that, due to my back problem, I would never have booked the hotel if they did not provide this service and also referred to my previous stay at the hotel in November where we were assisted without any problem. I had booked this hotel because I had stayed there on a previous occasion in 2005 without any problems.I then asked herr Hennemann for the trolleys, which he had to go look for as they were not in the foyer as he had stated. His attitude was also not becoming of a hotel employee and his manner of telling me about the luggage was totally unacceptable. I put this to him very strongly and also told him that I would lodge a written complaint with the hotel and the Germany Embassy in Cape Town.When he eventually returned with the ttrolleys he offerred to help us but I refused bacause of his totally unacceptable attitude and told him that we did not want any special favours from him. He told me that he had checked with his manager who confirmed that the hotel does not provide a luggage service.My contention is that they should not advertise services, on their website and in-house brochure, that they know they do not provide! Or is herr Hennemann making his own rules for the hotel without the knowledge of management and those who are responsible for advertising?This incident was really a sour ending to a lovely 18 day holiday in Germany and herr Hennemann was the only hotel employee who treated us in this manner during our entire trip.John  Agatha ThomasCape Town South Africa", "Date": "Dec 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR140156300", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "moorcres"}, {"Content": "OK hotel, lovely food, dodgy location Ok - for the postivie sides of this hotel: the food at the restaurant,although a wee bit pricey was just delicious. the breakfast was also pretty good. onsite parking available, although expensive, and location was very close to the centre, although in a dodgier area.

The food offered on the buffet breakfast is good and worth the cost for us.Now, the not so good. This hotel mentions that it has a gym but it is a complete joke. Almost completely unusable as most of the equipment is old and dis-functional. The bad part of location is that it is not at all close to the U-bahn. It is roughly equal distance between two stations but not at all close. There is a trolley that runs along the road and my room did face that road. That noise did not bother me but the noise from drunks returning from their evening out did.Finally, I had some cleaning done by the hotel. I was missing one item and mentioned it to the staff.

The hotel has a very late check in so when we arrived at 1.30 our rooms were still not ready and we had a wait of nearly an hour before getting into them.

We went out while they sorted it and on our return were given exactly the same room!! In the end we were given what appeared to be a disabled double room on the ground floor, where half the bed had been moved over to the other side of the room (away from the bedside table and light) to look like a twin room.
