Once we were there, however, there were no issues with check in or our room.The one-bedroom room is nicely updated with two televisions (one in the living area that has cable channels, and one in the bedroom with the usual five stations). The dining area was nice, and we had a Juliet balcony that overlooked a snippet of Hyde Park (mostly other buildings, however). The kitchen is quite small -- there is a microwave and two cooktop elements, and a small fridge. Toaster and kettle were also included.There was not a freezer, oven, dishwasher or washer/dryer. Laundriesare available in the apartments on floors 3, 7, 11 and 15. I didn't feel like carting dirty laundry up and down floors, so did not use. The kitchen is outfitted with utensils, dishes and the like, but I was less than impressed with the cleanliness of the cookery, and scalded everything before using.It appears as if the new owners are going to be selling some of the apartments as timeshared units. All in all, the location is nice (we were able to walk into the city, to Central Railway and Town Hall, and also to the Sydney Cricket Ground, but all were a bit of a walk...FYI), the rooms were clean for the most part, and the conveniences were quite good for the $140 AUD average per night we stayed.", "Date": "Jun 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR817645995", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "blueflier"}, {"Content": "Sun standard at Trendwest Suites, Sydney During a month long trip to Aussie I have to say that this hotel was a real low in the holiday. The rooms had been recently refurbished are were okay but the staff and the standard of cleaning let the whole place down. There are limited laundry facilities with one washing machine and dryer on level 5 and another on level 7. I spent literally hours racing around trying to get laundry done with washing in a machine on one level and drying on another level and to make matters worse only 1 lift working!! Racing up and down the fire exit staircase was a welcome workout as the hotel advertised a gym but didn't provide one!!! A couple of the staff were extremely rude - I would give this one a miss if I were to go again.", "Date": "May 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR537441787", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "KarenfromTod"}, {"Content": "We were really happy with Trendwest Suites We wanted a suite hotel for our 6 night stay in Sydney at the end of 3 months away - needed some space! I was a little concerned with some of the earlier reviews here on Trip Advisor but most of the complaints had to do with construction noise so I went ahead and booked.We were really happy with our accommodation - although we did ask to be moved to a higher floor due to ground floor construction noise (which is almost done) - our suite was great - a very functional kitchen (the addition of a plunge coffee pot would have been even perfect but they claim they're coming - in the meantime they supply instant coffee and there is a kettle, big toaster, microwave, 2 electric burners and a frig). A flat panel TV in the bedroom and living room; hi speed internet (for a fee). We used the laundry facilities several times and never had a problem with availability.We liked Sydney so much we rearranged our schedule and returned to the hotel for 3 additional nights.The location was great for us - we walked to Darling Harbour, the Opera House, etc and a cab ride back was reasonable.Front Desk Staff was helpful - we checked our bags there for 5 nights when we went to Cairns for a dive liveaboard - all was well upon our return.For the price ($160US and $195US for our two different stays) and the facilities and the location - it's a great bargain for Sydney, I think", "Date": "Apr 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR509680901", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ElizabethS"}, {"Content": "impressed Stayed at the Trendwest Suites in February for 5 nights and sometime you think wish I had not read reveiws due to some negitive comments.

There was also a double shower which we prefer to a bath any day. There was a laundry room on our floor which was excellent. Nearby was plenty of eating places. The location was excellent as well.

I was very impressed with the Trendwest Suites. I first stayed in a studio suite for four days and then in a one bedroom apartment for a further 8 days. The rooms were fully refurbished, clean and very comfortable, especially the beds! The only problem was the renovation that was going on, which could be a little noisy first thing in the morning, but that's almost finished.On all occasions the staff were friendly and helpful and booked several trips and flights for me. The telephone line in the first room I stayed in did not work, so the hotel kindly let me use their broadband connection free of charge.It is a shame the STC bistro isn't open for dinner, as the breakfasts are good and the staff very friendly.

The bathroom was off the bedroom, and quite large, although there was no bath.The front reception was quite small and had not been refurbished (I guess that they are still getting to that), but the staff were quite helpful. We did have to ask twice for towels (after housekeeping came the second day and took the old ones without replacing them), but they were very apologetic and brought them up straight away.The hotel is in a great location - between the CBD and Surry Hills.

Accommodation is spacious - we had two-bedroom apartment with two bathrooms for four adults - and it is very well situated. We walked everywhere. However, we shared our floor (16th) with the site office for the re-fit work. Work started early , about 7 a.m. but didn't really distrurb us. It felt like a buliding site as soon as we went out on to the landing from our room. The accommodation had a dog-eared feel, especially furniture. The main problem was the fact that we were cold - air-con controls were unresponsive - we had to put on a hot-plate in the kitchen area to warm ourselves up first thing in morning and last thing in the evening. On our last morning, we discovered that the lifts weren't working and had to manhandle all our luggage down 16 storeys of concrete service stairs to ensure we didn't miss the airport shuttle.

I paid \u62e249 a night, which is less than you would pay for Premier Lodge or Travel Lodge in the UK. For this you get a I bedroom apartment. The rooms had basic amount of furniture which would appear to be the original items form when the building opened ie about 8 years old.The hotel is currently undergoing a refurb, and I did have a look at the completed rooms. I have to say they looked a bit better than ours as it was all new, but it really was a paint job and up to date chrome microwave and kitchen stuff rather than white but thats all.The hotel is located in a excellent position to get around. Easy for CBD, Chinatown and the Central Station and Gay district if thats your thing.The staff were helpful, thought to be honest we didnt really need their help to get round Sydney as it is easy to navigate. We didn't have a problem with road noise as our room was 8 floors up and our bedoom didn't face on to the roads (room 839 or 836 i can't remember) . I would guess that if you had a front facing room it might be noiser, but you are in a city centre so that has to be expected. The gym was not open at the time, as it was on a floor that was being refitted, thought i did sneek a peek, and found it consisted of a cross trainer ,cycle and running mill and shower. I don't think you would want to share the gym as it was so small. The picture on the web site I think relate to the old gym, which is now the contracter's work office on floor 13.The only gripe we had was the fact the TV was broken, and took two days to repair. Apparently, as part of the refurb digital TV is being installed and they are having teething problems with it. I would not say the place was 4 star but more like 3 star but for less than \u62e250 a night for a room thats good value. Other than that we found the room spacious, clean and suitable for most people. I would have no problem recommending this place to stay in. I would warm any guest staying that the premises is being refited and the builder 's tend to start work at 8.30am, but this didn't intrude in our stay. If ,however, you like you like to sleep in late, this may not be suitable for you.I hope you find this review useful and enjoy any stay you may have here and in Sydney.", "Date": "Jul 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR540593735", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "GraeHo"}, {"Content": "Mixed Feelings The good:Great location, just around the corner from Hyde Park. Can walk to Oxford Street if the bar scene is your thing. Convenient store right next door, shopping areas and Chinatown within walking distance. Nice Spacious rooms, even has a decently equippied kitchen with tools, pot pans, utensils and china. The kitchen is probably the best thing about the room, it's more like being in a one bedroom apartment, so if you are here for a long time then it's more homely than a normal hotel room. Having a living room is great for having guests over. Bathroom is a good size, nice and clean looking and got all the things you need and more. The Bad:The bed is the most uncomfortable I have slept on in god-knows-how-long. Just couldn't get a good night sleep at all. Super flat pillows and paper thin comforter didn't help. Temperature in room was impossible to control, actually don't even know if the Thermostat really worked, it didn't seem to make a difference what I turned it to. TV worked ok at the beginning but one day just didn't work anymore, asked the reception and they said it would take 2 days before I get it back. Had 2 fire alarms during the one week I was there, around 5-6 pm both times. The staff seemed to think it was quite normal I wonder if this is a frequent occurrence here. No internet, not even if you want to pay extra charges. The rooms here just aren't equipped with cable or DSL. Had to walk 2 blocks to a decent internet cafe. Tried stealing people's bandwidths on wi-fi but no success in this building. Overall: Not bad.... don't know if I would come back the very next time. Might have to try out 1 or 2 other places first to see if there are better places out there for the same price. Don't think it would be impossible if you look hard enough. But otherwise it is not a completely bad place to settle for if you think the price is good because at least the location is very ideal, and the space is good for long stay.", "Date": "Jun 7, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR114999108", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "tempest26"}, {"Content": "Excellent Location We had known beforehand that the hotel was undergoing a refit, so were not worried about the occasional noise.
