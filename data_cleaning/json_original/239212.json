The hotel is on a small street (Via Mario De Fiori) very close to the Spanish Steps. We had a superior double, which was a nice sized room and bathroom (with Jacuzzi tub). Bed was comfy and there was a desk and extra chair for lounging. Room also had a small refrigerator with coke, beer and wine for about 8 euros each. Room was all the way at the top of the stair, but there is a small elevator that will accommodate one person at a time with luggage. The hotel offered free internet, but you'll need an ethernet cable, as it's not wireless. They have extra cables at the front desk they they lend out for no charge. Front desk staff were very nice. One of the ladies spoke 6 different languages (italian, spanish, french, english, german, and russian). They all speak fluent english, so there was no language problem. Our room faced Mario De Fiori, which is quite during the morning before the restaurants open. From about 11am to 11pm you can here the chatter of dishes, the crowds, and street musicians. This was not a bad thing, we enjoyed the action. The free breakfast included european cereals, yogurt, cheeses and meats, rolls, coffee and juices. It's not exactly what you would have in America, but this is Rome. Ladies that set up the breakfast are very nice. It's very close to the Spanish Steps, Villa Borgese, and the Metro, and within walking distance to all the other attractions. We walked the entire city and this is very easy and great way to experience Rome. There are several restaurants on Mario De Fiore, but they are very pricey by American standards. The most reasonable place we found was called Fior Fiore which is on Via Della Croce right around the corner.

You find something, think the location is brilliant, all sounds positive until you read the reviews telling you to stay well away! With my flights to Rome booked, it took an extra month to find a decent sounding hotel. Having been to Rome before I knew that I wanted to stay in the Historical/Medievel quarter, which is exactly where the Piazza Di Spagna is. The taxi driver dropped us off in the rain at The Pantheon and told us that it was just around the corner, who knows why he couldnt take us to the door as this is where we were collected from. Its not hard to find, but it was raining and on a Friday night, the streets were busy. Hotel Piaza Di Spagna is on a gorgeous cobbled street bustling with several restaurants, ivy covered walls and very typical of what you'd expect a narrow street in Old Rome would look like. The staff were fantastic and couldnt be more helpful, they recommend local eateries, helped with directions and booked us a taxi for the journey back. Our room was very sweet and traditional looking and very comfortable. Who cares if there may have been a tad of peeling wallpaper or a limscale stain, does this really ruin your stay? The bathroom had a large bath with jacuzzi jets - perfect for relaxing in after a long day. Both the room and bathroom were large and the shutters kept out the majority of noise and enabled a great night sleep (comfy bed too). Both were very clean and neat. Breakfast was very basic, but did the job. A selection of cakes, slices of baguette, cheese plate, ham, cereals and fruit. Perfect continental combination. You can either sit in the small room off of the kitchen (about 12 seats, but it wasnt ever full) or the outside courtyard. The location was great and within walking distance of everywhere with fabulous boutiques locally. There wasn't anything I disliked about the hotel and wouldn't hesitate to stay again or recommend to friends. You have to take all reviews with 'a pinch of salt' and not be worried about silly little comments which would not alter the important things like location or service.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cBeware\u201d", "Author": "ironman01", "ReviewID": "UR104992780", "Content": "I had a very bad experience with the this hotel that I want to share with you. I was booked to stay at the hotel for 3 nights in May 2011. Unfortunately I had a fall at home prior to setting out on my vacation and I shattered my knee cap. This required surgery and meant that I had to cancel my Italy holiday. My wife called the hotel on the day of my fall, when I was in emergency at the hospital (it was 17 April) and advised them that we needed to cancel our trip because of these very unfortunate circumstances. We were told that they needed the approval of their manager, Simona, prior to processing our request. After exchanges of emails, Simona advised that they could not refund any part of the booking as it had been done as part of a discounted offer. Then on 21 April the hotel proceeded to charge my credit card with the full expense. So.....here is the thing....despite calling them as soon as possible on 17 April so as to give them a chance to use the room for another customer.....despite the fact that I was the victim of an accident.....Simona and the hotel still went ahead and charged my credit card on 21 April. The best I can say is that these people (Simona) have no compassion. The worst I can say is that they are dishonest choosing to process the credit card expense 5 days after they were advised of my problems. The strange thing is that the hotels we booked in Venice and Florence were totally understanding with one making a refund and the other, who like Hotel Piazza di Spagna, had not processed the credit card expense, choosing to not process the expense. I am a great believer in karma...particularly as you travel the world and share good times and sometimes bad times with fellow travelers. I try to be fair and reasonable.

And in this charming and welcoming hotel, minutes away from the Piazza di Spagna, we could do all that and more. I've stayed here a couple of times because the rooms 'feel' very Italian (even the sheets 'feel' Italian) and to my relief when you close those shutters the room is gloriously dark and quiet ( even if outside the Roman streets are bustling). The rooms I have stayed in are not large, but when in Rome you want to see Rome, so returning to a really comfortable bed with a great shower is all we needed. I travelled with my 12 year old daughter and she really loved staying there. Watching Italian TV game shows was a real insight ! And the quiet was very condusive to the 'compulsory' reading on the bed in the late afternoon, before we ventured out for a gelato and a stroll in the evening.And stroll we did....because the hotel is close to everywhere and everything.

Location - Good Location near Spanish Steps. We were able to walk everywhere (Vatican City, Colosseum, Navona Square) without a problem. Hotel is on a street that has low traffic volume but this was an issue for us because we were on the first floor. We could hear lots of activity outside early in the morning. Room/Bathroom - We had a room with standard bed on first floor. Small room but I think this is common is Rome. Bed (queen bed) was fairly comfortable. Room had safe and mini fridge for use with no extra charge. No balcony but windows opened and gave you nice view of street. As mentioned above, we could hear lots of noise early in the morning so a room higher up or away from the street might be better. Furnishings were classic Italy style and looked updated as indicated on their website. Bathroom was very small which was ok but a bigger shower would have been nice. Service - Above average service. Hotel employees were very nice and accommodating. Although we did try to switch rooms after the first night without success because they were full.

Kids of all ages love it here and the Italians seem to treat children very well......
