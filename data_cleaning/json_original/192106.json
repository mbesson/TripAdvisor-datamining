I was sorely disappointed. The sheets were clean, there was a generous supply of clean towels, the bed very comfortable, more than adequate milk cartons (something hotels are usually very mean on) and the staff were, without exception, helpful and friendly. There was always a smile for you upon returning to the hotel. Upon arrival, a young man was summoned to carry my small suitcase up to my room - an old fashioned practice not found in some more expensive hotel. It is true the carpet was worn in places and the paintwork has seen better days. There appears to be some renovation taking place in the area of one of the main staircases as modern wood panelling had been placed on the lower part of the walls. This was, I fear, a mistake and out of keeping in a town house such as the Rose Court. The restoration and decoration of these elegant houses, even when used as hotels, needs to be researched. The hotel appears to lack a housekeeper and a DIY man. Traditionally, the housekeeper's job was to check each room, etc. for any fault (however slight) and get it fixed (this is where the DIY man came in). In my room, the housekeeper would have found the basin plug did not fit and that some wretched child, upon entering the room, had left their sticky finger marks on the wall . I would think these two jobs could be absorbed by the current staff. The small lounge had a supply of tourist leaflets, large TV and two comfortable settees. Some magazines would have been nice. They do not have to be up-to-date or expensive - just something to while away a short time. Some fresh or potted flowers would have been nice. Again these do not have to be expensive. The dining room could have been the original dining room and had two large windows which made the room quite light. The basic breakfast was included in the price. However, a cooked breakfst was available for an extra charge. The UK and London in particular is now expensive and the cost of maintaining these town houses is high. People seem to forget that the bill they pay is not the hotel's own turnover. There is VAT at 17 1/2% and the business rate. I suspect that, of the \u00c2\u00a375 I paid, the hotel received maybe \u00c2\u00a360. Then there is the burden of implementing the never ending legislation which now emanates from the EU . This always includes a healthy dose of paperwork which nobody ever looks at.

As I opened the room door I was prepared for the worst and so it was. The room was an unusual shape, longish and narrow. The wallpaper was dull and ancient. My attention was then immediately drawn to the bed. The blanket was very old and dirty looking, as was the headboard. There was an old wardrobe at the foot of the bed which looked like it was ready to fall over at any moment. The room had a real dark and depressing feel to it. I had a quick glimpse into the bathroom which was bigger than the room itself before I decided to go back and investigate the sheets on the bed. As I pulled back the old top blanket the sheets underneath surprisingly looked cleaned but then the lights went out and I was in the dark. Maybe that was the best way to view the room.

The room my partner and I stayed in was surprisingly large with high ceilings and a big window, and so has the potential to be really lovely. Unfortunately though the decor and general state of repair let it down. I'm not sure of the room number, but our room had a large mirror right opposite the bed, which was really disconcerting and gave you the feeling of being watched which wasn't pleasant. There was a double bed in the room and an extra single, the bedlinen was clean but looked old and the bed was incredibly uncomfortable and creaked every time you moved, making it near impossible to sleep. I tried sleeping in the single and it was the same. The en suite was very small, but I expect that for the price and it was no problem for us. It was quite grubby though and the whole place could do with a refresh. The final test of a good hotel is always the tea and coffee making facilities, but they provided whitening instead of milk and the kettle wasn't clean, so we didn't go there! We didn't want to stay for breakfast and when we met up with my colleague in the morning, she was equally unimpressed and had left her room at 6.30am because she didn't feel comfortable there.

It was a bit shabby, and definitely cramped quarters, but we were literally using the place to hold our stuff, shower and sleep. And it did well for all those things. The beds are hard, I agree, although I've heard that hard beds are better for your back. I still like softer beds.

There is no AC,but it was so nice and cool out we just opened the window and got a wonderful breeze. The bathroom was so tiny. Smaller then my NYC apartment bathroom. The shower was a little grimy but i'm young and don't complain. I showered. The sink made me laugh every time i saw it, because it was so tiny. Also the door lock was fun because the hole would be green or red (depending on if someone was in there or not) The tv had 5 stations. BBC all the way. The breakfast was fine. England coffee sucks...good luck finding good coffee anywhere in that country. The toast was really good, as was the jam. Cereal was good. Wasn't a fan of the eggs and beans but I know that is their culture to eat that kind of food so I will not complain, but be happy I could try something that wasn't american.
