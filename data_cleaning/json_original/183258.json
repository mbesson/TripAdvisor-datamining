My favorite hotel for many years was the Ritz Carlton and I continued to stay there even after it began a long period of decline. (The totally rebuilt Ritz Carlton on a reduced scale will be back in operation soon.) In the scramble to find a new home-away-from-home, I have tried over recent years many alternatives, but the best I have found is the Loews Hotel Vogue. It's well-situated in \"my\" part of town, by that I mean in close proximity to Ste. Catherine Street (Montreal's main or high street), Sherbrooke Street (with its collection of art dealers, fine clothing shops, and museums, as well as McGill University and near-by Concordia University), and the multitude of shops and restaurants located on many of the side streets. It overlooks the former Jas. Ogilvy Department Store which in recent years has been home to a substantial collection of high-end boutique shops. (People wanting to be in the heart of \"Old Montreal\" will, however, find it a bit of a commute.) The hotel is small, which in my estimation adds to its appeal. The staff is abundant and very pleasant. The rooms I have been given have been very spacious, tastefully decorated and well-maintained. The bathrooms have also been very spacious with lots of marble and both a whirlpool bath and a shower. The lobby is small but with an attractive eating and drinking area.

I corresponded with one of the Concierge's, Caro, months before - asking for restaurant and sightseeing recommendations, and she was most helpful. I mentioned our affection for the Loews Coronado, and sent her a couple of photos of our family with the 3 doggies. What did we find when we checked into our lovely, upgraded room when we arrived? My photos had been printed out from the email, and framed, placed on our room vanity table with a note from Caro, welcoming us. Now that is above and beyond the duties of a concierge!!!!!!!!!! They were so accommodating and helpful in every way - from the doormen and bellmen, to the front desk and room service waiters. The location is great.

We are walkers, and had no trouble walking to Vieux Montreal as well as up to the Mont Royal area. The hotel is easily accessible by Metro as well. Our room was very large and very comfortable - the bathroom was also very large and beautiful, with nice large and heavy towels, and terry lined robes. While we did not take anything from the minibar, we did use the little fridge for some of our own things like water, apples, etc with no issue. There is a Keurig coffee maker in the room, with unlimited coffee pods, creamers, and sweetners, which I loved! I could have my coffee in the morning and another one later in the day if I wanted. The curtains enabled us to make the room very dark at night, which I appreciate. The lobby is very tastefully decorated and there is always a bowl of fruit and later something cold to drink. Since I did not want to pay the fee for internet in my room, I used the lobby computers frequently with no hassle at all. I never had to wait and no-one ever was waiting for me to get off. We both used the fitness center and enjoyed the fact that they have a supply of earphones to use on the tv each machine has, free bottled water, apples, and towels. Probably the best part of this hotel is the personalized service we received. From the moment we pulled up, the staff greeted us warmly and graciously. Each time we came in and out of the hotel, they addressed us by name and we chatted with them about how our day went, where we were going to eat, etc. It truly was a lovely and homey touch to an elegant hotel. My only complaint is that every morning at about 6:00 am we heard trucks (maybe garbage trucks) for about 5 minutes or so, and then it would get quiet again. We were facing the back of the hotel and I don't know if it would be quieter facing the street in the front. It is almost impossible for a city hotel to block all street noises, so I am not sure this would be better anywhere else. Otherwise, we found our room to be very quiet. The restaurant was closed, but they were providing a limited breakfast menu in the bar area. We saw it was very expensive and found 2 excellent restaurants a block away to enjoy breakfast - one of which was the notable Eggspectation.

Upon arrival at the rooms, we were greeted with numerous complimentary amenities (as a Loews Platinum member), however we were very surprised at the layout; the connecting room did not connect to the suite living room, but rather to the other side of the master bedroom, so people in the 2 bedded room would have to go through the master bedroom to get to the suite living room or kitchen! I went down to the reception desk and explained why this would not work with unrelated teens in our party, and he was very understanding and explained that the connecting room on the other side of the suite had only a King bed, however without batting an eye, he explained that he could resolve the situation by adding an additional connecting room at no extra charge, so we ended up with a 2000 sq ft three bedroom suite at no additional cost.

Particularly noteworthy - fabulous concierge service - helpful, accomodating and friendly - really making our stay so nice. There was a lovely fireplace with seating area in the main lobby (hot chocolate and marshmellows served each day!) and a very clean and well equipped fitness centre on the top floor. There was also free computer access (two computers) in a small area on the main floor which we were able to access easily. If there is one downside to this hotel, it is that there is no restaurant on site. We were told many different 'versions' as to 'why' this is the case: \"the previous restaurant did not renew its lease\" \"the restaurant is being renovated\" \"the hotel is taking it over in April\" (also told November) - whatever the reason, the hotel has converted the bar area to a small breakfast site. We had breakfast there the first morning and while the food was excellent, the table tops were no bigger than a large tapas plate and we almost spilled our coffee over everything - very 'wonky' and uncomfortable. There is room service but very very expensive as is the mini bar in the room. Despite this shortcoming, we would still rate this hotel five stars. There are many excellent restaurants within a two minute walk and the hotel itself is very very clean, spacious and welcoming. These factors were more important to us than the lack of a restaurant. We would definitely stay at the Loews again and I'd highly recommend it.", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLovely boutique hotel in centre of downtown Montreal\u201d", "Author": "monie14", "ReviewID": "UR96811734", "Content": "I took my daughter to visit Mcgill University and spent two nights at Hotel Vogue.

I certainly wouldn't hope it's the best Montreal has to offer. We stayed at the Loews for one night, originally it was to be for 2 nights but before we departed on our trip we had to cut one night off of Montreal, and I'm actually glad we didn't stay two nights here. First, a disclaimer- I'm a total hotel snob, I prefer the Four Seasons and Ritz properties, and am also a bit OCD about cleanliness, so I have pretty high standards. Don't get me wrong, our room was very clean (which says a lot coming from me) and comfortable, the front staff was cheerful, and the bathroom was actually the best part. All marble, with a wonderfully big tub. If I were in town on business, or even for a girls' trip, I would stay here again. However, I was traveling for a long-overdue vacation and time spent with my husband, and for that, this property is just adequate. It's not luxurious or romantic. This is a big, busy, bustling hotel right downtown. I prefer the elegance and calmness of a Four Seasons property (which doesn't exist in Montreal), or a small, boutique-type hotel, so this just wasn't a good fit for our purposes. The other thing is that this property is looking slightly worn. The red carpet in the halls is dated and tired-looking. Our bathroom wall had peeling paint. We had one of the executive suites, and at that price, there's just no excuse for any paint to be chipped off and peeling. I will say the hotel was very quiet though, which is a huge plus. I was rather nervous after reading some of the reviews complaining about noise. Our room was one of the back-street facing rooms, so we had no street noise and never heard our neighbors, so no thin walls here (compared to many hotels today), which was very nice and I got a good night's sleep. So while our room was clean, quiet, and comfortable, I just wanted to let people know that's it not luxurious or romantic if you're looking for that on vacation.

The free internet in the lobby was a great feature when researching sights and menus. The room was more than comfortable Ipod dock and Keurig machine included! We had an extremely spacious king, non-smoking overlooking the street. The street for the most part was very quiet and only on the first night did we hear loud voices passing by. The bed was amazingly comfortable - the only real knock on the entire stay was the bedding. We had a non-smoking room which even had a sign in it mentioning if you do smoke you'd be fined $100. Well, the bed linens were a bit smokey. Every morning my hair smelled like smoke and if you snuggled into a pillow or linen you could smell smoke. I thought maybe I'd picked it up out and about in the city, but after three nights I'm quite sure it was the bed. Only complaint and I would have mentioned it to the front desk had we a longer stay and I figured it out sooner. Onto the bathroom. The most thoughtful hotel bath I've seen. It was huge, complete with tv, phone, makeup mirror and good hairdryer. It was very spacious with a large tub and seperate shower. The best part was outside of the bath was a large vanity and stool complete with a second hairdryer and hollywood lighting. I was in heaven. We did not dine on site but had drinks in the lobby bar one night. It was OK. Drinks were nothing too exciting but the barman seemed more intrigued to talk to the other women at the bar because he never even asked my husband what he wanted to drink! Just assumed he wanted what I did. Well, the next two nights we had cocktails at the restaurant bar. Much better! The first night we were there late 12PM to 1:30 AM. After the last patrons left for dinner, they turned up some fun music and the gorgeous bartender generously kept the wine flowing - which was a feat in a city that seems to have some strict liquor laws. It was a very fun atmosphere. The second night we were there for a pre-dinner drink and were treated to some amuse bouche to nibble on. Go to this bar! Also, the conceirge was awesome. We worked with an extremely well-groomed young man who gave us two great recommendations. When I gave him some feedback he seemed very appreciative. (Vargus and Europea, if you're wondering). Two thumbs up for him! (Wish I knew his name, but my husband worked with him). We considered a few other properties for our romantic weekend - Le Crystal, W, and Hotel Nelligan. We are big into checking out other properties so we had drinks at Le Crystal and Nelligan to compare. (We couldn't find the W)! Le Crystal staff seemed a bit snobby but had a small chic bar, with inconsistant service and drink quality (we stayed for two.) The Nelligan seemed alright if you needed to be in the Old Port area but the lobby and bar/restaurant were very sterile and seemed like they could be in any Hilton type of place.

The first night got there, the bellman was talking with his friends beside the hotel and decided that it wasn't until we started unloading our luggage that he would come and help. That's okay though because our room was amazing, except the view. We actually had to change our rooms because we were essentially looking at a wall. The next morning, we wanted to switch our room, and the front desk offered us one room in the front and one room in the back on a higher floor. However, when we chose the front thinking that the view would be better, the bellman told us people were actually checking out of the hotel because it was so noisy in the front. So we asked if we could move to the back on the higher floor, which is when the front desk got annoyed with us and started getting upset and speaking in french, little did she know that I understood what she was saying, and it wasn't the nicest of all things. Once we changed rooms, and after an hour and half of waiting for the room change, we personally felt the room was perfect. So word of advice, choose the back of the hotel and a high floor for the optimal experience. The only problem with our room, which was a premium queen bedroom, was that there was hair in our bathtub, the floor was kind of sticky, and the bed was kind of hard. Weird enough to say, regardless of the staff, I would definitely stay there again, and I would highly recommend this hotel for its location and romantic appeal.

After having stayed at the Hotel Vogue in Montreal, and at the Loews in Miami Beach, I can safely say that Loews is now one of my favourite hotel brands - the level of service and accommodation is top-notch! We found an amazing deal on the hotel website -- $229 for a King room including continental room service breakfast for two and valet parking (I did the math, and valet & breakfast on their own would have been over $70). My boyfriend decided not to have the continental breakfast, and simply paid the difference between it and another breakfast option. Pro's: -While quite small, there is a clean and comfortable lobby with a fireplace sitting area and two free internet stations near the concierge desk - Friendly staff throughout the hotel, from guest services, to room service, to the valet attendants - Huge room! Loads of space for storage, tons of room for walking, there was even a separate makeup area with a mirrored counter and stool outside the bathroom - Huge bathroom! Included a separate shower and a jacuzzi tub with a small flat screen TV; overall quite nicely appointed (lots of marble) though it felt a bit 'early 90s' - Great location: Right next to St Catherine, across the street from Ogilvy and down the block from Holt Renfrew Con's: - The only minor complaint is that they forgot turndown service even though it was requested at check-in; we mentioned the error when checking out and they were very apologetic; I also mentioned this in the online customer satisfaction survey that was emailed to me after our stay, and I got a personal email of apology from the hotel (nice touch!)

The hotel , like others, is a very short walk to the major tourist hotspots and a brief walk away from the tourist information center so that was helpful. The tour operators also do pickups from the hotel, unless there is an event or a festival and the roads are blocked. The hotel is only a block or two away from Crescent street where quite a few of the bars/restaurants are located. The price of the rooms is reasonable, for a 5 star hotel as i think there are other hotels who charge much more for mediocre service.

I have been to Montreal quite a bit... started at the Queen Elizabeth and kind of bounced around since then to find the perfect hotel (LOCATION,service, etc)... I dont believe there is any other hotel (except for maybe the one accross the street!) that can beat the location of L'hotel Vogue!! There certainly isn't one that can beat the quality (in my opinion). Myself and 3 of my family members were in Montreal for a concert last May (Kanye West) and I had heard good things about the Vogue, so we decided to give it a try. We booked out one of the suites - I believe it was the \"executive suite\" - as there were 4 of us (2 in king bed, 2 on king pull-out) and we were very pleased. The layout included a spacious bedroom with a huge beautiful bathroom that had a jacuzi soaker tub and tons of counter space... a powder room-area which connected the bedroom to the living room and as also very very spacious and included a dining area (table for 6+) and a kitchenette/bar area with nice countertops, fridge etc... It was LOVELY..there was also a half bath off the living area with a shower!! The staff greeted us by NAME and were so friendly, even gave us a complimentary movie rental just to show their appreciation... I absolutely loved this place.. I remember that there was internet but I cannot recall whether it was wireless or not...either way , no complaint in that department... ..at one point we had a problem with the alarm clock (my dad is technologically challenged) and they sent someone up within 2 minutes to fix it!... very prompt service! rooms were clean. I don't believe there was much of a view but on my top 10 list of things I require my hotel have..the view is on the bottom. When you step outside the doors of the Vogue hotel you are LITERALLY about 10 steps from Ste.Catherine street!! Which is amazing... only about a block from the great restaurant \"eggspectation\"....speaking of walking out the doors... the doormen were VERY polite, and friendly and always remembered you. I CANNOT WAIT to stay at the Vogue again! If I had to say anything else it would be more of a warning than a complaint - we found that for 4 ppl, although the room had more than enough space, it was a little tight getting everyone showered in the morning (especially with 2 girls aged 18 and 20)...It wasn't a big deal, but as a picky hotel-goer..you might keep this in mind!!

Catherine. The lobby looks beautiful but is quite small. Everytime you enter and leave the hotel a nice door man opens the door for you. That does give a bit of a 5-star feeling which this hotel is supposed to be. The room itself wasn't anything special. Decor from the late 80's with a matching TV (volume went up and down for no reason), a view of the hotel right across the street, no seating area with a table, besides the working desk which isn't quite suitable for having dinner in your room. The bathroom was quite big, modern and very clean though. The beds were quite good! Matresses not too firm or too soft. The minibar hasn't been restocked once during our entire stay, not even after we've left the minibar key in the room. The coffee cups though were replenished after we did that, so perhaps that's a tip for future visitors. :-) The hotel bar is incredibly small and not much fun. The restaurant is very expensive so we didn't eat there. Room service is nothing special; the usual stuff you'd expect staying at a hotel of this caliber, with prices to match. Staff is extremely friendly, sometimes a bit too much if you ask me. It felt somewhat phoney a couple of times. If you're a member of their Loews First Program and you've selected the $10 minibar credit as the gift, check your bill! The ''gift'' wasn't deducted from our bill but we didn't see that until we were well on our way to the airport. All in all not bad at all, but not really 5 stars either. The good deal on the room rate made up for all of the \u00c2\u00b4flaws\u00c2\u00b4, but that\u00c2\u00b4s it basically.", "Date": "May 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service, Fantastic Location, Needs a Few Updates...\u201d", "Author": "lagunadallas", "ReviewID": "UR16440073", "Content": "I just returned from the Loews Hotel Vogue in Montreal. It was my first trip to this fantastic city, and the Vogue is in a very good location for easy access to many of the best restaurants, shops, and Mont Royal. Old Montreal and other areas are just a quick cab ride away. I have to give the Vogue a 5-star rating regarding service...friendly, helpful, and a great welcome to the city. Other than the location, other positives were the very attentive bell staff and doormen, a top-notch bartender in the lounge, and one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever experienced! What keeps me from giving it an overall 5-star rating is that the decor was a bit dated (bathroom in particular, though the size was excellent) and the hotel does not have wireless internet (in 2008!). Apparently they're working on it, but the wireless signal I was picking up in the lobby was from the hotel across the street. I could've given them a little slack on that, but not when I found out that the plug-in internet access at the desk in my room was $15/day. I really enjoyed the Vogue and felt the $250/night was pretty reasonable on a busy and gorgeous weekend, though after walking around the city and seeing some of the other choices, I'd likely give the Sofitel or W (or one of a few other highly-rated hotels I've seen here on TripAdvisor) a try the next time around.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Hotel\u201d", "Author": "3LittleFonzys", "ReviewID": "UR16328888", "Content": "Had a fantastic time at this hotel - staff were great and could not do enough for me and my girlfriend - who had only just broken her leg at Mont Tremblant and had spent the last 3-4 days in Montreal General Hospital.

I had a corner room with an adjoining living space. My mom and I stayed in the bedroom and my brother slept on the pull-out sofa on the living room side.

I'm a person who makes hotel decisions based on the look of the bathroom and I definitely made the right decision. The bathrooms are fantastic! It was almost as large as the bedroom with a vanity area and separate shower stall, but the best part is the tub. I travel quite frequently for work, and I can honestly say that it was the largest jacuzzi tub I've ever seen in a hotel. Though I never used it, my mom and brother raved about it. They'd never been to Montreal before, but felt that the jacuzzi tub made it all worthwhile! I can't say enough about the place. The prices were reasonable and the rooms were great, plus the hotel is centrally located less than a block away from St. Catherine - one of the major shopping destinations in the city.

We booked this hotel after reading the reviews and couldn't have been happier. My husband, I and our three pre-teen to teenaged kids loved our weekend stay in Montreal at Loew's. This is a beautiful, centrally located hotel with fabulous service; the combination of posh decor and top-notch staff can't be beat. The car valets, doormen and front desk staff were all very friendly; the kids loved the huge jars of M & M's with scoops at the front desk; they were each also presented with a personalized note and a voucher for a free in-room movie during our stay - they truly felt welcomed here. Our quiet, clean connecting rooms featured two doubles connecting to a queen bed with a canopy which worked perfectly for us. Though a bit on the small side as has been mentioned, these are gorgeous rooms with high ceilings and well-thought-out amenities - flat screen TV, comfortable bed with a crisp white duvet, minibar, coffee maker with take-out cups and lids, desk, closet with safe, etc. - so the size was certainly not a problem. The only negative was our view of the roof of the next building. If I get the chance to visit again, I would request a street view. The bathrooms are fantastic -- large, marble everywhere, jacuzzi tub, separate shower, plenty of counter space, two hair dryers (one in the bathroom, one outside it at the small vanity area), nice toiletries and another flat-screen TV viewable from the tub. We enjoyed a drink at the lobby bar in the evenings while the kids watched their free movies - again impeccable service. Loew's is in the midst of downtown dining and shopping including the large underground, out-of-the-weather shopping areas (entrance 3 blocks away). The concierge recommended two good restaurants also within walking distance: Le Taj for Indian food (small portions but very tasty - great naan) and Le Pois Penche for upscale French bistro fare (great service and ambience) and both welcomed the kids. Egg Spectations for brunch which is just a block or so away is not to be missed. (The Italian restaurant on the premises looked good but we did not eat there.) We also were a quick walk away from the Musee des Beaux-Arts and took in the fine Cuban Art expedition.

The whirlpool with the flat screen tv is also great for relaxing after a day of shopping and walking around. Valet parking is $30 which is on the higher end for Montreal - hotels seem to range from $20-30 but I know my car is safe in a private underground parkade. The restaurant isn't very good and I don't recommend eating there. We didn't eat there this last visit but I ate there in August when I was traveling with my husband and my infant daughter because it was pouring and we didn't want to leave the hotel. Our dinner was $150 and we only had one drink each. My husband had a steak and there were so many cuts in it, (to check if it was cooked) it looked like something that came off of dad's bbq, not something you'd expect in a restaurant. I have to give credit to the service though and the waiter brought plain pasta for my daughter at no charge. The hotel staff also provided exceptional service. Their slogan 'Loews loves kids' holds true as they have a contract with Fisher Price so you can borrow toys during your stay. I requested a couple of toys when we arrived and when we returned to our room there was a potty. I have a one year old and I did not want her playing with a potty!

Rooms are large, comfortable, and very attractive. Bathroom was huge and very nicely appointed. Staff were friendly, helpful, and professional, a very nice mix. I particularly commend the doormen. I paid $242/night (+ $40 in taxes), which is the AAA rate. When the US dollar is strong this hotel is a bargain, at parity we are approaching NYC rates. My quibbles are that at this rate I would expect internet access in rooms to be free (not $15 to use a wire; wireless in the lobby is through a vendor that seems to want you to buy minutes--I relied on my Blackberry, instead, and the free computers in the lobby). Those loby computers, complete with free printing, are a nice touch. There is a breakfast buffet laid out in the restaurant--$16 or so for fruit, cereal, juice, coffee, coldcuts, cheese, and yogurt. Not bad, not generous. OK, here's a pet peeve others may not share: I strongly resent the bottle of water in the room that costs $6.50. Yes, I know, by know most experienced travelers have seen this trap. But it seems wrong for hotels to lay traps for \"guest\"--$6.50 for the bottle, and the have the snotty temerity to add \"Enjoy!\" to the label. More fundamentally, these days we are all subject to incredible demands on our attention--airports, airplance, hotel rooms all full of ads and commercials. In the room we really deserve a little TLC, which would in this instance translate into not having to read every label to know what peril lies within. As for the minibar, which I think had some device that would indicate if it had been opened, let alone accessed...you would not find my fingerprints on that one. Here's a tip: If you head down Ste Catherine and turn left on St. Denis--about a mile walk or a couple of metro stops--a few doors up the street and on your right you will encounter Juliette au Chocolat, a shop that serves truly extraordinary chocolat in almost every imaginable form. I am not given to hyperbole, I think:: your cup of hot chocolate may be white, milk, semi-sweet or several grades of dark (with cocoa %s given), served in the classic or \"ancienne\" (Grandma's) style--with a few fair trade options to salve the conscience.. There are also chocolates to take home, chocolate brownies, fondue, crepes, etc. So, enjoy Loew's, and consider a stop at Juliette's if you enjoy fine chocolate on a cool day.

Rooms. The rooms are always nice, but on this last visit I had a room that somehow seemed bigger and recently renovated. It was beautiful and comfortable with a gorgeous bathroom. The bed is extremely comfortable and the linens are top-notch. Value: The overall experience is 5 star without question at 4 star prices. That does not happen too often in today's world. Service. The highest standard I have ever seen. Everyone addresses you by name. They can't do enough for you. The room service is the fastest I have ever had, and very good. The small bar is really warm and friendly and always busy at cocktail hour, humming with nicely dressed people.

I'm also a Priceline regular but this time, I wanted to indulge and it was also the Nascar AND Pride week-end in Montreal which meant few hotels had availabilty. Found a good rate at the Loews and jumped on it and boy, was I ever glad I did! What makes this hotel so special certainly is it's high level of personalized yet, not overpretentious service. Of course, you have it's great rooms too! From the moment we walked in the door to our departure, we had everything we could have wanted. Bellman always there to greet you, nice fresh cut flowers in the relatively small, but elegant lobby. Check-in and concierge staff were gracious and made us feel at home. They were professional, yet not cold and too distant like the often case of large chain hotels. Such a constrast with the Sheraton I stayed at a few weeks before a few blocks from there. Cannot say enough good things about the staff. I called them back to book again for late August and the lady at the reservation office was equally helpful and you can just tell they like what they do. The hotel might not have a pool or many services, but it's rooms are heavenly. Certainly not dated but rather decorated in a more classice way. Our furniture was in a good repair. The housekeeping and cleanliness top notch. They vacuum around the edges. The bed was the best I slept in so far this year, liked it better than Westin's heavenly bed. The pillows were equally amazing, I would have all brought them back home but then housekeeping would have noticed... Kidding aside, bathroom equally great, despite the shower being more ordinary than is some other prestigious hotels but still fine in my book. I'm a Loews First member and all my preference were accomodated and the wine and nuts promptly sent up to the room. We had a queen room with a four-poster bed overlooking De la Montage which others found noisy but I did not. Drapes keep the room pitch dark, it's quite amazing. There is an iHome iPod compatible radio in the room If you have one. The location is great, we were in town for Divers-Cit\u00c3\u00a9 and even if this hotel is relatively far from the Gay village, it's an easy subway or cab ride away (M\u00c3\u00a9tro is two blocks away, Peel). In fact, it's proximity to Ste-Catherine and Crescent is a big plus for some. We had a good time on top of L'hotel de la Montagne patio's on the rooftop across the street.

Neither of us had very much experience with Montreal hotels, so after internet searches we decided to stay at the Vogue. We were totally unprepared for the Vogue experience. We flew into Montreal and arriving early at the hotel we were concerned that we would have to wait hours to get into our room. While checking in, a hotel guest who was sitting in the lobby asked us if it was our first time here? When we answered 'yes' he said \"well, it won't be your last, you will never stay anywhere else in Montreal\". My friend and I just smiled and looked at each other rather skeptically as we were not particularly impressed with the lobby. It was clean but small and unassuming. Anyway, our room was available and we drilled the fellow who brought out bags to our room. He was soooo knowledgeable about the city and spent at least twenty minutes with us, providing shopping and restaurant tips. I could go on and on but the long and short of it - the doorman and all of the bellmen knew we were there to shop and became quite excited when we came back with bags and equally disappointed when we returned empty handed. We dined one night at the hotel restaurant. The service was impeccable and food superb. The amuse bouche was wonderful. The hotel bar!!The hotel bar!!! After the third night of going there for a nightcap we became 'regulars' as were 90% of the people there. Everyone knew each other as they all had been coming to the hotel for years and the bartender knew them on a first name basis. I happened to mention to someone that my husband was a scuba diver - the next thing I knew, everyone in the bar was involved in a discussion about scuba diving and providing me tips of the best diving sites in the world to pass onto my husband. Honestly, it is like a small friendly community. As far as our room. It was large and clean. Two very comfortable queen sized beds with lots of room for our luggage and to sit and relax. The bathroom was fabulous. It was enormous with a large jacuzzi tube, separate shower and marble vanity. The room also had a lit vanity mirror and second hairblower in the hallway. This was a bonus for two females! The location is great for shopping - right across the street from Ogilvie's, Holt Renfrew is a short walk with lots of boutiques along the way and St. Catherines Street is very close. Also,the location is a short cab ride to Old Montreal for shopping or dining. One tip - on arriving at the Montreal airport we decided to pay a bit more than the flat fee taxi fare (I can't remember how much) and take a limousine to the hotel. We had decided to take a limo back to the airport but found out that there is a huge increase in limo fares from Montreal back to the airport.

There's a cozy and stylish little bar area where you can have a drink, and another area with comfy chairs, a sofa, and a fireplace where you can read the newspaper etc. The only thing to avoid is the hotel's restaurant. The food was very mediocre and disappointing, in contrast to so many other places in Montreal. Service was only fair, even when the restuarant was practically empty. Don't waste your money!

The Loews met our expectations. Location We found the hotel was difficult to find because of all the one way streets around the hotel. We missed the turn as the hotel is not located on a main street. So make sure you ask for good directions when leaving the airport. Service We took the red eye flight, at the time it seemed like a good idea at the time. However, we forgot that check in was at 4 pm. So we were forced to tour Old Montreal early. Our room was not ready but the front desk said they would call us once it was. We were able to get our room around 3 pm.. so we were very tired. The hotel lobby is small and your room key is required to access the elevator. The doorman was very helpful with directions and greeted us each time we came and left the hotel. When it rained, the doorman provided us with an umbrella for our shopping trips. There were fruits in the lobby for guests, hidden the corner. Parking Valet parking is the only choice. we found they we had to wait often despite calling ahead of time. I think they were short staffed and the hotel does not have a private drive for the valet cars so you see the staff moving cars alot along the busy Montreal street the hotel is located. If you are thinking about self parking, there is none that is within walking distance. One thing about Montreal, some of the older areas, you will notice very narrow streets. Room When we finally did settle into our room, the room was a nice size. Bathroom was nice, jacuzzi tub with T V, separate walk in shower, separate vanity/make up mirror outside of bathroom. Bed was comfortable, clean room. no dust. window coverings provide a dark room if you are looking to catch some sleep. Nightly turn down included. Location/Attractions Nearby The hotel is located directly across from a gentleman's club and the shopping district on St. Catherines Street./underground shopping. also has several gentleman's entertainment and shopping, an odd mix but you see the bouncer standing outside of these locations. You can't miss the neon signs. But, dont' worry it is child friendly and we found the crowd was not as loud as downtown Toronto night life. Loved the location it was very close to the underground shopping centre that Montreal is so popular. Shopping was great because we found lots of deals ( end of summer sales).. We found alot of restaurants within walking distance. However, to tour Montreal I would recommend renting a car to see Old Montreal or Latin town.

Our package gave us a daily continental breakfast, served as room service. Fresh croissants, danishes, and muffins were served with excellent jams and marmalade, as well as tea, coffee, and juice, complimented with a vase of fresh flowers. Service by all staff at the hotel was wonderful -- from reception to the concierge, the bellmen to the parking attendants ,we were met with smiling faces all eager to help. The concierges were especially helpful, suggesting restaurants and jazz clubs that turned out to be top notch. Check in and check out were quick and easy, and upon our departure we were handed a little bag for the road containing fresh fruit and bottled waters. A nice touch for a long drive home! My husband and I have stayed at many hotels and resorts in various places around the world that have all been highly rated, but this one may just be our new favorite! Oh, and for dog lovers like us, this is a dog friendly hotel and has room service for dogs consisting of specially prepared balanced meals and bottled water. For those with children (or babies, like us), they offer different programs to make your stay more enjoyable, as well as cribs for the little ones. We can't say enough -- the Loews exceeded all of our expectations!

However, my stay at this hotel made a 5 day conference trip really wonderful. My room was as elegant as a five star hotel in Manhattan. The bathroom had beautiful granite, and in a lovely way, not in the cheesy way you see in many hotels. It had a deep tub as well as a separate glassed-in shower. I never use tubs in hotels, but this was more like a spa, so I used it twice (fun to watch Star Wars with French dubbing at 1am). Even the artwork on the walls was lovely. The room was so quiet and the curtains so thick that I was able to sleep late every day (stayed on west coast time successfully). The two elevators were very fast and I never waited more than a few seconds. Even the gym was decent enough to get me in there working out (and open 24 hours). My only complaint is they charged $15/day for the internet connection (which was very fast). Trying to freeload off the local wireless didn't work. Also, all extra amenities and food are very expensive, so I recommend eating out. I used the metro extensively. It's 2 short blocks from the hotel. The street one walks on, St. Catherine-something, is quite lively with shops, but there are also some (relatively tame-looking) strip joints along that walk and late at night there are transients out and about. The metro stop itself at this particular location (Peel) is a bit gritty; the others I went to were much nicer. So that might be a turn off for some people. I recommend buying a week long pass for $19 if you'll be using it extensively. I would definitely stay here again if I visit Montreal again. This was a magical hotel for me. I was so relaxed there and slept so well (and should add now that the bed linens were wonderful, as was the turndown service which left classical music playing and truly terrific chocolate).

However, the noisy, busy exterior is soon left behind the minute you are welcomed by the accomadating doorman, and step into the small, warm and cozy lobby interior. To the left upon entry was a cozy, bookshelved fireplace and waiting area, furnished with oversized chairs, sofas, and coffee tables displayed with impressive looking hardcover books on art, natural history, architecture, and the like. There is a small, sunken cocktail bar to the right upon entering the lobby, and just beyond that is the hotel restaurant. My husband and I have stayed here twice - once in early fall(October 2005) and again recently in winter (March 4-6, 2006). Both times we were thoroughly satisfied and enjoyed what the hotel had to offer in the way of service, comfort and anemities. A word of caution to summertime and fall guests: because this is a downtown hotel and located right in the heart of the bar-hopping and nightclub scene, ask for a room at the back of the hotel, as the front facing rooms pick up a lot of street noise from below. This is not so much a problem during the winter, when downtown revellers generally stay indoors, and tend to leave their cars at home, but in the summer the noise level picks up quite a bit, and can interfere with a good night's sleep. This was our only complaint (and a minor one, as the room was perfect and met all my expectations), which the hotel front desk staff duly noted. I was pleasantly surprised upon our second stay that the hotel remembered our comments, and not only welcomed us back as guests and greeted us by name upon check-in, but remembered to give us a quieter room towards the back of the hotel. It is the small details such as this which give the hotel extra points for service, as far as we are concerned. Two thumbs up for remembering their homework here! Both times we booked through the hotel's web site, for a premium/deluxe room. Check-in was courteous, prompt and friendly and secure. You are given a credit-card type room key with which you must use on the elevator to access your floor and then your room. Now we come to the best part - the rooms. The rooms are absolutely *WONDERFUL.* Spacious, cozy, warm, and tastefully furnished. Generous closet space (with complimentary umbrella even!), bathrobe, in-room safe, and extra blanket and pillow if needed. The mini-bar (which we did not use) was filled with champagne, wine, imported beer, snacks, etc., with wine glasses, ice bucket and corkscrew nearby (unfortunately, there are no ice machines available on any of the floors - you have to call room service to get ice, or go downstairs to the hotel lobby cocktail bar). The bed was absolutely LUXURIOUS with comfortable (not too hard, or overly soft) king size mattress and bedding which included generous, comfy pillows and an opulent, luxurious, down-filled duvet that you could just sink into and lose yourself. But wait, it gets better... The bathrooms are this hotel's BEST feature and well worth taking advantage of. The huge, marbleized bathroom features a separate enclosed shower area, with the toilet area discretely tucked away from the GENEROUS oversized jacuzzi tub, which can comfortably accomadate two people. There's nothing I love better at a 5-star hotel than to immerse oneself in a luxurious, oversized jacuzzi tub filled to the brim with one's favorite bath essence or oils, and reLAAAX... and this hotel fits the bill perfectly. Towels are luxuriant 100% cotton, and plentiful. Included anemities are tastefully arranged bathroom sundries such as skin lotions, scented soaps, shampoos and cloths. Nightly turndown service was included in the price which included chocolates on the pillow, and the room being misted after pillows have been fluffed up, and sheets turned down. This is a wonderful hotel: tasteful, clean, luxurious, friendly and accomadating. I would not hesitate to stay here a third time! My only reluctance from giving this hotel an excellent rating is the lack of individual room temperature controls. I found the room overly warm and the air very dry. Since I always like to turn down the temperature at night before going to sleep, the lack of this feature made it a little uncomfortable. Other than that, it was a near perfect stay. For those who like to bar-hop, there are a plethora of nightclubs, bars and cafes to choose from. Shop-a-holics will enjoy the many boutiques (and Ogilivy's department store across the street)nearby, and for art lovers, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts is just up the street. Montreal is also known for it's exceptional cuisine in all of North America, and you will have no problem finding many excellent restaurants nearby - all within comfortable walking distance of the hotel's front doors! As a final note, I would avoid eating in the hotel dining room (or even ordering room service), as it tends to be overly pricey. Instead, I highly recommend taking a stroll over to Crescent street and thereabouts to enjoy the many diverse choices of restaurant cuisine offered. ~appaloosa 12/03/2006", "Date": "March 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto ON", "Title": "\u201cTop notch\u201d", "Author": "Riknpat", "ReviewID": "UR4602129", "Content": "We spent a weekend at the Vogue in mid January.

I mentioned it to the front desk during check out and they said that they are planning to install new windows in the hotel to block out the noise. The only other issue was the time we returned to our room to discover that housekeeping neglected to shut the door (luckily, nothing was missing). Aside from the above, the Hotel Vogue was very nice. Our premium room was spacious, the bathroom was huge and very clean. We loved the jacuzzi tub and the TV in the bathroom. The rooms could have been a little sunnier but I guess you can't expect that from a city hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our flight was cancelled from NY the night before due to weather and management did not charge us for the late cancellation. We were celebrating a special occasion and they sent us a surprise cake.

Staff very polished and professional, but also warm and friendly. The Vogue manages to pull off that difficult combination of sophistication and warmth, so a guest can enjoy elegant surroundings without being subjected to stuffy attitudes. I actually stayed in two different rooms because there was a problem with the shower in the first room I occupied. On discovering the problem, I was quickly and cheerfully moved to another room that was equally nice and in fact a bit larger. As urban hotels go, the Vogue is pretty quiet. However, if you are a light sleeper, ask for a room in the back of the hotel. My first room was in the back, and I never spent a more quiet evening in a city hotel. When I moved, it was to a room in the front and I did notice some increase in street noise, especially on Friday night when late-night revelers were disbursing from the clubs on nearby Crescent Street. The location of the hotel is perfect. Close to great shopping, several museums, many excellent restaurants and a metro stop nearby. The three-day combo pass for museums/metro is a great value at $39 CA and you can purchase it at many locations. Two wonderful restaurants within a short walk of the Vogue are Europea and L' Autre Season. I had memorable meals at both places.

Now there are a bunch of boutique-style hotels that opened in Old Montreal as well as on the Eastern border of central downtown (e.g., Hotel Godin, Hotel Gault, W Hotel, St. James, Hotel St. Paul). The problem for me with those hotels is their location. Although they are located in nice areas of Montreal, they are not centrally located to the central area of downtown where most of the shopping is. On the other hand, nothing beats Old Montreal in the summer. Words of warning: Ritz Carlton has beautiful public spaces, but rooms are not up to Ritz standards. The Omni used to be a Four Seasons and the rooms still have the same scratched and tattered furnishings form when Four Seasons gave it up back in the 80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.
