This part of Mongkok is bustling and full of neon and busy all night, which I like.The hotel itself is an uninspiring, personality-less, generic 3-star property where the staff are superficially friendly but nobody speaks good English or seems to know quite how to do anything like, say, run a hotel. The room was clean and adequate. If I'd been staying more than one night or if I'd paid a penny more than $US125, I would've been disappointed. But on a tight budget, the Stanford is a good option in its class -- it's well-located, much nicer than a youth hostel and cheaper than almost any other hotel in HK. (Personally?

I paid $62 (+13% tax) for a single through a special offer on Expedia, and this was a fantastic bargain.The hotel is located right next to the wonderful Ladies Market, just a few blocks off of Nathan Rd (the main street of Kowloon). This puts you close to all of the great public transportation. Note that Soy St where it meets Nathan is a pedestrian street - this was confusing for me when I got off of the Airport bus on Nathan Rd., but it's practically right at the stop (look for the Bank of China). A quick couple of short blocks down and you're right at the hotel (easily walkable w luggage if you didn't bring too much).The lobby is small and the rooms are too, but everything is fairly modern and very clean. The beds had beautiful white duvets and nice firm mattresses. My second room (changed rooms first night because of on odd paint smell) on the 19th floor had a large wall-mounted flat-screen tv. All rooms come with a mini-fridge (stocked) and complimentary tea maker and fixings.A couple of things to be aware of - the restaurant is pretty bad (bland and overpriced), but with lots of restaurant options in the area you shouldn't need to eat there. There's another restaurant (not owned by the hotel) in the basement, but I didn't try it. The room has no real place to store or put clothes away, just a tiny closet that will fit a 22 carryon laying down. There are a couple of small drawers in the desk and nightstand, but don't count on a having real dresser. Lastly, bring your own hair conditioner or plan to buy some at the local drugstore - the shower and sink have a wall-mounted dispenser containing all-in-one hand soap/shampoo.The concierge was rarely at his desk, but I did arrange a tour through him the last day and he was very helpful.
