This was my first time here but my 10th ish time in Bali. The place was perfect for us. We rented one unit and our friends rented the upstairs unit. In the evenings we would congregate on the balcony for drink and look out over the small gorge to the rice fields beyond. The breakfasts in the morning were great (again on the balcony or in a small seating area near the pool) and consited of fresh fruit, omelletes, jaffles, coffee, or balinese porrige.Going into town is very easy - a short stroll through the village (much nicer than Ubud proper, through (or around) Monkey Forest and there you are in the thick of it. 10mins. Sometimes we would use the free shuttle that the hotel prvided if we were going out to dinner.Although we travelled with small kids I think it would also be a perfect place for couples since all the accomodation is situated in seperate houses (see photos and google earth). Finally the staff were fantastic, naturally warm as most Balinese are. The place is beautiful, the staff are great and it has soul which some of the other - beautifully and slickly crafted - resorts lack.", "Date": "Dec 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR332435678", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "sunshiny_8"}, {"Content": "What a find!!

Once again we had a wonderful time at Alam Group (this time we stayed at Alam Jiwa) in Ubud.Alam Jiwa was little bit cozy than Alam Shanti which we stayed last year. However the service and the staff are pretty same and we had a wonderful time.Only thing I would like to say was...we booked mountain bike tour through the reception. We had a problem when it comes for payment. We wanted to pay by credit card and tour company and reception didn't inform us that we could not pay by credit card. ( which was almost 1 million Rp) At the end we found out we could pay by credit card through tour company but because the tour company didn't want to pay 3 % sur charge to credit card company, they refused to accept credit card. Of course when we asked Alam Jiwa to put on our hotel bill they informed us about 3%,,,Anyway Sometimes Balinies does not communicate us for good heart. I know it was not Alam Jiwa's fault but at least we wanted to know before we went to tour, about payment from tour company or Alam Jiwa.Other than that. the room was great (our room Caswary did not have stand shower just shawer at bath tub) but enough space, and afternoon tea and coffee with Cafe Wayan cake was great.", "Date": "Jan 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR714665586", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "makichan"}, {"Content": "Alam Jiwa: a great place to be       Upstairs bedroom in Cendrawasih suite", "Date": "Nov 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR689032517", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "atrejseeratleve"}, {"Content": "The best boutique hotel in the world We have lived in Singapore for 7 years and have been going to Bali for r+r about twice a year.

Hope this might help someone else looking for the same type of experience.I knew Alam Jiwa was outside of Ubud, but was under the impression it was just a 10 minute walk away. It was more like a 15 minute walk either through or around the Monkey Forest (loved it!) to the start of Ubud's main shopping/dining area. Then, another 20-30 minutes walk to the center of Ubud. I am an active person and love walking, but that was way too much to be doing every day, even for me, in heat and humidity.There is a free shuttle provided by the hotel, but this can be slightly inconvenient if, like me, you want to just go independently when and where you want.Basically, for me Alam Jiwa was a bit too isolated. The location was pretty, but not spectacular. It is in a village south of Ubud, with a few shops (for locals and tourists), a school, and football field - a moderately interesting place to walk around, but nothing like the variety of central Ubud.I had a lower-level room with air-con. The room was traditionally decorated, with a very large covered private balcony. A nice room, but not great. Room lighting at night was very, very dim - if you like to read at night, bring a flashlight!Service was very good and I especially liked having breakfast delivered to my room every morning. There's a small pool that I didn't use. Rate was $85 per night. Overall it was a charming place with helpful and pleasant staff, and certainly worth the price.

It's definitely tucked out of the way from the main roads, which lends it a very nice feeling of what it must be like to live like a local. Front staff and groundskeeping crew were very polite and friendly. Our greeter was an older gentleman with glasses who spoke so softly yet directly that it caught me off guard. Our greeter/front office manager provided us an overview of services, made us aware of the free breakfast and complimentary afternoon tea services provided by Alam Jiwa, as well as a free shuttle from Alam Jiwa into town and back. All we had to do was call the number on their business card to request driver pickup. Front staff provided luggage porters to assist us with our luggage. We stayed at the Garuda room which had large windows that provided an unobstructed view of the rice fields on the backside of the property. It was calming to see the rice field workers make their way into the fields to perform to their duties each morning. Although Alam Jiwa had a small pool, my wife and I did not take advantage of it during our stay. The pool was not as relaxing as Uma Ubud, and not as grand as the Ritz Carlton Bali. I would say that the pool was so small that it got crowded fairly quickly. First impressions were, whoa, this is one big room for the price that we paid. Much bigger room than all of our others during our honeymoon (Ritz Carlton, Uma Ubud, Bayu Cottages, Ellie's). Alam Jiwa didn't feel so much like a hotel as it did a private residence with unusually large rooms and individual patio areas. Complimentary bottled water awaited us in our rooms as did complimentary fresh fruit. Upon arrival we had a knock on our door with a gentleman providing us complimentary welcome fruit drinks. Very nice way to arrive. The large bed (King size) had a circular mosquito netting with a heavy weight at the bottom that kept insects out. The entranceway to the bathroom had the most interesting frog motif over it, while utilizing traditional Balinese double doors for privacy. The bathroom was very large complete with a drying rack for clothes and a deep tub that gave you a clear view of the rice paddies behind the building. The location of the air conditioning unit in the bedroom makes it not too effective in cooling off the bathroom. But it wasn't an issue for us given Ubud's cooler climate at the time that we visited. None of the rooms in Alam Jiwa have a telephone, or television for that matter. Don't even bother looking for a clock. Oddly enough, at every one of our hotels, NONE of them had a clock. Apparently time means very little in Bali since it's so beautiful that you naturally want to take your time. But that being said, if you were truly looking to disconnect from the wired world, this was a good place to slow time down and relax. Morning breakfast was good. Coffee and tea were good, and I would recommend sticking with the Indonesian fare for breakfast instead of the pancake option. Their pancakes aren't Western style pancakes, more like a crepe, although I liked their mueslix with yogurt and fresh fruits. Definitely recommend their fruit juice mixes. Their staff does a pretty good job on them. The one thing that I would note is that the proximity of the rice fields allows you to get closer to the wildlife. Although my wife and I had breakfast out on the patio, you had to be careful with all of the ants along the floor not to provide them a leg for them to crawl up, or to drop food that would cause them to swarm. It should be noted that we did not notice any ants in our room. Also, our first night at Alam Jiwa, we experienced first hand why the Balinese consider geckos lucky. A huge gecko popped out from behind a large Balinese painting, FLEW down the wall and snapped up a very large beetle before zipping back up the wall behind the painting in under 2 seconds. I jumped because I thought it was a very quick snake. If you absolutely can't stand seeing a little local Balinese wildlife share the room with you, Alam Jiwa may not be the best choice for you. The location of Alam Jiwa made it a fairly short 10 minute walk through the Monkey Forest of Ubud to the shops of Monkey Forest Road and JL Bisma. Alam Jiwa is about a good 30-45 minute walk to the Ubud Main Road however, and I would not recommend walking through the Monkey Forest Road at night for personal safety reasons. While we were there we were unable to contact Alam Jiwa for a ride back to the hotel because of some kind of busy tone on the telephone network. It should be noted that Bali apparently uses the same kind of telephone switching system that was used in the U.S. during the 1950s. As a result, wireless phones are significantly more reliable than landlines in the country. The ride back to the hotel from Ubud Main Road was about $3USD. On a separate note, wherever shopping/massage place we went in Ubud, everyone asked us where we were staying. When we answered Alam Jiwa, I swear we seemed to get better pricing than when we answered Uma Ubud (a pricier hotel). Something to keep in mind when bartering for some great gifts and souvenirs to take home. My wife and I asked the front staff on entertainment recommendations in Ubud. They made an outstanding recommendation to see a local traditional Legong dance. Great show, definitely a must see if it's your first exposure to traditional Balinese dance. Also requested info on great places to dine. Alam Jiwa made an outstanding and ok recommendation with the Dirty Duck and Cafe Wayan respectively. All in all, a very economical way to spend a few days in Ubud, if you can tolerate the curiosities of minor wildlife.", "Date": "Jun 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR728731729", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "maxim531"}, {"Content": "Treated like royalty, loved it!

My husband and I stayed at Alam Jiwa for 5 nights in December, and we couldn't have been more impressed. I stayed at its sister hotel, Alam Shanti, with a friend in May and absolutely loved it, so I was disappointed that AS was already booked and that I had to go with AJ instead. I still can't believe that Alam Jiwa was even nicer!We booked through their website for US$65/night and had a enormous room overlooking rice fields. The king-sized bed was very comfortable, and I felt like a princess surrounded by its mosquito netting. The bathroom was also huge and provided everything you could possibly want, including a hair dryer, which is NOT always the case in many Asian hotels. We enjoyed a delicious breakfast each morning on our lovely veranda and a relaxing swim every evening in their perfect-temperature pool. The grounds of Alam Jiwa are absolutely beautiful and provide a surprising amount of privacy.Alam Jiwa freely and happily provides whatever transportation you require in the Ubud area. I felt like we REALLY took advantage of this by frequently going into town separately, and they didn't bat an eye. We also arranged transportation to and from the airport through Alam Jiwa and a tour of the area down to Tanah Lot, and all was comparably priced, if not cheaper, than what we could get in town.The staff was incredibly helpful, always smiling and friendly.

I have also been to Bali ten times and have stayed in every type of lodging available there. The Alam Jiwa in Nyuh Kuning just outside of Ubud has raised the hospitality bar to a new level and has become the gold standard for every new resort that we will vacation at from this point on. Alam Jiwa is a small ten room hotel set within beautiful gardens with stone walls and pathways that make the place truely magical. The rooms, housed in four three story bungalows and each different from the next, look out to the rice fields with a view of Mount Agung in the distance. Our favorite, The Merpati Room on the third floor, had a large open air bathroom, a canopied king bed with plenty of room for a single cot for our daughter, and a large terrace furnished in Indonesian Antiques. For $85 a night my husband and five year old daughter and I were treated like royalty. A full breakfast of our choosing- fresh juice, coffee, fruit salad, freshly baked breads, and omelets or crepes were served every morning at either our terrace or at the little dining area overlooking the pool and gardens. Every afternoon fresh cakes and tea were served poolside or at our terrace. The owners also have a restaurant several blocks away and you can order meals to be delivered and served on your terrace at any time of day. Also included in the price of our stay was a 8am-10pm shuttle service at our disposal to take us into Ubud, pick us up from our spa appointments and deliver us to Dance performances in the evenings. This was such a great service and we used it at least twice a day. If we chose to, we could take a 20 minute walk into Ubud via the monkey forest that separates Nyuh Kuning from Ubud. The Monkey forest has thankfully prevented the commercial sprawl of Ubud from spilling into this little village and a sense of peaceful retreat prevailed at Alam Jiwa, our home away from home for three weeks in June 2004. There is nothing pretentious about this place. The staff's friendliness and warmth is heartfelt and no trouble is too much for them . We took a side trip for four days and when I asked Ayu, the assistant manager about settling our bill, she said we could take care of it when we returned. Such trust and graciousness. They really did become like family to us as we got a chance to talk with these dear people. Comang, the wonderful manager who has done a stellar job of training his crew, took Us out to dinner on our last night. Our daughter cried when we had to leave and told Comang that next time we will stay for a year. We were ready to move in.If you are the sort of traveller who needs to spend a lot of money or treat the staff like mere servants in order to feel that you are getting the 5 star treatment that you need, then stay at anyone of the foreign owned chain resorts that has sadly come to clutter the pristine Bali landscape over the past dozen years. If you would like a chance to feel that you are supporting the local economy and getting to experience authentic Balinese hospitality, book a room at the Alam Jiwa.Check out their website. It really doesn't do the place justice. The hotel was even featured in Conde Nast's Traveller Room with a View page last year.
