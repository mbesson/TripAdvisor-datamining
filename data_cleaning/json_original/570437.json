Yes, the room is small, but the bed is big and it is in Rome so we were outside most of the time. It has a stocked fridge with prices that are not too bad, I've seen MUCH worse in American hotels. We used the fridge for supplies from the market. It has a small balcony, 2X5 ft, overlooking the hotel next door but you can still go out on the belcony and get some air. The bathroom is OK. There is only a shower and it is small, 2X2 ft, but with more hot water and high pressure than anyone needs-nice. The service was great, namely Geno. We arrive at 8AM, as expected the room was not ready, and he helped us with our bags and got us a map and sent us in the right direction. He let use the hotel computer to book tickets. Always willing to help and he does speak english. The location is great. It is 1 block from the Republica Metro stop and a 1/4 mile from the Termini and of course all bus stops are on Via Nazionale. It was great for 2 people.", "Date": "July 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast", "Title": "\u201cA great hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Hapapyholiday", "ReviewID": "UR7368179", "Content": "staff are pleasent, rooms small but not tiny, would def stay again. for all the time we spent in the hotel, brekky was lovely. would def reccomend.", "Date": "April 16, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Residence Le Petit", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d570437-Reviews-Residence_Le_Petit-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$102 - $139*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Camilla 27</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00179</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "570437", "ImgURL": "http://www.venere.com/img/hotel/3/3/6/2/112633/112633.jpg"}}
