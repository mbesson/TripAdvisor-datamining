They are connected by a mutual hall way and on the Crowne Plaza side it is beautiful with a nice little bar, big screen and a coupel nice place to eat. The staff at the Crowne is amazing.,.....Understandbally my company wanted to save some $$ in this economy so they asked me to change to the Holiday Inn and if it was OK we would start putting everybody there. I was the test dummy......Man it is a different experience. For starters my sink was right next to my bed, so when you turned th water on high, it blasted all out of the sink and onto your bed. Fun sleeping in a puddle of water..... Next, no safe...I know it is a huge inventment to add safes to room...Must cost $100 a pop. WHat I pay for one night, pays for a new safe in the room. We are in MEXICO CITY for gods sake, hotels NEED a safe. Free breakfast.....What a nasty joke...I could barley eat a plate. In 10 days I ate there 1 time. YUK. Bathroom had gross black mildew all over the shower.....not to mention hot water ran out in about 10 minutes everyday. Lastly....The reason I wrote this........The dishonest bellman/taxi drivers. I have spent ALOT of time in Mexico City the past year, found some honest people and some people who see me and see $$$$. I understand, but it still makes me mad. Everyday I take a taxi from the hotel to the office in a metered cab. You get in to some the meter is already at $50 pesos, some $30...always random....But whatever. The exact same ride at the exact same time everyday costs me between $60-$150 pesos a way. I know however what I am going to pay becuase it shows right there on the meter. So its the last day of my trip and I need to the airport...There is 5 metered cabs sitting out front. Now remember, I have done the EXACT sames thing for the last 15 days and got a METERED CAB. The bellman calls the cab dirver over and tells me it is $150 pesos to the airport...I look at him and say no, I want this metered cab.(I know the ride to the airport is about 10 minutes and should cost aroundf $60-80 peso max). The bellman proceeds to tell me that these cabs all work for the hotel so they dont use their meters. SO I tell the bellman I will wait for a REAL metered cab...Which I have picked up from the same spot for 15 days str8. Cab after cab pulls up and he tells me the hotel has everyone of them hired. Finally I have to agree to the gouging in order to get to the airport on time. The bellman tells me, \"it will be $150 pesos, no more\" 1) I get into the cab and the cab driver and the bellman excahnge cash of some sort. I am sure this is the kickback one way or another. 2) I get to the airport and the cab driver tells me $185 pesos.......Remember, this trip is only a few miles, and I have done it for less than $100 pesos in the past. Bottom line, hotel is just OK...But dont trust anybody.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whistler, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSimply Amazing!\u201d", "Author": "Pablo_Contreras_R", "ReviewID": "UR120411625", "Content": "I stayed here for one night as I had to do some business at the WTC, so the location for me was important.

It's definitely a cheap, safe option that is close enough to walk to the WTC. However, the included breakfast is greasy, and the gym is the size of a single room, with only 1 working treadmill. The shower door often doesn't keep water from getting out into the rest of the bathroom, which means your commode is going to get wet. Be careful if you're already dressed after your shower & are in there! The carpet is worn and thin, and you often are waiting for the elevators during the morning/evening rush. (I take the stairs down, even from 5+ stories.) Even though breakfast & wireless internet are not *officially* included, I've always been able to get it for free during booking or upon check-in.

On this trip, I actually stayed in three Holiday Inn Express hotels during a recent 5 night business trip to Mexico. The Santa Fe and Toluca hotels were decent, with Santa Fe being the best. But the World Trade Center (WTC) Holiday Inn Express was awful. I was only there two nights on business but I had to switch rooms 3 times (twice in one day). The reason was there was no hot water in the room when I checked in to each room. This hotel is relatively new, only built in the last 2-3 years. At first I couldn't tell if it was a design defect or a human (lack of maintenance) error. But as a result of having the recurring problem and the fact that I am bilingual I was able to get the hotel maintenance staff to confess that they have to throw a switch/lever on each floor at the beginning of each shift to recirculate the cold water in the pipes with the warmer water from the floor's boiler. If they don't then only cold water runs to the rooms. The horrible thing was I only figured this out after the 3rd room switch and after I was infuriated that the manager claimed I was \"an isolated case\". Sorry, but it is statistically impossible to have the same person switch rooms 3 times, on two separate floors (6 and 7) in two consecutive days, and still have the same problem. Other mishaps were that the local free phone service does not work until you tell the front desk to take a block off the line. This is done because they can't trust the maids to not use the phones. Big red flag when the hotel management can't trust their own staff. Meanwhile the guest struggles with the phone lines until they are turned on. Management has no sense to turn off the blocked line when a guest checks in - making the guest do all the work to get the room functioning. Taxi service out in front of the hotel is not the secure and honest type of call-car service taxi (sitio) that exists in Mexico, because they charge whatever rate they want and they do not provide official receipts for the fare. This is illegal in Mexico and is synonymous of an arrangement that is typically done when the hotel manager has a \"kickback\" that comes from the taxi group. You are better off taking a taxi from the street, though the hotel is located on a side street that has minimal taxi flow making it even worse to find an alternative.

I think, ultimately, it is the best choice if you need to be near the WTC since the only other real option is the adjoining Crowne Plaza, which is probably plagued with the same issues and costs 2.5x as much. So let's start with the positives - great location for business at WTC, lots of security on the ground floor, decent food options in the Crowne Plaza (they essentially share one giant lobby/ground floor) and free breakfast. The rooms are pretty nice, too, with a very comfortable bed and a pretty good shower. They even include two free bottles of water. Unfortunately, there were a ton of small-ish problems that just piled up. First off, the free wifi was a joke - the longest I was able to stay connected was about 15 minutes in a row. This was a real problem for me, since I needed to access my work email and using the 3G on my phone was expensive roaming. My second problem came when I had dinner downstairs - I had pre-paid my room through Orbitz and they didn't ask for a card for incidentals, which apparently meant I couldn't charge dinner to my room. Of course, the wait staff wouldn't know this, so I went ahead and charged it to the room and then got a call at 9:30 that night to straighten it out. Then, despite the fact that I had my privacy lock on and my key in the wall, I got a very insistent knock from housekeeping VERY early the next morning. So, basically, I felt more like an annoyance to the staff than a valued customer. Also, there was an strange magenta stain on the rug. By contrast, the bellmen were probably the best service-oriented employees in the place. they rocked.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Playa del Carmen", "Title": "\u201cgood hotel next to World Trade Centre\u201d", "Author": "PlayaPalms", "ReviewID": "UR48636153", "Content": "This is a decent and clean hotel with good service just next to the World Trade Centre.

The hotel is very clean, well illuminated, the staff is nice. The best part of this hotel is that it's just across the street from the WTC and it is not expensive and includes free breakfast. Also it isn't fancy at all, they don't have a restaurant, nor room service or a bar. You don't need it... Next door from this hotel you see the Crowne Plaza, these two hotels are actually interconected. Just walk five steps from the Holiday Inn elevators and you're in the Crowne Plaza lobby, where there is a bar and a couple of restaurants. Even better, just walk across the street in opposite direction to the WTC and there's a drugstore, a convenience store (Corona beer for $0.60 USD a can) and a Mexican restaurant (Tortas Beto). Real Mexican food at cheap prices. I went to Tortas Beto a couple of nights for dinner and liked it. Also there are some restaurantes at the WTC as well as movie theatres. The hotel is just one block from Avenida Insurgentes one of the main avenues in Mexico City, there you can have a broader variety of restaurants and entertainment. Anyway, back to the hotel. There were 3 thread mills, and a spinning bike at the gym on first floor, just in front of the breakfast \"restaurant\". This was kind of funny because you can feel kind of guilty at breakfast if you see someone exercising. (I didn't see anyone when I went there). They have free high speed internet access (WiFi) and you can also pick up the signal from the Crowne Plaza. Also there are ice makers on floors 3,5 and 7 (remember the Coronas?) Beds in the Holiday Inn are comfortable, with plenty of pillows for those who care, and rooms are spacious. Well I saw that they also have small rooms. I was not bothered by the noise but I could hear some TVs on while walking down the hall. My ride to the airport took 16 minutes from the hotel but it was on a Saturday at noon. In Mexico City you should expect at least 80 minutes from the hotel to the airport on weekdays specially after 5 pm. Another note: this hotel is the hub for a low-cost Mexican airline(interjet), so you will always see people in the lobby waiting for the free shuttle to the Toluca(TLC) airport (not MEX). So if you have time to visit another city in Mexico it makes sense to lodge at the Holiday Inn. The Interjet shuttles can take you to the airport -you must have an Interjet air ticket to get the free ride. I hope this review is helpful for you. Please share your experiences too.
