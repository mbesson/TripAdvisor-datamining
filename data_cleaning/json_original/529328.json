The hotel is beautiful and rooms were a good size compared to most we've stayed in in big cities. Breakfast was lovely-lots of fresh fruit, the only criticism would be that you have to pay extra for juice, if not you just get water or coffee. There is a beautiful restaurant (Gli Ulivi) a couple of minutes walk from the hotel which we went to as recommended by another traveller.. try it its wonderful!! There are also a few nice bars near as well if you don't want to travel into Rome centre for dinner and drinks. Just to note the hotel is at the top of a hill, not too much of a problem as transport is available but if you wanted to walk back to the hotel then just be aware.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Home away from Home\u201d", "Author": "ShinBoy", "ReviewID": "UR115606303", "Content": "I booked the Villa Mangili for its location in relation to the Parco Della Musica (15mins walk), good reviews and fair price. I pretty much loved everything about the hotel, the size of the room (palacial compared to my poor colleagues' rooms who were staying in town), the breakfast, the building and garden, the security, the breakfast and the friendliness of the staff. Villa Mangili is an excellent home away from home and if I was in Rome again for business or pleasure I would certainly stay again. There is also an excellent restaurant nearby, Gli Ulivi, where I had the best Italian food I have ever tasted!", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wading River, NY", "Title": "\u201cLovely Stay\u201d", "Author": "travellover068", "ReviewID": "UR21609982", "Content": "We spent one night at Villa Mangili before moving to a villa that we had rented for the week.

Either the location (quiet, which is indeed an issue in Rome), the garden, the interior design and of course the entire staff make each stay a fabulous one. The concept is that they offer a home away from home which I can confirm 100%. Breakfast - especially compared to \"normal breakfast in Italian hotels\" - is impressive.

Situated near to the the Borghese Gardens which was ideally situated for access into the centre of the city. The hotel offered both peace and quiet after an exhausting trekk around the many amazing treasures of Rome. The staff, especially Massimo, we found to be genuinely friendly and extremely helpful.

Although it is not right in the centre, it was a pleasant walk across the Villa Borghese park or a short bus ride into the Centro Storico. It was lovely to wake up every morning to the sound of birds in the garden and not just traffic noise. the breakfasts wrer very good and the staff made us feel very welcome...such a nice change from the large hotels. We would certainly stay there again next time we are in Rome.", "Date": "May 21, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Villa Mangili", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d529328-Reviews-Villa_Mangili-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$170 - $239*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via G.
