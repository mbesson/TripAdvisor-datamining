I had three different rooms during my stay, all of which were horrible to stay in. The first room was 716, it had a two twin size beds and a mini-fridge which did not work at all. The air conditioner unit would give out after a couple hours of running and actually start heating the room. The windows opened and let in a nice breeze, but housekeeping would close them during the day making the room unbearably hot while I was away from the hotel. The second room was 306, the room had a queen size bed, but was a smoking room. (I am a non-smoker) The air conditioner in this room did not work at all. I left several notes on the thermostat requesting repair as well as asking at the front desk daily. They never did send anyone to fix this. The bathroom had a floor drain in it which would fill up with sewage water an leave a sickly odor in the entire room! The last room was not much better than the first. The air did not work and the hotel again did nothing to fix it. The hotel is located directly next door to a double set of train tracks which run by the hotel about every 5 minutes. Even with windows closed on the lower floors it was impossible not to be woken up during the night by these trains. (All room numbers ending in 10 or higher are on the train track side of the building, but the sound goes through the whole building!) The breakfast is a typical Asian style consisting mainly of breads. Lunch-meat cut style meats are not kept cool at all, just on a tray at room temperature all morning. Orange juice is watered down at least 90%, and barely resembles juice at all. 10th floor restaurant has very nice staff and pretty decent menu. Stay away from the ravioli though! Everything else I had was very good though. All meals range from 10-20 YTL (US $8-$16) a good price for what you get. A .5 liter can of soda was 5 YTL (US $4.15) at the restaurant or from the room mini-bar. Fortunately there is a very good priced convenience store just across the street called \"Takko Shop\" where you can get them for much less and put them in the mini-fridge. Don't expect to find any vending machines or any ice machines at this hotel. They do not have them. At check-out, hotel tried to charge me for alcohol they said I removed from the mini-bar. (very outrageous prices!) I told them that this was not possible as I have a severe allergy to alcohol which causes my face/neck/chest to break out into hives and can even affect my breathing. They argued with me on removing these charges. I told them I would be more than happy to have my doctor fax them medical proof of my allergy. (they finally gave in when I mentioned this.) I advise finding somewhere else to get laundry done other than the in house laundry service. The prices are outrageously high. Two months worth of laundry (1 jeans, 1 t-shirt, 1 underwear, and 1 socks daily) cost me 2000 YTL ($1653 USD with airport bank currency exchange.)
