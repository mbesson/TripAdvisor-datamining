{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Let's start with the door handle that came off in my hand. DON'T STAY HERE. This hotel bills itself a 3 star--not even close. I've stayed in many budget hotels in Italy that were far superior. First, the physical plant is simply worn out. Our traveling companions were moved to another hotel because the door and door frame to their room completely collapsed when they tried to unlock it. Needless to say, we didn't feel all that safe behind our door.The bedspreads were threadbare. The furniture was circa 1980 plastic kitsch, complete with some sort of stereo console between the beds that didn't work. The wall art would have been right at home at a yard sale. There was extra wall art--graffitti apparently drawn by previous inmates. My favorite was the bunny rabbit cartoon. The bathroom door handle came off in my hand. The towel racks were the white tubular plastic kind, and falling off the wall--we didn't even try to hand towels on them. Small trickle of tepid water for shower. The toilet had a formica-covered tank and a push-button flush that worked about 1 out of 3 pushes. The clean bath towels were stacked IN THE BIDET! Yuck.For fairness's sake: the staff were friendly and the breakfast was quite nice (except for the coffee out of a 7/11 machine).

Hotels can be expensive in Florence and it is difficult to find a comfortable hotel for a good price in this city. However, most hotels have their own charm This hotel, however, had no redeeming features whatsoever. It was very dirty, many things in the room were broken and the staff were unsympathetic when I complained. For, example, the room had a badly broken window with exposed glass, the sink was cracked, the fridge did not work, the air conditioning did not work at all, carpets and curtains were very badly stained, there was no hot water and all the cupboards / wardrobes were broken. For the second night I asked for a different room, but it also had the same problems other than the broken window. This is a filthy, disgusting hotel that should not be allowed to continue to operate. It certainly does not deserve the 3 stars it caries and is giving Florence a bad name by its very existence. The staff seemed surprised when I complained and were unhelpful. I did get half my money back via the web site that I used to book the hotel, but my stay had been ruined.", "Date": "Jan 1, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR898974681", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Visiting_Professor2"}, {"Content": "You have to shower over the toilet?!?!

This hotel should not be even operating. Apparently it's 3*. Joke! It shouldn't even have 1*. Firstly don't be fooled by the somewhat clean if dated appearance of the reception area. It gets so much worse. We were in a group so were occupying 3 rooms in total. Each one was worst than the other. In our room the air con wasn't working; it was 43 degrees outside. We could not open the window as it was overlooking a noisy street. The decor was so badly dated. The bed was a camp-bed, no more than that. The sheets were stained. The paintwork on the walls was in need of attention. The carpet was so dirty I would not walk around in my bare feet. At one point, whilst walking around the bed, I realised that I had walked into a hole in the ground which had been covered over by the carpet without being fixed. In our companions room next door the air con was working alright but when you turned it on it sounding like a 747 taking off. The carpet was soaking wet outside the en-suite door where there was obviously a leak that had not been attended too. The stink in the room was unbearable. None of us slept that night because it was so hot and grubby. The next morning we went down for breakfast. It was truly awful too, not even edible. We had booked in for 4 nights but decided we couldn't possibly cope with it any longer as it was so horrendous. Initially the hotel staff were hostile when we informed them of our decision. But when we listed our complaints they agreed to contact the online agent who we booked through. Notably the receptionist seemed to be quite familiar with the online agent as they were speaking over the phone. It was then suggested to us that we be upgraded to the hotel's 4* sister hotel around the corner and a member of the staff would take us around to the hotel to see if we were happy with it. We agreed to that. There was no comparison between the two. What a difference 1* makes in Italy!. We moved immediately and it saved what could have been a disaster of a stay in Florence.
