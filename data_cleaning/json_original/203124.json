The small balcony overlooked rooftops. Breakfast was a good selection of cereals, bread and pastries, yogurts, fruits and cheeses and unlimited tea, coffee and fruit juices. Galileo is a great base, we walked to most of the sights but got the metro home in the evening. It costs 1 euro for anywhere in the city.

We walked to the hotel from the station in less than ten minutes. Our room on the second floor was very clean with plenty of space and appeared to be recently redecorated. The bed was comfortable and the neighbourhood was quiet. The bathroom was quite roomy with a nice large shelf under the window. Unfortunately the doors on the usual miniscule Italian shower had a tendency to leave the track and swing loose. When we checked in we were sure we were told breakfast would be at 7.00, but the day we wanted to eat early to leave on a tour it didn't start until 7.30 and we were only able to grab a quick snack.

The room was clean, heating was good and bed was fine ... the positives ended there for us unfortunately. The shower was lukewarm at best, and when reception was notified we were told it was because other hotel guests might be using the hot water at the time. Even if this were so, surely this would mean it's an inadequate plumbing system for a hotel? We tried the shower at several times both in the morning and evening during the course of our stay, and it was the same every time. Also, the shower door in our room was broken so water splashed everywhere when using the shower. There was an electronic safe that was not connected and so could not be used, and we were also hoping for a kettle that wasn't there. Breakfast was very limited, and only begins at 7:30am so you will miss it if you have an early tour such as to Naples/Pompeii as we did. Also, if you get to the breakfast after 9am, your options may be limited - all the pastries were gone when we had a late breakfast one morning and they weren't replenished. When I asked about wifi, reception informed me that it was only available in the breakfast room at a cost of 5 Euro for 24 hours of usage. Luckily, our room had some (limited) wifi coverage to make it worth our while, otherwise I don't see how it can worthwhile to use in the breakfast room that is often locked. And in general, while the service wasn't outrightly bad, the staff didn't seem eager to help ... there was nobody to help with luggage upon checking in/out, and nobody to seat you at breakfast etc. It wasn't the worst hotel experience we ever had so that we would cut our stay short, but we won't be coming back.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunderland", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - good location & fabulous staff\u201d", "Author": "B3XDX", "ReviewID": "UR122428926", "Content": "Three of us stayed at Hotel Galileo for three nights starting Boxing Day this year. The location is brilliant. Like other reviews have said, just a short walk from Termini station and we even found we were able to walk to all major sites such as the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain etc too. The only time we needed to get transport was when visiting the Vatican. However, this was not a problem at all. The area the hotel is located in was great also, right in the city but no noise!! The hotel itself was lovely - exactly what you need. Yes, our room was slightly on the small side but our large en suite made up for this. The rooms were extremely clean and had excellent facilities. Continental breakfast is served in a large breakfast room which leads outside. Breakfast was lovely! However, the best part of this hotel was by far the staff. Always there to greet you with a massive smile, they were more than happy to go out of their way to help you with whatever you needed. The even went as far as arranging for the owner of a local restaurant we were planning on eating at to pick us up & drop us off. They were an absolute delight! One final note is regarding the tax. Some have complained about this & I'd just like to state that this has nothing to do with the hotel. Tax is paid at a rate of \u20ac2 per night for each tourist staying in Rome city. This was clearly outlined to us when booking and was also stated on the notice board within the hotel itself. A great time was had at Galileo & I'd definitely recommend.

Pros: Great value for money, location (with small children it's better if the station is close by), Breakfast is good. Room is clean and neat. Staff are always smiling and helpful.

This review is based on the fact it is a 3 star hotel. Out of all the hotels we stayed in only one 3 star hotel was better than this one, and that was the hotel Kyriad at Disneyland Paris. Any hotel around Disneyland i would expect superior excellence so Hotel Galileo was a clear standout amongst the others. Pros: Extremely helpful and welcoming staff. We were greeted with maps and advice and they had already helped confirm our pick up service before we asked them. This was easily the best experience from a staff point of view of all the hotels we stayed in. The room was modern, spacious and clean. The bathroom as as good as the other hotels ( bath and shower combined ). The breakfast spread was good. The room had air conditioning that worked well. The room was great and the staff made this clearly the best experience of the 3 star hotels we experience. The Disneyland hotel which was 3 stars only was better in the buffet breakfast and space point of view ( had plenty of space ). Close to Termini Station which is the Central train line in getting to and from Rome. It is also where many of the Tourist bus's operate from. Cons: None. Perhaps if trying to find the hotel on your own, then it might be slightly tricky. The hotels entrance is just off the street on the driveway that leads to its carpark. There are signs leading the way however might be missed by someone expecting the door on the front of the street.

Use the S.I.T bus shuttle service on the Via Marsala to get back to the airport - 8 euros each. Research affordable restaurants before you go. Pricing is extortionate in Rome for what you get. There are McDonalds abound if you're desperate and can get a Big Mac meal for 6.50.

The cab drivers took us for an expensive ride when we arrived, we soon worked out we could have done it with a 5 to 10 minute walk. I was a bit worried about the entrance, but is is very well lit, we were rarely back before dark. Helpful hint, laundrymat is just two blocks to the right, reasonably priced with internet access while you wait. Lots of little local restaurants, try the local lasagne's and pastas, just great!! I will be staying there again when return!!", "Date": "February 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nijmegen, Holland", "Title": "\u201cPrice / Quality perfect!\u201d", "Author": "El_Fregadero", "ReviewID": "UR54561781", "Content": "My girlfriend and I stayed in this hotel for a 10 day trip in Rome in July / August. We do think it is a very nice hotel, suited about 10 minutes walk from the central station of Rome (Termini) from where all trains, busses and metro's start / stop. The hotel itself is just great. Nice rooms which kept very clean. The beds are perfect if you like hard beds. My girlfriend and I just slept perfectley on these beds (we wished we had them at our home!). There is also a TV in the room, but it has mainly italian channels. The bathroom is just perfect. Nicely decorated and above all very functional. We liked the shower, but that's just personal. Service is good, the staf does always want to help you if you ask. They may seem a bit cold at the beginning, but if you try to speak a few word Italian they melt like a icecream in the (Roman) sun. The front desk helped us adequate on every question we asked. They were mostly doing their job with a smile. Ask them for tips to eat, they know the local hot spots and they are willing to share their knowledge with you if you ask. The breakfast is not abundant, but very good and tasty. Even my girlfriend liked it very much and she is a bit of a picky eater. Conclusion is that if we return in Rome (I'm planning to, but i'm not sure my girlfriend want to see it all again) we definitely will be returning at this hotel!.

The hotel is nothing luxurious, but it's comfortable for a short stay. The clerk spoke English. Breakfast was free every morning (bread, jam, cheese, cold meats, coffee, juice, etc.). The room was small but clean and had a safe inside the wardrobe. There is a VERY small elevator (can fit two people at a time or so), but the bellhops are nice enough to carry your bags up the steps if the elevator is full. Perhaps the best aspects of this hotel were the price and the location; the price is reasonable considering that your'e in Europe and so central to the train station. The station is only about a 10-minute walk, and other sites of interest are very close-by. (There are some Roman baths being excavated, for instance, on the way to the train station within about a five-minute walk from the hotel.) What I didn't like about the place is that it was rather dark and outdated-looking, and the bathrooms were poorly designed. Plus, if you're not used to washing with a detachable showerhead, you just might need to shower with help or the bathroom will be flooded! All in all, I would stay here again if I had to, but if I could find another clean place for a similar price, I'd probably check out something else.

We were booked into the hotel by our travel agency in Holand where we live. The reviews of the hotel were enough to scare us off, but we had already paid for the Hotel and there was little we could do. Overall the Hotel was not that nice, but not nearly as bad as we had feared. The rooms were small, and the bathroom very foolishly laid out. The toilet was next to the wall, and in front of the sink, so that if you bent over, you hit your head on the sink. You had to sit sideways on the toilet when you used it. We had the breakfast included at the hotel, but it was so bad that we skipped it two of the four days we were there. The \"coffee\" they served was shockingly bad. Imagine . . . really bad coffee in Italy. What a dissapointment. The outdoor seating area that they feature prominently in their brochure was closed for renovations and we ate our breakfast in their very cheesey dining room. Our bed was very bad, and we had to put the mattress on the floor in order to sleep - this worked out well for us, but was a pain in the neck to do every evening. The Hotel staff was helpful but not overly friendly - we didn't feel that we were made to feel welcome. If we could have changed our hotel, we would have. One good thing about this hotel was its location. A few minutes walk from the nearest Metro stop, and about a 10 minute walk from the \"terminus\" or central bus/metro station. This made getting around Rome fairly easy. There were probably 20 hotels within a five minute walk of our hotel, all of them pretty much the same style. There were a few nice ones but they were very pricy. If you are spending a lot of money on a trip to Rome, it would be a shame to have to stay in a mediocre hotel such as this one. Bite the bullett and stay at a Hilton.

The hotel Galileo is set back from the street in the center of a block surrounded by other buildings. All of the rooms are quiet and we had no trouble sleeping due to noise. Comfort was not the best, cleanliness spotty. The beds were old and mattresses sagged. Lots of dust everywhere. The shower had some mildew and drained too slowly. Toilet flushed with difficulty. The facility is generally tired and worn down, little things broken or missing (nobs on drawers, lamps not working). We woke up early one morning to go to Vatican city and breakfast crew arrived late--supposed to serve at 7 am and we had to wait a half hour. There was a lot of yelling and crabby waitress tossed our bread basket on the table without apology. Obvious management problems, and staff not happy.
