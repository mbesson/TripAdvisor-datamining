WOW was that a mistake.. This hotel was horrible. I do this in every hotel I stay at specially with the bed bug thing we've been hearing about. So I check the mattress and the head board b/c that is where these bugs are known to be found. WOW did I find bugs. I called down and reported this problem to the Manager on Duty and it took them over 30 minutes to respond so I to come to them. I pointed out to them and it seemed like they really didn't care it's like they are use to it. The manager looked @ another person in a suit and said to him \"ANOTHER ROOM\" how many rooms do you have like this? So we got another room on a different floor and Guess what??? This room had them too. So at this point I was like WTF. I was very upset and wanted to check out ASAP and go some where else. I was making conversation with an associate as I was waiting for the shuttle. The associate from the hotel said to me that this kind of thing happens all the time. They said that \"The owners are @ fought, they don't want to fix the problem they just to put a band aide on it.\" Theses Indian owners just care about the money coming in and don't care about fixing the issues around the hotel.\" Shame on you owners,shame on you.. this is why I will no longer stay with you though I am a very loyal guest to IHG.. If you are in the O'hare are DO NOT STAY @ THE HOLIDAY INN ON CUMBERLAND, STAY @ THE ROSEMONT, THE ONE WITH HARRY CARRY'S TAVERN.. MUCH BETTER HOTEL. YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED.

Holiday Inn is not a terribly shabby company, but I'm not expecting a Four Seasons or Marriott or even a Courtyard Marriott. However, despite my lowered expectations, I was disappointed. Honestly, if they could just fix some simple things, they would easily exceed 3 stars. Problems: 1) Shuttle took over an HOUR, not 10 minutes. Upon arrival at the airport, I called the hotel and they said a shuttle would be outside to pick me up at 9:00pm. At 8:50pm I stood outside in the below-freezing cold. No problem, really. Until 9:05 came around, and no van. 9:10pm. I call the hotel again. \"He'll be there in 10 minutes.\" OK, the chill is setting in, whatever, still no problem. I travel enough to know this happens. 9:30 now. Ok, this is getting ridiculous. 9:40pm. 9:50pm. Finally, the shuttle rolls around at 9:55pm to pick what is now a large group of people. So he couldn't fit everyone and had to leave some who had been waiting almost as long as I had. 2) No one answers Room Service. I call for Room Service. No answer. I dial the extension and also push the 'room service button' on the phone. Rings 20 times, no answer. It is 9:30pm, but they are apparently open until 1am. I call front desk, and he says 'I'll call you back in 2 minutes, take your order, and walk it over to them.' WOW. I thought things are looking up for this hotel. Except... no call back. 10 minutes go by, I try dialing room service again, and still it just rings and rings. I call hotel operator and they say they can't help me, and just connect me to the room service line that rings and rings. I give up. 3) Wake up call never comes despite request. I ask for a wake up call at 4:00am. (but I set my alarm on my phone just in case)... my phone wakes me up just before 4:00am... and I never get awake up call. Good thing I set my phone. I unfortunately cannot speak to its amenities. Some positives: I CAN tell you that check in and check out were quick and pleasant, and the bed was comfortable. The place was clean (not new, but clean) and sanitary (unlike other small hotel chains). Free wifi, which was very nice. So really, aside from some serious service issues, this hotel is okay. I was only here overnight because of an overnight layover, but if I had to do it again, staying here makes me want to just pay a few dollars extra and head to the Grand Hyatt O'Hare.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cWould definitely stay here again...\u201d", "Author": "Holldoll", "ReviewID": "UR123963479", "Content": "We stayed here prior to a flight out the following morning, and also because we could leave the car here free of charge for up to 14 days.

When I entered the room, there was an unpleasant smell of dampness and mildew. I first thought it was coming from the air conditioning unit but when I walked over to the unit the smell faded. I went into the bathroom and noticed some of the tiles were moldy. I opened the shower curtain to have a closer look and quickly discovered the source of the smell. The shower curtain liner was wet and smelled of mildew. I reported the issue to the front desk staff and requested a new shower curtain liner and for the tiles to be cleaned. I left my room for about 15 minutes to unload the car and bring my luggage inside. When I attempted to log on to the internet, I saw that it was password protected and they hadn't given me the code in my check materials. I also noticed I only had one breakfast coupon when I was staying three nights so I went back down to the front desk to ask for the breakfast coupons and get the internet access code. The same person who checked me in assisted me and after about a 10 minute wait gave me the items. I asked if my shower curtain liner had been checked and the clerk said the engineer had been to the room and he didn't see anything wrong with the shower curtain so they were not changing it. I said it's wet so obviously it wasn't changed before I checked into the hotel. He stated they didn't change the shower curtain liners between guest. I was dumbfounded because this practice is unhygienic and changing the liners seems to be a simple process as they have little button holes on them for quick removal/application. I said well if you don't change them in between guest then as a guest I would like to request for it to be change. He stated they wouldn't be changing the shower curtain at all. I stated this information would show up on their review and walked away. A customer service representative for the hotel happened to be standing at the front desk for my parting comment and came over to the elevator to ask if we could sit down and talk about the situation. I explained the situation. He was very nice and offered to upgrade me to a suite (which should have been offered at check in anyway since I am a Platinum Priority member and it's supposed to be offered if an upgrade is available). I looked at the room first and accepted the upgrade because it was my first time travelling to Chicago on business and I wasn't familiar with the hotels in the area.

I chose this hotel for its proximity to the 'L', ease of access off the interstate, free breakfast (included in the rate I had), free internet, and free parking. The hotel was across the road from the 'L' so I had no dealings with the shuttle. My room was clean with a very comfy bed, and the floor I was on was ok. You could clearly hear the noise from the planes, but I'd expected that when I booked, so I've no issues there. Check-in was very quick, but then it lacked any details except for my room number. Not even 'the elevators are over there', or 'breakfast starts at 0500'. Those details are always useful, as well as internet passwords and the fact that you can get to the overflow car park from the back door of the hotel, rather than walking up the ramp. At check-in I expressed my desire to be away from the live music accompanying the grand opening of the bar, to which I was told, 'well you're on that side of the hotel, but way down the other end so you won't hear the music'. Are you kidding me! It was like a rock concert in my room....so thanks for keeping me up until the police came and shut them up in the early hours! Luckily I only had to contend with one night's worth of noise, unlike the poor lady complaining at the desk in front of me, who'd suffered both nights and was being dismissed offhandedly. Breakfast was a hot buffet - French toast, sausage, bacon, potatoes & scrambled eggs, or order off the menu if you didn't have breakfast included. There was fresh melon and orange juice, but that's all that was out. The hot food was spot-on, so compliments to the chef on that front, but god help you if you wanted anything else. The breakfast staff spent their time between the register and the kitchen, although what they were doing exactly is a mystery to me....they'd not been near any guests to take anyone's order. You had to flag them down to get toast, cereal or even a glass of water; and that last request had them perplexed. 'Everyone's asking for water this morning' was her reply. It's triple digit heat outside, or people have been dehydrating in an aeroplane, so yes, people are gasping for a nice cold drink. P.S. the orange juice was warm. Once they found out you had a 'breakfast coupon', you were ignored even more if that's possible. Not once in 4 days was I asked 'would you like anything'......not even a cup of coffee!!!!

We stay at hotels that have a sleep and fly package. We decided to give this one a whirl. It was a little cheaper than some of the other places we stayed. After all, we just needed a place to lay our heads before our early morning flight. Upon arrival, we discovered the bar downstairs was packed and noisy. We were on the 11th floor so we knew the noise wouldn't disturb our slumber. It wasn't until the next day that the trouble with this hotel started. We were going to take the 7am shuttle but we were ready early and thought we'd go ahead and allow a little extra time and take the 6:30am shuttle (arriving 15 minutes early). I'm thankful that we did. We waited... and waited... and waited. After an hour, the shuttle arrived. The driver said the other driver didn't show up and he ran out of gas and had to stop to fill up! Then we look at the van that held 9 people. At this point 12 people needed to go to the airport! I said to the driver \"Why don't we take the bigger shuttle?\" and pointed at a big shuttle in the parking lot. The guy explained there were three shuttles that size all broken down and they only had this small van. We all managed to pile in with all our luggage (surely breaking a few laws in the process) and got to the airport. Things didn't get any better when we came back. We got off our plane, claimed our luggage and called the hotel for pick up. We were told they would be there at 7:30 at door 2. We waited until 7:45 and called again. They explained it was door two on the lower level. They said the shuttle would be there again at 8. We sprinted to their specified door 2 and waited and waited and waited. We called the hotel at 8:25 and asked if the shuttle was running late. The guy was adament that the shuttle was on time. At 8:45, they finally arrived. But it doesn't end there... we arrive back to the hotel only to find a huge stage and a tent set up in front of the loading area at the front door. They had a live band playing! The parking lot was out of control and we could barely get our vehicle loaded in order to leave in all the chaos. At that point, I was glad we weren't staying the night and we felt bad for those who were.

Remote control for TV had low battery so I called front desk-new one brought in about 10 minutes. Early 1990\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bathroom-nothing special with tub/shower combo, toilet, and sink. Ameniteis provided and restocked second morning. Shower had rain head which was nice. Upgraded to Executive level since Priority Platinum member-always a nice treat. Rate included buffet breakfast each morning and 2 drink coupons. Breakfast is one area for improvement. Buffet consists of scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage links, French toast, potatoes, and a few types of breads and juices plus coffee or tea. Food was ok, but it would be nice to have eggs made to order like in European hotel breakfast buffets. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth $12.95, but since it was included in rate and only about $5 more per person than the rate w/o breakfast, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complain too much. Everyone at desk and in restaurant very helpful. We were allowed to check in 2 \u00c2\u00bd hours early. Guy forgot to give me my drink coupons and breakfast coupons but I was rushing him since I had to be downtown in less than an hour so not his fault. When we returned, I stopped by the front desk and was given the coupons. A/C worked well. Near Cumberland L stop so we decided to take from O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare since we were buying a 24 hour pass anyway and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to wait on shuttle. It is a nice hike-best route by crossing bus drop off area and then narrow sidewalk next to parking garage to cross Cumberland at entrance to I-90 and then down Cumberland to just past the hotel and then through hotel parking lot. Obstacles: Parking garage, crossing Cumberland at only one intersection, and fence around hotel preventing a short cut. It was not too bad. We also did it about midnight on Saturday, and the area was well lit and safe. We took shuttle to airport on Sunday morning and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait more than 5 minutes since it was already loading up. I had a tip ready for shuttle driver, but he hopped off bus to help someone else get their luggage and just pointed to our airline so no tip given. There was some banging on one of the doors nearby about 2 am the last night, but no one bothered us. There was a guy wandering around 11th floor at midnight on our return with ice on his shoulder. He went into the Executive Lounge so I went in also to see if there were any free soft drinks or anything, but nothing. I think he was in the room next door where the banging would occur later. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why the lounge was unlocked. It was simple with sofa, chairs, and a regular bathroom-not too businesslike, in my opinion. To summarize, it was a good hotel and served its purpose. The staff were all professional. Those at the front desk were well trained in customer satisfaction. The restaurant staff were enthusiastic but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak perfect English or understand college football, which was our purpose for this trip. I would stay here again if in the area.

TO begin the horrible experience, only one bus showed up at the end of the night after we had been promised two for months and months. When i arrived at the hotel, the board room in which the ladies got ready in was locked. We were told that they could keep their things in there and could get them whenever we got back to the hotel. Not the case as the rude staff told us that they couldn't unlock it without a manager. ALSO, we were told that the bar would be open until 1:30 AM. This was very important to me because my father-in-law had stated that he would finally be able to relax when he had a drink at the bar. However, the bar was closed and as I was talking to one of the front desk guys, another one walks over and says \"What now...\" This is where i had them call their manager. It is not suitable for a guest service clerk to speak to someone who just brought your company 30 plus reservations for a wedding. So Mario the manager shows up and is even less helpful. He tells me he will take care of it on Monday and offers me no solutions what so ever. Finally we get to our bridal suite that we booked a year ago and it is laughable! we booked a bridal suite and they put us in a one room exec suite in which the AC didn't work and the sink clogged up. When I called Mario again he told me there were no rooms available and there was nothing he would do for me. I asked him for his general manager's name (Jamal) and number to which he said he refused to give me his contact information and that none of his staff would give me that info either. This is where my wife starts to cry (horrible ending to seriously a perfect day). Finally we are moved to a room where the AC at least works but only because it took my father-in-law to go speak with them.

They provide a shuttle to close locations, so they were more than willing to drop me off at the Donald E Stephens Convention Center. The rooms were decently sized, the bathrooms were large, and there was a coffee pot. Downsides on the room: the channels on the TV were very limited, and didn't include a channel guide so I had no way of knowing what programs were on. The TV was also an older TV (not a flat panel) which is rare to see in 3 star or above hotels.... most hotels have switched over to flat panels. Also, the air conditioner was very very loud and it was difficult to control the temperature... it was either too warm or too cold, since you couldn't actually set a temperature, so I had to constantly fuss with the dial. There was also a strange smell that reminded me of diapers in the hallway. I had 2 very big problems with the hotel, other than the minor things mentioned above. The first is that I was there from a Thursday through Sunday, prepaid, but they deactivated my keys on Friday. I had to leave my friends and my belongings in the hallway and go back downstairs to get a new key made. The hotel claimed that my key became deactivated by a credit card or my phone, but my boyfriend's key was also deactivated... he's local and had to work until 3am, so when he showed up at my room to cuddle he had to wake me up so I could let him in. Sunday was the worst. My boyfriend wasn't able to see me off to the train station, so he left flowers at the front desk for me. They didn't call to let me know. When I checked out, I did so by calling down to the front desk since I didn't have to pay, and I spoke with an actual person instead of leaving a message, but I wasn't told about the flowers. They should've had my number on file as well, but didn't call me to let me know even after I checked out. 3 hours after I checked out, my boyfriend let it slip that I shouldn't received a surprise... when I called the hotel, they told me \"Yeah, you have flowers.\" At that point, I was already boarding my train and had no way to go back. While the hotel itself was nice, the lack of courtesy at the front desk would be enough to make me avoid the hotel.

They store your luggage after check out until your plane leaves. The airport shuttles are convenient. One even dropped us off at the train station while it was pouring down rain. The only fault is the service is not as frequent as I would like. They are suppose to run every half hour, but it seemed to take longer than that at times. We waited quite a bit at the airport upon arrival and on our return as well. Overall, the rooms were well stocked, but I had to ask the staff for extra coffee every morning. They only supply enough for one cup per guest each morning. I like two. Overall, this is a very good value for the money. The only fault I see in regards to value is the price of breakfast and meals in general. The breakfast at the hotel is around $15 per person. It is very good, but overpriced.

I didn't want to spend a fortune on an unexpected hotel stay. My Friday night rate, inclusive of taxes, was $109.75 which, for Chicago, is a real deal. The linens on the King-sized bed were luxurious. The room was large and had many amenities - working clock radio, fridge, microwave, coffee maker and fixins. The bathroom had a large vanity area - black granite-like counter with Garden Botanika soaps, lotion, cleanser and shampoo. Tub had a curved shower rod which made the shower more spacious - also had an oversized adjustable shower head. Another commentor below mentioned there were no room-darkening drapes. Perhaps his room didn't, but mine had a separate set of darkening drapes that you pulled over the sheer drapes. As a stressed out traveler arriving at the end of a long day, the room was a godsend. Lobby is gorgeous - lots of dark wood and polished black and white \"marble\" flooring - looks like an English manor house. Three (or four, can't quite remember) elevators in good shape with wood, brass and mirrors. Hallways are a bit dingy. Shuttle drivers were very friendly and did an amazing job remembering who had what bags - which made things very efficient upon arrival at the airport in the morning. Shuttles leave the hotel on the hour and half-hour, 24-hours a day. They were right on time. Picking up the shuttle at the airport was kind of frustrating. You pick it up in front of the Hilton's entrance - at the shuttle center - which is a zoo. There are several Holiday Inn shuttles and you need to be careful to wait for one that says Cumberland Ave on it. The Cumberland shuttle seemed to take forever to arrive - whereas there were numerous other Holiday Inn shuttles that came and went. So be prepared to wait up to a half hour. Having said that, the shuttle was very comfortable, the driver friendly and the trip to the hotel uneventful. The hotel advertises they are 2 mi and 5 minutes from the airport. It may be 2 mi as the crow flies, but the trip takes at least 10 minutes - and may take you longer individually depending on which terminal you use. Allow at least 15 minutes (with no traffic problems). As a female traveling alone, I was also happy to see that the hotel's clientele were seniors, families, business travelers and even flight crews.

When our team arrived, our coaches got us checked in and distributed the room keys to us, and we proceeded to go upstairs to our designated rooms. (This 11-story hotel has 3 pretty quick elevators, so we never had to wait too long to get from floor to floor.) We got off the elevator on our floor, 6, which we quickly found out was the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smoking floor. The smoke smell in the hallway was pretty overpowering. Luckily, our room, 615, was the first room on the right once you got off the elevator. The smell was still perceivable in the room, but it was definitely milder than it was in the hallway. The funny thing about the room was that it was a one-bedroom suite with one queen bed in the bedroom. Since we were already cramming 4 people in each room, we were expecting a room with two double beds. Our coaches talked to the desk staff and found out that it was being taken care of; they were sending a rollaway bed up. So now we had a queen bed, a sofa bed, and a rollaway bed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enough to sleep three of the four of us. Luckily, one of us didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind sleeping on the floor (he said he actually sleeps better on the floor than in a bed or on a couch), so that kind of worked itself out. What I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand is this: the reservations had been in the system for several months (they had probably already been made in late \u00e2\u20ac\u212207), so how did they run out of non-smoking rooms with two double beds AND non-smoking one-bedroom suites? Did every guest in that hotel for those nights honestly have a reservation dating as far back as the National Academic Championship reservations? (I can only assume that the people in charge of our reservations would have booked us all non-smoking rooms; we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re high school students, after all.) Besides the issue of cigarette smoke, the room itself wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too bad. There was no wired internet access, but the wireless worked fine, despite being just a bit slow. The furniture was kind of beaten-up but still functional, and the carpet, though really dark and dated, appeared clean. The bathroom was pretty roomy, and the bathtub was perfectly clean. The one thing that grossed me out a little was this: one time when I used a tissue to dry off a drop of water I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d spilled on the bathroom floor, the tissue came up grayish-black, reflecting a poor cleaning job on the part of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housekeeping people. The floor didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t LOOK dirty, but I guess that was an illusion created by the type of tile they used. The moral: wear shoes when you walk into the bathroom. (The bathroom door also had some very weird-looking damage near the bottom of it [see photo], but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s merely cosmetic and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t affect the cleanliness or functionality of the room, so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really see it as a huge negative.) The hotel is located very close to the O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare airport, which can be really convenient for travelers... until you try to get to sleep. Planes flew right over the hotel frequently, 24/7. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s noisy, old, window-style air conditioning unit helped drown out some of the plane noise, so I got to sleep after a while. When I woke up, I found that despite the great selection of pillows, the bed itself hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly been great on my back. They probably decided to use the same old mattresses that the hotel had been using as a Ramada, which probably date back to the days when it was a Clarion. We had the only suite out of everyone from our school, so it was basically our meeting place whenever we needed to get together for breakfasts, practices, or just relaxation/downtime. The first two mornings, we had breakfast in the suite; our assistant coach went to Dominick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (right across the interstate from the hotel) and got milk, juice, doughnuts, bagels, and other items so we could eat right in our room without paying the ungodly $12.95 per person for the basic breakfast buffet offered by the hotel. The in-room mini-fridge and microwave proved very useful for this; we could just store the milk and juice in there until breakfast the next day. The third morning, we did eat at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakfast buffet, which had a decent variety and tasted excellent. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d call it $12.95 worth of food, as Holiday Inn Expresses offer a wider variety of similar-quality items for free every day, but it was definitely satisfying. We also ate at the lunch buffet at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant on the second day; the food was amazing. They offered salad with fresh, healthy-looking lettuce and a variety of dressings; pasta with alfredo and spicy marinara sauces available; delicious well-seasoned grilled chicken breasts that tasted like they just came off the grill; and bread and butter. (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m probably forgetting something, but everything I had was incredibly good, and I can be kind of a picky eater sometimes.) One night we thought about taking a swim in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153heated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd outdoor pool, but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem very heated at all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c way too cold to swim in, for sure. On the opposite end of the scale, though, were the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s common areas near the meeting rooms on the second floor. I guess the A/C must not have been working or something, but it was ridiculously hot and humid outside the Ontario and Huron rooms. It was just as hot most of the time inside Ontario and Superior A. The other rooms we used (Superior B and C and Michigan) were fine. (We never used the Huron room, so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know about the temperature of that room.) I also swung by the fitness center on the second floor just to check it out, and despite both window A/C units being on their coldest temperatures and highest fan settings, the room felt pretty warm. Our assistant coach, a Priority Club member, mentioned to us that she wanted to see if she could get the Priority Club points for all of our rooms put on her account. (She wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the one who had paid for the rooms, but the person who had paid for them wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a Priority Club member or just had no interest in getting the points.) I mentioned that I was also a Priority Club member, and she agreed that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d take the points for my suite and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d take the points for our group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other rooms. She managed to get the points put on her account by talking to the front desk. I tried to do so later on, but the woman at the front desk didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem very informed. She told me that it was impossible to give the points to anyone except the person who paid for the rooms, which is obviously untrue, as our assistant coach was able to do that just fine. I feel like she was just trying to get rid of me because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just a kid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m 18 years old, but I understand that some people mistakenly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t view us as part of the adult community yet); she obviously wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to even try to do it, despite my telling her about how our assistant coach was able to do this with one quick visit to the front desk, so I had to walk away without the points. Overall, our stay wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too bad, but if I were choosing the hotel next time, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay here again. The biggest problem is one that the hotel can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really help \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the location, right under the flight path of loud airplanes going to and coming from O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but besides that, there are so many little things (cold pool, unfriendly and/or uninformed desk staff, air conditioning problems, dirty bathroom floor, uncomfortable mattress, etc.) that would still keep me from returning.", "Date": "June 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rural Belgium", "Title": "\u201cA very friendly welcome next door to busy airport...\u201d", "Author": "Nossi", "ReviewID": "UR16471810", "Content": "Walked in after a long road trip looking for a night's accommodation before returning to Europe, and - despite the front desk being busy with large corporates (various airline crews checking out), I got a very genuine welcome from the Indian front desk manager and was offered a competitive rate.
