The hotel itself is nice, clean with comfortable beds. Staff was friendly, helpful and efficient. But the location can't be beat if you are attending a late night game or concert. Camp Nou holds 98,000 people so being within walking distance is a real plus- no waiting in line at the metro.

To top it off, FC Barcelona won La Liga when we were there, so we had front-row tickets to the open-top bus procession with the football team onboard on our terrace - a nice addition to the stay :-) I'd recommend the hotel if you don't intend on spending ALL your time in there, as it's a bit stuffy.....other than that, great value and i'd stay again.

The Nou Camp Stadium is a 5 minute walk which we could see from our window. There is a couple of wee local bars across the road which we had a few jars in usually before we headed out for the night or on the way home, they were pretty friendly too.
