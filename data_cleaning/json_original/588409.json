We had a villa with the 5m x 3m (approx) plunge pool and enjoyed being able to take a dip whenever we pleased. The grounds and central pool which boasts waterfalls and rock pools are beautiful. We were so impressed that we nominated the gardener as the employee we wanted acknowledged by the hotel this month. The staff, as always were friendly and helpful and our room was always kept to a high standard of cleanliness. For us a few changes would improve the overall experience even more. We would love to see some steps put in the plunge pools to make entry less of a splashing affair. We also would like to see a better choice of tv channels as most were either in indonesian or japanese. The inclusion of a dvd and cd player would also be great - having some music playing was what we missed in our beautiful private courtyard. Finally, making the indoor bathroom more private, (it is very open, especially if you have room service or guests visit when you are using the bathroom) would be a great improvement. Overall this was a lovely week and I would recommend these villas in Sanur if you are looking to get away from the bigger hotels.", "Date": "Jan 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR588540482", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "SOOz-Trip"}, {"Content": "Loved it!

The staff are very helpful and friendly, the food delicious and the grounds amazing full of tropical plants and flowers. It has a very private and personal feel to it (only 18 Villas) and is only a 2 minute walk away from Sanur Beach where you'll find the Parigata Beach Club.We stayed in the Executive Villa which has an outdoor living area, it's own pool with jacuzzi and an outdoor shower. We were impressed with our private plunge pool as it was larger than we expected and had a jacuzzi built in, fantastic after a busy day sightseeing. Inside the villa was well maintained and tastefully decorated with a mosquito net over the bed, essential for someone who gets bitten all to easily!We managed to also have a look in one of the standard villas and found them to be smaller versions of our villa with the exception of no outside living area and just a jacuzzi instead of a plunge pool, but if you're on a smaller budget they are excellent value for money.The main pool area was beautiful and had a poolside bar that served an array of drinks and snacks. Breakfast was of a good standard with plenty to chose from and is served in an outside dining area overlooking the gardens.There are plenty of good restaurant near the villas, our favourite was Casa Luna, the food and service exceptional and they have Balinese dancing on certain nights of the week.", "Date": "Oct 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR453205837", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "RachyPea"}, {"Content": "Lovely, intimate resort!
