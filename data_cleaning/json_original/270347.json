It's definetly the best for the money. For only 5.50 you can get an amazing half pound cheeseburger and 7.50 for special cheeseburger such as bacon.

We did this and I also called again in July to reconfirm our reservations. When we arrived the girls at the front desk had given our room away and put us in another room that I had to climb up stairs to. My wife found some pebbles in the bathroom floor and called house keeping to clean it up. In the mean time she sat in one of the chairs in the room and the bottom fell out. Again she called and they said the guy coming to clean the room would take care of it. He did come and go into the bathroom but wife said he didn't get all the pebbles up and he did bring another chair. The rooms are still a value but the folks running the desk are just not dependable anymore.

It could have been updated, but for the price in Branson, it was fine. We were out on the town most of the time. The biggest \"plus\" at the motel is the staff who really try to please their guests. Fridges and microwaves were available on request (if available) and Randy, the manager, was super- he got us both for our room. They're not always available- and I carried the microwave from another unoccupied room- but we had both for our stay. Don't expect a Radisson or Mariott, but if you're looking for a reasonable place with a reasonable price, and nice folks as management, this is the place. I'd also recommend Chester's restaurant next door for breakfast. Two breakfasts with a lot of food, two coffees, and juice came to less than $20- which is the average price in Branson...", "Date": "October 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "oregon", "Title": "\u201cI love this bar!!!\u201d", "Author": "hauntedbars", "ReviewID": "UR42202291", "Content": "Great karaoke bar we had lots of fun !!! rumors that hillbilly inn is haunted made for a fun stay at the motel... you never know what you might see!!!", "Date": "September 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sanibel, FL", "Title": "\u201cHillbilly Inn Good Value\u201d", "Author": "sanibeltravler", "ReviewID": "UR21459799", "Content": "The Hillbilly Inn was a clean, affordable accommodation.

When I was finally given a key, I regreted the effort! This was a run down dump and I'll never go back!
