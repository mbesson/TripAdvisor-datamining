For European standards, the rooms were a decent size and shower pressure pretty good. The rooms were clean, beds comfortable and the bathrooms pretty modern. The cappucino machine in the lower floor where our group ate breakfast every day was outstanding: best coffee I've ever had. The location of the hotel is nice/quiet because you set back into the hill a bit, away from the constant ambulance and police sirens that you typically hear in Rome, if you have a car, motorbike/scooters or a bus. If you want to have other restaurants/bars within walking distance, this may not be your best bet. The prices in the gift shop are reasonable the owners of the shop were very friendly and sincere. The internet will cost you 7 Euros for 1 hour 20 Euros for 1 day. There are two \"stations\" in the lobby for internet, so you may experience a line-up if the hotel is near capacity. The windows of the rooms on the bottom floor cannot be opened, so if you like extra ventilation or a breeze at night, ask to be put on the second or higher floor. The pool was not open for us during our stay because the Italians consider it too cold to swim in April. There is a nice exercise room, though.

This hotel proved a base for a very good trip. However, as can be seen from some of the other reviews the hotel is by no means perfect although some of the criticisms described elsewhere did not match my experience. Positives:- * the receptionist team were always cheerful, helpful and excellent * rooms were of good size, clean and well maintained * the restaurant food was generally good - yes quite expensive but nothing out of the ordinary in an Italian hotel from my experience * reliable shuttle bus which only took 20 mins to get into the centre of Rome (but there was no traffic on the roads in the middle of August) * the pool is an excellent facility Negatives * All staff not quite so attentive - at breakfast staff had a remarkable ability to avoid eye contact * The bar lacks atmosphere and whilst it is supposed to open at 7pm it was opened at 7.30ish by someone who seemed to be a bit frustrated that a few residents might want a drink * I was prepared for the distance from central Rome - however the fact that the hotel really is in the middle of no-where (general scrubland / a few residential houses) meant that you couldn;t walk out to a local shop or bar.

Waitresses seemed pretty stroppy and were in no hurry to help.

I will have to fight with a \"travel agent\" at TripDucky after we return home to get my money back. The hotel lobby has been renovated and is modern looking, though tacky. It is a facade. The rooms and hallways have disgusting old carpet that is literally threadbare. My chair seat and bedspread had gross stains on them. The room smelled musty and dusty on entry. I complained about the dust and dirtyness of the room to the front desk right away, and they supposedly cleaned while we were at a very expensive dinner in their restaurant (there is nowhere else to go). Upon return, though, my room still smelled of dust. They didn't change the pillow cases as I had asked them to do, and the stained bedspread had been put back on the bed. The dinner was very expensive - 14 Euros for an average plate of spaghetti. My Dad's \"spicy pasta,\" which turned out to be a fish stock dish, was inedible; it was extremely salty and fishy. There were only three waiters who were rushing around, avoiding our eyes so we could not request help. They never once checked on us. We finally flagged down another waiter and told him to take the offending meal off the bill, and bring us the darn bill so we could get out of there. An awful first night in Rome. One HUGE problem - do not discount this - is this hotel's really INCONVENIENT location FAR outside of central Rome, which is why it's cheap.

We paid 30 Euros the next morning to get us to another hotel in the heart of Rome arranged by my WONDERFUL travel agent, John Clifford (John@InternationalTravelManagement.com). Other problems: My parents' safe wouldn't work; their room near the elevator was extremely noisy - you could really hear people talking out by the elevator and in the rooms on either side; my internet access wouldn't work (they sent up 2 men with terrible body odor who couldn't fix it, then sent the front desk attendant who did). My internet connection was very slow. I think it was 12 Euros for a 24 hour period. There was no water available to buy in the hotel \"store\"; the bar charged 3 Euros one time to buy a bottle, and 4 Euros the following morning on our way out. I asked the Melia hotel manager to arrange for a taxi to get us out of there and to our next hotel, but of course she refused. She wanted me to sit down with her and explain why I thought our rooms were dirty. Please! As if I hadn't been inconvenienced enough. It is so much better to find a small clean hotel in the center of Rome to stay. The Metro is terrific and easy to navigate, but I like best the hop on/hop off buses that circle Rome and drop you off at all the major sights. Have a wonderful trip in Rome....just don't stay at the awful Melia!

Upon arrival at just gone 12.00pm, we checked in and were offered the opportunity to include breakfast (which was not part of our booking) as well as upgrading to a superior room for and all for an extra 30 euros per night. When told \"no thank you\", we were told the room was not available until after 2.00pm, however the superior room was available stgraight away. When finally checked into the room, I was mortified to learn that they do not offer an iron in the room but they do offer a laundry service which of course you have to pay for. This was quite expensive. Instead, I went and purchased an iron from a shop in the Vatican City for 14 euros which was much less expensive than paying for the hotel to press my clothes. The hotel has a resturant which we didn't use (very pricey) and they also have a bar where you can purchase snacks like burger and chips, pizza etc but again, prices are high. There was no tea or coffee facility within the room and the TV only has 5 channels and luckily one of these was BBC worldwide. The walls were thin as you could hear people in the shower next door! Internet was available but for a price. Shop on site but again, expensive (8 euros for a fridge magnet). Shuttle bus to the Vatican City was handy as otherwise you would be stuck but this also meant either eating at the hotel in the evening or staying out all day to eat in the city before returning to the hotel. At times, the bus was very busy but we had no problem in getting a seat. On a positive note - the cleaners were very good and even folded my pyjarma top! Overall - hotel was ok but for the price paid, I expected more. It felt like they would charge for anything - I did check that weren't charged for the toilet rolls! The hotel is also a conference centre and so is used by people on business which is what it felt like the hotel was more aimed at. Remember - take your own iron (and adaptor).", "Date": "September 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAn excellent way to see Rome\u201d", "Author": "olson182", "ReviewID": "UR79693914", "Content": "The Melia Rome Aurelia Antica hotel was a fantastic choice for me and my girlfriend to see Rome.

At the end of a tiring day in Rome, you dont want to come back to a dark, dank dingy hotel with substandard accomondation, and at the Melia, you can rest assured you wont. To address the issue of location, which is a natural one that people keep bringing up, we caught the shuttle bus a total of 9 times, missed the bus once (8:30pm), and had one occasion where we were the last 2 people on (10 am). A taxi from Ottaviano to the hotel set us back 13 euro, and one to the nearest metro from the hotel, maybe 10euro. In our book, shelling out 13Euro once out of 10 trips was well worth it. Quite a crush on one of our morning trips though, a lot of shoving and people jockeying for best position, we had one character who held down the entire back row...Melia management cant be blamed if fheir guests are total cretins I guess. Another inconvience that goes along with this is that catching the shuttle means dinner in Ottaviano as there is not much near the hotel (minor inconvenience, there are a couple of places in Ottaviano that were great, look for the guy who has the newspaper article outside his restartaraunt talking about his restaraut in LA). Melia management- You should implement some type of a first come, first served ticket system from the hotel to ensure those lining up first are not forced out, which I observed happened on a few occasions. Also at peak periods (8am-10am), (8:30pm-10:30pm), consider 1 bus every 45 mins, and a bus every 2 hours outside these times- thats when your peak load is!

I would recommend going to a local store in Rome centre and buying alcohol from there if you are really bothered about having a drink. We used the Terrorvision bus service to get to Ciampino airport, brilliant value at 8 euro return and we simply got the metro from Ottaviano on the Red Metro line direct to Termini to catch this service. Prior to our departure we emailed the hotel to request that we could catch the shuttle bus in order to check in and the response was very fast and included a copy of the shuttle bus timetable which we thought was brilliant.

Me, and my wife took this trip to celebrate our last piece of freedom as we are expecting our first child in 4 months, so we were not really looking for night life, or staying out late, and after reading many of the reviews on TA decided to give this hotel a try. Pros: Breakfast package: We got the breakfast package with our room, this allowed us to get breakfast before we headed into the city, this added a convenience, as we did not have to worry about finding food before heading out, and since the hotel is out in the middle of no where you will not have any other options. The breakfast was decent, and provided everything me and my wife needed, meat, fruits, toast, coffee, juice, water, etc. We would occasionally take a banana or two back into the room, for a snack. If you do not get the breakfast package, its 16 Euros per person, which is a total rip-off, and definitely not worth it. Room: For a European Hotel, the Rooms are large, spacious, clean. When we looked out our window on the 4th floor we saw sheep grazing, and a lot of open space. Hence, at night it was very easy to sleep, or go out for a stroll (While avoiding all the smokers standing in the front) Shuttle: For us the shuttle worked great. We timed the shuttle accordingly and did not have to worry about much. There are both positive and negative sides to the shuttle, but for the time being I will focus on the positives. The day we decided to visit the Vatican, the shuttle worked perfect, we got off ottaviano, and just walked 10 minutes to the vatican. Things to be Aware of: Getting there the first time: Getting to the Hotel the first time, can be the biggest hassle, especially if it is your first time in ITaly. If you are flying into FCO, this is the information we hope someone would have given to us. To get to the Hotel, email them ahead of time and ask them for the time the Shuttle picks up from the city center. When you fly in pay for the Leonardo Express tickets from the Airport right now its (14E per person) make sure you validate it, or you will be charged a penalty of 50 Euros on the train, trust me, we've seen it happen and it will ruin your trip. You can also get your return tix to FCO at that time, just don't validate it. Only validate the ticket you are using to get you to the city at the machine, and when you are on your way back validate the other. Its cheaper to buy it at the airport, than at termini, 2 euros cheaper per couple. The train leaves every 15 minutes. Take the Leonard Express to Termini, and then take line A to Ottaviano, which is an additional 1 Euro. When you get to Ottaviano you want to be in front of this little store called MetroBar. There you can wait for the Shuttle. It is a large Coach Bus, with the name of the Hotel on it. That is the cheapest and easiest way. Note: The shuttle is not exact, and can be +/- 10 minutes based on traffic. Hotel Restaurant: The Hotel Restaurant is extremely expensive, and for sub-par food. Recommendation, before you return to the Hotel, there are markets at Termini Station, and around Ottaviano, buy some bread, wine, cooked meats (whole fryers), and food, and take it back with you, it will cost less than 10 euros, and will feed at least two people for the night. Packaged Breakfast: As mentioned above, I had the packaged breakfast, most of the days we stayed there we would go down around 930 to breakfast, and it was great, few people fresh food, however the day we were leaving, we went down at 7AM and realized its a big no, no at that time, thats when all the tour groups, and conferences, etc are down there, and it is a mad rush, they run out of food, and you have to wait in line, etc. If you wait till the crowds leave around 830 and moving forward, you can eat breakfast in peace, with no wait on anything, and still manage to take the shuttle to Ottaviano, headache free. Internet: The mother of all rip-offs, they will charge you, 12e in your room for a 24 hour period. if you are doing basic emails you can go to the lobby and pay 2e for each 15 minutes. still a rip, but when you are out there, and you don't have any other option you use it. My recommendation, setup skype on your computer, and call the US for free on the internet, makes you feel a little bit better about 12 Euros a day. on the good news, there is free printing downstairs, so if you pay the 2 euros for the 15 minutes you can easily check in for your flight and print your boarding pass. which is completely worth it. Television: If youre like us, and will be back in the room by 20:30 and looking for something to kill time like watching TV, forget it. There is absolutely nothing on except CNN, BCC, and a couple of other news channels, and thats it, everything else you have to pay. Shuttle: The bad thing about the shuttle is it ends relatively early, and if the hotel is busy the last shuttle is a free for all. for us we were home by 20:30 and so it was a non-issue. but if you do want to come home later, your cheapest route, will be take a cab from Cornelia metro stop, where you would normally take the 892 bus, and it will cost you 15e to get back to the hotel. In conclusion: There are definitely some limitations with this Hotel based on its location, however for what we were looking to do, and our circumstance, it was perfect. I would love to see the internet rate cheaper, but its a sellers market when it comes to internet where they are located. If I came back to Rome, I would stay there again.", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cNice, Somewhat Posh Hotel Off the Beaten Path\u201d", "Author": "MKB1701", "ReviewID": "UR63736332", "Content": "I booked this hotel based upon my positive experience in Melia Berlin and the fact that I got a killer package online with Travelocity. I also liked the fact that with Melia, you get all of the amenities one would expect at a nicer American hotel (A/C, elevator, minibar) The hotel itself didn't disappoint. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and aside from the tub with the absurdly high step-in (if you have mobility issues, be sure to ask about this - it's that high) everything was perfectly lovely. The lobby was nice, decor was pleasing, and as for prices at the hotel bar and restaurant, hey, it's in a hotel - what did you expect? Actually, my girlfriend and I had dinner at the restaurant, and we had a great meal with drinks for approximately 75 bucks - in other words, standard NYC/London/Paris prices. The only rubs I had were the inadequate breakfasts (7 bucks for a roll and coffee isn't acceptable anywhere) and the expensive Internet service that we paid for that didn't work. As for the location, yeah, it's out of the way. Public transport is practically non-existent (the 892 bus to the Metro can charitably be described as capricious) and the ride down the hills is very rough, so again, if you're not the hardiest traveler or prefer your transit on the plusher side, this isn't a good option. During our 4 days there the shuttle ran reasonably well and on time, but it got stuck in traffic once (hence the bus trip) and it runs infrequently. If you want to stay out at night, you need to take a cab; they cost us about 18 Euro from the city center. On the plus side, however, it's in the middle of nowhere, so it's quiet and you'll get a good night's sleep. In regard to the lines other travelers described, we only had a problem once with people not being let on. You know the way we made sure we didn't run into any problems - we showed up early! Barring any large tour groups or parties, you'll have a seat if you show up 10 minutes before the bus is supposed to leave from the hotel and from the pickup by Ottaviano, add another 10 minutes on, especially at night. What I liked the most about this place was that I got a premium hotel for pennies on the dollar with built-in rest assured thanks to the location. If you separate the hotel from the location, it's an absolute winner, and if you have a private car, it should be a no-brainer. If not, well, that's where priorities come in. If you don't mind the shuttles, paying for the occasional cab, and value a good night of sleep, Melia is for you.

Our first big problem was getting from Ciampino airport to the hotel. Our flight landed 21:40 at Ciampino airport. The public transport from Ciampino airport to Rome central is very limited. We booked tickets on the Terravision bus service to Termini station. The first bus departing from Ciampino airport was at 22:30 and with the 40 minute bus ride we only arrived at Termini station around 23:15. According to our planning we would have taken the metro A line to the last station and then get bus 246 that would have taken us 700m from the hotel. The end result we were too late for the metro and we had to take a cab. Maybe this was a blessing as the hotel is situated in a location which could be quite difficult to find. A cab from Termini to the hotel is about 35 euros. We only arrived at the hotel midnight. We stayed in a superior room. The room was great! It was spacious, clean, had a new bathroom, nice LCD TV and very comfortable bed. The drinks in the mini bar were very pricy and therefore we avoided it. The breakfast which was included in our price, was average and I would have expected more from a hotel of this price and standard. It is however better than the most European hotel breakfasts. What soured our trip to Rome was the travelling between the hotel and central Rome. It was a nightmare! The first morning we had our breakfast so that we could catch the 10:00 shuttle bus. We were 15 minutes before the time waiting for the bus. Just after 10 the hotel staff came out and told us the bus already left as it was full. We walked to the nearest train station (approx 1km) and caught one of the busses from there. It took us about an hour to get to central Rome. That was not too bad. Getting back to the hotel shuttle bus (which only goes every 1.5 hours and the last one back at night is 10pm) can accommodate approximately 60 people, and the hotel has 270 rooms. So if you make the calculations you will see the chance of the bus being full every time is very good. That night we then decided to take the 892 bus from Cornelia station to the hotel. We waited for 30 minutes and then decided we will walk to next bus stop. At the next bus stop we took the same bus as that morning with the idea it will drop us at the station near the hotel. From the station you have to walk through the university ground to get the hotel. We did not think of the fact that the university grounds will be locked. After one of the Italian citizens felt sorry for us and taking us back to the hotel by car, it took us 2,5 hours to get from central Rome to the hotel. The next day we then decided to try the shuttle bus, but again that was full. We then stuck to the 892 bus. The 892 bus is the best alternative to the hotel shuttle bus, but you need to be patient when waiting for this bus. We could not find a timetable and therefore we waited sometimes only 5 minutes and other times up to 35 minutes. Eventually we used taxis, but that is an expensive option! Overall, whilst the room was nice and staff friendly, the location of this hotel (and infrequent shuttle service) mean that I would not recommend staying here if you want to go into the city of Rome and see the sights.

The room was lovely, clean new bathroom and comfortable bed. However, it was very hot and stuffy and the fan/air conditioning did not seem to work - it was only April so I don't know what it would be like in the summer. The windows couldn't be opened. The worst thing about the hotel was the location. if you have a car it would have been ok, but if not you rely on the hotel shuttle bus (which only goes every 1.5 hours and the last one back at night is 10pm - and was full both nights we tried to use it so we had to get a cab for 15 euros anyway and another morning it was full and we had to wait another 1.5 horus to get to the city). There is a local bus, but it is infrequent, and you have to be prepared with tickets before you get on (which you CANNOT buy from the hotel - so really have to get them from the station the day before) so not really an option for us as we didn't expect to need the tickets as we assumed we could get the hotel bus into the city. The breakfast which was included in our price, was average and I would have expected more from a hotel of this price and standard.

Good points about the hotel. All the staff were very helpful and pleasant, our lack of Italian was not a problem as the staff we encountered all spoke some English. The rooms were very nice, clean and tidy and the hotel was quiet at night so we had no trouble sleeping. The hotel ran a bus shuttle into Rome, stopping right next to the metro link at Cipro Musei Vaticani, first bus in to Rome from the hotel was at 08:00 hours, the last bus back at night was 22:00 hours, with numerous shuttle trips throughout each day, each trip took about 20 mins. The only bad points for the hotel was that the food was dear if you bought any that was not already included in the price of the hotel, and the bar drinks seemed a bit steep at 16 euros for two medium glasses of beer, although you did get crisps and nuts with your beer at the bar. The location is a bit out of the way if you are travelling from Ciampino airport, a taxi would cost you 55 - 60 euros each way. We used the Terravision bus service from Ciampino airport into the main Stazione Rome central terminal for the coaches and trains, cost 4 euro's in and 6 euro's out, tickets bought at the airport and in the coach terminal, run roughly every half hour each way. Taxi from the vatican on the Friday night was 30 euro's, but if we had known about the shuttle pick up point, we would have used that as it wasn't far from the vatican. This was our first visit to Rome and we spent as much time as we could seeing the sights, you need good walking shoes as some of the paths are very uneven and you could sprain an ankle very easily. The traffic was hectic to say the least and you have to have your wits about you every time you cross the road. Heard alot about pick pockets but did not encounter any problems, all the bar staff and restaurant staff were nice and pleasant and again spoke English. Used the metro links which was efficient and cheap enough, bought a day pass for 4 euro's. Monuments and fountains did not disappoint, did a guided tour of the Colosseum and the Roman forum for just 16 euro's which was a bargain. Tour guides were excellent and the two tours lasted about 3 hours, you also jumped the long queues of people waiting to get in at both sites so this was well worth the money. Did not bother with the vatican museum as time was short on this trip and we were told that you need more than a full day to take everything in, although we did spend a couple of hours in St Peter's.", "Date": "February 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat service, great hotel\u201d", "Author": "LondonJc83", "ReviewID": "UR55092253", "Content": "From the second we stepped in to the second we stepped out, we were looked after.

But I was asked to do some work near Melia Aurelia Antica Hotel on 21 October, and, seeing the good reports in Tripadvisor on that hotel, asked to be booked there for two nights, with checkout on 22 October. So, we were not disappointed by the hotel's distance from the center of Rome, the inadequate shuttle service, or the \u20ac50 per day it would have cost us to commute by taxi to central Rome. The room, a superior double, and ensuite bath were good sized, adequately furnished, and seemed fairly clean. The bed was large and comfortable; the linens good. The room was quiet. It was ready when we arrived and was made up well the next day. But the room was permeated by the stench of cigarette butts (though they had been removed). Moreover, when we arrived in late afternoon, sunlight was pouring in, the windows were closed, and the room was hot. I asked about the air conditioning, and was told that the single system for the whole hotel had been changed to heating, and that I should open a window. The window opened only narrowly. I would have asked for a switch to cleaner-smelling room not exposed to the afternoon sun, but we did not have time for that. Next morning, we realized that the side of the bathtub was so high that neither of us could easily step in and out of it, and that there was no grab bar to help. We had to help each other in and out of the tub and needed to be careful to avoid slipping on its wet, rounded bottom. The cheapest way to use a computer in the lobby for a few minutes was to buy a 40-minute card for \u20ac10. The included buffet breakfast was adequate in the variety of foods, but the quality was only acceptable, not very good. There are no eating places or delis outside the hotel within easy walking distance. The hotel restaurant has a very limited menu, with generally acceptable but not excellent food and beverages, served in smallish portions at high prices. None of the makings of a mixed salad my wife ordered were fresh and crisp, and some were decadent. But when she pointed that out to the waiter and asked him to take it back, he angrily asserted that there was nothing wrong with the salad. When she insisted, he removed it, but the \u20ac12 charge for it was included in our bill, and only removed when I appealed it to the front office manager at check out. When checking out, we asked the clerk to call a taxi for the airport. We were then told that by the front office manager that he had called our hosts the previous day and been told that they would pay only the charges for the room itself. The hotel manager should have raised that issue with us the previous evening. Lacking time to resolve it, I paid the bill and got a receipt. But the hotel\u2019s printer was working so poorly that the receipt was barely legible.

We did, on one occasion, witness a couple being asked to leave the bus due to lack of seats on the 830pm bus; they apparently don't let you stand. The breakfast is worth adding to your trip. It has a wide variety of foods including bowls of fresh, mixed fruit, yoghurts, nuts and bread rolls. You also get the choice of an 'American style' breakfast, with sausages and scrambled eggs. The one area that let the hotel down was the restaurant. The meals were fairly expensive and the drinks were extortionate! We paid 14 euros for a small glass of wine and a 250ml bottle of Becks! When we did have a meal at the restaurant, we were forced to choose from the 'short menu' and was given a choice from a very small number of meals read out to us by the very disinterested waiter. We both ordered the lasagne, costing 13 euros, and received what was clearly the corner of a pre-made, larger lasagne, heated up with no extra vegetables or sides.

This proved great value and we utilised this on the excellent continental breakfast each day. An fantastic advantage of staying here is the swimming pool. Many of the central hotels in Rome don't offer this luxury, and after a day of walking round the Coliseum, it is great to be able to plunge into cool waters. The room was big and spacious, very clean with a great bathroom, and nicely air-conditioned. As previously mentioned, our one concern was the shuttle bus, so much so that prior to leaving the UK we arranged to pick up a hire car from the airport. This turned out to be a slight waste of money! The shuttle bus is frequent enough, and although the last pick up from the city centre is 22:30, we found a cheap way round the solution... Most tourists who go to Rome utilise the cheap 3 or 7 day underground passes. These are fantastic value and I strongly recommend getting one. If you miss the last shuttle, take the tube to the end of the line and from there you will be able to get a cab (not speaking the lingo isn't a problem as we got ours by walking into a restaurant who were kind enough to order one for us).

We got a great deal from Melia Aurelia, it was 50 \u20ac per night including breakfast (which was really nice). We knew the location is bad, but the hotel has a shuttle bus service and that sold Melia Aurelia for us. Huge mistake. Hotel says in their websites that thay don\u00b4t guarentee that you get the seat from the bus, but still, it suppose to be 4 star hotel, so you would think that they don\u00b4t advertise someting they really can\u00b4t deliver especially when the location is difficult and most of the customers are quite dependent on this bus \"service\". The shuttle bus \"service\" is a big joke so I advice everybody who are thinking to book a room from this hotel: Don\u00b4t count on the bus service, book this hotel ONLY if you have a own car. The shuttle bus was full almost every time we try to get in. One night we were coming back from the town and it was the last bus going to hotel 10 pm from Ottaviano metrostation, and there was three times more people waiting the bus than what the bus can take. People were pushing and shouting to get in to bus, it was really awful. Half of the family might got in the bus and the other half didn\u00b4t, and that\u00b4s it, nothing you can do. You can\u00b4t keep seats even to your children. The whole situation was so humiliating, normal people (young and old) fighting and screaming to get in the bus!!!! How any hotel can offer this kind of \"service\" for it\u00b4s customers???? It beats me. So never again for us or any of our friend who are going to Rome. Since the hotel is in middle of nowhere (really, closest shops and restaurants are probably 3-5 km from the hotel) you can see this difficult location also in prices in hotels restautants and bars; cola costs 5 euros, normal drinks cost 11,50 \u20ac. There is a shop in the hotel, but you can\u00b4t buy even a bottle of water from there, they only sell postcards and other turist junk. Otherwise, rooms were roomy and quiet and pool area was great after long day at the town.

We did not eat or drink at the hotel although the menu for the restaurant looked good and was priced reasonably when compared with eating out in Rome itself. The bar prices were a bit steep but there was a nice outside seating area just opposite. The hotel shuttle bus was a necessity for us. The journey took between 15 and 25 minutes depending on traffic and dropped off at the Ottaviano metro stop. For three of the four days we stayed the bus was a plain white 34 seater with the hotel name on a piece of A4 paper in the windscreen which filled up very quickly. On the fourth day a much larger 57 seater single decker coach was operating which had the hotel branding displayed all over! I did not ask but I presume the larger bus was being serviced or something meaning the smaller bus was only a temporary stand-in. I would advise you turn up at least 20 to 30 minutes before the bus you want to get (in either direction) as a lot of people were using the service and throughout our stay there were almost always people left behind to wait on the next bus. The hotel's no standing rule was very striclty enforced by the drivers. If the larger bus is always used this is unlikey to be such a problem. For the price I paid for the hotel I could not be happier. I booked through Tiscali Travel (powered by Expedia) who gave me a voucher code (now expired) which meant my four nights stay only cost \u00a3205.97 - far cheaper that most hotels in Rome.

A nice thing is the restaurant, I've always found their food much better than one would expect from a hotel restaurant. (Perhaps American hotels' restaurants have lowered my expectations.) An annoying thing is their internet, which is rather expensive and seems to come with gigabyte limits. I didn't spring for that. I also think that the hotel needs to spruce things up a little: I've seen it getting just a little shaggier (paint, etc.) since I started coming to it.

As we sat by the pool one afternoon, several other guests remarked to us that they experienced the same awful behavior from staff so it was clear that it wasn't just our family's experience. The final straw came when a lifeguard was so rude to me that I just couldn't believe it. My young daughter was wearing a plain white t-shirt in the pool over her bathing suit because she was sunburned. The lifeguard yelled at us and told me she had to take it off. I told him she was sunburned and mentioned that there was another child in the pool earlier wearing a t shirt over their suit and he didn't have a problem with that. He then yelled at me and said \"I am the lifeguard!\" I was so upset about the way he spoke to me -- completely uncalled for and out of line.

After another 10 minutes and still no meal, the manager came over and said 10 more minutes. He also acted very indignant, as if we were completely out of line asking him to check on it. It finally arrived after a full 40 minutes, and was cold as ice. It should also be mentioned that there were only 3 other tables occupied at that time so it wasn't like the place was extremely busy. The poolside food/bar service was terribly slow although the food was fine. When my mother wanted to get part of her sandwich wrapped up to bring to her room because she couldn't finish it, she was told \"no, that's not allowed.\" Because the hotel is on the outskirts of Rome, they have a shuttle bus to take you to and from the city. But it basically runs every 90 minutes, and if there are too many people waiting, then you don't get on -- which means you'd have to take a taxi into town or back to the hotel which cost approximately 25 Euro. It would be much more helpful if it ran a little more frequently. For internet service there is a charge of 10 Euro for forty minutes of use. There is a billiard table but you are also charged 10 Euro per hour. There was a charge for using an iron. We needed information about local buses, no one at the front desk knew the answer. We asked about a local church, again no one on staff knew where to find one. How can you have a staff that isn't familar with the local area? There is no real concierge to help you. The only decent thing was their breakfast buffet every morning; a lot of choices and there was one hostess there who was very nice. However, it is not included in the price of the room unless you pay extra. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone, especially families. They don't know the first thing about hospitality nor do they care. If we hadn't pre-paid through the travel agency, I would have checked out after the second day. With so many choices of hotels in Rome, this one is definitely not worth it on any level.", "Date": "August 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gothenburg", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Service!!\u201d", "Author": "Banfila", "ReviewID": "UR18433435", "Content": "The good things - the breakfast is very good and the rooms are good and air conditioned. However, the hotel service and the practicalities of staying here ruins everything. First this hotel is out of town so you rely on the hotel for all meals. They have an expensive menu which seemed to be dedicated to foreigners since we saw Italians having a cheap buffet and we were told they were allowed that because they have a special contract at the hotel. Then I wanted to iron my trousers but the hotel would not give me an Iron because apparently, it is against Italian law. The only way was to get a lady to iron them which they charged for and added a 30% charge for wanting them back the same day. For the record, the next hotel I stayed at had no problems giving me an Iron. You can use the hotel bus to go to town but you have to run on their schedule. If you are an independent sort of person this can be a little annoying since you are pretty stuck out there. You could get a taxi but the hotel has to call the taxi and here's the most annoying this about the whole transport issue and Rome itself. Taxi drivers are there to exploit foreigners. They start the meter when they receive the call, apparently. By the time they are at the hotel you are generally between 4 - 6 Euros down before you even get into the cab. The taxi meter in Rome is just an instrument of thievery. The taxi drivers tell you the reading is Km when they want to charge you a higher euro price. There are lot of tricks. The hotel does not take care to make sure that the taxi service that they use is good for their customers. Contrast with the hotel we stayed in after that, all the taxis they use are ensured by the hotel to be fair. Many occasions I saw many guests arguing or getting fed up with the hotel staff for one problem or another. Lastly, after we got fed up and checked out early and moved to a city hotel, I forgot my running shoes at the hotel. Two days and nobody called to tell me they had found it. Then we rang and one staff told us the found it. Then we rang again to arrange a pick up and the next staff swore they had not seen it. Not worth staying here even for the pool. Stay in town.

My husband and i stayed for 4 nights in July 08. Definitely a 4 star as it says. Good sized, clean rooms and the hotel staff are very friendly, providing correct and accurate advice as needed. Maid service everyday. I would recommend this hotel but due to the location you do need to get the courtesy bus into the city centre as it is a way out with not much in the nearby vicinity. However i knew this when booking the hotel from previous Tripadvisor reviews and the bus is on time and always enough seats so it wasn't a problem for us. Bus is approx every hour in and out of city. The out-of-town location is more than made up for in the reduced rates of the rooms (compared to hotels right in the city centre) and there is no traffic noise/disturbance when you go to bed which i suspect you would get closer into the city. We ate in the hotel some nights and some nights in the city, so can vouch for the hotel food. Very good service, quality and good selection on menu. The free glass of champagne in hotel restaurant on arrival for meal was a nice touch. The nights we ate out, we decided not to get the hotel bus home (last bus 11pm) and caught a taxi instead. Taxi ranks easy to find. From where the bus drops you in the Vatican district of the city the taxi ride back to the hotel was 20 Euros so not too bad. It's worth going out just to meet the locals and get some local/ traditional food/drink. We did lots of sightseeing whilst in Rome and I would say 3 or 4 days is enough to see all the major sights. July is hot to be walking about in the heat (35c) so would perhaps recommend to say my mum&dad to go in the spring or autumn when it's not so intense. If we came back to Rome again I would not have any qualms about booking this hotel again and would recommend it to others as a good base. My biggest criticism is the pool bar prices, majorly expensive but then Rome is a very expensive city. The cash machine in the hotel did come in handy!

I do have a few comments: We did not have the coffee maker in the room like the other reviewer said. I have mix feeling about this. Regular American coffee (coffee maker) and instant coffee are very common in US hotels but I think it could be blasphemy for the people who invented both the espresso and cappuccino. I think if they would provide hot water and also an ice maker would be great improvement. The air condition unit in the room gets too hot when it is cold outside. I think the heat/cool cross over could be set a little lower. We had to open the windows and the outside temperature was very nice. Not enough hot water when the hotel is full. April 25 was holiday and we noticed that the hot water ran out quickly when there were a big group of people checked in. While shuttle service was great but I could foresee problem when too many people count on the same time slot. We did not have any problem while we were there. Maybe in the summer, when the hotel would be fully booked. It could fill up an entire coach bus. However, the tour group should not be a problem since they would have their own bus anyway.

We have stayed in Rome several times and this is by far the best hotel we have stayed in. There are some drawbacks - travel time to Rome, non-availability of local shops, and costly internet - but we felt that these were outweighed by the positives. Check-in and cleanng staff are very pleasant and friendly - everyone makes a point of saying hi, which is great in a city like Rome where service staff are usually jaded and act like they hate tourists. The front desk staff gave us a ton of local travel info and helpful advice. And the room cleaning staff even cleaned our rooms late one evening, when we were having dinner, after a day when we had spent the whole time in the room. Breakfast is great - very large selection of foods, and the coffee is great (as you'd expect in Italy!). Make sure hat breakfat in included in your room price or it will be pricey (9 euros to 15 euros depending on continental or full). The bar coffee is pricey - 3.5 euros for a caffelatte, which in town would cost you little more than 1 euro. The restaurant is overpriced - hors d'oeuvres start at 10 euros, main dishes start at around 13 euros. Room service incurs a 9 euro charge. Newspapers - Italian papers and the Wall Street Journal are free to take to your room, and are also available in the breakfast room. It is a bit far out - the shuttle bus (always on time) runs every 1h15mins, even though local buses to the metro stop run from just outside the hotel every 20mins so you can always take one of those instead of waiting around. The shuttle bus ride takes 20-30mins to the Vatican area, depending on traffic. But it was great after a day in bustling Rome to get back to a quiet, clean and modern hotel in pleasant surroundings.

The main negative aspect of staying here is clearly the remoteness from the centre of Rome. The shuttle bus is quite big and spacious, but simply does not run enough journeys during the day! And the fact that there are no runs into town between 5.30pm and 9pm makes it impossible to return to the hotel for an afternoon rest and then go back into Rome for an evening meal - quite unacceptable. Infact, the shuttle bus times seem to be designed to suit the driver, not the hotel guests. The superior room we had was on the top (6th) floor, overlooking the back, so was fairly quiet, with only minor background traffic noise from a road some distance away. Unfrotunately the bed was rock hard and very uncomfortable for those who - like myself - are of bigger size. Fortunately, there was a sofa-bed in the room, and that was actually more comfortable! The TV channels had only two that were English speaking: CNN and Euronews. The third one - that wasn't working - was Sky News. Quite unbelievable for a 4 star hotel! Although we stayed in March, when the weather was already quite mild, the heating was switched on at full power, and the corridors of the hotel floors were oppressively hot. Predicatbly, the hotel rooms had no access to air conditioning, only heating. Quite absurd, given Rome's balmy mediterrenean location. the The other negative feature is the apparent unreliability of the alarm call service. We booked a wake up call for 8.20am on the morning of our departure, and the call arrived at 6.20am - a rude awakening, to put it mildly. On the positive side, the hotel restaurant was extremely good - one of the best I've ever tried. The food was simply wonderful, from beginning to the end, and the service of a very good standard. I certainly didn't find the restaurant too formal, simply polite and respectful - after all this is a 4 star hotel and not Butlins! We chose the special four course set dinner and were charged 76 Euros for the the two of us, (discounted from 84 Euros) - I consider that to represent excellent value for money. Certainly not expensive, given that this must be one of the best restaurants in Rome. The breakfast in the morning was also quite good, with a lot of choice, although the service was chaotic. The only let down - and this was quite a serious one - was the lack of proper bacon and sausages - they only offered a very thinly cut fried pancetta and some tasteless boiled frankfurters. And the scrambled eggs were obviously fried with oil rather than butter - this made them greasy and not very tasty. So the cooked part of the breakfast is totally inadequate for an Anglo-Saxon clientele, though the rest of it was actually very nice, with plenty of fruit, yoghurts and croissants of every type. Overall, the hotel was a great disappointment and I will not consider staying there again. The restaurant was the only high point, everything else a let down. My overall impression is that this hotel is well suited to Italian business people but not for foreign tourists seeking a pleasant stay.", "Date": "March 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, England", "Title": "\u201cOut on alimb, but saved by the bus\u201d", "Author": "cook0005", "ReviewID": "UR6787136", "Content": "I stayed here for one night on business.

They do put on a courtesy bus for free, though it does get too busy in the peak summer, when we went in october it was fairly empty. The bus goes into rome about 7 times a day (picking up returnees at the same drop off point) With this you have to plan your day in Rome, but we found the best thing to do was go in at 8 am to the Vatican or 9:15 to the Piazza Vincenza (both really good locations for sight-seeing), then come home at 4:15 or 6 pm, and return at 9 for dinner, and then got picked back up at 11pm, so it worked out fairly well if you timed yourself. It usually takes a flat fee (set by Rome's council) of 40 euros to get there by taxi from the airport, but our taxi driver back to the airport charged us just 32. The courtesy bus avoids the hazards of public transport in Rome, which is rife with pickpockets (my fiance's aunt and friends reported being pickpocketed on the bus to the vatican city in separate incidents) so it might seem a problem being so far out, it's actually very useful utilizing the bus. The weather in Rome at that time of year was just turning to the wet and colder side, though for most of our week there it was warm and dry. This means the pool is closed after September, which I was disappointed by, so I would recommend going in September to get weather which is moderately warm and quieter buses. The staff were friendly and helpful, and able to speak English fairly well. The room was clean and spaceous, with air-conditioning, and a fridge/mini-bar which we stocked with our own drinks/food. There was also a TV with 25 channels including english CNN, french and MTV Europe.

The room we were assigned was intended for handicapped accessibility (only king size, no smoking room available). The room was very nice and quite large with a large marble tiled bath. The room had large windows but very poor lighting in the bedroom area. We also noted that our room had no clock or alarm. The breakfast selection was quite good with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, vegetables, assorted meats and cheeses, assorted rolls, juices, fruit, yogurt and cereals. However, the scrambled eggs were very runny and the bacon, although tasty, was undercooked as well. I had to really pick through the bacon to find some that was the least bit crispy. The bacon and eggs were also just on the lukewarm side and not really hot. The hotel runs a shuttle bus into Rome but the shuttle schedule is not very convenient. We found that the shuttle ride into Rome in the morning took about an hour to get to the drop off location. Please note that the drop off is no longer in front of the Bernini hotel as noted in other reviews. The route has been changed and the drop off location is now just behind the Victor Emmanual Monument in the Capitol Hill Area. While I don't recall all the shuttle times, I do recall that there is an 8:00 AM shuttle to the Vatican Area and a 9:30 AM shuttle to the Capitol Hill area. Coming home in the evening there is a 6:15, 9:30 and 11:00 shuttle from the Capitol Hill drop spot. The shuttles busses are large coach busses which hold about 54 passengers. On our first night there, the 9:30 shuttle had more riders than seats. Because they will not allow people to stand on the bus, several people were unable to get on the shuttle and had to take a taxi back to the hotel (they didn't want to wait for the 11:00 shuttle). I'm not sure what the taxi ride would have cost but I would guess it would be in the 20-30 euro range because the hotel is quite a distance from the Rome city center. Rome is a busy and noisy city and bustling with tourists and pickpockets. So I enjoyed staying out of town a bit where it was more quiet and we felt more secure. Although the shuttle service was a nice benefit I must say that the shuttle time schedule was not very convenient. The shuttle ride could take anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes and there were large gaps in the shuttle pick up and drop off times. Therefore going back to the hotel in the afternoon for a break was not really an option because of the few shuttle times available and the length of the shuttle ride. Also, 6:15 PM was earlier than we wanted to leave Rome and 9:30 PM was later. Somewhere in the 8:00 or 8:30 PM range would have been nice but was not available.

We arrived at this site and then followed the link through hotels.com and got a fantastic deal compared with what we would have paid through their own website. Apart from our nightmare journey to the hotel on the first night everything was fine. NOTE.. if you are arriving on the late Ryanair flight into Ciampino Airport (11.35pm), you need to note the following information. We booked our bus trip into Rome city centre through Terrovision (they sell tickets for the transfers on Ryanair), they dropped us all off at a spot a couple of minutes from Termini train station and then left us all there. Most people obviously knew where they were going and soon left. it was quite deserted apart from a few people hanging around. We needed to find a taxi as this hotel is a way out and the shuttle bus stops at 11.00pm. I was annoyed with Terrovision the way they just left everyone, they should have at least left us in a place where there was a taxi rank. After much walking around the train station with no taxi rank in sight, we exhaustedly accepted a taxi ride from an un-licensed taxi cab, this was a last resort as we were tired and didn't know where we were. We did agree a price before we got in, don't pay more that 30 euros. We paid 30 although the hotel aferwards said it should have 25. We got in this car which was so, so small that we were cramped up with luggage and it was really uncomfortable. The first problem was, the driver did not know where the hotel was, didn't know the area and had to phone the hotel for directions umpteen times. We were driven all over the place, he kept stopping and asking for directions and then kept driving everyhwre, it was a nightmare journey in this cramped excuse for a car. After an hour and a half of driving around and many calls to the hotel, he found it and we got out. fair enough he was apologetic enough and didn't try and rip us off on the agreed price but it was an awful start to our journey. The flight is late enough without having another long journey driving around the back streets of Rome. Word of warning DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS WE DID. The hotel can arrange for a taxi to collect you from Termini if you call the hotel when you get on the bus at the airpot they will send a proper taxi to meet you off. If only we know this beforehand however the benefit of our experience may help others. the bus journey from Ciampino to Rome centre takes 30 minutes the drive to the hotel from the centre only takes about 22 minutes. The taxi should cost you no more than 25 Euro's. if you arrive earlier of course you can use the hotel free shuttle bus which is excellent. The hotel is luxurious the staff are lovely so helpful and speak good English. The shuttle bus is great and takes you either to Rome centre or the Vatican. they give you a timetable when you arrive a the hotel. It is always on time too. We never experienced any overcrowding but we got the later buses in after having an early morning swim and stayed until late. There is a nice little gift shop in the hotel and the man who works there is a like a tourist guide himself. He will tell you all the places to visit which the book dosen't. the rooms are spacious and clean. the hotel is quite expensive be warned. The mini bar is 4 euros for a sof drink and 8 euros for spirits as is the main bar bay the pool. 11 euros for a gin and tonic and although the measures are huge, it is quite pricey. If you want an alcoholic drink at the poolside bar, choose a glass of wine at 4 euros. The outside bar is open until midnight and they nice piano music overlooking the lit up gardens and pool. The pool is huge and clean, there is a life guard. The staff are nice and helpful and the surroundings beautiful, it is lovely and quiet and relaxing after a long day in Rome and the shuttle bus is the perfect way to enjoy this hotel which is a way out. We had dinner on the last night which is pricey too, but added touches like complimentary glass of sparking wine and a little caviar dish, nice biscuits at the end makes up for it. The meal cost us 85 euros, but that included a bottle of red wine, 2 coffees, 2 deserts and 2 main courses, so roughly 30 Pounds each for a really nice dinner with wine and dessert.
