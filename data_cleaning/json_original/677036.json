I came by myself as my parents were coming back from Europe and were having a stopover in Singapore. Their travel agent assured them that this hotel was excellent, so of course I wanted to stay with them when they arrived so I booked the hotel too. Imagine my surprise when I get there (the staff were very friendly though), the hotel is old, my room was a total shock and I got told I had been upgraded. The room was wide enough to have a queen bed and a side table on each side. At the end was a cupboard with a mini fridge inside, small hanging space on the other side and on top was the tv. To the left was a table with reading lamp. Where you would normally put your suitcase was a small fold out table which when you did this was extremely cramped when entering the front door. As previously mentioned in other reports the room needs more lighting. The floor was wooden and so you could hear noise from other rooms. The bathroom was clean, although it was extremely small. I'm glad it was just me in the room and not my husband as well as it would have been extremely crowded. Unfortunately the bed is rock hard and so I woke every day with sore shoulders and neck. I asked each morning if they could put a comforter on the bottom and they said they would, but nothing eventuated, so alas 5 nights of no sleeping, and that is not what you want when you have been out all day and all you want to do is come home eventually to a comfortable bed and sleep soundly. I was also very disapointed in the breakfast each morning. I know I shouldn't have expected anything like the other hotels that I have stayed at in Singapore before, but it was extremely basic. When my parents finally arrived we asked if we could combine our two rooms into one executive suite so that we all could sleep together. They said this could not be done as we had booked two separate rooms. We tried explaining to them that they would be better off as the cost of our two rooms was going to be more expensive than a executive suite and also they would have two other rooms they could use. But they could not understand this, so unfortunately it never happened. I would recommend this hotel only for business travellers (which we noticed alot of business people), as they are just passing through and doing business.

It's a lil walk using the link to the lotus section and the corridor is a little tight. however the rooms are surprisingly spacious for a budget hotel. The room is clean and they provide basic amenities. The beds are comfortable and the comforter will keep you warm at night. Aircons, fridge and a safe are provided in all rooms. The windows are doubled layered (as so i'm told) so there's not much noise from outside. Decor is not too bad. The only downside for me was there's not enough lighting in the room and the walls could use a lil touch up. Bathroom space is small but the shower could fit 2 people in a tight squeeze ;). basic toiletries are also provided. Towels provided are clean. If you're a non muslim there are plenty of places to eat as most of the restaurant around the hotel closes at 5am. In the morning, there's a market place you could walk to and on the first floor it's where there's hawker stalls selling local economic delicacies. Located outside the main building is a convenience shop called cheers. MRT is about 8-10 mins walk. It is not far IF you're used to walking. Using MRT from Outram park to Vivo via Harbour Front station takes only 5 mins. The hotel also provide shuttle service to take hotel guest to MRT, China town and Orchard road every hour. If you are familiar with the bus system there is a bus stop a block away from the hotel. Taking a taxi from the airport is about 15-20 mins drive and it cost us about $15SGD.", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cSmall rooms and dirty bathroom\u201d", "Author": "Fonty1212", "ReviewID": "UR75721632", "Content": "A friend and I stayed at this hotel for two nights in July. I was really looking forward to it - especially after staying at some pretty average (and sometimes below average) accommodation whilst travelling in India and Vietnam prior to arriving Singapore. The hotel is about 8-10 minutes walk from the Outram MTR station. It isn't too bad if you don't mind the walking. But if you are someone who prefer to have easy access to transportation, this hotel might not be the ideal place for you to stay. The hotel is made of two buildings linked together by a connecting bridge (thus the name of the hotel). When we were shown our room, I was a bit disappointed by the size of the room. It was an extremely small room and there was hardly any space to store two pieces of standard suitcases. My friend ended up putting her luggage on the dressing table and mine on a chair. Bedsheets, pillow cases and towels were clean and in good condition. However, there really is an issue with the cleanliness of the bathroom. There was a very thick build up of black mould on silicon around the edge of the hand washbasin. There was also evidence of toothpaste (at least I hope it was toothpaste!) on the back of the bathroom door. Mould was also evident on grout in between the wall and floor tiles in the shower case indicating that it had not been cleaned adequately. I was disappointed by this as I had expected the cleanliness of any hotel in Singapore (given the country's reputation), to be more satisfactory than the hotels I stayed in developing countries....Another thing i want to add is that there is only free internet access if you are using your own laptop. If you are using a computer from their business centre, they charge you SGD15 per half an hour (if my memory serves me correctly). Anyway, onto the more positive aspect of the hotel, the hotel is situated very close to the market (about three minutes walk). A hawkers food court is situated above this market. My friend and I ended up going there for breakfast during the three days we were in Singapore. There is a huge variety of foods available and you can purchase a very satisfying meal for under SGD$3.", "Date": "August 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cNice room but no hotel facilities\u201d", "Author": "Staxi", "ReviewID": "UR73361895", "Content": "We had a very spacious room though after reading through the hotel website we were expecting more from this so-called boutique hotel.

The rooms are incredibly small though, and that's saying a lot for someone who lives in Hong Kong! That aside, the furnishing are tastefully done and the beds + sheets are clean and comfortable. I reckon we had the most basic room and it came with tea+coffee, kettle, tv, mini-fridge, safe, shampoo/conditioner, flat-screen plasma TV (with CNN and other major cable channels). Service was excellent - when I checked-in I asked the front desk for information on a particular restaurant nearby (check out Capitol Restaurant if you have the time, it's about a 15-minute walk and it serves fantastic seafood. Ask for the specialty: steamed Sultan Fish) and they printed out a 3-page internet website of the restaurant and delivered it to our room. With a smile. Nice! The only fault is that the toilet exhaust isn't strong enough to remove the humidity (Singapore is often very humid) so as a result there were many \"flies\" in the toilet. They aren't fruit-flies, but small flies that were \"stuck\" on the ceiling. They didn't bother me but it just gave the impression that the toilet wasn't very clean. After the room service on the first morning, they were gone though. Will I stay there again? Yes, absolutely.

If I were to do it again I would of booked at the Crown Plaza which is connected to Terminal 3 and saved myself a couple hours of sleep before the flight.", "Date": "June 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cok hotel. value for money given the location.\u201d", "Author": "russiabear", "ReviewID": "UR16399639", "Content": "stayed 2 nights in a superior room. comes in 4 themes, Chinese, Indian, Malay, and Modern. dont ask me which one my room was themed after, i dont know any different. value for money: price is just about right, given size of room, quality of room and location of hotel. hotel room: size is just a little small, but that's ok given that its not a room to be enjoyed but to sleep in. they have cable tv (korean, japanese, sports, news, etc) and LCD tv so that's pretty cool. toilet: no bath, just shower. however, the toilet gave out a stink smell. not very obvious if you leave the door open and aircon turned on. but if you are in the bathroom, you can smell the stink. maybe its just my room, or those that are connected to the same faulty plumbing. internet access: free! that's a plus point. and when you check in, they ask if you know how to use it, and if you have a laptop, they will offer you a LAN cable for connection. of course, you would have to return it or they will charge it to your room, haha. distance to nearest MRT station: not too good. have to walk quite a distance, as it is smack right between the 2 nearest stations. getting a taxi: not many taxi drivers know about this hotel, as its not very well known yet. even if it is probably the ONLY hotel in these parts. since a majority of drivers are chinese, if you can tell them the chinese name (which is nothing like link hotel, duh!), they can probably relate to it better. of course, showing the map of the hotel location might help a bit. nearby food and convenience kiosk: 5 stars! the famous tiong bahru food court (upgraded to a 2-storey building recently) and a few seafood restaurants are just a walk around the block. one seafood restaurant turned me off. i waited 30 min and then checked with the waitress, only to find that the food will take another 30 min. i left at that point. moral of the story: ask before you sit down how long it will take for your orders to be served. and next to the food court is a 7-11 24-hour convenience outlet. next to the 7-11 is a nice little restaurant that sells shanghainese food, like small dragon steamed buns, fried rice cakes, etc.", "Date": "May 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taipei", "Title": "\u201cA cozy stay with Link Hotel\u201d", "Author": "david988", "ReviewID": "UR15692258", "Content": "Early this year I made a short business trip to Singapore from Taipei, and found myself in a new and comfortable stay with Link Hotel.

The hotel is spotlessly clean and the rooms are well furnished and comfortable. A nice range of complimentary toiletries were supplied in the bathroom. Although the hotel emphasised the themed rooms, we were not given any options. The room was ideal for a couple of nights but would have been a bit claustrophobic for any longer. If you require an extra bed or would need a travel cot in the room be sure to check out the size of the room as we found it difficult to fit in a travel cot We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant, which although more expensive than the local eateries. was very nicely presented. The local area is interesting and about a seven minute easy walk from the MRT which is very efficient and can comfortably get you around Singapore in a short time. Overall I would say an ideal short-stay hotel for couples, looking for cleanliness and comfort but not wanting to spend too much time in their room. .", "Date": "April 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cLove the comforter\u201d", "Author": "MalayLady", "ReviewID": "UR14699956", "Content": "Arrived at Link Hotel and was greeted by a friendly bellman who helped open the taxi door and picked up my baggage. Check in was quick and easy, and i was brought to my room by the same bellman who had helped me out the taxi. He told me the Link Hotel got its name from the link bridge which linked the main hotel building with a second building across the road. My room was on the second building and it was a pretty long walk from the lobby. So I would recommend you to request a room at the main building, cuz it would be much much easier. the room was very small, i must agree. but it was clean and the furnishing are new. the bed was comfy with a nice fluffy comforter. the tv had a very limited choice of channels. the bathroom only had a shower, but it is ok for me. the basic amenities are adequate. But i did not notice any theme in my room as other reviewers. However, the bathroom a bit smelly, i suppose it is because of the old pipeworks considering the hotel is an old building. I went for business trip, so i dont get enough time to tour the area around the hotel. anyhow it is situated near chinatown so there are a lot of chinese restaurants and a Tiong Bahru Market nearby. However, through my week's stay at the hotel, i went to Tiong Bahru Plaza, a shopping mall, about 10mins walk from the hotel for dinner. Among Halal eateries available are the common fast food outlets, Mr Teh Tarik and another restaurant at the top floor. All in all, i dont mind to stay at this hotel again, as it was a nice place to stay for a person travelling alone.", "Date": "April 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cPlesant surprise\u201d", "Author": "chye82", "ReviewID": "UR13718584", "Content": "Booked a night stay at the hotel on New Year's Eve. There was a promotion going on and I got the room at SGD $180 for a night stay. Their usual prices per night will be about $220+. Located in the heartlands of Singapore, this is very unusual for a hotel. There weren\u2019t many problems during check in, front desk personnel are friendly and I got my room relatively fast. Room was a nice surprise. I got the Chinese Theme room, and I really like the d\u00e9cor of the room, especially the lights makes the room looks really romantic. Toilet is clean, though a bathtub will be nice. I am quite surprised that previous reviews about this hotel complained about the size of the room. I find the size relatively decent. Trust me; I have been to smaller rooms in Singapore before. However, I do agree that if I pay $220+ for a night, I will be expecting more. Location-wise I think the hotel is really unique. There are many food stalls just at your door step. There is the famous Tiong Bahru market, famous among Singaporeans, offering cheap and great local food fare. There is also a seafood restaurant located just across the road. The restaurant opens till late, and offer decent quality of seafood. There is also a 24 hour Hong Kong Caf\u00e9 just beside that can satisfy your dim sum cravings in the middle of the night. The hotel is not really accessible, especially for tourists that may not know their way around Singapore well. The hotel is located in between Tiong Bahru Plaze and Chinatown. For tourists, you may need to take a bus or taxi in order to travel to attractions in Singapore.

In the day, the room is full of light. At night, the warm, cosy lighting is good to fall asleep in. Maybe because I haven't been to hotel in long time but I like the fluffy blanket. Not like what we have last time, the hospital-like blankets. Just opposite the hotel is a Hong Kong Cafe. Great if you want a bite at night but don't want room service. We wanted to go clubbing but didn't know what bus to take. Asked the conceirge who told us they have shuttle service to Chinatown. Near enough and free also.

But even more disappointing is the size of the 'Superior' room. I think the management have confused 'boutique' with 'compact'. One of the features of Asian hotel rooms has been their generous size, but this was the smallest room I have stayed in in Asia, irrespective of the price. I mentioned this to the duty manager on checkout, but he was defensive and I was left with the impression that he thought my opinion was worthless. There were other irritants such as their advertised internet not being available for the whole of our one day stay ('server down' - it takes more than 24 hours to fix? In Singapore?), and no morning paper. Only a small thing, but expected at these prices. It was amusing when I mentioned these matters to the duty manager on checkout. He said yes, we have internet, to which the checkout clerk whispered out of the side of her mouth 'it's down', and then, when I mentioned about the paper, another whisper out of the side of her mouth 'on request'!. All of this is a pity really because the area where the hotel is situated has a certain calmness to it after the hurly burly of other parts of Singapore, and presents another aspect of Singapore that many tourists will enjoy.
