They look empty more than anything. The worste thing about this hote was the receptionist. On christmas day we had no idea what to do as everything appeared to be closed. We went down to the front desk to ask for advise and were suprised when we ask for reccomendations about activities, places or restraunts to recieve the answer NO. Very odd. But overall this hotel worked for us, i did notice a number of other hotels in the area though that i would probably choose over this one in the future.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Luzon, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cSMALL BOUTIQUE HOTEL .. clean rooms\u201d", "Author": "Solotraveller888", "ReviewID": "UR116930741", "Content": "around 5 blocks away from postdamer platz where you can eat shop and watch movies. rooms are very clean . its located in a quiet neighborhood ... a few restaurants near the place.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peterborough, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFab location, views and breakfast.\u201d", "Author": "hammerthief", "ReviewID": "UR96764281", "Content": "Excellent location very close to Potsdammer platz and the Sony Centre.

The hotel is in very covenient location 2 min on foot from the Potzadamer plaz. Great connection with Sban, metro and buses.It is located in a very nice and quite are with a lot of shops, cafe, restaurants, cinemas, shopping mall just a short walk around. We stayed on the rooms section and not on the appartments. Our room was big enough with all standrds comfort of 3* hotel.Room size was bigger than average room size compare to other hotel in Germany. It would have been better if there will be more variety of cakes and pastries. However what they offer is more that suffucuent for good start of your day. Although we went during winter with temperaature -15-20celcius the rooms was always warm as the central heating was always on.

I stayed in Apartment room on 11th floor for 3 weeks. The apartment was really big for a single person with living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom with W/C and small store room. Living room had a big window with curtains. The scenery from it was really beautiful. Living room had TV with most German channels and few English channels, sofa, T-poy, small cupboard, small dining table with 2 chairs, ironing board with iron. Kitchen was small but well equipped with 4 burner stove, small refrigerator, microwave oven, dish washer, toaster, tea/coffee maker. It had all required utensils like cooking pans, small & big sized plates, bowls, glasses, spoons, wine glasses, serving bowls, serving spoons, scissor, knives. Bedroom was medium sized. The wooden cupboard occupied one entire wall. The cupboard had hangers to hang clothes and mirror. There was a small packet of needle and threads kept in the cupboard. The double bed was very cozy. It had 2 side tables with drawers, out of which one had a lamp. The room had a big window with curtains similar to the one in living room. The bathroom was big with bath tub, shower cabin, W/C, washbasin and dustbin. There were also 4 towels, soap, hair gel kept. The shower cabin and washbasin had hot and cold water. The store room had the front door washing machine. The passage had a big clothes stand for drying clothes. It also had an umbrella. The Wi-Fi internet was complimentary. I never faced any major connection problems except for once or twice. The room cleaning was done every alternate day. I had opted for daily breakfast which cost me 5 Euros per day. It had lot of options to choose from. Since I am a vegetarian, I had to choose from fresh fruits, boiled and scrambled eggs, cakes, 3-4 types of bread with 3-4 types of jam, butter, 2 juices, tea, coffee machine, milk, corn flakes, muesli, etc. The breakfast room was spacious and the staff was very helpful. The reception had some complimentary things like toffees, railway map, etc. The receptionists came in shift. I found all of them very polite and helpful. They knew English. The hotel had 2 lifts, out of which one was quite slow. People had to wait for lift for long in the mornings as all of them wanted to go to first floor for breakfast or for work. The nearest railway station, Potsdamer Platz, is at walking distance of 2-3min. There are lot of bakeries and restaurants nearby. The remains of Berlin Wall are at a walking distance of 5min. Lot of sightseeing places like Brandenburger Tor, Berliner Dom, Tier Garten, Memorial of killed Jews, Jewish Museum are at a walking distance of 15-20min. Potsdamer Platz also has a shopping mall.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, why so low on the ratings????\u201d", "Author": "ceseria", "ReviewID": "UR62156658", "Content": "This is a great hotel right in the middle of berlin, 2 minutes down the road from Potsdammerplatz.
