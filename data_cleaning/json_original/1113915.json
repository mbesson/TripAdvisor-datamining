Alas we were very disappointed from the minute we walked through the door. We appreciate that hotels have a check-in time however through-out our trip to Japan most hotels tried to accomodate us if we arrived a couple of hours early. The Villa Fontaine said that we could only check in early if we paid an additional hourly rate. When we said that we wouldn't do this but asked if there was a place (toilets!) where we could change, the room miraculously became available and the excess fee waived. The room was small. Ours was on the second floor so could easily be seen into from the outside however the only way of having some privacy was to use a black-out blind so no natural daylight could come in at all. For a smart, modern boutique hotel it was also very disappointing to discover that there was no guest internet service available. This hotel really did seem to be a building with bedrooms and absolutely nothing else. Yes, it is in a vibrant area of Tokyo but taxi drivers struggled to find it so the location became more of a frustration than a plus point.", "Date": "Oct 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR545850576", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "ALEXAJ"}, {"Content": "Stylish Hotel in the heart of Shinjuku The Hotel Villa Fontaine chain's latest addition is the stylish Shinjuku hotel. Located right in the middle of Kabuki-cho, Japan's entertainment capital, it may not suit those looking for a traditional Japan experience.However if you want to be located close to some great bars and restaurants than look no further. The hotel opened in June 2008, and the rooms, while small, are stylishly appointed. All rooms have flat screen TVs, and a light breakfast is included in the price.Reception staff speak some English, and there are English maps of the surrounding area at reception.", "Date": "Jul 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR856477696", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "jarokun"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066457-d1113915-r21455362-Hotel_Villa_Fontaine_Shinjuku-Shinjuku_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1113915", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
