We bad experience with this hotel from the start. Regarding the other good reviews, don't believe all. I saw the staff on their laptop there writing reviews for the hotel in their free time. Our own experience, there is NO HEAT in the bathroom. We stayed in February. It was very cold use the toilet or shower! The breakfast is terrible. Most foods are sweet like cakes that have been there for days. If im going to pay high price, please give me some real hot food. Orange juice is charged separately (they dont tell you it's extra when they ask u if u want OJ, they just hand u the bill to sign with the oj. This is not fair.) The staff were very annoying when we ate breakfast because they all just stood there looking at what foods you pick, how much food u take and how you eat. Very annoying. We took a deluxe room and there is no frig or coffee maker in room. if u dont have kitchen, then at least they should have a small coffee maker. The cleaning staff dont know english, turkish or how to read basic signs. We put a Privacy sign on door and the cleaning lady just walked in on us! The local people that live across the street from hotel are nosy and intrusive to ur privacy. we had our curtains open and they kept peeking thru their windows seeing what we do. I'm never, never, never going to stay in this hotel! i wanted to leave early but we already paid for the rooms. They call this Best Point Hotel. It should rather be called Worst Point Hotel to better describe their crummy joint. There are other nicer hotels in this old historic area that are better and cost less.

It`s only a few steps away from the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and Topkapi Palace so it is a great starting point for all the sightseeing in Sultanahmet. It is also very close to the tram station if you want to visit the Asian side of Istanbul such as the Galata Tower and Taksim Square. As frequent travelers, I have to say that Best Point is the best hotel we have stayed at and the experience my wife and I had there really makes us want to visit Istanbul again very soon.

We would recommend the restaurant Amedros in Sultanhamet delicious food especially the sultans dish prepared in a clay pot with lamb.

Best Point met all of these requirements and more. The Rooms: Our group consisted of 2 adults and 2 kids (3,5yrs). We stayed in both the Triple Deluxe and the Triple Standard at different times during our stay. The rooms were beautifully arranged and suited us nicely. Some reviewers previously complained about the size of the rooms, but with 4 people in the Standard Triple, we felt we had plenty of room. We were out all day long, so we only came here to sleep. Bed wasn't the most plush thing in the world, but I didn't care. The wi-fi was awesome! Every floor has it's own router, even the rooftop, so you always have a wonderful connection to stay in touch. Location: I feel like this hotel is a hidden gem. With all of the choices you have in Istanbul, this hotel looks brand new, is down the street from the Blue Mosque and Arasta Bazaar. Some of the most highest rated restaurants listed on Trip Advisor are within a block or so of Best Point Hotel- we ate at Metropolis and Albura Kathisma. The metro stop is only about a 5-10 minute walk in front of the Pudding Shop area (for goodness sake don't eat at the Pudding Shop, though- it's awful) Ratings: We scoured Trip Advisor and all of the \"other\" travel websites looking for the perfect place and Best Point rates very well. Service: One thing that really stands out is that they actually have the staff's pictures on the website. Almost every review gets a response from the Manager, Fatih. This tells me that they are really taking your stay seriously. They are concerned about your happiness and they are taking accountability for it. Breakfast: I love to eat and another thing that makes me happy is variety in my food choices. I loved the breakfast here. So much variety. If you get there mid way through breakfast, there will be traditionally cooked dishes waiting for you at the buffet. They offer an omelette bar! You can have your eggs cooked to order, not just an omelette. I finally figured out that and started ordering my eggs sunnyside up- yum. So many cheeses, mezes, oatmeal toppings and pastries. Staff: The staff was amazing. They were welcoming, friendly and helpful. We fell in love with almost all of them. Gokhan, Fatih (even better looking in person- so handsome), Fatih #2, Kismet (breakfast service), Hussein (our driver), I apologize for not remembering everyone's names- they were all charming and helpful.

There are NO SMOKING signs all over the hotel ... it must have been due to the ventilation system of the building, even during most of the night it was almost as if somebody was in our room smoking. The breakfast has a lot of variety, but they put things out day after day to the point that there were always some stale items. And when we got down to the breakfast room a bit after 10, although the food was all still laid out, we were told quite rudely that we could not have any. The staff need to be trained not to stare and glower at guests. On the third and fourth floors, on the street side you get a view of the Blue Mosque, but also street noise and the loud call to prayer. As mentioned by other reviewers, the rooms and bathroom are small, but not tiny. There is no place but the floor to put down a suitcase -- the safe takes up room in the wardrobe to prevent being able to set down a suitcase in there. As mentioned they only changed towels and linens every other day. If our room hadn't stank of tobacco and the breakfast had been fresher, we'd have been satisfied for our $120 a night. Best Point seemed perhaps overpriced, but to be fair, we did not look at the other hotels in the area to get a fair comparison. The good things: Excellent location for the big tourist sights - a very short walk to Blue Mosque, Topkapi, Hagia Sophia, several museums, and plenty of shopping and restaurants. This is a mixed blessing, however. We felt like we were living in a tourist trap. In this part of Istanbul, f you acknowledge in any way people's greetings, they don't let up. It's annoying to have to be rude and ignore everyone, but EVERYBODY in this neighborhood is touting their shop, or guide service, or something and it really gets old fast. It's not like that in the rest of the city, so the location is great for a very quick sightseeing visit, but definitely wrong for a longer stay. Umit at the front desk staff was nice, no pressure, and very helpful when a taxi driver was ripping us off -- I asked what the fare should have been, and he helped me pay only that and get the driver to go away without any troubles. (Beware - the meter was on, but the driver somehow pulled a fast one) Free wifi was reliable with my own laptop. Free CPU terminal in lobby looked like it was busy most of the time, but still a nice thing that they offer it. There is a roof top terrace we discovered by mistake when we overshot our room going up stairs, where you can sit and enjoy views of the Blue Mosque to one side and the Bosporus to the other side.

I wished some previous reviews had taken some time to describe the hotel and surroundings a bit more so we could have a better sense of things and that will be my attempt here. My wife and I arrived early evening on a Friday after a red-eye flight from Washington, DC to Frankfurt and then a slightly delayed flight to Istanbul. Our driver was waiting for us outside of baggage claim with a placard containing our name, just as the hotel promised. This decreased a lot of anxiety on whether they would be there or not. It was about 20-25 minutes to the hotel with light traffic. The hotel is located on what I would describe as the backside of the hill where the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia are located. All the roads in the neighborhood are cobblestoned and narrow. Check-in was great with an offer to relax in the parlor with a complimentary glass of wine. Soon we were joined by a member of the staff who highlighted some sites on a map and made some suggestions on where to go when. There was no pressure to go on tours as some others have mentioned. We were dog tired and wanted to get to our room. We were a bit disappointed as we explicitly reserved a deluxe room with a Jacuzzi, but got one with a Turkish bath instead. I was thinking it was an inferior room, but apparently they are both the same price. They moved us to one the next day, so all worked out, as my wife used the Jacuzzi a couple of times. The flat screen TV is very tiny so just be prepared. It did have nearly 400 channels, but only three are in English (1, 2, 4). The other disappointing feature, but perhaps the norm here is the lack of an alarm clock. There is no way to check the time unless you have a watch. Furthermore, it would have been great to listen to the various radio stations and Turkish music. Oh, you will find the beds VERY firm (translate: hard). Pillows are very thin and they only give you a duvet, no sheet or blanket. I think these issues may be a Euro thing. They do give you two pillows, so you can double them up slightly. Breakfast was in the basement with a big buffet. It is a great spread and too much than anybody would need. Many of the offerings are what we would have for an afternoon snack (olives, cheeses, olive spreads, meats, etc.), but it was fun. The meats looked old and were drying up, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t touch them. Omelets are made to order, but were a bit too greasy for me. Orange juice is extra (2 euros, I believe). But they have cookies, hazelnut spreads, dried apricots, yogurt, raisins, etc. The main building with lobby is about 4 stories with a roof-top terrace. This has a great view of the Blue Mosque with several bean bag chairs to lounge in. There are many tables, presumably used for eating in the warmer months. As you head into the back, you cross through a small parlor, out into a tiny courtyard and into another building. It looks as if this was another building located on the back street that may have purchased, torn down and built into a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153matching\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd part of the original hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s style. This is where our room was located with a view out over a narrow street. This too, has a roof-top terrace, but a bit lower than the other one. As you exit the hotel, you will see that it is pretty trashy directly ahead. A dumpster with a lot of trash spilling around, alas, welcome to Turkey. Plus, you will see many stray cats as you will around the rest of Istanbul. If you take a right up the narrow street, you go a short distance to a main intersection. All along there are other boutique hotels, restaurants, cafes, and some shops. If you go straight 2-3 blocks, you come right to the Four Seasons. If you take a left up the hill, you start heading in the direction of the Mosque. However, if you keep heading straight off this road, you enter a courtyard with many outdoor seats and tables. You will find a very large bazaar heading left at this point with many, many shops that seem relatively quiet of tourists and no sales pressure. If you exit the hotel and take a left down the hill, it seems a bit shady, as we started to go this way at night. We discovered later that it is plenty safe. You go under the train tracks and this opens up to a street on the left with 2-3 restaurants. We ate at the first one on the left (on the corner) as somebody rated it good on a Web review. We would agree. By the way, it is important to note that two buildings down to the left of the hotel is a small convenient store. We regularly bought some bottles of beer here (Efes) and some chips to munch on. Very inexpensive alternative to sitting in a bar. By the way, heads up on walking around these local streets (and elsewhere). Sidewalks are narrow, if they exist at all, and often taken up with cafes, shop displays, etc. This forces you into the street, but drivers here are aggressive and yield little to pedestrians. You will find cars routinely going the wrong way on one-way streets and often motorcycles and scooters driving on the sidewalks. We also found the prayer calls at 6:30 am (heard at any hotel anywhere) very mystical and alluring. We actually looked forward to hearing them before going back to sleep. Everywhere around the hotel I would consider very safe. Just start walking around and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be afraid if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look like much, there is always a gem around the bend. We were gone literally all day, leaving at 9 am and returning at 5 pm most every day so we spent little time here. I hope this helps more with the physical description of the place and neighborhood.

It was also the hottest time of the year with temperatures in the 40s and high humidity, so I was a bit nervous about how it would go.A good start was that the hotel sent a minibus free of charge to meet us at the airport. When we arrived at the hotel we were delighted to find that it was situated in the heart of the old part of the city, a stone's throw away from the Blue Mosque. We were greeted as we stepped out of the minibus by the owner/manager and from that moment on he was around 24 /7 to meet our needs.He sat us down in the courtyard, gave us free cold drinks, and laid on some light refreshments After seeing our rooms , which were all of a standard higher than I had expected in a small hotel (minibar, slippers, jacuzzi, hamam and very effective aircon) he talked us through the services the hotel could offer and made suggestions as to what we might want to do and see given we were only staying for 3 nights. We signed up for quite an expensive day tour which he suggested because it didn't include the things we could walk to, but took us to some of the key sights further afield in the city which we wouldn't have been able to reach without a car. It proved to be an excellent choice, with something for everyone including a 2 hour boat trip on the Bosporous which, along with hopping in and out of the airconditioned coach between sights, kept us reasonably cool on a sweltering day which would have defeated us if we had been out and about on our own on foot. In the evening the hotel offered a free chauffer driven service to and from a range of restaurants in the city. I was a bit suspicious at first thinking that perhaps they would be overpriced , but the only tiime we got ripped off was the one night when we didn't use this service and struck out on our own.The breakfast at the hotel had a wide range of dishes so there was something for everyone and could have been taken on the roof terrace, but we didn't do that as the steps were too narrow and steep for my husband. However he did manage to climb up there one day for a sandwich lunch and the views were great. All the staff in the hotel were fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble, ranging from offering to go to the chemist for my husband when he discovered he had forgotten his insulin needles and laying on a driver to take us round on our last day to places we still wanted to see but couldn't walk to. By the last day it felt as if we had all known each other for years and the hotel was like a home from home. All of this came at a very reasonable price. We had the best and most expensive rooms in the hotel which worked out at about \u00c2\u00a338 per head per night , including breakfast. We all agreed that it was the hotel and the service they gave us that had turned a potentially hot and stressful 4 day sightseeing trip into a relaxing and enjoyable experience for us all, especially our grandchildren who had had doubts about Istanbul as part of their summer holiday,but left with great memories and thoroughly enjoyed one of their first hotel experiences..", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay, wonderful location, rooms, and good value\u201d", "Author": "ckdexterhaven11", "ReviewID": "UR78384155", "Content": "Best point has a fantastic location, a helpful staff, and very comfortable and attractive rooms.

In fact, this was something that really made an impression on us. Fatih and his staff bent over backwards to help us at all times, even offering us a warm drink when we were caught in a downpour and came in soaked.

We were too busy visiting the sites to use the jacuzzi but it's there for anyone who wants it! Breakfast at the hotel is also a great experience, absolutely delicious. Fatih also recommended dining at Fener and Kalamar in the fish market. Both proved to be the best dining experiences of our stay and the atmosphere in the market area is not only fun, but unique. Free transportation to and from the restaurants was organized by reception. The Best Point provides great value for money but its biggest asset is the friendly service and great advice provided by Fatih and his staff.

Our room was not large, but was perfectly formed, with a huge bed and all the furniture you would expect in a hotel room. We had booked the Economy Double (which is located beside reception) but because we were staying for 9 nights we had been given a free upgrade where we had access to a private mini courtyard, with table and chairs for two: Perfect! There was efficient air conditioning and the bathroom shower was the best we had ever come across in any hotel, anywhere! Spacious, with a power shower with real blasting power, which could be set to any temperature you wished it to be. Best Breakfast: A huge range of options, including cheeses, meats, biscuits and cakes and almost any spread you could think of (including honeycomb honey!) for your fresh bread and rolls, or adding to your cereal, or yoghurt. Freshly made Omlettes were a choice, with a variety of filler options. The lovely lady who supervises the kitchen takes an obvious pride in ensuring that the everything looks and tastes good. A touch I was especially grateful for (and almost impossible to get anywhere else in Istanbul) was a decent mug size cup for the coffee, with a pot of hot milk to add to taste, Early morning Bliss! There was also a variety of teas to choose from. If you wished you could choose your breakfast and have it taken up to the delightful roof terrace by a very fit staff as it's four flights up! However, the view is the Best, with the Blue Mosque on one side and sea views on the other three. You can also spot other roof terraces, who are sharing the same view, but which cost at least twice and often three times as much as the Best Point.

The room was large \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it had a king size bed, a small sofa, a table and chairs, lots of closet space and drawers and we still had a lot of room to move around.

The location of the hotel is very central \u00e2\u20ac\u201c literally, a few minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk to the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia. Because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the heart of Sultahnamet area, restaurants and shops abound. Although they have a lot of variety for breakfast, we preferred having an omelet freshly prepared upon request (at no additional cost). The hotel provided free internet and the wireless connection in the room was very strong, which was an added bonus. The staff are very attentive to our needs and accommodating. After a long day of sightseeing, they will always offer you a complimentary drink (tea, water, etc.) if you linger in the lobby. They can appear to be over eager at times, providing suggestions for what to see in Istanbul. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not pushy though so you can choose to follow their suggestions or not.

As we were staying for 4 nights we had the benefit of included transfers to & from Ataturk Airport, which was helpful in a city we had not visited before. Our reception by Fatih Yildirim was attentive & helpful, being welcomed with a drink & information. We subsequently found all the other staff to be equally pleasant & obliging. We had the Blue Mosque suite on the 4th floor which was excellent, with a great view of the mosque & a good size terrace. Only a few more stairs took us to the roof terrace with excellent views across the city & the Sea of Marmara. The hotel was very clean & well appointed, situated in a quiet part of Akbiyik Street, very close to many restaurants to choose from for dinner. There was an excellent choice for the buffet breakfast including omelettes made to order, on top of as a large choice of meats & cheese, etc. In short, we have no hesitation in recommending the hotel for its location, staff & quality of accommodation. Only a little further afield was Sultanahmet Square, with several of Istanbul's major sights, a bank of ATMs, more restaurants & a tram stop (70p anywhere, though city coverage is a bit limited). The Topkapi Palace complex was an easy walk away as well. All the major sights were worth seeing, surprisingly apart from the Grand Bazaar, the highlight probably being a half-day boat trip up the Bosphorus, booked through the hotel. Other favourites were the Hagia Sophia, the Egyptian (Spice) Bazaar near Galata Bridge & the Topkapi. On a general note, it is worth checking anywhere in Istanbul not only the cost of anything in numbers, but also the currency symbol, as Turkish Lira, Euros & Dollars all seem to be acceptable. If you assume something is priced in Lira, & it turns out to be in Euros, this effectively doubles the cost! If there was a downside, as the hotel does not have a lift, it would be an inappropriate choice for those with mobility difficulties unless you book a ground floor room.

Based on the reviews and the constant communication with Fatih (the owner) who was prompt in answering my emails and providing me with all the explanations I ended choosing best point hotel. Since the minute I stepped in I knew I made the right decision, the checking in was fast with no complications or surprises, they rapidly took me to my room taking into consideration that we were very tired after a long trip. the rooms are nicely decorated in neutral relaxing colors, spotless and with a beautiful view to the blue mosque. Most of all , from someone who suffers of chronic pain back, what I enjoyed the most was the mattress, surprisingly during all my stay I did not feel the pain. I can only thank Fatih for not ignoring the comfort part. the location was the best near to all main sites. The view of the blue mosque and marmara see from the terrace was breathtaking. The breakfast was beyond expectations! from freshly baked cookies and cakes to numerous jellies to various flavors of tea , omelets, olives tomatoes,cheeses, fruits ect... you can never deny the high quality of the breakfast in this hotel. The service was impeccable their hospitality was overwhelming everyone made us feel at home. Everything I wrote so far was for the readers who like to choose a hotel based on the reviews just like i did. Now I am going to talk about the friends I made at best point. Friends who helped me to fully enjoy this beautiful city, they gave me tips on how to get around, always willing to direct me to the best places.

Our flight has arrived Istanbul 8:30 in the morning and after we got to the hotel, Mr. Fatih has welcomed us, offered us a drink and a breakfast which we've done at the top floor terrace, the view from the hotel terrace is Amazing ( Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia and the sea from two sides), this was very refreshing, after we have finished our breakfast we received our room which was a great gesture from the hotel. the room was very clean and well decorated, it is the same size as the room we got in Paris last year so it's size is normal in old city of Istanbul. After we have rested in the room we asked Mr. Fatih advice for touring in Istanbul, and he helped us to organize our four and half days stay, I must say that his advices were very helpful, for example he advised us not to buy from the Grand bazaar because the prices are too high and instead buy from Istiklal street (Takseem Square), and after we bought from the Grand bazaar we realized that he was correct. I must mention here the great location of the hotel, it is very close to all important historical sights in Istanbul such as the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia and Topkapi palace, all were a walking distance from the hotel in addition to Sultanahmet Tram station which is near Aya Sofia. This is very convenient because even if you don't know where to go or if you just want to hang out, you can walk to the park near Aya Sofia and the Blue mosque and enjoy the fountain and all people from all of the world going there. Istanbul is a very beautiful city, people are very polite and helpful (although their English is not perfect), also the city is very clean, it's topography is very convenient, the sea is everywhere and the city hills are full of historical mosques that you can see from everywhere. If you like just to walk and blend with locals you must go to Taksim square, Ortakoy (to eat Kumpere) and if you want to enjoy the Bosphore in addition to silence walk you can go to Bebek and walk besides the see, enjoy a cup of tea and the beautiful houses in this rich neighbourhood.

The staff is friendly -- that is clear. But maybe too friendly. After 20+ hours of travel, the hotel staff insisted on sitting us down in the lobby to tell us what we should do and where we should go during our visit. Instead, we just wanted to go to our room to decompress. This continued througout the entire stay, with the staff breathing down our necks the entire time. If you like privacy, this is not the place for you. You can't even pick up a piece of toast without someone rushing over to hold your plate for you. The rooms were tastefully decorated, yes. But they were very small, and our double bed was only two singles pushed together. You'd imagine that you'd get a real double bed for these prices and not wake up stuck in a hole. Also, our door had quite a large crack in it, and you could even stand in the hallway and look right into our bedroom and at the bed directly! Another thing of note is that the hotel is four stories high (five to get to the rooftop) and there is no elevator. If you are in any unable to climb flights upon flights of stairs, this is not the hotel for you. Last thing I wanted to note is that the lobby computer has the trip advisor site as their homepage.

Sat with us to plan our 4 1/2 day stay. Aranged a personal tour of places outside the immediate walking area. And since we arrived during the noon time, a fruit plate was brought up which we enjoyed on our balcony. I read in other review that the room was small but we had enough space for everything including putting our suitcases in the closet. We had been to a business conference so we had a lot of clothing but everything fit. I highly recommend Room 403 as it does have a nice balcony. But keep in mind that there are stairs...if you have difficulty with stairs, then they have rooms on the lower levels. There is a restaurant row to the right of the hotel where we ate most evenings. The first night Fatih arranged for the Kalamar Fish restaurant to pick us up and return us to the hotel...Then the rest of the time, we ate at the Aria on their roof, The Metropolis, and at Ocean's 7. All were good. We were steps away from the Blue Mosque.... There is a Turkish bath in the room which felt wonderful after a day of touring. Everyone in Istanbul was very inviting and friendly. If you choose to go, Best Point is where you should stay. Great location.

The only one drawback to this hotel is that if you are wishing for a livelier evening and nightlife, you have to head out to the new part of Istanbul to Beyoglu. Sometimes we taxi'd it and sometimes we took the tram. But this isnt the hotel's fault. It was my choice to stay in Sultanahmet.", "Date": "March 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cCozy, central and friendly\u201d", "Author": "Torunn65", "ReviewID": "UR27041149", "Content": "Our stay in Best Point hotel was a pleasure from we arrived until we left. The hotel staff (Emrah and his collegues) was friendly and helpful, and included us as part of \"the family\". The rooms were clean, and nicely decorated, the breakfast was good, and the terrace was perfect for champagne drinking (or take your coffee there in the mornings) and just enjoying the view of the Blue mosk\u00c3\u00a8 and the Marmara sea. Istanbul is a very interesting city, the Turkish people very friendly and helpful, and a visit to the hamam (turkish bath) is a must. We recomend you find a local one instead of the ones mentioned in the guide books. The carpet sellers are very persistent. If you don't want to look in their shops you have to be very clear about that, unless you want them following you around. Enjoy a visit to one of the restaurants outside the spice bazar, or just stroll around in the city at you leasure.

The location is just perfect for that and literally only five minutes walk from the Blue Mosque. It is very clean and everything described on the website was there although the rooms were slightly small, but hey we only slept there. Every morning, the staff, always charming, smiling & helpful set up a great buffet breakfast to start our day. Although the only hot item available was freshly made to order omelette, that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us as there was always a good variety of cold meats, cheeses, cereal, pastries and fruit to eat. In warmer weather you can breakfast on the roof terrace which has views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorus, (great for night shots!).There are plenty of restaurants within 100-200 metres, within all price points, that serve a variety of food comparable and surpassing that of restaurants in the middle of Istanbul.

Some minutes after, somebody knocked at the door bringing some freshly squeezed oranges for us... A real treat ! The best thing about the hotel is Jay... ( I hope I have spelt your name right...) !

We found all the staff really friendly and helpful and the rooms were spotless and tastefully decorated. We were three adults sharing a room, so it was a little cramped, but this certainly did not spoil our stay. The breakfast was a wide buffet selection of cheeses, cold meats, fresh fruit and vegetables as well as fresh bread and cakes, perfect for setting you on your way for a days sightseeing. The hotel has a lovely roof terrace, with great views down to the Bosphorus and of the Grand Mosque in the other direction. The hotel has no lift and the stairs are steep, so would not be suitable for elderly or disabled travellers, however Istanbul as a city is hilly and cobbled!
