{"Reviews": [{"Content": "best location I stay in this hotel every time i go to Hong Kong. Service is great and the rooms are very comfortable. You get complimentary water too but you have to pay a steep price for internet. Its connected to Ocean Terminal which is a huge shopping area that connects the other Marco Polo hotels. It's a 3 minute walk towards the MTR on Nathan road. Since it is near the Harbor, its a 10minute walk to get there and you can ride the ferry towards Hong Kong Island (it's the more scenic route).", "Date": "Dec 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR204410632", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "maha86"}, {"Content": "Excellent Service, best location There are three Macro Polo Hotels in Canton Road. I stayed in Macro Polo Prince before. I preferred Macro Polo Gateway. Gateway is located in the middle and it has the best location. It is only within 5-minutes walking distance to the Tsim Sha Tsui MTR (subway) station. It is next to the upscale shopping center \u9225?Harbor City.  Hotel\u9225\u6a9a staff was excellent. Service was good. I was sick and I called the hotel desk for help. The hotel staff was so kind and he walked me to a nearby doctor.The hotel room was kind of outdated, and you would have \u9225\u6e1eeal key\u9225?instead of access card. Closet in the room was not functioning at all. I could not even open it. I would say that the room was quite small and it would need renovation. However, it was clean.", "Date": "Nov 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR480254893", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "UptownXriver"}, {"Content": "\u7ed4\u5b2a\u6e74\u9287\ue21b\u6e36\u6942\u6a48\u7d12   showReview(23239056, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 4, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR165825006", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mami12"}, {"Content": "\u9288\u5e7f\u506a\u9289\u51a6\u5120\u9287\u5c7b\u501b\u9287\u5b28\u4eef\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(23179705, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 2, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR963283028", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "azu78"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d1161242-r22723962-Gateway_Hong_Kong-Hong_Kong_Hong_Kong_Region.html", "HotelID": "1161242", "Price": "\" id=\"hotel_1161242\">"}}
