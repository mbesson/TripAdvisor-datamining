Everyone in the hotel is very nice, always friendly and helpful regardless of who you are dealing with. They accomodated our request for early check in even though the hotel was full. Our package included access to the \"club\" which is really great. The host in the club was very helpful! We went there for a sort of Happy hour at 5:30 and they had out a nice display of hors d'oeuvres and many choices of wine and other drinks (no charge!). There was smoked salmon, pasta, cheese, veggies, etc, a very nice assortment We could have just stayed there and eaten enough for our dinner! But we went to Osco for dinner. Dinner at Osco was very good, a nice restaurant, Our server seemed distracted and forgot about us for most of the evening, but we sensed this was more of a one time thing. We still enjoyed dinner. Prices were reasonable and our package included a $25 discount. When we got back to our room, they had come by and left a little package with mini-cupcakes, a bottle of water and a personalized note.

We decided to plan our trip around a concert, birthday and anniversary. I love investigating hotels and spent some time searching the hotel websites looking for good deals back in January. I came across the Intercontinental Montreal and we booked the Deluxe Irresistible Room. Apon arrival at the hotel, we were treated to the attractive reception area and check-in. The front desk was polite and there was no wait. Once we had received our room keys, we ascended to the 23rd floor to our room. Upon entree I realized we were given a room with two double beds rather then one king. I called reception and they said they had two other rooms with kings but they were on the 10th and 14th floors and had less attractive views but if we would like, we could move. The view from our room on the 23rd floor was wonderful, overlooking the St. Laurence river, facing l'il bizarre and the port. We decided to stay. The room was spotless with a contemporary decor, a large flat screen tv, mini bar, desk, chair, iPod dock, regular hotel literature, two pillow top double beds and a comfy chair with foot rest. The bathroom was a comfortable size with triangular shower, separate bath, toilet and deep sink. Basic toiletries were provided. The first night when my fianc\u00c3\u00a9e attended a concert with friends, I spoke to the front desk if they could assist me in organizing some spa activities. In a matter of minutes, the front desk had arranged an appointment at an Old Montreal salon followed by a massage with one of the hotel's RMTs. While my fianc\u00c3\u00a9e attended a concert, I was pampered at the salon and received a skilled deep tissue massage by one of the hotel's RMTs in their health spa. At this point you could go for a swim in the pool, but I was too relaxed and returned to my room. Following my appointments, I ordered room service which was from Osco's, the hotel's restaurant. I called using the direct line. They answered immediately addressing me using my name (nice touch). Nothing ever seemed like a bother for the staff. They are all so authentically pleasant, it really made me feel special - as if I was the only guest there. The room service was delivered within 20 minutes with a lovely additional touch - miniature cupcakes from the chef. So cute and yummy too! The remaining nights we visited the Sarah B. Bar and ordered room service once more from Osco's. Sara B. Bar's specialty is Absinthe. We each tried it for the first time and enjoyed as the bartender introduced us to its process of dripping cold water over a sugar cube from a beautiful art nouveau styled water fountain. Overall I absolutely love this hotel and feel I was truly treated to an exceptional experience. The hotel is so quite for sleeping, beautifully decorated, the staff are top-notch. Each day the room was straightened by housekeeping making it a wonderful retreat from our daily and nightly adventures. The location of the hotel is fantastic as well. You have an assortment of mid-priced to fine dining restaurants in close proximity. The historic streets of old Montreal, the awe inspiring cathedral of Notre Dame and the port are all only short walks away. In each direction you turn, you will be presented with the old world architecture of the city, juxtaposed with contemporary buildings - the area is a real treat for the senses. Would I stay at the Intercontinental Montreal again. Bien sur! In a heart beat!

At this price, we cannot complain a lot. The location is great, just between Old Montreal and Downtown. WINTER TIP : It is connected to the underground city, so you can get all over downtown without going outside. Just go down and grab a map, you can get to your destination without having your ears fall off, even on the coldest day! The rooms leave something to be desired for decor, they seem dated with burgundy reds. The bed is comfortable enough to sleep on, the \"view\" of the deluxe room is nothing special, you can see the port if you look way to the side...other than that you are facing another high rise unless you get very high in the building. The bathroom seems the most dated of all, the bathtub is not deep enough for a relaxing soak, and the shower is small and feels crammed. On the 2nd night, we found out in the morning that our shower drain was virtually blocked so we couldn't take a shower. I mentioned it on checkout and the clerk just said \"OK\" without apologizing or recognizing that it was an actual problem. I had to mention it again to ensure she actually noted it for the maintenance people at the very least. The concierge was very nice, we appreciated her assistance.She didn't seem to know the area as well as one would expect, but she did put in a great effort to help us find places we were specifically looking for. If this hotel were not connected to the underground city, and if I had paid more than $100 I would certainly be removing a star here. Those two things will allow me to give a 4 star rating.

Our room was a decent size, comfortable and clean. It is not overly luxurious but still very nice. The bed was a little uncomfortable which was the only downside to the bed. On our second night, we discovered that we were missing a coffee maker in the room. So I called and they said they would send someone up - it was about 11:00 at night, and the gentleman that came with the coffee maker said he had to install it, he couldn't just leave it with us. So then there was some guy in our room for about 10 minutes putting in the coffee maker which I thought was a little odd and unfortunate that they didn't check the room first. Wireless internet costs an extra $15 per night. When you book the room, I would ask for the i-connect package. You can't get it at check in, but if you get it ahead of time, it is $11 a night for wireless internet plus unlimited phone calls - a much better deal. We went to the restaurant downstairs for buffet breakfast. Definitely NOT worth it. It was a weekday (not sure if it is better on weekends), but it was $23 per person and the food was not very good, and I would have thought there would be more variety for $23.

His knowledge of the city was excellent and his great suggestions were greatly appreciated by my wife and I. There were a few downsides about this hotel the first being that the internet isn't free, it's $15 a day. They offer wifi in the lounge but for a five star hotel you would assume that wifi should be free in the comfort of your room. The rooms were very comfortable, large and well decorated. The bathrooms are nice and very large, our shower was a bit weathered, noticeable amounts of mold in between the grout lines, also some dried up caulking that was breaking apart from the side marble pieces. Our bathroom could have used a bit of updating to meet other five star hotels we've stayed at in the past. The continental breakfast had plenty of variety and the food was great. Another down side was the parking, we ended up parking at the garage under the hotel which is very expensive $23 a day. The hotel is walking distance to Old Montreal and the great restaurants.

Great location. Literally a 5 minute walk from Old Montreal and the Port. The hotel was situated ontop of the underground \"city\" so you don't have to walk outside, which is much needed during Montreal winters. Connected to the metro as well which was nice. Room: We stayed in the 1King Intimate Standard. Bed was extremely comfortable, tv flat screen, iPod dock/radio, washroom was big enough, pretty standard, and the stand in shower and separate tub is always nice! Toiletries were amazing and replenished. Towels clean and plentiful. *Ask for a room with a nice view when reserving. Some rooms look out to a brick wall. We had a great view of Mount-Royal and the downtown core. Sarah B Absinthe Bar- in the lobby was busy on Friday night from 5-7pm. Absinthe served with proper water spouts and was tasty. ($15/drink) Rest of the drinks ranged from $9-20ish. Cons: We did not touch the mini bar in our room and upon check out were charged for a drink (make sure they know you did not take anything as it is all \"automated\") Also, they charged us for Dry Cleaning and Laundry and did not say anything. After handing me the receipts I noticed and asked about the charge. Apparently they had charged us instead of the guest from the previous stay. Were not very apologetic. Just double check your totals upon check out. Also, our side mirror in our room was broken and the end bench at the foot of the bed was dirty with coffee (obviously they did not clean it) However the mirror was fixed right away which was nice! Parking- $65 for the 2 nights to park 9levels down and must take 2 elevators and cross the parking lot just to get to the lobby is a bit ridiculous.

All L'Occitane, all amazing. The service at this hotel was very good. Our room keys stopped working a couple of times, but they were quick to fix them. Also, watch out if you are checking out late. A housekeeper came into our room in the morning, which was a little unsettling. We had forgot to call for a late checkout... The bed was very comfortable, I slept better than at home. The pool was nice, but it is a lap pool, so you have to staya moving! There is a sauna in the womens lockeroom, which was very nice. The gym is nice too.

Pros: Rooms are very-well equipped with large Samsung 40\" plasmas, a comfortable lounge chair with ottoman, minibar and proper drinking glasses.

Contemporary designs with a soothing palate proliferate from the bright lobby right through to the pleasing in-room decor. Quality toiletries and fine shower pressure with instant hot water. Efficient ice machine. Elevators were always ready and open in the lobby. Close to the VIA central train station and Old Montreal with a vast assortment of shops and restaurants nearby. Cons: Work desk area lacks a practical desk chair that rotates and reclines. TV remote was odd, as each and every time one turned on the TV, one was met with a black screen in a strange input mode. One needs to press a channel e.g. \"002\" and wait several seconds to get any signal. I am sure this has confused many. Heat worked very well and operated at a low hum.

Our room was a double room with a view looking out onto the Convention Centre and Park in front of the hotel. Wonderful city view! It is worth the small charge to upgrade to a room with a view. The room was spotless, the bathroom is fantastic, with a tub and shower separate and a good size, the beds were very comfortable and the room felt spacious and contemporary. The hotel has very nice public spaces with a dark and sexy vibe with Art Deco furnishings and accoutrements. Osco, the restaurant, was beautiful and the buffet breakfast was above-average; everything fresh and tasty. My son, who is a picky eater, found many selections which he enjoyed. The staff; front desk, valet parking, bell staff, restaurant, pool & work-out facility, were all very gracious and helpful. The pool on the 10th floor was a nice added touch in an Old Montreal Hotel, which my son and I used everyday. It was extremely clean. It is a four-and-a-half foot deep rectangular lap pool, which adults and children were both using and enjoying. They provide kick boards and life vests for anyone with really little ones. We found the location of the InterContinental to be perfect; in Vieux (Old) Montreal. We walked to dinner every night; down to rue St-Paul, with numerous restaurants to choose from. Notre-Dame Basilica; the breath-taking Catholic church was a leisurely five minute walk away (bring your camera) and the Centre des Sciences de Montreal is also within walking distance down to the Old Port. The science centre is worth checking out, as is the Biodome de Montreal (a short drive away). If you have a CAA card, you will save on the admission for both these attractions.

It was booked through Priceline. During the booking process, we specified that our party consisted of 2 adults and 2 children. Apparently, all rooms booked through Priceline get a king bed standard but you can have the option of upgrading to 2 beds (for an additional $20/night) or king with pull-out (for an additional $30/night). Not sure why these options weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stated on Priceline, and why bother having a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when you are obligated to upgrade anyway. As other posters have stated, internet was $14/day. We have stayed at 4 and 5 star hotels where the internet was included and complimentary bottled water was available daily. Better to increase the rate and include these incidentals rather than drop the rate and nickel/dime everything. During check-in, I arrived earlier than my husband. Because my name was not on the reservation, I had to call my husband to have him add my name on. I understand and appreciate that this is a security issue. So I waited with my 2 young children while this was being sorted out. The front-desk clerk provided a number for my husband to call and he was on the phone for nearly 15 minutes while they were scrambling to find just the right contact person to deal with this situation. This was unfortunate and should\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been handled better. As an aside, my husband was on a train from Toronto and could easily been out of reach to even phone in. If that was the case, I would've been sitting in the lobby with 2 kids for 5 more hours. A little resourcefulness or other solutions would've been better than to simply say \"feel free to wait in the lobby\". On our second night at the hotel, our neighbours were having a loud party at 3:30AM. Two calls were made to the front desk and things quieted down after an hour. No apologies or follow-up after that incident. We dined in Osco (the hotel restaurant). The food was pricey but good. There is no children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s menu but they made a pasta dish for $8.

Its appearance ushered in a new era of luxurious accommodations to world travelers. This year the hotel made its grand rebirth. This AAA/CA four diamond hotel boasts \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the perfect blend of intimate boutique hotel atmosphere and the peerless service of a luxuryous four-diamond\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Such a build-up leaves world travelers with high expectations for their Old Montreal sojourn. On this occasion there were expectations fulfilled and some unfulfilled. The arrival is standard high class. The prompt, cordial bellman weaves you from the lower entrance way to the escalator for the flight up to check-in. The $29 Cdn per diem valet parking is reasonable and allows for in and out privileges at any time. A mid-afternoon check-in proceeded smoothly with only minor delays due to the number of receptionists left managing the many guests in line. The Priority Club level rooms are completely redone. There are fewer rooms with expansive suites. Our corporate manager recently left so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re uncertain whether our change in requests was due to the management change or the renovation. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room we entered was an oversized room with space for a couch. Our room had one pair of slippers for two guests. A call to the front desk quickly solved this problem. The scant three drawer clothing storage in the main entertainment unit gave prominent storage to the mini bar and coffee items leaving much of our items in our bag stored in the oversized closet. Our view from the corner room was partially obscured by the aluminum parapets jutting out from the higher floors. The bathroom had the corner shower, tub, and toilet all in one space. Another noticeable change is the relocation of the Club Room from its high floor location with sweeping panoramic views to a much smaller gathering spot immediately off the lobby with a view of the covered shopping mall outside the hotel rear. Evening Club Room hours are reduced to a two hour window from 5:30-7:30PM daily. The Concierge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location in the lobby includes management of the Club Room. The Concierge staffs and services both the needs of the Hotel along with the evening refreshments. The breakfast hours operate with the same juggling act. On both days of our stay we watched the concierge help rebook flights for guests while the food dwindled, the milk in the automatic espresso machine went empty, and serving dishes and utensils remained on vacated tables. The evening appetizers disappeared more quickly than they were able to be replenished. The automatic wine dispenser failed to operate and the concierge delivered wine to the table by the glass. With some prompting the Manager in charge accommodated our wine requests. The Concierge staff is knowledgeable and most accommodating. They offer directions, restaurant choices, and best use of Montreal's' well-developed public transportation. Be sure to avail yourself of their expertise.

There were line ups to use them and sometimes everyone had to wait for over 10 minutes to get one. They had a sign posted outside the elevator that said it was undergoing maintenance, but this appeared to be a rather permanent sign that was professionally prepared and posted. I suspect this has been an ongoing issue with this hotel. At one point there was a line up on my floor and we had to call the front desk as the elevator would not stop on our floor. We needed them to send staff to our floor to rescue us. The second issue I found was that everything was overpriced including the rooms and the extremely overpriced meals at the restaraunt. The hotel itself is overpriced compared to others and I would have stayed somewhere else if it was not for business and paid for by my employer. The evening when I arrived it was rather stormy outside and I was quite tired from the long flight.

Room rate was a little higher than I liked but that could be said about most hotels in Montreal that weekend with 80,000 people in town for a concert each night. We chose a rate that included breakfast and valet parking which basically worked out to free breakfast. The rooms were very nice and larger than I would have expected for a downtown location. Beds were very comfortable. Actually meant to check what kind they were since we are in the market to replace ours at home. The bathroom, again very nice and large, had a tub and separate large corner shower. The room rate does not include internet access which I think in this day and age should be standard but this seems to be the norm for luxury hotels. For those that want internet access, remember to ask for the $10/nt package when you check in which includes internet and long distance. If you use the internet without it, it will cost you $5 more per night and does not include long distance. The internet is wired, not wireless which is a bit of an annoyance when both of you have a computer plus the phones etc. but I now tend to pack an old wireless router when I travel to avoid the problem. As we were there for the U2 weekend the Metro had a special deal for unlimited use passes. Check-in was fast and efficient especially consider the number of people checking is as we arrived. When checking in the the front desk staff asked whether we were there for U2 and we provided were with an info package regarding and advised that they had a supply of the Metro passes there. Being able to buy them at the hotel was a blessing since the lineups to buy them at Metro station were very long. Hotel is right between 2 stations about a 5 minute walk in either direction. Not sure about getting to them underground because the whether was beautiful anytime we had to get there. The breakfast included in the rate was a buffet with was good and well above par for a hotel breakfast. Car never left the garage while we were there so only had to call the valet when we were leaving. Called 5 minute ahead of leaving the room and waited less than a minute for the car to pull up.

We had booked a 2-bed room with an irresistible view. When we arrived, we got to our room but we had been upgraded to a suite with a king size bed. Since I was with another male friend, the king size bed was not do-able - it's why we had booked (AND received a confirmation on) a room with 2 double beds. Thanks for the upgrade, but the \"upgraded\" view was horrible and the sleeping arrangements were unacceptable. When we went back down to the lobby to request our confirmed room. The desk attendant told us that there wasn't a room ready for us and \"I don't know when it will be ready\". It was around 4:00pm and we said we could wait for our room. \"It could be ready at EIGHT for all I know,\" she spat. We then were asked to go get our luggage out of the upgraded room so they could hold it for us until our new room was ready.At this point, we just wanted our room after our long flight but we were also hungry so we decided to get something to eat. In the meantime, my friend and I discussed that what SHOULD have happened at this point was that the clerk should have apologized for the mix up (which she didn't), offered someone to go get our bags FOR us (which she didn't) and comp us some sort of meal at the hotel (which they didn't). None of this was our fault (since our original confirmation had CONFIRMED a room that we never got. And we ended up suffering for it. I will tell you that the service at this hotel is horrible. We waited in line to initially check in for over 30 minutes; when we came back down for our right room, we waited for another 15 minutes. When we got back to check back in for our room after dinner, we waited (with 2 couples who were livid for having to wait so long) for over 20 minutes. I asked the concierge to help and call someone and she said i would have better luck waiting in the lobby. yeah, right. Then they said our luggage was already placed in our new room. It wasn't. We finally got our room which was amazing. Great view and great accommodations. But GETTING the right confirmed room wasted half of our first day of vacation. Thanks Intercontinental. Oh, and I forgot to mention that during our initial check in, another hotel guest asked to see the manager to show him damage to his car that the valet caused. good thing we had a taxi. Maybe there were new employees working. I don't care. They shouldn't be working on a busy weekend (Canada Day, fireworks expo, Jazz Festival) without being properly trained first. I blame management for that. I am a manager in customer service so I can say that and still sleep at night. Pool closed at 7:30pm. Not good.

There was a line of about six people in front of us and two clerks at the front desk. The guests were clearly frustrated, as were the clerks.

We went back down to the front desk, had to wait in line again (20 minutes this time) and both of the clerks were on walkie talkie devices and seemed very agitated. This time we got another clerk (should have gotten name). We informed her we went to our room, and were given the wrong room type. I asked to be moved to the correct room. She sighed and went back to the back office, came back out and then told us it may be \"as late as 8 oclock before it's ready if you want to be moved..you need to go get your luggage, check it at bell stand and come back later, as that room type was not ready yet\". She was very curt and cold in her tone. After doing what she said, we thought to ourselves that the professional thing for her to have done was to APOLOGIZE for their mixup in giving me the wrong room and then SENT STAFF up to the room to get the luggage and hold it for us. It was not right for me to have had to go get my own luggage in a self described \"FIVE STAR\" hotel and take it down to the basement once again to the bellstand.

We have received the upgrade to the Tourelle Suite ( on 13 floor, as we checked in late on a Friday evenenig, driving a mere 5 and a half hours from New York)- the higher floors were taken by 9 PM which is quite understandable. First of all the hotel is new , only 20 years in built and recently renovated, there is no doubt that it was clean and well maintained. Room service was on top , as a matter of fact next day morning we left the sign do-not-disturb on the door , and the room attendant saw us leaving and she still managed to enter and clean our suite while we were at the Inter Club Lounge, having free breakfast (as it was included with the Club Room Reservation). This in itself reminded me of a very personal caring and attention, similar to a Hay Adams , in DC where we had a personal attandant for our needs. Ok , soap , shampoo ? No problems . Towels, in the gym ? My partner who speak only english , had to ask the attendant a towel, but he did get it, and he moved on. I do not think that this is worth a comment , sometimes things are in place , you just have to look for it and as long as there is an attendant, as always is, will be solved. Elevators were 2 in operation, of which one was always grounded and ready to be taken for a quick ride up, which I found smart, as we never waited to get to our suite on the 13th floor. On the way down elevators were obviously slower (the price to pay-you don't have to be Einstein to figure it out!!), but was moving well , less that 2 min most of the times, maybe once we waited more than usual and it got busy , I assume a group was checking out , all at the same time, which is an exception to the rest of the times, not realy worth mentioning, it is a hotel , yes.. Overall the cultural events in the happenning like Easter, White Party and the Gaga events, etc ... are all related to the outside world of the hotel, we think Motreal is a very modern and relaxed place to be , never in the hotel we experienced other than quiet and laid-back cosmopolitan atmosphere, from staff and patrons as well, a very relaxing week-end indeed.. I meant to mention one more time that the best surprize was the afternoon access to the Club Inter, where Lea welcomed us to the one of the best buffet with wine degustation that I could not resist, it was as good as we practically skipped dinner Sat nite ( Do not tell this to nobody). In other words the pampering went against our will, and that in itself speaks miles towards the stars credit. (a 6 star service!). Although we were not familiar the Inter Montreal ,we were familiar with the Willard in DC (where we spent Palm Sunday ) and with the Boston Inter. We like them both, but we would thing ( despite the currency exchange rate) the Montreal Inter is the hiden gem!-right now.

We were returning to Montreal for Easter and wanted to try the Intercontinental for a change. We had stayed here 10 years ago when the hotel was newer. We were very disappointed and will not be back. We booked an Iconic Suite which is nice enough but nothing special. Our quoted price included a buffet breakfast. We tried the buffet breakfast for only 1 morning and preferred the smaller buffet in the Club lounge but only on weekends. On weekdays, the Club lounge is full of business travelers looking to get in and out really quickly. The hotel has gone down hill since its opening, regardless of the recent renovation in 2009. Service and staff are very absent. You are asked to request your car from the valet 20 minutes before you need it. We always asked for it 30 minutes prior to retrieving it and were always told by the bellman that no one had requested our car. Turn down service is not given unless you ask for it. Toiletries and amenities in the room are non-existent. We only got 1 mini bottle of shampoo and had to ask for extra every day. When we went to the pool and asked for towels, we were told that they were in short supply and needed to be conserved. That was the most unbelievable -- how is it that a luxury hotel is short on towels? This is unheard of. The common areas are also dirty. There was a Lady Gaga tour group staying at the hotel which made the property feel like roadie central. Pizza delivery guys roamed the hotel freely knocking on wrong doors to deliver pies. There was also a White Party across the street and, in the morning, a lot of ravers were stumbling into the hotel, shirtless and shoeless, to go to their rooms. Breakfast was nothing special. When we checked in, and told that breakfast was included in our rate, we asked if we could get it delivered to our room. We were told absolutely. When we ordered room service the following morning, we were socked with a $90 breakfast bill for eggs, coffee and fruit and told that room service was not part of our rate. I wouldn't mind so much if the breakfast was good, but it was actually pretty bad and not what we ordered either. We felt ripped off. The gym opens at 9am on weekends and closes early. On weekdays, it closes at 7pm. To the devoted work out crowd, this is bad news. All in all, the hotel is skimpy and not what you expect from a property which promises a luxury stay. The Sofitel and St. James in Montreal have this property beat hands down. I will probably never stay in another Intercontinental ever again. Finally, if an Intercontinental manager reads this review and wants to provide the normal \"sorry we didn't meet your expectations but you must be difficult\" type of reply, I recommend that your time would be better spent on evaluating your property and staff instead.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gatineau, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for a lesiurely weekend in Montreal\u201d", "Author": "bdyrck", "ReviewID": "UR105311037", "Content": "Having read some of the reviews before we went away, I was a bit concerned. I was very pleasantly surprised once we arrived. We had gotten our room on Hotwire & saved $100 - so check that option out. Our room was on the 22nd floor, facing the Montreal skyline. On a sunny day, we could see as far as the Olympic stadium. The location is great for those seeking some quiet time. The renovations were clearly well done, as the hotel seems ultra modern & chic. It is connected to the underground RES (reseau) - a series of underground walkways. You can virtually get to the orange line metro completely underground, while passing shops & art work. You leave the hotel & are in within Old Montreal within a matter of minutes. It's a very quiet area, which features other hotels (the Westin is right next door) and smaller boutique hotels that are further into Old Montreal. I didn't access the pool or restaurants, so I can't comment on that. There are two resteraunts within the hotel - one being more of a bar, the other called Osco. Also attached to the hotel is a Java U - a trendy coffee shop that offers sandwiches, coffee & other drinks at a reasonable rate. Attached to the exit of the hotel which faces the underground walkways are multitudes of stores, cafes & restaurants - convenient if you want a quick bite (i.e. Sushi Shop). The room itself was very well-appointed. The bathroom had a good deal of space, featuring a tub & shower that were separate from one another. The bedroom area featured a queen-sized bed with comfy linens & feather filled pillows. I can see that if you were staying for longer than 2-3 days, the lack of sitting area in the room could get tiresome. However, I was not on a Club Level floor, so I'm assuming those rooms are bigger. I didn't use the concierge service, but we did stow our bags before we left the city, which was a good feature. Room service prices were typical for a 4 star hotel. If you do wish to order, do so during the day - prices skyrocket on the night menu (i.e. a Caesar salad jumps from $10 to $25!). I also didn't use the parking service, but it was clear there was valet at the street entrance on Saint Antoine. internet was at a fee of $15 a day. We were offered a special for $10 that featured unlimited local calls (which normally cost $1.50 per call) & wireless. Overall, I thought this hotel was great for our needs. I would definitely return in a heartbeat! If you are looking for more of a party atmosphere, I would suggest something else that's closer to downtown.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut, USA", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in a great location, but not without flaws\u201d", "Author": "PassThroughCustoms", "ReviewID": "UR105165755", "Content": "My son and I were in Montreal for a recent trip to see McGill University and the city. The Intercontinental is located very close to Old Montreal, but is still within walking distance to downtown, shopping, and McGill (if you're willing to walk 30 minutes or so). The hotel is across the street from the Palais des Congres. It is also on the RESO which is worth figuring out if you are in Montreal in inclement weather. The RESO is the \"underground city\" where commercial buildings and malls are interconnected underground. You can walk out of the rain, snow, and auto traffic over a significant part of downtown Montreal. The concierge was very helpful with how we could walk to McGill from the hotel, avoiding the rain the entire way. The RESO is awesome and the hotel is perfectly situated on it. We self parked for $22 a day rather than valet park. To access the lot, you turn off St. Antoine onto St. Pierre and the garage is immediately on the right. The front desk staff were efficient, and check-in took less than two minutes. The room we had (two double beds) was roomy and the bathroom has a separate bathtub and shower. There was a flat screen TV with a basic selection of channels, many in French. There is a safe in the cabinet which was big enough to store a 15\" laptop, a DSLR camera, a few lenses, and more. The internet is pricy at $14.50 a day, but it seemed pretty fast. The pool was OK. It's basically a small lap pool. The fitness center staff provide a towel when you sign in. There is a sauna and a steam room in the change room. We didn't use the rest of the fitness center with the equipment. The location, as I said, is great. You just walk out of the hotel and head down St. Pierre street and you are in Old Montreal. From there, turn left on Notre Dame, and the Basilica is a short stroll down the street. We walked from the hotel to Crescent and Ste. Catherine in about 25 minutes. The walk from the hotel to McGill via the RESO took about 30 minutes, and that included soaking up the sights along the way. Tip for photographers visiting the Notre Dame Basilica - I recommend an ultrawide-angle lens and tripod. I didn't have my tripod, so I was shooting ultrawide at 10mm and ISO 3200 for 1/10 or 1/20 second handheld. A tripod would have been much easier though, and then I could have shot long exposures at f/11 at base ISO. Anyway, back at the hotel, one problem we experienced were the elevators. There are four elevators, but only one appeared to be functioning. What this meant was sometimes long waits for elevators, and sometimes when they eventually arrived, they were totally full. We were only in Montreal for 2 days, but if the trip was longer or if I was on business, the elevators would have been an unnacceptable nuisance. It did not appear anyone was working on them either. The stairs are not a realistic option because the room floors start at floor 10. The other issue that prevents a 5 out of 5 rating are \"the little things.\" When we checked into our room for the first time, there were no facecloths and no soap. A cart with dirty room service stuff on it from a nearby room sat in the hallway for a while one morning (at least several hours). There was a long hair (not mine or my son's) on one of the pillows. The TV remote was disgustingly dirty. Despite the issues above, I would stay at the Intercontinental again. Other than the elevator problem, the minor flaws we noticed are procedural that management should be able to correct through training of the cleaning and room service staff. The elevator problem is also fixable, but it requires the hotel recognizing that they need to spend the requisite money - probably significant - to properly maintain their elevators in working condition.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "DEN", "Title": "\u201cOUTSTANDING IN ALL AREAS\u201d", "Author": "CHIEF9", "ReviewID": "UR104153734", "Content": "My wife and I had a wonderful long weekend at the Intercontinental in Montreal--we were upgraded to a suite and in turn were afforded access to Club Intercontinental.

The location is opposite the Palais de Congres conference centre, with an interconnecting tunnel so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to go outside during bad weather. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also on the old town side making it convenient to explore the old town on foot.

We drove up from the Boston area - looking for that \"valet\" parking which was not in sight. We parked on the street behind about 10 cars and I walked in looking for someone to help. I waited about 10 minutes to find out you park on the street and drop your key. No help with bags. :( Another issue we had is that our key did not work, so I had to schlepp back downstairs to get new keys. The hotel itself is well located and beautifully appointed. The room was nice - it was a good size, but the window looked directly into another room \"Intimate King\", so we had to keep the drapes closed. Bathroom was outdated, rusty in spots,terrible tub, backed up, etc. Not what you expect for $250 a nite. Breakfast was OK, not great. Usual buffet. We brought our laptop to research activities but were put off by the $14.50 a day charge to connect. Overall we paid about $552 for 2 nites, parking and breakfast.

I am a gold ambassador who had not stayed at this hotel before (I stay regularly at the two Intercontinentals in Toronto for both business and leisure). I booked our stay using an (old version) ambassador weekend certificate. We booked a \"For Foodies Package\" which was supposed to include a \"Deluxe Irresistible 1 King Bed\" Room, a full buffet breakfast for both of us each day at Osco (the hotel restaurant), free internet, two free cocktails at the hotel bar (Absinthe) and a \"foodies package restaurant coupon booklet\" which included (as you may have guessed) restaurant discounts and 4 metro bus or subway tickets. We arrived early and left our bags with the bellman/valet and wandered the city. When we came back at 4 p.m. to check-in there was a wedding party entering the hotel (which, someone told us, was an Alouette football player's wedding) and a huge crowd of pre-teen girls waiting outside (who we later found out were waiting for the Jonas Brothers, who were staying at the hotel). It all made for a very crowded entryway and lobby reception. As mentioned, the lobby was very crowded and the line for check-in quite long. When I finally made it to the reception desk (we didn't see an ambassador check-in area at all during the weekend) the young man informed me that we had been upgraded to a \"tourelle suite\" (corner suite on the turret side of the hotel, facing the city) but that the room wasn't ready (which it was supposed to be) and he asked me to come back in 45 minutes. We went and had a coffee in the attached \"Java\" coffee house and came back up 50 minutes later. When I made it back to reception, I was informed that my room still wasn't ready. He offered me another \"Inspiring\" corner room on a club floor but, as we already had breakfast and a couple drinks included with our package and wanted a suite, we declined and offered to wait until the tourelle suite was ready. He called housekeeping and they told him it would be ready in half an hour. We decided to grab a drink in the bar (Absinthe). We both really liked the bar atmosphere and the servers were great. My wife really liked the absinthe cocktails (we came back for a couple more drinks during our stay). 45 minutes later, I wandered back out to the reception desk - by this time there was a huge crowd of people in the lobby waiting for their rooms to be ready. I got a young, dark-haired lady this time and she apologized but said the room still wasn't ready. She too called up to housekeeping, and was told they were in the room cleaning and would be done in 20 minutes. She apologized again, and gave me a couple of free drinks at the bar, which we enjoyed. When I came back, the room was finally ready. However, I was not offered the drink tickets, breakfast vouchers or any of the other things included in my package. I asked for them and she seemed perplexed so I pulled out my blackberry and showed her the reservation and the things included. She did not seem to have heard of the package before, but quickly gave me two drink tickets, and four breakfast vouchers. She had no idea what the coupon booklet was and had no metro passes, so we decided to head up to our room without them as all of the hotel staff were presently occupied. My gift once arrived during turndown service (this time with three dark chocolate and three white chocolate/coconut truffles). My wife thought these were very good (I am not a big chocolate lover - but she sure is!). The room was great, large bedroom with door, very large sitting area with a couch, desk and two armchairs with ottomans and coffee table, and a great view of the city. We enjoyed our two buffet breakfasts at Osco - the food selection was quite good and they had an omelet/scrambled egg station that provided made-to-order goodness. Service in the restaurant was good, but they were very busy on the Monday and seemed understaffed as the two waiters couldn't clean the tables fast enough to prevent a large line from growing even though there were many empty tables. On the last day we decided to wander around some more and take advantage of our 4 p.m. checkout. When we arrived back to the room at 2 p.m., our keycards did not work so we went down to reception. They had been deactivated as it was past normal checkout (but not ambassador late-checkout). He reactivated one card so we could get back in the room to get our belongings (he originally offered to take us up without giving us a card, which I declined). I had not been given a copy of my bill to this point (at all of the other Intercontinental's I had stayed at, one had always been slid under the door before I got up the last day) so I asked for one and we went up to the room. I noticed that we had been charged for internet each day (included in our package) and for local calls. When I checked out I mentioned this and they were promptly removed, with apologies. Other notes - I did not receive my paper on the Monday, even though I was asked if I wanted one. They did provide them on each floor next to the elevators, so I grabbed one from there. I also never received my coupon book or metro tickets. Despite a few snafus, we honestly did enjoy our stay and the hotel. In particular, the upgrades, provision of ambassador benefits on a reward night, the bar and the breakfast at Osco were all great. We also were impressed with the young, female concierge, who provided impeccible service.

Three minute walk from Metro station to the market. Visit Crepe Suzzette (3 St-Paul St E) for outstanding crepes and fondues. We shared the \"La Symphonie\" dessert crepe (fresh fruit with vanilla custard sauce). 14$ CAD crepe ... Worth every cent. Great site to \"people watch\". From YUL airport, take 747 Express bus (7$ CAD one-way) to the Intercontinental Montreal. Taxi fare is 38$ CAD. Purchase Bus pass from kiosk outside of baggage area or pay bus driver (Canadian Coins Only NO paper money or US dollars). Hotel is 1/2 block from Old Montreal and 2-3 blocks from Notre Dame.

On the other hand, the hotel's policies really hampered our stay, with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nickel and diming\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Internet, $15 a day (or $8 for 2 hours, there are Internet shops that make all their money from Internet services that charge less than that); Early check-in (if available), $25; Late check-out (even just a half-hour), another $25; Breakfast starts at $20 for juice, coffee and two pastries; Room service, additional fee, etc etc. It really felt like every request we had incurred an extra fee, which is absolutely not what a top-class hotel should feel like. I mean, if you were spending one night for a meeting in Montreal and your flights meant that you had to check in before 4pm and leave after noon, that's $50 extra right there, just for absolutely standard services that every other hotel (even the Holiday Inn Express brand in the same chain) is happy to offer for free! If a room is not ready for early check-in, that's perfectly understandable; but how is it fair to say your room is ready but if you don't wait around until 4pm, you have to pay extra? This isn't some kind of pay-by-the-hour flophouse! If you get a good deal on the price, I would recommend the Intercontinental. I feel kind of bad about being so negative because none of the staff provided any bad service, nor were the facilities below standard. I just feel that in a 4 or 5-star hotel, you expect to be encouraged to approach the staff, to make any requests that you need, and that the establishment should try to accommodate these out of goodwill to enhance your stay as a valued guest. By the end of my stay, I felt like it wasn't even worth asking for anything because I'd just have to pony up, or feel embarrassed to decline because of the fees. If you stay here, you will not be disappointed by the staff or the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just expect to add an extra 20% or so to your quoted rate, so you don't feel disappointed by that part either.", "Date": "November 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southeast USA", "Title": "\u201cAcceptable but nothing special, and don't expect anyone to be friendly.\u201d", "Author": "Southern_Maam", "ReviewID": "UR49442453", "Content": "The room has nice amenities. I liked the separate shower and bathtub and the big screen TV. The sheets and towels were in the high quality category but nothing special, the bath amenities were similarly high quality but nothing special, the staff were professional but nothing special, room service was good (for room service) but nothing special. \"Acceptable but nothing special\" describes the entire hotel, which is why the best adjective I can come up with is \"nice\". The waiting times at reception were very long, and there never seemed to be enough help. When I checked in, the receptionist spent a solid minute explaining how the mini bar could not be tricked, as it had a computerized system with various failsafes built in. For instance, keeping the door of the minibar open for more than one minute would cause you to be charged. Needless to say, I did not feel like a welcome guest, nor did I use the minibar the entire time I was there. The staff was professional, but the amount of friendliness I experienced was directly proportional to the amount they thought I would tip. I usually tip quite well - especially for a place like Montreal, where tipping seems to be on the low 15%-ish side. Only what I consider a quite generous tip would generate any sort of genuine thanks - well, faux genuine - let's say, they put some effort into their thanks. I wasn't inspired to do that many times, only a few when I did ask for something I would consider \"extra\". This illustrates the entire staff's attitude: I called reception the day before arrival to let them know what time our flight would be landing, and asked if they could try to have our rooms ready around 1pm (2 hours before regular check-in time). The manager's response was that for $25 per room (and we had 7 rooms) he could guarantee early check-in. I asked him if he could just be aware and _try_, and he replied that no, he could not, but that for $25 per room he could guarantee it. (Other members of our group on the same flight were staying at 3 other nearby hotels, and those hotels all agreed, with no problem, to help us with early check-in - and they provided it, too.) There were 2 better-than-blah experiences. One: I had one excellent room service meal, but only because I stopped by the restaurant and ordered from the chef's daily specials, instead of using the room service menu. Two: I received excellent service from the concierge, who I noticed wore the keys of a professional concierge on his collar. I expect his professional \"friendliness\" was more the result of his professional training, and less the result of the influence of the hotel. Only a highly conscientious professional could keep from showing their cynicism in such a working environment. I'm not giving perfect marks on cleanliness, because one of my drawers had pastry crumbs and a bakery bag left in it; and, because the pool tiles needed to be cleaned, although the water seemed well-maintained. However, I do believe that the room was generally cleaned well. I am recommending this hotel, with the above caveats, because (1) you do get exactly what you pay for - no more, but no less, either - and (2) it is directly across the street from the Palais des Congres conference center, and that is a wonderful thing if you're at a conference. If you're not at a conference, there is absolutely no reason to stay at this hotel.", "Date": "November 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cquiet hotel, interesting area...\u201d", "Author": "StamfordRaffles", "ReviewID": "UR49417373", "Content": "Loved Montreal, although most of the people there kept telling me Quebec was more beautiful!
