The staff are great, very helpful and friendly. The hotel is at a good location within walking distance of the sights - staff will provide a map, which is very helpful. The rooms are comfortable and have a great view if you pay the extra cost to look over the harbour, which is worth it. It is a bonus having a small but fully equipped kitchen. The Royal Botanic Gardens are definately worth a visit, even if it's just to see the wildlife or sit and watch the boats on the harbour. There is a supermarket across the road and a fair selection of restaurants. The Fountain cafe on the corner next to the pedestrian crossing serves a great breakfast at a reasonable price. On Saturday there is a small market in the park area which also sells some great food and cakes! It is a fair walk to Darling Harbour but it is definately worth it. You also pass some great buildings and parks on the way. The area of Kings Cross is only a short walk away with lively bars, nightlife and internet cafes. The only negative point is that the area is about a 30 minute drive from the airport. The train involves a few changes and a journey of about an hour so its easier to get a shuttle bus from the airport, which will take you to the door of your hotel for about the same price $16. Book tickets at the information desk at the airport. The bus/train transfers don't start until 7am so if you have an early flight you will have to get a taxi, which was $45.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThird bed terrible and noisy bathroom\u201d", "Author": "MarcoITA77", "ReviewID": "UR125855486", "Content": "I booked a room for three and I am trying to sleep in the third one, IMPOSSIBLE, better a tent!!!

It was the first time I'd ever done that (I normally pick something out of a guide book and confirm with a review). I was not disappointed. I was absolutely thrilled with the view that greeted me every morning and every evening when I came home. The bridge and opera house are THE iconic symbols of Sydney and having a view of both imprinted on my mind is a lovely souvenir and definitely worth the extra dollars to get it. In addition, the staff at Macleay were super helpful. Every question I asked them they answered cheerily and I had a real feeling that they wanted to make their guests' visits to Sydney the best they could be. The room itself is absolutely adequate rather than luxurious but it was clean and had useful facilities that mean I could save a bit of money by having breakfast there. Potts Point is a lovely location because it's easy to get to a train station (Kings Cross is 10 mins walk away), you can walk to the botanical gardens and round to the opera house (about 45 mins) or catch a bus right opposite the hotel. In addition, there's a fast bus to Bondi as well as a bus that goes to the smaller, pretty coves up at Watson's bay. I definitely recommend this as a base for a Sydney stay. I was there five days/four nights and I certainly didn't tire of the view!

That wasn't the only issue though... -there was toilet paper wrapped around the fire alarm (um, safety hazard?) -the table and chair in the room looked like it was lawn furniture -the ceiling was that awful popcorn nasty stuff -there was only the door knob lock (the chain for the chain lock was missing and the bolt from the deadbolt appeared to have been removed) -the light in the room was a bare light bulb (no fixture around it) Oh, and the murphy bed. Really? On a higher note, I'm sure the views from the hotel are lovely (we had a sample of what the nice views would look like from our room. The location is both good and bad - if you're young and into clubbing/bars/great shopping, I'd heard Kings Cross (very nearby) is awesome. However, if you are travelling with anyone over the age of 40, I wouldn't recommend taking them through Kings Cross at night.

The bus stop in either direction is a short walk from the front door and the city bus will take you to Circular Quay in one direction and the railway station in the other We had a studio apartment and were able to make our breakfast and occasionally lunch. The apartment was on the eighth floor and from our window we could see the Sydney harbour bridge and the opera house. In the other direction was a marina. The view was unobstructed and a real asset. In fact, one morning we saw the Mercury (which was to become our home away from home for a month) sail into the harbour. It's not often one can say, \"We saw our ship come in!\" Although the furnishings could do with an update, our apartment was certainly clean and comfortable. It was serviced daily. The rate was reasonable given Sydney's prices that we found to be high by Canadian standards. The best of all, however, was the staff. Although the accommodation was only 3 1/2 stars, the service was 6 stars. The staff was exceptionally helpful and couldn't do enough for us. In other locations we had stayed in excellent hotels but none exceeded the service provided by the staff of the Macleay. Lest you think I am on the payroll of the Macleay, nothing could be further from the truth. However, if we ever return to Sydney - a real possibility because we fell in love with the city - we are going to stay at the Macleay. If you are going to stay there, ask for a room with a harbour view. There is another building going in next to the Macleay that may obstruct the lower floors so ask for the eighth or ninth floor.", "Date": "April 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Western Australia", "Title": "\u201cLoved the views and friendly Staff\u201d", "Author": "w-j-b1954", "ReviewID": "UR14650359", "Content": "A friend and I recently stayed for 5 nights at the Macleay, we thoroughly enjoyed the visit...great location we walked through the Botanical Gardens to Circular Quay on several occassions, we ate at surrounding restaurants.

When we booked, we were told that there were only rooms with city views left, but that that would get us an invite up on to the roof for the fireworks at both 9pm and 12pm. However, when we checked in, we were gobsmacked by the view we had. Unobstructed views of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge to our left, and the north headlands to our right (7th floor, can't remember what room). We literally could have sat in our room and had one of the best views in the city! We had an Australian friend staying in the room with us who lives just outside of Sydney, and she said that it was one of the best view of the fireworks that she had experienced, and without having to fight your way through the crowds to get a drink. In the morning, we went down to collect the local newspaper and found that the photo of the fireworks on the front page had been taken from the roof of the Macleay for the 3rd year running!! Yes, the rooms are a bit dowdy, but the staff were polite and helpful, and the hotel is not actually in the red light district. We walked through that area a couple of times, but it was amusing rather than threatening!! Actually didn't see anything to write home about other than a homeless man being propositioned for $8!! The rooms are compact - especially for 4 adults, but we were warned of that by the hotel before booking. The kitchenette is small with few amenities, however, with some creativity, we managed to cook a full English breakfast for 4 adults on New Years Day!!

It is maybe an extra A$15 (EUR10) per night, and for that you also get a quieter room, away from the traffic. How many times will you be coming back to Sydney? Over the course of a week, we stayed in 3 rooms here, all of them different. The Marriott it ain't. The air conditioning broke in the first room, after it was unable to cope with being turned off for an hour (huh?). The second was slightly less convenient - on which more below - and since we hadn't fully moved in we plumped for the one next door to our original room. The staff are excellent and were able to check us in at 11am - rooms are cleaned in an order which suits the guests, which sounds obvious but rarely happens. It's fair to say that the accommodation is a little basic and could probably do with some renovation. You are not going to be able to cook a gourmet meal here, but it's fine for an omlette and toast. Chief amongst the problems are a lack of storage space in many rooms. Our first room - a wooden floored space - had drawers within the bed. The second had basically nothing, and the third was ok. There are two types of room with a view. Some face the eastern end of the harbour, others face the Bridge and Opera House. (The hotel won't guarantee which you will get by paying for the view, but it's worth asking anyway.) The latter is, as you would expect, spectacular. However, the rooms here seem to be more dated, and they are also over the road, which means more noise, though 9 floors up that won't bother anyone used to living in a city. The views facing the other way are not so bad either, it should be said. The location is not bad. Most people, including my 70 year old mother-in-law, could walk into the CBD and back comfortably, though it's rather hilly (hence the views). Kings Cross station is a 10 min walk away, and from there you can get to Bondi or to the central district. If you're trying to get to the main tourist attractions, walking might be more convenient than changing trains. Since the bus only runs every half hour, we didn't bother with it. Taxis run past all the time, including 5am when we had to leave for the airport. Don't bother booking. Yes, Kings Cross is a red light district, but it isn't so bad (and it's one of the few places in the city where you can eat late - everyone else seems to go to bed early here). Anyway, the hotel is outside that strip, in a fairly pleasant mainly residential street. Overall, we'd be happy to stay here again and probably wouldn't bother looking anywhere else, unless the rooms with views were all unavailable.

The interior as a whole is shabby, dingy and uncared for. The elevator floor could not have been cleaned in some time. Rooms, although clean, were cheaply furnished and poorly decorated with only the wonderful view to compensate. However, our ninth floor second room had only a partial view, as half of the room width window had been boarded up with unpainted rough plywood.

The apartments are in a realy good area- Potts Point, next to loads of little cafes and bars and only a short walk down to Woolloomooloo water front where there is loads of good bars and restaurants- and Harry De Wheels food place. It is close to Kings Cross, but to be honest i didn't find the place scarey at all- either through the day or night. The staff at the Macleay were all really helpfull, and told us how to get around Sydney and where to go. We were very tired when we got there - (after 22hours travelling from the UK), and got there at 9am- but they let us check in early. Our apartment was one of the newly refurbished apartments, so it was all new, lots of mirrors, wood floors and new furnishings. The only gripe would be there was no where to store your clothes etc and had to live out of our suitcases. The little kitchen was fine- you could make toast or snadwiches in it- don't think you could cook a full meal- but it was fine for snacks etc. Did have a look in the older apartments and they didn't look half as nice as ours- so if you get put into a old one ask to be changed to a newer one. One point though- the windows don't look very safe- we had a bad storm one night (night of 1st Jan after 44c temps!) and the windows above us blew out ground below.
