We had a room overlooking the streeet so there was some street noise but nothing from inside the building itself. The staff at reception are really friendly and helpful and the hotel is ideally situated within walking distance of all the main sites (we walked nearly everywhere) but is also close to the bus routes, taxis and a Metro station. Away from the restaurants on the Via Venuto there are some lovely restaurants and coffee shops that are really friendly and a Spar supermarket should you need it.

First Day We arrived, registered and went to the room. First impresion was OK, we've checked the bed, toilet and the room seems clean. We went for a walk and came back at 11:00 pm we wanted to watch TV, but the television didn't work. Also the temperature inside the room was a bit cold so I wanted to use the bedspread, but I couldn't as it has marks of ejaculation, how gross. Second day; Woke up with back pain as the beds are uncomfortable and hard. I called the reception in he morning and requested a TV exchange. The lady agreed to send some technician. We spent the day visiting Vatican Museum and St Peter Basilica. We arrive at 10:00 pm the TV still not being repared. I called again and a guy at the reception apologised and said he will send somebody in the next morning. Third day I felt I lose the battle and I am not going to ruin my days in Rome because the useless management do not bother to fix the TV. Fourth day Went to hand back the room key and the guy at the reception apologises again and he kindly did not apply the overnight charges introduced in some hotels in Italy, 12 euros BIG DEAL. We left the premises and travelled back to London. I felt upset because I though we had a great deal, but for the next time I will pay more for my stay and get a great Roman Holiday. A Customer doesn't need apologies, we need actions, if something is not working in the room the Manager must fixed, if something is not clean, just change it. I really do not like the italian attitude. Business means business. In the time we live a small detail makes a big difference and a happy Customer will return to the Residenza Borghese also with a nice review.

When we returned from a walk on our first day, one of the Managers ( a small man with a mustache) ushered me into our room. He accused me in front of my Sons of having damaged the writing table and he pointed to an area on the table where the veneer had crinkled and lifted. He said that they would have to get the table repaired and it would cost 180 euros. He said I would have to pay this. He spoke to me like I was a criminal rather than a guest. I was totally shocked since we had been in the room less than 24 hours. I told him I was unaware of what happened the table and that the only thing we had used that table for was to have breakfast .(They serve a breakfast in the room because there is no common dining area. In the room itself the only place it is possible to sit and eat is at this cheap veneered table.) He said I must have put someting hot on it. I said I did not recall anything been placed on it apart from the breakfast utilities.. He said I should think about it and he left the room. In the meantime I pointed out to him that the bathroom radiator was not working. He said dismissively that it was not his problem as it was controlled via the building heating system. The next morning on checking out he insisted on me paying for the alleged damages which I reluctantly did. This experience completely ruined our weekend. I did nothing wrong but was treated like a criminal rather than a guest. The Man had the most appalling manner and was abrupt , rude and dismissive. I do not know what happened the cheap veneer table. Perhaps the damage happened before we arrived although he insisted it did not. Perhaps some drops of hot water spilled, I do not know. It was a cheap table with very little value and you are expected to eat breakfast on it. There is no doubt in my mind that I was fraudently robbed and I am making an official complaint to the Commune di Roma and Apt prov Roma. I have also complained to Last minute.com. This is not a hotel. It is a group of rooms let to holiday makers and managed on site. They are not apartments since apartments provide cooking facilites.The furniture and finishings in the main bedroom are cheap and clearly not built to withstand any wear and tear. They are not of hotel standard but rather are like something bought from Ikea. Incidentally the shower outlet was partially blocked judging by the fact that the shower tray filled up very quickly with water and began to overflow. I am certain that if there had been water damage I would have been blamed and billed. I am sincerely advising you to stay clear of this accomodation. It is neither one thing or another. There is a real possibility that you will be accused of causing some damage. For example some things that presently do not work properly are: Bathroom door has no lock and does not close completely. Shower tray as described above. Radiator in bedroom not funtioning I travel a lot and this is undoubtedly my worst experience ever.

The room stunk of smoke, and when I let the gentleman at the reception know my son had asthma he could care less, and said it was too bad because the room was non refundable. We had a room facing the street, and we could hear cars from the adjacent streets, as well as everyone walking by. Breakfast is served in the room, with only one chair to sit on. You get one croissant, and a few dry rolls with nutella and jam, and some yoghurt with usually no spoon to eat it with. Coffee is instant cappuccino which is pretty disgusting. Coming from Venice and Florence where the hotels lived up to expectations, and the pictures and reviews, this was very very disappointing. The guy at reception offered that we could move to a larger room for $75 Euros, but the room was old and smelled, and the comforter looked very suspicious, so we elected to stay in the room that resembled a family jail cell.

My husband read them once I had booked and made me try to cancel the reservation, especially as we were travelling with my in laws and our 15 month old baby. This wasn\u2019t possible and to be honest I am SO GLAD it wasn\u2019t. Our experience at Residenza Borghese was really wonderful. The staff were extremely friendly and went out of their way to help us at all times. We arrived during the day and travelled from the airport with a taxi that Jean kindly booked for us. Therefore we didn\u2019t have any problems finding the hotel. I can see how it can be a bit daunting to arrive at night and have to look for the property. However, it\u2019s really not the end of the world if you have to search a bit your first time. Once inside the characteristic entrance you have to take the second lift on the right up to the second floor. This wasn\u2019t clearly stated beforehand but again, not the end of the world. We were welcomed so warmly by Jean that any doubts we had about staying here soon faded away. The rooms were extremely clean and very modern with tea/coffee making facilities in the room. The size of the room was more than substantial and had plenty of space for the baby cot. The lift is tiny but this is usual in a building of this age. The view from the bedroom was of the courtyard used by other residents of the building (a mix of office workers and apartment residents). To be honest it wasn\u2019t the best view but I wouldn\u2019t expect anything different from a building of this type. At the end of the day it is an old building in an ancient city. I wasn\u2019t there for the view from my bedroom window! The breakfast is served in your room and consisted of bread rolls, croissants (plain and chocolate), cereal, crispbreads, jam, butter, cream cheese and yoghurts. It\u2019s a continental breakfast with no hot items but is more than enough. The hotel never claims to be a conventional hotel and rightly so. The rooms are based in a characteristic building in one of the best possible locations in Rome. We walked from the hotel to most places we needed to go. There are great transport links nearby and you can book tours through the hotel that pick you up and bring you back to the hotel. Jean and Kevin made some excellent suggestions of restaurants nearby where we ate some outstanding meals. To be honest, I would not hesitate to stay here again and will recommend it to family and friends.

And, hard to believe, it had some good reviews (must be the hotel employees writing). What a horrible experience. When I got to Via Sardegna 55, it looked like an abandoned building. I thought I was at the wrong place, and went back to the computer to verify the address. Unbelievable, it was the right address. I looked at the buzz names and found 19 \u2013 Residenza Borghese. As I pressed it, the (huge) door started opening without anyone saying anything. I felt myself in a thrill film, coming into an abandoned dirty castle, through a gallery filled with closed doors. No signs anywhere indicating where to go. I go up on the elevator, floor by floor, and nothing \u2013 no one shows up, all doors closed, no signs of hotel. I go back to the main door, now afraid, and press the button again. Now I wait for someone to say something, and a voice come in informing that I should take the second elevator down the hall, not the first one. At this time I have regretted 100% having booked at this \u201cplace\u201d. What they call hotel or guest house is 3 floors of a strange building that they transformed into a pension. The \u201creception\u201d is at one of the little rooms (probably apartments that were transformed into rooms, divided by wood walls). A Japanese lady, does not even let me speak about how afraid I am. Rather, she started telling me how well I would feel in the room and that she would be able to help me with any needs while in Rome. As described here by other reviews, \"Climate Controlled\" rooms apparently means that you have to open wide the room window that faces an ugly alley, after which you will be hearing your neighbors to fight or have private parties - all night. Remember, this is an apartment building, and, after all these people are in their own houses. Smell of cigarette will come through to your room all night. A/C does not work \u2013 at all!!!!!!! The room is so small that I was about to find out who was the magician able to take the picture that is on the site and that makes you think it is a nice decent-sized place. Breakfast is a joke - ridiculous!!!!!!! Croissant and nutella and jam \u2013 nothing else. No juice, no bread, no fruit. Don\u2019t complaint, you cannot get your money back. Every night, when you come in, you have to ring a bell (that has a little paper on it saying do not ring, but the receptionist said to please ring, and he would open the hall door) and wake up everyone else on the same hallway. It makes you feel very uncomfortable. The beds were the worst I have experienced in my life. It is really bad, and you will have back pain during your stay in Rome. And if you need anything, like I needed a plate and a knife, to eat my prochutto, they will not bring to you \u2013 they don\u2019t want you to eat in the room \u2013 so you keep asking and they keep telling you that they will bring it up. Consider this a HIGH RISK place. This place is a series of apartments on different floors in different parts of a dilapidated apartment block. Managed & owned by some amateurs. After you book, if you get here and change your mind, there is no way to decline the charges. Moreover, check out is at 10 am, instead of noon - and they will not let you stay till noon, unless you pay $50 Euros. This is not a hotel.

Location: The hotel is located in a side street of upper Via Veneto. It took us 25 min walking from Stazione Termini to get there. If you are walking from town, it takes about 15 min permanently uphill from the Spanish Steps, and about 35 min from the Forum Romanum to get to the Hotel, so for us, although we are really good on foot, not a suitable location for getting to the hotel during the day for a break within the sightseeing program. In the evening, there is nothing to do around, we felt more like being in the outskirts like in the centre of Rome. Hotel: If you look at the hotel\u2019s homepage you get the impression of a somehow upscale little boutique hotel, but in fact, this is not what it is. The Hotel itself seemed strange to us. It looks like the owners have bought some apartments in a normal building and re-constructed them into guest rooms \u2013the reception is in the 2nd floor, they call it \u201clobby\u201d, but in fact, you do not feel really convenient sitting there. The rooms are distributed over two parts of the building with other flats not belonging to the hotel also situated around there. All rooms are facing different inner courtyards what makes them quite dark inside. The room itself was small, what is not unusual for a hotel in Rome, but nevertheless, we felt more like being in a prison cell like in a hotel room. Approximately 3-4 guest rooms are sharing the same floor, and every time other guests return to their room, you can hear the floor door slam. You can also hear every noise coming from the inner courtyards. The room was modern and very clean, which was the best thing, but there is a total lack of ambience to it. On top, for the fact that it opened just recently, it already starts to look a bit worn out, maybe the materials used are not the best ones. There is no real table in the room, just a desk, and no water boiling facility. The breakfast is served in the second floor, also in a kind of re-constructed apartment opening to an inner courtyard \u2013they serve croissants, jam, nutella, coffee, juice, flakes, yoghurt and toast. The breakfast was ok, but we missed some cheese to have something \u201cnot-sweet\u201d. Taken together, we would not recommend staying here, if you are looking for a hotel in the middle of Rome. It was ok, but somehow strange and not what we expected it to be.", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna", "Title": "\u201cso lala...\u201d", "Author": "kaffeepause", "ReviewID": "UR61297657", "Content": "First of all, this is NOT a hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This company just bought a few flats in a normal renting house and converted them in smaller rooms and suites. If you come back from a day in rome, you had to ring a bell and (sometimes they're asked your name etc.) buzzed you in, through the second door as well. Then to get into your room, they had to open the original flat door to let you in and then you could get to your room. How complicated is that!!!!! I had booked a suite for 7nights, it was my birthday and I traveled with my mom and I live in a different country, so we don't see each other that often. SO I wanted to have something nice....... The room and bathroom were nice and modern. TV is only Italian. We had our poor breakfast in the room every morning. The girl who brought us the breakfast, didn't understood a single word and was very moody. The coffee was always lukewarm, two pieces of pastry, two rusks, two juices (very nasty) and if we were lucky yoghurt and a huge amount of butter and jam etc. Which was laughable, because we had only two pieces of pastry. The only table was a writing desk and the tray was placed there of course.My mom used the only chair in the room and I was sitting on the footstool to had my breakfast... Need I say more? Why we had such a bad service, I don't know. I booked a suite for sake....... We got woken up every morning by people who had there offices in this house. They had a smoke in the small yard and were talking and talking, well they're Italians.... and banged the door so loud and often. Two nights we couldn't get some sleep, because a resident had the TV so loud you heard every word. The lady and three gentlemen we met from the reception area, were all very friendly. The house in itself was very nice appointed and so was the area.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Italy", "Title": "\u201cUnforgettable holiday\u201d", "Author": "arifofari", "ReviewID": "UR57595487", "Content": "Beautiful apartment hotel, modern and sophisticated and really close to all the main sites of Rome.
