{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Someone please give the breakfast staff some training! Different people value different aspects of a hotel when they travel, so I\u9225\u6a92l just list what I liked and what I didn\u9225\u6a9b. Then you can see whether there\u9225\u6a9a stuff that will bug you out, or stuff that you just simply don\u9225\u6a9b care about so this will be a great hotel for you.The pluses for me:The room was one of the most quiet I\u9225\u6a9de ever stayed in, anywhere in the world. What bliss to NOT hear slamming doors, noisy neighbors, TVs, and cleaning staff shouting at each other in the hallways.Found the ironing board and iron very useful for last minute touch ups.The shower was hot and powerful.Hair dryer was excellent as well, I hate those weird contraptions that are stuck to the wall, and emit the weakest lukewarm air. This is the type of powerful hair dryer I\u9225\u6a87 use at home.The room had very clever use of space. It wasn\u9225\u6a9b a very large room, but the designers made it feel airy and comfortable.Plugged my Sony Ericsson Walkman phone straight into a jack, so could listen to all my own music through the TV. Excellent.I didn\u9225\u6a9b find the location that much of a problem. I prefer to be away from the touristiest areas anyway.Bellboys were friendly and efficient, especially one guy from the Philippines on the morning we were leaving.The minuses for me:Each light switch came with this really bright diode that stayed on at night. Someone had drawn black marker all over it, so I assume it bothered other people at night too. It was so bright that in the end we ended up sleeping with the blinds up, so as to not notice the tiny pinpricks of light that somehow managed to light up the whole room.They only change linens on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, unless they\u9225\u6a99e \u9225\u6e1foiled\u9225? There was a sign to that effect by the door. Many hotels have a cardboard or plastic sign that you put on the bed if you want your linens changed, but this is the first time that I\u9225\u6a9de seen a hotel have this sort of set arrangement in place. I\u9225\u6a93 not a neat freak or anything, we\u9225\u6a99e staying in a hotel in Taipei right now, and we only request that the maids change the linens once every three or four days, depending on how we feel. I just think that it would have been nicer if the choice had been left to the guest, rather than the hotel.The worst thing for me was the service at breakfast. Waiters were trying to take our plates whilst we were still eating, and took plates away even when we were still using them. We didn\u9225\u6a9b even eat that much or take that long, but it felt like they just wouldn\u9225\u6a9b leave us alone! I thought it was just bad luck on our part, but we saw this poor business guy having to shout at a waiter, \u9225\u6dda ALREADY told your colleague TWICE what my room number is!\u9225?The breakfast staff were very intrusive and in your face, and I found this to be an annoying way to start the day. And although I normally never have the buffet breakfasts because I tend to eat very little in the morning, I still thought that the spreads should have been more generous and refilled more often. How ironic that had they not upgraded us, we wouldn\u9225\u6a9b even have gone to the buffet breakfast!All in all, I\u9225\u6a87 probably stay here again, but would skip the harassment that breakfast turned out to be. Oh, and I was going to write all these comments down onto the comment card, but when I had left the hotel I noticed that the guest comment card wasn\u9225\u6a9b even pre-paid. I was about to go to the airport and had too much stuff to do to go hunt down a post office in all the rush, so I never did it.", "Date": "Dec 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR536237844", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "cat666"}, {"Content": "Good stay at the Hotel Jen I stayed at the Hotel Jen while in Hong Kong to attend a family wedding.

Was given a very good rate hence decided to give the hotel a try. Initially concerned about the location as there's no MTR station within sight, but alas my fears were unfounded! Hotel Jen is located in a smashing neighbourhood full of local eateries and McD and KFC and even a wet market nearby! Best of all, its only 10 mins by bus to Central for everything posh and luxurious! Hotel has everything I need without being OTT. Luxurious bedding, free wifi (which is EXTREMELY IMPT IMO), dvd player, decent restaurant, fantastic seaview (ok not the pretty harbour who cares), pool and a gym, which is extremely rare for mid-range HK hotels. The hotel also has in place plenty of green features such as electricity auto switch off once key card is removed from slot.My only gripe is the Jen Lounge which although is pretty, lacks in service. During both times I was there, the only staff on duty felt sloppy, and breakfast was simply not inviting. Croissants and other breads were cold and hard, so I suggest its wiser to eat at the cafe. The hotel also offers a hourly shuttle bus service (mornings and evenings only) to 6 locations, so you can conveniently use it for macau ferry transfer, mtr connection or even pick-up/drop off to HK station for mtr to the airport.

It is in amongst an older, working part of Hong Kong, which means the traveller sees a greater variety of life here compared to staying in a hotel in Central. Other reviews have covered the transport-into-Central bit, which is a positive attraction since it's quick and cheap but interesting. OK, so it's cheaper and not in Central - but is it naff? Not at all. The hotel has been plainly but tastefully decorated, is clean and has features such as top-floor bar, rooftop pool and gym. Having stayed in top business hotels in Central and Kowloon, I was really pleased with Jen as a choice for a family holiday. Coming down in the morning to a selection of local bakeries and fruit stalls (and yes, McD's too) is a heap better than another shiny mall. As you can see from the WEBsite, food is of course available at the hotel, although we didn't try it.

We found this hotel on wotif.com and benefited from the great, last-minute rates of offer at the time. We were a family of five and booked two Jen rooms. While we did not get interconnecting rooms, the rooms were next to each other which was very helpful with kids. The rooms were very modern with great facilities, although on the slighly small side. The entire hotel had a very modern look and feel. Our deal included free wi-fi, free breakfast, free cocktails from 6-8pm each night, 100 HKD of drinks from the min-bar each day, and ~600 HKD (for two rooms) of non-alcoholic drink vouchers to use over the course of our stay in the Level 28 bar or at the ground floor cafe. Some reviews I have read comment that the hotel is isolated - I guess it depends on your perspective. True, it is in the far west of the city near Kennedy so you wouldn't walk to the main shops but you can catch the tram (2 HKD to anywhere) one street away, the hotel shuttle bus (every 30 mins during the week), or taxis (30 HKD to Central, 40 HKD up the hill to LKF). And others may appreciate that this is one of few areas still retaining many of the older and more traditional flavours of Hong Kong in terms of the surrounding buildings and the businesses.Something to note for hayfever sufferers like us: our noses got going when we slept on the feather pillows and doonas. Unfortunately the hotel did not have any other options when we asked so we put up in silence after that. The only negative thing I have to say about our experience was that the hotel staff did not manage our expectations well at the beginning, and we got a little hot and bothered as a result. I put it down to our own tiredness and some lost-in-translation misfortune. When we arrived in Hong Kong around 8am, we contacted the hotel from the airport to confirm they had rooms available. They said yes and that they were available for us to use right away. Getting off a 16 hour travel leg with tired kids, that was very appealing. On that basis, we chose Hotel Jen over a couple of other options. Unfortunately, after arriving around 10am, our rooms did not become available until 2.45pm. We spent that time flopped on the lounges in the foyer / cafe. My pragmatic side acknowledged that with checkout at 12noon and check-in officially at 2pm we should have not been surprised, despite being mislead at the beginning. We weren't the only group to experience this when we arrived, and we saw others in a similar situation as we were leaving. I put it down to relatively weak English language skills from the front desk.", "Date": "Oct 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR687341759", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "DreamingOfTravelling"}, {"Content": "A work in progress Hotel Jen is definitely reasonably priced relative to other hotels in HK, and is an attractively modern hotel with clean bright rooms. However, it needs a lot of work in the customer service department before I'd stay there again.I paid extra for a Jen room with a harbour view but thought it was worthwhile -- the Jen rooms are located on higher floors of the hotel so there are better views, plus you have exclusive access to the 28th floor facilities: lounge where free breakfast is served and free happy hour drinks, plus 2 computers for free internet access. You also check in on the 28th floor -- which would have been useful to know before I waited in line in the lobby for twenty minutes. The lobby was utter madness when I arrived -- the front desk staff were rude and slow, and the guests around me were all complaining about lost reservations, mixed up rooms, etc. The 28th floor was a peaceful oasis by comparison. I should note that, apparently due to the madness in the lobby, none of my friends calling the hotel were able to reach me--the line just rang and rang and no one picked up.The first room I got was bright and clean with a decent view of the harbour. The front desk sent up a plate of fresh fruit, which was a nice gesture but the employee sent to deliver it just barged into my room--while I was in the shower! The room also smelled faintly of cigarette smoke, which I was willing to tolerate but when I got back to the hotel after dinner, the room was actually smoky--apparently smoke got into the room from a smoking floor via the a/c vents. The front desk was less than pleased to change my room when I asked to move, and took their time getting me a new room. The second room I got had a broken window shade so you couldn't even open up the curtain to see the view that I paid extra for, but it was smoke-less so I stayed. A major downside of the hotel is its location. There are no MTR stops nearby so you can either try and build your day around the limited schedule of the hotel's shuttle bus (it doesn't run at night) or just take taxis everywhere, which is what I ended up doing. I find the airport express to be the most convenient way to get from the airport to hotels in HK, but given Hotel Jen's location, I paid for a shuttlebus from the airport directly to the hotel rather than taking the airport express to Central and then another taxi.

It deserves a higher rank.I was in HK for a conference in HKU. On the plane, I saw the ad in the inflight magazine and thought: I wish I could stay there. The ad showed a baywindow with a cushion stretched the entire length of the window. It could be a third bed. And the window overlooked the harbour. As it turned out, I was booked by the conference organisers into the hotel. All hotel rooms could take some tips from this hotel. The entire room is divided into two parts--the sleeping/working area, and the toilet/shower/sink area. The way to imagine it is that one enters into the room via the toilet. Ok, that sounds crass but the toilet and shower are sealed off with frosted glass walls. When one steps out from the shower or the toilet, one is at the sink. Make a slight right and that is the door. Make a left and one is into the sleeping/working area.There is a review saying that one cannot divide the two areas. Well, this is a chi-chi kind of hotel There is what appears to be a very stylish wooden frame but actually it is a sliding door. In other words, the room can be divided into the sleeping/working area and the toilet/shower/sink area.The sleeping/working area is bright and airy with the window. It is a bit tight to be sure because one had to lie in bed to watch tv.The breakfast area is somewhat workmanlike. Besides chairs, there are stools. And the breakfast is not the lavish kind one sees in 5-star Asian hotels. But I'm not complaining.

The people who live nearby and work in the shops are very friendly.There is a Bank of China about four doors away. A great every day restaurant Tai-Saku about 10 doors down towards the water, which was frequented by locals, we had somewhat of a celebrity status after our 4th visit...great food for very little money.The housekeeper and the bellboy did a great job with our room and luggage. There is a shuttle bus which drops you off to the Macau ferry, Star Ferry, the bus/train station in Central and then on to Admiralty. We took two trips into China and did not worry about the extra time to get to the KCR In TST East, just enjoyed the Star ferry trip.There are still good bargains to be had at the lovely Stanley Market and the Lanes in Central.Victoria Peak is a must see as is Cafe Deco at the Peak and Simpatico, two good eateries. The taxis pull up at the front of the hotel and we used them many times, very cheap and convenient.I have recommened this hotel to my sister and her family who will be visiting Hk in Jan 2009. I would have no hesitation in returning to the Jen Hotel, it is a great value for money .", "Date": "Mar 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR127955140", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Chesterella"}, {"Content": "Funky contemporary designed hotel!

Also taxis are cheap and the tram about 100 metres away takes you downtown so location is not a problem.

For 20p you can get right to the other end of the harbour and you get to see the real Hong Kong.", "Date": "Feb 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR333214574", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lincolnandmills"}, {"Content": "Nice hotel - poor location Stayed in this hotel for two nights in January. The hotel is what you would expect from Novotel. We were upgraded to a Harbourview room which was nice and we did get a good deal from the Accor website. We chose the light breakfast option in the hotel lobby which is great if you just want pastries or toast and coffee.The only thing I could say anything negative about was the location. It's about a 15-20 minute walk to the nearest MTR station of Sheung Wan. The tram is about a block away but we didn't bother to use it as it always looked jam-packed. A taxi from Central MTR is around $30 HK ($5-6 Australian) so we either took a taxi or used the hotel's free shuttle service. If you intend to walk and use the MTR then I would stay in a more central hotel. However, if price is what guides your choice, then the Novotel is really reasonable for what you get.", "Date": "Jan 12, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR313095867", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "CuriousKaren"}, {"Content": "NIce Hotel   showReview(4230774, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 10, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR938341278", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "TSW42"}, {"Content": "Enjoyed this hotel   showReview(3779640, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 17, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR901101428", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Trav11"}, {"Content": "Enjoyed the Novotel   showReview(3651248, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 9, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR612546019", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lzb"}, {"Content": "somewhere different next time   showReview(3538263, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 7, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR969728033", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "matthew"}, {"Content": "Location:out the way   showReview(3492529, 'full');", "Date": "May 22, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR860367019", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "dior_crazy"}, {"Content": "Not a bad hotel at all!   showReview(2490977, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 24, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR373091803", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Crazycat"}, {"Content": "\u9289\ue042\u5157\u9288\u6052\u5115\u9289\u6825\u5137\u9287\u0444\ue7fc\u9473\u754c\u6b91\u9287\ue042\u5127\u9289\u55d0\u5137   showReview(20753210, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR843362668", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289\u737cEN   showReview(19914896, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR986905887", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u7f0d\u6d2a\u7c35\u9287\u0441\u4eb0\u93b5\u5b28\u4ec8\u9288\u5d83\u4efe\u6e1a\u2103\u7278\u9287\u0441\u4ed0\u9287?#x201d;
