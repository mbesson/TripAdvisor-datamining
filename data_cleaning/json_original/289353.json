The hotel has a modern feel, is clean, and the staff are friendly. My room was well appointed,clean and nicely decorated. It overlooked the pool, which I did not use, nor do I think I would as it is heavily overlooked by apartments. Unfortunately, the comments on previous reviews regarding the air conditioning are true. My room was warm when I arrived, so I put on the air con and left. On return the room was warmer, as only warm air was being circulated by the air con. I mentioned this to the reception staff, who advised that this was due to it being winter, and provided complimentary water. The hotel is not within walking distance of the centre for sight seeing. I had a bit of time to kill, so took the metro to the centre, and the bus back. The hotel staff were helpful with this, and supplied a map. If you like shopping it is conveniently located for the best shops in town. The breakfast was ok, nothing special, and the hotel does not have a restaurant although there is one next door, however as the hotel is located out of the centre, the restaurant did give the feel, that it was used to serving locals rather than visitors. Overall the hotel is ok, but if I return to Barcelona as a tourist I would choose somewhere closer to the centre, with better/more facilities.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in a great location\u201d", "Author": "Emma853536", "ReviewID": "UR125740694", "Content": "We stayed for 3nights and had a lovely time!

However, I took confidence in their Small Luxury Hotels affiliation and took the plunge. I am really happy that I did, because the Gran Derby turned out to be really nice. It also helped that I was upgraded to a Deluxe room upon my arrival. The room was clean, modern and good sized, separate lounge area with sofa and table, huge closet and great bathroom with both shower and bath. My best impression however was from the staff, always helpful on any request, especially the lady at breakfast, who kept offering more coffee or new pastries. Speaking of which, breakfast was high quality continental option, with real fresh fruit, great ham and Spanish cheeses (including manchego) and assorted pastries. Best of all, lattes and expressos made to order, not that weak filter coffees in many hotels. The only downside was that (possibly my fault, as I didn't ask) the room was a bit warm. In fact, it was warmer than usual for this time of the year, so in most places (like the common areas in the hotel), the heater would be on and you'd feel warm. After trying without success to adjust what I thought was the air conditioner, I resorted to opening the windows as I would come back at night. It only worked for a while though, as the room faced the street and you could not bear the noise and sleep with it open. The good thing about this being out of the beaten track is that this is a quieter location. The local bar and restaurant nearby are neighborhood spots, hence close at a decent hour. The gentlemen clubs nearby are a non issue, as they are closed venues and there is no soliciting outside of any sort. The residual noise during the night was on and off traffic at nearby Sarria avenue, which you probably won't get in a room not facing the street. All in all, this is a very good hotel a bit way from the main touristy spot of the Catalunya square, which it compensates with lower rates and a wide array of dining options nearby. Get yourself a Barcelona transport card and you'll be fine here.

My main concern is the cost of staying there, you would think for paying over 1000 euros for 4 nights you would expect a great hotel and 4 star luxury but this was just not evident. The pool for example is more like a paddling pool - the water came up to my knees and and i could nearly stretch from side to another. We had a sound proof room but i dont quite know what is was sound proof from as our neighbour showered around about 6am in the morning and the noise was so loud it felt like i was in the shower with them. They gym had a running machine, an excecise bike, limited weights and and a sit up bench. The treadmill either was not working properly or had some kind of limiter on it as at top speed on the machine i think a baby could crawl faster. The excerise bike didnt work properly and all looked slightly dated. We then thought lets forget the gym and go to the sauna. This took over an hour to get a sweat on to the point we nearly gave up in there. They did give us a complimentary bottle of wine on arrival which is a nice touch but no water, no kettle, no iron, no music system and the televison only had bbc worldwide news and CNN as their English channels. I would stay here again but at half the price and would classify this as a good 3 star and not a 4 star as advertised.

On my first morning we popped down to breakfast for about 45mins and I left my bag in the room...to be honest I didn't think that anyone would be cleaning the room so early. When we got back the door was closed but the room was being cleaned when we entered. I looked for my phone and it was in the inner pocket of my bag with the clear pouch of Euros I had picked up before I left England. The strange thing was that the inner pocket was zipped up - something I never do. But I could see my phone and wallet so I thought no more of it. I picked up my bag and we went to the pool for the rest of the day. Later that evening I went to split my money up so that I wasn't carrying all of it out with me. That is when I noticed that 100Euros was missing. It was very clear that it had not been a mistake on my part as I hadn't spent any money until then - having only arrived the night before. I came with 300Euros which I had counted at the foreign exchange...and there was only 200Euros in my wallet. I have never had anything stolen from me in my life and would never say anything unless I was ABSOLUTELY sure there was no other explanation. So, I spoke to the man at reception and explained that I thought money had been taken from the room. Basically the long and short of it is that I ended up speaking with three different staff and some were particularly accusing in their attitude towards me - not great when you've been robbed. They checked the room door records and there was one maid who entered that day. They said that she had been there for years and that she was an exemplary staff member. They put some fruit in our room as a token but did nothing else to acknowledge the experience we had. I ended up going to the police and filing a report but this was just for insurance purposes - although I couldn't claim anyway because the excess was higher than the amount stolen. Part of me admires the fact that they stood by their staff. However, 100Euros was definitely taken from my bag whilst I was at breakfast and the staff were not particularly empathetic to this situation. i would recommend you keep you money on you at all times...and if you do leave it for even ten mins - check the amount when you return. Perhaps this has been going on for a long time and no one has noticed because the full amount is not being taken.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kildare", "Title": "\u201cNice & relaxed\u201d", "Author": "Dollos", "ReviewID": "UR117902635", "Content": "Had a nice and relaxed five nights in the Gran Derby in Barcelona.

We thought the price was reasonable considering some of the prices of other hotels in Barcelona. I was a bit concerned before arriving due to some of the reviews I had read...but was relieved when I got there. I wouldnt say it was totally up to 4 star standards but I was acceptable. I was slight confused when I got there - the hotel seems to be linked to another hotel across the road. I never really got to the bottom of this but I think the restaurant, bar etc is in the hotel across the street. This I wasnt really keen on but we ended up on the la Rambla every evening so it didnt really matter in the end. Our first room was one of the duplex suites - I have to admit I was slightly disappointed with it - the sofa was very worn out looking. The window looked out onto a small tunnel with other rooms facing directly onto it...it just wasnt great. However, like another reviewer we were given the option to upgrade. We were shown 2 different suites and were allowed to choose which one we wanted. We accepted the upgrade and it was 20 euros per night. The upgraded room was far nicer - there was a glass panel from the shower into the bathroom! There was loads of room, a big tv etc Finally I do have to admit that the hotel was quite far out from the city centre. Though we decided to buy a 2 day pass for the hop on hop off bus tour and there was a stop 5 mins away from the hotel so we used that to get about combined with taxis.

We booked it last minute and without doing much research ahead of time. When we arrived, we were told that the hotel has renovated many of its rooms, and that for 20 Euro more per night, we could have an upgraded room. We asked the man at the front desk to show us the non-upgraded room we had reserved as well as the upgraded room available for the additional fee. The upgraded room was amazing! Shiny hardwood floors, plasma television, separate living room with another television and sofa, sunk-in bath tub, animal-print accents, modern lighting fixtures, etc. All for just 20 Euro. We quickly agreed to stay in the upgraded room, since our total cost for the room per night was still only going to cost approximately 140 USD. What a steal for this nice of a room! We stayed in numerous hotels throughout Europe before we got to the Hotel Gran Derby and paid the same price, but got a lot less. The service at the hotel was also great. Every morning we ordered coffee with milk through room service. Our coffee also arrived within ten minutes and was absolutely delicious (and only cost about $10 USD with tip). Although the Hotel Gran Derby is located in a business district, a subway stop is only about a 10 minute walk from the hotel (the stop is Hospital Clinic). Once you get to the subway, you can go anywhere in Barcelona easily, including to the Las Ramblas. Thus, although there are certainly hotels that are more centrally located in Barcelona, you can't beat the value you get at the Hotel Gran Derby. Plus, on the walk to the subway, there are a couple excellent pastry shops which had some of the best sandwiches and treats I have ever had. This makes the walk to the subway something to look forward too :)", "Date": "March 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel, a bit off main sightseeing areas\u201d", "Author": "Stuggi", "ReviewID": "UR7594629", "Content": "The good news: hotel staff very friendly and helpful; rooms spacious, but not in a real 4 star shape anymore, lots of edges and corners better not to be looked at too carefully; I had a big living room and a separate sleeping room and bathroom upstairs; nice furniture, two tvs (who really needs that?), nice bathroom with stylish amenities; very nice breakfast, not too many choices but really beautifully set up. The bad news: no view out of the windows since the room was minus 0,5 levels from the ground floor (bedroom beeing plus 0,5 levels above the ground floor, but still facing a wall in 2 meters distance); metro stations at least 15 minutes walk, which is not too pleasant to walk in the middle of the night; tramstation nearby, but without connection to the center; neighborhood typical of spanish big cities, but not really a beauty.

After reading the earlier reviews I admit being sceptic, but we were pleasantly surprised. We were met outside by the bellboy who took care of our luggage. The receptionist offered to change our room, we where told and later shown that duplex rooms are on the backside of the hotel and on a lower level. We also had a look at one of the junior suites and two different types of superior rooms. The duplex and the junior suite were a bit gloomy. The newly refurbished superior rooms were both spacious and light. We ended up with a superior room that consisted of a living room connected to the bedroom with hallway that could be closed by a sliding door. The hallway also connected to the bathroom and a walk in closet with a safe and plenty space for suitcases etc. Bedroom faced out to the street. Air-condition only gave hot air during winter so we had to turn it of and air out trough the windows. Bathroom was well appointed. The water pressure was great and there were no lack of hot water. A huge showerhead so you really got wet, or if you rather would sink into the tub noting would stop you from that. The hotel also provided bathrobes, slippers huge soft towels ample assortment of bath products. Dark wooden floors made the room much cleaner. Reasonable prices in the mini-bar. There were flat screen TVs both in the living room (with DVD/DC player) and in the bedroom. From what I understood there are both cabled and wireless internet connections, as I didn\u2019t bring my laptop I would not know how well it works. We did not have breakfast included but there are plenty places for a breakfast just outside the hotel. The hotel is not directly in the city centre. You can walk witch is quite nice lots of shops and places to stop for a coffee. A taxi will set you roughly \u20ac5 back.

However, it quickly turned to regret as the days went by. The duplex room is dark, dingy, and extremely tiny! Be warned; if you are taller than 6 feet (or close) then your feet will hang off the end as we discovered on our first night. After a rough nights sleep thanks to constant banging, door slamming, and outside noise, we opted to upgrade to a room with a bigger bed. The superior suite is extremely stylish but no attention was paid to guest-friendliness or comfort. The bathroom taps are awkward to use, the square bath is not comfortable and the tap didn't work so I had to fill it up with the hand-held shower nozzle. No slip mats in the shower as I discoverd after using soap and the floor suddenly turned into a slippy-slide and I had to hang on for dear life or risk injury! The soap wasn't replaced daily either and foam bath bottles were left empty. There was alot of grime surrounding the basins and it was obvious the room hadn't been dusted in quite some time. The location of the hotel is not near anything. Metro station is a few blocks away. There is a 'Bus Turistic' stop but even that is a good twenty minute walk away. Room service is a disaster ! The staff refused to speak English and then hung up on us. We placed our order at 19h30 but was told it only opens at 8 p.m. despite the room service card (in clear print) stating the times for room service was from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. The televisions are not tuned, there are two english channels only, CNN and BBC, and there is no video-on-demand. Even the most limited service hotel offers video-on-demand. The lady who checked us in and the man who handled our upgrade were the only ones who could speak basic English. It made it terribly difficult to ask for anything or to get advice on the city. Breakfast is certainly not worth the fifteen euros (Plus taxes) charged. The food served is the same quality as a school canteen; watery, undercooked or overcooked, and powdery eggs, and dissapointing for a 4-star hotel. The pastries were at least nice. The breakfast lady didn't speak English so again it was difficult to giver her our order, which was brought to our table incorrect! On first impression one can certainly tell that alot of effort went into the decor and design of the rooms, pity that the same amount of effort wasn't spent on getting their staff and level of service as good.", "Date": "March 19, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Gran Derby", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d289353-Reviews-Hotel_Gran_Derby-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$115 - $214*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Loreto 28</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08029</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "289353", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/4b/08/d2/hotel-gran-derby-barcelona.jpg"}}
