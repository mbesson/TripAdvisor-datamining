Was very pleased with the LCD TV (decent range of channels) and the shower was hot every morning with power. The housekeeping was excellent. We used to go out early morning to see the sights and by the time we came back our room would have been cleaned with fresh bed sheets.I have given this hotel a 5-rating as it met up to all it's expectations. Breakfast in the morning consisted of cheese slices, feta cheese, fresh watermelon and tomatoes, apples, cereals, tea, coffee, orange juice and hard bread rolls as well as a range of spreads. We really enjoyed staying here as it was a nice quiet hotel, had good sleep, and location was spot on as we could walk everywhere. There was a McDonald and burger king down the road as well as a large range of restaurants. So this was very convenient. But what made this experience even better was the staff. They were very helpful and polite, and always ready to help us. Also gave us a lot of advice on how to get to places. And on our first morning there we missed the breakfast slot but they still directed us to a table and offered us juice etc. Would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a nice base to stay in to explore the city and good customer service. It's part of the yasmak hotels, and opposite to this hotel there was a hotel called romance hotel (which had a yasmak sign).

Centrally located between the sites in Sultanahmet (the mosques), Topkapi Palace, as well as Eminonu and the ferries. Also the tram stop is half a block away. Also, we were very wary about the many Istanbul hotels with reviews here that would have many posters with only one or two posts and only praising it, whereas this hotel has more reviews with varying experiences. We noticed that rooms that were not occupied would have their doors open for much of the day to air out. From the hallway I took a picture of a one queen or king bed room with a flat panel tv that was near ours...we wish we had this room! We are a couple-husband and wife. We heard that sometimes hotels will give you a hotel room with two beds instead of a shared bed if you are mixed-gender staying together, but I think it had more due to the fact that when booking via expedia there was no choice specifically, and it said 'double/twin' and we requested a one queen bed, but we ended up with a two twin bed hotel room. The shower showed some age, but worked well. The room was clean and always cleaned daily; towels were changed because the first day I noticed pen marks on one and the next day they were changed. Our experiences with the staff were nothing but fine. They were friendly during check-in, breakfast service, and housekeeping always greeted us whenever we passed each other by going in/out. Note: the free wi-fi worked great the entire time. We wanted to print our boarding passes however. So, we used the coin-op computer in the lobby. It needs 1 lira for each page, and 1 lira for each ten minutes use. It wouldn't print (we saw some other jobs in the print queue that obviously clogged the printer); the staff shut down the power and turned it back on and told us to put more coins in...but my husband explained it's not going to print at all and they refunded us the 4 lira we spent trying to get it to print--if it doesn't print once and you try to print again it only asks for more money. So, just check-in for your flight online and print your boarding passes at the airport which we did without any hassles! We opted for the free breakfast every morning and noticed many Turkish businessmen (they would sometimes converse with the staff) and a few tourists. It was never full in late May. The breakfast room seats 38 total with one table for two, and six tables seating six. The variety can be seen in the pics: feta cheese, sliced tomatoes, simit (pretzl bread), grain breads, plain breads, croissants, sliced cakes, sliced meat and cheese platter, olives, and choice of condiments (honey, apricot jam, nutella type spread, butter). We tend to eat the same type of breakfast at home, so we didn't mind the fact that the breakfast is the same daily. After all, it's complimentary, and there are plenty of people who'd love to have just a smidgen of their offering for nourishment. Expedia provided a $50 coupon off of our hotel reservation booking, and for the price we paid, we're quite happy with the hotel stay, even if we didn't have a nice queen bed room with a flat panel tv as we saw. We had a view of the terrace restaurant at the sister hotel Yasmak Hotel as well as of the Romance Hotel (another sister hotel), and could see the ferry and Bosphorus strait from one corner.", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGood base to see Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "fairymay7", "ReviewID": "UR65372813", "Content": "We went to Istanbul as for a short break.

We feel unfairly treated, the manager could at least have offered a complimentary meal, or a bottle of wine but he wasn't interested. So if you want to stay at this hotel, go ahead, but do not expect any free offers and do not be surprised if your taxi is not at the airport to meet you !", "Date": "May 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex", "Title": "\u201cQuite a pleasant stay.\u201d", "Author": "Kian_Essex", "ReviewID": "UR14786232", "Content": "First trip to Turkey & we stayed at the Olimpiyat Hotel for 7 nights. The hotel is nicely located between the golden horn & SultanAhmet. 10 mins walk to major sites like blue mosque, St Sofia, Tokapi Palace, spice bazaar, Sikeci station. Grand bazaar about 20 mins away. A lot of lovely eating places around, too many! One has to try their meat balls and grilled fishes, mouth-watering. Most hotel staff are courteus and friendly. Room tiny but newly renovated. I am happy to give 4 out of 5 for Olimpiyat Hotel.", "Date": "April 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester", "Title": "\u201cTiny rooms\u201d", "Author": "cazza50", "ReviewID": "UR13247620", "Content": "Hotel is in an excellent location for all main sightseeing attractions.
