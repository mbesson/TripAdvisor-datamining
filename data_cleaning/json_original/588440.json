Probably at the top end of 3 star hotels. Although we did stay in the newer superior rooms. The gardens and pool area are very well kept. Has a swim up bar, and the food and drink prices are very reasonable.The hotel itself mainly caters for domestic Indonesian tourists. There aren't many westerners staying here, so don't expect a party hotel. It is situated right across the road from the Kartika Paza Shopping Complex, and there is fairly easy access to the beach...about 10 mins.My only complaint was that the water pressure was a bit dodgey sometimes.Overall, I would highly recommend for the price, but don't stay here if you are looking to party.", "Date": "Nov 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR962316605", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "sventhor"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d588440-r13138529-Adhi_Jaya_Hotel-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "588440", "Price": "$61"}}
