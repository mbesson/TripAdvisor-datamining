They didn't know the hotel particularly well, but knew the location and strongly recommended it. Madrid is a relatively sprawling city, but with a relatively small 'mico centre.' This has got to be the best place to base yourself in the City, with access very easy (walking) access to main shopping areas, offbeat shopping areas and nightlight as well as the retiro etc. It is genuinely a superb base for a city break as it put you bang in the part of the city you want to be. The hotel itself is beautiful. Classic, but homely enough to still feel very boutique. You will find that alot of the 'classic' hotels in Madrid are on main road strips (say, the intercontinental) which are fine if you want to taxi everywhere but not if you don't. I found all of the staff here to be helpful and immediately wiling to assist which was great. I really enjoyed the hotel, and would definitely highly recommend it in madrid. For me personally, there are a few hotels in the top ten (for madrid) that I find amazing, but that's a personal opinion. If there was one criticism I had it would be that at breakfast the staff were clearly overwhelmed every day. saying that,when I decided I didn't want to wait for a table one morning the staff were very helpful is recommending a great place (literally across the street on the corner) which was excellent and is worth visiting in itself (think, walking back 50 years in time for some great coffee and churros). Anyway,I will be returning to this hotel on my next trip up to Madrid so am happy to recommend that anyone reading this does too.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, ON", "Title": "\u201cWhen they say 5-stars they actually mean every one of those stars\u201d", "Author": "TorontoTripper", "ReviewID": "UR126440914", "Content": "Our stay at Hotel Adler while in Madrid was one that enhanced the overall pleasure of our vacation there. Adler's a wonderfully appointed hotel retaining an old world charm. The attention lavished by the staff was genuine and made us feel comfortable since the moment we walked in the door. While not exactly in the 'heart of the tourist area', we couldn't have asked for a more convenient location. Situated beside 2 metro lines (less than 5 min walk to either of them) ... and yet quite walk-able to every one of the prominent sites; the restaurant, caf\u00e9s, bars and shopping near Adler make it a very convenient location. In truth, we'd rather stay in this location (than those that turn up in the heart of the 'tourist' area) away from the usual din of tourists and tourist-trap restaurants and souvenir stores - allowing us to unwind from our days spent exploring Madrid.

The staff members are all exceptionally friendly and helpful. They gave us great recommendations for restaurants and were very helpful with our sight seeing questions. They were always willing to hail us a cab (we often used the metro which is very very close to the hotel). We walked from El Prado to the hotel a few times by choice. That walk was approminately 20 minutes, but we also kept stopping to look around and take pictures of everything. Cabs are very easy to get near the hotel. There is never a shortage. Our room was cleaned twice per day and we were always satisfied with the quality of cleaning. The hotel has free wi-fi, but we did have trouble connecting now and then. Regardless, we got access to everything we needed! The hotel restaurant is also very good. I highly recommend Adler Hotel to all and I hope to be able to visit again! My only suggestions (which are separate and apart from the hotel, but probably apply for any international tourists visiting Madrid): If you don't need to check luggage on your flight to Madrid, don't do it. Barajas airport is very bad with luggage. They disregard \"priority\" tags. My husband and I waited- along with a crew member from our flight- for over an hour for our luggage to come out. When we asked about this, we were told it's completely normal to wait an hour or more to retrieve luggage from Barajas. And, they don't do overhead announcements at Barajas to let you know what's going on. Even airline crew members are subjected to this. Also, don't take a taxi from the airport unless you really need to. Taxis line up in front of the airport, so you have to take the cab that's first in line. Be very careful about getting a receipt and writing down all of the information about the cab (license plate number and cab number- which is inside the cab). In fact, tell the driver up front that you will be requesting a receipt upon your arrival. Maybe that will discourage a driver from taking you on a gypsy ride. You'll need a receipt later if you want to file a claim against the driver. A taxi should not cost any more than 30 Euros to get from Barajas into the city center. We ended up with a driver who restarted the meter during our trip and charged us 65 Euros. My husband speaks fluent Spanish and I had maps in my hand and was telling the driver exactly where we wanted to go. None of this discouraged him from ripping us off and proudly announcing \"there is too much traffic that way\". I later learned that the ride should have cost no more than 20 Euros at that time of day. And, to file a complaint, I would have needed a receipt from the driver. An Adler employee hailed a cab for us to get back to the airport for our departure. We arrived in about 20 minutes and paid 18 Euros.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGREAT HOTEL GREAT LOCAT\u0130ON\u201d", "Author": "travel_wisconsinmi", "ReviewID": "UR121650739", "Content": "had a fantastic stay at the Adler Hotel. the rooms are wonderfully modern and classy yet very cozy. the staff is awesome.thanks", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hilton Head, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, but not for tourists\u201d", "Author": "Lee1224", "ReviewID": "UR121282556", "Content": "This is a beautiful hotel located in the upscale shopping area of Madrid..Attentive Staff, Very Nice Rooms with all amenities..This hotel is attractive to Business People..we were the only tourists staying at hotel..location of hotel is far from tourist attractions..Great Hotel but would not recommend for first time touring of Madrid..", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hershey, PA", "Title": "\u201cIntimate, boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "gingerhshy", "ReviewID": "UR120781235", "Content": "We stayed at the Adler for four nights in early November while on a business trip.

On the plus side, the room was indeed very quiet as promised at check-in (there was construction on the sidewalk which exarcebated the traffic noise). Also on the plus side: the hotel staff was very courteous and arranged for a very early check-in for us, at no extra charge. Perhaps we should have asked to change room right away - trading off some noise for better light and at least some view.
