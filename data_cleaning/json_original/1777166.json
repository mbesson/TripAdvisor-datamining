Although, Expedia indicates that the hotel is in the \"Grand Bazaar\" area, after having visited Istanbul and now know the city a bit, that statement is a stretch. Yes, the hotel is located two or three tram stations away from it but is hardly super close as you might think. The hotel was fine-clean, decent room. As I was alone it was fine but for two people it would have been quite small. My main complaint is the area. The area according to my Turkish friends who live there is a bit rough. You probably won't get robbed or knifed late at night but as single woman, I didn't feel comfortable walking near there after 11 PM and was forced to take taxis which added to the cost considerably. My advice would be to pick a hote if you want to be in Sultanahmet which is much closer to the tram stops and where you'd feel better at night.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, Italy", "Title": "\u201ctilia hotel is very nice\u201d", "Author": "ronald w", "ReviewID": "UR117213923", "Content": "We stay 5 days in august 2011 . hotel have got very new rooms . accomodation is very relax. breakfast is good. espacially location is very very good. near by historic area and city center.this hotel staff very friendly. massage and sauna service is perfect ..", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIt was a pleasant stay, not excellent, but neither eventful\u201d", "Author": "186338Cris", "ReviewID": "UR116633984", "Content": "The hotel was fine overall, some small points left something to be desired though. The rooms are quite small, and ours, while having an excellent, up close view of a mosque, proved to be a nightmare during the night-early hours of the morning, when the sermon started in the mosque. Also, the cleaning part was more tidying up than cleaning, the towels and the bed-sheets weren't changed at all during our 7 night's stay. The breakfast was fine, plentiful, although a bit repetitive. The staff were nice, although their knowledge of English was dismal, very hard to make oneself understood.

It was one of the worst experiences I have had with a hotel: bad service, careless staff, bell men asking for money, not allowing bringing water to our rooms. We had to ask for everything including soap, pillows, blankets, our phone did not work, ... The only good thing was location even though they could not even tell us where to go for dinner!' There was no concierge, no bell man to carry our luggage unless we begged them to help and when they did they immediately asked for money! every morning, they ran out of eggs on the buffet, and immediately at 10AM they turned off the lights to kick us out of the breakfast room. Not my idea of a place where you relax and have a good time. You can get much better value for your money in the area. Believe me, DO NOT stay here. A nightmare of a hotel. At the end they overchraged us for Mini bar that we had not used!!!", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cDecent but Mismanaged\u201d", "Author": "kresnap", "ReviewID": "UR105129080", "Content": "We stayed in the hotel twice within a week's period - before & after our trip to another part of Turkey. LOCATION: The hotel is tucked away in a relatively quiet neighbourhood, away from the crowd and noise of the main street (we slept with the window open and the only \"disruption\" we had was the call of prayer). It is only a few minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk from the tram stations providing easy access to the other parts of the city. That said, there are dozens other hotels located closer to the tram stations (but obviously pricier) if you prefer so. ARRIVAL & BREAKFAST: On our first stay, the staff could not immediately locate our reservation although it got sorted out later and we were offered free breakfast for the first day and early check-in (at around 8 AM). We were also given a room with possibly the best view (towards a 16th-century mosque) on the 6th Floor. The breakfast buffet spread was acceptable, although fell short with any other four-star hotel we've stayed in other parts of the world. SERVICE: The service quality was rather hit-and-miss. Most of the staff do not speak English; some were friendly and welcoming, while some other did not even seem to be bothered and just wanted to get their jobs done. ROOMS: Both rooms we stayed in were clean and generally in a good condition and had a modern design, especially the bathroom. Unfortunately, in both occasions there were always big problems with the bathroom. During our first stay, there was a foul smell coming out from the toilet bowl (although we had not used it yet) and we had to open the window and pour all the shower gel and shampoo to get rid of it. In our second stay, the shower drainage was not working properly. Our first room had a fabulous view (see above) but was very, very small. Our second room had no view (facing the other side of the wall) but was significantly more spacious. OTHER FACILITIES: The hotel also has an in-house sauna, a Jacuzzi, and a hammam, but due to the inconsistent service we experienced, we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take the risk to try it although it was not that expensive. As in many other Istanbul hotels, free wi-fi was provided although we did not use it at all. VERDICT: The hotel is categorized as a 4-star hotel and could have been rightfully so. It was recently renovated and could have stood out among the other dated hotels in the area if only the management put a little bit more effort in delivering the service. Shamefully, they did not. We paid 60 Euros per night including breakfast (this is when similar, even smaller hotels charged at least 85 Euros) and spent most of our time venturing around the city so we did not really bother to make a fuss on the spot but had we paid more, we would have definitely felt cheated. We were not extremely upset, but we might consider paying more for a better quality lodging next time we are in Istanbul.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beirut, Lebanon", "Title": "\u201cvery good hotel helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "othmanli", "ReviewID": "UR100689903", "Content": "My brother and I got to Istanbul for 4 days 7 March 2011 to 10 March 2011.

I booked via Opodo.co.uk. A few points to summaries what I've found on the ground: Service: - Poor quality customer service. No courtesy, grim faces and reception didn't explain a thing on our arrival we have to ask for each and every basic thing, like confirming how many nights we are in, what time is breakfast and where...etc. - No one in reception speaks English. They just through random words at you and you have to pick up the keywords. There was a power cut and reception didn't know what I was talking about. God help you if you need anything urgently! - Staff complains why my 1 year old daughter left the baby chair with breadcrumbs and bit of boiled eggs - they can't be bothered to clean. - I've asked for a plat and fork from reception/room service and I was told it's \"forbidden\". Didn't explain why. Room: - Room never hovered for the 5 nights during our stay - Very small rooms, byt European standard. Barely fits a double bed. - They don't have baby beds or cots, so be aware if you are travelling with children. Most hotel booking websites say they do (Opodo, Booking.com), but they don't. Breakfast: Very poor; bread, olives, juice from bad quality concentrated liquid, and 8 types of cheese. Ah, the coffee is served from a knackered automated machine and it sucks. The worst I've had in a while. Location: - Narrow back street that you wouldn't expect a hotel to be in. The area is full of wholesale merchants of Turkish products, rather than for tourists. - 4 Taxis failed to find this hotel. From the one we took from the airport to the local ones. - 10-15 minutes walk from main attractions. My advise is to book with a hotel in Fatih area. At least you can save 50% on the price of bus shuttle to the airport vs taking a taxi. Overall: Saying the 4 stars rating on the hotel description and business card is a joke. It should be rated as one star max. If you are heading to Istanbul anytime soon, I subject you consider another hotel.", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery new, very nice\u201d", "Author": "StephenII", "ReviewID": "UR86601032", "Content": "Great hotel in good area next to Sultanahmet.
