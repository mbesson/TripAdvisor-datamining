It was the worst travel experience of my lifetime. What disturbed me more was that I tried to contact the city of Chicago housing offices to report the situation, and no one seemed to want to be involved. Down the hall from my room a group of drunks appeared to be having a 24 hour party with the door open. The title \"Hotel\" is misleading...

I stayed in one of their overnight rooms, which had double bed, air conditioning, TV, and phone. These rent for $75/night. They also have rooms on a weekly or monthly basis, but these rooms lack TV and air conditioning. At $170-213/ week, they are a good deal, if you bring a fan.

We did not book a room before we arrived, but happened to find 2 available rooms here, at a much better price than the Days Inn down the street. The ladies behind the desk chatted with us and were very patient with my worn out credit card. Aside from being required to rent 2 rooms for the 4 of us (we absolutely could not have more than 2 people per room) the location was excellent. The parade went right in front of the building on W. Diversey, and the religious protesters were right across the street, making it more interesting. Close to gay bars on Halsted, Duffy's bar is right next door, Chipmunks restaurant (pizza, gyros), Walgreens, liquor store is very close (cheap beer, expensive cigarrettes), and 5 minute walk from Subway restaurant and transit lines. The rooms were clean and all of the fixtures worked. They were nothing special- just a bed, a chair, dresser, TV, and bathroom with bath/shower. They weren't too small and each has own bathroom. No bugs. Nothing was stolen from the room. All in all a good experience.

Needing a place to stay while I waited for a job interview, I had intended to stay here for several weeks. I splurged on the 2-room suite, with refrigerator and microwave, since I could then save some money on food. On the second day of my stay, the refrigerator door came off. Apparently, it was attached only by the top hinge, the bottom one being already off. When I reported this to the desk clerk, I was told it would be repaired. The next day, the manager accused me of vandalism and threatened to make me pay for the repairs. No repairs were made and when I checked out at the end of the week, I was again verbally abused by the manager and officially 'banned' from the premises. The rest of the staff - desk and housekeeping - are extremely courteous and professional. But the manager seems to have the policy 'you break it, you buy it.'

Based on the reviews above (Oct 16, 2002 + Oct 17, 2003) I went to view the available rooms at the Belair. Boy was I disappointed even though I consider my standards quite modest. They give you a key and you go up and check out the room(s) M-F 12-8 Sa 9-8. The room I saw was old and while it seemed somewhat clean it just had an overall look of dingy, dingy, dingy. It was one of the majority of rooms that are rented by the week/month. They have some few other rooms that rent by the night and possibly might be different. The room rate was $159/wk. At $259-299/wk the Chicago area Ext Stay America properties seem to me to have a vastly better bang per buck ratio.
