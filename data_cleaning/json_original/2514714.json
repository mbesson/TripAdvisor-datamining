The hallways (not the rooms) smell like curry, but they are in Curry Hill so I was not surprised. The best part of this hotel is the location. It is central to everything, and literally 1/2 block away from the 6 subway, which will take you to grand central or lower Manhattan to transfer easily. There are several places to eat and drink that are very close. If you like to walk, it is not too far to the TS/ Central Park area. I'm a mega-walker, so I spent almost all of my time on foot and had no problems getting around, and I saw so much more of the city. The staff at Park South were super. The front desk and door staff are lovely. Housekeeping was efficient and polite. The concierges that bring ice and room service are awesome. I was very impressed. NYC can be a stressful town, especially when you are trying to get work done. The Park South was a nice place to stay and accommodated my needs nicely.

This was a short break to celebrate the birthdays of my wife and daughter. We stayed in 2 Executive King rooms, which were spacious and spotlessly clean. The large beds were very comfortable. The hotel has retained much of it's original character and charm, unlike many of the alternative corporate style hotels that we could have stayed at. There is a small business room in the basement and you can use the computers and printers free of charge. The hotel staff were all polite and helpful with any questions that we had, including the owner, who was only too pleased to assist when I ran out of printer ink. Breakfast was served in the adjoining Black Duck Restaurant, which is very pleasant. The breakfast is included in the rate, and is of a good standard with plenty of choice for a continental style. We had dinner at The Black Duck on our last night, and enjoyed it immensely. My wife and daughter had the duck and I had the pan fried chicken. The portion sizes were generous and the quality of the food would have been difficult to find at that price in the U.K. The service was polite and discrete. The hotel is situated near the middle of Manhattan, in a mixed commercial/residential district and you can easily reach all of the main tourist sights. Whilst the subway is further down the street, we used taxi's for convenience as the cost over a few days was well worthwhile. The Empire State Building is literally a few minutes walk away, and on the clear day we visited the views were breathtaking.

From the time I called the hotel to make the reservations to the time we left - I enjoyed courteous, professional customer service. The hotel has a fitness center in the basement. Although not large, it was more than adequate and my daughter and I were happy to have it so conveniently located. There were sanitizing wipes for the equipment available as well as extra towels and a water cooler. It had an iFit compatible treadmill, bike and elliptical as well as a bench and free weights. The complimentary breakfast was quite good. There was a selection of pastries, breads and cereals, as well as fruits and boiled eggs. Juice, coffee and an assortment of teas was also available. My only complaint would be that the tablecloths at breakfast would get soiled between diners and were not always changed. I would think it better to remove the cloths altogether. Loved the location - the subway 6/green line was literally steps away from the hotel - just two stops from Grand Central Terminal - which made getting to just about any part of the city quite easy. The staff arranged for a car to take us to the airport - it worked out perfectly - a beautiful, clean car and friendly, professional driver. My daughter and I love NYC and plan on returning - we will definitely consider staying at the Park South Hotel again.

For whatever reason, we consistently had 3 sets of towels with 4 of us staying. A little frustrating but everytime we asked for more, someone was at the door in less than 5 minutes. The breakfast was a good selection, but the dining room is small and if we went down later (9am-10am) there could be a pretty good line up of people waiting for a table. Sometimes we just zipped in, grabbed what we wanted and ate in the room. The staff were helpful and friendly. The location overall was decent as we were literally 10 steps away from the metro - green line. We walked to the Empire State building in 10-15 minutes and a cab ride in the evenings back to the hotel from wherever we were usually cost about $10.

We stayed at the Park South after a little investigation into reasonably priced and located small hotels in the city, which we eventually booked as a package with flights through BA. The location, although a little further out than some, is good and quiter than the more central midtown hotels; if you're prepared to walk or happy to get the subway then it's fine. If not then don't bother with this location. Our room was a standard queen and I didn't have any really high expectations, however tea/coffee making facilities in the room I did expect, particularly when any refreshments in the hotel were purely reliant upon the Black Duck Restaurant! The room was small with a lousy outlook but as with most visitors to NYC you are not there to sit in your room so we were happy with that. The bathroom was small but enough for myself and my daughter. The room and the bathroom were very clean with clean towels provided each day with a top up offered in the evening by house keeping along with a chocolate; nice little touch. We met 3 different doormen who all were very nice, polite and helpful. The desk staff in the main were pleasant and helpful but a couple of them seemed as though it was a little too much trouble to speak to you and had a very disinterested air. The breakfast provided in the Black Duck was good, and although the same everyday it was enough to kick start the day, particularly in a city where food is on every corner making one choice quite difficult! We ate in the restaurant on Christmas Eve as we were particularly tired from the previous days travelling and the days sight seeing so not up for doing much that evening. What I can say is that the food was OK, the menu is limited and I just felt that they were trying too hard to be something they are not. I also got the impression that as we were hotel visitors, we weren't terribly important and they were busy flitting round making sure everything was set-up for the evening for walk-in visitors. Our service that evening was provided by the barman; nice guy, typical friendly/approachable barman type. The other staff in the restaurant were non-descript with an air of over importance that I did not warm to. All in all I was disappointed as the reviews I read before eating here were good but the food was OK, nothing to write home about. I've eaten much better in a number of local UK Home Counties gastro style pubs and country wine bars. One of my biggest complaints is that the hotel does not have a nice comfortable central lounge just to grab a coffee and unwind a little after a day sight seeing and shopping before getting ready to go out again in the evening. Instead it just has a lobby with two sofas and the reception desk with refreshments only available after 5pm from the Black Duck or a local Starbucks. Also, if you stay on the 6th floor, watch out for the strong smell of curry in the mornings in the corridors to the lifts. This can only come from the Copper Chimney next door!

Room was a little disappointing. Sold as a superior triple but I couldn't see what made it a superior room. The carpet was rather old and had a large stain in the doorway and the decor was rather dated. The room had two double beds but was only set up for two adults - not enough hand towels for three people, only two tumblers in the bathroom, not enough toiletries for three people. Some nice touches though such as clock radio, fridge, bathrobe (but only one!) so maybe these were extras that made it a superior room? However, the room and bathroom were clean as were the bedding and towels. The shower in the bathroom was very powerful and always plenty of hot water. The room was at the back of the hotel so was extremely quiet. There was no road noise whatsoever and I never heard any noise from other guests at all - no doors slamming, no talking, no plumbing noises. The only noise was that of the air con units outside but that wasn't overly loud. I couldn't believe that we could be in mid-town Manhattan and not hear anything! The location is good for reaching lower Manhattan and areas such as Empire State Building and Macy's. A bit of a trek to the more popular areas such as around Central Park and Broadway but walkable. There was a subway station just a few hundred yards from the hotel though I never used it. The hotel amenities are good - gym, restaurant, business centre, luggage store room. The staf were extremely friendly and helpful - particularly the doorman who organised a return car to the airport for us. We booked it for 3pm but when we returned at 2.30pm the car was already there waiting with our luggage loaded. It was a plush car but only cost $10 more than the yellow cab we took from JFK to the hotel. Breakfast was just continental but there was a toaster. Good selection of breads/muffins/bagels and various danish pastries, fresh fruit, cold meats and cheeses, boiled eggs, cereal, yogurt, juice, tea and coffee. Everything was replenished regularly. As breakfast was included in the rate, I think what was provided was excellent and of a good quality. This was my third trip to NY and I have always stayed further uptown (45th St, etc). Personally if I were to go again I would prefer to stay more uptown again though I would never be able to find such a quiet hotel.

I only stayed one night, but this was enough to experience some nice hospitality from the many staff who work there. So, why all the positive comments? Well, for me it offers a great package at a competitive price, and has some nice touches which enable it to stand out from other hotels in its price range, and even surpasses the services offered at some hotels in higher price brackets. The room I was allocated was a double double (room 821) which had a desk and chair, but no lounge chairs in what was a narrow room. The bed was comfy, and the decor is classic but not old fashioned. Unfortunately this room did not have a great view (not an issue for me), and was a little dark, with only 3 lights in the room, a ceiling light by the door, the desk lamp, and the bedside lamp. There is a safe in the wardrobe, empty fridge and ironing facilities if required. There was also a DVD player, a feature you rarely see in hotels. The air conditioning was effective, however, it is an old style system which was a bit on the noisy side, but at least you can control the settings. The bathroom was compact and clean, although some might find the sink small. The amenities included soap, body gel, shampoo, conditioner, lotion and hairdryer. Another feature you usually only see in upgraded rooms is a bathrobe. Whilst other places continue to charge for internet connection, this place offers free internet, both wired and wifi, as well as a business centre with free printing (although the PCs were a bit slow). There is also a gym on site. The free continental breakfast was extensive and something I really valued as a business traveller, enabling me to save time wondering the streets for something to eat. A complimentary newspaper is also delivered to your door. There is one final touch to mention, which is a turndown service. I have never experienced this before as I never stay in high end places, and I was initially a bit freaked when I realised someone had been in my room. Upon returning to my room at night, the blind had been pulled down, bedside lamp turned on and chocolates placed on the bed. Now that is a wonderful and surprising touch for a hotel which is in the mid-range.

The hotel is on 28th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues. One can reach the hotel from Grand Central with a walk directly down Park Avenue. This will take you 10 to 15 minutes, depending on your pace. The lobby is modest, but the check-in was efficient, pleasant, and offered little Hershey bars. Two adjacent elevators serve the hotel and this arrangement is adequate for all but the most busy times. There is an eating area off the lobby that serves the buffet style breakfast that comes with the room charge. Breakfast has a good selection of items, cereals, fruit, yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, various danish, bagels, coffee (regular and decaf), and a selection of juices. Everything is simple and perfectly adequate. There is no limit and you can enjoy yourself. In the evening the same area becomes the Black Duck restaurant. I ate here one night, and had the duck. It was good, cooked right, and had plenty of flavor. I would rate the duck dinner as 8/10. Things are ordered one at a time, with the duck being about $25. Salad was extra, spinach, and also good but a bit routine, perhaps 6/20. Service was pleasant. It was a Tuesday night and no reservation was needed. There are two or three tables on the street, but most tables are inside. There is a bar that serves just about anything. The rooms are on the small side. Mine had a double bed, with about two feet to spare on each side, with perhaps 4 feet between the end of the bed and the wall. The bed was very comfortable and came with 4 regular pillows. A small desk was present with a good light with two intensities. There was a mini-fridge. The room had three small drawers and a half-closet - adequate to hang shirts or jackets, but a full length dress would have to be folded. There was no rack for a suitcase, but the top of the desk could be used. The bathroom was very clean and of good size and everything in there worked fine. There is air conditioning with two settings, two fan settings, and heat settings. It was 95 and humid most of the week and the air conditioner kept the room comfortable. It has the same problem many of these do - when the air conditioner cooling turns off, so does the fan so the noise level fluctuates. When the fan alone is on it is continuous. Internet is available.

The Park South had given us vouchers for a free glass of wine on check-in, so the total bill was only about $40/person. The atmosphere and service were excellent and the food (arugula salad, halibut, pompano, a fruit-topped cake dessert) was all good. Finally, I recommend investigating Kalustyan's around the corner from the hotel at 123 Lexington if you're at all interested in exotic foods. The place is a real trip into the past with its endless shelves of spices and its two nice older gentlemen dispensing Near Eastern delicacies like mujadarrah (a lentil dish) in the upper-floor deli. As always, during this recent visit the Park South manager (Christiaan Aldoy), the assistant manager Diana, the regular doorman Chuck and his helper Jesus, and others such as Melvin and Shelley were all very helpful. It was reassuring to see so many of the same staff members who were there during my first visit three or four years ago . . . a good sign. To sum up:- the Park South is still my first choice for a comfortable, reasonably-priced stay in the city.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cConvenient location and good value\u201d", "Author": "Seagull70", "ReviewID": "UR102439775", "Content": "I have stayed here several times for business.

He was able to get a great deal on Travelzoo for a room at Park South, but I was unaware that he had called the hotel the day before we left to arrange for a complimentary upgrade. I loved the look of the hotel. It was built in the early 1900's so it had a lot of character and charm. It wasn't your typical chain, which we really liked. The room was large for NYC and had a view of the Chrysler Building. The bathroom was a little small, but that wasn't a problem. Loved the bath products and the room was very clean. Breakfast was included in the price of the room. It was served in the Black Duck Restaurant which was attached to the hotel. Breakfast included croissants, bagels, cheeses and meats, hard-boiled eggs, fruits and some of the best coffee I've ever had. A nice plus was that it was served until 11:00. We had a meal in the restaurant on Monday night and it was delicious. I had shrimp cocktail and the most delicious clam chowder and my husband had scallops. Yummy! Saturday night we listened to live jazz and enjoyed some drinks in the restaurant. We spent a lot of time there. Partly because it was so cold while we were in New York, but also because it was such a relaxing place to be. Everyone we came in contact with in the hotel was so nice and professional. The location was perfect. Right around the corner was a French restaurant, Les Halles owned by Anthony Bourdain. I got escargot and I do believe they were the best I've ever had. My husband had the steak, frites, and salad special. I had a bite of the steak and it melted in your mouth. Around the other corner from the hotel was another French restaurant, La Petite Auberge. We were a little disappointed in the food, but the chocolate mousse was to die for! All in all, this short vacation was one of the best ever. A big part of the reason why was because of our hotel. The best compliment to the hotel is that I'm planning a girl's trip to New York in October and I'm already making plans to stay at Park South. The thing about New York is that it is so addictive.

The rooms I've stayed in are 301, 521, 621, and a handicapped room looking out on 27th Street on a low floor, which we were upgraded to when the hotel wasn't full. The Park South is my first choice of hotel in New York City for the following reasons. 1. Value. I've always paid between $200 and $250 for a double-bedded room, a little less over Christmas. This is about the best you can do for a good hotel in New York City. There is a free breakfast, which is excellent (and very unusual in the city) that includes good cold cuts, bread, bagels, fruit, hardboiled eggs, juice, and coffee. There is also free Internet. 2. Location. It's half a block from the 6 (Lexington/Park Avenue) subway line, which isn't the best line, perhaps, but it's good for visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art and you can transfer at Grand Central-42nd Street to virtually all the other subway lines in the city. There are also MANY good restaurants within a block or two, including La Petite Auberge, an old-line French restaurant, and Dhaba, an Indian restaurant, both just around the corner at 116 and 108 Lexington Avenue respectively. There's a wine store across from those restaurants and another one on Madison and 28th Street. From some of the higher-floor hotel rooms on 28th Street there is even a view of the Chrysler Building. To the west, Madison Square Park with its greenery is very close at Madison and 26th. Taxis are very easy to get in this area (Flatiron or Murray Hill) as well. 3. Ambience. This is a smaller hotel with only eight floors and the service feels personalized. During my own stays I found an assistant manager named Diana to be especially helpful. The regular doorman (from the islands) is also great. The free breakfast is served in the hotel's charming Black Duck restaurant, which is on the ground floor and has large floor-to-ceiling windows open to 28th Street. It's nice to sit outside to have breakfast on warm mornings and equally nice to sit inside by the fireplace in chillier seasons. 4. Comfort. I've always found the beds to be extremely comfortable and have never been troubled by noise except in room 301, which is next to the elevator. In my experience, the rooms have always been kept very clean and the heating and cooling has been effective. (The windows open a few inches, which isn't always the case in the city, and it helps.) In the winter when the hotel wasn't full, we were even able to get a coffee-maker and a DVD player put in our room. There is a loft-like space above the lobby area that functions as a reading room and DVD lending library. That said, there are a few drawbacks that may bother some people and may account for the relatively low price of this hotel: 1. Many of the rooms are quite small and the ones around the central courtyard are also rather dark because they look out on other rooms in the hotel and don't have an open view. There is a lot of variation in room size even among rooms of the same price class, for example \"Executive.\" I would recommend asking to see alternate rooms if you are dissatisfied. It makes a big difference in comfort, for example, if you have adequate counter space in the bathroom to lay out your toiletries, and if you have adequate closet space to hang up your things. In general, the closets I have seen at the Park South have been quite small and most of the time you have to hang your clothes facing you rather than hanging at right angles to you as in a normal residential closet. 2. Also, the refrigerators in the rooms aren't really refrigerators. As the hotel's resident \"engineer' (a charming man from Montenegro) sheepishly admitted to me when I summoned him to my room, the condensers on the refrigerators have been disabled so the units are glorified iceboxes at best. The staff will deliver ice to your room, but the ice bucket is too large for the refrigerator door to close, so it sort of defeats the purpose. 3. The entry to the hotel is a bit of a challenge because people checking in have to navigate themselves and their luggage down three or four stairs to the lobby level and desk. I understand from the manager that a doorman is supposed to help with suitcases, and there is a mechanical lift, but in my experience sometimes the entry isn't manned. Not a serious problem, but I thought it should be mentioned. All in all, I think this is a wonderful hotel offering great value and a personable, helpful staff and I hope that it stays that way forever!", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA GREAT FIND\u201d", "Author": "GlasgowDavyMac", "ReviewID": "UR66253686", "Content": "First time in NYC, did not know what to expect but can honestly say we were delighted with this hotel.

If you are picky about your Hotels then this is not a good choice, specially for stays over a couple of days. We paid about $200/night during spring break. Hotel location was good in terms of underground and walking access to places of interest such as Times square, Soho, etc..however, the front view of the Hotel is a parking lot and the street is not that great. It's not a nice clean quiet street by any means. The standard rooms are VERY small with a alley/ wall view. The executive rooms are definitely larger but not huge. The largest and most expensive rooms face either the front street or the back. Both very noisy with traffic, trucks, garbage pick up, etc. The noise is buffered by a very loud air conditioning/heating unit when it works. We happen to be in New York during a hot spill and we suffered through 5 sleepless nights before the unit was fixed for our last two nights. The beds were not comfortable for me. I'm not sure why? Just not very comfortable so I woke up with back achs. The bathrooms are very small and our toilet over flooded twice..yucks. The breakfast was continental. Okay but not extra ordinary. We never ate at the hotel restaurant so can't comment. Nice Indian food around the hotel area, both fast food and sit down dinning. The desk people were simply okay. Not extreamly helpfull and nice and not really unfriendly. Just there. I'm not sure why I was set on this hotel. The website is somewhat deceiving. I guess I wanted the small intimate hotel experience but on 2nd thought I would have been better off with the Sheraton NY at a better price. I know I would have at least eliminated the noise and bed discomfort, and yes, the toilet mess. Having said all that, we didn't let the many negatives upset us.

Instead of venturing back out after a day in the city, it was a delightful treat to sit back and relax in a room that opened up to the street.

A small balcony, which extended over the lobby, provided an interesting assortment of hardback books to borrow or peruse. The desk staff was remarkably helpful, friendly, and witty. They recommended restaurants within walking distance of the hotel; they provided requested information about other nearby places as well.

After having stayed at the Grand Hyatt Hotel with huuuuge rooms at my last new York trip to NY, I was a little shocked about the room size of the Superior Room of the park South Hotel, but tiny rooms seem to be standard in New York. We had booked the Superior Room which seems to be the standard room. It had a queen bed and was big enough for the 2 of us and 2 big suitcases, even though there was not much or hardly any space left on the two sides of the bed then. The bed was comfy, not too soft luckily and big enough for two (standrad queen size). There were enough pillows and blankets. What bothered me most was the light in the room - it was far too dark. It had two bedside lamps - not very bright, a desk lamp and a lamp on the ceiling at the room entrance. there was no ceiling-lamp in the main room. The light was too dark for reading and made the room appear even narrower. We helped ourselves by turning the desk-lamp upside to the mirror so that there would be more light. The bathroom was bg enough with sanitaries such as shower gel, soap, etc. They didn't have a shower cap but I asked for one at the reception and got one immediately. Additonally there's a blow-dryer and a bathrobe and of course fresh towls. The light in the bathroom is a little too dark for putting on make-up, but well. The room also had a flat-screen TV and a fridge - not a minibar !!! The room was on the backside with view on a wall, but since we were on the 6th floor there was still enough light during daytime. The \"closet\" including the safe is in-built in the wall and very small! Walls are very thin too. The absolute positive thing about the Park South Hotel is that breakfest and wireless internet is included in the room-rate. Breakfest is available daily until 11.00am at the hotel-own restaurant \"The Black Duck\". The Breakfest buffet includes ham, turkey-breast, salami, several kinds of chees, bagles and other bread, cereals, fruit, yoghurt, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, juices, etc. We also had dinner at the Black Duck once. Food was excellent. The one waitress (who was luckily not assigned to our table) seemed totally uninterested in working though and wandered around with crossed arms and not one friendly smile. Pricing was ok for a \"better\" restaurant. The menu - including salad or soup of the day, a choice of 3 main dishes and a dessert cost 35 USD p.p. (not including drinks). There's also a gym and a business center at the hotel. The staff at the Park South Hotel was generally very friendly and helpful. Free newspapers were delivered to the room daily. The best about the hotel is the location. It's next to the subway station \"28th street\" of the 6 train. It's 6 blocks from 34th street where the Empire State Building, Macy's and plenty of other stores are located. It's 2 subway stations from Grand Central Station / 5th Ave. where you can also take the \"S\" shuttle to Times Square (or walk). It's also just 4 subway stations from Soho (Bleeker Street). Nearby to the hotel is a Duane Reade where you can get everything from drinks, snacks, magazines, sanitaries, drugs, etc. There is also a Starbucks just one block away, a McDonalds right at the subway station, a pizza place called California Pizza Kitchen 5mins away, etc. Generally I would recommened staying at the Park South Hotel and I would stay there again as an alternative to the Grand Hyatt (eventhough not comparable).

There were only two lamps in the room, and they were not very bright. Of course we didn't spend too much time in the room so this was just an inconvenience, not a major complaint. Our room did not have a full size closet but rather a combination half size closet and chest of drawers, but this wasn't a problem for me. Someone who packs a lot of dresses or skirts may have found this more of an issue. The room was always made up, and all supplies and towels were replenished regularly. There is evening turn down service, including chocolate on the pillows. The hotel is conveniently located near the 6 subway and is easily accessible to anywhere you want to go.

Note: this trip was me and my husband only, to celebrate our 16th wedding anniversary. We arrived about 3pm and were immediately checked in and informed we'd received a free upgrade from the Superior Queen room I'd booked to a junior suite with a king sized bed...yeah! So I cannot speak to the size of the superior queen, but this room was MORE than spacious, and had all the amenities we'd been expecting.

I'd asked for a late check out but they were full that evening and so could not accomodate us, however did stow our luggage so we could have 6 more hours of fun in the city, and recommended a great car service which we used , and I would highly recommend this route if you plan on transporting from the airport via cab anyway as its only a few dollars (literally) more and SO much nicer an experience.

Our main reason visiting NYC was for the shopping so we were looking for a clean, well-presented hotel in the hub of it. We got a lot more! The hotel was superb. It has an art deco style, large reception area with comfy sofa and chairs and a fitness room in the basement. Location is great too, about 10mins from the Empire State Building and the subway is approx 1 minute from the hotel, which goes both uptown, and downtown. We were fortunate to get upgraded on arrival and stayed in room 407 on the fourth floor. The room was very good; medium sized and nicely decorated. It also had super King size bed, large plasma TV on wall and a clean, modern bathroom. The hotel also provides you with a hairdryer, bath robe, ironing board, iron and coffee machine. There is a heater and air con unit under the window too. There were two downsides to our room. One, that we were facing the street so the view was semi-ok (car parking and front of hotel) but it was also very noisy, especially on the first night, which was a Saturday. The rest of the week was a little quieter. We decided to not ask to be moved though (more a case of having to re-pack then un-pack again). Secondly, there is a small Indian restaurant next to the hotel and as our room was on the street we could smell this some nights, as the window would not fully close. Again, we were just too lazy to switch rooms. (my partner would like me to point out that he couldn't smell anything though!!) One of the best things about the hotel is that breakfast is included in the price. There\u2019s a great selection of teas/coffees, muffins, croissants, bagels, fruit toast, yogurts, cereal and fresh fruit. We tended to pig out, as you then really don\u2019t need to eat until about 2pm! Breakfast is also served 7-11am, which is handy as you can have a lie-in still. The staffs in the hotel were very helpful too. We had a slight discrepancy with our bill but they resolved the issue quickly and efficiently. The doormen are also very polite and knowledgeable. Other things to know: Hotel is approx 30-45mins from Newark airport, depending on traffic. On a public holiday give yourself about 1-\u00bd hours though, just to be safe. The hotel also has a restaurant but the food is quite specialised and wasn\u2019t to our liking. The atmosphere is lovely though; one end of the restaurant has a log fire and armchairs, which is very cosy.

Anyway, we stayed in a double room as there were four of us - two couples. We manged it OK, but probably next time we would get two seperate rooms or find a hotel with a bigger size as we could hardly fit all four of our cases.

There were coat hooks behind the door and a small narrow half closet to hang shirts and below a set of narrow drawers for items. Also in-room safe. Comfy bed with down bedding and pillows, side lamps and a clock radio. My room was small, and no where to put luggage, should suggest to add a luggage rack/stand so it is not on the floor, otherwise, its all you really need in NYC. Provided breakfast, basic bread/toast, muffins, bagels, croissants, hard boiled eggs, cereal, fresh fruit, cereal bars, coffee/tea, etc. Staff was friendly and courteous, doormen were charming and the frond desk ladies were sweet. Good location, off of Park South near the # 6 subway line to uptown/downtown, lots of restaurants and takeout. Very safe area to be in. What i was very impressed with them, and if i could give them a 10+ is for their customer service. On our last day, we checked out, checked our bags with their storage and proceeded to do last minute shopping and sight seeing, had a great time cramming in the last bits, until we got to the subway to buy fare, i reach into my bag and my wallet, with EVERYTHING is gone. We raced back to our last purchase store, no luck, nice for them, we got to use their phone, but who do i call? I called the hotel for help/advice. They advised us to go to the police and file a claim. And allowed us to use their fax/phone numbers to receive any info regarding our situation. When we got back to the hotel, they received copies of our passport and social insurance cards, that we left at home, and had our family fax over to us. Allowed us to use their front desk phone to contact our travel insurance/ visa card to get some cash wired, and the hotel agreed to give a cash advance against our visa card that the agent had reissued for us. Also they helped us find a new flight to get home, considering during all this we missed our flight home. I believe they really went out of their way to help us any way they could, And we had already checked out, so really, we were no longer guests! Honest, decent, genuine, considerate, helpful people!

The AC is noisy but efficient. Breakfast is great, and we didn't have a problem getting a seat although the restaurant is small. The first time I stayed here my employer paid as I was on a work trip. The second time, I paid. The location (right in Murray Hill) does it for me, it's just great.

I like to try a different hotel (sometimes more than one) for each visit. Hotels have ranged from luxury--St. Regis (3 times), Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental, Pierre (while a Four Seasons), St. Regis Club at Essex House (while a Starwood), Peninsula--to \"chic/designer\"--Mercer, Chambers, City Club, Shoreham, Tribeca Grand--to \"good value and well reviewed\" --QT, Lucerne, Library. The Park South belongs in this last category. The hotel is located on E. 28th St. between Park and Lexington, an area I've never stayed in between Murray Hill and Gramercy Park. The Empire State Building is within walking distance. The subway stop for the 6 train is 1/2 block away on Park. Note: if returning to the hotel by subway, take the local 6 train only; the 4 and 5 express trains don't stop at 28th St. This area seems to have a large Indian population which is reflected in nearby shops and restaurants. A McDonalds and a Duane Reade drug store are on the same block. Note: Park and Lexington have some restaurants, but 3rd Ave. one block further east has many more. The front desk staff do everything--the usual front desk duties plus concierge duties, DVD check-out, room service orders from the adjacent Black Duck Restaurant. Everyone I encountered was competent but not particularly friendly. I was given a room on the top (8th) floor, and judging by the fire escape diagram on my door, it was the smallest. I was neither surprised nor upset, given that I was travelling solo for this trip and also booked through a discount website based in NYC (Quikbook). My room looked exactly like the photos posted by \"redhead 73\" on 3/28/06. My room was right behind the small elevators, but I heard no noise. Despite its size, the room was decently equipped--DVD player, small flat screen TV, fridge. The window was large enough and the space between buildings wide enough to let in a decent amount of daylight. The bathroom was tiny, had a shower only with weak water pressure, and the temperature of the water from the sink was highly variable. The closet was small--3/4 length with 3 drawers below. The rod was a foot long at most. There was no real space to store luggage. The previous guest seemed to have spilled beer on part of the mattress and carpet, as this area reeked and was damp. It took awhile and several attempts for housekeeping to address the issue, and the odor did not completely disappear. On the posivtive side, the hotel offers a car and driver (fees involved), free internet access (in room with your laptop or in the nice business center), a free DVD library, free newspapers (USA Today and NY Times but not Sundays), and a free expanded continental breakfast in the Black Duck restaurant. The breakfast is set up on the bar and offers a wide variety of carbs--toast, bagels, muffins, danish, croissant, cold cereal--and some protein--cold cuts, cheeses, hard boiled eggs. It is offered 7-11am and is always crowded. It was here I discovered that most of the other guests seemed to be European, taking advantage of the strong Euro and the August holiday. The restaurant is open for dinner nightly and did not seem crowded the times I peeked in. The menu is seafood oriented. I did have room service one night. The front desk took the order and a waiter delivered the tray, but without the usual room service amenities like salt, pepper, flower, water or bread. At least there was a napkin and the food was tasty.

It was the only place I could find for anything close to that price($200) and it met our needs nicely. As you approach the hotel, you have to come in off 28th Street. That might not be obvious given the name is \u201cPark South\u201d. It isn\u2019t really on Park Avenue at all. However, it\u2019s not hard to find. The area around the hotel isn\u2019t impressive, at least for a tourist such as myself. Compared with staying in midtown, there didn\u2019t seem to be a lot of activity in the area. There is a drugstore and a Mcdonalds on the corner. It's right next to the subway station, making transport very quick and painless. Check-in went smoothly and we got a room with two double beds. The room seemed fairly clean and was spacious. I had read complaints about a small room but we didn\u2019t find that to be the case at all. It was a nice place to rest up between site seeing. The bedding was very comfortable and adequate. No complaints about the bathroom either. Like I said earlier, this was a nice hotel and I really don\u2019t have a lot bad to say about it. If you are looking for a budget option that is relatively well-located (since it\u2019s right next to the Subway), I would certainly think this is a reasonable option. They serve a very good continental breakfast in the morning in the restaurant downstairs. They had some good pastries and a lot of fruit.

Having never been there before and therefore not knowing exactly what to expect, we did an awful lot of research to try to find the right place to stay. Even though we knew that most of our time was going to be spent sight seeing, we still wanted to stay somewhere spacious and comfortable. After having read an awful lot of hotel horror stories about tiny rooms, noisy locations, rodent infestations and worse, we opted for the Park South hotel which from all accounts seemed to be ideal. And we were not disappointed. The location is perfect for sight seeing with all the major attractions within walking distance. If you're not feeling too energetic, the subway station is about 100 yards down the road and cabs are easily hailed from Lexington or Park Avenue. There were a few street traders down the street from the hotel but we didn't notice any \"street walkers\" as another reviewer mentioned. The area felt very safe (safer than London in some respects) and it was also surprisingly clean. The hotel itself was modern, clean and comfortable. We had a room on the 7th floor at the back which although I was initially disappointed at not having a view of the Chrysler building - I was more grateful for the peace and quiet. New York is noisy and coming back to the tranquility of a quiet (and nicely air-conditioned) room after a day's sightseeing was a welcome relief. The room was enormous with a queen sized bed, armchair and still loads of room for our suitcases and shopping bags. It did lack a bit of hanging space as the wardrobe was bizarrely tiny but we managed. We had local newspapers delivered every morning which was a nice touch and also the complimentary breakfast was fantastic. Rather than the usual dried up croissant and wrinked apple you normally see, the hotel laid out a full buffet including every type of bagel you could imagine (watch out for the onion ones - not good for breakfast!). Good coffee too. The staff were very friendly but unobtrusive which was ideal - nothing worse than \"in your face\" service. If you needed anything they were there but you hardly saw them otherwise. We ate at the hotel restaurant, The Black Duck on just one evening which was very pleasant - the food was lovely and reasonably priced and the atmosphere relaxed. Apparently they also organise Jazz Sunday Brunches which, when we were there, appeared to have been brought forward a few hours to the Saturday night. We caught the tail end of it after a night out and had we wanted to develop hearing difficulties, we would have gone clubbing. Turn it down!

I was in town for the Subway Series and to visit friends, and as a former New Yorker I found this hotel to be an excellent jumping off point for my activities. Yes, there are prostitutes outside. Lest I thought I was mistaken the first night, they showed up again the next. But they would not serve as a deterrent to my recommendation, and indeed I have already booked another stay there next month. For the rate I got on a discount travel site, $244 per night for Thursday thru Saturday (a lot of places go up on the weekends, this one doesn't), I found the Park South to be a good value, compared with other NYC hotels I have stayed at during the last few years. First off, my plane didn't arrive at JFK until midnight, and I had no trouble with my room being held for late arrival. I checked in quickly around 1 a.m. and found the lights very dim in the lobby and candles flickering on the side tables. The desk clerk said that management likes it that way at night, but he did turn the lights up enough so that I could see what I was signing. I had a queen-sized bed, and true, while the room was typicaly NYC-small, with the obligatory view of the building next door, it wasn't as small as some I've encountered, where you could barely pass between the bed and the wall. The room was spotless, with two telephones, a TV-DVD combination, a Sony Dream Machine clock radio, a mini-fridge, safe, ironing board & iron, toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, shower gel & two sizes of soap), hair dryer and bathrobe. The latter is a great touch. The bathroom linens were thick and of a high quality. It was also very quiet, although the doors of the other rooms tend to slam, so that got to be annoying. There was a very small closet area with three or four drawers built-in below. If you're staying for more than a few days and want to hang up a lot of stuff it's not going to be sufficient. It was helpful, though, that there was also a coatrack by the front door. My room also had a desk with the second phone. In the morning I had both USA Today and the NY Times outside my door. I never ate at the continental breakfast, which is served in the Black Duck restaurant off the lobby, but I did stick my head in. It seemed to have a decent selection of fresh fruit, danish, breads, cereal, juice, coffee and tea. I stayed on the second floor, which held a darling alcove overlooking the lobby with two chairs and a lending library. There was also a selection of DVDs available to borrow at the front desk, along with an ever present huge bowl of Hershey's Minatures. I did use the business center, located on the lower lobby, which was convenient for printing out my boarding pass before my return flight. The only minor complaint I would have about that is that a staff member has to escort you and let you in, but I do believe it is open 24 hours. My first night back there was turndown service with two chocolates on the pillow, but for some reason that did not happen the next night. Housekeeping was a bit spotty in terms of resupplying towels and keeping them at the same amounts as there were upon check-in, but when I called down to say we'd been left no face cloths within five minutes there was a knock on my door with additional ones. The staff was friendly and helpful. Check-out was equally quick, although it took the bellhop a while to find the bags we had checked with him, and he actually had us come into the closet with him to find them. Overall, though, I was more than pleased and quite happy to find this place. It was very convenient to have the 6 train on the corner at Park Avenue, as well as a 24-hour Duane Reade (drugstore). There's also a 24-hour McDonald's, for those so inclined, and a nice bagel shop a couple of doors up, as well as a bodega on the corner of Lexington.

I told them that I left something and needed to go back up to quickly fetch it. The receptionist who had checked me out practically screamed at me \"What you mean you didn't clear out your stuff before check-out??? -- if you go back up housekeeping will be all over you!\" were there exact words.

If you are looking for somewhere merely to sleep and are not planning to spend too much time in your room then the size of the room is perfectly fine. The room was nicely decorated and the bed very comfy.

The hotel is well located in midtown, a 10 minute walk from the Empire State Building, with a subway station at the end of the block which we made great use of. I would definitely recommend use of the subway, it is cheap and very easy to use and saves a lot of time and energy, especially if you only have a few days in NYC. The only downside to the hotel was that the first room we had (can't remember the room number but it was on the same floor as the reception desk and quite near to the reception) was located right next to the generators so it was very noisy. I asked reception if we could move rooms but there were none available (we had arrived at 9.30pm and it was the last room left). However they did say that they would move us to a quieter room the next day and that they would move our bags if we left them in the room. I was a little sceptical but lo and behold the next day on returning to the hotel we had been moved to the same size room a couple of floors up. We could still here the generators but I'm guessing you could probably here them from most rooms anyway. So I was very impressed by this and generally the quality of the hotel for the price.

It was a last minute get away, and we wanted to be frugal in this very expensive city. That was my primary motivation behind my decision to book this hotel. We paid $185 a night which is extremely reasonable for Manhattan. After our stay at the Park South Hotel, I wish I had spent more money for a better hotel. The room was unbelievably small even for New York City. We peered around the room attempting to locate the closet, finally realizing there was none. We left most of our clothes in the suitcases and hung up what we were wearing that day on hooks extending from the wall. It was past midnight when we arrived after the usual New York airport delays, and both of us were a bit hungry. Knowing that we were in the city that never sleeps, we asked the person at the tiny front desk in the ersatz lobby what restaurant might be open at that hour, and he warmly and helpfully told us to walk down Third Avenue and see what was open. Thanks. Unfortunately, there was not one place serving food after 1:00 A.M. on a Friday night in this section of Manhattan. We eventually went to a 24 hour grocer and bought munchies to eat. Although the bathroom had a great shower with a \"rainfall\" shower head, it was miniscule with no place to put your toiletries. We also used our suitcases to store toilet articles. The bathroom was not particularly clean, and there were some frightening looking stains on the wall. The air-conditioning in the room worked when we first arrived, but it seemed as if the hotel decided to turn it off at night. Thus, the room was very uncomfortable to sleep in. Ambien did help us get some rest. We tried to use the work out room in the morning, only to discover it had only one treadmill, one step master, and one weight machine. My wife allowed me to usurp the treadmill, and I did work out. However, there was no air-conditioning in this basement room, and I almost passed out from heat exhaustion. On the positive side, the hotel restaurant was cute and had live music. The subway was a block away, and a visitor could get where they had to go quickly. However, if we were more inclined to take the time, my wife and I would have switched hotels. Yet, with three days in the city, we did not want to waste our holiday looking for another hotel. I cannot recommend the Park South Hotel. Bright colors, nice towels and a good shower head do not excuse ridiculously tiny rooms, no closets, lack of service, and a general grunginess.

I decided to leave and let my accounting dpeartment follow-up on the billing later. As I walked about two to three feet away from the front desk, the employee loudly said, \u201cStupid b*%^$^.\u201d I turned around, walked back to the desk, and said I was shocked by what I heard. I tried to maintain a calm demeanor, given this was in front of a crowded lobby of guests, and I was very embarrassed by the amount of attention. The employee said she was not talking to me and became belligerent. She repeated that she could say whatever she wanted as she was not speaking to me. Clearly, she was not in a good frame of mind and I insisted on speaking with the hotel manager. The hotel sales manager came to the front desk and made the situation more embarassing by standing next to the employee and asking what the problem was (again, in front of a large group of guests). She said she would handle the situation. I should add that the day prior to this, I asked to borrow an umbrella and was told to go the corner store and buy one. I will not be returning to the Park South Hotel.

First of all, don't be put off by the look of the lobby. It's rather depressing because of the lack of light and decor (definitely needs a remodeling). I highly recommend any of the rooms facing East 28th, floors 6 to 8. Be very specific and adamant in requesting a view room; I called twice prior to arrival and was willing to wait for an available room the day we arrived (they will hold your luggage until the room is ready). It's worth it-- we got a view of the Chrylser Building, room 707. It was a clean, very comfortable room with large windows, high ceilings and surprisingly quiet. Non-existant closet space so be prepared to store your suitcases in the room corners. Adequate bathroom with toiletries. Housekeeping services were erratic; one day we didn't receive bath towels, but a call down to the front desk quickly solved the problem. They have a strange turndown service time-- between 6:00 to 6:30, which I consider really early. If you ask them to return in say, 15 minutes, no one comes. Extremely slow elevators; there are 2 but they're small. Fantastic continental breakfast (bagels, pastries, cereals, etc.) in the room price; it's communal in the hotel restaurant (between 8:00-11:00).

This is excellent - huge choice of bread, d-i-y toast, bagels, English muffins, cereal, hardboiled eggs, cold meats, yoghurts and tea/coffee. The whole system was very 'laid back', so that although there was no coffee maker in the room it was easy to pop down and collect early morning tea/coffee in the takeaway cups provided, and return for breakfast later!

It is in a good location, easy to get around the city on foot from here. Go for a double double to get a bit of extra space. Room and bathroom very clean and well stocked with hairdryer, toiletries, bathrobe & plenty of towels. Breakfast was a help-yourself affair with oodles of cerals, bagals, toast, tea, coffee & juices.
