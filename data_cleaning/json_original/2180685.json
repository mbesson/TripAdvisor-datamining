The staff was extremely friendly and very professional;be it those at the front desk or those serving you breakfast on the terrace. The rooms were very clean and modern and apart from the small space that you get used to, they didn't lack anything in terms of comfort. We wanted some extra hangers and we had them within 5 mns. We had one light burnt out and again within 5 mns somebody was at the room changing it. You can tell that in this hotel they care to make their customer happy and to keep a very high standard. The last night we were surprised to find a plate of fresh fruit in our room for our breakfast since we had to leave very early at 3:30 AM and it was complimentory as well as our Turkish coffee that they did provide at 3:00 AM although the kitchen was closed. I would certainly recommend it to anybody visiting Istanbul and I would go back to it if I go back to Istanbul.

I noticed that reviewers were complaining about size of the rooms so I booked a double with balcony expecting a larger room and sent an e-mail right away to the hotel to ask them for a quite room in the upper floors. I also told them that as I'm suffering claustrophobia and ask them to avoid booking us a room with bed leaning against the wall (can absolutely not sleep facing the wall!!!). Hotel is brand new, open 4 months ago. Located in a street close to main Divan Yolu Caddesi (5 min. walk from \"Sultanhamet\" tram station. 5 min. walk from \"Cemberlitas\" tram station). 10min. walk from Aya Sofia, 5 min from Blue Mosque, 10min. from Grand Bazaar = Perfect location!!! We arrived at midnight due to delayed flight. We were first shown a extremely small room on 5th floor with bed leaning against the wall!!! I refused to stay and showed my booking to the bell boy and he immediately called reception saying that my booking was for a room w/balcony. I then spoke to the reception and they said that hotel was fully booked and no room with balcony available. He suggested us to check in in another room located on 3rd floor (302). This one was larger and after a quick look we decided to stay in this one. Reception offered to check with responsible the next morning to change room but we enjoyed our first night in that room so we kept it. The room had a nice overlooking to Aya Sofia! Good shower, nice toiletries (incl. toothbrushes, comb), bathrobe and slippers. Flat TV on the wall. Mini bar. Safe. No bed sheets but cotton blanket only (asked for an additional one). A/C was ok but we preferred sleeping with open window. The breakfast is served on the roof which is extremely pleasant but can be very hot due to lack of sunshades (25\u00c2\u00b0C at 9:00am)! Breakfast choice was about the same everyday but wasn't a problem for us. Depending on the time you will show up to take your breakfast, terrace might be crowded and no seats available (breakfast 7:30-10:00) but it only occured once (we took our breakfast between 8:45-9:30 almost everyday). The terrace is THE big asset of this hotel, the view is incredible and is perfect to relax after a long day of visits around the city. Staff was nice. All in all, I would recommend this hotel and would stay again.
