My bedroom was very good, but they may have been because it was on the exective floor. The swimming pool on the roof is tiny, and in need of some care; it's not a place to hangout. My opinion of this hotel was set from the off by the reception, the man checking me in had to refer every single simple question - \"is there broadband\" (no) ? \"is breakfast included\" (no) ? to the manager stood next to him, even though the manager was doing nothing he continued to ignore his floundering colleague and carried on playing on his computer. If I was more sure of the cultural rules I'd have probably have lost my temper with their behaviour, as it was a bit my lip and suffered in silence. Of the six of seven members of reception I dealt with over the two days, I would say only two of them know their jobs well enough. Best thing about this hotel is the night club on the first, not advertised at the front desk - I only found it by accident.

I took a taxi to a couple hotels, and found a room at the Holiday Inn. The location is fairly close to the airport, about a 7 minute drive. The hotel was fine, nice, clean, comfortable beds. I didn't walk around too much but the area seemed to be mostly offices and businesses. The next morning, I got up, took my luggage downstairs, and asked the doorman to get me a cab. I said I was just running across the street to the bank, and would be right back, When I got back, he had a towncar waiting for me. I told him I didn't want a towncar, just a taxi. He said it is a regular registered taxi, it was just a private one for hotel guests. Unfortunately, I should've insisted, but I as I was new to Dubai, I got in. Then the doorman got in.... the drivers seat. Yup, he was driving me! I asked again if this was a taxi and he said yes, same price as any other taxi. He drove me to the port, and the charge was about $60.US. Now, I wasn`t familiar with taxi charges in Dubai, nor the exchange rate on money, as I`d only been there a few hours. So I paid and went on my way. Only after did I realize how cheap taxis are in Dubai. If I was in a regular taxi, the whole trip would`ve cost me about $12US, not $60. I realize this is partially my fault, I should`ve prepared ahead of time to know the exchange rate, taxi rates, etc. However the doorman also clearly lied to me about the type of car and the rate he would charge. I imagine being close to the airport, the hotel gets a lot of travelers who are new to Dubai and you would think the hotel would be honest about these things.

My mother and I booked a holiday to Dubai, Greece, Croatia, Serbia, Austria and London. We went to our travel agent who organised all accommodation and flights. We settled on holiday inn downtown as being new to Dubai we didn't know what to expect and we knew that Holiday Inn was well known. We were a bit hesitant when we arrived at Dubai airport. Travelling 15 hours from Australia that is expected. We had our transfer pick us up from the airport and within 10 minutes we were at our hotel. The moment we stepped into the hotel we automatically felt relaxed and at ease. Our check in experience was fantastic and the staff greeted us graciously. The amount of respect and kindness the staff have for you is unbelievable. We felt as if we were special guests and not just a number like we usually are treated in most hotels. Joy, the gentleman that worked in the lobby was fantastic. He told us everything we needed to know about Dubai, the key places to visit, the key things to try and the key shopping areas to make the most of our stay. He was always so cheerful and helpful. He is really one of a kind. Breakfast at the hotel was exceptional. We met a lady by the name of Nilan who always made sure we had everything we needed without having to ask. She was also a very friendly woman, always happy. With an attitude like that it made us really look forward to breakfast and the day ahead. The cleanliness of the rooms were excellent and the temperature was excellent. The cleaners always asked us when we would like our room cleaned and catered to it as apposed to most hotels where they do it when its convenient for them. Mohammed the hotel security guard always made us feel safe and secure, we felt as if we could knowingly leave the hotel for hours and not have to worry about our things or anybody trespassing through the building. There was also another lady who books tours, I cant remember her name, however she was very friendly and informative and catered to our needs. The facilities were fantastic. There is a gym, a pool, bistro, bar and room service. And the view from the top of the hotel is lovely. I recommend the desert safari tour, the city sights tour and the dinner cruise tour if you get the chance to ever visit Dubai which can be booked at the hotel. Dubai is such a beautiful city my mum and I are absolutely in love with it and I would go again in a heart beat. But I know that if it wasn't for the staff at the Holiday Inn Downtown, we probably wouldn't have been as open to all the experiences nor would we have appreciated the place as much as we do. We feel forever loyal to Holiday Inn Downtown and whenever I get the chance to go back to Dubai again I know that I don't need to worry about accommodation as that is where I definitely will be staying. We are now halfway through our trip and to be honest with you we are pretty disappointed with the accommodation so far. Holiday Inn Downtown really set the bench mark which I believe will be nearly impossible to beat.

So many other colleagues, again sorry I can\u2019t remember everybody\u2019s names, were also very attentive to our request and helpful during our stay in your hotel. Service from Reservation, Reception, and Room service to Lobby tea lounge was extremely out standing and remarkable. Keep up the good spirit.

Our first experinece of this type of hotel in Dubai. We have always stayed in hoilday inns or crowne plazas around the world but this was the first that supplied 'Extras' if you know what i mean. During a business drink we were asked by a young lady if we wanted company, we declined thi offer but she stuck around until we left. we then found her there everynight pestering us during the stay. it got to a point we never went in there as we knew she would be there and found ourselves hidin from her. The indian disco is an experinece although you dont need to attend to hear the music. what ever floor you are on you will hear the music so if your using this hotel as a stop over to get sleep forget it as it goes on to 3am. The food is not good and the pool is a death trap with broken tiles and pool surrounds. There are only 2 sun loungers that are extremly dirty, (Dont believe the pictures on the web site). we paid approximetly \u00a3100 per night but even if the price was \u00a350 i still would never stay. I emailed Hoilday Inn on my return and they offered 20000 bonus points and said they would contact the hotel, but looking at otehr reviews it dosent look as though they have changed it. I carried on with my complaint and was eventullay given a total of 70 000 points as compensation. The sooner Hoilday Inn remove this hotel from the group the better its brand will grow espesially with class hotels such as Crowne Plaza sheik Zayed Rd (one of the best hotels ever stayed) and the opening of the new Crowne Plaza at Festival City (which is cheaper than this Brothel).

Also when we arrived the hotel the reception insisted to have our passprots, however what we had only ID cards(there are an agreement among Gulf countries that the citizens can travel amongGulf countries by ID cards and no need for passports) like Europe by mistake I had a copy of my passport in my car but what about if I do not have?!? even the parking is very small and the most of it are not sun roofed.
