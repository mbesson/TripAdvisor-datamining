My husband was there for work and we went along w/ him to finish out the summer. He was still working when we checked in and the front desk gave us a hard time because my name was not on the reservation. After dealing w/ his secretary and central reservation to get my name added, I finally got into the room after almost 2 hours. When we first walked into the room, it was modern as expected. Upon closer inspection, you can see the room was heavily painted over and the cabinets and material used were sort of Ikea and cheap. The carpet was dirty and the bathroom was tiny and dark. I have stayed at a few other W and my expectation for this brand is quite high because of my past experiences. Our room only had a tiny window w/ a view of the courtyard. I was not too happy w/ the set up and went downstairs to ask for another room w/ a view. I met Halbert at the front desk and he said there were none available at the moment but 2 might become available the next day. he made some notes for us to be moved since we were staying a total of 3 nights. we had all of our things packed early next morning for the bellman to move our stuff once the other room became available. we came back to our room around 3pm and everything was still there. i had to go downstairs to check on the status and after waiting for about 45 minutes, the girl at the front desk finally said another was available for us to move. After spending another hour to move and get settled, we saw that the new room on the 2nd floor was e bit dirtier and the bathroom was even smaller. there was no way to fit anymore than 1 person. You had to move around the door in order to close it and sit down on the toilet. the toilet paper holder was broken and the paper kept on falling on the floor and there was no counter space to even put the paper. We slept the 2nd night in the new room and the bed is normally the best thing about the W, but no this hotel. Both beds felt like the spring wanted to pop. We thought the internet would be included w/ the full price we paid, but it was not. Even when we paid, it did not work. When I went to the lobby, I voiced my Internet issues and there were 2 other business men there w/ the same issues. I asked if they had a computer for guests and they did not. They offered to print what I needed but there was no way I would let anyone see my private information. The amenities at this W was really limited and what they did offer was painfully expensive. The valet was almost $40 and internet was not cheap. The rooms at this W was just ok, not horrible but not that great. I shared my thoughts w/ the GM and he was very patient in hearing everything i had to say. I did also tell him that I thought Halbert and a few other valet and bellman staff were just great. Overall, the staff was quite good but the shortcomings of the hotel were quite long and could be fairly easy to address. I suggested that he should comp every guests the internet charge because it was not working properly. In addition, when the hotel does not provide it in the lobby, they should comp it for all guests. He did comp us one night and I thought that was a good peace offering for our experience at his hotel. If we come back, I would consider staying here again especially if they make the effort and fix the rooms to the W standards.", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, New York, United States", "Title": "\u201cExcellent from check in to check out!\u201d", "Author": "Mark S", "ReviewID": "UR138571537", "Content": "Everyone from front desk staff to the valet was friendly and excellent!

We booked this hotel with a little trepidation as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had a really horrid stay at one of the W hotels in NYC. However I cannot rave about this hotel enough. The location is great; the rooms are extremely comfortable and have a really fun decor throughout. The pool, whilst small, was great, it was wonderful to hang out there after a hard day shopping and eating our way through NO. The food at the restaurant is fabulous and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me started on the cocktails.... All of this is great, but to some degree what you would expect of a luxury boutique hotel. What really makes this place so totally amazing is the staff. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d read a few reviews whilst planning our stay and to be honest had been a little cynical about the staff reviews. However, we did not receive even good service when we were there; it was exceptional ALL of the time. Without exception! The team was never \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in your face\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but they made you feel utterly unique and important. No request was too much trouble. I feel terrible not listing out everybody who made our stay so wonderful, but 2 people I have to single out are Abbey who runs the bar, nicest lady ever who makes the best cocktails! She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really inventive, it was fun to give her the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel like something kinda .....\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd challenge and see what she gave you, it was unfailingly a winner each time. Just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to be able to walk away from the bar when she is done with you! The other person I have to single out is Staci on Front Desk. Amazing, fantastic, wonderful. She really sealed the deal for us. Nothing was too much trouble; she was always warm and welcoming and really went beyond the call of duty to help us with all our requests. Staci alone has completely made us rethink our opinion of the W group. We cannot wait to get back to the hotel!

Our room was not ready when we arrived so we went for lunch. Upon returning, the room we were given was the dirtiest hotel room I'd ever seen. I travel for a living and spend each week in rooms costing far less than this hotel and had never seen anything so dirty. The carpet had stains everywhere, the walls were stained, the furniture stained, even the decorative box spring cover was stained. I was afraid to put my bag down. There was also a small window with no view. I went back down to the lobby and politely expressed my displeasure. After about 15 minutes of management discussions away from me, I was told if I was patient again, another room would eventually be ready. I sat in the outdoor courtyard hoping to get some work done in the meantime, but could not get on the internet as it wasn't working. We were later placed into a completely renovated room with a balcony overlooking the pool. A beautiful room and experience. Night and day from the other room. We had a nice stay from that point on, but I kept thinking how dreadful it was for the hotel to try and offer filthy rooms at a premium price. Regarding the renovations, to be fair, they look great, but if you look closely, our furniture drawer couldn't close and the paint on the bathroom mirror looked liked a kindergarten project. The hotel did refund one nights points for inconvience which was appreciated.

This \"boutique\" hotel while we stayed there was completing renovations and as a result some painting, hammering and other slight inconveniences were noted. Let's first look at the rooms: When we originally checked in we were given a room next to the gym or what the brand calls \"sweat\". The room number is 230 - this room is very small and would suggest the smallest in the hotel with maybe two-three feet on either side of the kingsize bed and a bit more at its foot. The bathroom is also very small as are most of the bathrooms in the hotel. The theme of the room includes a large painted \"trumpet bell\" in black and yellow as it tries to echo the New Orleans sound. Two other rooms that we evenutally ended up in also were themed in the same manner. When the staff asked how our accommodations were and we noted how small the room was, they immediately looked at moving us to one that was more spacious. This new room 220 was a corner room however had air conditioning issues which resulted in a third move to the 5th floor with a dormer window. The Sobou restaurant in the hotel has a limited but wonderful breakfast menu. Try the french toast with bananas and fosters sauce - incredible!! Hotel Courtyard - small outdoor pool but a nice area to sit, relax, read and have a beverage. Staff - what can I say....some of the staff really made a difference - Staci at reception who welcomed us to the hotel; the young lady who checked us out and a young lady whose name escapes me from the \"engineering department\" - thank you!!! Location - if the French Quarter is where you want to be - great location and minutes from Bourbon and Canal Streets. Business Centre - none. There is also no guest user computer. The front desk will however gladly print your flight boarding passes for you. Would I stay there again?

There are great qualities and other not so great things about each them. But our stay at W last night trumped them all! First of all the customer service is wonderful. We told them that it was my husband's birthday and from the moment we stepped up to the front desk, and spoke with Stacy, we were treated like royalty. We asked if there were any upgrades (as gold members, we can be upgraded if available) and she set us up in a wonderful suite, gave us comp. drink cards and personally walked us to the room. Stacy is what every front desk worker should be: friendly, helpful and cheerful. She made you feel like that they were proud that we'd chosen the W for our hotel stay.

This was our first visit to this property, and likely the last. The hotel is (allegedly) almost finished with a total remodel. The courtyard is beautiful, and the remodeled rooms, like the one we stayed in, are in questionable taste but quite comfortable. However, we were not told when we booked our five nights that the entire hotel remains open while it is a massive construction site. We woke up every morning at or before 9 am to the sounds of hammering and sawing right above our heads. The room next to the pool is a staging area for the construction of the new restaurant, and the lobby is blocked from the restaurant construction by a hanging black sheet. When we complained about the noise, the staff essentially shrugged and told us there was nothing they could do about it. They politely confirmed that the construction started at 9 am, and that even if we moved rooms, that the property is so small that the noise travels, and that they couldn't guarantee that any room would be quiet. This review is not a complaint about the staff, because there is nothing they could do. In fact, they refunded us a few Starwood points and I think they were helpless. This is a complaint about Starwood and W Hotels. It is ridiculous for a luxury hotel group, one that is expensive and has a reputation for excellence, to keep the hotel open and take money from people when our room, at certain points during our stay, was not habitable. It is an insult to us as customers and as Starwood members. We went on vacation to relax and enjoy ourselves, and instead we woke up every day when the hotel decided to begin construction.

This hotel has a fabulous location & is more like a boutique hotel than a standard hotel. The hotel has so much ambiance with a BEAUTIFUL courtyard with a small pool. We were there for 5 nights & during that time the hotel offered free drinks in the courtyard on 2 occasions for several hours (11-6 on one of the days) Wow... was that great!! But, for some reason, they BLASTED music so loud you could not carry on a conversation. We asked them if they would turn it down & they complied. It was still too loud... I'm talking loud like a rock concert, so we again requested that they lower the music again & they again complied. It was still horribly loud so we requested earplugs, which we were provided, but didn't really help & also made conversation impossible. As you have probably read in previous reviews, the hotel is still under renovation. Seemed most of the renovations were taking place in the front, Chartres Street side of the hotel, where the reception area and the restaurant, SoBou (due to open July 9), are being remodeled. We thought the renovations would have no affect on us as our room was on the courtyard side. Well, to our dismay, we were awakened at EXACLY 9:00 am on 2 occasions.. Although the rooms were nice, & actually quite large for a standard \"Wonderful\" room with 2 double beds, there seemed to be a lack in planning. Our biggest complaint about the room was... THERE ARE ZERO towel racks in the bathroom (or anywhere else in the room)... there is a grab bar inside the shower (no bathtub) where the towels were hung. So, you have to remove the towels to take a shower & then there is no other place to hang them when you are done, except on door handles or back on the grab bar. There was wall space large enough in our room to accommodate a towel rack so I hope someone reads this and rethinks this towel rack situation. I did call down to reception to see if we could get a towel stand, but they did not have any. The room was also not equipped with a magnifying makeup mirror, but reception was able to provide us with one. I travel a lot & have found that makeup mirrors are very common in hotels & even cruise ships so I was surprised they did not already have them in the rooms. Also, there are no drawers & very little counter space in the bathroom. The bedroom was better appointed. There was a large flat panel TV in the room and a nice desk. This room had at least 6 easily accessible electrical outlets which is very rare in most hotels, so there were plenty of places to plug in all of the electronics that are now so necessary in our lives. There was no real dresser with drawers, but there was a cabinet area underneath the television with drop down doors that revealed a couple of shelves that you could use as drawers, just a little harder to access your belongings. We found the staff at the hotel to be very friendly and accommodating. At one point one staff member even ran a personal errand for one of my traveling companions. Wow... who does that? It was also very helpful that we could get our airline boarding passes printed in reception and delivered to our rooms, so we got to bypass the aggravation of getting our boarding passes at the airport. I'm sure I will return to this hotel in the future as I believe most of the issues are related to the renovations. & PLEASE... turn the music down in the courtyard!!", "Date": "July 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGood Location\u201d", "Author": "Amexwtc", "ReviewID": "UR132977136", "Content": "Very good location, although one of the floors and main lobby under construction they did a good job.

First, the property is undergoing renovation. When we booked our trip a few months ago, they told us the renovations would be complete by early May. When we arrived, renovations were far from done. So right off the bat, I was kind of turned off. However, based on my husband's status with SPG, we were able to get a newly renovated room (the only floor that is renovated is the 2nd floor). Overall, the staff was pretty good- we really liked the Bellhops and housekeeping- both were super attentive and accommodating to our needs. The front desk staff (in a makeshift lobby) was a different story. They were rude to say the least. The rooms- okay, I have to say, I was very surprised to walk into a renovated room and find it completely off brand for W properties. I expect consistency from the W brand; I usually get that consistency with every W property I stay at. I'm not sure what's going on with the design of this particular W. I felt like I was in a bad porn movie when I walked into our room. The walls are black and gold (okay, I get it, the colors of New Orleans, but really, did they need to do the entire room in these colors) with one wall and part of the ceiling in a green grass design accent. The bathroom was bright orange and black tile everywhere. The mirror in the bathroom had a cut out of a bow tie. I'm sorry, but I think that is weird and so off brand. I also felt like the construction was kind of shotty. The shower was not level so a puddle formed at your feet and the shelf in the shower that holds the shampoo, etc was also uneven. The good news is, the beds were exactly what you would expect- super comfy- great nights sleep. Construction was being done on all the floors above us, so if you were in your room between 9am-5pm, you heard construction. The W gym was not finished so they offered to either shuttle you to the other W (about 8 mins away) or you could walk to the Sheraton (just a few blocks) and use that gym. Not awful, but not convenient either. Since they do not have a dining room during construction, you could order room service- but it was slow and they were out of a lot of things. So not a great option. The pool- super small. Only about 12 or so chairs - very small area. But the actual courtyard itself was really nice- lots of great seating and peaceful. The best part of this property is the location, location, location!!! You are in the heart of the French Quarter- walking distance to EVERYTHING. Seriously amazing location.

It would have been easy to say, it's just not possible, but she kept at it. All of the gentleman who work the valet and generally just help a girl out with directions and bags and dinner suggestions and getting a cab and keeping our kids entertained- wow, thank you. The property is authentic, it's real New Orleans. That means that the walls are a little thin and you can hear people in the courtyard, but it reallly was not an issue for us, even during the height of mardis gras. If you are used to hearing crickets at night then bring some earplugs or pick some up for a buck at the walgreens around the corner. The pool is heated and it's fantastic to swim in the evening and they have great cabanas and lounge chairs around the pool. Not having a restaurant is NOT a problem. My favorites for a quick bite: Something else cafe (and they have an egg white omelette with sweet potato hash), camelia grill, or just pop across the street to fleur de lis for a breakfast sandwich. My family really enjoyed sitting around the fountain at night under the candle lit trees. Thanks so much for a great stay- we have one more day and then it's back home!

This hotel is one of the worst hotel we have ever stayed at!!!! We had problem after problem after problem after problem our entire stay! We would rate this hotel 0 stars if possible!!!! Staying here was a nightmare! Here is a list of everything that was wrong with this hotel: 1. Room was not ready when we checked in...we were told to walk around the French Quarter until the room was ready and was promised a call when ready which we never received. Walking around for an hour would not have been a problem if it was not pouring rain! The hotel offered an umbrella for our use but apparently they were out of stock after they offered us an umbrella. 2. Room keys were not available when our room was finally ready and was told we would receive a call in our room when ready! We never received a call, we wasted 2 hours waiting in our room! 3. Extremely loud music was blasting in the courtyard from 9am - 10pm daily despite numerous complaints from multiple guests that they were unable to relax. The music was so loud you could hear it in the halls and rooms. Finally after complaining 5 times over a period of 2 days the music was turned down to a tolerable level. 4. Acura car service was not available as they informed us the car was in the shop for repairs. The hotel seriously only has one car?!? We made reservations weeks in advance for the car service! We were told it would be back Sunday or Monday, we called to check the status both days but the car was still in the shop. BS! 5. The cable/picture quality was extremely poor and movie channels were not available. The hotel sent someone to check it out, he came in tightened the cable and left. He called us about 10 minutes later to see if it was working but it wasn't and instructed us to unplug and plug back in and fiddle with the cables...ummm isn't that your job?!?!?! By the time he came back up to try again it was way too late in the night to even bother with it. 6. Day 3 of our stay there wasn't any hot water in our room! We went down to the front desk to complain along with a list of several things that were broken or disgusting in our room to be fixed while we were out. The girl at the front desk promised to have all our issues addressed and fixed asap. Only 2 of the items from our list were addressed and the rest were ignored! 7. Walls are paper thin...you can hear everything inside and outside the hotel! 8. Hotel staff is unresponsive and sometimes rude when complaining about something wrong with the hotel. 90% of complaints were not addressed! 9. The cleaning staff does a very poor job cleaning rooms and straightening up. Our room was covered in dust for days! 10. The last day of our stay there was heavy construction being done to the restaurant, it was intolerable! The construction workers started jack hammering around 10am! We called at 1:30pm to ask how long this was going to be going on and to complain about the noise & the jack hammering shaking our room the girl at the front desk was extremely rude! She stated with a nasty attitude \"You think that's bad???? Try sitting at the front desk! Construction was also extremely annoying when taking a dip in the tiny pool. Seriously what luxury hotel does major construction during tourist season?!?!? 11. As we were packing up on our last night we noticed that one of our bags of gifts we had purchased was missing from our room! We immediately contacted the front desk with concern and anger! We received a call back from the front desk a few minutes later that they were trying to contact a supervisor to get this issue resolved. We had to rush out of our room to try to replace the gifts but the stores were closed! We wasted an hour running around the French Quarter at 12am - 1am in the morning! We went back to the front desk and were told that the cleaning staff must have thrown the bag out by mistake and would try to resolve the issue. Why would the cleaning staff shift through our large stack of purchases and just throw one bag out?!?! The hotel did not offer to cover the loss but rewarded us some Starwood Points...we don't care about points!!! We want our stuff back! We spent hours picking out perfect gifts for friends and coworkers! When we checked out at 6am our issue had yet to be resolved we were told to check out the gift shops in the airport to replace the missing gifts. We have yet to receive a call from the hotel supervisor regarding this issue and it's been over 12 hours!!!!! We will be following up everyday until this issue has been resolved and all Starwood Points have been returned from our stay. Thank god we did not pay for this stay but used Starwood Points. You would think the hotel would treat long time Starwood Members with a little more respect and try to insure their stay is pleasant and relaxing.

It is close enough to be a short walk to Royal or Bourbon Street in one direction and maybe a 10 minute walk from the French Market district. The courtyard is nicely done and a great place to relax while staying. When staying in the French Quarter, you can expect that rooms will be smaller than usual and this held true. But they have worked well with the space they have. The hotel is undergoing renovations right now, so there is no restaurant on site, but in a city known for its food, this wasn't an issue. The service, however, left something to be desired. We arrived at the hotel at 1 pm, before standard check in. At the time we learned that the Internet was down at the hotel, so they could not check us in. It took probably 15 minutes for them to tell us that. When they finally told us, we checked our bags and left our phone number so they could call us when the room was ready and set out to explore. We got back a few hours later to discover that the room was ready, but no one contacted us. We had to be escorted up to the room because the Internet was still down and they could not provide us with keys. Eventually we had to go back down to the lobby to request keys. Their system was up and running again, but no one notified us. I completely understand technical issues which are outside of their control, but I would expect it to be handled much differently when staying at a W hotel. There were numerous other little things which simply don't fit with what one expects while staying at a W hotel. Sunday morning we had no hot water for about 90 minutes. The concierge told us the construction at the hotel stopped on the weekends. Not quite. It was quite loud while we were in our room. Sunday we left the room before noon and returned around 4 pm to find that it had not been serviced. Overall, a great location within the French Quarter. And some of the service was great - the valet remembered us from the first moment and was very helpful! But most of it was lacking. As I mentioned, they are under construction now, so perhaps it will improve in the future.

Woken at 8am with pneumatic drills in what can only be described as a way under par room. My wife was just a teeny bit annoyed and went in search of the manager! Here is where it got better. The manageress just knew what she obviously thought twenty paces out and to her credit did whatever she could. She changed our rooms to something much better and away a bit from the noise and credited our account with $200. She did all she could but should never have been put in this position in the first place. Still however our stay was somewhat spoiled as you just could not stay in the hotel except in your room outside of working hours and there was no public rooms or even a bar available and the super courtyard area was unusable during the day due to the noise. The room was much better however it was still very, very tired and even the duvet smelled and was dirty! Next day they even closed the street in front with a giant crane and three articulated lorries to lift in new aircon onto the roof. The pneumatics then got worse as they moved the compressors into the courtyard and left the doors all open to the work areas. The noise was just.....

The first one was not even near the elevators but the repeated humming noises kept us up until we changed rooms; the second (the one they temporarily switched us to) could not keep the courtyard partier sounds out; the final room we switched to was extremely loud: some party kids were in and out slamming their doors next door, while a couple next door was having an extra long sex session that sounded like they were in our room! * the bathroom sink hot water handle didn't close all the way in the 2nd room and so water leaked * the showers look sleek, but are poorly designed (impossible to turn on the shower from outside the stall w/o getting soaked) * the cordless phone was broken in our 2nd room I am pretty laid back and never really complain given that all I mainly care about is that the hotel can provide a good night's sleep and is clean.

There were several small local restaurants just across the street which we loved. Why pay $$$ for the same hotel fair when you could pay $ for local faves and a 7 AM Bloody Mary (with free refills). We arrived at 8 AM, not expecting to check in, but the front desk staff accommodated us by booking us into the highly modernized model room. We loved it! On-site pool is very quiet - In fact, we felt we were swimming in private for hours every afternoon. And the location could not be beat. In the heart of the French Quarter, just steps away from Jackson Square, NOLA, the riverfront, Canal Street, Decatur Street, Bourbon Street (but far enough away not to be disturbed by the late-night din). For anywhere we couldn't walk, the hotel provided a free car ride, which saved us many $$ on taxi rides. A tiny, but very appreciated detail - the turntable and old-timey jazz records that we found in our room. What a nice little touch.

After booking I failed to get an email confirming the booking, but did eventually get an email about what was happening in the French Quarter that weekend. And another. Finally got a third email saying that due to refurbishment there was no hotel, or even breakfast except via room service. Got to the room late and tired, as I was going to bed I noticed that the carpet was wet... Next morning not only was the carpet still wet, but it also smelled of vomit.... Went straight to the front desk (a temporary welcome desk) where, to be fair, the staff were as appalled as I was and arranged to have the carpet shampooed, which it duly was. 24 hours later the carpet was dry, but I thought there was still a faint smell. Yuk! Other things: Shower often took minutes to get warm and occasionally didn't heat at all; you could get coffee downstairs in the temporary welcome desk from six am - on Sunday morning I waited 35 minutes for the coffee to appear, being told \"it will be here soon\" every five or ten minutes; finally and most annoyingly I paid $16.95 to watch the new Harry Potter VII pt2 movie - it was poor quality, jumping AND they cut off the last five minutes - possibly the most important bit. They do have all sorts of add-ons and trendy things - a bottle of red wine, two glasses and a corkscrew attached to the wall. An iPod player and charger by the bed. BUT there was no desk in my room, just a small round table - how can you work at that? The walls are thin, the doors are incredibly noisy, my room had two doors to adjoining rooms to make it into a suite - these doors were even thinner, you could hear complete conversations. The lack of any dining area or foyer to sit in made it more like a poor man's B&B rather that a real hotel.

My husband & I typically love W Hotels and have stayed in many. We arrived around lunch time. Our room was not ready yet. We happily stored our bags and went for lunch and a walk around to see the city. When we returned it was check in time. We were informed that someone with a higher Starwoods status than us had requested a late check out and our room would not be ready before 5pm. In fact those guests were checking out at 5 so we may have to wait until 6 or so. We had made early dinner reservations at a place that friends had recommended so we really wanted to shower & change after our day of travel. We asked if there was another room that would be ready early. They eventually offered us a room to change in with two doubles and then wanted us to switch out of it to our originally reserved room when it became available. We reluctantly agreed for lack of a better option. When we got to our temporary room we were displeased by the level of cleanliness. More shocking was the rodent trap on the floor near a small hole in the wall. This was unacceptable. Although we were not planning to sleep in this room, my husband & I both felt very uncomfortable knowing there was a rodent issue in this hotel. We found another hotel not far up the street and asked a manager if we could be refunded if we decided not to stay here. The manager was very nice and apologetic. She (Staci) did the best she could considering the situation she was handed. She even offered us a bottle of Champagne to take with us. When we returned home we noticed there had been no refund for the nights we did not stay. After three phone calls with American Express and three weeks the credit was finally issued. I work in the hotel industry. I would never inform a guest that another guest more important than them is causing them an inconvenience. We were given this information in a matter of fact manner and informed that this was standard policy. All kinds of things happen in the hotel business.

Much of the commentary is true: the property is old, some of the rooms and common areas deserve some attention and the rooms are small. I checked in and as a Starwood Gold was upgraded to a Spectacular room. Unfortunately no king Spectaculars were available and I was placed in a double which was useless as I was traveling alone. (Sidenote: the difference between the Wonderful and Spectacular rooms is that the latter has a balcony. Not so spectacular). The walls could use some paint, the bathroom similarly could use a makeover and the furniture was chipped, dented and generally not the sort of aesthetic you expect paying W rates. I asked to be moved and on my third (of four) nights was upgraded again to a Mega room. The second room was much better. There was actually space to place my luggage on the floor, I didn't hear verbatim conversations form my neighbors, my shower got warm instead of just luke warm when turned to maximum hotness, and the room was in better shape. That said, the property is apparently undergoing renovation (true: the restaurant is closed, but alas, no big deal given proximity to other options). Despite the shortcomings, the W French Quarter is still the best choice in the Quarter. The property feels like a boutique property, some of the usual annoying qualities of the W chain are absent (think over the hill Fratboys and the gals that love them drinking Appletinis in the lobby) and the staff is rather excellent. I liked the fact that the hotel had charm and isn't an over the top frilly option like the other small hotels that dominate the quarter. The courtyard is very nice and the location is second to none. I think you have to be careful on what room you end up in (it may be the property is two different buildings combined...my first room had very thin walls, my second room felt better insulated). At any rate, it is not the best W I ever encountered in terms of room quality when it comes to the small details, but the positives clearly outweigh the negatives. Lastly, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, will someone at the W please realize that having so much crap in the room in terms of signage (really, this is a trashcan? Thank God there is a sticky note!), knick knacks (the toy Acura reminding me I could have a ride someone is not necessary), and just general clutter everywhere is the antithesis of why people go to a W. I don't want to feel like I am living in a Target. I always ask that all this stuff be removed form the room, and usually the staff notes that others do too.

Not quite. More like French Quarter Fail. This hotel falls far short of the W standard. We can't quibble with the marvelous location or the attentive, on-top-of-it bellmen and valets. After that, it's a litany of problems. Let's start with the classic W Living Room: It's the size of a postage stamp. In a hotel that does not offer free WiFi in the rooms, the living room's free WiFi is a key perk when you don't want to shell out $15 for a 10-minute check of email. Well, there's pretty much nowhere to sit down. Think you might want a drink? Forget about it. The restaurant has closed so there's no bar service during the week. If you want to sit out in the lovely courtyard, one of the few things this hotel has going for it, it's BYOB during the week. By the way, the hotel fails to mention this if you make reservations through Starwood Preferred. You'll only find notice of this if you dig deep into the fine print of the hotel's website. The hotel should make this plain up front. So what does this really mean? It means if you want some coffee and muffin for breakfast, be prepared to shell out nearly $30. The hotel still offers room service, yet has not waived the 19% service fee despite not offering the option of a full-service restaurant or even a coffee bar. As compensation, the hotel offers guests on arrival the choice between a bottle of $2 Fiji water or a half-bottle of supermarket wine. As for our particular stay, we had reserved a room with a courtyard view. If you consider a sliver of a window in a narrow alcove looking onto a roof a room with a view, then you're in for a treat. For the hotel to place us, _Gold Preferred members_ in this horrible room in New Orleans in August, with a barely half-full hotel, it's really unforgivable. We did ask for another room. The woman at reception rightly tried to move us to a patio room, which would have been an upgrade. She said it would be ready at 4 p.m. It was not. We were finally moved to another room with a decent window and pleasant view. The room itself is shabby with scratched furniture and soiled carpeting. The bathroom had mildew in the shower and cracked marble on the vanities. My advice to loyal Starwood folks: Choose the W on Poydras or the Sheraton on Canal.

We do not really have any idea what the average room was like or not like. First, you would be hard pressed to beat the location. The entire French Quarter is walkable from this property. Even if your definition of walkable means only a few blocks, this is still an eminently well positioned hotel. Second, if your stay in New Orleans is likely to focus on the night life, then again, this is a great property. The pool and courtyard were set up to be pool and party friendly. Lots of places to lounge, small private cabanas, music, and the like. Third, if you accept that a rennovation is in process, you'll be okay. We didn't see the rennovation from where we were, and we certainly didn't hear it. However, our room was definitely tired. The furniture was clean, but definitely worn. Not all of the lighting worked ideally - for example, two different types of light bulbs over the mirror, neither appropriate or bright enough. There was no room service, fair enough we were forewarned - but then there was no in-room coffee service to compensate. It meant putting on some sort of publically acceptable attire and a walk to the lobby. In a day and and age when even Motel 6 has in-room coffee service, this seemed a trifle beneath the W brand. Knowing that a rennovation was in progress leads me to believe that these conditions will change as the rennovation progresses...still, be aware. Fourth, if your version of night-life doesn't involve dance music, then be aware that the music will be blaring in the courtyard until the pool closes at 10-10:30pm. While the hotel was remarkably quiet when the music was off, the solid bass beats emanating from the robust pool speaker system will prove more than capable of suppressing anything, like a TV or your own music, in the room. In sum - great location, average property. When the rennovation is over, it will no doubt meet all of the normal W brand standards. Be aware that, like the French Quarter around it, this is designed to be a brash and lively property. If you want to leave your party at the street when you return to the hotel, this may not be the property for you.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cStandard W experience....

Paul exudes enthusiasm, knowledge of the area, and a willingness to share his inside information about the French Quarter. In a word, he is an Ambassador of goodwill for both the \"W\" hotel and the French Quarter. We stayed in one of the four \"Carriage House\" rooms in the courtyard area with a nice view of the pool and outside lounge area. This \"W\" is currently placing the finishing touches on a restaurant and bar which will definitely add to its amenities. Our room was spotlessly clean, well appointed, and very comfortable. Because of the older French doors leading to the small balcony; courtyard/pool noises tend to bleed into the room which can be annoying if there are late night partiers. Loved the room and it's location though and would accept the trade off any time. It's been 5 years since I've stayed at a W, the last one being the W Lakeshore in Chicago which I wrote a review about. At that time the Chicago W was #57 and I predicted they'd slip further toward triple digits. They've subsequently become #81 The W - French Quarter is currently ranked #65 in New Orleans but with staff members like Paul Reed they are bound to improve that. The staff was always courteous, attended to and rectified any problem quickly, and provided the whatever/whenever experience. They even provided a small refrigerator in my room for cold storage of some supplies I had delivered. Although we didn't have the opportunity to use the complimentary Acura MDX transit service to anywhere within 6 miles of the hotel between 8AM and 5 PM; I can certainly see how that might be very helpful. If they offered pick up service for late night club hopping it would be even nicer (hint). Overall, I'd recommend this facility for anyone visiting the French Quarter that desires a place convenient to Bourbon Street, The Market, Steamboat, Jazz and Blues Clubs, and other attractions. Thanks for a great stay.

One thing to think about in deciding whether to stay here is that it's basically a boutique property (less than 100 rooms) in the heart of the Quarter, not a traditional W. That has pros and cons - the location is great. You can walk anywhere in the Quarter quickly and easily but you're a little ways from the madness of Bourbon. The building is quaint - especially the courtyard. It's a great place, especially for early risers, to sit and have coffee in the morning or an early drink before dinner (though you'll have to walk next door to get a drink). However, there aren't a ton of upgrades available, the non-upgrade rooms are VERY small, and there aren't a ton of facilities (currently no restaurant in the hotel and only a part-day temporary bar). The pool is also TINY with a total of 5 lounge chairs, 2 chairs and a single cabana. For our stay we knew the hotel was sold out and a Platinum upgrade was highly unlikely, which was fine. We arrived early and were pre-registered into a room and promised a call when ready, which never came. When we checked back and were put into our room. It was small - I mean NYC small - with NO view at all - literally the backside of another building. When I mentioned this they did tell me that as a Plat I shouldn't have been put into this room and they offered 5k points in apology. There were a number of other small issues that were similar - a pre-arranged gift for another friend in the hotel wasn't delivered, after having a bottle of room service champagne explode all over the room the promised cleaning crew never arrived, there were long waits in the lobby to see anyone at checkout, etc. I was also very disappointed that of the 3 emails I sent to the hotel (two pre-arrival with questions, one post-departure in response to the \"How'd we do?\" email) only one was even acknowledged. Through all of this the staff was pleasant and tried their best to help, though sometimes ineffectively. All of that said it is a nice property (which will only be nicer after the renovation) and it is in a great location.

All these things I had to go and ask for at reception. These should be automatically there! Also we had to pay for internet access, at the prices we paid per night that shouldnt be the case.

I booked two rooms, and three other couples booked there as well. Initially, my daughter wasn't happy because she was near the construction that other people have noted in these reviews. They moved her twice, and on the third try she was happy that she had a quiet (but smaller) room. Our room on the 4th floor, facing the courtyard was quiet until the day we checked out & they began sanding the wall below our window. Can't complain too much because it didn't start til 10:00. The manager, Brian, is professional and helpful. If you have any problems, he's the go-to person. I had left a photo album in a taxi coming from the airport & the receipt didn't have the name of the taxi company. The desk helped me by looking up all the taxi companies that had white vans. I got my album back the next day. The room was very comfortable & well maintained, except that we had to ask for service on Mother's Day. They must have been short staffed. The beds, linens & pillows were 'Heavenly'! We had one problem which was only partially resolved. There were 6 of us going on a tour & we were running late. We asked the valet to hail a van for us, and he offered to take us in the hotel's van. When he drove up in it, an arrogant-acting man jumped in the back seat & said 'sorry, ladies... he's taking me.' Brian said there was no reservation on the books for the van & that he would talk to the valet & find out what happened, but he never got back to me. He did give us a bottle of wine though, which was something. But I will never forget how rude that jerk was who jumped into our van, leaving us to search for our own transportation.

Also, the renovations may have some rooms closed. This has always been one of my favorite hotels and I hadn't stayed in a few years. I was a bit worried. Yes, the rooms really need an overhaul and the restaurant is closed, but this quaint little W is working its way back to full capacity. The staff also are very honest about the changes. A little birdie told me that it might have been better to close the place down for a short amount of time to do the renos. And I agree, however you will be treated well. I wonder what they could do to pacify people in the meantime, whether that means offering some sort of a discount or welcome back in the future to spread goodwill. I think it might increase business. Anyhow, if you choose to stay before the renovations are over, and I think you will be just fine, try and ask for even #'d rooms. These have good views and balconies.

We got up to our room -- tired, ready to go to bed -- and lo and behold, it *was* in the middle of being renovated. Everything covered in plastic, no sheets on the bed -- couldn't stay there. Went back to Yessenia, the awesome front desk agent, who apologized profusely and proceeded to find us our real room. We left to get some food, only because it was taking a while for her to track down which room (again, the only un-being-renovated, unoccupied one left in the hotel) was actually ours. Came back an hour later, the rock star Yessenia has found our room, sent our bags up, and comped us the night. Now we're talking! But then, as I'm settling in, reading for a few minutes before turning off the light... I see it. A mouse. A MOUSE! For real? At the W? At the prices they charge? At this point, I'm exhausted and freaking out. Yessenia is very apologetic, and will move us promptly in the morning, but can't do anything at the moment. Fine. I talk myself down and try and get some rest. Housekeeping wakes us up the next day by entering our room (fine, understandable, we forgot to put out the do-not-disturb sign), but as we're scrambling to cover up and asking her to leave, the woman is just standing there, repeatedly demanding to know if we have a late check out. Finally, many minutes later, the husband has to literally say, \"Please leave the room NOW, we need to get dressed, and you're making us uncomfortable.\" Housekeeping fail number one. Then they move us to the new room, and what's the first thing my eyes fall on when I enter? A dirty q-tip, yellow with ear-wax. Just left there, hanging out in the overpriced snack tray/mini-bar area. Housekeeping fail number two. SIGH. The rest of the stay was uneventful (though we did overhear the front desk clerk recommend a lunch spot to a couple that, when we walked by the same restaurant moments later, we saw was closed).

When you click there it opens up the following statement: From December 22, 2010 through May 5, 2011, we will undergo a multi-million dollar renewal. The renewal will be executed in multiple stages and includes the restaurant, deck to our courtyard staircase, hotel exterior and all guest room balconies and windows. During this period, we will tailor our schedule to create minimal inconvenience. What they fail to mention is that there is no restaurant, there is no bar, there is no room service, except for breakfast from a little place up the street, and the rooms are in very bad need of renovation. The carpet is stained and the woodwork is very beat up. In addition there was a cold snap and the outside temp was quite chilly so their HVAC would not work to keep the rooms cool except by opening the windows. This of course allowed the noise from those who had experienced their first Hurricane at Pat O'Briens to serenade us at 4am hence no sleep! Acura Service: Although discussed prior to check in that we would use for dining, it is not available after 5pm. The Restaurant is no longer there. They have no bar. The \"living room\" is the check in lobby and all of 8ft by 12ft, yes very cozy! The first night we were there, we got no sleep due to the noise with the window open to stay cool. They offered to move us to the 4th floor from the 3rd but it was even noisier due to construction on the 5th floor. They acted surprise. Everything, including having coffee available in the \"living room\" seemed like a real effort. They ran out of coffee and it took 30 minutes to get more made.

The wi-fi didn't work in the rooms. We were on the fourth floor facing the street and you could hear every word people on the street said. The courtyard area looked nice, but was under construction.

A lot of hotels in the quarter have quirks and issues, and you just sort of sift through them and decide what works for you and what price you want to pay. I have stayed here two different times. What I love about this hotel are the location, the courtyard, the pool, the decor of the check-in room, and the quality of the service when someone is available. The rooms are a decent size, as are the bathrooms, and the bed very comfortable. I also love Bacco, the restaurant next door that also provides room service. I love the small size and intimate feel. I hate the street noise if you face the street. I hate how thin the walls are (could hear a complete conversation in normal tones in the room next door). I hate the HVAC (the hallways are frigid, and it is tough to hit the right temp in the room). I hate that there is this big bathroom but only a shower, and that both rooms I have been in had a shower that leaks. I hate that the bathroom door is a barn-door-style frosted glass slider, which offers an illusion of privacy, but not actual privacy (visually you are OK with the way the room is laid out, but acoustically is a different story). I hate that there is a wonderful, but small staff, and sometimes you can't find someone to help you with something for 5-10 min. I hate that they constantly close the courtyard for events, which can make your quiet courtyard-overlooking room as loud as a street room. I hate that they can never manage to provide the water you are supposed to get as a platinum member. There's also a lot of deferred maintenance in the carpeting, paint, etc. If the rates were a bit cheaper, I would suggest this hotel more enthusiastically. As it is, it is a lovely place to stay, but you should investigate some other choices as well.

Not very helpful when 1 mile is walkable, but in certain cases it's a nice option) We were always met with a smile and pleasant attitude from everyone. It should be noted that this is not the typical W hotel you may have stayed at in other big cities. It's trendy but VERY small and not very well laid out. The welcome desk is a tiny little area in the front of the hotel on Chartres. It is your check-in/consierge/computer station in one. It's a bit of an odd cramped setup, but really pretty inside. The elevators to the rooms are across the driveway. Also note: the walls in the rooms are PAPER THIN. It sure is noisy in there! Bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper, and I would recommend requesting a courtyard view room instead of a street view like we had. Lots of noise in the morning and at night from outside. The rooms were nice though with comfy beds and large bathrooms. They have a beautiful courtyard with a nice (but very tiny) pool. On the weekends we enjoyed poolside service from servers in their Bacco restaurant, however we did not see anybody serving outside on the weekdays.

The nighttime noise is horrible and starts with the screaming, yelling and merriment of the French Quarter party patrons. This is followed by the roaring of garbage trucks, beeping of delivery trucks backing up, horns honking etc. Secondly, do not get a room next to the elevator, the mechanical noise, while not as bad as the street facing room, is still substantial and in the morning hours, it moves non-stop so don't plan on getting any sleep. Now for some good news: We have stayed in a Wonderful room facing the courtyard and it was delightful. Quiet, spacious and extremely enjoyable. The service and support staff are fantastic.

We were coming to NOLA for VoodooFest and wanted to stay somewhere in the French Quarter to be close to the Halloween action. For 30,000 points for 3 nights, it was a bargain. However, then there was an additional $90 in valet parking fees, which was somewhat steep. I am Platinum with *wood and realized that the W hotels operate on a different upgrade system than the rest of the company. When checking in, we were given a Superior room on the 3rd floor. When we walked in, the room smelled a bit off, but we couldn't place it. The room was small, and overlooked a rooftop. Not exactly a scenic view. There was also a nice family of spiders inhabiting the windowsill on the room side. We brushed them off, and decided it wasn't a big deal. Upon further inspection, I discovered that not only did we have an ajoining room, we had the middle room of 3 adjoining rooms. I have a note in my *wood profile that says no adjoining rooms due to an unfortunate incident at the Westin City Center, D.C. However, the hotel was booked, and there was no other room I could have moved to. The walls are extremely thin. We heard the good, bad, and ugly each night at the hotel. People let doors slam all night long, and I was treated to 3 horrible nights of sleep. However, it was also Halloween weekend so I was willing to let it slide a bit. Our neighbors liked to listen to music at night/early AM and we could not only hear the notes, we could hear every, single word. There was a lot of slamming noises, etc. so I finally took a Benadryl and put in ear plugs to sleep. Not what I would expect to need to do at a hotel. I've been in my share of noisy hotels, but never to this level. The one redeeming quality of the W is the valet staff. All of the guys were extremely friendly and helpful. The one downside was the fact that upon arrival, we were told that there would be a shuttle to the City Park for $4 a person. The next morning when we tried to catch this shuttle, we were informed the guy that runs it wasn't at work yet. Later that day, we were told there was no shuttle, so we'd have to take the $20 cab ride. Fine, but just be up front about it. All in all, I would not stay here again. As a side note, on the final day in the room, I discovered mold growing in the carpet under the desk in the corner. This would explain all the itching and congestion I had all weekend, as I'm pretty seriously allergic to mold. I have a decent tolerance for hotels, but uncleanliness isn't forgiveable. The location of the hotel is fantastic, but the W on Poydras isn't much further and from the looks of it, appeared to be better kept.", "Date": "November 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Nice Digs\u201d", "Author": "Beaurex212", "ReviewID": "UR47893265", "Content": "Beautiful property, centrally located in French Quarter.

No ability to sign up via a roaming account as far as I could tell. Lovely courtyard, tiny pool. No gym - but you have use of the gym in the other W hotel about 10 mins walk away.

Reception didn't seem surprised when I mentioned the noise and I wondered if it was a 'known issue' with the room. Definitely detracted from the experience. The room issue is the only detraction and I'd be really happy to return to the hotel again in a different room.

Other than this, the room was right on the main courtyard with the loud music as the other reviews discuss, but that did not bug me. Actually, I thought it was a pretty cool setup. My main problem with the place is that the room was very tired and in need of an update. The furniture / walls / carpet all looked like they were 10 years old - used and abused.

We were checked in from Wednesday through Sunday yet were not offered the same. Seemed a little random to ration the tickets that way. Boarding passes were printed for us on request. Requested taxi was waiting at the appointed time for departure. But in general, good service. Elevators: Only one was working the entire time we were there. It seemed to generally stick on the third floor and do a false, premature opening of the doors on the ground floor before safely opening. Didn't exactly inspire confidence. Pool area: Seemed nice, but we didn't spend time there. I did note the music which is played in the pool area. I didn't think it loud, but then my room didn't open to the courtyard. I was also there while a Saturday night private party took over the entire pool area (basically, the whole courtyard). Nothing better than being made to feel like an outsider in your own hotel by party guests who didn't pay a dime to be there. I am SO glad I didn't have one of the rooms which has doors or windows opening directly to the pool during that. Talk about a nuisance. Room: We had a standard room. VERY minimal. Very small. No closet. No chest of drawers. Only a wardrobe with hangers and two small drawers on the bottom. It did have an in-room safe, though. That was helpful. The bathroom was a series of design flaws. The door to the bathroom was a hung wooden door with frosted glass on a celing track. No floor track. You had to sort of push the door out and slide it over to avoid whacking the wall. Not exactly a quiet procedure if it's the middle of the night and you are trying to avoid waking someone. And with the frosted glass door, turning on the light at night is bound to wake your roommate. By all that is holy, KEEP THE TOILET SEAT DOWN. There was a teeny, unstable glass shelf that was the only surface large enough to store anything. As it was directly below where towels were hung and right beside the sink, things were constantly getting knocked off the shelf. They always ended up in the toilet until we realized we needed to just always keep it closed. The walls were VERY thin in our room. Window opened to a view of the tops of buildings. Sort of industrial. But then we certainly didn't spend time at the window. The room was definitely the worse for wear. It had seen a couple too many Jazzfests and Mardi Gras. Stained carpet. Cigarette hole in our non-smoking room bedspread. But the walk-in shower was nice. Had hot water all but the last morning. Location: Easy walk to everything in the quarter. Nice amenities: Coffee in the morning in their Welcome Center. Ice water flavored with fresh fruit replaces the coffee later in the day. Grab the Times-Picayune, Wallstreet Journal or USAToday from the shelves across from the elevator in the morning. Local paper even available on weekends. Bottom line: The rooms are run down and need sprucing. Service was adequate. Best reason to stay there is location.

Traveling with 2 teens and best friend. I was looking for a hotel that had the traditional architecture and look of the French Quarter combined with the contemporary hip upmarket feel of a boutique hotel. Finally settled on the W, somewhat hesitatingly as I was toying with the Ritz (NOT a great location), Monteleone (nope) and others. We all were soo happy we made the right decision. Location fantastic - Chartres charming little street with great shopping (Hemline - fab boutique). Straight shot to Jackson Square - 3 or 4 mini blocks. I made it a priority to have a peek at some of the other contender hotels and found them to be either funky location (in a bad way) or really dated/rough around the edges. Personally, I would not stay on or near St Charles or out of the Quarter. Ditto Bourbon St, unless people running around with ridiculously strong cocktails and ridiculously impaired minds is your idea of a good time. W was a little haven - understated, hip and quiet. We had a room on the 2nd floor with balcony overlooking Chartres Street. Perfect! Had 2 dbl beds, so good for traveling with teens. Room dark and sleek, but big bathroom with Bliss products, which were pilfered on a daily basis. Kids highly amused at mini bar offerings, including the romance pack of lubricant, condom and breath freshner!!! Balcony w/French doors brought light and gave much needed space to beleagured mother! Best part of the hotel, of course, is the courtyard. Balinese oversized beds with cool tables. Candles. Small pool. Cool music. Video shown against side of hotel depicting various room scenes - guests looking out window - very \"Rear Window\". Only minor downsides - room service is linked to the Italian restaurant downstairs which doesn't offer a great variety of app/snack items - only really an issue for kidlings, but so much around, really, a non-issue. Also - service not terriffic, but possibly due to full house. Breakfast - go across the street to the Fleur de Lys - amazing and quick food. Pizza place (Rotelos) also across the street and killer calzones. Stanley on the square good for lunch. Take the New Orleans Haunted History tour with Jonathan as your guide.

I am generally a Starwood fan, but not in this case. We reserved two suites using Starpoints for a long weekend with friends. Our friends checked into suite 201. It did have a nice balcony overlooking Chartres Street. The closet rod was not attached to the wall, but they were handy and fixed it themselves. (They had a screwdriver with them, go figure!) The door to the minibar cabinet was completely off its hinges, which they politely ignored. There was a TV in the bathroom, for which the remote didn't work. It ultimately was fixed by maintenance - with duct tape. The shower was in a moldy claw-foot tub which was difficult for them to access. That was the good experience. We were originally put into the suite on the opposite side of the second floor. There was a loud courtyard speaker directly outside the bedroom window, so there was no rest possible until night-time when the sound went off. They said they could \"turn it down\" \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but we didn't want to be fighting that battle for 4 days, so we asked to be moved. No other suites were available. They promised to refund us the point difference between a suite and a regular room, which they did after I called to bug them a few days later. They put us on the 5th floor overlooking the courtyard. It was a large room, but most of the space taken up by huge dormers which were useless space. The shutters on the dormers were broken so they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t close properly. Neither the floor in the dormers nor the shutters on the windows had been cleaned any time in recent memory. There were huge stains on the carpet. There was a leak around the shower door, so it was moldy and the plaster was falling apart. The paint on the walls generally was dirty and scratched up, so that the drywall showed through in several places. There was a disco right across the courtyard from this room, so it was even noisier than the original room. One of the bedside lamps was completely broken (the bulb socket hanging to the side) - maintenance did fix that. The front desk promised to move us to 204 the next day, a connecting room to our friends' suite, and to refund a night's worth of points for our inconvenience (that credit came through without a hitch). They asked us to leave our bags packed so they could be moved while we were out. We returned around 4:30 p.m. The keys we were given didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. So back downstairs. Ordinarily, that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been a big deal, but only one of two elevators was in service the entire time and the stairway doors were locked from the bottom, so every trip upstairs required a lengthy wait for the elevator. Second time the keys worked. Another elevator wait - and this time our bags weren't in the room. Yet another trip downstairs for my partner. He was told the bags were in the hallway outside the room. Valuables left sitting in the hall, are you kidding? No matter, they weren't there anyway. Where were they? No one knew. After a few minutes of waiting and no news, a curt word to the desk clerk elicited from the duty manager, not a query as to what was wrong and whether she could help, but an admonition not to speak impolitely to her staff. Ultimately the bags were found. My partner had to lug them all up himself, no offer of help. After another wait for the elevator, of course. It was a small room, but the balcony was nice and we could share the sitting area with our friends' suite. And it was not quite as dirty as the room on the 5th floor. The TV didn't work. Maintenance fixed it by fiddling with the nest of wires under the desk and replaced the batteries in the remote. At least two of the outlets in the room (including the outlet by the sink for the hair dryer) didn't work, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother with reporting those. Overnight the room became stifling. The next morning, maintenance told us that was \"normal,\" that the cool air was escaping through the connecting door to the suite (which had been closed during the night and, in any event, did have cool air and working a/c) and (most importantly) that the thermostat had to be set at 40 degrees F to work. We gave up on that as well. The final evening in this room the hot water stopped working as we were trying to get ready for dinner. A call to \"whatever, whenever\" resulted in enough lukewarm water for a quick shower, though no explanation. On return from our evening out, it was completely off again. A call downstairs produced no results or reply. About an hour later, we called Starwood customer service. They opened a file on our case and called the hotel. All they got was excuses - it is an old hotel, it takes the hot water a while to get there. All transparent fibs, as usually the hot water worked fine, and in any event it was completely back on the next morning. The issues weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t solely room-related. As I already noted, there was only one working elevator. The (limited) common areas were as dirty and decrepit as the rooms. The linens were stringy and threadbare. Absent a request, housekeeping only left one bar of soap per room, so it had to be moved back and forth between the sink and the shower. A call to room service the first morning for coffee was dismissed with a reply that there was complimentary coffee in the lobby. So we went down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only to find no cups. They scrounged a couple up for us. Several times after that, there were either no cups or the coffee pot was empty. We took to buying coffee across the street. There does not appear to be anyone actually managing this horrible little hotel.

This is our second time in NO and first time at a W Hotel. As mentioned in previous reviews, this hotel has a boutique feel in the heart of the French Quarter. We didn't have any issues with staff - they were all friendly and laid back. If you can get a room or suite during non-peak times it's worth it. We traveled with our 4-year old son who loved the pool and lounge area. By day the hotel is family friendly, by night the hipsters come out and start their drinking in the courtyard. The pool is bathtub warm with lots of fluffy towels and robes nearby. We had a corner room on the 4th floor facing the streets - thankfully, my hubby and son can sleep through anything so street noise and drunken revelers didn't bother them, but if you're a light sleeper bring earplugs as the noise lasts through the night. You can look out the french windows and watch the world go by (we witnessed a woman on a corner screaming/fighting with her boyfriend, then manhandled and thrown into a fast moving car, the car then sped off after making a squealing 5-point turn! lots of drama in the Quarter!) We loved how we were a few steps away from very good breakfast (Fleur de Lis cafe), and a few blocks away from nearly everything else of interest in the French Quarter. The room and hotel - the good: -big, luxurious bathrooms with nice amenities and robes (though robes were made of polyester) -very comfortable bed -although the room is not very big, there was just enough space for the 3 of us -beautifully lit courtyard at night- perfect for an evening drink or tea -complimentary coffee in the mornings -complimentary drop-off with their in-house Acura (took us to the local Budget car rental place) The bad: -mysterious stains on the carpet, duvet cover, and hallway carpets -the $14.95/day fee for wi-fi access -small desk area taken over by the big flat-screen TV, DVD player, and lamp -not enough storage space for our luggage and clothes (there was a small wardrobe, ie. no closet in room 420) -if you care about in-room coffee makers, there are none here -an inefficient toilet that took ages to flush Conclusion and tips: For those who can't normally afford staying in a W in NYC, Chicago, etc. do splurge in New Orleans - it's a lot cheaper and worth a try. We considered the larger W Hotel just west of Canal street but were happy to be in the more intimate setting of the Quarter. Try a lunch at Jager Bistro on Conti St. (4-5 blocks north of hotel). They serve great little German lunches and the BEST coffee concoctions anywhere in the Quarter. And if you like wheat beer this is the only place to find it close by.

We were greeted at the front desk by another friendly face, however, I do not remember his name. He advised us they have upgraded us to a nicer room as I am an SPG gold member but the room was not ready yet. It was about 11:00 am, so I did not expect the room to be ready. He did have another room available but recommended we wait for the one they selected for us since it was a better room. We decided to wait for the room and he indicated he would call us when it was ready. We walked around the French Quarter and had lunch at a mexican place that made the food right n front of you. I can't remember the name but it was on Decatur. While having lunch we were called and told that our room was ready. The room was very large with it's own private balcony which included a patio set. The bathroom enormous and the room was very clean. This was one of the best rooms I have stayed at in a while. We spent three days there checking out New Orleans and the French Quarter. Spend the money and take a carriage ride through the Quarter. If you share one, it will be cheaper. Every time we returned to the hotel, Troy remembered us and asked if there was anything we needed to just ask him. He was great. There are plenty of places to eat here. We did not try Bocca, at the hotel, as the food was not our kind of food. There is a great breakfast place right across the street much cheaper than the room service breakfast the hotel offers,. On our last night, we went to Dickie Brennan's steakhouse. I have eaten at a lot of steakhouses in my time and this was by far my favorite, It is rated one of the top ten in the US and i believe it.

Our room came with a wall mounted plasma flat screen t.v., with dvd player, stocked mini fridge & snacks ( not inclusive), cordless phone, internet access, Bliss bath products, safe & of course the gumball machine. I loved the fresh Birds Of Paradise in the hallways. We also liked the slate tiled, 2 person, stand alone shower, and seperate vanity area w/ extra wall mounted make up mirror in the bathroom.

The welcome area immediately sets the tone of the W as being a place that offers a classy club lounge feel.

The hotel is on Chartres Street and is conveniently located two blocks from Bourbon Street, two blocks from the riverfront, three blocks from Canal Street (and Harrahs), and 4 blocks from Jackson Square. We recommend walking to one of the nearby markets after check-in and stocking up on your own snacks and beverages. There is a mini-bar and fridge in the room, but why pay their prices? All of the little stores sell beer, wine and liquor, even the Walgreens nearby. You are more than welcome to bring your own beverages to sip in the courtyard or poolside. The ever-accomodating staff will happily keep your ice bucket full while you relax. There is regular bar service outside during the day also. W Hotels all have a young, contemporary \"shag-a-delic\" vibe to them, so if funky design that sometimes takes priority over practicality bothers you, don't stay at any W. But if you enjoy the novelty of it all and their attention to somewhat non-traditional details, you'll love it. This W is a renovated, traditional french quarter series of interconnected buildings which surround a huge and beautiful courtyard, complete with fountain, cabanas, soothing lighting, and pool. If you've never been to NOLA, pools are not a given at all hotels, nor is a courtyard, and this outdoor living area is large by most standards. We had standard hotel rooms on the 4th floor facing Chartres and we were surprised by how large the rooms were, because most rooms and especially bathrooms tend to be quite small due to traditional french quarter architecture. The bathrooms were actually quite large even by normal hotel standards, everything was clean and maintained (not perfect, but clean), and the beds are always heavenly. They do have onsite enclosed parking (for a fee, and parking is never cheap in NOLA) but we didn't use it. We booked online at SPG.com and did the prepaid rates which were around $170/night. We found all the staff to be friendly and the vast majority of them went out of their way to welcoming and accomodating. I've stayed at the Omni Royal Orleans and the Le Richileu in the past when visiting NOLA. While I'd return to anyone of them, the W was the perfect choice for our small group of thirty-something ladies. Most of us had stayed at 1 or more different W's in the past and we found this one to be the perfect blend of funky fresh W and New Orleans historic charm. Please note there are quieter places to stay, but this is to be expected in certain areas of the Quarter on a busy weekend. Being 2 blocks from a busy stretch of Bourbon and not far from busy Canal Street, this hotel is in one of those areas. It was quiet on Thursday and not bad Friday, but Saturday was pretty noisy from 11pm-4am (sirens, music, crowd noise, foot traffic). Being 2 blocks from a busy stretch of Bourbon and not far from busy Canal Street, this hotel is in one of those areas. They have an onsite restaurant Bacco by Brennan's which provided a wonderful poolside lunch one day, and handles all the hotel's room service.

It was also handicapped, so the shower was a big open area so you had to put towels over the floor to mop up the water while showering.

If you want a traditional hotel room, rectangular and with perhaps a terrace, they're in the building facing Chartres.

The gym is a healthy walk away at their sister hotel, the W New Orleans, but it's by far one of the largest and best furnished hotel fitness rooms I've encountered. I can't help you with their brand identity: it doesn't have the golly gee of the Chicago W's room design--\"I can see Lake Michigan from a secret window in my shower!\"-- and certainly doesn't have the quirky dorm rooms of the W San Diego.

It is not the typical W hotel with all the amenities, but it is small and charming and in the heart of the French Quarter. The Courtyard is terrific with a great lounge atmosphere and perfect for happy hour, evening cocktails, and gathering with friends. The pool is really just for looks, kind of murky and VERY small. I think the W hotel downtown is probably better equipped if a nice pool is what you are looking for. We stayed in a Spectacular Room which is bigger than a Wonderful Room and features a balcony. I wouldn't spend the money on this room if you are not planning to be in your room much. The balconies are not the charming French wrought iron balconies that you see in the suites and the ones on the street side (Conti) can be noisy. Not noisy with Mardi Gras revelers, but the garbage truck etc. We got a fan and the white noise muffled that somewhat. We switched to a Mega Room when one became available and the room was well worth the wait. These are old carriage houses that open to the courtyard and are much bigger than the other room types. They include a separate private courtyard with a hot tub and are very charming, exactly what you would expect from the French Quarter. However, the price tag on these can be high, so I would recommend this room if the difference in price between the Spectacular Room and Mega Room was less than $200 per night and you plan to relax near the hotel that day. If there is a lot of courtyard activity, there is a chance that could be disruptive, but there is a lot of white noise with the fan which blocks that out well, too. There are only 4 of these rooms in the hotel, though, so if you go hoping for an upgrade as part of a rewards program, don't count on it. The hotel staff is great, very helpful and attentive, checked on us several times, arranged a taxi at 5:30 in the morning, very nice. The restaurant is AWESOME, rivals Emerils but without the dress code and wait list! GREAT food!!

The hotel tries to go above and beyond with their \"Whatever/Whenever\" policy, however I felt that some basics were still overlooked. For instance, our room was not ready when we checked in at 3 and when we finally made it to our room, it looked like it had been hastily cleaned. The bedskirt was sloppy (see picture), there were crumbs left in the tray on the desk and the TV remote was missing from our room.

At $500 per night, you definitely expect accommodations to be better than average. We drove from the airport and easily found the hotel garage. The hotel is in a stellar spot in the French Quarter. We parked ($32 per day which included a $3 surcharge for the SUV Avis gave us) and checked into our rooms. Retrieving your car is quick. Cabs are pretty easy to catch too. We were given a room on the 2nd floor with a small balcony. Our room overlooked a vacant looking building and seemed like a nice quiet location. Our other party got a room over the internal courtyard of the hotel. The courtyard is very comfortable with a small swimming pool and lounge chairs. There is also a larger patio with many oversized chairs to relax and have a drink if you so choose. After returning from dinner I wanted to watch the ALCS (baseball). The TV had little or no reception and I couldn't even access the services channel that is normally available. The beds were very comfortable as they are at all W/Westins. The bathroom was very large and had a nice big shower with great water pressure. We soon learned that insulation and tightly sealed windows were not much of a consideration in the construction. The noise inside and outside the hotel is pretty loud. I recognize that NO is a party town, but to hear the people in the streets, courtyard, hallway like they were standing next to you was disconcerting. Our other party was kept awake most of the night. We were kept awake some of it. When we inquired about a quieter room, we were advised that these were two of the quieter rooms. To try and deal with the problem, we were told that white noise generators were available. We requested one and were told it would arrive shortly. It took no less than 5 requests and multiple visits to the front desk to get the machine. Between denial that it existed and a lack of understanding about how to get it, it was pretty frustrating. With the Saints in town, we were concerned that we would have another loud night. Fortunately, rain slowed down the revelers and it was much quieter. It was also a Sunday night. All in all, we probably wouldn't stay at this hotel again. The main reason is the amount of noise. The staff was very friendly and accommodating (except for the misunderstanding about the generator) and even allowed us to store some frozen seafood in their freezer for 2 days.

Obviously, I am very fond of this little hotel. I have the means to stay at any hotel in the city and consistently select this one. It may not be for everyone, but the mission of the W is to exude 'cool'...and it succeeds; from the understated decor of the hallways (I even love the hallways...always 'fresh' and the perfect temp) and rooms to the very polite staff to the beautiful little lobby to the awesome courtyard/pool area to the cool music and other special little touches. (There are times where the tasteful, comfortable courtyard/pool area is the place to be in the French Quarter, day or night, though it is never too crowded. Tip: Go to the cabanas upstairs in the courtyard in the evening and relax with a great view of the New Orleans skyline.) It seems like management and the staff do what they can to make everything special, unique, interesting...and cool. They are famous for their beds, for good reason; the absolutely most lush and comfortable sleep you'll ever find...hotel, home, wherever (my brother actually has purchased a set of their bedding). The glass enclosed walk-in showers are terrific, too. With less than 100 rooms, you almost feel like you are in an intimate apartment building, rather than a hotel. Last October, on Thursday nights they played a different 'horror' movie in the courtyard that was filmed in New Orleans. Great times...perfect weather under the stars with comfortable patio furniture surrounding the fountain with the fire, and eating wonderful Italian food from Bacco right there at the hotel that was delivered to our chases. (Though Bacco is good and run by the famous Brennan family, I would venture to other great restaurants in the FQ, including K-Paul's, Irene's, Cafe Giovanni, etc., etc.,...so many to choose from! If you will dine alone, I may suggest that you eat at the bar at Bacco.) This is a very good location: two blocks from Bourbon, two blocks from the Mississippi River, two blocks from the House of Blues, one block from the great restaurant K-Pauls. Parking is around $32, but it MAY be possible to find a legal spot on the street without a meter, but I wouldn't bet on it. If you're flying in, I'd do cabs, especially if you'll spend most of your time in the FQ. I hope you enjoy your trip wherever you end up in NOLA.

As with all W Hotels, they are very stylish and hip, from the decor to the staff. However, if you're expecting Ritz-Carlton/Four Seasons luxury, this is the not the place to be. The best thing about the hotel is the bed. Simply put, it is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. (So comfortable and desirable that we purchased the bed and its accessories for our house!) When you get into bed, you simply sink into the duvet, comforter, sheets and mattress cover. It's so comfortable that you don't want to get up in the morning! (It's similar to the Heavenly Bed at the Westin, but I think the W bed is better) The room itself is very modernly-outfitted, and a bit dark. The regular rooms are adequately-sized--not large, but not too small either. The deluxe rooms open out onto a balcony or walkway from large French doors. The bathroom is decorated in slate, and the bath products (Aveda) are wonderful. The lobby is a bit small, but in all fairness, how often are you in the lobby?

If things were a bit shabby, you'd be disappointed. Finally, another good thing about this hotel is its location. It's on Chartres, which is two blocks down and parallel to Bourbon. This is a good thing. With all the nuttiness going on on Bourbon Street until the wee hours of the morning, it is nice to be a bit farther away, and to enjoy the peace and quiet. In the many years we've been coming to New Orleans during Halloween weekend (a very nutty and crowded weekend), the W French Quarter is a nice peaceful oasis away from the crazy, swirling French Quarter. So long as you don't expect 5-star luxury, you'll thoroughly enjoy this hotel.", "Date": "January 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City", "Title": "\u201cGreat Experience at the W\u201d", "Author": "BB in KC", "ReviewID": "UR2872334", "Content": "We just returned from a business trip and stayed at the W. Great experience! The W is a happening place. Staff were friendly and helpful. We used their meeting room and were throughly impressed with great service and an environment conducive to work (including wi-fi for our laptops). I definitely recommend for board meetings and business gatherings. Front desk was great to work with and helped us with restaurant recommendations and reservations. They also managed to find us an out of the way fan boat tour in the bayou which was a great experience. The rooms are terrific with signature W beds. Very comfortable. And my room had the best shower I've ever had in a hotel. There is some street noise from Chartres St., but come on! It's New Orleans! Highly recommend the W!

The bed, glass shower, huge bathroom and Aveda products are heaven. It is fairly close to everything in the French Quarter, the Aquarium and Harrah's. The only thing I would recommend if you stay here is to request a room that does NOT face Chartres Street, as the street noise is terrible (garbage trucks woke us up every morning at 4AM). Also, if you expect your room to be cleaned every day you will be disappointed. We had a 4 night stay and our room was only cleaned once, but the staff was very prompt and helpful; when we called the front desk to request anything they brought it immediately. They were also very helpful with directions and restaurant suggestions. Another recommendation: the restaurant attached to the hotel (Bacco) was not very good. Extremely bland food; there are so many great places to eat in New Orleans, don't waste your money there!", "Date": "August 23, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "W New Orleans - French Quarter", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d123524-Reviews-W_New_Orleans_French_Quarter-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html", "Price": "$208 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">316 Chartres St</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New Orleans</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">LA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">70130</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "123524", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/98/8f/90/filename-model-room-jazz.jpg"}}
