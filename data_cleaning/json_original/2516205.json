I have spent years of my mundane life in this world, specifically during my time in public schools. I spent 3 nights here recently, where a friendly desk clerk and efficient housekeeper crafted a 79.5% achievement for their establishment, if I've a grader - B-. Big points vanished with the missing amenities (out-of-order snack machine, for example, was the only one available) and grounds keeping ( big orange cones in the cactus garden). Other flaws, that could be remedied easily are worn-down carpeting and older, tube-style televisions. A standard continental breakfast offered nothing original. Perhaps the addition of a local citrus item would add a touch of thoughtfulness? No arguing with waffle makers, powdered eggs, fruit loops and coffee with creamer in those little white plastic tubs that say mini-moos. (Other stuff like muffins and bagel and yogurt are offered.) The swimming pool is pretty small. The outdoor hot tub is good; its tiled and the jets are well-placed. A Circle K and a paved, walking/biking trail known as \"The Greenway,\" lie within super-easy walking distance. The parking situation requires one to walk through a tunnel, and around an elevator, staircases and landscaping to get to a room. The small goldfish pond had no fish or visible life other than algae and appeared half-full (I'm being optimistic here, get it?) We chose this location for its proximity to the friends and relatives we visited. For 50-odd bucks you'll find some decent stretch-out area in a double-bed room. The bathroom provides ample space, has nice light (not those dial-timed sunlamps that always made me wonder why motel bathrooms needed to be equipped with them), a large, clean mirror and standard tub. Problem is, VERY LOW WATER PRESSURE and a faucet that would be one level below a Rubiks Cube, in terms of successfully operating. A note on the shower wall (!) explains how to use it.. something to do with radio dials; don't ask. Not to mention, the water took awhile to heat up. Yet, looking at the bright side.. friendly, efficient lobby staff and housekeepers allowed us to enjoy our stay!

Instead, we were surprised it was an attractive and very safe neighborhood with lots of stores and restaurants.

The so-so--microwave was ancient and noisy, the bathroom was adequate but outdated. 2nd room off street rooms were quiet enough which is what i had, but could see that street rooms or courtyard rooms by pool could be noisier.

The not so good--the parking area is in back and a little creepy for a single woman--twice there was someone (probably staff) sitting in a vehicle when I pulled up. Other reviewers were correct that anyone off the street could be walking back there. Could be a lot better lit also. Also, the TV channel selection was very subpar--no local channel for news/weather--very bizarre. Instead lots of cartoons, comedy and MTV...

Based on several friends recommending the La Quinta chain, I chose this one, which was near our friend's house. From the description on the website, it fit our budget and had the amenities we were looking for, so we figured it would be a good place to stay. I booked the room by calling the hotel directly and actually got a better price than what I'd found at various travel websites. The woman who took my reservation was friendly and helpful. And when we arrived there in person, we got an even *better* rate. Indeed it worked out for us well. The lobby is nice and welcoming, the hotel is in an area that has convenient shopping nearby, and our room had several 'extras' that made staying there nice. It's not an ultra swanky gourmet hotel, nor is it a scary fleabag hotel. It's a nice, standard, middle ground place, which felt clean, welcoming and affordable. In our room, which had two double beds, was a little fridge, a microwave, a coffee maker with coffee & supplies provided, and a nice large closet. I liked the fact that the hotel gives you the option of not having your bed linens washed daily, if you so choose, in order to save water. The bathroom seemed standard enough. The usual soaps and tiny shampoos were supplied, and basic towels. Though we never used the microwave, it was nice to know we *could* have used it if we needed it, and we did use the fridge and the coffeemaker. I have to say though, bring your own coffee if you care at all about what your coffee tastes like. This coffee just didn't cut it for us. This is because we like to drink really, really good coffee. Still, though, it was nice to have. The beds were ok, but not the best--they were a bit slanty. But they were comfortable enough. I think all of us wished we'd brought our own pillows, too, but we're picky pillow people. The pillows supplied ranged from really flat to somewhat poofy, so if you're particular, you may want to bring your own. Other perks included the outdoor heated pool and jacuzzi tub. We *definitely* made use of that jacuzzi both nights we were there, and it really made our stay. It was one reason we chose that place--we wanted a place with a jacuzzi. It was large and clean. We didn't use the pool, but it looked nice. There was also a workout room, but according to my friends who used it, it wasn't the greatest. The treadmill seemed old and cranky. The free continental breakfast was nice--especially because you can make your own fresh waffles. There are two waffle irons and premixed batter and someone standing there to help if you don't know how to work the iron. They were quite nice. Also provided are fresh fruits, cereals, packaged muffins and pastries, breads for toast, juices (from a machine, but ok enough), and the aforementioned weak coffee.
