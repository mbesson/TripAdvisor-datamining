Facilities are excellent - everything seems new and with a nice design. Breakfast was really delicous - much better than in most 5 stars hotels that I stayed at (personally I do recomend chocolate cake:)) What I did not like was the localization - it was not so far from the city center (around 20 minutes by local trains), but the area looks dirty and dangerous and also way form the train station to the hotel is not convenient - you need to use old footbridge which is not the best if you have heavy luggage. In general good value for money.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "johannesburg", "Title": "\u201cspotless\u201d", "Author": "ulysses64", "ReviewID": "UR119941563", "Content": "The Roma Point Hotel is unlike any other in Rome. My family and I stayed there for a week in September 2011. Everything they say about it is true. It is rather modern, trendy and clean. It is also difficult to find (even for somebody like me who is from Rome!) and rather far from downtown. The train station, however, isn't far away and the ride to Piazzale Flaminio, at the bottom of Via del corso is only 15 minutes. I would NOT reccommend doing the trip at night, though. Overall it was excellent value for money (we did have a car) although breakfast nedds serious improvement (I really think that the fruit salad should NEVER come out of a can!)", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coventry, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTHIS IS A TOUGH ONE TO CALL.......\u201d", "Author": "tillyturtle", "ReviewID": "UR118726330", "Content": "This hotel is very trendy, the rooms are very clean, the bathrooms are huge and have all toiletres, The breakfast is average and the staff are ok. The location is far away from the centre of rome however if you dont mind getting a train and metro (only for 1euro each way) then you have actually found yourself a little retreat. If you wish to see rome by night and explore the evenings rome has to offer this hotel is not for you as the train station and the street look highly unsafe to walk around after 8pm. we are quite adventoures and are happy to walk anywere and everywere just not from the trainstation to the hotel at night,the path its blocked in as the trainline runs one side and a huge hedge next to a bust highway is the other, its not safe! yet there is a very italian restuarnt next door (there not the friendlest bunch but my god its very cheap and does good food) so you can enjoy a meal and a few drinks and also the minibar in the room at the hotel is cheap so you can get by. BE AWARE there is nothing else at all in the area. DO NOT BOOK A TAXI FROM THE AIRPORT TO THE HOTEL - ours didnt arrive we rang the hotel and nobody answered so when we eventually arrived we complained and it took them a day to refund us after i said it wasnt good enough there excuse was that they just ring a taxi for us my argument was thier website says they provide a shuttle service after a day they finally owned up and gave us the money back, did i mention the taxi we had to get in the end was 70euros. the taxi drivers werent happy they had to drive that far away. I am still confused about this hotel i think rome is expanding and soon enough this hotel will fall in the rome area however i think the hotel is ahead as there is nothing else for tourists to do. if you go to the hotel just be prepared to travel a bit more (remember its only 1euro each way) and be home early at night unless your brave enough. to sum up i would stay here again if i was on a budget and wanted somewere decent to put my head down at the end of a long day and didnt mind being a bit isolated (especially now i know the area) I wouldnt stay here if i wanted to experiance everything rome has to offer day and night.

Via Flaminia is a very long street. Directions: from down town(Piazza del Popolo) the best solution is to take the train up until Flaminia station(10-15 min max). 1euro cost the ticket per person and can be bought from the reception.

The location is exceptionally clean, the staff is very friendly (and they all understand English) and the area that the hotel is located in a very quiet and nice area. They also offer a lot of amentities, which are already set up in your room. They are toothbrushes, toothpaste, shaving cream, razor, cotton swabs, cotton pads and slippers. The fact that the hotel is very clean and looks very new is also a plus. The beds were very comfortable and the room we booked was very spacious. Free internet was included in the past, but they are now charging 3 Euros an hour for internet. Also, keep in mind they do not have Wi-Fi at this area. There are not a lot of places to eat in this area, but if you happen to take the 232 bus to the Flaminia district, there are a lot of restaurants in that area to choose from. If you are traveling by public transportation from the airport, it is very confusing. My suggestion is to take the Metro A going to in the Battisini direction and getting off at Flaminio Station (Which is 4 stops). As you exit the subway, head over to Flaminio Station and take anyone of the trains going in the direction of Viterbo. Your stop for the hotel will be at Grotta Rossa Station not Du Pointe. Once you get off of Grotta Rossa Station, take the exit on your left. The left exit is a ramp that will lead you down a path and will curve to the right. That path will take you to an overpass, which you will cross to get to the other side of the freeway. Once you get to the other side, take the street located behind the overpass to the hotel. The walk will take less then 7 minutes. The hotel will be located on your left side.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middlesex", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel on the outskirts of Rome\u201d", "Author": "Maenapiza", "ReviewID": "UR109191634", "Content": "The Roma Point Hotel is just outside the capital in a suburban area called (Grottarossa) is undoubtedly the latest example of the return of Italy\u2019s own three-star matches. Location: The only way the public approaches the hotel is the railway north of Rome, with dilapidated carriages and stations from the post war period with signs and ill-marked trails that wind through underbrush memory of the Amazon. At night the road between the station and the hotel ( which is approximately 5min walk) is deserted and looks a bit dangerous. Hotel Roma Point appears to be a more than excellent solution for a diverse audience. Returning to the structure, modern in style, you will have the opportunity to stay in good size rooms, furnished with good taste in furniture that is in the coating bath and bedroom and with beds that friends overseas would call a king-size bed, enjoy a relaxing shower in the box where you set up a dual union, one hard rain, the other mobile jet freely adjustable temperature and flow rate. Simple and cheap is the inevitable mini-bar that looks like a mini window immediately opposite the entrance, below and next to the lock of the safe-cabinet with hangers, drawers and cupboards.
