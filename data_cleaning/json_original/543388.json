We booked the loft room with the extra bedroom with twin beds. Myself, my husband and 3 yr old. The room was fantastic - plenty of room, clean, comfortable beds, nice bathroom but there were a couple of cons that brought this down from an execellent score. 1. TV in main room had 1 channel - remote didnt work 2. TV in twin bed room had only german channels - remote broken 3. Water in shower was luke warm 4. machine issuing entrance cards for room was broken so everytime we wanted to go in or out of our room we needed an escort from reception 5. wifi available but signal so low that you cannot connect to internet 6. very noisy (to be expected I suppose given location) but still very noisy so bring earplugs if you want to sleep 7. REception upon checkout didnt ask us how our stay was or thanks or anthing really - Most people wont care about the TV when in the Centre of BCN but I wanted it and was fed up not being able to zap.

There are plus and minuses to be aware of.\u201d", "Author": "Andrew Z", "ReviewID": "UR122920459", "Content": "This is an apart hotel. Some very good features and some not. Was ok for us, but may not be suitable for other visitors. See below. Pluses: - very good customer service. I would say one of the best I've ever seen. - very clean and maintained. - very good location from sightseeing and dining out prospective - located just in the center. a walking distance from almost all points of itnerest in the central Barcelona. Also its good the hotel is not based on La Rambla (one of central streets in Barcelona, which is too crowdy, too 'tourist' and full of pickpocketers). The location is quite and there is a two corner shops one 10 m away from hotel, another 15m away. The location is in Latin quarter (not in Gothic area as some people write, though very close to it), which means not crowded. Few fantastic restaraunts around. - the rooms are quite good like you would see in a decent 4* hotel, large (they've upgraded us to suite, which we really appreciate). Nice contemporary design plus old 18 century wooden beams left exposed. Kitchen is very useful for travelling with a kid. Minuses: - VERY low ceilings in some places. The main room had very high ceilings but bedroom, hall and the bathroom have them very low, while the doorways are extremely low. I've physically hit my head few times quite bad. I am 1,92m (6,3ft) tall and this was sort of an issue. - Very slow internet connection. Wi-Fi is free but, it is powered by Telefonica, a local mobile provider and it is very slow and connects not always at once. It is so slow so you can forget about things like Youtube there for instance or graphic iPad apps. Ok for simple websites. Also the signal is quite week (we stayed on 3rd floor of 4), and it didn't work in all areas of the suite all time. - No public areas. the hotel is very small only few rooms, so there is no restaraunt, bar, gym and etc. Corridors and elevator are very narrow. I've heard there is like a pool on the roof, but we obviously couldn't use it in January. - The area. Though it is good location from walking prospective, a half a minute walk from large street called Via Laeitana, we couldn't look through the windows - the distance to other houses was just a bit over one meter. You also almost never see sunlight, so the room was always in a dark with curtains down. Was a bit annoying after few days like that. The areas and streets are quite dirty in that area, this isn't a tourist quarter but still seems like a place for cheaper accomodation and there are few bars on that street, which are very low profile. Also the noise proof in rooms is low.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice apartment-style rooms in great location\u201d", "Author": "willcarson", "ReviewID": "UR122268698", "Content": "We booked this hotel after reading good reviews on TripAdvisor and we weren't disappointed.

We already knew to get directions ahead of time, based on our experience with the pre-cruise apartment (FGA Bach). We had two taxi's because we shopped til we dropped at the ports. They also dropped us on the main street, stating that they couldn't go down the narrow alley. Luckily it was 10:00 am, so we didn't have to worry about the purse snatchers that others wrote about. There was a reception area with a very nice lady working. She was quite upset with the taxi drivers for dropping us on the corner. The main reception area was really nice, but it smelled like sewage. The lift was extremely small, but the room/loft was really nice. We loved the location of the little hotel because it was walking distance to everything. We walked through the gothic quarters, to Las Ramblas, and took the Metro to the rest of the hot spots. Don't let the grafitti bother you in the pictures because there is grafitti everywhere in Barcelona...I mean EVERYWHERE! The hotel made sure there were two taxi's waiting for us in the morning to take us to the airport. The hotel let us use their phone to make a call home to the states, and we didn't have any problems going out late at night for dinner. There were a couple of small things with our loft, the windows in the main room looks out on a pigeon infested alley, but the smaller room didn't. Yes, the rooms are quite dark even with the small lights they have. Lastly, the ceiling over the steps down to the main sitting area is VERY low.

Firstly finding the place proved difficult as there is no sign outside it that shows that it is a hotel. Our taxi from the airport refused to take us down what amounts to a dark alley and so we walked with our rolling luggage and child in a pushchair into what can only be described as 'harms way'. We walked straight past the hotel (as there was nothing obvious to show what it was) and on into the dark depths. We saw a street cleaner and asked directions from her (she sent us completely the wrong way as it turned out - probably deliberately). I eventually asked a cafe owner where we were (I had a map but there were no street signs). The cafe owner said that I was in the wrong part of town and to get out fast, he pointed at several feral looking men and said they were thieves! We took his advice and went for the nearest main street, we were followed by a couple of sinister looking chaps in dark glasses and designer clothes. By now I was boiling hot and very concerned. One of the men made a move to get my wifes handbag but she had the presence of mind not to be distracted. We finally found the place and the security entry is a sure sign that the hotel owners are aware what a dangerous place this is. Although it is in the Born area and close to everything, it is seedy in it's immediate location. The reception lady was very polite and professional and friendly and seemed genuinely shocked when I described our experience of finding them. She told us that she leaves work at 11pm and has never had any bother. The hotel is tiny and has no amenities - no restaurant or bar, it was a squash to get into the lift with just one suitcase. There is no way a disabled person could manage at this place. For a hotel that only opened in 2005, it seems extraordinary for that to be the case. The room (a junior suite) was located on the first floor. Spacious and achingly trendy it was as the saying goes, \"all fur coat and no knickers\". There was a complimentary welcome half bottle of cava in an ice bucket with a few chocolates on the coffee table. The electrics were quite dodgy and the TV was wired into the bedside lamps, so no lamp on meant no TV! The tiny bathroom had no bath! I had to walk sideways into the shower it was so small and I'm not that big..really. The lightswitch for the bathroom (which was up a couple of steps) was behind a heavy glass door. Totally bad design. The cupboards were tatty and on their last legs. This place needs a total rethink and after just three years it already needs a refurbishment. There was no tea or coffee but a reasonably well stocked mini-bar / fridge. A couple of the windows (covered by heavy wooden shutters) were nailed shut and you needed to have several lights on otherwise the room would be in permanent semi darkness. Great if you want to sleep but very gloomy otherwise. Our room was over a side alleyway and the noise was terrible. Every word spoken would echo up and could be heard by us, mopeds and motorbikes constantly buzzing up and down, delivery lorries clattering about and our sleep was completely ruined every night. I love Barcelona and wanted to be close to the main areas but made a big mistake with the hotel Boria. It is very expensive and simply not worth the money. It is in completely the wrong street . I would not stay there again and would urge anyone else not to make my mistake as you will regret it.

A perfect choice for honeymooners with its luxurious and spacious rooms. I found the hotel through a hotel booking site, but since I prefer to book directly at the hotel I did so through their webpage, and it worked very well. I hade some questions before placing the booking and they replied quickly and placing the booking directly at the hotel felt secure. On arrival we hade complimentary cava and chocolates, a very nice touch when on your honeymoon, even thou we knew it wasn\u2019t something special just for us, but that kind of thing really shows it\u2019s a hotel that take pride in the details. Just as always having fresh flowers in the room, changed every third day. And it was fun to se the bed done in different ways almost every day. ;-) The staff was very friendly and helpful, and yes, the guy working the nightshift is just there for security, not as a receptionist. We loved the little kitchenette, one of the reasons for booking the hotel since I have a medical condition making me have to eat very regular and have all that space to prepare easy dishes and a fried and freezer (whit free ice, nice touch to) made it possible to have the ingredient fresh and chilled. The only downside was that the cooker didn\u2019t work (it was not broken, just not in use) and that was a pity I think. Wonder why there were installed when one couldn\u2019t use them. Maybe it hade something to do with security and insurances. You really should take advantage of the fact that you have one of the nice markets (mercat de santa caterinia) just a block away and go there and by fruit, hams, cheeses and prepare a lovely breakfast in your room. And the dishwasher was a nice surprise, no need to take any washing liquid or sponges whit you if you are used to that when renting an apartment. This is a hotel apartment, with all the service. But there could have been one ore two more channels on the telly for us English speaking. Even thou we went there to watch telly, its nice to have it on when eating breakfast and while preparing to go out. After 10 days, you are feed up with news, I promise you. The location is highly central, I and don\u2019t understand how anyone wants to live at La Rambla when you can stay in El Born and La Ribiera. Most things is within walking distains and we found that taking the tube often took to more time than walking directly. But fore the times when you are to go a but further in the city, for example up to Park G\u00fcrel or Montju\u00efc, you have a tube station just around the corner. We highly recommend eating one of your meals on the restaurant Petit Safr\u00e0 just by the market. Easy, well cooked food to a nice price. We eat there on our first night after recommendation from the receptionist and we returned on our last night as well. When you want to enjoy a real good seafood platter, go to Can Ramonet in the Baceloneta, but whatever you do, pleas just go pass the very nice looking restaurants that you pass on the way there from the hotel at the Historic Museum. The look nice, but the food is that as great as the d\u00e9cor and it\u2019s heavily overpriced. Instead, wonder down in El Born and eat at one of the modern restaurants there, bestiari for example is a very nice one.", "Date": "January 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Boutique Hotel - Would do it again\u201d", "Author": "datvader", "ReviewID": "UR11505535", "Content": "Found Boria at the last minute and it was a great find. The location was great as we much prefer El Born vibe to Las Ramblas. That being said, it was a 15 minutes to Las Ramblas so you're actually very centrally located. Also, the street that it's located on is very quiet which was a plus for a good sleep. The rooms were fantastic, much more than I expected. You could easily fit 4 people in the room we stayed in. there was a separate bedroom with a Queen bed (so actually two Queens), a kitchen, a small terrace, and the decor was tasteful and modern. The staff was very nice though they may not be as knowledgeable as some of the larger hotels. But it's a boutique hotel so it has that smaller, cozy feel.

My requirements when looking were as follows; room to accomidate a family of 4, A/C, and close to major sights. We stayed here twice in July, pre and post cruise First in room 201, 2nd in room 303. Both rooms were huge and beautiful. The decor was sleek and modern, with old world architecture (just like Barcelona) We liked 201 a little better as it had a seperate living room. Both had similar colors. The beds were very comfy and the A/C worked well. We did not hear any noise that others spoke of. It was really nice having the extra space. It was full of extra touches like fresh flowers in 3 rooms, welcome chocolates and champagne. Staff were warm and friendly and spoke great english. I have nothing negative to say regarding this place and would definetly stay here again. However this hotel may not be for everyone. For one we could never get a taxi to drop us off directly in front of the hotel, They always dropped us of at a cross street and we would walk about 150 yards.( If you have alot of luggage this could be a problem) No bellman , again those of you who over pack just know that you must carry those bags up 5 stairs by yourself to reach a very tiny elevator. The 2 rooms we stayed in also had stairs. They were beautful freestanding wood stairs without handrails or lighting, so if you have mobility problems, or you forget they are there chances are good of falling down them, especially in the middle of the night. No , this did not happen to me, but I could see it happening. The cab ride from the hotel to the airport for 4 people and 4 bags was 25 euros.

We stayed in Room 402 and by European standards the suite was quite roomy. The location was absolutely perfect and the rooftop terraces gave all of us a good place to wind down before the 9:00 PM dinner hour. My only complaint is that there wasn't a place inside the hotel to have coffee. There was a coffee maker in the room, but I missed the morning continental breakfast that so many European hotels offer. I would definitely stay there again. The staff was very helpful. They booked a Flamenco dinner and show for us. The hotel was within walking distance of everything and the Jaume metro stop is a block away. A visit to CalPep was wonderful.

There's also a metro station right across the street. We came and went at all hours of the day and night and never once felt unsafe. We stayed on the fourth floor in a junior suite (room 402) and thought that our room was great, with it's high, wood beamed ceilings, king-sized bed, small kitchen area, extra bedroom, and nice sized bathroom. The fact that we were on the fourth floor also helped to cut down on some of the street noise (though given its location you have to expect a little clatter). We also enjoyed the roof top terrace and finished off most of our evenings enjoying the night air while finishing our final glasses of wine. In addition, all the staff at the hotel were friendly and courteous. Given the hotel's amenities and location we felt that the price we paid for our stay was extremely reasonable.

The kitchenette was nice but the oven never worked. Didn't care... like we were going to cook anything but it was a nice option. Fridge came in handy but don't use any of their mini bar products... there is a mini food mart a few buildings down for .80 water and 4 euro wine.

Only a short walk to Princessa Street for great little restaurants, bars, shops, and the Picasso Museum. Short walk to the old city and the cathedral. Metro is only a block away. Felt reasonably safe during our stay. Think we heard an attempted purse snatching around 0300 on a FRI night, but that is pretty common throughout the entire city. Staff was great and helpful.

You don't get just a room or suite, you get a full-size apartment - stylish, modern, with contemporary art everywhere, a kitchen with large fridge, freezer, dishwasher etc. And this at the best location in town. This IS a real hotel, although it has 10 \"rooms\" (apartments) only - with 24h-reception, full room service, newspapers in the lobby (British, German and French) and a well-stocked library. They even have a terrace on the roof. Location: The BoriaBCN is at the best location of town, just steps away from the Cathedral and the Picasso Museum. The next Metro station is 50 meters away. If you have a car (not exactly advisable in Barcelona), there is parking garage also 50 meters away from the hotel. The hotel is on a rather quiet side street, however you are in a mediterranean city with people active until midnight - but no traffic, and after midnight it becomes quiet. The BoriaBCN is at the edge of El Born, just in the middle between the Barrio Gothico and the Born. Just around the corner (Princesa and Argenteria) you find lots of trendy bars and restaurants. We did a lot of walking deep in the night and found it always safe. Rooms: See the pictures. Everything is incredibly spacious (even the shower!), brand new, bright and shining. We spend five days in this hotel, and all five days it was heavily raining in Barcelona. You can imagine how happy we were in this huge apartment. We liked to prepare breakfast and lunch on the room, and fridge, microwave and dishwasher helped a lot. Public areas: This is a small boutique hotel that does not have much public space. The lobby is a kind of library with books about travel, art, design and cooking (several languages). They have a nice roof terrace and we would have liked to use it if it hadn't rained to much. Service: Impeccable maid service. Very friendly and helpful receptionists. The do not serve breakfast in the hotel, but there are several breakfast places just around the corner. Value: We stayed with our family of 4 in a larger suite and, given the high price level of hotels in barcelona, found it extremely economical - regarding the degree of luxury which we enjoyed.
