The public areas were very clean and tastefully decorated, as was the room (number 10). Indeed the hotel appeared as if it had been renovated fairly recently. Our room faced the road, but the windows were double glazed and we did not notice any undue noise. The bedroom was of a good size, for Paris, with separate bathroom and toilet. Very clean, nicely decorated and with antique style wardrobe and chest of drawers, the latter with a marble top. The bathroom was compact, but perfectly functional and clean. The bar on the ground floor is not particularly functional, as it is really nothing more than a drinks cupboard. However minutes sways there are multiple brasseries open til late, which are a great place to sit and chill at the end of an evening. Eiffel Tower is ten minutes walk. Champs Elysee is about 20 mins walk. Nearest Metro is a few minutes walk - Ecole Militaire. Top Tips: 1) we didn't try breakfast as there were a number if local brasseries nearby offering goods deals on breakfast at sensible prices, and with a good ambiance. I recommend Rue Cher, a few minutes walk from the hotel. Try the PTT brasserie - 6 euros for continental breakfast or 8 euros for American (lots of Americans seems to holiday in the area). 2) for dinner, again Rue Cher is a good place to look. A good ambiance and list of choice at sensible (by Parisian standards) prices. Just off Rue Cher, in Rue de Grenelle, there is a small Italian restraint called Di Felice. I can highly recommend it. Excellent 'real' Italian food, fresh pasta, freshly cooked and again at a sensible price. Also a nice small restaurant ambiance. 3) don't spend 14 euros a person on a one hour Seine river boat tour. Spend a few more euros (18) and you can get a two day pass for the Batobus which you can use on a hop on hop off basis for a full two days. OK you don't get someone in a microphone telling you the sights, but to be honest any basic guide book and map would tell you more. 4) book you Eiffel tour tickets online before you arrive. The queues are incredibly long, but if you book in advance you can bypass them. 5) Parisian taxis can be hard to come by. When you leave the hotel, it can be difficult for the hotel to get a pre-booking. The taxi will only come if the hotel call at the time you need it. Cut yourself some slack timewise when you leave, especially if you want a taxi to take you outside the Paris metro area.", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Basel, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Hotel, the location and staff.\u201d", "Author": "Swisslife2011", "ReviewID": "UR102761789", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Le Tourville.

Our room had very comfortable queen size bed, with two single beds for our kids in what might be called an \"adjoining\" type of room. The decor was rustic and beautiful. Noise was minimal, even though you're in the general vicinity of the Eiffel Tower and Les Invalides. The bathroom was colossal and our kids LOVED the whirlpool. And after a day touring all over the city of Paris, that whirlpool can be a godsend. The 7th Arrt. is a great location in general. You can catch the metro at the Ecole Militaire stop and go just about anywhere. Of course, the breakfast prices were over the top at the hotel itself, so we went to many cafes in the area, which presented a much better value. I highly recommend going to the nearby Rue Cler, which Rick Steves justifiably obsesses about in his Paris books -- it's a wonderfully homey and very French street with all kinds of food shops and stores, cafes and restaurants. Each guest not only has a small safe in their room, but there is an additional safe for you in the lobby in which only you have the key to it. Speaking of keys, the keys to the room are quite huge and elegant, and thankfully, the front desk takes them before you leave for the day! There are two people who were especially helpful to us during our stay -- Alexandra and David. They will help book restaurants for you even before you arrive there.

(yes, rooms are not the greatest, but the location premium pays for itself the first day!) - I will make only one suggestion to the owners.

David arranged for commercial tours to Bruges and to the champagne country, a Bateaux Parisiens dinner cruise on the Seine, restaurant reservations, taxi to the airport, and solved any wifi problem. He was patient, knowledgeable, friendly and always professional. Anne Marie served our breakfast daily with exceptional skill. She was friendly yet professional and always remembered our preferences. All of these people were delights and enhanced our trip beyond description. The location is extremely well situated, Near Rue Cler, a daily market street with cafes, cheese, wine, fish, vegetable and fruit vendors.

The location is perfect - just walk around the corner and you can see the Eiffel Tower!

My partner was too scared to go to the summit - I went but I am scared of heights and found the lift a bit harrowing but the view is so worth it! Many people were dressed up as Michael Jackson with music playing under the tower - due to the recent sad news. A great atmosphere I never felt unsafe - there are the usual people trying to flog badly-made Eiffel towers, roses and champagne concealed in jackets. Police toured the area regularly. We dined at the restaurants close to the hotel both for breakfast and dinner. The food was supberb but be aware you will be paying for it! eight euros for a bottle of Heineken, coke and orange juice was six euros. Staying in this area means it will be expensive to eat/drink but if you don't mind walking you will save on travel costs. As has already been mentioned there is a Metro station just around the corner. We bought 10 Metro tickets for 11 euros and this was enough for our weekend between two of us. The hotel itself is charming - small rooms (normal in Paris) with toiletries and a view over the avenue and good air conditioning. The only odd thing about the roomwas that a double wardrobe faced the bed with the flat screen tv being located at the side - this meant only one person could see the fulls creen - we found this a bit idd but with the size of the room there was probably no where else to site it. There were very friendly and helpful staff who spoke back to me in english after I attempted some very poor french! DO NOT rely on staff for travel help though! I asked for a taxi the night before we were due to catch a coach to Beauvais airport. I was assured this would be arranged. We waited this morning in reception when the lady told us actually \"you can't book them in rush hour and oh it seems to not be here, I can try them in ten minutes....\" hmmm, bit of a risk. She suggested we take the 92 bus which goes direct to Porte Malliot....got on the bus, all the stops listed on the wall -Porte Malliot was not one of them!!!! This resulted in a mad dash on foot from the Arc de Triomphe luggage in hand in a bit of a panic! We got there in time thankfully. If travelling from Beauvais getting the coach is by far the easiest way to get into Paris - there were no taxis waiting at the airport, just coaches so it seemed the obvious solution - thirteen euros each one-way.

My husband and I verbally confirmed this when we checked in. However, the front of hotel staff was horribly misinformed and insisted, rudely, that we settle the bill. I was terribly insulted, and embarrassed as I was unable to explain the situation given that the staff member was rather unapproachable. Repeated attempts to contact the hotel to have the charge reversed and simply put onto my daughters credit card as pre arranged have been ignored.

The terrace was completely overshadowed by the tall buildings only feet away around it that made it cold, dark and uninviting - we didn't use it.

The first night, our second story room did not have A/C so they provided a fan, which served well. However, when they could not fix the A/C on the following day they moved us into a (larger) room on the first floor. We preferred the higher floor, but A/C was more important since it was in August. Only problem with this room is that it is directly behind the reception desk in the lobby and the person there has a chair that scrapes every time they move it -- we suggest to the hotel management that they get a chair with wheels or put the one they have on a rug or carpet -- a fairly easy fix to make the customers in that room happier!!

Tips for any one planning on staying here: There IS ice in the lobby - just ask for it; the windows are very well insulated as far as keeping the noise out which we very much appreciated; several excellent cafes within two blocks; L'Open Tour bus stop only about one-and-a-half blocks away (you can almost use this as your \"local\" bus with a several-day pass, which is what we did); there is a bodega-type store a few doors down from the hotel entrance when you want some cheap eats/drinks; we had breakfast brought to our room in the mornings, and it was MORE than adequate and brought at exactly the time we had requested. Another suggestion for the management: Install some type of partition at the shower head end of the tub, a glass wall would work well.

The staff was most accommodating, especially Charlotte \u2013 who made an error in the reservations so my son had to have the basement room the first night but we were not charged. She was so apologetic. (The room wasn\u2019t a bad size but it didn\u2019t have a window and my son said it was noisy in the morning while they were serving breakfast.) The next day, they moved his bag to his new room while we were out sightseeing. (And they did have a porter for our things when we arrived.) One of the ladies was actually upset that she didn\u2019t remember which room our son was in so she didn\u2019t have his key ready! The next room my son had was a standard room on the ground floor. It was a nice size and there were bars on the window for security. Peggy was also helpful. She recommended the water taxi which is a nice alternative to the metro, though we used the metro a lot because the stop was so close to the hotel. We ate at nearby restaurants most of the time. The Indian Restaurant next to the hotel, in particular was very good. It served the best chicken curry ever. Rue Cler is a very quaint area to walk around in. There is also a launder-mat on the way to the metro, next to the bank, should anyone need to wash a few things and the post office is also nearby. The two minor minuses: the hairdryer was almost pointless \u2013 it was hot, but it didn\u2019t really blow. And, of course, no shower curtain \u2013 but this is common so hardly worth mentioning. Believe me, I will always recommend this hotel to anyone I know going to Paris \u2013 I hope we get to go back!", "Date": "June 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, Texas", "Title": "\u201cA real winner\u201d", "Author": "Ortrude", "ReviewID": "UR5378989", "Content": "We recently spent 15 nights at this lovely hotel.

The rooms are small - but so what? They are neat, well-maintained and cheerful. Breakfast is simple but more than sufficient. The staff was always attentive and ready to assist. Because there are only 30 or so rooms in the building, the staff, particularly the front desk staff, quickly learn the faces and names of those staying more than a couple of nights. This creates a feeling that you live here, and are not simply renting a room for a few days. Myself and my traveling companion each requested early check-in on our arrival and were greeted with rooms ready at 9 AM.

We dined within a few blocks of the hotel each evening and we highly suggest you seek the recommendations of the hotel staff. All references were excellent. Tourville's location was perfect for strolling over to the eiffel tower after dinner which we really enjoyed. The breakfast room was cozy and very tidy during our stay. The bread products were perhaps not the freshest, but we enjoyed the ability to dine in prior to heading out for the day. We paid for convenience, however, if you are looking for quality, you may prefer to dine elsewhere in the morning. For our next visit, we will book a Superior room as the Standard double is TINY...barely any space to walk with luggage. We attempted to upgrade upon arrival (after seeing the room). It was possible for us to upgrade, however we would be charged for both rooms that first night as housekeeping had already left for the evening and even though we only stepped foot in the room, they would not have been able to rent the room that evening. Not the best customer service. The bathroom in our room was tiny....not the best products, and you could just about hop out of bed and land in the bathroom, which was unexpected after viewing the pictures of the hotel. This is a small hotel, definitely comfortable but has some quirks which are easy to live with considering the room rate and its ideal location. Be prepared to leave your key with the desk and yes, I was able to get a pot of hot water for tea each evening, delivered to our room.
