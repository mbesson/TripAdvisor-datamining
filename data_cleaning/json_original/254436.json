Our go to place to stay in OC is the Hilton, but they were not only prohibitively expensive still at this time of year, they were booked. I am normally an ocean front balcony only gal, but decided to give this a try since the price and availability were right, and cleanliness is an absolute MUST. I booked us a deluxe efficiency, non smoking room and asked for the popular room 410. Since it was less than 24 hrs until our arrival, I was pleased to be able to get a booking, and pleasantly surprised to receive a call less than ten minutes later from the front desk there asking if room 408 would suffice instead, as room 410 was occupied. Upon our arrival, check in was fast and efficient. We used a handy luggage cart, navigated the much maligned elevators, which while old and a bit lurchy upon docking at the designated floor, were certainly not as bad as reported, and arrived at our room. The room was an adequate size, with two double beds, a pullout couch, a table and chairs for four. A galley kitchenette, and a fair sized bathroom rounded out the room. Everything was CLEAN, fresh and inviting. The view from our balcony was an unobstructed side view of ocean, very nice. It does get the sun all afternoon though which may limit its use for some. The kitchenette was stocked with basics: dishes, glasses, mugs, pans, flatware, basic cooking utensils, dish towel and cloth, dish soap.. Plan your coking needs ahead, pack thoughtfully, always remember a sharp knife (even at the Hilton!), condiments, oil, food wrap, salt and pepper etc. Water was hot enough to do good job on dirty dishes. Bathroom had toiletries, plenty of white clean motel grade towels in good condition, counter space, hair dryer with night light and huge mirror. Water pressure in shower was better than many places, adequate. Kleenex and toilet paper is standard sandpaper motel grade. Beds are firm and smooth, linens white and fresh. We always push double beds together if there is no king bed, and since these were on wheels, that's what we did. The pillows were bouncy, not flat and tired. We slept fine, albeit feet hanging off the end because double beds just aren't long enough for most modern era adults. There is a handy, easy to use roomy safe in the room which we used for iPad, Xbox etc . The pool was clean, a pleasant size, heated to a dreamy temperature, open until 9pm. Perfect. We will absolutely stay here again, particularly after the season in September, when rates are low and the ocean is such a pleasant temperature after the long hot summer. My only complaint is the sodium light on the balcony that came on at dusk and was not able to be turned off. Even with curtains closed, the light was intrusive. We shut the room divider halfway at night to block it off.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harpers Ferry, West Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for a Weekend\u201d", "Author": "JMCH513", "ReviewID": "UR139931573", "Content": "My family stayed at the Spinnaker over the weekend (Sept. 7 - 9) and had a wonderful stay!

The hotel is not directly on the boardwalk -- there is another hotel between the Spinnaker and the beach -- but all that means is that you still have all the convenience of the boardwalk with none of the noise. We took advantage of their late checkout policy so we could leave at our leisure rather than rush to be out of the room at 11:00am -- the hotel was perfectly accommodating to our wishes. They were also very helpful in recommending places to eat within walking distance of the hotel. The hotel room was complete with a small kitchenette, so bringing food to cook is certainly an option. The only slight negative was indeed the bed size. My husband is over six feet and the beds did not really accommodate his size.

Spinnaker puts you right on top of the boardwalk and you are within a short drive from the major attractions in all of OC. The cool part is when you step out on the balcony and look to the left all you can see is the calmness and relaxation of the beach. When you see the palm trees and the sunset you know you have made it to your getaway place. We both liked that they gave you hard and soft pillows for the beds so you could pick which was best for you. The beds were also comfortable, and while some may think that they're small, were actually big enough for us. The pool (on level 1) was clean and warm, and it was a good thing to have because there were rip currents on the ocean which made the ocean too dangerous to swim. We had breakfast at Malia's Cafe on Thursday morning, but while the food was good, we decided Layton's on 16th was our go to for the remainder of the trip. Our housekeeper, Monica, also did a great job cleaning the room every day. Overall, though, we were extremely satisfied staying here and would come back on our next trip down!

Each bed had 4 pillows which you hardly see. Maid service was good. Our maid was Monica who did an okay job cleaning the room. I find she did a better job once she knew us but hey that's just me. The hotel staff at front desk were great. Gave us good directions to local spots. Staff did a great job clesning the hotel grounds and pool. The only complaint I would have is no ice machines so you have to buy some but it is great to have a kitchen so the families with us with children could cook. We all went to the Walmart and stocked our room with all sorts of goodies. This way you can save with breakfast and eat 2 or even 1 meal out. The cafe on site served very good breakfast even though service was slow. We had a ball and I will stay at the this hotel again. We enjoyed the large balconies which had 2 chairs and a table. We sat out at night talking and people watched. This hotel is steps from the beach and boardwalk. The pool has a really large sitting area with tables and umbrellas.

We decided to take our granddaughters on a mini vacation for three days and selected this motel based on the reviews. I did see two negative reviews but didn\u2019t give them much merit because the majority was very positive. We stayed on the 5th floor and had a wonderful view of both the ocean and the bay. The balcony is very large and can hold quite a few people comfortably. If someone were smoking on the adjacent balconies I don\u2019t think you would be able to smell it because there are dividers on both sides. We asked for a non-smoking room but none were available however we did not smell any kind of odors and they had even offered to put in a smoke removal machine prior to our arrival but we declined since we knew it had a balcony and we could get fresh air if needed. The room was spacious (I included a few pictures) and well decorated. It was VERY clean so I really don\u2019t understand the two reviews that went on about how dirty this place was. There was no smell of mildew, mold or any other offending odors. The AC cooled the room very well. The beds were very comfortable; the sheets were incredible soft and four very fluffy pillows per bed. There was a divider you could pull (picture included) so if anyone were sleeping in the sofa area there was privacy for both areas. There was a nice table and chairs, a flat screen TV with plenty of cable channels. The wifi speed was average for any hotel/motel. The small kitchen was very clean as well as plenty of adequate dishes and pots. The bathroom was a little on the small side but clean with great water pressure and plenty of hot water. The pool area was very nice with a large deck and numerous tables and chairs. The boardwalk and beach was a short block away and we took the train to the pier one night which was fun. The beach area was nice and not too crowded. A couple negative items: I have to say is the parking was a pain if you had to park after 8:00 PM there was nothing available. We did go ask the front desk and she was kind enough to come outside and find us a makeshift parking space behind the caf\u00e9 but we were a bit nervous leaving our Infiniti there because we were afraid someone would back into it the way it was positioned. The 2nd negative would be the elevator door closed a bit quick and hard for my liking. I made sure my granddaughters were in first because I was afraid it could close on them. The 3rd would be the caf\u00e9. We had breakfast there the first morning and the service was extremely slow and there were not even that many customers there at the time. The food was just ok; but there are much better breakfast places in OC so I would not eat there again. I can\u2019t comment on housekeeping because I don\u2019t let them in my rooms at any hotel however I did see them scrubbing the floors in the rooms (so they do clean) and they were very pleasant and always made a point of greeting you. If I ever need a motel again I would definitely stay here for the money.

We were able to walk or take the tram to the southern part of the boardwalk (busier area with rides, etc) but it was nice to be staying in a quieter/less congested area. Our room was near spotless so I am confused by some of the negative reviews. Per usual, we didn't have housekeeping come to clean our room during our stay (we like our privacy). However, the staff were very friendly as we passed them in the hallways and asked us if there was anything we needed. The front desk staff was also very helpful with recommendations and information to answer all of my various questions upon check-in :-) They were even accomodating when we asked to extend our stay. Unfortunately, we would have had to switch rooms and ended up deciding to stick with our original plan and return home. We arrived well before check-in and stayed for the afternoon on the day of check-out and were able to park in the motel lot and utilize the changing rooms so that we could get in as much beach time as possible.

(We knew we were stuck with the room because of NO refunds so we tried to make the best of the situation.) We requested new towels because the ones in the room were damp and smelled of mildew. I needed to strip the beds as hair and sand were EVERYWHERE. The floors were stained and after a quick scrub of the kitchen floor I found pills that had been dropped and not swept up. Needless to say we didn't use ANYTHING in the kitchen unit. With two children in the room, it was alarming that we found remnants of liquor caps, strange stains/food/etc. wiped on the walls and sticky refrigerator handles. We had to make a trip to the nearest CVS for cleaning supplies where I proceeded to clorox the bathroom/tub and wipe down the entire room. I wouldn't even let my children sit on the couch because it was so stained. We didn't place anything in the drawers because the whole room was filthy. The beds were listed as \"queen\" but they were certainly full-sized (and we didn't even attempt the sofa bed as it was filthy.) Our feet hung out over the bed so be prepared if you are tall OR you were expecting a queen-sized bed. While wiping down the dining table, I moved it a bit and the leg about fell off...it was surreal. The air conditioning unit in the room had black mold coming out and around the filter/unit. I bleached and wiped as much of the mess as I could. All in all we attempted to stay out of the room as much as possible (thank goodness the motel is so close to the beach and boardwalk). I'm a little shocked that this motel received such great reviews. Again, we are pretty reasonable people but it was a little much to have such a dirty room. We didn't even request room service because we just cleaned everything ourselves. I will say that the staff was accommodating to bring new linens and towels and I am not sure they had much control over the situation. I don't know if the motel staff were rushed, didn't have the right cleaning supplies, they may not have enough help or what but the rooms could definitely use some major work. The \"renovations\" are extremely cheaply done. This room may have worked for a college crew that didn't really care about cleanliness but for a family of four (with young kids) it was a nightmare. Lesson learned...we are already making our reservations for next year's trip because we don't want to be stuck with motel options like this one. :o(", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rockville, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cA great little place and great location\u201d", "Author": "Steph7168", "ReviewID": "UR136762342", "Content": "We stayed for 4 nights recently.

You also have that option when booking on the web to choose and receive free vouchers-how many is depending on the number of nights that you stay(we could choose 4). This may sound too good to be true but it is for real. Some vouchers allow for $15.00 or more off on a meal. I chose one for BJ's on the Water for $15.00 off which was absolutely free.There are vouchers offered for food as well as other services and attraction. Some are free of charge while others are offered at a reduced rate. I received a call at the end of April from Anita as I had not specified whether I wanted a smoking or non smoking room. Anita was so kind,helpful,and accomodating. I indicated on my web reservation that I would like to be in a room as close to the ocean as possible. I was aware that the motel was not ocean front as there is another building in front of it. Anita advised me that she put us in a room as close to the ocean as possible and that she thought that we would be very pleased. This was a very special trip for us as I indicated on the reservation that my husband was diagnosed with and had successful surgery and chemo for Pancreatic Cancer last June and was now cancer free. I felt like I was talking to an old friend when I spoke to Anita on the phone. We arrived at the motel on the 29th and were promptly checked in by a very helpful young lady named Sade' even though it was not even check in time yet. We were given room 510 which is on the south side of the building with rooms recently redecorated with new carpet,flat screen tv's etc. What can I say-Room 510 was awesome-it was on the top floor with a private balcony as close and as fantastic of a view of the ocean without it being ocean front. The view was fantastic and unobstructed.The balcony was private with a partition dividing it from the next balcony. We previously stayed in the Holiday Inn and Suites next door with a southern view using Priority Club points but the view was not near as clear or as awesome as the Spinnaker.I am very picky and found the entire room including the bathroom to be super clean and nicely furnished including new carpet and a flat screen tv. There was also a nicely furnished kitchen.We were told that they are also in the process of refurbishing the north building also. They have a nice outdoor heated pool. Our reservation included breakfast for 2 (2 vouchers equaling $16.00) at their on site cafe(open for breakfast and luch only). You were only able to order from a limited menu but it was still a great value for the price. The only suggestion I would make is to be able to use up to $16.00 if you would like to order from their regular menu but I have no complaints otherwise. Our room was very quiet. We did have a slight problem with the card key as it was a little quirky. I did get to meet Anita at checkout and she was just as pleasant in person as on the phone. Thanks Anita for putting us in an awesome room which made it extra special and to Sade' for your great service checking us in and out. We will definately be back.

This is not a bad hotel. It is clean but there is a hotel in front of it and the balconies are angled sideways so you have to really stick your body over the balcony to see the ocean. The smoking rooms get a little closer to the ocean. I dont understand why hotels like the Stowaway Grand arent ranked higher on here. They have good ratings, they are ocean front, on the boardwalk and affordable. That was my view from the Spinnaker so I couldnt understand why that one wasnt ranked before Spinnaker. I also inquired about the price which was equivalent to what I paid at Spinnaker. There are a dozen or more hotels that FACE the ocean and have the same affordable prices. These rankings are deceiving. Again, not bad for a moderate hotel but I need to see the ocean when I'm at the ocean! If I'm going to pay decent money, I want a great view of the ocean and there are better choices out there.

There's a Dunkin Donuts right across the street, and also a restaurant in the same building which we didn't try. The main boardwalk is about a 15-20 minute walk, but you can always take the Boardwalk Tram ($20 for a roundtrip for a family of 4, not bad). We drove to the Assateague Island which is not too far from the motel. Food: There are good restaurants all around We did dinner at Da Vinci by the Sea, near 15th street. The food was good, and their house wine (I tried the Cabernet) was even better. I got breakfast from Dunkin Donuts right across the street. Amenities: They have clean rooms and a heated pool Though we didn't try the pool we did see a lot of people make good use of it. The rooms are spacious and clean. Our efficiency came with two double beds and an extra sleeper sofa. There was also a small kitchenette with all essentials like plates, spoons, forks, bowls, etc. The bathroom was little tight, but had really hot water running all the time. They don't provide shampoo so remember to carry your own. The main reason I'm giving this 4-stars is because it doesn't have a coin operated laundry. The closest one is on 7th or 8th street. This motel is on 18th street. Parking is convenient, right next to the motel and is free, limited to one car per room, and you get a tag when you check in. There is a balcony, ours overlooked the side street and also gave us a view of the beach. The balcony has two vinyl chairs that are useful for sitting or even hanging clothes to dry. :-) There is a 27\" flat screen Samsung TV that the kids enjoyed. There's a breakfast table and 4 chairs that was handy when I got breakfast from Dunkin Donuts. There's a safe in the room that we didn't use.

Front-desk staff was friendly, but I cannot say the same for the maids. I witnessed one the maids making a slight remark when she was told to clean the rooms. She said, something snotty on the lines of she'll clean them when she gets to them, check-in isn't until 4pm anyway.

Located just a half block away from the beach and boardwalk on 18th street, it is close enough to the action but far away from the busiest/noisiest sections of the boardwalk. It is the perfect location. I wouldn't want to stay any further north. The shops/food pretty much start on 16/17th street. The rooms are great. They are large w/2 double beds and a pullout couch. We didn't have a need to pull the couch out so I can't comment on that but to sit on it was very uncomfortable. That didn't bother us though. as we just used it to throw clothes. We pushed the beds together and it became a King and a half. The room had a 27 inch flat screen tv w/all the cable channels you'd want plus HBO. The best feature is the kitchenette. It has a full size fridge, stove, coffee maker, microwave and sink. The fridge was great because we had a lot of leftover food that we could store and also refreeze our cooler icepacks. We ate dinner out 2 nights and had leftovers for 2 nights. it was terffific. We were in a corner room in the South Bldg. If you stay try to get the corner room in the South Bldg. The room #'s are 510, 410 and even 310 should be fine. We were in 410 and because we were the corner, had no balcony to the left of us, just a picture perfect view of the beach and ocean. The North Bldg is on the Bay side, so the views won't be as good. If you can't get a corner room in the South Bldg just try to get 1 next to it if possible. The closer to the corner, the better the views. They have a pool and deck which looked fine but we didn't use because we were there for the beach. They also have a cafe downstairs, Malia's. We ate there for breakfast once and it was good. My only complaint with the motel are the elevators.

We had a couple of things that needed mechanical attention after we checked into our room, but that was promptly taken care of.

I booked the motel about two months in advance for two nights, Thursday and Friday. I liked the location on the boardwalk, about in the middle of it in a quieter part of the boards. Closer to the time of our stay, they started a promotion where if you booked 2 nights, you'd get a third night free but does not include weekends. I called the hotel to ask about it, just in case I might be able to take take advantage of the promo. They immediately and graciously gave me Wednesday for free. In addition to that, they also gave me 4 discount vouchers from various restaurants and one for a t shirt from a local pub. I got to choose which ones I wanted, and used 2 of them during my stay. A total savings of $35 by using the two vouchers. When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by the nicest desk attendant. She was pleasant and upbeat and couldn't do enough for us. The Spinnaker sets back behind one building, but only steps to the boardwalk and beach, so I asked for the highest floor and best view available. Unfortunately, that room was being renovated, so they gave me the one next to it. We were delighted the moment we opened our door. Everything was fresh and clean, new carpeting and bedding and mattresses. Flat screen tv's, a full kitchen, and four comfy pillows on each bed. The view was very good and we could see both the ocean and the bay from our balcony. The ony negative I have to say was that the sofa bed in the room needed replacing..........not because it was dirty, but because it was worn. And there was no shampoo, but in this economy it's a small thing to sacrifice considering the great rate and deals we received in return. Oh, and they also have a very nice cafe on site and we also received a free breakfast for 2 at the cafe! Very bright and cheerful with a Carribbean decor. The food was very good........hot and tasty, and excellent service.

The beds, bed linens, and furniture are well taken care of and very comfortable.

The efficiency kitchen was perfect for stocking food and beverages so that we didn't have to go to restaurants for some of our smaller meals. An even bigger plus for me was the cleanliness of the property -- the bedroom, the kitchen, and the bathroom were immaculate. But the top billing goes to the location of the place: right on the boardwalk, being walkable distance to just about anything. I also couldn't get over how friendly everyone was. The staff (in particular the front desk and housekeeping staff) made you feel like they knew you, even though they'd never met you in their lives. They know how to make someone feel like a genuine \"guest\". If I had anything negative to say, it would be a minimal comment about the poor water pressure on the 5th floor.

The pull out bed was alright, better for kids. We let gram and pop have the one bed and my son to have the other. My wife and I had the pullout. We requested to have another mattress to double it up. They brought a brand new one!. - rooms need to be updated. Some of the carpet was not even right to the wall( like a 1 inch gap from wall) in certain areas. Some wallpaper separated from wall. -bathroom was alright. Clean and medium sized. Toilet was a little wobbly and exhaust fan underpowered. Water pressure was weak. - speaking of restrooms. They have a restroom right by the pool. Good luck on using it. The office told me they lock it after 3 because there is a leak! It maybe locked before that too!.

But before we could even take our shower, we had to walk to CVS to buy shampoo, which the hotel does not provide. When making your reservation, you should specify whether or not you want a smoking room. They didn't mention that they had both rooms, so they put us in a smoking room even though we wanted a non-smoking room. However, they did a good job sanitizing the room to the point where the smoke smell wasn't present. We were on the fourth floor, which had a good side view of the ocean, but be prepared to take the steps because the elevator, the one and only in the building, was ridiculously slow. The weekday price was suitable for the room, but their price for the weekends and holidays are higher than other hotels that offer better amenities. Finally, if you are hoping to bring the laptop along and connect to their wifi, forget it. Our connection would last a minute before disconnecting and requiring us to re-boot our computer.

My daughter and I celebrated our birthdays with a week long vacation . This was an important vaction for us, the first we are taking together as Adults ( she just turned 20) , the first after a major loss in our family, and of course to celebrate our birthdays which are 5 days apart. The Spinnaker Hotel was a wonderful choice to make for our lodging needs. I have been in Senior Management in the Hotel Industry for the past 20 plus years working 4 star full service to Economy Brands, I have worked in both the Sales and Operations end of the business. My daughter has grown up in the industry via mom and can voice her displeasure quite well. I set the Bar High and so does she. So taking a chance on a hotel I had no idea about was going to be a true trust in the Management and Team of Associates I was about to meet. The Spinnaker Hotel on 18th and Baltimore exceeded my expectations in a Summer Resort Beach Hotel. Five Perfect reasons why: 1. Reservations made easy by using the OCMOTELS website, Somehow I overbooked and my call to the hotel when I recieved confirmation to cxl one reservation was met by Anita the Asst.Manager , I could hear her smile through the phone, made the changes I needed, took time to ask me what I needed while I woulod be with them, and my room when I arrived was EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED ! Thank you Anita. 2. Our arrival was expected, by the hotel, and the TEAM at the front desk, meeting Anita and Judy was a perfect start, the location was easy to get to and right at the beach and boardwalk. They told us about all we should see, the best places to eat , they took an interest in us, why we were visiting, who we were. WE BECAME PART OF THE FAMILY ! 3. Lugging all we had to the room ( remember 2 women) was made easy, they asked us if we needed help WOW ! Luggage carts , an elevator to 5th floor ,like a cool beach breeze! THe room was clean and well kept, it had all the requirements we needed and more ( well a 2nd bath would be nice) and enough space for all of our things and all we bought during the week. I could see a family of 4 being quite comfortable. OUr veiw from room --- (I am not telling or I will never get in it again :) was fantastic , perfect, wonderful. The beds were very comfortable, I slept like a log ( ask my daughter how well I snored). WE FELT AT HOME ! 4. I met the General Manager Heather and one of the Corporate Directors and and they asked me how my stay was, what were my suggestions to help them improve, they thanked me for choosing the SPINNAKER MOTEL, and again made suggestions on Ocean City activities. WE FELT WELCOMED! 5. We were enjoying ourselves so much we extended our stay, due to making this change on July 3rd they asked if we would mind switching rooms as the perfect view room was already booked, they would move us , I was just as pleased with room 2, a larger balcony and still a fantastic view of the Ocean , Beach and Boardwalk. The consistancy of the conditon and cleanliness was the same , no dissapointments with that. The pool was clean and refreshing , the sundeck inviting and colorful with flags, plants and GREAT LOUNGE AND PICINIC FURNITURE, the onsite resturant was like visiting a family member , the staff was welcoming the food good and the price right. The location was perfect, the housekeeping and maint teams were helpful and always smiling, our stay was GREAT. WE GOT VALUE!

Hands down, regardless of any complaints the location is great and the rooms have all the ammenities you could possibly need and are very clean. Our room, which I would assume to be \"standard\" had a kitchenette including dishes, an almost full size fridge/freezer, microwave, toaster and coffee maker. The bedroom had two full size beds plus a pull out sofa-sleeper with and actual room divider in between. I loved the balcony the best! We traveled with kids so this was so relaxing in the evening. We were able to go out and have some PRIVACY from our kids!!! I realize the balconies aren't fully private as one other review had stated but they were more than private enough for us. They have partitions which start about 6 - 12\" off the ground and go about 6 - 12\" from the ceiling and all the way to the railing. I guess I wouldn't put anything out there that you'd be worried about getting stolen but with the hum of the a/c and the partitions it was awesome! Private conversation! I wished we had one at every stop on our travels! Others have also commented about the view being partial but I know from where we were we had a very nice view. I guess when you book this hotel you have to keep in mind it's not ocean front but for the value who cares! If you want to see the ocean up close walk down to the beach, it's literally 1/2 a block down! There were a few small things that happened while we were staying there... at one point I went in to take a shower and water was pouring in from upstairs onto my head. I found out in a quick hurry that our upstairs neighbor had overflowed his toilet. The hotel staff handled it very well. Fixed the problem and came and cleaned our bathroom with an apology. Although I could've done without the toilet water on my head they were very apologetic and really it wasn't their fault so I don't feel like they owed me anything but the apology was very nice and appreciated. My only other real complaint was that our last night their my now husband and I decided to get married. My cousin was kind enough to take our girls so we could have one night to ourselves. In the morning housekeeping was banging on our door and calling our room. I'm sure we stayed out later than we probably needed to but the staff knew we were getting married so I thought it was a bit much. Especially when my husband and I were running back and forth trying to load our van with 2 - 3 housekeeping staff standing directly outside our door waiting for us to get out.

It hasn't been updated much since then, but that's OK. The bathroom had a mustard yellow bathtub, sink and toilet, just as it did then. The shower temperature is not consistent. WiFi access is intermittent and extremely slow when connected (that's a new addition since I last stayed there!). However, I would definitely stay there again. As returning guests they gave us room 518 on the top floor of the north building, with lovely views. The staff were very welcoming - from check-in to the cleaning staff that greeted us (and remembered my son's name!) daily. The location is fantastic - it's 1/2 block away from the boardwalk; far enough away and quiet from the downtown attractions, but close enough to walk there without needing the $3 per person per trip tram. We loved renting bikes at 16th street in the mornings for our boardwalk jaunts. The Spinnaker is like visiting your favourite old dotty aunt; her house may not have been updated in awhile, but the welcome is warm and you wouldn't imagine staying anywhere else. Incidentally, there are new hotels on the beach since my last visit to Ocean City and new investment (prior to credit crunch?). I looked up the Holiday Inn next door for next year, and they wanted $499/night.

All I can say is that I was extremely pleased with the views and the sounds of crashing waves. The sunsets and sunrises were incredible and the room was very satisfactory for me. The maid service was excellent and I was always greeted with smile. (I even gave her the day off one day I was so pleased) :-P The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and I always felt very safe.

I don't know where to begin. We drove in to OC without reservations. After stopping at a few hotels with no success, we noticed the flashing neon vacancy sign. Now I see why! Check in was easy, but after that the trouble begins. First off, the office clerk didn't give us directions to the room, so we ended up in the wrong building. Turned out our building was across the parking lot. A parking space was easily found. As of now I wasn't to discouraged. THEN......we walked in the room. OH MY GOSH!!!!!! I couldn't believe it! I wanted to leave immediately, but when we signed in the check-in sheet states \"NO Refunds\". I seriously considered sleeping in my car. Anyway, as I checked the room over. The beds were first. DIRTY sheets! We immediately call the front desk for new sheets. As we're waiting for housekeeping, we noticed the dirty bathroom. It was apparent it was not cleaned. Soap pieces left in the tub from occupants before us, grime on the shower walls and the floor of the tub......needless to say, we showered in our flip flops. The refridgerator had spills in it and hairs on the door handle. The phone was dirty (dirtier than a typical hotel phone). The couch was so stained I wouldn't let my kids sit on it. The bedspreads (that I don't think hotels ever wash anyway) had stains all over them. And then there was the smell of mildew in the air. Okay, by this point housekeeping has arrived. She came in, looked at the sheets and proceeded to strip the beds. Throwing everything on the floor, including the pillows that we are supposed to be using for the night. Then she brings in some \"clean\" sheets. First of all, there is no fitted sheets. She went through at least 20 sets of sheets before she found ones acceptable to put on the bed. I am NOT exaggerating! My husband and I just looked at each other in astonishment. After the 1/2 hour of re-making our beds. We finally got out of there to see some attractions. I was dreading the thought of going back there for the evening, so I was trying to stay out as long as I could, but with 2 children it was a little difficult. Our last stop of the evening was to CVS so I could see if they had a sheet set for the beds. No luck there, but I did buy a tablecloth to lay across it so it wouldn't feel as gross. Back to the hotel we went and started getting our showers for the evening. I figured I'd better check the towels over since nothing else was clean and with no surprise, they felt damp and had plenty of hairs on them from previous occupants. YUCK!!!!!! Then to the shower (where I used the paper towels that I keep in my car for a wash cloth). And it was a good thing I didn't use all my clean beach towels. Wasn't expecting to have to use them for my shower. Then once you got in, the water would be hot and then cold as you showered. Nothing you could do at this point after you're all soaped up. After the lengthy measures of the shower taking, I finally was ready to use the hair dryer. I was 1/2 way through the drying and the power went out. I thought \"NO WAY\" , this has got to be a bad dream. So, my husband called down to the front desk and they asked if we were using more than two electronics at once (not knowing there was a limit), DUH on our part I guess. Only 1 piece of electronics at a time there! To make a long story short Which I did because there was a few other little things I left out, but I can't go on all night.

We were extremely lucky to get a room reserved only five or six days ahead of time, and the price was more than reasonable. The Spinnaker has many pros and cons to it, so I figured I'd write them all down since we read a ton of TripAdvisor reviews before we booked our vacation. Some PROS: 1. We reserved our room not even a week before our vacation and managed to get a great room -- top floor on the corner, where our balcony gave us views of the ocean, bay, and street. I really enjoyed hanging out on the balcony, although I wish they were fully private. The room also had a kitchen complete with an oven and refrigerator. Amenity-wise, we couldn't ask for much more (little bottles of shampoo and conditioner would have been nice since we forgot conditioner), especially considering the price. 2. The staff is extremely friendly. Housekeeping, the employees at the front desk, and maintenance were all warm and professional the entire time (except for a small mishap between me and the elevator, which I'll explain later). Housekeeping is especially great, the rooms are kept clean and our room was always cleaned before 1:00. 3. Great location. 18th Street is a great middle-ground between the often dirty, action-packed end of the boardwalk and the hotels up in the 50s and up. You're still on the boardwalk but it's not too crowded. Next door the Holiday Inn boasts two awesome outdoor pools as well as a rinse-off hose you can steal from time to time, and further down the Quality Inn (I think?) has a nice outdoor bar. Restaurants/buffets, CVS, Dunkin Donuts, liquor shops, and mini-golfing are all within easy walking distance to the Spinnaker. Some CONS: 1. The beds are absolutely terrible. I'm really not a picky person, and I was looking forward to claiming the pull-out sofa, but when I lay down on the mattress I could feel the metal springs pushing into me from below. Not being able to sleep on the pull-out sleeper definitely made our sleeping arrangements more complicated, and even so the beds were uncomfortable. The Spinnaker really should invest in new comfy mattresses -- if they did the rooms would have everything we asked for (except conditioner). Also they definitely aren't queen-size beds, more like doubles. 2. The elevators are scary, and yeah, I'm picky about elevators. I don't want to be riding in something that sounds like it's scraping against a concrete wall or moans or makes squeaky noises. All the guests tend to joke with each other in the elevators about how creepy they are, but I actually got stuck in one of them alone on the second day before we left for about 15, 20 minutes. I was stuck between the 4th and 5th floors, and the lights on all the buttons went off. I rang the alarm but got no response. Thank God I had my cell phone, because I called my brother and he ran out to the elevator and could hear me behind it. Both of us managed to crack open the doors about 1 cm wide, so at least he could talk me through the experience (AND so I could get some air -- the fan stayed on but it kept getting hotter and hotter), but all in all I am extremely claustrophobic and it ruined the day. Eventually somebody came, the elevator door was opened up and I had to climb up onto the 5th floor. The woman at the front desk ended up docking the bill for that day when my mom complained about the situation at check-out (nobody ever came to our room afterward, no apologies or anything until we complained), and the elevator I got stuck in was shut down for the rest of the time we were there -- and I only took the stairs -- but I still felt overlooked. It was just a crappy situation and I don't think they handled it the best they could. 3. The TV and free wifi both left something to be desired. We had a few power problems with the TV and had maintenance come twice to fix it, and we couldn't adjust the volume on HBO for some reason. Also for the wifi, I was initially given the wrong password, but after I got the password again the second day we only got between 1 and 2 bars of wireless reception from our 5th-floor room. I could check my email but not much more -- definitely couldn't go on AIM or be surfing the internet too long -- it was very slow, crappy reception. I tried to connect to another nearby wifi but they were also password-protected. 5th floor deserves good wireless reception just as much as the 1st floor! -- All in all the Spinnaker is worth the price. I would go back, but I'd probably take the stairs and bring a mattress pad. I loved the view from our corner balcony, I loved the women in housekeeping who were worrying alongside my family when I was trapped in the scary elevator. We all enjoyed the location.

On the plus side the room is a nice size and full fridge with small stove and microwave which was nice. A nice pool and sun deck. Yes I have read this is an older motel but it would be so much nicer if they would replace the old worn out dirty carpet, clean the rooms a little better and dont advertise internet access when there is no signal. For the money I will look elsewhere next time.", "Date": "July 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "ohio", "Title": "\u201cNever Again\u201d", "Author": "joeamy2007", "ReviewID": "UR17580786", "Content": "I wouldn't suggest this hotel to anyone but some college students that are at OC to party. The rooms are very outdated and dirty. The carpeting was disgusting and there were cigar wrappers under the bed (non smoking room) and a bottle of something under the bed from someone prior to us. The mattresses are wore out. -nothing but springs They don't have fitted sheets -it's a flat sheet that doesn't fit the bed and as you sleep it rides up the bed. GROSS------- We bought clorox spray from CVS and wiped everything down. We wiped up the floor in the bathroom and it was black. If you want ice you have to buy your own somewhere else. They don't have an ice machine. The lady at the front desk said that's why we have ice trays in the freezer. WOW- 1 ice tray. We needed to iron clothes and there wasn't an iron and ironing board in the room. We had to call the front desk and I had to go down to the front office and get it myself. The office is across the parking lot in another building. I was asked to bring it back when I was done because they were full and other people would need it. Let's not forget the showers. It's hot then cold-hot-cold. You are either freezing to death or burnt up. Another woman in the reviews commented about the people standing around and smoking. Very true. There is a room next to the elevators and they sit in there and smoke. That's where all of the sheets and towels are kept. So basically all of that cigarette smoke is on your towels and sheets. Not good for people with allergies. Internet access- Good luck. They have internet but you won't be on there long before you are kicked off repeatedly. My husband had homework to do for an on line course and he got kicked off so frequently he had to quit. Parking- it's very tight and if it's super busy you had better not do too many trips-or you will not have a parking spot when you come back. If you choose to stay here- GOOD LUCK. I wish I had read more reviews prior to staying. On the positive side-not beach front but close and the pool was pretty nice.", "Date": "July 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore", "Title": "\u201cStill great after all of these years~\u201d", "Author": "BeachPirate1976", "ReviewID": "UR17287797", "Content": "May 2008 marked my long return to OC.

They quoted us a price over the phone that was lower than any other website offered and then lowered it again by another 20 bucks per night. They were more than happy to get us the best deal they could, and we weren't even asking! I had stayed in Ocean City several times before and I always thought the Spinnaker was unique-looking with its orange and blue decor. When we got to the hotel, we were pleasantly surprised by how nice the rooms were. The bathroom was very nice and clean and the kitchenette was very convenient. I'm not sure if the hotel offered wireless internet or if we were taking it from a next door hotel, but nonetheless we did have internet access to look up restaurants and attractions in Ocean City. The best part was the location. Although the hotel can't say they are a boardwalk hotel, they are 1/2 block off the boardwalk, still with beautiful ocean views from the rooms. We really enjoyed sitting on our balcony in the evening, being able to see and hear the ocean. It was so nice to be able to walk out of our hotel and be just steps away from the beach and the ocean. The best was when we were done, we could walk right off the beach to the pool. The location of the hotel is also very convenient to all the shops and attractions on the boardwalk, being right in the middle. You don't have to drive anywhere really. One small complaint is that the pool did close pretty early, and I wish we could've gone for a night swim. Also, the hotel didn't have laundry which we could have used. The room was clean enough for me, but maybe a little sandy and damp, which I expected anyway from an oceanfrontish room. Also, wish they had king-size beds.

The rooms were very clean and smelled clean right from the get go. We stayed in the North building which is not the front desk buildingand it is so maintained and clean. The housekeeping staff is there early every am and our housekeeper on 2nd floor in the north building did a great excellent job. I was very pleased this year. It seems as though they have more cleaning staff this year than last. The pool and the large pool area is just the cleanest I have seen and I have did a lot of walking this year and checked out other properties on my travels. The Cafe is another great thing. The 2 waitresses are great and quick for such a busy place. The prices are great and the food tastes great. I like the balcony. The Spinnaker does have private balconies there are dividers up if you see other properties on along the ocean front they don't have that. There are balconies but most do not have dividers. I can not wait to book next years trip. The Spinnaker is also in a great location too. Right by the CVS and a liquor store and some great coffee at Dunkin Donuts. 3 blocks from Phillips all you can eat Seafood buffet too. The front desk staff is just wonderful and amazing here as well.

No streets to cross caryying your stuff to the beach. They said all rooms had oceanview balconies and they did. I appreciate they didn't lie and call it oceanfront. Also, if you look the other way you could see the bay. nice. Also, you can walk to everything. 18th St is relatively quiet, but just a couple blocks from where the restaurants and shops start. Rooms were extra large and included a kitchenette and dining area.
