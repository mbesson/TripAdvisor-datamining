I liked the location because it made getting around Rome alot easier.The only thing i did with my group/ friends was come back to the hotel to sleep and shower so it served its purpose well. i didnt like the breakfast simply because I wanted to have a legit cappuccino and cornetto almost every morning, and I could eat ham and cheese back in the states so i wasnt missing out on anything great.

We did a lot of walking, and found we were within easy (for us, we hike a lot) walking distance of the Coliseum, forum, and many other churches and piazzas.

A lot of the best sites are located within walking distance. It is located a block and a half from the Roma Termini station. The metro is also located in the same place. If you are coming from the Fiumicino Airport on the Termini Express be fore warned that this train stops before any to the other trains. Don\u2019t take the elevator or the steps down to the lower level that is located at the end of the track. Instead stay to your right and stay in the terminal. If you do go to the lower level and exit the building turn to your right. You will go up a hill for about three blocks and across two busy streets then turn left for half a block. If you come out of the Termini exit look for the McDonalds across the street. This will let you know you are at the correct exit. Upon exit from the Termini turn left walk to the far side of the first street to cross then turn right. The Hotel is located half way down the block. . The hotel is clean and quite as long as the windows are closed. If you leave the widows open the traffic runs all night with some on the truck traffic starting at three in the morning. The rooms are small but almost all the rooms in this price range are about the same. The worst thing I found was the size of the shower. Don\u2019t drop the soap because you can\u2019t bend over to pick it up. Our room had a King size bed and there was still enough room to get around. They do have wi-fi but it is a extra 6 euros a day. If you don\u2019t like a hard bed this is not the hotel for you because the bed is like sleeping on the floor. The front desk is a mixture of people. On the day shift Alessandro is buy far head and shoulders above every one else. He speaks perfect English and will help with any problems you have. He always answered any of our questions where something was located, how far it was from the hotel and advice on where to eat. The Hotel doesn\u2019t have a Restaurant but it does have a breakfast that is well worth the extra cost. (see photos) There is a Restaurant close to the hotel with free wi-fi and good food. Turn left when you leave the hotel and it is on the corner of the block same side of street. If you want to site see close to the hotel turn left when you leave the hotel go three blocks south to Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. There is a grocery store (hard to find) across the street from the Basilica (east side) in the basement. It is not marked on the outside of the building but it has a lot if items. If you turn to the right (north) when you leave the hotel go the end of the block and turn left (west), walk five blocks to the Fountain of the Naiads.

It was rather clean, had good-working air conditioning but for a 4 star hotel it was pretty basic. We stayed in 3 star hotels that were at least as good as this one. We hated its beds. We did not rest well there because of the beds, which should be an essential good quality feature when one travels. My daughter and I had a twin room: the beds were the narrowest we ever slept in. Single beds for children I would call them. A more corpulent person could not possibly sleep in a bed that narrow - s/he would not fit, definitely. We are slender people and do not take much room at all, and still was hard for us to fit in them. The mattresses were so hard, it felt like they were made of wood or concrete - we woke up each morning with pins in our muscles and pain in our bones. Now we have at home very firm beds - because a firm mattress is much healthier than a very soft one, but there's a big difference between \"firm\" or \"sturdy\" and \"hard\" as rock. Also, the mattresses had no buttons on their surface as most of them have, but plastic bits in the shape and the size of a match-stick to hold the woolen content and the springs in place. Those sticks were protruding through the sheets because there was no proper mattress protector and every night we got scratches on our legs from them - it was like sleeping on a bench in a park lined with a bunch of horizontal nails or twigs... The other thing we did not agree with were the towels in the bathroom and the space in the shower which was the tiniest we ever had. A shower for very skinny people, when we showered we hit our elbows in the walls all the time. The large shower towels were OK, normal, soft, clean, white and fluffy etc. But all the smaller ones were ..TEA TOWELS!! Thin as calico or linen - it was hard to dry one's face without wetting entirely the whole towel...To dry one's hands repeatedly in a thin towel like that was impossible - it was soaking wet from the first attempt. Only in Italian hotels I saw that type of towels and I am wondering how could they benefit themselves or the customer offering that? I do not think the washing of the towels is cheaper that way - unless they are charged by the kilo..? Other than that, the rest of the services were OK, very good sound -proofed windows on such busty streets, good curtains to pull over to get the room dark if you need to sleep in, good sized room with lots of storage space. Unfortunately for a 4 star hotel, the safe was not even connected to electricity and could not be used, was there just to comply with the inventory. The breakfast included was quite all right, the beds were made daily, the room was not dusted daily though, but we could live with that. Perhaps the supervisor of the breakfast room would have looked much better in our eyes if he was less arrogant and did not want to show his importance so much, to the point that the boys under his control looked always frightened by him and he constantly raised his voice at them like they were naughty kids and he was the head-master showing off. All together, this is a pretty good hotel, 2 minutes away from Roma Termini Station and and within roughly 1 km walk from most attractions . Handy to public transport, close to the trains serving the airports. There are a couple of convenience stores near-by and lots of little restaurants, and the taxi-rank is 2 minutes away. But be warned, the area is really dirty, as most areas are around train stations and that is not something unusual for Rome in general. The hotel is not cheap, therefore the charge of 3 euros/day/person for city-fees was a surprise for us when we left, especially as we were not warned about it by Agoda, through which we booked our stay there. In all the other 13 countries we visited the city-fees were included in the overall price.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cClose to Termini Station\u201d", "Author": "8achan", "ReviewID": "UR116123332", "Content": "We stayed here for a couple of nights.

There was also a restaurant on the corner of the street, a 10second walk from the hotel. We had a meal there one night and it was lovely.

We arrived in Rome by train and departed 3 days later by air. Platform #24 for the direct airport train is about 100 ft. from the door of the Gioberti. Excellent if one has to get to the airport early for an 845am departure. From the Gioberti, we walked to the Palatino, the Colosseum, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain and more. The Termini is a bus hub; from there you can get buses to the Vatican, Borghese Gallery, and anywhere else you want to go. It's also a Metro station, so you can take the Metro and get robbed as I did. But it is a \"train\" hotel, so the environs are a little seedy. You have to keep your wits about you - this is Rome, after all. There are many nice little restaurants within a few blocks. And lots of shops, internet cafes, and the like. The breakfast room is on the first floor (i.e. one above ground level). No views, bland decor, ho hum. You might get an espress or cappucino from the adjoining coffee bar, if you ask nicely. My wife says to mention the foot spa in the bathroom. After a long day roaming the Palatino, Colosseum, Vatican Museums, Sistine Chapel and other sites, she was delighted to come back to the room and soak her tired feet in the spa. Wow, a foot spa in a 3-star hotel!? You mean the bidet? Well, the etymology of \"bidet\" is from an Old French word \"bider\", which means \"to trot\".

The situation of the hotel is handy for the metro (2 stops, 2 minutes from the Coloseum) and the bus station. Some nice bars and restaurants nearby and close to the Tourist Office for the shuttle bus and other tours.", "Date": "June 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunrise, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNice location - Hotel OK\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5326903", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Gioberti, Rome in May 2006. It is located just steps from the Termini Station (trains, buses and metro). The rooms are small but clean, I can say the same regarding the bathroom, small but clean. Breakfast was included and we found that the buffet is very good, breads/pastries, ham, prociutto, salami and cheese, fruit salad, coffee, juice, cereals and yogurt. The recepcionists are nice and helpful. For the price it is OK. After coming back and seeing so many nice areas in Rome, I just tkink that I woul've preferred to be somewhere else in the city with more attractive streets.... being near the terminal has it pros and cons - the pros; near the ground transportation \"hub\", the cons: a lot of informal vendors in the streets selling purses, glasses, belts, t-shirts, etc.and naturally.... hundreds of people rushing by the streets pulling luggage.", "Date": "June 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland", "Title": "\u201cfriendly\u201d", "Author": "Andy97239", "ReviewID": "UR5316948", "Content": "Just got back from our trip to Europe and while in Rome we stayed at Hotel Gioberti. Conveniently located next to Tremini Station and within walking distance from several attractions, this hotel would probably be a 3 stars hotel in my book. Our room was smaller than expected just based on all the pictures they have listed online. The tinny shower would be a hard challenge for anyone unless you have been practicing Yoga for several years. Over all was clean, with friendly personnel \u2013 they actually allowed us to check in couple of hours earlier than normal, having travel for 13 hrs. that was very nice. They have a terrific breakfast, unusually complex for Italy and Europe in general. The surrounding area is a little shady especially at night but probably no more than any areas close to the railway station in a big city. Overall a good choice if you are looking for convenience.", "Date": "June 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "belfast, ireland", "Title": "\u201cgreat location, clean, friendly good breakfast i recommend\u201d", "Author": "mcilduff", "ReviewID": "UR4628219", "Content": "we had a great time here the hotel is around the corner from the main train station and from were the bus from ciampino airport drops you of so no need for a taxi, it is within walking distance from most of the attractions including the collessium,trevi fountain,spanish steps,shops, bars you cant go wrong staying here, friendly staff with a sense of humour as we are 4 ladys with sense of humours and we like a good laugh although saying this the hotel is very quite. you can catch the open air tour bus just down the street and it is 12 euro you can hop on and of so is handy for visiting the Vatican although if going to the cistine chapel go very early about 8am as very long ques to get in. so all in all adding everything up i would definitely stay in this hotel again and i plan to do just that.", "Date": "March 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NI", "Title": "\u201cA decent enough hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4108875", "Content": "Stayed for 4 nights in Oct. Rome what can i say the weather was beautiful and what sights to behold. The hotel was fine, the room was clean, a good size but in general I would have to say that overall the hotel is deifinitly not UK standard 4* more like 3* but hey you get what you pay for and this hotel is VFM. The bed was comfortable, room safe was free, no street noise in the room we had at the back of the hotel and maid service every day. Breakfast the usual cold buffet type affair but never to badly queued, copious quantities of whatever took your fancy. Hotel bar wasn't open at night until i mentioned it at reception and asked them for a comment card. Previous reviews concerned me but we found the staff FRIENDLY absolutly no problems, happy to talk in english and give advice. The area is muti cultural and prime city centre.
