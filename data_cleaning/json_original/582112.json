BABBI \"The Manager\" and her incompetent so called staff need lessons on hospitality and customer service! My boyfriend called the Haven and gave the month and dates of when we would be coming. He was referred to their website by front desk employee, Martin. He told my boyfriend that there were 4 rooms available and that online offered a discount. So my boyfriend tried booking online. Online said there were no availabilities for our dates. My boyfriend then called the Haven a SECOND time and Martin told him that the website probably has not updated yet and to keep checking throughout the day. I then called the Haven and spoke to Martin and I told him when we wanted to book (3rd time Martin was given our dates in 1 day) and if he could honor the online discount. He said he couldnt honor it. I asked how often the website is updated. Martin told me it is updated daily, usually early morning. So why would he tell my boyfriend to waste his time and check throughout the day? I told my boyfriend this and he decided to wait until the next day to check and see if it had updated. The next day, the site had not updated. My boyfriend called Haven for the 4th time and spoke to Martin again. He told Martin the site still said no rooms available and questioned Martin as to why he could not honor the online pricing. Martin then said he could honor the online price and we booked the weekend we had talked to Martin about over the course of 2 days and 4 phone calls. My boyfriend paid for 1 of the 2 nights upfront over the phone. When we arrived at the Haven on the days we booked, we spoke to Babbi and another front desk employee. They could not find our reservation. It turned out Martin booked us for a completely different month and completely different dates. Instead of being apologetic, the front desk employee said it wasn't his mistake and that he would never make a mistake like this. Babbi did not even apologize to us. We wanted a specific room and view and they put us in the opposite of what we wanted. They said the room they were putting us in was bigger but bigger isn't better when your view is of a brick building. We asked what would happen the following night since we booked 2 nights. Babbi said she would call other hotels and find us a room because they were totally booked. We stressed out all night and into the next day over where we were moving to. The next day we didn't get a phone call so we had to go to the front desk and get an update. Babbi said she hadn't found us a room yet. It seemed like she had yet to even look. She began making phone calls and then asked us again for our contact info to call us when she found something. This impacted our vacation because we couldnt go do what we wanted. We had to stay close to the hotel since we would have to come back and \u00a0switch hotels and were being told we needed to be out by 1:15. We finally got a call from Babbi saying she found 2 places. We had never heard of either. They were both in the higher number streets and we specifically wanted a hotel on the boardwalk with an ocean view. We asked her questions about the 2 different hotels and which best fit what we were looking for. She told us we would hate the Atlantic Oceanfront Inn and to go with the Thunderbird Beach Motel. She said the thunderbird was right along the end of the boardwalk so we could still go on it conveniently. She said she use to work at the Atlantic and its \"really bad\" and that we would \"love\" the Thunderbird \"a lot.\" She said we would need to pay the Thunderbird a partial amount and she would cover the rest. We had to check out by 1:15 so we went back to our room and found the door was open. We told the guy cleaning on our floor that our door was open and he said, \"nothing is going to happen, I'm up here working.\" Thats not the point however. You don't leave a door open for anyone to just walk in. We left the Haven still with no apology. The only thing we got was Babbi complaining about how her employee said \"he didn't make a mistake\" and that \"he needs to own up to his mistakes.\" We couldn't even check in to the Thunderbird till 3pm so we had to figure out how to kill time and waste more of our vacation. Once we got to the Thunderbird and saw the condition, we wouldn't have even paid a penny to stay at this location! We called Babbi immediately and she refused to pay the total amount and said she \"did not have any more petty cash to use.\" The hotel was NOT on the boardwalk like she told us. It wasn't even along the beach. The hotel was VERY dirty! There was old food left in the fridge. All our towels had huge brown stains on them. Our bathtub hadn't been cleaned and had hair in it. I felt disgusting and not relaxed there at all with all the noise coming from all the neighbors. We deserved much better treatment then this! We deserve compensation!!! I want them to give us a comped stay in the room we paid for!! We were treated beyond poorly. This was no vacation! These people need a lesson on customer service. Believe me when I say that Frank, the owner of this hotel will be hearing about this.

I think they need to set a service policy in place to stay consistant. The rooms are huge and very clean! It was more room than I was expecting. The kitchenette was a bonus though I was not expecting it so I didn't use it. The main drawback of this place is the slow elevator serving the floors. It is slow and there is only 1 of them. You are encouraged not to use the stairs so they are not an option but should be since the facility is only 5 floors counting the ground level.

Our six year anniversary was the weekend of April 23rd to April 25th 2010. I decided to spring a bit further forward for the occasion than your typical Quality Inn. Prior to visiting The Haven, I became excited with the room, and quickly booked it. Low and behold, I decided to put in a bit of research. I am not the type of person who thrives from complaining nor do I want to deter you. All I can share about my experience is the truth. What began as a romantic getaway quickly became a major frustration. After driving down to Ocean City, Maryland from Baltimore the driver can become a bit tired. We went to the office to collect our room key, because as stated, we reserved our room. My girlfriend and I are both twenty-one years old, and very mature for our age. We drive down to Ocean City, Maryland and without being told prior, ARE CHARGED $100.00 per person under the age of twenty-five? Let's be serious. When I checked out, I literally had to rely on the credibility of the hotel's room service to get my money back. This was not on the website, nor was it told. Had I not arrived with enough money would I have gotten a refund? Well that's just peanuts to begin with. After receiving some of the worst customer service I have ever seen, I proceeded to carrying my things to my room. Now, the website does explain that the complex has limited parking; there are literally no more than six parking spots beneath the building, all of which seemed to have been taken by the hotel's staff. There IS a parking lot two blocks away at Melvin's Steak House. The parking lot is dirty, trashy, and unguarded and the hotel assumes no responsibility for the vehicles in it. The parking lot is difficult to find at first because the OFFICE staff is not helpful at all. At minimum, they should be required to say \"parking next to Melvin's\". They sat at their desk watching TV with their foreign accents ignorant to the world while I paid their wages. My car's bumper was smashed ridiculously in the middle of the night. I didn't hear it because the parking lot was so far away. Nobody seen or heard anything, so now I'm stuck with paying an extra $200.00 because some drunk moron decided to back into my vehicle. After having to pay the room's fee, the $100.00 per person security deposit, and the $200.00 deductible for the hit and run I suffer, I would have been much better off going to a Quality Inn. The hotel offered no amenities besides a coffee pot with what seemed to be Arabian coffee. Enough to make you vomit. The ice buckets were dirty, there was hair in the shower, the water pressure was terrible. Hot water was limited. There were trash mouthed teenagers on the boardwalk benches out front of our hotel all night long drinking and starting trouble. The room service hardly services your room, and when they do the items they dispense are limited. I waited twenty-four hours for two towels. Now, I'm not sure about most of you but it'd be nice to have towels for BOTH the shower, and the jacuzzi. We had to use the same towel and purchase our own from Sunsations. They literally told me \"we are out of hand towels\" at a hotel. There was candy stuck on one of the blankets from the previous visitors. There were four flat sheets on my bed and not a single fitted sheet. The balcony was disgusting and they are not private at all. If you have neighbors, expect to have to whisper. My neighbor must have been picking crabs before I came down, because I went out in the middle of the night to smoke and there were shells blown all over my balcony. Disgusting people. Aside from the view, I wouldn't let my dog sleep in this hotel. Until the hotel manager gets his head straight, I will do my best to make sure nobody I know stays at The Haven. This hotel is nowhere near modern, everything on their website is false advertisement, and I personally would rather sleep on the beach than stay another night in The Haven. If the hotel manager is reading this and has any means to make this right. Feel free to contact me. [---] For those of you reading this review looking for a nice place to stay for the weekend I would strong advise The Spinnaker. I frequent Ocean City and visit almost every three weeks. =D I like to try out new places, but if ever dissatisfied I go back there. The room is stocked with a full kitchen, beautiful side view of the ocean almost unflawed, great access to a lot of nearby restaurants and activities, and most of all FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL SERVICE.", "Date": "April 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "baltimore city", "Title": "\u201cDO NOT STAY AT THE HAVEN\u201d", "Author": "hollyBaltimoreCity", "ReviewID": "UR39113403", "Content": "One word, \"DIRTY!\" The whole place was sticky and musty and we were afraid to take our shoes off.

They would not let me get it until I checked out. The room was not even equipped with a hair dryer, alarm clock, etc., and was very dirty. There was a clothes rack but no clothes hangers and when we received an attitude when they were requested. We requested an extra blanket and they said it was not possible. I booked the room for four people and there was only two towels in our room. I requested to be provided with at least four towels the rest of my stay and couldn't even get that. When I checked out, I became aware that we were being accused of stealing towels when we never had enough to begin with. A roommate of ours lost his key card to get into the room and the lady at the front desk would not give him another one so he could get in or even call us (since we were sleeping and didn't hear him knock) to make sure he was with us.

Arrived about 2:30 PM on Thursday and the room was ready. Upon entering the very small (OF Efficiency) room we found the room to be reasonably clean, however the carpet was not vacuumed very well. A call to the front desk and housekeeping showed up right away to vacuum. Over the 3 nights at Haven, we found the room to be comfortable, quiet for being right on the Boardwalk, great location, but few amenities other than a small refridgerator. No microwave, coffee maker, or alarm clock. The only problems we had were spotty housekeeping as the carpet was again not regularly vacuumed, and the bed sheets could stand to be replaced, as you could see the bleached out stains in them. Overall, I would rate the Haven Hotel as average or very slightly above. The location is great, it is reasonably quiet, and a good value for the price.

When we return on our next vacation to Ocean City Maryland, we will definitely be staying again at.....The Haven Hotel!", "Date": "August 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cgreat location!\u201d", "Author": "rojaji", "ReviewID": "UR8452478", "Content": "I had a great experience, and found the staff to be really nice!

No it doesn't have a pool or a big lobby to hang out in but who needs that at the beach. We had an oceanfront effcy and it was awesome. The room was huge and beds comfortable. It was clean and the housekeeping was on the rooms early so by the time you got back from breakfast or the beach your room was cleaned. The kitchen area had a small fridge which kept things really cold, the a/c was super good, it also had a microwave and a large coffeemaker, sink and some cabinets. Everything we needed. The staff was very friendly and helpful. It is located on 1st street and the boards so it is right in the middle of everything, but yet at night when you closed your balconey door you couldn't hear a thing. The soundproofing in the hotel is unreal good. I never heard the boards or even another soul in that hotel the whole week we where there. I had read other reviews complaining about the parking situation and all I can say is I guess you can't please some folks. They have about 8 spots and 2 handicaps under the hotel which out of the 6 days we where there we found open about 4 of those days and the extra parking is on 1st and Philly right next to Melvins Steakhouse. It is a very short 2 blk walk. We had a great stay and we will be booking again there next year.", "Date": "August 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cloved it\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4724655", "Content": "we stayed at this hotel 2-17 to 2-19-2006,,,were very pleased. we needed late check in and had no problem with that. when we arrived staff was very pleasant.. we got to our room, which was very nice.the hotel and staff were all we expected and we would gladly reccomend and stay there again..", "Date": "March 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cnever again at the Haven\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4722581", "Content": "We wanted to be as far down the boardwalk as possible to fish at the inlet so the Haven was thought to be a great place.

It was absolutely disgusting that we ended up cleaning what we could while we were there. Also, there was no alarm clock, hairdryer, or iron.
