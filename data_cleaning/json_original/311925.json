There's a huge hot breakfast buffet included in the price of the room.

I checked out their website I was thrilled, but like many reviews the rooms were spartan to say it kindly. I appreciated the change to a different location at I paid $36/night to be there. A few minor problems I had was during check-in the front desk staff had the wrong pricing for my booking, they said it was $83, I told them it was $36, they said they would check the reservation, asked for my credit card number, it lefted me a bit nearvous either way. The room was clean on my arrival, there was no TV in the room nor hangers in my room, luckily I travelled with some as I read in previous reviews. No mircowave or mini fridge, I found some located down the hall, there is a standard size fridge so leaving food or drink is cautionary. I stayed 14 days, on day 10 they offered to clean my room, maybe due to the G20 they didn't offer beforehand. They was lots of college students around, so it was noisy at times, overall not too bad. I didn't like the fact after 10PM it was required to show your room key to the security guard, it felt like being at the airport the whole time I stayed there. Overall, it was a complete nightmare of a stay, I liked the location less than a 10 min walk to Eaton Centre, a city bus stop is 5 mins away. If you take the Airporter from the airport, they do have a stop in front of the hotel.

Anyone who is looking for a \"hotel\" experience, please move along, there is nothing to see here.

Housekeeping once a week (yes, you read that correctly, once a WEEK).

There is a difference between \"spartan\" and \"a bargain\" and \"dingy\" and \"run down\". For instance: cheap, hand-me-down furnishings -- \"spartan\" BUT peeling paint and wallpaper, dirty windows and towels and questionable linens -- \"run down\" and \"dingy\". 3.) Card key system for getting into rooms and using elevators is a joke. Apparently your card can be desensitized by cell phones, magnets, other cards in your wallet, fresh air, sunlight and just about any environment outside of the \"residence\" itself. 4.) The breakfast buffet was the typical limp bacon, greasy sausage, cold pancakes and eerie-looking eggs that you would expect to find at any university setting...in retrospect, I shouldn't have been surprised. 5.) ZERO amenities! I mean, none...no TV, no iron, no ice machines, no soda machines, no mini-fridges. Again, if you were a student, you would probably bring many of these things to the \"residence,\" but as a traveler, well, you're out of luck! 6.) The toilet, which had to be flushed twice for every one time you wanted it flushed. What is this, a dorm...oh wait, IT IS! On the few plus sides: 1.) The technical staff was great. We couldn't get our internet to work, and he came up to our room multiple times with different cords and modems and eventually got everything to work. 2.) The view (at least from our room) was great...the CN Tower and Canada Life Building both in view, if you could see them through the aforementioned dirty windows...

By virtue of it being housed in a tower block that used to be a hotel, 89 Chestnut is like no university hall of residence I have seen before. The rooms are huge. My room 1850, on the 18th floor overlooking City Hall and the CN Tower had a view to die for, a large comfortable double bed, two wardrobes, an easy chair, a desk with swivel chair, and hotel style ensuite bathroom with underfloor heating taking the chill off the tiles.

Its primary function is as a University Residence. Thus, especially if you're living there for short-term during the school year, it will NOT be a hotel experience. During the summer, very few students stay there and it's converted to be used partly as a hotel...although don't expect it to be 4 stars or anything of the like. If you're looking for something more high class, check into the hotel across the street. Front desk is usually pretty nice if you phone them concerning any problems. They will usually send someone up to fix the problem within a reasonable amount of time. TVs are not available b/c during the school year, they do not want to provide students with a TV. However, cable is free and if you have a laptop that's capable of being hooked up, that's what you can do. Having to take off your coat and leave your bags in the cubby holes are only during the school year b/c they are paranoid about students sneaking food outside since it is an all-you-can-eat meal plan. There are no meal plans during the summer. If you're staying during the school year, the microwave and fridge can be found in the common room on each floor (you access thsi w/your room key), although the fridge can get quite nasty. If I'm not mistaken, a lot of budget accomodations do not provide personal fridges and microwaves within the rooms anyway. There is an exercise room on the 4th floor, but no pool. They took it out in 2006 due to high costs and lack of use. It was a really small pool anyway. I'm sure all the positive comments about summer time occupance are valid. For the comments from people that stayed during the school year, trust me, go to a hotel if you're not prepared for residence life.

Keep in mind that most of the great reviews are from visitors who stayed there during the summer and perhaps I had a totally different experience b/c I was a short term guest there during U of T school year when it was being used as a student residence... A. What I did not like about this so-called \"hotel\": (1) I paid $1200 dollars for 2 weeks short term stay and for my terrible experience that was WAY over what I should have paid. Had I not paid the non-refundable deposit in advance, I would have left after the first night (2) When I got to my room, I found several pubic hairs in the bath tub (it was far from being *clean*) (3) The toilet did not flush (4) For over 60-70% of the time, I had to take COLD shower b/c there was no warm water - this is absolutely unacceptable! (5) The NOISE... the university students were VERY noisy (e.g. very loud music until 3am, someone played guitar every night around midnight, etc.) and there is one door between your room and the next so you can hear their conversation and a lot more all night. (6) Your room is cleaned only once/week. There is no info sheet on where you can find more towels, etc. Nobody is there to empty your garbage that piles up. (7) The cafeteria access: There are these *strict rules* that you have to abide by: you have to take off your jacket, you are not allowed to bring in your bag into the cafeteria for breakfast (i felt like I was in a boot camp) (8) There is NO refrigerator, microwave, no access to drinking water/ice anywhere on the floor (at least I wasn't told about it!) B. What I liked about the hotel: (1) The high-speed internet access (included) (2) The very friendly front desk staff (3) Amazingly good location to the subway (2 blocks away from St.Patrick's station), and major amenities in downtown. (4) Tons of places to eat around the hotel My final advice: If you can afford it, go somewhere else. Some of the nicer hotels have similar deals.

The staff were friendly and approachable, and the room we arrived to was clean. Someone earlier had written that you could help yourself to towels and toilet rolls since housekeeping is only twice a week, but when I asked about this I was told it was not the case. However, reception brought some up for us within minutes of asking. Breakfast was excellent. There was a wide choice available. Cereals, lots of different breads, some fruit, hot breakfast, and plenty fruit juice. They even had ice cream. The problem we had was that on the website it said they were doing refurbishment over the summer period. I emailed in and asked them to clarify this, but received no reply. We were booking last minute so we got to the stage where we had to book and so went ahead. Now, if the room along the corridor is being painted, it's not likely to bother me. But a JACKHAMMER going.....I have a problem with that!!!! There were signs up about this, but you don't see them by the lift until you've checked in. We had checked into the room when we came back out and saw the sign saying that certain rooms would be affected. So we asked to change rooms. The new room was at the other side of the hotel and one floor up - all they could give us. But it was still a problem for the first few hours of the day and late afternoon. I was pregnant at the time, so wanted to lie down sometimes. Of course, you're out most of the day. But they said they'd be doing it from 9AM-5PM each day. So when I was woken up at 8:30am one morning, I phoned reception and complained. This was met with bewilderment as they seemed unaware of the work going on?!? Strange. So what I would say, is for the price, this is a great place to stay. But if you see ANYTHING on the website about upgrading the hotel, then make sure you phone and clarify.

Proper Canadian rules and regulations. That's really why we went there. Room was excellent. Location couldn't be better. A/C a little noisy during the night...but a few beers and earplugs put paid to that. if you have loads of money, book a top hotel. If you are mid range, grab this. TOP TIP...Go for the full hot breakfast. Without doubt, the breakfast here is the best you will find in North America or Europe. If you are budgeting for food, have this breakfast, and add 10 bucks a head for a coffee and sandwich that evening. it really is that good.

We were going to be in Toront a few weeks before, so we decided to stay there instead of a regular hotel. We had two adjoining rooms with a south view of the city looking over Nathan Phillips square so there were lots of trees and the CN tower was in the view. Comfortable, clean air-conditioned rooms and the shower had invigorating water pressure. You couldn't ask for a better downtown location - the Eaton Centre, Queen St. and the subway very close and great restaurants all around. Walking distance to the theatres, Yonge St, University of Toronto and just about everything. Price about $80 Canadian for two including an OK continental breakfast with option to upgrade to a great hot breakfast. Excellent security and underground parking. We didn't miss the TV - in 8 days I went out a couple times to the Common room on the floor to watch the news. My son lives there now for the academic year and loves it.
