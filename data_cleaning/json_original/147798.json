The suite on the top floor has very tall ceilings and great airflow- we only used the air conditioner once and turned it off after determining it really wasn't necessary. At night there are a lot of creature noises, so if you are a sensitive sleeper you might want the a/c. The location of this hotel is superior - located very close to Esperanza, which is where we chose to enjoy most of our meals. Looking back, had we picked a hotel farther from Esperanza, I think I would not have enjoyed our trip as much. You must rent a car while here to fully experience the island. The beach down the hill from the hotel is great for exploring, though I would not recommend it for swimming due to rocks and sea urchins. With a car, there are other beaches very close that are perfect for swimming, so I wouldn't consider this an issue. The hotel was very charming- wonderful setting, great staff- Ivan actually reserved our flights from the mainland and our car rental and was so patient with our multiple questions and requests. Teresa arranged for dinner for us for several nights. The breakfast staff are so pleasant and accomodating. Zack, the resident sheepdog exuded charm and provided entertainment while \"herding\" horses off the property and graciously letting everyone pet him at every turn. The staff and the owners really make the property. We found the pool plenty warm enough to swim in. There are floats that can be used for lounging in the pool and reading a book all day without fully committing to getting in the water if temperature is an issue. There were no tvs in the room and wi-fi did not work unless in the library. From my perspective this was a positive - teenager read 3 books in a week which would not have likely happened with a tv or wi-fi! It was also great because I could truly unplug from work unless I really needed to check in. Breakfast was delicious. Spicy hash browns were a favorite of mine mixed with scrambled eggs. Our daughter's only complaint was that the specials were typically egg based and she would have loved more pancake / waffle based specials. There were cranberry walnut pancakes on special one day we were there, served with Vermont Maple Syrup. The packed lunches provided by the hotel were great- a generous amount of food and I would highly recommend. You order in the kitchen the night before and pick up in the morning. We only did this one day, but probably should have done it every day given how much we seemed to spend on lunch when we went out! Overall, I can see why this hotel is #1 on Trip Advisor, however if you are looking for an experience like at the W- you won't find it here. In my opinion, you will have a better time at Hacienda Tamarindo (and we toured the W and had lunch there), but it is a very different experience - no comparison. I say this only to give context to the review. The W looked to me to be more \"luxury\" but luxury that could have been anywhere. I would describe Hacienda Tamarindo as rustic island chic - an authentic vacation.

With that said, we found the Hacienda to have a kind of dark, dilapidated feel to it. Some might call it funky, but it's not quite that. We had what I would probably call the best room in the place, with a balcony. However, the view towards the sea is kind of scrubby and the deck chairs painfully uncomfortable. The room itself is dark and when the weather turned bad, it was not a place to spend time in. Both my husband and I felt confined. The bed is uncomfortable. The quality of the linens is poor and the mattress is just not inviting. I know to expect mosquitos here and there, but there were a significant number and we got quite bitten--even with the doors closed. The catch-22, is that by closing the door, the room feels like a cell. The bathroom is barely tolerable. Tiny with a sink outside in the room. The breakfasts are well-meaning--everyone is well-meaning--but really unimaginative and we chose to eat at the one other place \"in town\" that serves breakfast. They do pack a picnic lunch--which is a benefit. Although, again, it is just OK. We found Vieques itself, to be somewhat depressing. There are many properties for sale and even the Hacienda has a for sale sign up, although I didn't inquire if indeed it is. The island used to be off-limits and used for test-bombing. When it ultimately opened for tourism, it just doesn't seem to have come into its own. Believe me, neither my husband nor myself like high-rise, glitzy hotels, however, there is a vast difference between that and a place that feels alive. Even the beaches, which are indeed deserted, which should be nice right? Well, they seem odd. There is one beach with a sign that says something to the effect of: do not tresspass into the woods because there may be buried explosives. We took a kayaking excursion to the Bioluminescent Bay with Abe's. I don't recommend them. Our guide was sarcastic, complained he had not eaten, and people were herded along like numbers which ruined the beauty of the experience. I hear there is a glass-bottomed kayak experience. I would suggest this instead. Again, there is nothing terrible at all about the Hacienda and nothing terrible about the island, it is just feels charmless, colorless and semi-abandoned(as opposed to romantic and remote). On the other hand, it could be just us. I know that many people who have come here love the experience. Certainly, the price is right.

Truth be told, I'm a repeat visitor, having stayed here 11 times over as many years (this is being written at my breakfast table, so like the food, this review is being served up fresh). This might qualify me to observe the consistency and continuity of this charming B&B to which the management has adhered. I don't think Tripadvisor existed 11 years ago, but if it had, and I had written a review then, it would be pretty much the same as the one I write today. And from where I sit, that's all good. Many have written about the charming building in which Hacienda Tamarindo is housed, with the Tamarind tree rising up from the lobby and through the second-floor dining area (under which I am happy to be sitting). The pool is small but intimate, with an incredible view of green pastures, complete with wild horses, flowing down to meet the Atlantic Ocean. The rooms are tastefully and artfully decorated, and having stayed in several different rooms over the years, I can say that, while the views can change from room to room, the overall experience from each is on par with all. The breakfast that is served each morning is always excellent, and the staff has always been caring and attentive. There is an honor bar in the lobby (reminiscent of days gone by, when people actually trusted one another) that's stocked with a full assortment of waters, spirits, beer and wine. And the grounds are well kept and beautiful, with an occasional hammock here and there. Is it perfect? Well, no, but what is? However, to my mind, it approaches perfection in many ways, and while my wife and I could have stayed at many other places on Vieques over the years, Hacienda Tamarindo has kept us coming back, and will continue to do so.

Expectations were high after reading the reviews here. We had trouble getting from the airport to the hotel as the car rental agency was closed (we arrived at 6 pm) . We ended up sharing a publico but did not get to the hotel until after 7, very tired after traveling all day. In an interesting \"welcome\", the reception desk is behind a big clear plastic sliding window, giving more the impression that I was at a police station than an inn. The first order of business as part of our \"welcome\" is to pay our bill. Not just \"we have you staying for 6 days at $300\" like every other place I have ever stayed,but actually charging us for the next 6 days before we have even seen our room. We were not happy. All that said, we did get a little tour and the hotel is definitely quirky but cool and relaxing. The location is great and in the morning we saw the great views, including from our room. The room was clean but I agree with the other comment that the sheets are well-worn and don't stay on because the elastic is worn. The bath and lighting fixtures are dated/worn, as well. It's great that they give you beach towels, beach chairs and a cooler but the chairs are also well-worn. Overall, I get the sense that updating is not a high priority. Also, bring your own shampoo and lotion. There is a plastic dispenser in the shower for soap and shampoo that is not very good. The water pressure and hot water are great though. Breakfast was very good, and the fresh juices were great. Expected more of a fruit selection, since two of the days the only available fruit was: bananas.

The only downside (and this wasn't the hotel's fault) was that we could hear some distant loud music from the bars in Esperanza, although that was a very minor issue.

Despite dire predictions on weather.com, the weather was very nice. We only had rain one night, while eating dinner. The Inn has many gracious touches, including beach chairs, a cooler, and beach towels in the room. The morning full breakfast on the patio is a lovely touch, and provides excellent value. The pool is quite lovely and overlooks the Caribbean. The owners were gracious and charming and made some excellent suggestions on restaurants. Jim (who worked at the front desk) was particularly helpful and always gave us good information on where to go and what to see. Vieques is a beautiful, wild island. Driving is not for the faint of heart. The roads are narrow and rutted, vegetation grows abundantly, and horses tend to wander about nearly everywhere. But a car is a must! The Hacienda is about a mile from the smaller of the two towns on Vieques, and there is a fairly nice selection of places to eat there. Our personal favorite was the Tradewinds (recommended by Burr, the Inn's owner). The food is very good, the service is pleasant and the views are outstanding (right over the Caribbean). If you are looking for luxury and are used to 5 star resorts, then don't go to Vieques. With the possible exception of The W (on the windward side of the island), you won't find it. However, if you want to go to unspoiled beaches and enjoy some solitude, this may be the place. The staff at the Inn took care of all details for us, including having a rental car at the Inn for us when we checked in (we arrived at the airport at about 6:00 p.m., apparently too late for the rental car facility to be open). Getting to the Inn from the airport was challenging. Be forewarned, you have to call a cab from a list they provide. Our driver, Jorge, was very nice and recommended we go the town square on Saturday in Isabel Segunda to see the tree lighting. That was the only bit of \"culture\" we ever saw (as most places are run by and staffed by Americans). The Christmas tree was entirely comprised of water and pop bottles wired together! Very clever and actually pretty. The square was crowded and everyone seemed to be having a great time. We went back there a few nights later and it was nearly empty, but we went into the Catholic church by the square, where they were singing the rosary in Spanish. We were graciously welcomed to join and it was quite lovely. We went on the much hyped kayak trip on the bio-luminescent bay. Interesting but not our favorite experience. Finally, the guide books warned about theft and recommend not locking the car; however, we did not have any problems in this regard. Most locals were friendly and helpful. Also be aware that the bugs are everywhere and bug spray is a must.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cVery nice property and friendly staff!!\u201d", "Author": "juicetropics40", "ReviewID": "UR121384825", "Content": "My stay here was very comfortable.

I would describe this as more of a B&B. If you are expecting to find resort type properties on this island, the only one out there is the W. This is a place to unplug from electronics and enjoy the natural beauty of the beaches, crystal clear waters, bio bay and beach bars. It's not really about the hotel, resort, pools, etc... Plan to have a car and travel to the beautiful beaches on this island. The positives about Hacienda Tamarindo: the honor bar was different and gave the hotel a homey feel. Fresh beach towels, cooler, and beach chairs provided in the room was convenient. The bagged lunches that were able to be ordered the night before were good for daily beach trips and were reasonably priced ($8-9.00 daily per person). Pool was kept fairly clean and it was nice to have a place on the property to hang out if you didn't want to be at the beach. Blue Horizon is literally in the back yard of this property and was within walking distance for dinner or to go to the bar there. This property was a good distance from the noise of the Malecon but close enough that it didn't take long to get to downtown or to visit the more popular beaches. Negatives: Probably my biggest complaint would be that the bed was two twin mattresses put together with a foam pad on top to join them together so they looked like a king sized bed. The sheets, mattress pad and bed covers were old/outdated. The sheets did not fit the mattress and had lost elasticity so the sheets popped off during the night every night and you ended up sleeping on the foam pad - ICK! The bed was comfortable enough but I thought that the least they could do would be to provide decent bed coverings. The pool area had lounge chairs but they were so outdated that the oxidation from the chairs ended up on your body if you sat in them. The rooms were in dire need of an update - walls and ceilings needed painting and you just never felt like the bathroom was clean. At night we saw mice scampering around in the honor bar area. At first we thought they were geckos, but they were mice. Though the property had some nice plantings around the pool area, it was otherwise without landscaping. It could use a path from the house to the pool. We did have missing money but did not have any proof so we didn't mention it. Now that I see that others had the same experience, I'm guessing that staff took ours as well. The breakfast in the morning was good but we found the staff there to be unfriendly and cold. Overall we enjoyed our time on the island and enjoyed the relaxed feel. I agree that a room safe would add to the comfort of this property. No one wants to have to go to the office and bother someone to get their belongings and be confined to access during business hours. Quality bedding would also be a huge plus.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington VT", "Title": "\u201cA great place\u201d", "Author": "Daniel_Sch", "ReviewID": "UR121205153", "Content": "Our family of 4 stayed here for a few nights and enjoyed our stay. It's expensive. Our 2 room suite (a king bed, and 2 singles) was $270 + $35 per kid extra, plus a mandatory 10% service fee, plus PR taxes. By the time we finished everything, it was close to $400 per night for a room with no view, which compares to a nice hotel in any major US city. The location is out of town, so you will be dependent on your car for almost everything. While we were there, two guests (that we know of, maybe there were more) had money stolen out of their locked rooms; we didn't have an issue. Theft out of cars is a huge problem in Vieques, and we passed about a dozen cars in our travels that had windows smashed out (we had no problems). People refers to bricks as the \"Vieques Master Car Key\", and it seems like theft from tourists is not viewed as a problem since it affects tourists mostly. Honestly, I found it stressful constantly worrying about theft from my locked car and my locked room. Breakfast was nice, as you would expect. The view is superb, and the pool is pretty and infrequently used. Bring bug spray if you intend to spend time at the pool at dusk. Vieques is beautiful and it's great place to find undiscovered beaches that look like they were plucked from a \"best beaches of the world\" book. One note...everybody that we met on Vieques speaks English, and there really isn't a cultural component to Vieques. Everyone we met (with the exception of Abe) was from the USA. I was hoping to expose my kids to another culture, but it really felt like being in the US, at least culturally. We did Esperanza Riding Company one evening, which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. We did a snorkeling tour through Abe's, which was the highlight of our trip as we did the adventurous tour and saw some beaches that we way off the beaten path.

It was wonderful! We stayed in a Carribean Deluxe room (can't remember number, but I'm pretty sure it is the one pictured in the virtual tour on their website.) The views from the balcony were gorgeous. While we didn't spend too much time out there, I appreciated having an outdoor space with my room. The room itself was great, plenty of room, double vanities and comfy bed. We did use the A/C at various times, which worked very well. Breakfast was nice, as well as the option for a packed lunch. We did utilize this one day for the beach and it was super convenient. The honor bar is also nice to have available. Having beach chairs, towels and a cooler for the beach in the room was also a huge plus. It was so easy just to hop in the car and start exploring the island. Our reservation included a car rental from Maritza's, so we didn't have to worry about setting that up. This was our first trip to Vieques, and after seeing the island, I felt the location in Esparanza was a good choice. There are several restaurants and bars on the main strip in town, which was just a few minutes in the car. We drove through Isabel Segunda one day, and didn't care for the \"bustling\" atmosphere. Also, Esperanza's side of the island (Carribean) has the majority of beaches where you will spend your time, with several only 5-10 minutes from the hotel. Due to the time of year, a few restaurants we attempted to make reservations at were closed. However, it was no big deal, as there was still many options available. The plus of visiting during the off season is the likelihood of being one of only a few people, or the only ones on a beach! I thought this was amazing and something I had never experienced before. The discounted rates at this time of year are also a definite plus. The staff was great, very nice and informative. Received good advice regarding tours and restaurants. (Loved Next Course and Duffy's for food, and Vieques Adventure Company's clear canoes for Biobay tour.) We booked the room only about 2 weeks before traveling, and making the reservation via email was a breeze. Our only regret was not staying longer.

There is a self serve wine bar and recreational type room after hours (you are given the key to access during check in). The hotel trusts you to accurately track what you have taken from the bar by logging it in a journal near the bar, your room will be charged accordingly.

You really get the full experience of being out in the wilderness and removed from urban civilization. One really creative touch that each hotel room had are journals for all visitors to submit an entry and not only share their experience in La Hacienda but also their experience in general on the Island of Vieques. I spent one night reading two journals in our room (who needs a TV when you have these journals!!). Your stay includes a complimentary breakfast served on the top floor of the hotel - restaurant style. You are also able to place an order for a \"bag of lunch\" to take with you on the road. I can't recall if this was included. I think this is an additional charge but its a service that is well worth taking advantage of if you have a jam packed itinerary for the day.

I have also reviewed other sites during this trip including a nice stay at The Gallery in San Juan. PR's Rough Guide provided the information that led to many of our travel choices this visit. Note that the Hacienda has their own website but doesn't appear to be on the big travel sites. The grounds are clean and attractive with lush but well maintained tropical plantings. A large tamarind tree grows in the lobby and through an opening in the upper floor. The building is open and inviting. The inn has a pool, and though we didn't get time to use it, it was a nice looking amenity. A salon with an 'honor-bar' including top shelf liquors is another good option that we did not get a chance to make use of. We stayed in the Vermont room, a High Standard type. Because it was one of the least expensive options, we were pleasantly surprised to find the lower level room had views to the Caribbean Sea. The space was very clean and relatively large with a king bed and small balcony. The price, for the room alone reasonable for many areas at less than $150 per night (w/o taxes which range from 15-20%, high, across PR), also included a full breakfast. This was not a buffet, but cooked to order plates with sides, fresh fruit, and a variety of juices. The open air, mostly covered dining area is on the upper level. On top of the value and amenities, one of our most positive experiences at Hacienda was with the management and owner . Our check in started with a tour of the facility and room, a great little detail new to us. The day manager we interacted with most was very friendly, arranged for us to take a bioluminescent bay tour, and seemed genuinely interested in us having a good stay. When checking out our rental car battery had died and he jumped it for us right away. For that matter, almost everyone we met there, including the owner who apparently is very involved and lives on site, seemed to put the visitor experience above the bottom line. Negatives? The closest things to issues from our stay were very few. Before arriving they recommended an island car rental company that turned out to be by far our biggest downer. Because the windows along two walls (and the bathroom door) are louvered wood (with a metal screen to keep mosquitos out) the privacy of the rooms is somewhat limited - sound, not visual. This wasn't much of an issue for us, but when background noises are low, you may be able to hear into the lobby and some other rooms. There is noone manning the lobby desk between 5 pm and 8 am. This was not really a problem for us, though when the room hair dryer malfunctioned we had to just do without. We understand the owners are available from their rooms for emergencies. For all of these reasons we enjoyed our short stay and highly recommend the Hacienda to others visiting Esperanza. [Side note, we suggest anyone going to Puerto Rico take a two day (or longer) jaunt out to Vieques. Flying via Cape Air from SJU to VQS is a safe 25 minute prop flight.

I'm not sure if it's not as well maintained, but the entrance felt rustic and I had a foreboding feeling as we apparoached the door. There must have been 30-40 mosquitoes in the room. I killed 10 in the first 5 minutes we were there and there were still plenty flying around (not to mention spiders and regular flies). I'm very well traveled in the tropics, and I understand that part of the beauty on a place like Vieques is that it is a wild island, so naturally some bugs, lizards, etc. might enter a property or room. That said, for $200 a night, you would expect the insides of the rooms to be mostly bug-free. The decor and sheets were dated and not appealing at all. Luckily, we were moved to a 2-room suite in the main building, which was just behind the kitchen. The main room was beautiful and largely bug free - large ceilings, lots of light, great bedsheets, but we were only there for 36 hours and had already lost time and energy moving things around. The second room in the suite, where you enter, was dark and dingy - glad we were not sleeping there and didn't have to spend any time in there. The breakfast was below average, nothing to justify the price. The facility itself was OK - it could have been even nicer but is not kept up well (sort of like most things on the island). The pool and the view are quite nice - probably the nicest things about this property - though the chairs next to them are dirty and not relaxing to sit on. We met the owner the day before we checked out, and we asked him if we could check out early since we were leaving the next morning at 8AM. He seemed peeved that he had to come downstairs from his penthouse lair, and then said he wished we had sorted things out earlier if we knew in advance we were going to be leaving early!? (Someone works at the front desk for a limited number of hours each day, and outside that time the owners have to deal with issues). We felt like we were being reprimanded by our boss, instead of being made to feel comfortable on our vacation... he complained that the computers were off and he \"didn't feel like turning them on again\"... It seemed to us that the owners have moved here for their retirement but don't actually want to be bothered by the task of running a guesthouse. In comparison, the lady at the front desk who moved us into the cleaner room was lovely and helpful. The island of Vieques is on the one hand beautiful, but on the other hand can be stressful (especially if you're only there for a few days) because there is still little infrastructure on the island, and things and people move at a slow pace. This was our second time to Vieques and since we were only there for 2 days, we would have been better off staying at a relaxing hotel instead of a \"do-it-yourself\", no-frills place.

When calling to make arrangements I spoke to both Joey and Tonya who were both incredibly helpful in advising us and offering various options. Upon arriving we were given a brief tour of the hotel and then shown our room. The place is beautiful and we loved the room immediately. Everything was meticulously decorated and landscaped telling us that the owners take pride in their hotel. They have also thought of many little extras that other hotels might not consider... things that just make your stay in a far off place that much nicer. They offer a library where you can relax after hours outside of your room. You can borrow a book or use their house computer. There is an honor bar where you can buy drinks and snacks and charge them to your room by writing them down in a book. This is nice if you just want to get out of the room for a bit. My only complaints are minor and are just things that were not made clear to us. The honor bar is closed and locked after hours. After an evening excursion to the Bio-Bay we were looking forward to coming back and having a nice drink before bed... only to find it locked up. Rather disappointing and we really weren't in the mood to go back out to the bars. Also when we checked in we were not given the password for the internet access. There is no mention of a password in the room book or anywhere else that I could find. It was only 8:30PM so I called once trying to reach the owners upstairs and also tried the intercom. No one answered either time. Not an emergency to be without internet access on vacation... but again, a bit of a disappointment that could easily have been avoided. Frankly I don't understand the need for such high security in their remote location but I assume there must be a reason for it. I should also say that the bed was very uncomfortable... the worst in all 4 places we stayed in Puerto Rico. But we did request two beds and 2 twins were the only option available. I suspect their larger beds MUST be better? Service at the hotel is WAY above average. Tonya did everything she could to make us feel welcome and also directed us to several great restaurants (Loved Bananas!). She also helped us book our Bio-bay tour and was very helpful in finding us a car rental when we didn't know to plan far enough in advance. The restaurant staff is also friendly and professional... and of course the breakfast is just delicious. We did not take advantage of the packed lunches but we saw a few and they looked very tasty.

And that doesn't include all of the wonderful breakfasts we had with Rosita (the Hacienda parrot) and Zach, the incredibly friendly and cool sheep dog. A vacation we and our kids will never forget. Highly recommend the Island Adventure biobay tour. I have to think the pontoon boat is better than the kayaks. Go for it!!!! We also did a ton of snorkeling while on the island. We kayaked over to and snorkeled at the island across from the downtown esparanza area. Great time! Also highly recommend making a drive to Green Beach on eastern tip of island - we stumbled on to a giant sea turtle, a wonderful reef for snorkeling - all kinds of fish, and even had a very cool encounter with a 3+' barracuda. Kind of stepping outside our safety zone, but we were never afraid and will never forget the experience. You'll also need to drive east and check out Blue Beach (absolutely beautiful). Make sure you take lots of insect spray - the skeeters will eat you alive. Ran into a Ray at Blue Beach. One in our party hired a fishing guide and had a blast wade fishing for bonefish (caught the biggest of his life). Saw a few sharks and a manattee while fishing as well. Also, quick caution on renting cars on Vieques, even those the good folks at the Hacienda recommend. I read that rentals were risky on Vieques, so I got anal about the reservations and made them way in advance. Then, called tthree times the weeks leading up to our trip (iincluding the day before) and received confirmation every time that our car was ready. I was nervous that they would not give me a reservation number, but since they read my name each time, I felt okay about. Once there, the chumps had no records at all of me ever calling. A HUGE thank you to the manager of the Hacienda for helping us out!!!!!! If you go to Vieques, don't expect a 5 star hotel or treatment from anyone. Great food in Esparanza!!

We arranged our rental car through them and it was waiting for us when we arrived from the airport. Even Zach, the resident dog, is charming. The breakfasts are wonderful and served in a lovely atmosphere by a warm staff. Our favorite restaurant is El Quenepo.In fact, we ate there 3 times. The menu is so varied and there are so many daily specials that we kept going back to try something different. The food is excellent and well presented. Kate is the owner along with her husband who is the chef. She supervises everything in the restaurant and has a very smart and attentive waitstaff. Next on our list is Coconuts, where we ate twice. The atmosphere is fairly basic, but the food is great, the people are friendly, and it is a fun place to eat. We tried Next Course and had a good meal, but they are still getting themselves organized. We ate lunch and dinner at Bravo Beach Hotel where the restaurant has just recently re-opened. The setting is beautiful and food was very good. Lunch at Duffy's was good and it is a fun spot to watch the world go by. I strongly recommend checking the Newsletter \"Vieques Events\" for activiites. It is available on line at http://www.viequesevents.net or at the Vieques Conservation and Historic Trust in Esperanza, at hotels and various other spots on the island. We found a house tour sponsored by the Trust. It was fascniating to see some of the homes on the island and a lot of people on the tour were residents. The last stop was the W Hotel. It will be very interesting to see how well the hotel does. The setting is beautiful and the design is very sleek. However, there is nothing about it that looks very particular to Vieques or even the Caribbean. The Trust has a regular schedule of interesting events and a small but very nice gift shop on an island without very many shopping opportunities. Our favorite beach is Sun Bay since it is shady and expansive for long walks. We also went to Secret Beach and Navio, which are both good for swimming. Another nice benefit to staying at Hacienda Tamarindo is that they provide beach chairs and packed lunches are available. We would go to the beach every day from about 10 -2 and then head back and relax at the pool for the rest of the afternoon. There is an honor bar so you can enjoy cocktails on the veranda overlooking the water before heading out to dinner. We have been to St. John many times and this island must be like what St. John was 50 years ago. There is not a lot of action which is specifically why we like it: no cruise ships and no casinos.

They made a reservation for us with Maritza rent-a-car before we arrived ($50 a day for a nice little Suzuki SX4 hardtop, almost new, one of several in the parking lot when we got there). Maritza requires that you take a publico (van) from the airport to its offices (5-10 minute ride, $5 per person) to pick up the car, but they give you a ride to the airport when you return it. Tamarindo also made restaurant reservations, luminescent bay reservations, etc. The Island - We came through San Juan Int. airport and flew U.S. Air, that connected at an adjacent ticket desk/gate with Cape Air. Very convenient, but SUBSTANTIALLY more expensive than if we took a publico to another local airport that had air service to Vieques (friends who stayed a few days in San Juan took that option to go to Vieques). You can't buy duty free for the flight from San Juan to Vieques, but we bought at duty free price, a good bottle of gin at the large nicely stocked supermarket up outside of Isabel (near the only two gas stations on the island-there is a sister supermarket in downtown Isabel as well). We also bought drinks, snacks, etc. there. We found two restaurants to be comparable in quality (high) and price (high) to good mainland restaurants. El Quenipo is a consensus best, but Next Course is very close to it in quality (and price). The rest of our eating places had good pub food (Bili and Duffy's in Esperanza) and up and coming Conuco in Isabel (mostly Puerto Rican fare, too much fried, only open some days). Also in Isabel, Coconuts has good food, but great homemade ice cream, that we'd go to just for dessert. Beaches- We prefer a little shade, so we liked Blue Beach, Media Luna, and Secret Beach, which have some spots with trees a few yards up from the sand, although there are prickly burrs on the ground, so some might find they need to wear beach shoes until they reach the full sand on the beach. Blue Beach has a very shallow drop-off so you can walk out waist high for 50 yards and snorkel to an island a couple of hundred yards off shore in water that you can stand up in most of the way out there. We saw some fish near that island, and two rays, one about 6 ft wide. Blue, and several other beaches are accessed by turning off the main paved road and going through the entrance to the nature preserve and driving down a wide dirt road (there are signs). all of the beaches are great though, and not crowded. What Else- We went to Luminescent Bay, using one of the services that provides two person kayaks, $30/person cash. You do have to slather yourself first with an oily rmosquito repellant (guide provided) but it is worth the experience to swim, outlined by a body clinging glow in the water from millions of micro-organisms that light up upon any slight pressure on their cell walls- we also watched as smimming fish caused glowing lines in the water. Vieques is an hour later than E.S.T., so sunrise is later , as is sunset. There are \"no-seeums\", miniscule bugs that make itchy bites at the beach late in the day as it cools, but the bites go away in a day. The people are friendly, and we felt very safe, even at night, wherever we went. However, you will be warned repeatedly about property theft and not to leave anything valuable in your car, especially at the beaches, and to leave the car unlocked, so that the thieves don't damage the car looking for things to steal. On balance, it is still a great little relatively undeveloped island, no big resort (a W is still threatening to open, but has had repeated delays), and relaxation is its best asset", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york city", "Title": "\u201cService and beauty!!\u201d", "Author": "lazer155", "ReviewID": "UR56980369", "Content": "Everything that could be done to service travelers- packed lunches for beach exploration, beautiful rooms, grounds and pool.

The hotel sits right next door to the Island Adventures Bio luminescent Bay tours building, which was very convenient. The beaches were fantastic! We found them to be secluded, quiet and peaceful.

It depends on what your expectations and tastes are and how picky you tend to be. It is undoubtedly one of the best options on the island. But here are some considerations: - The bed in our room was very firm (Sealy #1 Firm label to be precise). If you like a firm mattress, then the Hacienda has one or more of them. None of the guests we talked to had soft mattresses in their rooms and indicated their beds where firm. So depending on what kind of bed you are used to, you could find the beds here comfortable firm or uncomfortably hard. Note that the pillows in our room were also very firm as well. - If you book a room that is on the same level as the breakfast area, you could hear noise in the morning coming from diners because the area is right outside at least 6 or 7 rooms (with louvered doors and windows). If you like to get up early, this will not matter. If you are a light sleeper and like to sleep in on vacations, you could find this noise an annoyance. If you like more quiet, then ask for a room away from the breakfast area - While the decor of the public areas and rooms has island touches, a fair amount of antiques and objects from Vermont or New England are used to decorate the place. Some people might find this an unusual touch while others might feel it is out of place on a Spanish Virgin Island. - Our room had a couple of chairs, a dresser, and a couple of nightstands and was relatively spacious with a ceiling fan and very good air conditioning. The room's french doors opening to a good view but no balcony to step out on or sit on.There appeared to be a few rooms that had their own outdoor seating areas although they were semi-private - While a bar of soap and liquid soap is provided by the sink in your room, a dispenser of shampoo and soap is mounted in the shower. Generally the water pressure was good and the shower effective at removing sand. We had plenty of hot water. However, on 2 mornings we lost all water pressure and could not get any water in the room. We went downstairs and found that the water hose used to rinse of feet and chairs worked and the restroom off the lobby still had water so we believe it was a problem with the plumbing and not a general water outage. - The breakfasts are good and convenient. You can select from omelettes, scrambled eggs for example with a side like bacon. They also offer a daily special like french toast or pancakes. You also get juice, hash browns (spiced up if you want), and fruit. This is all included in the price of the room. We found this ample and very good compared to other \"inns\" or \"estates\" on other islands that give you a white english muffin, white yogurt, weak coffee.....So if you value a decent convenient breakfast, this place has it. If you want a big buffet, you won't get that here - If you enjoy animals, then you will enjoy the company of the Inn's Old English Sheepdog (shaved to keep cool) and Parrot. At times they hang out in the public areas. If you don't like animals walking around, then you might not appreciate these animals (we liked them both) - The owners did not go out of their way to interact with guests. We did not care about this and not sure whether that is typical of them. But if you like to develop a connection with your innkeepers while staying at inns like this, then you might not find the owners as available as at other inns or \"estates\" where you have stayed. For those who have not liked inns where the owners were omnipresent, then this place might work for you. You can always contact the owners by calling them or using a house phone if you really want to meet them.. - Great location on top of hill right outside Esperanza so close to restaurants and bars. HOWEVER note that if you are going to Vieques, we'd strongly recommend renting a JEEP. If you can't do this, you should be very good at hitchiking (not recommended) or like renting and riding a bike in high temps on bumpy dusty roads. A JEEP is the best way to enjoy your vacation on Vieques and will allow you to visit the beaches and natural areas easily. We are uber-hikers but would not have wanted to hike to the most remote beaches. The Hacienda will reserve a Jeep for you if you want one. The company they used for us was great and the Jeep had newer aggressive tires which were great on the crazy roads leading to the beautiful secluded beaches. - The hacienda has an honor bar. You won't find a bartender to tip or share your troubles with but for those who like to mix their own, the honor bar is great. - The pool is a simple lap pool, abbreviated size, with a few chaises. It overlooks the pasture and Caribbean and has a nice view. - The hacienda does not have a gym, but when we visited, you could go down the hill the an inn next door and use theirs for a fee. We did not visit the gym so we don't know how it is equipped. - You room will have small ice chest and chairs for the beach and beach towels. An icemaker on the ground floor has free ice so that you can ice down your beverages for the beach. Ice is included in the room cost. The machine always had ice available when we were there. - After fellow guests return to their rooms and shut their doors and louvers, the hacienda is pretty quiet at night except for the sounds of tree frogs and other little creatures outside. We had a couple of mosquitos sneak into the rooms but got them before they got us. Bottom Line: Recommended but consider your personal tastes and expectations. Overall, we liked the Hacienda with the caveat that we found the bed and pillows very firm for our taste and had difficult sleeping because we are used to a softer pillowtop beds we sleep in at home and in our other travels. Guests who like firm sleeping surfaces would have probably enjoyed a good sleep. The problem with the water pressure, while a little inconvenient, was not that big a factor because we were going to the beach anyway. What might be \"perfect\" to some guests can be less than perfect to others due to differing tastes. But one thing most people will agree on is that Vieques is a great place for nature and beach lovers.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, ME", "Title": "\u201cJust right for Vieques\u201d", "Author": "BYarmouthMe", "ReviewID": "UR53497002", "Content": "It's difficult to imagine a better place to stay while visiting this laid-back, quirky island.

Jim gave use a contact for one of the publicos but we found the walk down to the beach and then into town was one of the best parts of staying here. We truely unwound as we walked along the beach, We could have used the taxi to go to one of the beaches but found that Sun Bay was just a good and the walk was fun too. The staff always had the room clean and tidy when we arrived back to the hotel and were just great to answer any question. Jim was especially helpful in talking about the island, people, and things to do. After three wonderfull nights, the rooms are great, could not hear another soul, and four glorious days we had to check out to catch our flight. As we sat out on the balcony I plugged my cell phone into charge. As we left, I of course forgot about it until we got to the airport. How stupid! Well Sharon (who should be your choice for taxi driver) was going to beat a world round trip record back to the hotel, we called to see if anyone else was coming. To my great surprise they had someone that was coming to the airport. When my phone arrived it was Jim who went out of his way to get my phone to me. He then refused any payment for this superior client service! Carol and I were both amazed and how well they took care of every detail for us.

The beaches were beautiful but so are many beaches elsewhere. The island is hot, severly underdeveloped and prices swing either way. Either really good dirt cheap from some guy in a truck or expensively overpriced on any of the restaurants on \"main street\" in esperenza. That being said, this hotel is one of the best in the area and that's not really saying much... The price is pretty high. And there are only really 2 saving graces. The breakfast and the pool. These 2 are quite possible the best in the island. The ladies that work the breakfast/clean your rooms are quite awesome. I had the room upstairs (they call it a suite). It was never cold and borderlined on being or actually was uncomfortably hot the whole time. This room (27?) seriously needs 2 airconditioners. The first room and the bathroom remains unbearably hot (went in july) and the bedroom barely manages to stay cool because of the other rooms and because of all the windows letting the sunlight in. It's also impossible to sleep late (which should fully be possible during a vacation) because the sunlight directly hits the bed in the morning blinding the hell out of you. At least the room had a fridge which the smaller rooms do not. This room seriously needs curtains. The hotel had tried to charge us a higher rate then what was booked, but was nice about it after I complained. However, i shouldnt have to complain in the first place. The place has no tv. However, with the amount that they charge, they should at least have one in the library if anything. That or splurge and ensure each room has an air conditioner. There's nothing in the hotel that justifies why they charge such high fees. All the towels are generally worn. They do have provide small coolers, umbrellas and chairs which is a definite plus. There's a honor bar the but the prices are are slightly higher than a nearby grocery store and there's a camera anyway though it's highly unlikely it's constantly monitored. If you stay here you definitely need a vehicle. It's not near any beach so you have to drive whenever going out. Else lounge by the pool. The pool is great, clean and has floaties to play with. If you are set on coming to this island, know what you are getting into. The smaller rooms are better because the air conditioner works effectively.

So we quickly got online and started calling other hotels to see if they had *any* availability to help us on such short notice. Hacienda Tamarindo was on our list of other possible hotels we almost booked, so we gave them a call while flustered with our current situation. Jim, the front office manager at the time we called Tamarindo, was SO kind and helpful. He had one more room, and gave us directions on how to get there and was extremely kind and patient with two exhausted travelers :) Needless to say, we *loved* our room. We booked the Suite that even though didnt have a direct ocean view, did have a beautiful view of their outstanding pool area, and actually did have a view of the ocean from the sitting area of our suite. The suite and the surrounding property and ground were clean and extremely well kept. Breakfast was phenomenal - every morning you had choice of juices, eggs, fruits, hashbrowns, breads, cereal, and a special of the day, along with an assortment of teas (which we really liked). Coffee too of course. (If you like oatmeal in general, order the Puerto Rican version here...YUM!) While we never ordered a premade lunch, they looked great and came in a nice backpack for easy carrying to and from the beautiful Vieques beaches. The owners and front office staff were always extremely helpful with questions about activities and locations of various beaches. They really went out of there way in helping us, which was such a great help with us not being \"in the know\" of where the best beaches are! We absolutely loved swimming in the Bio Bay. It was really amazing how much it glowed. A must see activity. The beaches were beautiful. If you are willing to go off the beaten path, you will almost certainly find a strech of beach all for yourself! The main town of Esperanza had a great selction of foods for lunch and dinner. We ate at Duffys (great drinks and food), Trade Winds (lobster and fish were tasty), and Bananas (Americana bar food) and always enjoyed our meals and drink.

The rooms are spread throughout the first 2 floors of the hacienda, and all have louvered/shutter doors. Our room had a spectacular view of the water - when you opened the double-shuttered doors you could lie in bed and look out at the waves. Unbelievable. We had no AC in our room, just a ceiling fan, but at this time of year it was perfect. There are also strong cross-winds that come through the room so it was not too warm. The Inn makes a wonderful breakfast to order, set out on tables on a veranda. Everything is very open, with pretty views from all over. The staff was extremely helpful in making reservations at restaurants, advising us on which tour to book to the BIoBay (unfortunately, we saw nothing on our trip due to a full moon!), and the Inn lends its guests umbrellas and water-proof holders for money etc when going to the beach during the day.

The property is beautiful with gorgeous views of the Caribbean. Our room was one of the few featured on the website, though the d\u00c3\u00a9cor has been updated considerably, and it was quite comfortable, composed of a king-size bedroom with two very nice armoires, a sitting room with two twin-size daybeds, and a bathroom connecting the two. Only the main bedroom had a/c, but the staff thoughtfully provided a floor fan, which, combined with the ceiling fan, cooled the sitting room sufficiently for sleeping.

The email was a request for 4 packed lunches since we would arrive mid-afternoon and might be too tired to drive someplace to get a late lunch.), we very quickly warmed to the place. We were all charmed by Barkley, the resident Old English Sheepdog, and Shaboo, the brightly colored parrot. Not to mention the staff, including the aforementioned woman, who were all a delight. The pool area was a real oasis, with a shaded pergola and chaises at one end and a vista overlooking the green hills rolling down to the Caribbean at the other. There were two hammocks strung in shaded areas beside the pool, a water fountain incorporated into the pool that muffled voices very effectively, and two small bench-like alcoves set into the deep end of the pool that were perfect for sitting and reading so that one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bottom half was submerged while one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s torso was above the waterline. One thing I really liked about the property was that there seemed to be plenty of private spaces, both sunny and shaded, for tete-a-tetes. Some overlooked the pool, others faced out over the gardens or had views of the Caribbean, but all were nicely situated for privacy. Romantic couples would definitely have no problem finding a space for just themselves. Another thing I really liked were the decorative touches here and there, unexpected little pieces, ranging from an antique wheelchair parked in a corner, to a tiled fountain at the entrance, to a Janus-head hanging up near the breakfast area. The honor bar was also very handy to have around, as we could just make our own drinks and record them in a notebook\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhowever, I would have enjoyed having a blender there to make frozen drinks, and there was no ice cream in the freezer as described on the website.

The menu consists of toast, various kinds of eggs, fruit, a choice of meat, hot or cold cereals, various juices, and a daily special. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m trying to lose a bit of weight, so I opted for fruit and cold cereals until our last day when the special was French toast stuffed with cream cheese and guava\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtell me, dear reader, what would YOU have ordered? I simply had to do it, and it was delicious. I sampled the others' omelets, eggs Benedict, and spicy hash browns and they were all very good. HacTam is just a short walk away from the Inn on the Blue Horizon, which is where we went to eat upon arrival. The email that I had sent requesting lunches on the first day was ignored, so we were grateful to have a place we could grab lunch without having to sort through the rental car process first. We did order the lunches for the next day, which were a disappointment, I'm sorry to say. Three out of the four sandwiches were made incorrectly, and the bread was stale on all of them. Still, we were happy to have them to snack on whilst out exploring the deserted beaches with no facilities--and the fruit and the packaged chips and cookies were all just fine. It's a great concept they have going with the cooler backpack, but based on our one experience with it, it could stand some more attention to detail. All in all, we were extremely pleased with the HacTam. It has a wonderful charm that, if you let it, will ease into your body and mind and embrace you with its serenity. My husband and I will definitely return, and his daughter made a reservation for a stay later this summer before we departed. Despite the small setbacks upon our arrival, I would still rate our experience with 5 stars (or circles, as they use here on TripAdvisor).", "Date": "May 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Silver Spring, MD", "Title": "\u201cHacienda Tamarindo made our trip memorable\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5068407", "Content": "My husband and I wanted to get away for a few days before a conference in San Juan.

The Hacienda is beautiful and well maintained. Our room had a private balcony looking out over the fields to the ocean. The pool is lovely. The breakfast was excellent. One of the best deals on the whole island is the \"box lunch\" offered by the hotel. For $8.50 they pack up a sandwich, fruit, chips and cookie in a backpack cooler. Add some drinks to the cooler in each room and it is easy to spend the day at any beach. The hotel provides beach towels and chairs for guests to take with them for the day. Vieques has beautiful beaches, wild horses, and lots of birds. The Bioluminescent Bay is a once in a lifetime opportunity. There is virtually no shopping and only a couple of dozen restaurants on the whole island. It is a place to go to relax and leave behind the bustle of the city.

I spent some time looking at Tamarindo's website before our trip, wondering how the real thing would compare. I must say, in real life it's even nicer. Being kind of new to the guest house concept, I was surprised at how close some rooms were to the common areas (our room opened to the front lobby), but really the only noise we heard came from the sea. Not too bad, huh? We would happily stay at Tamarindo again. The Crow's Nest looked like another rewarding spot.

This was our first trip to Vieques and based on advice on this forum we chose the Hacienda. We were looking for a quiet place with a pool and a view of the ocean. It was perfect. The Hacienda is a beautiful building and its decorated with lovely antiques and art work. I loved the resident dog, Barkley, cat and bird. (If you don't like animals, I wouldn't go there.) The honor bar was resonably priced and we took advantage of it on more than one occasion. Especially after touring the biobay. You get back around 9pm and there aren't too many places open to eat. They arranged our rental car and everything went smoothly. We did get a pinhole leak in the tire and we noticed it going flat one morning. Burr, the owner, helped us find an air compressor to fill it and we were able to get it back to the rental place (Martineau Car Rental) and they changed it in about 20 minutes. No hassle. The orientation to the island is worth it. You find out a lot of useful info on restaurants and how to get to the secluded beaches. I would avoid Bili restaurant in Esperanza. The service was really bad. Not just Vieques slow, but bad. We had 3 different waiters who didn't seem to know what they were doing and the food made me sick.

After all the great reviews for this place, I booked the top room in the hotel (Carribean Deluxe Suite) even though it was very expensive ($275 per night). I was very dissapointed. Only the living room faces the sea. The large bedroom has a wall of window facing a hedge that blocks a road. While the road is not used much, when a car or truck went by it was as if they were in the room. Even more dissapointing is that there are 2 central air conditioners right outside of the room. When these turned on, it eliminated and possibility of enjoying the room. They are loud and overwhelm the night sounds. We actually has to run our A/C to be able to sleep. Unless these air conditioners are moved, I would recommend people avoid this room. Other rooms also have problems. Many enter through the breakfast area so you are up at 7:30AM. Others have no privacy at all if you open your shutters. Finally, we signed up for the owners introduction which is set up for 10 and found it very boring and excessively long. He rambled on for 2 hours and basically wasted the fist morning of our trip. A simple overview of the island while checking in would be much more appropriate, and people looking for more discussion with the owner can do so. Choices on Vieques are limited, and with the right room this can be a nice place to stay.

Don't miss Burr's orientation...he is a plethera of information: funny, useful, historical and bizarre. Take advantage of the honor bar: sign out some drinks and sit by the beautiful pool overlooking the caribbean when you arrive..wonderful.

First impression of the owner: I had the pleasure of seeing him in action at a local restaurant in town--he called the chef a ------- idiot in front of everyone. (The restaurant ran out of some of its dishes due to the fact that the Blue Macaw's kitchen burned to the ground the night before, thus overcrowding the remaining restaurants in town) The Hacidena's owner proceeded to physically attack the chef in front of a full restaurant. Ruined everyone's evening. At first, I thought he was a disgruntled tourist--but once I found out he was actually a fellow proprieter causing a scene I realized that the postings here were right.

Hacienda owners (Linda and Burr) are the most gracioius hosts and so is the entire stuff. The view from our room was magnificent, room was very cozy and nicely decorated, bed very comfortable. Although there were problems with water supplies on the island, we never experienced any shortage. Hacienda has a look and feel of a friend's home where you feel welcomed and comfortable. There is a full bar where you can fix yourself a drink 24hr/day, there is a library where you can borrow a book or a table game. The breakfast in the morning is wonderful, featuring a special every morning. You have two beach chairs and the cooler in the room that you can take with you to the beach. In addition, you can order lunch the night before that will be prepared for you in the morning, which you can also take to the beach. The pool is beutiful and for you to use 24hr/day. We absolutely loved the pets in Hacienda - Barley (the dog), Shaboo (the parrot) and wonderful kitty (can't remember the name). Shaboo greets everyone on most mornings and sings songs for guest's entertainment. Hacienda is also convinently located a short work from Inn on the Blue Horizon (where you can get dinner or a drink at night) and next door to the place that runs tours to Bioluminscent Bay. There were only 3 negative aspects to our stay in Hacienda. 1) breakfast is only two hours b/w 8-10 and if you missed it, tough luck 2) there is no coffee maker in the room, so if you want tea in the evening, you might not be able to get it, 3) you are not told that you are going to be charged service fee (for room cleaning, various tips, etc).

The views of the Caribbean and countryside are breathtaking. We stayed in a Caribbean Deluxe Room, which was spacious and comfortable. The furnishings included antiques, as well as other tasteful details. Double doors open to a sweeping view of the Caribbean, framed by bougainvillea branches just outside. Breakfast (included in the price) is provided from 8 to 10 am at the outdoor dining area; it was delicious and served by a friendly and efficient staff. Pitchers of coffee, hot milk, and tea water were set out at 6:15am for those early-rising guests who wanted to experience the day at its most serene and dramatic moment--the sunrise. After breakfast, we drove to one of the island's many picturesque beaches to swim, sun, and explore. In the late afternoon, we sat by the Hacienda's lovely pool, relaxing with other guests and taking in the view. Or we would sit on the terrace just off the lobby, feel the tradewinds and again--take in the incredible view! Burr Vail's (Innkeeper) orientation to the Island--a one hour session on the history, ecology, sightseeing and restaurants of Vieques-- was extremely helpful. We also enjoyed meeting other guests of the Inn. In its design and layout, the place really allows guests to choose solitude and privacy--or to interact with others, depending on what you're up for. Shaboo, the Parrot, most likely will greet you enthusiastically whenever you pass by, as well as whistling bars from Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. A few additional notes: (1) There are almost no accommodations directly on the beautiful swimming beaches of Vieques, which is part of the reason they remain as gorgeous and unspoiled as they are. It was nice to be up close and personal with the beach during the day's adventures, and to be able to take in the astounding, more distant panorama of land and sea when back at the Inn; (2) we stayed our last night in a room facing the parking lot, because our first room was not available for our full stay. It was spacious and lovely, and we didn't find it to be noisy at all. However, we did miss having a view; (3) You need a car on Vieques, and there are a limited number available for rent.
