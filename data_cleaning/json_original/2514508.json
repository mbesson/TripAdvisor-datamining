Such a find in London when a lot of the smaller places are awful. The staff were really friendly and helpful. Rooms were quite small but were tastefully decorated and had a flat screen TV. The bathroom was very pleasant and the large overhead rainshower very boutique. The breakfast was plentiful and lots of choice, the lounge area with free tea and coffee very modern. The only very minor downsides for me were: A bit noisy when staying on the fourth floor above the street ( between 7 am and 11 pm). The room was very hot due to the temperature in London during my stay, no air conditioning but a large window (a nice area outside the window to sit if you can get out there). This hotel is in a really nice area, it is quite upmarket and felt safe at night for two females travelling alone. I will definately return here again, its one of the best 3* I have stayed at in London. Compare this to the 5* Russell square, rooms were smaller but service and food much better. This hotel is quite central and its easy to get around with 2 tube stations so close.", "Date": "June 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, UK", "Title": "\u201cReally VERY pleased with my stay\u201d", "Author": "lolly-UK", "ReviewID": "UR7631448", "Content": "We stayed just one night in the Americana, but I was very impressed.

The lounge area is a real bonus for a 3* hotel, and the free tea or coffee a lovely touch. It would seem the bad reviews here are mostly from a couple of years ago.

I stay in there for 3 nights in april 21-24. When I did my check-in I presented a VISA, just for a PRE authorization, since at that time I was not sure about the method of payment (cash, credit card). When I checked-out on april 24 I decide to use another card, an American express, instead of the VISA. All the debts were charged to that AMEX card. Nevertheless, when I checked my cards balance, I verified that THEY BILLED BOTH OF THEM!!!! I had an enormous headache dealing wtih VISA and AMEX trying to cancel the undue debt.
