The property is located just a block from the South Dade Busway Caribbean Rd. stop ($1.50) which runs to/from Tri Rail and Downtown Miami. It is also located directly across the street from the Southland Mall, which features anchor stores like K-Mart, Sears and JC Penny. I found this hotel by naming my price on Priceline*com, where a bid of just $55/night got me in. [The hotel's website was showing $119/nt.]This 4 story building is in a mildly-noisy-at-times area of the city, wedged between a Mc Donald's and a gas station. The hotel offers complimentary parking and continental breakfast each morning. Other amenities include vending  ice machines on each floor, 24 hour front desk, small swimming pool and a small laundrette ($1.25 each for wash/dry).The reasonably-sized rooms offer a comfortable plush bed (an unexpected treat!), 25 cable tv with Showtime and a huge assortment of LodgeNet PPV movies, COMPLIMENTARTY HIGH SPEED INTERNET, recliner chair, ample lamps, iron  ironing board, windows that open and a ceiling fan. Water pressure was fine and the massaging shower head was another perk. Daily service was fine and kudos to the housekeeping team that did not disturb money left on the desk accidentally half-way through my stay. Maintenance of the property was okay - it could use some new paint here and there (guestroom bathrooms) and some general preventative maintenance.Aside from the complimentary breakfast, there is no dining at the property. There's many fast food restaurants in the area - Mc Donalds, Arby's, Burger King, Little Ceasar's (in the K-Mart) and others. There's also an Applebee's and a Tony Roma's within a mile of the hotel. There are pizza and chinese food delivery options - just ask the front desk for menus.In closure, I found this property to meet all expectations and would return if visiting the area again.

Another woman came in and had changed her reservations a few weeks prior from one room to two rooms, but only one room was available.This was a holiday weekend and only one employee was working.

The rooms are decent. Clean and well maintained. The rooms have a newer look but it appears it has been a few years since a remodel. A little wear around the edges but still in very good shape. We had 3 rooms and all were about the same. The breakfast buffet area is fine but the carpets are quite stained. The selections were quite the norm for a budget motel chain. The area nearby is a little rough but we found no problems day or night. They have a security guard at night in the parking area and they lock all of their doors late night including the front entrance so you must have your card key. The hotel is set back off the road and is very quiet. I heard no noise from outside of the hotel ever. McDonalds is adjacent to rhe hotel. There is a K-Mart across the street and a mall with a Macy's, Sears, J.C. Penney, large food court and other stores.I bid thru Priceline and got this for $34 per night so I really can't complain except it is way too far from Miami Beach due to the traffic on U.S. 1.If it were closer to Miami I would stay again.There is an independent Mexican semi-fast food type restaurant on the same block which I would recommend. Being a Los Angeles resident, I know Mexican food and it is pretty bad in Miami but this place is decent (especially for non-Mexicans cooking).", "Date": "May 9, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR977885612", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "CalItalian"}, {"Content": "Bugs! This hotel is very misrepresented in its photos on the Baymont website and on the descriptions of it on travel sites. The rooms are renovated, which means that they have one new secondhand lamp, but the rest of the room is still VERY old and gross. There were bugs crawling out of the wall, which the front desk person said were throughout the hotel due to in-house coffee (what? I didn't find bugs at the other local hotels with coffee!) and could come out of any room at any time.Also, there were cobwebs in the corners, stains on every surface, no pillow-tops matresses (despite the description), very old bathrooms with stained tile, a cheap and dirty plastic shower/surround, and the wall above the shower was falling apart  falling into the shower. The decor was not as it appeared in the photos on the Baymont website; it was very cheap-looking and in guady colors. And, even through it was a second-floor room, there were bars across the window, which didn't make it feel like a safe area.We left immediately and went to a different hotel in the area (that didn't have any bugs).

Spent 2 nights in this embarassment on FEB. 19 and 20 ...... Pros- It is 1 minute off of Florida's turnpike, so it made for a convenient in-between spot between our travels from Orlando to Key West.... complimentary breakfast was bearable, although they ran out of coffee both mornings....everything seemed fresh. They didn't charge for a crib. The suite was good-sized. Although they weren't very helpful, the staff was friendly.  That's it...the only positive things I can sayCons- I requested a non-smoking room a month in adavance. Was told that they had no non-smoking rooms left, but that they would upgrade me to a non-smoking suite at no extra charge. I thought that was great. Checked 2 weeks prior to stay and was told that I had a non-smoking suite. Got to the hotel, asked if I still had a non-smoking suite. The woman behind the desk smiled and said yes...Went to the room and it was a smelly Smoking suite. Wound up being told that was all that they had.This was a real treat for us non-smokers. Cigarette burns on everything...stains on bedspreads.  Neighborhood is a little shady.......Conevenience store next door is the type where Cashier is surround by bulletproof glass... Housekeeping was atrocious. didnt clean the coffee pot or replenish coffe supplies, clean the toothpaste and hair from the sink or change the linens..It looked like she all she time to do was give us fresh towels and pick up the tip that I had left her in advance.  Just a quick story..my wife was going to do some laundry and went down to get change from the front desk.The gentleman said that he had no change. 10 minutes later, I sent my 15 year old niece that was traveling with us for change. The same gentleman had all the change that she needed.....

My husband  I checked in on 02/19/05-02/21/05. What a disappointment!! First we asked for a non-smoking room, well they assigned us a smoking room. This room was just disgusting.

I mentioned to the desk clerk that they put us in the wrong room. She said they had no more rooms left. I insisted on talking to a manager who than gave us a suite. That wasn't much better.

I have never stayed at a Baymont, but decided to give it a try since I was only paying about $65.00 a night, it was close to miami, and I wouldn't be spending any time in the room. As far as cleanliness, it was not up to what I would expect, but truely the only problem was the stained carpet. In the room there was just a spot here and there, but in the continental breakfast area it was oretty bad. Also, there is a noise that occurs every few minutes day and night that you can hear on one side of the hotel. Light sleepers may want to ask for the other side.
