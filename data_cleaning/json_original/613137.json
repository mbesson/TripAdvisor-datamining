He realised the mistake and refunded the 1024 back into my account. Unfortunately that mistake of himself/and the business resulted in a loss of 60USD for me (due to the exchange rate fluctuation, I live in UK).He offered no compensation.I went there as a customer in good faith,to get slammed with a unwillful charge on my card (its not like I bought something and changed my mind). They accepted no responsibility at all, incredibly unprofessional. I wish there was a tribunal I could contact about this. I spent 2 hours speaking to the owner Albert, to no avail. Him just denying and washing his hands of responsibility. A business ethic like that,doesn't deserve business goodwill. Good luck to those who decide to stay there, but I don't wish it upon anyone.

The cons really outweigh the pros. I should have heeded people's warnings on the net. That same old man was really rude to us. He sounded like he was yelling at me at one point. For whatever reason, the second keycard they gave us was not working and when we went down to the front desk to ask about it, the old man gave us an attitude. Very unprofessional! The room was big enough but old and dingy looking. The bed sheets and blankets had cigarette burns and odd stains. The hardwood floor was nice, at least. Oh, and I did not see any bugs. Location is perfect if you plan on going to Burbank (not too far via the highway) or lots of places in east LA area, like Chinatown (you're right in it!), Lil Tokyo, Downtown, Hollywood, etc. However if you want to go to the west LA area or the beaches, you'll be on the road for a while. And another cool thing is we were right near the festivals and events. We heard and saw bike marathon right outside our window one night, and a few mornings later, we could hear drumming from a Chinese festival happening a few blocks away. Parking is challenging and very squishy. There isn't enough parking spaces, so they squeeze you via parallel-style. Price was $70 or something around there. Should have been lower. It is a motel. There is no security. Some creepy man followed my friend and I to our room! Luckily we locked it quickly but he was knocking a minute after we closed the door. Then 2 minutes later, he was knocking again! Luckily he went away. Put simply, we could have been raped.

After the second day, I went and told the management and he sent the house keeping woman to show me how to work the shower...there's only one tap to turn, one way to get hot water so it wasn't an issue of not knowing how to get hot water but I went anyway and tried to explain that although the water doesn't feel cold on your hand, first thing in the morning most people like a hot shower, not luke warm. During our week there, they had the parking lot paved which left only 5 or 6 spots in the lot. When we got back, there was nowhere to park. They had an arrangement already made with a lot across the street to pay our parking there for us, so that was a positive. For me, my biggest concern was the shower.

But I have to say overall this was a pretty decent hotel for the location and price. Royal Pagoda is in the heart of Chinatown and a short 2 block walk to the Metro transit system. The room was clean, and had been remodeled somewhat recently with laminate wood flooring and corian type counter tops in the bathroom. As other reviewers have mentioned, the bathroom is very small, and the counter space is minimal, but the shower is fairly large. It gets the job done. A tight fit for sure though. The Exterior is well maintained with a traditional Chinese design, the room has minimal Chinese decor, basic room. Sure, there are some dings in the room, one wall in the bathroom could use a paint job, overall the room was in pretty decent shape. Parking is tight, but is free...a rairity in the city. Most places will charge an additional $10-$20 per night. We arrived at the hotel at around 1 a.m. and had a space ready for us. The beds were firm and comfy. Standard sheets and comforter...no 400 thred count sheets here which is understandable for the price.. I can understand some people having a problem with street noise as this hotel is on a corner and there is a bus stop on one side of the hotel. Super light sleepers should be aware. The windows are double pane and does block some of the noise. Leaving the fan on from the A/C helps wash out some of the street noise too. The staff was courteous, though when we asked for ice for our small cooler they were a little stingy with that, but we got what we needed. The color TV worked fine, stations availavle in English, Spanish, and Chinese. I didn't count, but there are probably 30-40 different channels to choose from. I have been to L.A. several times, and to find a place in the city for under a hundred dollars a night is tough, unless it's a fleabag or in ghetto area. This is no 5 star hotel nor is it a dump.

Not alot to do in the area, so make sure you have a car. You get what you pay for her - cheap price, cheap accommodation.", "Date": "November 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGood deal for the money and great location\u201d", "Author": "FrugalButPicky", "ReviewID": "UR8600942", "Content": "I'm a business traveler in L.A. 3 nights/wk & had opportunity to stay in a number of different rooms in Royal Pagoda Motel. It's usually a great deal given that the location in Chinatown near downtown L.A. usually costs one much more for similar rooms (prices via Hotels.com, etc., vary, of course). Overall, rooms and bed linens are clean, though I did have one room with a few minor carpet stains and some walls could use a fresh coat of paint, but that's not a concern, and they seem to keep things in good order. Guests seem to be mostly budget-minded Asian tourists and there have been no noisy partying types, at least on the weeknights I've been there. If you're after a clean, quiet, safe place to stay that's about a 20 minute walk or a short bus (DASH) ride from Amtrak - Union Station or downtown L.A., this is your place. For 25 cents, the DASH bus, Line \"B\", runs every 5-10 minutes until about 6:45 PM, loops through Chinatown with a stop right at the corner of the motel, and also loops though downtown L.A. Motel Management has been courtious and attentive, and they seem to run a tight ship. It meets my needs, and I'll continue to use it as-needed. Also, there are plenty of good Chinese restaurants in area, but do try \"Ru Chun\" at 937 N. Hill St., just a couple blocks from Royal Pagoda.", "Date": "September 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "In my skin...lol", "Title": "\u201cCan't Beat It!\u201d", "Author": "msjaycee", "ReviewID": "UR7958084", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed at this motel this past Monday night. We're both military and used to \"roughing it\". And that's exactly what we thought we'd be doing when we booked this motel. It was under $55.00. But we were WRONG! While this place isn't luxury, it's worth more than the 1 star rating that it gets. Our room was very clean and neat. The guy at the front desk didn't speak English very well, but he was still very nice. The room included a refrigerator but no microwave. We went downstairs to see if we could use the one down there. Not only did the guy at the front desk heat our food up for us, but called our room when it was ready. The location is in Chinatown where you can get some really tasty Chinese food. Everyone says the location is dangerous, but we went out at about 2230 to walk to get something to eat and felt totally safe. I'm always aware of my surroundings and never let my guard down though. The other plus was that the freeway was easily accessible. I guess the only negative thing I would have to say was the television didn't work properly. We couldn't change the channel, so we had to watch HBO the entire night . lol. If you're looking for luxury in LA, then this isn't the place for you. But if you need a cheap, clean place to lay your head while you're in LA, this is definitely the place for you. I'll definitely be staying here again!", "Date": "June 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bay Area, California", "Title": "\u201cA Royal Dump\u201d", "Author": "traintraveler303", "ReviewID": "UR6053239", "Content": "The Royal Pagoda Motel was quoted by Hotels.com as being just across the street from the Los Angeles Union Train Station (within walking distance). BEWARE! It is a 10 minute taxi ride into the Chinatown part of LA. The door to the room would barely lock - a big security concern. The room was dingy, light switches had built-up grime. The sheets were old and had visible holes in them. Additionally, the sheets looked as if they had been used and not changed as we found \"suspect hairs\" in the sheets. There was also some questionable activity going on within the motel premises. While in our room, we heard a man pounding on another room door after 11:00PM demanding his $50.00. Lastly, we were told by the Hotels.com booking agent that this motel provided a continental breakfast. I guess if you consider a cup of coffee as breakfast, it applies.
