Some reviewers are not sure if they stayed in the same building as others who wrote pleasant reviews (our stay in the floor above the reception was pleasant). - If you will not stay alone, you may want to confirm that they can give you two sets of keys to enter the room (this was not the case on our recent visit \u2013 one key per room, regardless of the number of guests in it) - If the weather is likely to be very cold during your stay, be aware that the heating system is not on during many hours of the day and night \u2013 ask ahead to learn when it will be on, depending on when you plan to be in the room. - If you want to see TV channels in languages other than Italian, ask if they have added any new channels to the in-room television. - Ask if the renovation work in another building in the same block is completed, as this caused noise one morning starting at 7.15 Am on our recent visit. Once you arrive, since they expect to be paid at the time of check-in, be sure to ask them to show your room before making the payment \u2013 this is your right.

We had noisy neighbours, which isn't ideal, who decided to ignore the no smoking signs, so every night we received an awful smell of cigarette smoke - not the hotel's fault though. Breakfast is poor. It was only breads, jam and croissants. There were a few pieces of fruit, but they didn't look that edible. There are only about 10 tables in the breakfast area, which were definitely not enough to accommodate all the people staying there, so we had to wait a bit to get a table. However the staff working at breakfast are lovely, so they make it a bit more enjoyable. Every evening (well supposed to be every evening, but we realised it was dependent on which staff member was working) they provided a 6-8pm happy hour, with chips, juice and sparkling wine, absolutely free of charge. This worked well, because we used the free WiFi (only available in reception) around that time, after coming back from sight seeing and before going out for dinner, so received some nibbles too.

The location is ideal if using the aiport bus and is close, within walking distance to the colosseum and roman forum. The street the hotel is situated on is fairly quiet. We had booked a twin room and on arriving (at 11pm) were shown to a double room, when i explained to the staff and showed them my reservation I was told that twin meant two people and the bed was adequate. After refusing to pay he agreed that we would sleep in the double room that night and move in the morning as all other rooms were full. I am 5ft 2\" and 57kg - i could barely fit in the shower, i could get in there and stand still but bending down to get the soap meant my skin touched the filthy shower curtain, so if you are any bigger than this then good luck. Also whilst in the shower the light - which is on a timer - switched itself off so i'd to get out and turn it back on again. Breakfast was right outside our room - literally we could open the door and touch a breakfast chair - so we were up bring and early the next morning to move rooms. On returning - our things had been moved to the new room, this room was much bigger and brighter and the bathroom had improved ten fold, as had the member of staff on the reception desk - so I guess it depends what room you are in in the hotel and if the staff can be bothered doing their job. The lift is gorgeous - its original and very beautiful - however we were only on the first floor so no need to use it. this is the only good thing about the stairwell though - otherwise there is lose wiring in junction boxes that are open, the stairwell is dirty and at the main entrance there are garbage bins that stink.

I did not stay for the breakfast but it looked like it would be nice:it is few floors below the rooms. The TV in the room is small, cannot say what channel they provide, no time to watch it.

The ethernal city was also the heart of an empire once.. so you are entering history, when you enter in Rome, like it or not.. and is for your own safety.

We had initially booked over the internet to stay at another hotel they own (Hotel Picasso) but on arrival were told that they were having some plumbing problems, so they put us up in the Caravaggio instead, which has a higher rating but they only charged us our original price (about 70 euro/night, which we thought was very good for Rome). So the staff are very honest, and for the few days we were there they were alwasy helpful. The hotel is on the first floor of a residential building, so it is secure, with buzz-in entry, and up a flight of stairs (there is a lift too). Positives: * Good location- cheaper places in Rome tend to be further away (near the Vatican), so for what we paid the location was excellent. It is about a 10 minute walk to the Colosseum, 10 minutes to the main train station (Termini), 10-15 minutes to Trevi fountain. We walked everywhere and never used the metro, though I think there is a metro station nearby. The furthest walk is to the Vatican City, which takes about 45-60 minutes. It's also sort of out of the touristy area, so it's not too busy (though this was in winter), and you don't get bothered by umbrella/bag/flower sellers. It's also a nice escape from hordes of tourists. *A variety of restaurants nearby with good food at good prices, so there's a range of good places to eat without having to walk too far *Very helpful staff, who directed us to the nearest internet, laundromat, and post office. They also talked us out a tour that we were going to go on that they had heard bad things about. They are very trustworthy. *Our room was quite large, with a little balcony, and lots of space. This was especially good as we were there for a few days. *The bathroom is not huge, but is big enough, and the shower is quite good, though not the best I had on the trip, though there is a good hairdryer. *Reading other reviews, I think renovations must have been done- the floors were all new, marble, with good bedding, and the bathroom fittings were very new. Our room was actually very nice to look at and to stay in. *Breakfast is nothing fancy- a variety of breads, with conserves, juices, and a choice of coffees. It's more than enough to start off the day with. Not so good: *Some of the furniture was a bit rickety- not too bad, and we never had any problems, but rickety nonetheless. This was a great hotel to stay in given the price, the proximity to so many sights, the choice of restaurants nearby and the spacious room. I would probably stay here again- not at full price, but I think if you are paying a but less it is worth the price. The staff were very honest and helpful, and that was important to us.

The bathroom was small but clean and functional, and the shower was fine. There was enough water for two persons to take a shower 3 times a day, anyway. I personally didn't mind the small rooms and corridors, but we weren't there that much. We didn't have breakfast there (I agree that was terrible), but there was an nice bakery around the corner with cheap rolls. I also thought the staircase was very nice looking, and it didn't bother me at all. There was a very slow and somewhat stupid person behind the 'reception' (a desk with some papers on it) who wanted to charge us for using the airconditioning and breakfast. When we explained we didn't use it, we didn't have to pay for it. We payed cash, by the way, so no extra charging for rooms afterwards. We payed 35 euro per night.", "Date": "May 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Lauderdale", "Title": "\u201cBroken furniture, freezing cold, the WORST I have ever stayed in.\u201d", "Author": "Ernest", "ReviewID": "UR2516899", "Content": "In Rome for New Years, this was the only reserv I could get.

We have traveled extensively but this hotel surpasses the \"Terrible\" rating shown. Service is non-existent. Cleanliness is a joke. AC does not work. Linens have holes in them. Closets/armoire with its broken wire hangers is a broken cupboard that was probably picked up from a garbage dump. The elevator is a terror with open wire cage and electrical wires exposed. The hallways are unmarked and a definite fire trap. Plumbing malfuntioned much of the time. Hot water was occasional. The shower sprayed water everywhere including on the electrical outlet and light. Holes in the floor. AC did not work so window facing the street was opened which let in the noise from the nightclub across the street. Bugs from open window. Breakfast was served in a dirty, dismal room with disgusting food and undrinkable coffee. Chipped dishes. Juice served in a broken plastic pitcher. Avoid this food. Don't stay in this hotel. If your travel agent tries to book you, refuse. Nothing about this hotel is worth more than $10 US per night, if that! Pre-purchased through RailTour for $200 per night. Complained to RailTour and did not get a response. Hopefully RailTour will remove this hotel from their list.", "Date": "July 14, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cBIG DUMP\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1553426", "Content": "My husband and I had a gut feeling to tell the taxi driver to keep going and find ourselves another hotel. Its on the 1st floor of this building with a nasty entry. We got there and the guy tells us that the credit card machine is broken and that we would have to pay cash. He insisted but when my husband and I said we were going to leave, he said that maybe the machine would work again. The bedcover was filthy with cigarette holes all over it. The blanket was completely stained with I don't know what! The breakfast room was tiny and they couldn't even make us a cappucino because they wouldn't get the machine fixed. Very cheap.
