{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not Recommended for Non-Chinese Speakers or During Cold Weather! This hotel might be ok for a summertime visit, but I arrived in November and it was completely inadequately heated. There was a heating unit attached to the ceiling but it didn't provide nearly enough heat - it was freezing. I ended up leaving and cancelling my stay because I couldn't stand the cold. Also, you can only make local calls from the phone in the room - you can't even use a phone card. I tried to use an IP card to make an international call and it doesn't work - you can only use phone cards at the front desk. Very inconvenient.If you don't speak Chinese I don't recommend staying here - I spoke Chinese so it wasn't a problem, but the staff hardly spoke English at all. Also, be prepared to walk - taxi cab drivers don't know where the place is, so if you don't speak Chinese you'll have a hard time explaining to them how to get there. The staff was very friendly, but it was just too cold there to be enjoyable.", "Date": "Nov 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR103512363", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "LBC2008"}, {"Content": "The best - loved the Spring Garden in Beijing       ceiling in our room", "Date": "Jul 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR167003421", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Vidaliatravels"}, {"Content": "The Spring Garden Hotel - A taste of life in the Hutongs We just left the spring garden hotel last week and had a wonderful experience there. This hotel is situated right in the middle of a hutong (for those who don't know, a hutong is basically an old world courtyard style house, one level  usually with a garden in the middle). If you're looking for a highrise luxury hotel then this is NOT the place to go...the Sheraton is a few kilometers away. The room was very comfortable...i think we stayed in room 7. The total number of rooms there were under 10. The decor of the room is typical classic chinese style with a 4 post canopy bed and wooden furniture. The staff at the hotel are great. Unfortunately I never got their names but they were always more than willing to help us with absolutely anything we needed. When we wanted to go out for dinner and drinks, we showed them places we wanted to go to (or often they would suggest places themselves) and they would write it down on a little slip of paper in chinese for the cab drivers to understand. FYI - if you're going to beijing for the first time, communicating with cab drivers can be quite difficult. Breakfast comes with your room rate and is delicious and made to order. Keep in mind that you have to order the night before and they will have it ready for you whenever you wish. There is a Chinese breakfast (dumplings, pork buns, wantons, etc) and a Western breakfast (eggs, toast, coffee  juice). Overall a wonderful experience and really nothing to complain about. Quick tip - there is a minimart at the end of the hutong on the main road. You can get anything there from little snacks to beers for very cheap. If you have any questions or need any info at all about my experience in Beijing feel free to contact me.", "Date": "Jun 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR482152837", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "omar1080"}, {"Content": "A Taste of Old Beijing       The entrance to the hotel", "Date": "Mar 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR911559052", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "SheridanC"}, {"Content": "Lovely, quirky, friendly and helpful       Our room, with the really cool bed.", "Date": "Mar 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR390853601", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jwcane"}, {"Content": "Spring Garden - a tranquil jewel       Patio sundowners", "Date": "Sep 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR901024368", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "FerryTyles"}, {"Content": "A small quiet hotel in the heart of Beijing We stayed at the Spring Garden Hotel for 5 nights in April 2007 and had a wonderful time. It is a traditional Si He Yuan with 8 rooms located in a hutong. Since it is outside of the standard tourist district, we felt like we got to experience real life in Beijing. The photos on the hotel's website provide a fair representation of the hotel. The staff is wonderful and speaks adequate English. They were extremely helpful with making sight-seeing arrangements. They also hailed a taxi for us when we left for the airport. They even made sure that we had extra bottles of water to take with us on our day trip to the Great Wall. The rooms are located on a single level around 2 separate courtyards and were clean and nicely furnished with antique reproductions. They are also extraordinarily quiet. The beds contain traditional Chinese mattresses and might be considered hard by some. The bathrooms were new and modern and came with the standard amenities (toothbrush, comb, etc.). During our stay, one of the showers began to leak and it was fixed immediately upon request. There were televisions and air-conditioners in each room. Breakfast was included in the price of our room and was served either downstairs in a breakfast area or in the courtyard. They were also willing to pack a picnic breakfast if needed. The choice for breakfast was either American or Chinese and included as much as you wanted. Dumplings were served in the early evening upon request. Bottled water was included with the room, but other drinks were available for a small fee. A karioke machine was also available for use by guests in the downstairs breakfast area. The location is very central, near many shops and restaurants. A Bank of China with a cash machine is located within a 1/2 block from the hotel (on Xi Shi Street). It is an easy walk to BeiHai Park with its market, restaurants and natural beauty. The # 22 bus runs down Xi Shi Street, through the Xi Dan shopping area and then to Tiananmen Square. Another bus stops about a block away goes to the zoo/aquarium. It is also about a 15 minute walk to the subway (or an easy transfer from the bus to the subway at Xi Dan). Taxis are also easily hailed on Xi Shi street. The 7 year old who was traveling with us wants you to know that the Spring Garden was the best hotel that she stayed at during her entire 2 week trip to China. The adults on the trip concur.", "Date": "May 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR430002620", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "all4travelling"}, {"Content": "\u9288\ue76c\u510d\u9289\u581b\u5127\u9289\u7b3a\u512c\u9287\ue044\ue196   showReview(23266253, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 4, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR502678066", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "chiaki1026"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d634446-r21943621-Spring_Garden_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "634446", "Price": "$90"}}
