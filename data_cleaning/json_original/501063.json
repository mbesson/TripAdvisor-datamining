The staff were charming and helpful . We e-mailed the Sunday before our Thursday arrival, asking if we could store our luggage securely as we were likely to be arriving early. We received an E-mail back ten minutes later saying that this would not be a problem. As it happened the room was ready when we arrived. The room itself was clean and recently updated with wooden floors and good quality furniture. The shower and toilet were modern and spotless.The safe in the room was also a plus as was the free use of the computer. We thought the Breakfast was good value for Paris, being buffet style with good quality mini breakfast pastries plus cereals, eggs, bread, jam,cheese orange juice etc. In terms of the location, the hotel is in a very pleasant, but well served residential area. There are numerous bakeries, restaurants, a Printemps department store and the fabulous Cours de Vincennes market on the doorstep. The lively Bastille area is probably a ten to fifteen minute walk and the rest of Paris is easily accessible using the nearby Metro and RER stations. Granted you can't leave a left bank club in the the early hours and stroll to the hotel but otherwise the Hotel is well situated. The advantage of having of the Metro line so close also results in what might be the the only niggle with the hotel, in that you can sometimes hear the low rumble of the trains during the day. However as the trains stop at night and the noise was barely audible, we did not find this a problem at all. We would recommend this hotel without hesitation. If you book in advance over the internet' the Printemps costs less than many of the budget chain hotels and it is so much better!", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "MA", "Title": "\u201cLovely little Paris hotel\u201d", "Author": "alissa2128", "ReviewID": "UR125252578", "Content": "We stayed here on our European trip in July '11 for four nights. We booked it based on the reviews we read on here, and we were so glad that we did. We had a fantastic stay. While it is not located in the heart of the city, it is very convenient to two different metro locations- Picpus right across the street, and Nation about 5-7 minutes away. Upon check-in, the staff was very friendly and accomodating. We arrived early, and they were just finishing cleaning our room. They allowed us to check in and put our things in the room as soon as it was cleaned. The room itself was great- very modern and updated, and very clean (as is the rest of the hotel.) I personally really liked the fact that the rooms have wood floors (or faux wood) and not carpet, makes it feel much cleaner! The rooms are small, but standard for Europe. We did eat breakfast here a few of the days. It seemed on the priceier side, but they did have fresh eggs. They also had cereal, and of course pastries. We enjoyed the breakfast and the fact that it was convenient, but you may get more for your money just going to one of the little pastry shops around the area--which we did a couple of times as well. There is a grocery store in the area, and one night we decided to grab some cheese and wine and enjoy it at the hotel. Staff was very helpful and got us two wine glasses and a corkscrew, and we enjoyed it out on the little patio in the center of the hotel. I highly recommend this hotel. If you are looking to be close to the action of Paris, this is not the place for you. But if you are looking for something that feels like a 4-star hotel for a 2-star price, and are willing to hop on the Metro to get to where you want to go, then this is definitely the place for you.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cIdeal launchpad for exploring Paris\u201d", "Author": "1stClassLounge", "ReviewID": "UR124800777", "Content": "If you're looking for an affordable and conveniently located place to stay in Paris, this is it.

I am a veteran of the European hotel breakfast, and Hotel du Printemps' breakfast is one of the more basic I've seen. Save your 8 Euros and walk to a boulangerie.

Very modern in it's presentation and very comfortable. Only stayed for one night but we thoroughly enjoyed the Hotel du Printemps. It's located close to Picpus metro station (2 minutes walk), but Nation is also nearby. There are a number of shops in the hotel's vicinity (patisseries, a supermarket, fromagerie) and several small bars and restaurants. We arrived before the usual check-in time at the hotel, but that didn't matter. We were received very well by the friendly and very professional young gentleman on reception. A great start. Despite our early arrival, our room was ready so we went straight up. We were very impressed. The room was small (typical of Paris hotels) and more long than wide. The high ceilings made the room feel bigger than it was. Decor-wise it was smart with neutral, earthy colours. There was a flat-screen TV and the room was exceptionally clean. The same could be said for the en-suite. Wi-fi was available and there was a PC in reception that we could use free-of-charge. After settling in we headed out to explore the nearby surroundings. A good idea as we found a cracking food market along the Cours de Vincennes selling fruit, vegetables, fish and hot and cold food amongst other things. The following day there was an antiques/flea market. This experience confirmed that we had chosen a good area to stay in, despite it being a little further away from the main sights of the city. That said, the transport system whisked us into the centre in 10 minutes (TIP: buy a Paris Visite travel card - more expensive than other European city travel cards, but still good value). I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It's small but very well formed with great staff and a really homely feel to it.

I booked the hotel online with a non-refundable condition, after 2 weeks, I realized I made a mistake and call them. They re-arrange my booking without penalty and accomodate me accordingly, and I truly appreicate that. I booked the superior double and triple. Rooms are very comfortable, big in Europe standard, spotlessly clean, and all furnitures are decorated nicely. The hotel is near Picpus metro (5 mns) more than Nation (10 mns), however, Nation is a hub of diff metro and train lines which will bring you to most part of town. There are restaurants near both metro, Dalou is our favorite near Nation, try their bavette and duck, really good. Casino supermkt is just outside Nation metro (exit Ave du Trone). A block from the hotel near Picpus metro, you will find small shops, pastry , cheese, wine... very residential feel and charming. Breakfast is 8 Euro which has poached eggs, ham, croissant... a good start for the day. Option is grab a croissant (1 euro) in the pastry shop next door, who can resist french criossant. Taxi from airport (CDG) to the hotel is between 50 - 70 Euro, and 25 Euro from Orly. You can negotiate with the driver to have a fix price rather than using the meter on rush hour, traffic can be very bad so it adds up with meter, it is around 20 - 30 mns drive without traffic, but can be approx 1 hr min during rush hour. If you plan to take the train and metro, it will cost approx 10Euro per person to the hotel from CDG, suggest you to think twice, because you need to transfer, stairs, small corridors, and long walk.

First, let's get the basics out of the way. This is Paris: the rooms are SMALL. The bathroom is SMALL. I think we can just apply that to 90% of the hotels, unless you're dropping mega bucks, which we definitely were trying to avoid. That said, the rooms and hotel were impeccably clean. This is a family-owned hotel and the couple that run it are lovely people. Also, Mark and Claudia, who take turns running the reception desk, are very helpful with all requests and can get you anywhere you need to go. The location of the Hotel is great: 2 blocks from the NATION Metro stop, which means you can be anywhere in Paris in 15 minutes using the RER/Metro system. Highly recommended: buy a 5-day pass for 50 Euros. If I could give only one piece of advice for first timers in Paris this would be it. Taxis can be very expensive, and the metro system is very easy to use once you get the hang of it. Back to the hotel: it is situated in the Picpus neighborhood (I know, not a very appealing name), which is a very, very upscale area. Clean and quiet. The girls were delighted to find themselves surrounded by wine & cheese shops, bakeries, flower shops, etc. A very authentic French neighborhood, not \"touristy\" at all, but again, only two blocks from Nation and therefore 15 minutes from virtually all the most popular tourist destinations. Finally, the rooms are not very noise proof. We had a \"gentlemen\" next to us roll in the last two nights around 4 AM, and you could literally hear him walk across his room, take a shower, bump into furniture, etc. I would recommend asking specifically for Room # 3, due to it's location you only have one neighbor and therefore might be able to minimize the chances of having a bad one.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cClean and Classy\u201d", "Author": "PedMeg", "ReviewID": "UR99751161", "Content": "Lovely clean, modern and freshly decorated hotel.

What we liked about Printemps: Location -- easy access to Metro Nation stop, you could be at the Louvre in about 15 minutes without having to change trains. We liked being off the tourist track and in an area frequented more by locals. There were many decent cafes right near the hotel where you could get a typcial French meal at a half-way decent price. Loved the Casino grocery store. We stopped there almost everyday for water, snacks, etc. One Saturday, there is a typical Parisian market near the hotel with an amazing assortment of fruits, cheeses, meats, etc. You see all the old ladies and the families shopping for their grocers. Value -- I did feel like this was a decent value for the money, given that we were in Paris. The hotel is in a safe location, it's easy and fast to get to the tourist attractions, the hotel was clean and safe. We did get a larger room, but i was still small. The bed was shoved against a vey cold window and I had to pile blankets on my side of the bed to stay warm. However, it's Europe and you have to accept these things if you are staying at a non-American chain hotel. We were thrilled that the hotel offered free Wi-Fi, and also had a desktop computer with printer in the lobby that guests could ues free of charge. We were in Paris as the strike over the change to France's retirement age was getting hot. We were quite worried about being able to get to the airport for our flight home, as the roads were predicted to be clogged (they were) and it was uncertain whether trains would be running as scheduled and if gas would be available for the planes. The man who was at the front desk that night was very helpful in finding us a cab -- he called several companies and got us a cab to pick us up at 4:30 am. We beat the traffic jams and got to the airport -- there were people on our flight, including crew, who were not so lucky -- thanks to his help. The breafast they serve is not worth it,s o skip it and save your money. There are many bakeries and cafes in the area where you can get pastry and coffee.

Upon arrival there were no problems and everything was very smooth, despite our late arrival. I particularly enjoy the fact that the hotel will hold the keys to the room each time you leave the hotel so that you do not need to carry them around as you enjoy Paris. There is someone at the front desk 24/7 that will give you your keys and attend to any questions etc. The location while I guess considered to be a short ride to all the main attractions, is just that. A 10 minute ride on the metro and you are in the epi-center of all that is Paris. The metro is literally only a 5 minute walk. SOME walking is just part of the EUROPEAN experience, we are Americans and we recognize that we don't need to jump into our car as soon as we walk outside the door. Take the metro, walk a little - it's part of the experience and it is very enjoyable! The short duration of both will give you the pleasant experience without the annoying factor of \"ugh - too much walking/too much metro\". Around the hotel there are several cafe's and restaurants all within a 5 minute walk, some even shorter! They are all very nice and from what we saw generally open pretty late (1130pm and even later in many cases). There is also a grocery store near the Nation metro, about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. It is called CASINO.... go there to pick up little snacks to enjoy your downtime in the hotel. There is also a great pastry shop right next door to the grocery store... PNB Paribas charges no fees for those customers that are Bank of America customers... a \"bankomat\"... ATM, is located near the Nation metro station. Ask kindly and im sure someone can point you in the right direction, or just check google maps. Again, a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The size of the room is like any other room in Paris, relatively small. This is not going to be a room the size of what any are used to with a Marriot and such, but the size of the room does not at all take away from the quality. The room is very well decorated and offers many nice features such as a LCD tv, and nicely finished bathroom. There is a public computer and printer in the lobby for those that dont bring their own laptop, or free wifi in your room if you have your own device. Our ONLY two complaints are as follow, and honestly, they are minor: 1) The wife would have liked a full lenght mirror somewhere in the room... perhaps on the wall where there is some space as you walk in. 2) At times the maids were a bit loud outside and you could hear doors opening and closing, moving around, etc, so it made it a bit difficult to sleep AT TIMES and we would periodically wake up. The sound isolation of the rooms is not the best, but it is OKAY. There was also what sounded like a metro going by every 5 minutes at times for a period for a few seconds, but i dont believe there is a metro under the hotel so I am uncertain what this random noise was. It was not present at all times. Aside from these 2 minor things, everything else was wonderful.

Unfortunatly, we are talking about Paris, so the hotels can be very expensive and very, very old! I'm alergic, so I can\u00b4t stand old carpets and mold curtains... I highly recommend Hotel du Printemps if you want reasonable price, clean room with no carpets and don\u00b4t mind spending time in the subway! PROS - Rooms were recently renovated. Everything new: wooden floor, decoration, bathroom, curtains, etc. - Confortable beds, air conditioning, shower with very hot water, hair drier, TV (with CNN, RAI, BBC, spanish channel), towels always dry. - Nice residencial neighborhood, quiet, with good restaurants, bars, markets, and street markets on weekends! Loved it! Althought we stayed in a room facing the street, we didn\u00b4t hear noise because of the double glassed window and because we stayed in a higher floor (4th). - Metro Nation is 5min walking from the hotel and has the red RER and other subway lines. CONS - We got the superior room, so it was a little bit more spacious, but don\u00b4t expect a big room. Also, in the inferior room I believe the bathroom is inside the room, with no doors separating (you probably should check it). - A big person can complain about the space in the shower, but for us it was fine. - The hotel is still under renovation (june 2010), so the lobby and some floors have paint drops, painters, etc, but we didn\u00b4t hear any noise in the night. - Also, the hotel is NOT central, so expect to spend at least 30min to get to a central turistic attraction (including walking, taking the subway, etc). You WILL get the subway everyday going out in the morning and coming back in the night. I didn\u00b4t mind because I was with my husband, the neighborhood looked safe, the sunset in may is only 10pm, and our touristic routine is leaving in the morning and only come back after dinner.

After a few weeks of scratching our heads, my partner and I finally located this darling little place. I'm always nervous of hotels in Paris as you often pay through the nose for very little, or worse yet: something dingy and dirty. It could be the location (the hotel is between Nation and Picpus on the metro) as it is a bit far out, but I was completely delighted by the value to standard ratio. The location, let's start there! Nation is on line 1, which is great, but as it is so far removed it isn't one quick stop on the metro to the Louvre or Champs Elysees, it's a few. The metro, however, is notoriously awesome in Paris and will get you anywhere quicklike. It's far, though, so prepare for fifteen minutes to city centre. It's directly on RER A, though, which is the direct train to Disney. Around the hotel are a good few bars and restaurants, but right now (March 2010), there is a lot of construction, which sort of mars the skyline. The hotel itself was under renovation, but to me that wasn't a problem. We stayed in the newly renovated room 20 and even though we were directly above a room being painted and fixed we were never woken up by work sounds, nor did we ever smell paint or other finishing. The workers when we walked down the stairs in the morning always said bonjour and waved, as well! The staff were warm and courteous. They took obvious delight in my poor French and my boyfriend's funny French accent, but they were helpful and really nice. The room was perfect for 82EUR. It was long and thin (interesting), but we had a perfect double bed, a small closet, a little desk, and telly. Honestly, we weren't in our room much, so it didn't matter, but if you're a \"I need lots of space sort\" you wouldn't like it. Just enough room on the side of the bed to the wall. Our window overlooked SARL Concorde, which was gorgeous. The bathroom was clean and modern with a super shower. Honestly, comfortable bed and clean? I'm sold.

The staff was real good about adding the third bed (same size), so we were glad we could find a place for 3 travelers. The room automatically became smaller than it already was :-) BUT we didn't book this particular room for space. We booked it because we wanted a safe, clean place to stay during our Paris vacation. This hotel was great for this! We pretty much used it to sleep/shower. One note: the elevator can only carry 3-4 people tops. Only 2 with a piece of luggage each. It's tiny (-: no big whoop...just take turns. A BIG plus of this hotel was that it was less than a block away from a Metro station. Even though the hotel itself was far from most of the attractions, it was VERY ACCESSIBLE to everything through the metro. You pretty much have to use the metro anyway to get around, so this was not a big deal at all. BIG PLUS for this. This station was called Picpus, and it was in Line 6, I believe. From here, you can get just about anywhere within minutes (you may need to jump on another subway). Either way, if you're visiting Paris you should buy a 7-day pass or so to get around everywhere efficiently :-) One minus of this hotel was that I couldn't find enough outlets to plug in my 3 cameras (video, still, SLR) + cell phone. An extension cord would've been nice, but I didn't bother asking for one. The staff was pretty good. We only needed to talk to them to pay (the price was exactly as advertised) and for directions once. We didn't eat breakfast there, since we wanted to explore and eat outside of the hotel. Overall it was a good value.

I booked this hotel because of the price and its location close to Nation RER and Metro station. First things first, this is not a luxury hotel. The rooms are very small and pretty basic. We stayed in a double room with an en-suite bathroom. You get a bed, two tiny bedside tables, bedside lamps, a small desk, small wardrobe and TV. The en-suite was very compact, almost cubicle sized, but had a toilet, wash basin, mirror and a pretty good shower with plenty of hot water. But for the money, and especially in Paris, you get more than what you pay for. The front desk staff were a mixed bag. All spoke pretty good English and one girl was very nice. However one man was extremely rude. My girlfriend is fluent in French but he refused to speak to her in French, instead speaking in broken English. He seemed uninterested in working there and certainly wouldn't go out of his way to help. However I wouldn't use this as a reason to avoid the hotel. The lobby of the hotel is small but nice. The breakfast area is right in the lobby due to all the buildings being compact in Paris. We did not pay for breakfast any morning, instead choosing to get breakfast at some nearby shops or restaurants. Which brings me onto the location. The hotel is a 5 min walk from Nation metro station. Nation is a large roundabout with over 8 exits so finding which one to take is not easy. The street that the hotel is on is not actually one of the exits. The easiest way to find it is to look for the \"Quik\" fast-food restaurant. Walk past that and there will be a road veering to your right. That's Boulevard de Picpus and the hotel is a short way down that street. There is an excellent patisserie right on the corner between the Metro station and the hotel which has excellent pastries. There is also a \"Casino\" supermarket, some restaurants and a \"Printemps\" nearby. Because Nation is a little outside the center of Paris it really feels like you're in \"real\" Paris with very few tourists. However the Metro and RER station can take you anywhere you need to go in a short time. Getting to Central Paris is no problem. We also went to Disneyland Paris and the RER train goes straight to it from the Nation RER station. Lastly a nice touch in the hotel is a PC with free access to the Internet. This came in very handy when searching for some good restaurants. One I highly recommend is \"Brasserie Bofinger\" just a short walk from Bastille metro station. www.bofingerparis.com/ In summary for the money you pay this hotel is good value.
