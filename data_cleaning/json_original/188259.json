I had booked 1 Queen but upon checking in, I was given a room with a King. Well, what I thought was a King bed until further investigation. It was actually two Twins pushed together. It wasn't a major concern as I was traveling alone but weird that there was no foamie or padding of any kind to disguise that it was two beds pushed together. Just something to watch out for. The room itself was small, but clean minus a clump of hair in the heating unit and some cobwebs in the corner. I only went down for breakfast once and would advice going earlier than I did (at 9am) because they seemed to be running out of the offered items. There was juice, toast, bagels, cereal and fruit.

Our room was good, although a little oddly shaped. The TV was in a chiffarobe in an alcove of the room. The room was generally very clean - except for the rug. The rug was a trifle grimy, and in this case, buckled so that we had to be careful not to trip over it. Our window faced the main street and let huge amounts of sun pour in. It was easy to be blinded and overheated here unless you were very diligent and inventive about closing the curtains. The view was great though. We could look out and watch the picturesque proceedings at an eccentric hair salon in an old building across the street. The included continental breakfast was offered in a small basement room that was usually crowded to overflowing. A small, harmless fire involving the toaster there necessitated our having to evacuate the building one Sunday morning. I usually preferred to eat at the \"Smile\" Cafe across the street. Also, the staff was very friendly - however they failed to issue us our wake-up call one morning. No harm done. Our alarm clock came through. These small negatives aside - the overall value of the place was great. The Hotel is on a bus route that will take you directly to Stanly Park. The harbor and other parts of downtown are all within walking distance. There's free access to a computer in an alcove in the lobby, so if you don't have a Wi-Fi- ready computer with you, you can still check the Internet at almost any time.

This one is in West Pender Street. In some 3 months of travelling across the US and Canada, this has been our favourite hotel so far. We liked it so much we stayed almost three weeks \u2013 broken by a driving trip to Banff and return. Overall: Really comfortable stay in a nicely decorated room complete with refrigerator and microwave. Great value and reasonably quiet. Best room tip: Rooms ending in x07 above the third floor are in the very corner of the hotel, and you\u2019ll get two windows (that can open). We stayed in 607 and had no noisy footsteps above us, with a view of the snow dusted nearby mountains and the harbour. This was the first hotel in several months we didn't need earplugs to sleep. Minor annoyances: We returned from Banff around 11:30pm and had to park the vehicle ourselves, but were still charged the full overnight rate for valet parking ($25 per night). Valet parking finishes at 11pm. Free internet was reasonable but patchy (can\u2019t make skype calls), but will do the job if you need it for the occasional email check. We also stayed in room #403 for a couple of days, which was a much smaller room for the same price (one chair, no refridgerator, no microwave, and the only window opens onto an alley and building). Ramada had a \u2018stay 3 nights and get 20% off\u2019 deal, so we got two queen sized beds and breakfast for around $78 per night booked direct on their website. Breakfast was a great selection and included a hot dish of egg (patty) and small breakfast sausage, pancakes sometimes, hot waffles and the usual assortment of cereal, bagels, toast, juice, tea/coffee and muffins. Is served in the basement and there\u2019s usually enough seating for everyone. Breakfast runs until 9:30am and later on weekends. Our 607 room also had two chairs and a desk. Bedding and pillows were comfy. An adjustable heater/air-con in the room worked well (and quietly). Large selection of cable channels on the flat screen. Washing machines and driers are available in the basement for a small fee. A free daily local newspaper was provided each day. Drink/snack machine & ice machine also available on a couple of floors. This hotel is in walking distance to lots of things. It\u2019s a two block uphill walk (small incline) from the light rail station (Skytrain) \u2013 catchable from Vancouver Airport into the waterfront terminal for around $7.50 per person. Close by is the fashion shopping precint in Robson Street (around 4 blocks); Gastown restaurants & souvenirs (look for the steam powered clock); the Vancouver lookout tower (go back up in the evening on your earlier ticket, for gorgeous sunset views); Vancouver Public Library (free, strong internet for 2 hours); Vancouver Art Gallery; the Vancouver Convention Centre (six blocks), a couple of 24/7 convenience stores (good for a cheap heat-up-in-the-microwave-in-your-room meal); a large post office; a couple of sports bars serving good meals; Rogers Arena (8 blocks \u2013 catch a game of ice hockey) and BC Place Stadium (catch a game of gridiron \u2013 7 blocks). There are also several coffee shops (Starbucks, Waves, Tim Hortons) within two blocks. Thrifty and Budget car rentals also nearby. The hotel is next door to a (homeless?) lodge and you\u2019ll get plenty of requests for money and/or cigarettes if you\u2019re waiting outside the front of the hotel, but people mostly seem harmless. We also found Gastown particularly bad for requests for money. Also next door is a sports bar that offers 10% discount for hotel guests. Innovative menu but can be a bit noisy and 'blokey', and rooms facing onto West Pender street are likely to get a bit of street noise on the weekend from sports bar patrons. Staff here were amongst the most genuine and helpful we\u2019ve encountered in three months of travel across Canada.

The bed was super comfy w/4 fluffy pillows & the bathroom has a shower-over-tub w/nice toiletries & a curved curtain rod so no icky curtain sticking to you as you shower/bathe! Also, the water was quick to heat, there were several nozzle settings & the water pressure was very good + consistent. The in-room wifi was strong & didn't drop at all. The location is 2.5 blocks from Waterfront station, the terminus station of the Canada Line Skytrain direct from YVR airport, which makes arriving here very convenient. Also, several bus lines run right in front of the hotel & many other lines run on adjacent streets. There's literally no need for a car if you stay here, altho they do offer a valet service & there's many parking lots nearby. In the vicinity you'll find a plethora of banks, coffee shops, convenience stores, Pacific Centre mall & an endless variety of food offerings from $1 pizza to high end fine dining. This hotel is a gem for its price & location alone! One of the best things about our stay, however, was that the night before checkout, as we had to leave @ 5:30am the next morning, we asked the lady @ the front desk whether there might be a chance to get a little breakfast pack to go as we would be leaving much earlier than the breakfast room opened. She said she would look into it & get back to us. A few minutes later, she rang our room to say she'd made up some breakfasts for us. My BF went down to get them and it was absolutely amazing! We were honestly expecting something simple like PB&J sandwiches but in fact she'd packed us each a juice box, 2 types of muffins (I got cranberry & blueberry, yum!), a savoury bagel w/butters & cream cheese, apples & cutlery! This was definitely above & beyond anything we'd expected. My one niggle, and to be fair it's not the hotel's fault, is that one night when it was quite warm & I had the window opened a crack, there was some noise which carried up from the street of some people enjoying the weekend. However, once the window was shut & curtains drawn there wasn't an issue.

I guess it all depends on what part of the world people are from and what type of neighborhood you are comfortable with. The east side of Vancouver downtown, while some people consider it \"sketchy\" or \"seedy\", is really far less dangerous compare to the bad parts of some other big cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago or even San Francisco. Yes you do see a few homeless people but more you noticed is the shops and restaurants around this area so it is not a major disturbance. I spent a couple days at this hotel after a week of conference and walked around this area day and night, never even felt unsafe once. In fact, I consider the location of this hotel quite convenient as it is within walking distance to the Convention Center (about 3.5 blocks southeast at Richards) and close proximity to Gastown, Chinatown and even Yaletown. Now about the hotel. Ramada Limited is operated from within a historical building so facility wise, it is no surprise to me this property is a bit old but overall I must say Ramada did a pretty okay job renovating the premise. My room is bit on the crammed side especially with a big bed in the middle (which takes up 60+% of the space) but otherwise clean and considered comfortably furnished. Bathroom looked fresh as well. I do wish Ramada can do without the bulky armoire and put in a LCD tv but generally speaking I really can't fault much about the facility - it is neither new or modern but definitely OK. Service wise, on the other hand, is quite good. Staff is friendly and do try to help in every occasion. Rate is also quite reasonable considering free internet and breakfast (OK selection) are included. I saw quite a few tour groups and senior citizens checking in and out during my two-day stay there so I assume this is a preferred property for many tourists. Overall, I would rate this hotel pleasant but nothing really special. If I return to Vancouver and choose Ramada again, I will more likely select the Ramada Downtown on Granville as that is a much better renovated property and price is totally comparable.

As an older solo female traveller I often felt I was given less consideration than couples and groups. Hence when I yet again got the noisiest room in the house, instead of accepting it as I had in other places, I complained bitterly. I felt I'd done more than my fair share. I was told the hotel was full and I couldn't be moved. (Possibly true on account of the Stanley Cup.) Next morning I complained again and was referred to the duty manager. My room was changed at that point to a room on a higher floor at the back of the hotel. This was satisfactory although it was lucky I was awake when two men started conversing outside my door on my first morning in that room. It's unreasonable to expect the hotel to be able to do much about inconsiderate guests until they get to the really loud party stage. Unfortunately. Both rooms were more than adequate for size and desk space for computer use. Both had tea/coffee but not fridge or microwave. Both had good sized bathrooms with shower over bath. The room I finished up in (606) had a weird electrical connection. The bedside lamp and the light outside the bathroom were somehow connected. If you turned off the bedside lamp the other light stayed on. At that point you don't feel like leaping out of bed to turn off another light. I fixed this by plugging the bedside lamp into another socket - luckily the cord reached far enough. Breakfast was 'standard ramada' - adequate but not exciting.

The hotel corridors themselves smell very musty and are in general need of modernising but it was ideal for us with its location and reasonable price. We stayed again at this hotel for the end of our trip and this time were given a room on the 5th floor, room 506. This room was like a completely different hotel (except the musty smell in the corridors), with 2 large windows which in the far distance you could see towards the dock. This room was much larger and whilst it had the same decor as the room we had previously stayed in, the natural light made it feel alot nicer. We were also able to have the windows open properly. It was however quite noisy and we were awaken at 6AM by noises coming from outside the hotel, it sounded like big dustcarts or something and went on for a good hour. Despite the checkout time being 12PM, housekeeping start banging on doors at 8AM so we were then woken again. Normally we would be up by this time having breakfast but as we had a late night flight back to London we wanted a bit of a lie in. As it was pouring with rain I called Reception to see if we could keep the room until 4pm so that we could head out into the City but then return for a quick shower before we had to make our way to the airport. I was told we couldn\u2019t keep the room but they would give us another one for $100. Personally I thought this was disgusting, $100 for 4 hours, it wasn\u2019t as though the hotel were busy, they could have offered us the room for an extra 4 hours no charge especially given how poor the weather was. They were however able to offer us storage for our luggage so we could go out in the day without dragging it around with us. Overall I would say this hotel is ideal for a flyby visit to Vancouver but request a room on a higher floor.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, CA", "Title": "\u201cIffy\u201d", "Author": "llhcpa", "ReviewID": "UR113122383", "Content": "We were just looking for a place to sleep a couple of nights as we were out touring both days we were there.

We lucked out with brilliant Sept 30 - Oct 2 weather. The view from the plane of Vancouver at twilight was absolutely spectacular. What a gorgeous city. Our bag showed up (not headed to Cancun as on a previous flight to Vancouver) and our taxi fare to the Ramada Limited Downtown on Pender St was about $50. It was dark by our arrival time and there were 2 or 3 rather seedy looking characters lying about in doorways near the hotel, which was slightly disconcerting, but they ignored us. (This hotel is not in a bad area, but sadly, like many other large cities, Vancouver seems to have quite a few seemingly homeless younger men [some women] and they loiter about requesting handouts in many tourist areas of the city.) The reception clerk was friendly and efficient. We were nicely welcomed, given the keys to our room, and took the elevator (where the guest must insert the room key to get the elevator to move) to the 3rd floor and settled down for a long night's sleep. The room was small, but quite adequate for our needs. Both the bedroom and bathroom were clean, the sheets and towels were crisp and clean, in good condition and our room was very quiet. Because of jet lag we were wide awake by 5 AM and enjoyed the room's coffee maker. Breakfast in the lower level was served at 6 AM and turned out to be quite amazing. There were real glass glasses, real pottery cups, real, heavy duty silverware, real plates. One didn't even have to bus. The breakfast room hostess was very friendly, helpful and efficient. The food choices were similar to other moderately priced hotels, but with real orange juice, as well as bananas, apples, yogurt, bagels, cereal, toast, hard boiled eggs, a hot egg/sausage dish, donuts etc. What we found most impressive with this almost 100 year old hotel was the friendliness and efficiency of the staff. A request to remove an overstuffed chair which kind of blocked our closet entrance, was immediately taken care of. From breakfast hostess, to desk clerks, to housekeeping staff, it was a happy experience for us to be there.

The shower was a total joke, and breakfast in the morning wasn't impressive - in a tiny room in the basement with only bagels and pancakes as the hot options, and only maybe seating for 20-30 guests at most.

Rooms have standard amenities and free wireless internet which was welcome, although connection dropped occasionally. Bathroom style is more classic, clean and comfortable. A fridge and microwave can be rented at $15/day or $50/stay. Note that some rooms have no view as they face a wall. We were a little surprised to discover this and that it was not mentioned anywhere. After a couple of nights and cabin fever set in, we managed to get moved to a room with a view which was far better. The hotel is set in a safe but lively area. It is on the border of a less desirable part of town. There are a couple of homeless shelters and hostels in the area, making it buzz a little at night. Some of the loiterers are more of a nuisance than a danger, but my partner got harassed every time she went out which bugged her quite quickly. There is no restaurant, but Yagers bar next door provided a good range of bar drinks and lighter snacks which were delicious and good value. You get a 10% discount on production of your Ramada key. Breakfast is included with this hotel which is one of the best value hotels in Vancouver. If you're driving then you need to find overnight parking. Secure valet parking is available but is quite expensive. There are some public (non secure) car parks available for overnighters but this can add up. This is an older hotel which has ever basic comfort and most importantly friendly and professional staff. If on an overnight then the rooms without view would be ok but only if you're arriving at night and leaving early. Otherwise make sure you get a room facing the street, preferable facing North or West which are the quietest. South facing rooms are the noisiest.

To be honest for a city like Vancouver you could not ask for better value to be right down town. We prepaid on line and saved 15% for a total around $80 a very good price for a downtown location.

Having lived in Montreal and now Toronto, we found the neighbourhood quite tame. Yes we were solicited for money by a homeless person near the hotel once over the 4 days, BUT we were also asked for money in front of many different hotels across the whole downtown. (We were on foot). What amazed us the most in this respect is that Vancouver's homeless/money solicitors did not seem to be confined to one area, but rather, they are spread across the city. Had we stayed at a $150 per night hotel ONLY for the reason of not having homeless people ask us for money, then we would have been disappointed. In conclusion, each person is different. However, having no car, we thought this hotel was EXCELLENT VALUE for the money we paid ($63 per night).

However, when we went to check out, the woman at the front desk handed us the keys and told us to get the car ourselves. She sent us out in the rain to a dark alley, and when her directions did not lead us to where our car would be and we walked back to the front desk, she reminded us that valet service was unavailable until 7am and we would need to go back and look everywhere for our car if we REALLY needed it. She stated that if she were in our position and she REALLY needed her car, she would be walking all throughout the parking garage trying to find her car instead of asking the employees to help her.

Most were positive and I understood that this would not be a 'five star' hotel. That being said, I booked this hotel for a romantic getaway. My first impression was....\"great location, old world charm, clean rooms, and an excellent complimentary breakfast\". All of these were true. This hotel is close to Gastown and Chinatown, a couple blocks away from the waterfront, three blocks away from Robson street shopping, and is a short ride away from Stanley Park. With a good pair of shoes, an understanding of the bus system, and a flexible time schedule, you could see the whole city in 2 to 3 days. The hotel itself is nice. Classic charm, nice lobby, free WiFi, helpful staff, decent valet service, and the rooms are clean. One of the best features of this hotel is the complimentary breakfast. Hot pancakes or french toast, hot eggs, cold cereal, fruit, toast, milk, juices, tea, coffee, etc. They even have a microwave for those who want to heat up their own meal. Also, there are two good restaurants close by (Malone's Bar and Grill and The Century Restaurant and Bar) and several night spots to dance the night away. Now, the bad stuff. The valet parking is $25 dollars a night! Period! I was mislead to believe that the valet parking was complimentary. With not many on street parking spots available and parking lots with NO 'in/out' privileges, the valet parking is your only real option. This added cost will make your 'good deal' room rate go up to an average to high room rate. The rooms are sort of small but, that is not the issue. The room we had was poorly vented. The fan in the bathroom didn't do a good job of removing moisture. Our bathroom had mold in the shower. Unacceptable! The hotel is suppose to be a non-smoking building but, cigarette smoke was inside the elevator every time we got in it. I know its possible for a person who just left the elevator to smell it up but, all the time? The walls of the hotel/rooms seem thin because we could hear any and all activity in the hallways and some from other rooms. Another negative is the construction going on in the city of Vancouver. Expect to have delays getting around town during the day. Also, with the 2010 Olympics coming to this town, its best to book a trip now BEFORE summer. After that, you are going to be in a Olympic size mess of people! Now, the issue with 'street people' as mentioned in other reviews was not a factor with us. We live in the Seattle, WA area. People asking for money, wanting you to buy something from them, or people just wanting to yell at you is an every day event. Granted, if you are traveling with your family, I recommend staying away from the area between Gastown and Chinatown all the time (day or night) and not walking around the hotel at night. Other than that, the street people are harmless. Overall, we had a great time.

There was a bathroom with toileteries, TV, coffee-maker, chest of drawers, etc and room to store our suitcases.

There is no restaurant or bar although there is a bar providing food next door. We did not try this so cannot comment on its suitability. Free continental breakfast is available. We liked this as it avoids either paying over-the-odds for an in-house breakfast or having to look outside for someone suitable.

Well, when we got to our room, it was only a double (and it was very short, our feet hung off the end, and we are average height). I called the front desk to ask why, and she said because we booked on Expedia, we were not guaranteed a bed size, and that was all they had. I felt very cheated, and she made it sound like if we had booked directly, we would have gotten a better room. Also, the parking was super expensive, it cost us $25 per day, plus tipping the valet, and tax on top of it all.

The service in there was awesome and they kept it very clean. It was just amazing that for the price of the hotel all of these things were so well done. The area is not too bad. I am from the coast so I knew what to expect. You are a block from where things are really \"cleaned up\" in the downtown area. There are a lot of homeless people in Vancouver - they go there because of the climate and there is alot of soup kitchens and such. I only passed two on my way to and from the hotel....which I dont think is bad. You get that even in the $400 per night hotels. The hotel is close to lots of restaurants (sushi, pubs, etc) and if you are a Tim Horton's fan, there is one a block south west of the hotel...which is handy. Pacific Centre mall and Robson street shopping are only 3 ish blocks away....which is very good too. All in all I was blown away. I will be staying again in February because this trip was so excellent. The only issue some may have is that because it is an historical building I think the walls are thinner than the new hotels.

I was allowed to check in early, got free local calls and internet, had guests to visit in my room with no bother. Room was spotless and nicely decorated. Shower had great water pressure compared to other place. After a day of shopping I did not want to get out of that shower! Lovely. Breakfast was pretty good tho meatless ... after a night on the town, I appreciated all the free juice! The pub downstairs was actually really good too. The owner was working the door and kept the crowd age appropriate and not too rowdy/drunk. Sweetheart never gave me a problem as I went in and out to smoke, stop in my room, &c even tho he had a lineup going. The only drawbacks were that the room was a tiny bit cramped (too much furniture). A final word about the neighbourhood. Street people and filthy streets is a VANCOUVER problem not a hotel problem.
