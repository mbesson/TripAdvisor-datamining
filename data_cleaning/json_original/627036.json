We normally stay at Summer Bay Resorts or Westgate Resorts. This place did not compare to either however, it was great compared to any high price hotel. We had the smallest room that was equipped with a king size bed and a sofa sleeper with a full kitchen. The door way leading into the suite was musty and dirty but we were only there for seconds at a time. Breakfast was very simple. The staff were NOT friendly. The location is wonderful. Minutes from Sea World, Disney and Universal. We were able to veiw all three park's fireworks at the same time. Lake view OK, pool needed some help and no tiki bar. We were busy doing so much that we did not use the pool area. Shopping right across the street along with mini golf. This was very conveinant since we had the Orlando Go Card and activites were in walking distance. I would suggetst staying here first before going to a 5 star resort but for a quick stop over you can't beat the price.. I am planning to go there summer of 2009 for a week before we stay at Orange Lake Resorts for our second week in Orlando. Prices are high and gas is worse so a penny saved is well worth the dirt.", "Date": "August 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Thomas Ontario", "Title": "\u201cSecond Rate\u201d", "Author": "charandr", "ReviewID": "UR7430609", "Content": "My review is not unlike the one before mine. The room smelt musty upon entrance and was not ventilated. The carpets were so dirty in fact that we all kept our shoes on. My young son wore sandals on the bottom of his feet the entire time or they would turn black. Next, believe it or not, I actually put out my back for 24 hrs. because the sofa had no spring support left in it. It gets worse. The bathtub would not drain properly and so after our showers we would be standing in 8 inches of shower water. Also no bathroom fan and paint peeling throughout. The water smelt like well water to boot. To be fair, the pool area was nice and so was the outdoor hot tub, but the Tikibar they advertize was closed because they lost their liquor license. This is a $49 dollar a night room, not $120 like they advertize. Wouldnt stay here again if they offered me free accomodation.

We liked the deck by the lake but the walkways, stairs etc need some repair , most of the wood is ripe. It was average and we wouldn't stay here again. The location is pretty good.

If you want clean, affordable, convenient accomodations this is it!! Definite three star plus hotel.This place is located at mile marker 12 on RT 192, just about 5 miles from the Disney entrance. Also, right around the corner from RT 535 which gives you a direct route (about 5 miles) to downtown Disney also. Word of advice, if you book this thru ANOTHER website, be sure to call the hotel directly to confirm. Our reservations were listed under a wholesaler, so I had to call the website customer service. They called the hotel directly then called me back within one hour to re-confirm my reservation. I then re-called the hotel and \"Mary\" told me all was confirmed. We rented the executive suite with king bed. Bed was fine. Pillows were thin but I used three so no big deal. Had a full kitchen. Took advantage of the continental breakfast pastries and drove to the nearest Dunkin Donuts for our morning coffee. This is not a knock on the breakfast offered, I'm just partial to DD coffee. Cont breakfast was standard juice, bagels, pastry, make your own waffles, cereal, and egg breakfast sandwiches made to order for an extra $2.25. We had a room at the back of building #8 with a view of the lake. Definitely ask for rooms in the back......they are much quieter. Also, if you dont like to walk to the pool or breakfast, ask for a room in buildings #1 thru 4. These are closest to the pool etc. Your cc will be charged IN FULL at checkin, so make sure you review the quoted rate. Be advised that they add on a $6.50 a day resort fee........and its non-negotiable. Basically covers the breakfast cost and in-room safe rental. I really didnt care since I still got a good deal even with this added in. Daily maid service was fine. She even washed our dishes!! I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "February 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "colorado", "Title": "\u201cwonderful place to stay....\u201d", "Author": "pulsecolo", "ReviewID": "UR6778170", "Content": "What a dream...

Our experience at the hotel was very pleasant. When we checked in at the front desk, the lobby was nicely decorated with holiday spirit and the front desk person was very friendly. She greeted us with a smile and was very professional. Once we got in our room, we found it to be very clean and tidy. The full kitchen was a nice surprise. We thought it was just going to have the mini-fridge and microwave like most \"suite\" hotels, but it was just like being at home with full size appliances. All the untensils and dishes were included. Super Target was right across the street, so we were able to get our groceries and cook in the room some evenings. I'll be honest, the hotel needs some updating, but my wife was very pleased with how clean everything was. Our kids loved the pool area and went swimming every night. We couldn't get over the breakfast that was served every morning. It had everything from fresh fruit to waffles. My kids loved the Mikey waffle maker and had to have one each morning. If we ever needed anything, the staff was very helpful in making sure our stay was comfortable. We had such a great time, we ended up staying another 2 nights. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking for a great value close to the theme parks.", "Date": "January 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta GA", "Title": "\u201cwhat a nightmare!\u201d", "Author": "sunnyslope", "ReviewID": "UR6169298", "Content": "The worst place I have ever been...Motel6 felt like a first class hotel compared to this one. The staff was very uncaring and rude. The girl at the front desk would not look at you and would give short and rude answers. When we got to our room at first it smelled like mold, the counter was set with two broken glasses, the refrigerator was dirty and it had curly hair in there!! They did not have enough towels in the bathroom , and I only noticed that when I was already in the shower (which by the way was spraying water everywhere and it had a loud piercing noise coming out of it, I couldn't wait to get out of the shower..it gave me a head ache!) my husband called the front desk they told him someone would bring one right away... well , no one showed up so my husband had to walk all the way to the front desk, just to be told she did not have any ...well that was around 4pm.. we left for dinner came back and still no towel...The nightmare was not over yet.. the sofa bed was broken so we had to put the very thin mattress on the floor... the blankets were in TERRIBLE condition,(I should have taken a picture of it!) homeless shelters would be offended with those blankets!! it was so thin it had several huge holes in it...not to mention the terrible smell!!! We didn't dare ask for another one...needless to say we canceled the remaining nights and could not wait until morning so we could get out of there!!! By the way, it should be illegal for them to charge a \"resort fee\" the sand around the playground was full of litter... the deck was in serious need of repair with rotten and missing boards... the lake was a puddle of green water, infested with insects and it smelled really bad...at check out we tried to kindly explain our dissatisfaction with the manager but the way she reacted, she was sick of listening to that same story so she paid no attention to it...that's SAD!", "Date": "November 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albertson, New York", "Title": "\u201cHighly Recommend\u201d", "Author": "FireGirl38", "ReviewID": "UR5975058", "Content": "Just got back from our Florida Vacation and we could not ask for a better hotel to stay at with the budget we were working with for our trip. We booked this hotel through AAA after reviewing other hotels in the area. We felt that this hotel offered us with everything that we would want during our 7 day stay in Kissimmee. We were weary in the begining after reading other reviews about the hotel, originally called the MainStay Suites then a name change to the Lakeside Suites Hotel and then changed to the Lake Suite Hotel. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and checked in fairly quickly. They had our reservations all set and our room was ready and we were given the correct room. We were given a map of the grounds and the desk clerk showed us where our room was, room #904 an excutive suite. Also we were informed of the times that the Continental breakfast was served and the hours the pool/jacuzzi was available. We found our room very easily. The room was clean and neat. Did a once over on the room before settling in to make sure everything worked. I had found a spoon in the drain of the sink when I had turned the garbage disposal on and had reported that to the front desk and they came and cleaned that out for me and replaced a burnt out bulb. The house keeping staff was very nice and was there everyday, came back to a clean room everyday. Everyone there was polite and cheery. The location was great. There was a Super Target across the street from the hotel and a Super Wal-Mart down the street. Plenty of places to eat at within either a short walk or drive. Close to Disney and Sea World at most a 1/2 hour drive. They have great deals for tickets to the parks and a shuttle to and from the parks, we decided to drive to them ourselves b/c some of the drop off/pick up times were too early when the parks were open late. Overall we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking for a great place to just relax at a great price. We are in our mid 20s but there were families there with young kids and other couples without children there.", "Date": "October 20, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Lake Suites Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34352-d627036-Reviews-Lake_Suites_Hotel-Kissimmee_Florida.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "627036", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/c0/41/87/lake-suites-hotel-thumbnail.jpg"}}
