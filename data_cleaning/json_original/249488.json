The landscaping is beautiful, the room and bathroom spacious and up-to-date, and resort staff are all gracious. The facilities (pools, Golden Door spa, water slides, beach at Palomino Island) of El Conquistador resort adjoining really made it work. Visits to the El Yunque rainforest and kayaking the bioluminescent bay nearby (really, really special) added just enough non-beach activity to keep us happy. I would recommend getting a rental car to enable getting off-resort to get to off-site restaurants and elsewhere. The only major drawback is that the food at on-site restaurants is very pricey ($16 hamburgers with soggy french fries) and barely mediocre (think Denny's quality and inexplicable substitution of romaine and tomatoes for \"fresh baby greens and avocado\"). I'm comfortable with the price but fail to understand why a Waldorf Astoria resort would tolerate such lousy food.

There's a great Infiniti pool by the casitas or jump on the golf cart shuttles and head over to conquistadors big pool or down to the boat that delivers you to their beautiful private island.

Two kids (9 and 6) Kids loved the fantastic pools. Not only at the Las Casitas property but also the neighboring El Conquistador resort (same resort family) Palomino island was also great. I swam to the Palominito islet from Palomino. Awesome clear blue waters. Palomino island is owned by the Resort. Resort itself is huge. Be prepared to walk around. However for us it wasn't a problem since we were looking for a bit of a cardio anyway :-) There is however a shuttle service between the Casitas and the Conquistador. Golf courses were beautiful to look at (we don't play golf) We didn't care that there wasn't a beach at the property itself. Palomino island took care of that. There cleaned the room twice a day. Great !! Well serviced. Downsides: (minor ones) Shower in room had no power. Since we visited during spring break, the resort was quite busy and didn't receive great service at the Blossoms restaurant. Weren't happy about that. However decided to let go in the larger scheme of things. Would definitely visit this resort again. The kids loved the pools as well as the hot tubs. The Casitas pool over looks the Caribbean sea. The view was simply out if this world. Also one of the hot tubs over looks the sea.

We were absolutely thrilled with our experience again this year! Our one bedroom Casita overlooked the ocean. The bedroom overlooked a beautiful courtyard and pool. The Casita had space for our two children to stay on air mattresses in the living room. The room was spotless and cleaned to perfection each day. The Manor House staff is so warm and welcoming! Lillian (Lilly), Eddie, Max (Las Casitas Manager), Sonia (food and beverage) were especially gracious and wonderful!! They welcomed us back as if we are family and everyone who assisted us was professional and courteous, happy to offer suggestions. The pools at Las Casitas are beautiful, and were never crowded. The infinity pool is the most popular, but we had no difficulty finding seats and loved the view. Our stay was during spring break/Easter, and we never found the property crowded. We loved Palomino Island, and made sure we brought our water shoes as the sandy areas can become rocky with coral. We rented Kayaks, snorkeled and were impressed that even during spring break the island did not seem too overpopulated. One thing we tried was spending mornings at a Las Casitas pool then heading to Palomino for the afternoon. It seems to significantly empty out around 2pm, and we had a great time! The lunch restaurant at Las Casitas near the infinity pool was exceptionally nice with very good sandwiches. The grounds are beautiful and we often walked from Las Casitas to the main hotel. We tried restaurants off the property for dinner. We very much love La Estacion! Metropol was also quite good. Bohio was an authentic experience and lots of fun with a warm welcome from the owner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family members. We highly recommend Mini Boat Adventures! The electric boat bio bay tour is also great. Las Casitas is the perfect destination for an amazing family vacation!

This time we opted not rent a car and instead used the hotel bus which was fine as we only went off the Waldorf property 1 night via taxi for dinner at El Passione (our favorite). Because we booked late we were at the furthest end of Las Casitas from the hotel which of course means a longer wait for transport to get to the hotel. Even though the weather was not perfect, we had some great afternoons at the small but adequate waterpark and one afternoon where we invited friends over to hotel-owned Palamino (sp?) Island where our daughter took her ritual horseback ride (don't expect a true aquestrian experience) and our son discovered the oversized chess set which facilitated meeting other kids.

Cons: 1. There should have been more parasols (umbrellas) by the pool. 2. The water park wasn't much of a water park. (make sure to go after 1pm for half price entrance fee) 3. The funicular (cablecar like shuttle) was required for access to Palomino as well as the water park. They really need to create another means of transport since the funicular took awhile. 4.

The accommodations were very nice. The views are spectacular. We reserved a 1 bedroom 'garden' view, but our condo had a great view of the ocean and the rainforest. We had 4 in our group(2 adults, 2 teens) and the room was more than comfortable enough for all. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. There was supposed to be 'butler' service, but we never met our butler(usually introduced at check in, but we just went straight to our condo and we missed him), but we really didn't need him. Try to request a room on the NORTH side of the complex or close to the infinity pool, the walk to the hotel is very easy if you are on the north side. We never had to use a golf cart or van to get to the hotel. The private island is very nice but took a while to get there via boat ferry. But we prefer unsalted waters anyway and spent most of our lounge time in the infinity pool. If you want to do any water sports on the private island(jetski, kayak, etc), reserve early, it books up fast. If there is any negative to this resort, it would be the high prices at the restaurants. The food and service at all restaurants were very good, but pricey. We ate at Drakes, Stingrays, Cafe Bella Visa and Ballyhoo. Other nights we ate off the resort in San Juan, Fajardo, or Luqillio. Since we had a kitchen we bought our own breakfast foods and ate in our condo(on the balcony). The location was perfect for us as most of the excursions we wanted to do were in the NE side of the island. It is about 60+ minutes to Old San Juan, 30 minutes to El Yunque, 10 to 15 minutes to marinas that offer snorkeling or bio bay tours. Las Casitas offers free parking vs 10-15/day at the hotel. They also offer free wifi, which I believe is also additional cost at the hotel. With Las Casitas, you get access to all the pools on the entire resort, Hotel guests are not allowed in the Las Casitas pools.

Las Casitas Villages is the Villa/Condo section of El Conquistador Resort. These units include a full kitchen, living room and a large patio/balcony. We have stayed in several Carribean units of these type (Harborside Atlantis, Westin St. John) and this unit had by far the largest rooms. Each of the three bathrooms had an enormous bathtub. The master bath even had a bidet! THE UNITS HAD INCREDIBLE SOUNDPROOFING, the least outside noise I've ever had in a resort stay. The unit (thank you Yadisse) and ground were spotless and we regularly saw staff maintaining the expansive property. One thing missing from the unit was a washer/dryer relatively common in such units. Instead, they offer a \"wash and fold\" service where you can fill a laundry bag full of clothes and they'll turn it around in a day for $25. Onsite self-laundry would be a plus. We highly recommend this resort for families travelling with children. We'd also recommned renting a car (<1 hr drive from airport) which isn't much more expensive than paying for airport transfers and gives you the flexibility to shop for groceries (Ralphs is <15 minutes away right off Route 3, and is comparable to a large grocery store in the upper 48) and go on excursions. We very much enjoyed RAINFOREST ZIPLINE, EL YUNQUE RAINFOREST, LOQUILLO KIOSKS, and ERIN GO BRAGH SNORKEL CHARTER ere able to get \"in and out\" in a way not possible if you did a bigger, more organized tour. Our advice is to get groceries for breakfast and lunch and splurge for dinners on-site. We did go to the Loquillo Kiosks one night and enjoyed Jefe Burger (order your dinner here then browse other kiosks while you wait) and a great Cheesesteak at Richys. The Casitas are perched on a cliff with a wonderful view. There are three pools reserved for Casitas guests that were never full, including a beatiful infinity edge pool overlooking the ocean. Just a five minute walk (albeit with lots of uphill steps) gets you to the El Conquistador main hotel area which includes another 2 large pools and most of the available restaurants. Another five minutes get you to the funicular which takes you down to the Marina where you can catch the ferry to Palomino Island (great Parasailing, thanks Captain Joy and a solid horseback ride are available). There is solid snorkelling just yards off the beach and several kid friendly activities like mini golf, basketball and soccer. Alternatively, you can go to the small waterpark which features 3 great slides perfect for 6-14 year olds. After 1:30, it is about half price and at 4 pm, it drops to just $5. The Casitas also offers shuttle service to the main hotel that was variably reliable. Several times, we called and a ride was waiting within minutes of our call but on more than one occasion, we waited much longer. We were pleased with the onsite dining, rating Stingray (seafood) our favorite. Informal dining at Ballyhoo and Cafe Bella Vista (great non-alcoholic drinks!) were both excellent. We had Hibatchi/Tappanyaki at Blossoms and it was solid. Our only disappointing dinner was at Cafe Caribe which had an overdose of fried food. The snack bar at Coqui Waterpark had great snacks, including fairly priced root beer floats. We were impressed with the friendliness of the staff including Yolanda, Lilly and Wanda.

The adjacent El Conquistador offers the large, convention hotel experience of big restaurants, pool bar with music and adults wandering around in the pool with beer cans. The restaurant quality was inconsistent and prices are high. Sugary rum drinks abound! But, you can spend most of your time on the Casitas side and only dip into the big hotel experience when necessary. Tennis is free, the golf course looked like fun but we did not play. Iguanas are everywhere and our children kept track of the number of smaller lizards they saw (very cute lizards). Offsite dining is available for the mildly adventurous- we had a fabulous, fun and authentically local meal two minutes outside of the hotel gate. We did rent out own car for the week, as airport transfers and what the hotel would charge for a day trip into old San Juan for our family of five exceeded the weekly cost of the rental. We will probably return, and hope to see more of the island as well as the outlying islands of Culebra and Viecques on our next trip.

Kids loved the beach and we took an amazing kayak ride to a smaller \"deserted island\" close to the island. Pools were clean and not overcrowded. The infinity pool at the Las Casitas was amazing. 5 STARS LOCATION : While about an hour away from San Juan which is still a reasonable drive, the resort is in an ideal location to explore Puerto Rico.

Island offers water sports, swimming in calm waters, basketball hoop, soccer net and lunch and drinks. Water park will keep the kids occupied for hours. Main pool is nice, but it gets a bit nasty by late afternoon. It could use a mid-day cleaning. Lunch and breakfast are fine. For dinner, try the dorado or lobster tail at Stingray at the marina. Chicken or lobster tail at the Strip House (steaks only average) and hit Blossoms for the sushi and Japanese hibachi. Brick oven pizza option great for a more casual meal. Be sure to try the Ballyhoo drink at the Ballyhoo bar in the marina. Golf course is great, even for a quick 9 holes. Also check out the inshore fishing with Capt.

Be warned - the room rates, restaurants, groceries, activities, parking, and everything else at the resort are crazy expensive. If you prepare yourself before making the trip and accept the fact that you will be paying nearly double for everything you do, you will have a wonderfully great time. We stayed for 6 nights and spent 10k for everything - air, hotel, car rental, meals, entertainment, etc. Most of the other reviews will give you a good idea of what the resort is like. If you're like me, the deciding factor on staying at Las Casitas is all about money. Here are a few tips on saving some money that may help. Our group of 5 included 2 adults and 3 teenagers. How to save some money - We booked our room through the Hilton reservation 800 number. They were extremely helpful in getting us the best rate possible and made us aware of current programs. They hooked us up with the \"Puerto Rico Getaway\" program that takes a substantial percent off of your room, provides free drink certificates, 20% off Spa services, $25 matching gift card for the casino, and more. Having a full kitchen allowed us to shop at the local grocery store to save money on meals. The hotel offers a shopping service that allows you to order your groceries through the hotel for a $25 initial fee, plus $5 for each additional order. I do not recommend using this service. The groceries that the hotel provides are at the hotel prices not the local grocery store price. Besides, shopping with the locals was an adventure all its own. We tried nearly all of the restaurants at the resort. All of the high end places are over rated and overpriced. None of them compared to big city steak, seafood, Italian, or Chinese places we've been to. If you eat at the resort try the less formal outdoor places and order off the children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s menu. We found the children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s portions are nearly as big as the normal portions with no difference in food quality. Also, there are plenty of places to eat within a 10 minute drive. All of your major fast food chains are close by with several really nice local places as well. Bottom line - you will save money on every meal you eat outside of the resort. Unlike previous visits, we booked all of our activities on our own and did not use the hotel recommended vendors. This saved us a substantial amount of money and I believe the vendors we used (via trip advisor) provided better service. You do not need a tour guide for the rainforest. There are only 3 or 4 hiking trails and all are clearly marked. It has an educational center with a $4 entrance fee. This includes a very informative movie in a small theater. If you are celebrating an anniversary, birthday or any other special occasion the hotel will provide a $40 bottle of champaign in your room on arrival. Nice of them! If you ask, they will pack your fridge with a case of their bottled water (Las Casitas brand!) free of charge. This saved us tons of money as a bottle of water at many places is about $3. There is no difference in quality. Las Casitas has free Wi Fi throughout the village and in the rooms. Although they offer a \"premium\" Wi Fi service we found the free service to be fast and reliable. This was great and allowed us to instantly look up places to eat or things to do without having to go to the business center. Snorkeling gear rental at the resort is about $25 per day. I bought 5 full sets (mask, fins, and snorkel) on the internet for $20 each and packed them in our suit cases. I ended up selling all 5 sets to a family on the beach for $50. Long story short, we used high quality gear for the entire week and it cost me less than it would if I rented theirs for a single day. Pack your own water shoes, sun screen, hats, sun glasses, bug spray, and under water cameras. You will need ALL of them and they are all VERY overpriced. Hope this helps.

For us this was the perfect combination..lots of exploring in OSJ...visiting El Yunque en route to Faradjo and then Las Casitas. Welcome was pleasant and efficient, villa ready in Casitas 2 section which we liked...even a bit more quiet than Casitas 1 and extraordinary views. Request some combination with a top floor for maximum views...but really they are all nice. Villa was a one bedroom oceanview and really comfortable and well equipped. We took a package with breakfast and could go to either Casitas Cafe (very close) or over to the main resort. We did both, clearly the main resort has more selection but both were nice. More peaceful at Las Casitas. Pools were nice; however we did go during a very busy holiday time including Three Kings weekend and so pools were often taken over by kids with little parental supervision. Its a family resort so that is to be expected. If you can avoid known school holidays I'm sure it would be much quieter. We managed to find pool time but had to jockey a bit. Service throughout both Las Casitas and El Con was excellent and staff very pleasant. Was everything always perfect ?...did you have to ask for expected service?..yes sometimes, but overall it was excellent and frankly far superior to what I was expecting. Funiculars, ferry to island etc. all were working and we never waited for anything. Palamino Island is extraordinary and you feel as if you are in the South Seas...really...easy to find your own spot. The restaurant over there was awful with high prices. It needs a serious upgrade. Swimming is not great...you need shoes with the coral and more importantly unless you are adept at these kinds of waters maybe stay out. We saw a man being carried on a stretcher after getting tangled up in coral and being rescued by a fellow tourist. There are no lifeguards. We loved Palamino. Only ate at Stingray and it was very busy but reservation honored and service good. Food good as well. One thing it is important to note about El Con is that it is orientated towards large groups and I don't mean family reunions. I mean incentive groups, conventions etc. and in the thousands they take the place over. I would not have enjoyed a stay at El Con. Many of the incentive groups know each other so restaurants , pools and bars can be literally taken over by them. It is very very loud and party atmosphere. They do really seem to know how to manage these groups and service did not suffer. Probably an excellent choice for such groups. This might be great for some individual travelers, but know what you are getting. Las Casitas is quiet...mostly couples or families. What is nice is you can go over a take advantage of all the facilities, restaurants etc and then return to a more tranquil environment when you want. We found that combination perfect. I would recommend booking some restaurants off site including Estacion and Passion por el Fogon. These were very good and more interesting than hotel restaurants. They are close by but require a car or taxi. As for getting around you can request a golf cart to go to the main lobby of El Con and they are available quickly. The grounds and vistas are a photographer's dream and I have included some photos taken. I visited the Golden Door spa for a massage with Claire as recommended by another TA reviewer. This was a good recommendation and I highly recommend Claire at the spa. I booked the appointment by phone in advance of arrival with Grace who was very helpful. With more time I would have gone back for sure. The location of Las Casitas is a great jumping off point for so many activities including the bio bay, El Yunque etc. I would think an active family could stay busy here for a week. I would recommend checking into booking such things as transportation and tours/activities on your own as hotel prices seems excessive...not just a bit more but way too much. Do compare. Weather was not perfect but enough sun to keep us happy and watching the rainbows from the terrace was an added bonus. I highly recommend Las Casitas. I was concerned about some reviews being negative; however I saw no evidence of lack of service and Max the general manager is totally available if you have an issue as well as the staff in the \"Manor House\" at Las Casitas.

I did get some whiffs of mustiness as I read in other reviews but I have to say the maid services were outstanding. I would also maybe go with a 2 bedroom as the one bathroom became an issue at times with twin 12 yr old girls. The balcony is awesome with beautiful trade winds constantly blowing.

Rain Forrest - rent a car as well. Easy drive and tour at your leisure. Check out El Mino Falls and go under the waterfall. Wear dryfit material and a bathing suit + watershoes. Mini-Boat Tours - Very cool. Book thru Kayaking Puerto Rico. Bioluminesent Bay - Very cool. Use Pure Adventure. Ziplinig/Rappeling - The best part of the trip.

We all loved the infinity pool - it to a beautiful spot and the kids loved all the transportation options from the golf carts, to the tram to the boat out to Palomino Island. The one thing that I do think could be improved upon are the food options, and if we were to go back, I would probably look into getting some recommendations to eat outside the resort for some of our meals. We did pay for an Aero bed which is far more comfortable for our teenager, than sleeping on a pull out couch! Just good to know if you are traveling with kids. If you are going during a school break, make sure that you have reservations for dinner as otherwise you are going to find yourself waiting and with kids that can spoil a nice night.

We ate lunch at the pool restaurant and breakfast at Las Brisas at the hotel. The breakfast buffet at Las Brisas was very good. We had a car and went out to eat locally in the evening. Enjoyed La Estacion in particular. The concierge at Las Casitas was happy to assist us with those reservations. My husband and brother-in-law enjoyed the golf and my sister-in-law and I had a message at the Golden Door Spa (very good). We were glad we picked Las Casitas over the hotel because it was much quieter with quick access to the hotel.

This is part of the El Conquistador resort. I highly recommend this over the Conquistador hotel if you want peace quiet and fewer crowds. The hotel looks nice but just walk through the villas (see attached pictures) and you will know what I mean. Truly one of the most beautiful places I've ever stayed. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even comprehend some of the negative reviews unless you are going to be extremely picky or like someone who complained because it rained!! geeze like they control that. The rooms were just gorgeous. They did have tube TV's and big screen LCD's would be nice for watching a movie on a rainy afternoon but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not enough for me to knock it. Had views from both the living room balcony (see picture) as well and the bedroom balcony. The service was the best, both concierge and especially the cleaning staff. The grounds are impeccable maintained. Three pools just for the villas one being an amazing infinity pool with a view to die for. Ended up just hanging there and soaking it all in. I would suggest getting a car to be able to explore more easily but my package included airport transfers so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother. There is a rental car agency on-site so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to rent when needed. You have great cooking facilities (although providing BBQ's somewhere would be great) so plan on doing some shopping to get things as the small convenience store is just that, small, and quite expensive. As with any place there are some negatives: 1) Restaurants at the Conquistador are very expensive and the food was just okay. I was amazed when I brought a special bottle of wine to the steakhouse and they wanted a $40 corkage charge. Just absurd and it cost them money because we ate little and saved our wine and special meal for a different night. 2) No beach on the property. You need to take their ferry to their private island to get on a beach. Nothing wrong with that but would be nice to be able to just walk to a beach. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it.

Wrong. It rained the entire week, save one afternoon. The hotel didn't offer any umbrellas or rain gear and we couldn't find any in the various on-site stores. The hotel offered no indoor amenities except for a small casino, two tiny, poorly maintained fitness rooms and the spa. The spa was outrageously expensive and the services were mediocre. My son played golf (in the wind and rain) and the course is very challenging. Even though we were virtually the only guests in the South Casita, we were put in a lower level room with limited view of the ocean. The furniture was very dated, cheap and infested with ants, the kitchen was poorly equipped, the A/C (dual-zoned) didn't work well on one side and the windows leaked badly throughout the storms. Room service was good and the concierge/bell service was excellent. Since we didn't rent a car, we ate all of our meals at El Conquistador--the food was over-priced, lousy, unimaginative hotel food. There were very few healthy alternatives and fewer \"local cuisine\" alternatives. The on-site \"grocery\" store was poorly stocked. Starbucks became my favorite hide-out/restaurant! Although the grounds were beautfiul, deferred maintenance was evident throughout the hotel and drainage was very poor. Consequently, many areas were flooded and closed. We spent the one sunny afternoon at the island--it was delightful; but all of the amenities (jet skis, snorkeling, etc) were expensive and limited availability. Since the hotel is situated on a 300 foot cliff, the island is the only beach. Even though there were several conferences going on, hotel occupancy was low and, so, the beach wasn't too crowded. I imagine that during high season, the beach would be very crowded and lines for the catamaran would be long. Phone and internet connectivity were very poor. The trip was such a disaster that we cut it short one day and left. Definitely NOT worth the price in any way, shape, or form.

Rule #1 - RENT A CAR! Las Casitas offers no additional expense to have a car on location so take advantage of it. The sister property (El Conquistador) charges for this convenience. El Conquistador does have an Enterprise rental car location within the main hotel lobby at the front desk. Unsure of the hours or rates. Rule #2 - DON'T OVER PACK TO MITIGATE EXPENSE Las Casitas offers a full kitchen (microwave, stove, fridge, ice maker, and dish washer) with the cupboards stocked with with utensils, plates, glasses and pots/pans. Within 5 miles you have access to a Kmart, Walmart, CVS, Walgreens and a dozen other stores including fast food. There were 2 Costco locations (membership required) near the airport (SJU) which we stocked up on water, soda, alcohol, fruit/veggies and snacks. We also found a wonderful dry cleaners & laundry service within 2 miles (Laundry Express) on PR-3. They charged $9 for a sack of laundry to wash/dry/fold. Dry cleaning costs were also very reasonable. Rule #3 - Get off the resort for meals. There were great restaurants off of the resort. El Pasion and La Estacion were our favorites. La Estacion is a no frills/casual BBQ destination with great food from ribs and mofongo to wings and fish. El Pasion was a great destination too - parking is behind the restaurant and service is wonderful. We did eat on the resort at the Island's restaurant which was good... order from the kids menu - same items as adults with lower prices and same qty. Disregard the disclosure of age restrictions. The restaurant next to the casino is ok... I recommend the Chicken and Rice. The Steak house has a great car area for a drink or two. Dinner is also very good. We had their mofongo (not traditional but fantastic!) and bone in ribeye. Both were very good. Off the resort are many chains for kids (Burger King, McD's, Church's Chicken) and not many chains for adults (Sizzler, Pizza Hut and Ponderosa is all we saw). Rule #4 - Plan for Rainy Days There isn't much to do when it rains (which it has 80% of this trip) including a tornado! There is a DVD rental in Las Casita's front desk area known as the \"Manor House.\" Not much activities to get into except for the spa and gym since the Casino opens at night unless you want to go to the pool during the rain. Rule #5 - You can visit the Rain Forest without paying fees When visiting the rain forrest you do not have to turn into the main entrance. The only advantage of paying the fee is obtaining a park map, visiting the park gift shop and their restaurant. Save the money and continue up the mountain! Due to an injury we couldn't hike into the mountain however one water fall and a couple stops are easily seen/visited by various parking lots along the park route. Rule #6 - Plan to walk the resort We received a wonderful Casita that was ocean front but on the south side of the resort. It's a long hike from here to the Funicular to get to the marina for the boat to the island. We lucked out and received a complimentary golf cart assigned to us for the entire stay without even asking. This added a much better experience to getting around for us. Rule #7 - Don't Stay at El Conquistador We encountered a Tornado when we were here. Due to power being out we were relocated to the main hotel for the night. Needless to say I visited 4 different rooms and all were less then par. Can't believe the Waldorf even allowed their brand for them. The ladies at the front desk of El Conquistador understood my concerns and shared how they need a full overhaul. Enter at your own risk but I would equate them to a 2 star at best. Rule #8 - Hilton Honors As a gold member I expected breakfast to be included. Not here. We did receive a complimentary pass to the Golden Door Spa gym which was wonderful and my girlfriend enjoyed their steam room and other amenities also available to this level of HHonors. Now for some other knowledge - the Casitas are all privately owned and not a time share. They are very beautiful and we truly enjoyed our rooms. The only negative we would share is the housekeeping's kitchenware cleaning. We actually made it a point to do the dishes after see what the housekeepers version of cleaning was. In addition - our person would run our dishwasher each night which perplexed us since it was empty! Towels and Wash Cloths are a commodity here! Often when requested it would be 10-30 mins until received. Room Service comes from the main hotel so expect a wait and it may not be cold/hot due to distance. We bought a cooler thinking we could bring stuff to the pool and beach. Pool - no problem. Beach - not allowed. We didn't play any golf but the course looks fantastic. We actually took a drive out to the Trump golf course 3 towns over and in my opinion this golf course beat his regardless if they host the puerto rican idol. Since the weather was so horrible we never made it to old san juan or any other islands. An interesting famous fact is that the small island next to our private island is in today's release of the latest Pirates of the Carribean. While here we also saw them shooting final auditions for \"puerto rican idol\", a wedding magazine shoot and a golf magazine shoot. Casino - Don't expect Craps. 4 BJ tables, 1 Roulette, 1 Carribean Poker and 50 slot machines (80% for $.01). The BJ table also has unusual rules that i've never experienced from when the house is dealt vs winning rules. You'll understand what I mean when you get here. Don't expect Vegas or Atlantic City Rules! Everyone else captures the lovely resort, layout, etc... I wanted to capture in my narrative when I didn't see and I would want to know. In Closing - This is a 5 star resort if you stay at the casitas and plan appropriately. Enjoy your visit - and yes, We'll be back hoping for better weather!", "Date": "May 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "minneapolis, mn", "Title": "\u201cCan't Wait To Go Back!\u201d", "Author": "prisenchanting", "ReviewID": "UR103653931", "Content": "We just returned from seven wonderful nights at Las Casitas Village! We reserved a one bedroom ocean view Casita for our family of four. The Casita was perfect! The ocean view was great and the furnishings were definitely newer and well chosen. The kitchen was new with stainless appliances, beautiful counter tops, the floors of the Casita were appealing terra cotta style tile. The room was perfectly clean-absolutely spotless upon arrival, and after each daily/nightly housekeeping it was just as beautifully serviced. We are planning return visits(already booked for 2012!), so I asked a butler to take me on a tour of other units. While our Casita was located in the south part of the village among the newer units, I was told that any units available to guests have been fully refurbished. The north end units I toured appeared just as wonderful as our unit. Our unit did not distinguish itself as different or better in any way from those that I toured-the units all looked like equally appointed wonderful accommodations. The vistas from the ocean view units I toured were all equally as stunning as our view. Las Casitas has wonderful people providing service-Lillien (Lilly) in the Manor House reception area is outstanding. She is professional, sincere, warm, kind and truly wants guests to have the vacation of a lifetime. Eddie (often in the main house and providing excellent Butler services) is also outstanding. Both are exceptional individuals with amazing knowledge of the island. Supervisors/Managers Sonia (in the Las Casitas dining area) and Yolanda (Manor House) were also especially wonderful, helpful and caring. All of the individuals that I mentioned provided us the opportunity to have that truly magical vacation as did many others! All were professional and outstandingly dedicated to the resort and its guests! The pools at Las Casitas are breathtakingly gorgeous! The infinity pool as well as the village pool are the most beautiful pool settings of any resort we have ever been to. The pools were never crowded and there were plenty of chairs, towels and shade. The golf cart transportation was perfectly timed for our family-we had an occasional very brief wait, but never did the wait concern us. The carts hold about 8 guests. Palomino Island was busiest on Saturday. Although we arrived on the third boat that Saturday, we were able to find great shade and there was never any problem with beach lounge chairs-there are more than enough even on a crowded Saturday. If you like more privacy-just walk away from the main area where the ferry docks -down the beach (around the corner and to the left) there were plenty of private, quieter spots. The snorkeling on Palomino Island is quite good and great for younger children too. TIP: Bring excellent water shoes as the sandy beach often changes to coral/rocky texture. The beauty of the island is that it also offers a very interesting beach with plenty of water activities-you can rent floats, snorkels, jet skis and kayaks. Everything was in perfect working order. The water park was fun for the kids, and I found the view from there to be among the very best at the resort. The park is built at the water's edge and you can relax on a lounge chair right near the water-without the sand! TIP: In the afternoon, the water park tickets were half price. The breakfast at Las Casitas was terrific-a beautiful setting with fine food and absolutely outstanding service. We did try a few of the other restaurants at the hotel-but only the casual ones. All service was outstanding-there were some food high points too. I was told by several guests that an Executive Chef has been hired to completely inspire the restaurants at the El Conquistador-we really look forward to some great changes! L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Estacion off the property was fabulous! There are also places all around to try-El Bahio was recommended by our BIO BAY electric boat tour, but we did not get to it. The BIO BAY electric boat tour is a wonderful way to go if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to kayak with younger children (or just prefer a nice long time boating around the biobay). Passion offered authentic food in an indoor setting with white linens (but prices seemed reasonable). For a totally local experience, the inexpensive take out at Punto Carribe (on the corner of El Conquistador Avenue-look for the Church\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chicken and next to it is Punto Carribe) was very good-locals I spoke with adore it and we were very impressed! TIP: If you are adventurous, try MINI BOAT ADVENTURES! The snorkeling was outstanding and driving the boats is a true adventure. As for the resort, there is so much to do, you can have any vacation you like-active or quiet. As for the Casitas, with a family of four, if your budget allows for it, the two bedroom casitas are probably the way to go, (We have two children of school age-they slept on air mattresses which they described as comfortable-it was a nice way to enjoy a great view/room in the high season-so it was a good option too). We have traveled elsewhere and to many exceptional, exclusive, high end resorts- I can sincerely say that this is by far the best vacation we have ever had.

There is butler service - which was ok; we didn't realize this until our 5th night so we werent able to take advantage of the service as much as if it had been advertised upfront. While Las Casitas is walkable to the main hotel, there are golf carts to take visitors to the main hotel - while convenient most of the time (make sure to call and order a golf cart before you head to the waiting spot), sometimes the wait was 5-10 min. The activities at the hotel are great - Palomino Island outstanding (albeit a 15 minute boat ride away), but they only had 1 boat to take/retrieve visitors - from Las Casitas, it takes approximately 30-40 min to get to the island (door to beach). The waterpark is small but the kids loved it (particularly the 200 foot vertical slide) - the good news for parents is that you can see the entire park from seats in the middle. There are also plenty of pools, night movies at the main hotel pool, several dining options, etc. For off-site activities - we did the El Junque rainforest (highly recommend - 45 minute ride from El Con), the light-house tour (decent - 5 minute ride, price is right $58 for family of 7), bio-luminescent bay kayak tour (expensive if you go through hotel - make sure to book offsite (you will see signs approaching the hotel); and you can walk to the site instead of taking a $15 cab rid (or 35 for family of 7)). Lots to do, but booking through hotel agency (GSI) is REALLY expensive. The rainforest was $500 for a family of 7 (had to pay for 8). We pre-ordered groceries to be delivered to our room - was a good option (they only charge an extra $25 for the first trip, $5 for each thereafter) but don't expect to get exactly what you want. The food options on-site are good but very expensive. If you need supplies, try the store at the bottom of the fanicular (on the way to the boat ride to Palominio) instead of the hotel store (which is ridiculously expensive but convenient). DO NOT TAKE THE HOTEL SHUTTLE TO EL CON - take a taxi; our van for 7 people was $85. Or rent a car, particularly if staying at Las Casitas - there are plenty of parking spaces right outside of the villas and you'll save lots on cab rides (we probably spent $1000 over the course of a week in cab rids to/from dinners, excursions, Old San Juan, etc). For off-site authentic Puerto Rican dinner - we highly recommend Passion - it is 5 min offsite. We've been there every year for the past 4 years and have never been disappointed.

We were not disappointed, our room had 2 bedrooms, 2 full bathrooms, a full kitchen and a nice living room overlooking the ocean. The rooms were clean and well appointed and staff were very friendly. The only drawback to staying at Las Casitas versus El Conquistador is that from Las Casitas you will take a shuttle or golf cart ride from the hotel to the El Conquistador where all the activities are, such as the restaurants, casino (small casino - not many tables - just black jack, caribbean stud and roulette for tables and lots of slot machines). I would recomend Las Casitas for people wanting a lot of space and who don't mind taking a quick golf cart ride, or walking up to the El Conquistador. If you don't want to walk (its a hilly walk) or take the golf cart ride, then El Conquistador or Las Marinas may be a better fit for you. You will also need to take the ferry to Palomino Island from the base of the El Conquistador, down at the Las Marinas section of the resort, where it is a less than 10 minute catamaran ride to the island and beach. The island is pretty nice. Water is quite shallow and there is some decent snorkeling. There is an outdoor restaurant and also a beach side bar, so that's pretty convenient. We ate at the resort a few times and it was ok, I'd say it was fine as far as resort food goes. Nothing extravagant, but nothing to complain about, either. We went off the resort to La Estacion down the street and I'd definitely recomend going there once to allow a chance to try a local restaurant.

No seperate shower and tub which I would expect at this price otherwise no major complaints. Was a little disappointed in the lack of mini fridgen and the 14% resort fee was a little much. The room was quiet. The resort was wonderful. We loved the infinity pool and private beach. Not crowded the week we were there, but got very crowded the day we left. Spent some time at the tables in the small casino. The blackjack dealers had a couple of rules that created a little additional unfair advantage to the player. They did not deal themselves a second card until after everyone else played out their hand. So if they were showing an ace they could still deal themselves a blackjack after you had put more money on the table by splitting or doubling down on your hand. All-in-all, we play just for fun so wasn't a big deal. Food on the property was good but way overpriced, although we had breakfast included with our package. Some people complained about the boat ride to the island, but it was quite fun and I thought it was a neat feature. Had a great meal at L'estacion, although bring bug spray.

We asked for a change of room after the 1st night and were told nothing was available with an ocean view - which we were not willing to give up. So the casita was very dated and not luxurious. A/C did not work properly so we were either freezing or sweating the entire time. Called it in but no one ever showed to fix/adjust the thermostats. The food at every restaurant we tried was okay (not superior) and ridiculously overpriced. We know fine dining and don't mind paying for it. This was not fine dining. All of the people who work at Las Casitas and El Conquistador were very pleasant. The place is so spread out that you have to walk quite a bit (up and down many staircases) to get from one area to another. The beach is a long walk, an elevator ride, a funicular ride (down the cliff), and a ferry ride away. Not very convenient at all.

The pools are not heated and with the wind whipping around us at 20 or 30 mph all week it would have helped a great deal to have a heated pool. The water park is ridiculously over priced for 3 slides and a lazy river. Guests should be allowed to use it without being charged at all. The water park is also a long walk, elevator, and funicular ride away from Las Casitas. We found two huge water bugs in our casita on 2 separate occasions (1 dead, 1 nearly dead). There are no screens on the windows or doors to the balconies so you cannot leave them open. The shades on the windows are falling apart. We found broken glass on the floor in the bedroom that our children were in which must have been there from a previous guest. Housekeeping did not have vacuum cleaners - only brooms and damp mops so they did not do a great job of cleaning. Food at outside eateries was also less than excellent. We tried Metropol and Estacion. The burger at Metropol was dry and tasteless. The mosquitos and cats dodging around Estacion made it difficult to enjoy our meals. All in all we spent a great deal of money at a hotel that did not meet our expectations.", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Annapolis, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort, worth the trip out east!\u201d", "Author": "BruceAMD", "ReviewID": "UR98717479", "Content": "We had a wonderful stay here.

I have been coming to Puerto Rico for vacations with my family since 1986, and have usually stayed in the Isla Verde / San Juan area. We decided to try some place new for 4 nights before going to meet the rest of my family in San Juan. Boy was I glad that we did. After much debate, we decided to rent a car and am so glad that we did. The restaurants located right outside of the hotel were incredible (La Estacion / Pasion) and well worth the car rental alone. The hotel is located 33 miles from the airport, and the shuttle to and from the hotel was pricey (I believe it was $74 per person round trip). When we arrived at the airport, it was pouring and the 33 miles took us about 90 minutes to do. But once arrived, holy cow! The hotel was beautiful. Sprawling grounds as we drove up, free parking for Las Casitas guests and we were greeted with bottled water. No problems at all with check in and we were given a brief tour of the immediate area. Las Casitas was gorgeous. It's own little area with 2 pools, restaurant, and very close to the amazing Golden Door Spa, which we tried and loved (though pricey!) Golf carts will take you everywhere, but we walked wherever we wanted to go. Our room was the best part. We were upgraded to a 1 BR, with a kitchenette, hot tub on the back porch and the most gorgeous ocean view I have ever seen - with 2 lounge chairs. We never needed to leave the room. I have to say, the great part about our stay is that it wasn't very crowded. There is a vehicular (not sure if that's what it's called), takes you down to the ferry where you go to the beach. We never had to wait, but I'm sure that if it was crowded, it could get annoying. Also, because it wasn't crowded at the resort, the ferries to Palomino Island (where the beach) is, only ran every hour, even on the weekends. Still, Palomino was beautiful and it has everything you'd need for a day at the beach (restaurants, bathrooms, horse back riding). During one of the days, the weather wasn't so great, and we ended up going to the Coqui Water Park. It would be great for kids, but we found it fun for a couple of hours as adults! Casino is small, but lots of cute little stores to wander into. Starbucks was key! Some great things we did: Kayak Adventures - great company and we did the rainforest / bio bay combo. Golden Door Spa: My husband did a Signature massage and I did the Spirit of LIfe combo - which was awesome!! Something unique other than then the regular massage I always do. Food: La Estacion had the best skirt steak mofongo I've ever had in my life. I'm still dreaming about it. It's my new favorite restaurant in the world (no joke!) Grocery Store: the one close by the resort has everything you need. Even had Luna Bars and Kashi cereal for lower prices than I pay in Manhattan. If only I could do my grocery shopping in Puerto Rico! The lunch place by the main pool was awesome. We had these great foccacia pizza things that were amazing. I wish we had done the Culebra Island / Flamingo Beach trip that everyone was raving about. We ran out of time.

She was very accommodating and showed us what was pictured on the website. It was beautiful, considerably larger. We found the unit we stayed in to be very tight. My husband is 6'9\" and our teens are both 6'1\". We booked the Coqui Water Park package, which included a wonderful breakfast buffet, access to the water park and transfers for the four of us to and from the airport. I was told that if we book 3 nights, we get a fourth free. Our bill does not reflect a 4th free night, so I intend to call the resort. One thing that I was not told is that at the time of check in they let you know that they need to take $200 per day for incidentals on top of the regular bill. Make sure you call your credit card company to let them know that this transaction is coming up. Our card had a security alert on it and it added 20 minutes to our check in. (not the resorts fault). I wish we rented a car!!! Becasue we had a very large breakfast everyday, we chose to have another meal around 3 or 4 everyday. It seemed as though we lived in our bathing suits and for this reason, we chose casual resort restaurants. We got a bit sick of $15 cheeseburgers and $16 salads. One day we took the ferry to Palamino Island. It is absolutely beautiful. My husband ordered two drinks. The waitress on the beach brought them to us (not used to that kind of service...but very nice) \"$24\" she said. I have worked as a waitress all through college and I have worked for an airline for 14 years. Currently, I am in the Marketing field.....$24!!! Are you kidding. Two drinks in 8 oz plastic cups $24? If we had a car we could have gone to a grocery store and stocked up on snacks and bottled water etc, and we could have made use of the narrow galley kitchen in our unit. We asked about a shuttle from the hotel to the grocery store, and we were told that they did not offer that, but they could call a cab for us. The cab is $50 for a 5 mile round trip. By having a car we could have explored some of the authentic restaurants in Puerto Rico, and saved the $75 round trip per person for transfers to and from the airport which is an hour ride. We met some folks who travel here every year and they told us that is it $129 for a car for a week. Believe it or not we may come back, but we will be very specific about the room.

We were looking for easy access (direct flight and not too long drive), beach/swimmings with some other variety of interest points, so PR seemed perfect, with rainforest, Old San Juan, easy access, US dollar, English, etc...Overall, very nice resort. Agree with past reviewers that it is not 4+star, so as long as you don't expect that, it's ok. Grounds are gorgeous (Las Casitas and El Conquistador), big and ocean view always right there. Fun walking around after dinners, always something going on. Las Casitas: off to rocky start...when we arrived, there was water all throughout hallway to bedroom (1 bedroom villa, all ceramic tile so easy to dry), there was no rollaway bed that we were promised, and there were no blankets or sheets for sleeper sofa (which the kids ended up sharing all week b/c on day 3 when a rollaway finally became available, we were told (for the first time) that it was $45/DAY. On second day we finally got blankets for pull out, and kids could sleep together, so it was ok, though they preferred a rollaway for one since 1 boy/1 girl are getting a little old to sleep together, but they were fine even though it wasn't comfortable (bar poking the back). First dinner was at Buones Vista (sp) at El Con by big pool - food was mediocre and expensive: $70 for 2 beers, 2 cokes, 2 individual plain pizzas, 1 salad and 1 quesadilla. Shrimp on salad was not freshest. Back to Las Casitas: ocean view from balcony is gorgeous, service was good after bed and water (water issue took 3 calls/3 visits to resolve). I think water park (pool, lazy river and 3 slides) should be free if you stay. When we did water park, we arrived at 2:00, no chairs (not 1), very crowded, no tubes for floating or slides. Shame to pay for that. We did not, since we had water leaking into our villa for 3 days, and on 3rd day I asked for compensation, 4 tickets to water park. Concierge pleasantly agreed, and I'm thankful for that. I've never complained like that before, but was really feeling we were paying a lot for not such great service/ameneties, so at least that gesture made me feel like they were listening. We also had a close call going to Palimano Island. We arrived at boat at 9:45, and almost didn't get on (they go every hour) and have a 150 person capacity.. Also shame to miss that and feel the hotel should be able to accomodate large numbers of guests. If they take your money and promise you a private island, then they should have the means to get you there, even if they have to have an extra ferry for the 1 or 2 most popular hours. We made it, but dozens of others didn't, and had to wait around in hot sun till 11, b/c they couldn't really go exploring or else they'd risk losing a spot on the next ferry. No good. Again, we made it, so we felt lucky. At the island, there is some decent (not great) snorkeling, was great for kids. You have to pay for evverything (a raft, snorkel (we had some so brought from home), but lots of chairs, umbrellas, beach space, etc. Very nice. Best dining by a landslide: Las Estation, right outside of resort (take a right)...EXCELLENT, fresh, cheap compared to El Con. My kids have food allergies, adn they were willing to do whatever they could (plain grilled chix breast, etc...). We went there 2x. Their monfongo was better than Passion, and the second night I just wanted grilled shrimp, so they gave me the appetizer (pinchos)-2 skewers w/side of rice/beans. The huge platter arrived with many other additions, such as tostados (I htink), avocado, fresh lime, veggies, etc...Partner had pork loin (w/rice/beans) first night and ribs (upon recommendation of table next to us) second. Also superb (and he's very picky). I had the best mojito I've ever had at this place, but second night they had no mint, so I just had a beer. Rainforst a must, though don't expect too much from the animal kingdom other than a stray snail or tiny iguana. Oh, hte huge (2 foot iguanas) on Palimano Island are amazing.

As many others stated, internet is horrible, golf cart service you can stand there for 45 minutes some nights and nobody cares... be prepared to do alot of walking. After dinner we didn't mind walking home to work off the food otherwise the carts will really frustrate you.. If you are a beach bum this place isn't for you.. You have to take a boat to a island and then your trapped there until the next ship comes back.. We had both ships break down one day and waited for 2 hours for chartered ships to help. It was a mess had the Grand Parents been with us it would of been a nightmare... We did enjoy the property, the room, the restaurants, & the waterpark so it was a good vacation but a 3 star at best...

We read all of the tripadvisor reviews so knew in advance of some of the issues: Cleanliness - the room was nice, but we had an issue with broken glass on the rug, there was mildew on the bedskirt, there was an unidentified curly hair stuck on a wash rag, bath towels had lots of stains on them, the bathtub had alot of mildew growing, the refrigerator needs updating, the phone had not been cleaned in months as I put a clorox wipe to it and cleaned it up pretty good. Location - Nice, not too far from San Juan, but I think if I would've done it all over I would have stayed in a beach front property near San Juan. Palomino was nice, but would've been easier to just walk to the beach than have to take the ferry. Room - room was nice, no luggage racks, was very noisy, could hear our neighbors almost like they were in the same room, the palm tree outside on the balcony kept making noise all night with the wind. They upgraded us to an ocean view for free, so I can't complain much. Parking at Las Casitas is free, but sometimes not so convenient. Service - Service was better than expected, we did ask for alot of things like towels and ice which they brought right away, bottled water is free, you just have to request it. We did have a hard time finding the check-in location and drove around alot, they could make that more clear for us prior to our arriving. Wish they would explain more about how things work upon checking in, like we paid for the breakfast plan, but then were surprised when they brought us a check for our first breakfast that was over $60! The waiter told us it would be cleared upon checkout, but then we didn't know if we still had to tip since there was a service charge on there. We had to call the front desk, they could not explain the service charge, but it turns out that it was not on there after all, just our additional gratuity. All of the waitstaff at restaurants were pretty good. Value - Everything is overpriced here so you should be prepared for that prior to your stay. I think our room rate was high, food and drinks were definitely absurd at most places. We ate at Ballyhoo one night, two sandwiches and 4 drinks was over $70 and not that good; Pizza place was so-so and cost about $60 for two of us, definitely upgrade to the breakfast plan as if you don't, it will be at least $30/person for continental breakfast buffet, Iguanas at Palomino Island is also pricey and you don't have a choice once you are there since no outside food or drinks are allowed on Palomino (they don't check your bags so you can sneak in some food/drinks there). Nothing is free there, not the snorkeling equipment, nothing except the chairs and umbrellas if you can snag one. Wireless internet was $15/day and we had a weak signal when we used it. Sleep Quality - We did not sleep very good as you cannot change the room temperature in the room warmer than 72 degrees and you can hear literally everything from your neighbors around you. Tips - - Definitely stop by the Walmart or grocery store in Fajardo to get drinks for your room (other than water) and snacks for any excursions you may take. - If you plan on snorkeling, buy your own set before you come as they charge $8 each for the snorkel and $8 for the fins for a half day. You can buy your own after 2 days. - Take advantage of the free water (Dasani) - Wear shoes that don't slip easy as the whole place is covered in ceramic tile and with the constant raining it is very slippery. - Bring a flashlight, lots of their lights do not work on property - Don't plan to use the infinity pool at night as it is creepy, no lights and no towels. - If you have a rental car, take advantage of the local restaurants like El Estacion and Ole Leolai. Pasion was so-so and over priced. - Pass on the Vieques trip, we ended up spending only 2 hours on Vieques, but took us over 4 hours in travel time driving and taking the ferry and was not better than Palomino and you definitely have to bring your own food & drinks as the beaches are remote and have no vendors on them. I would recommend staying here if you mainly plan to stay on property and if you are with family. It's very nice and safe, funicular and ferry was convenient although we stayed during off-season. If you are younger and not with a family I would stay at a beachfront hotel near San Juan.", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aurora, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cFantastic trip!\u201d", "Author": "BioBay2010", "ReviewID": "UR68455220", "Content": "We are a family of four with a teenager and a five year-old, so our review will be from a family perspective with younger kids. We have stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Montego Bay, Jamaica, and we remember some of the negative reviews that hotel had received. It was a nice hotel, with a Caribbean feel, and we enjoyed our stay there and will stay there again when we go back to Montego Bay. As a result, we were not deterred when we saw some negative reviews for the El Conquistador. Location: We wanted paradise and that is why we went with the El Conquistador. The location was breath taking and it was completely worth it. There were a lot of comments about the hotel rooms needing some updating, but we did not spend too much time in the hotel room. In addition, our hotel room was in great condition. If we wanted the nightlife, we would have left the kids with a babysitter and gone on a night trip to San Juan. Checking In: It was a long trip, with our flight being delayed and getting the rental car. We ended up driving up to the main building of the El Conquistador. Let's just say it was a long day and we were tired. Fortunately, John Henao was at the front desk and was helping us. He was very professional and courteous. It was people like him, who made our stay wonderful. He was able to get us in and out in no time. Miguel, one of the bell hops, got us on our way and we got lost (because I was driving). Luckily, Sergio escorted us to our room and helped us with our bags. Sergio got us some bottled water for our fridge, which was a nice touch. Jesus brought us some sheets for our sofa bed and Pablo brought us some new keys. The day got better and our trip was back on a good note. Concierge: Lillian, who works in the Manor house, is awesome! She was extremely polite and very professional. She asked us about our plans and gave us information about activities that would compliment our planned activities. She had some better maps and some additional activities that we would not have thought of. She was the type of person that I would expect at a Waldorf or a Ritz. Restaurants: If you have read other reviews, you will notice that the hotel is lacking in a local flavor restaurant. As a result, we did venture out from the property for some meals. However, we did breakfast everyday, which was part of our package. If not, if would have been around $100.00 per day, so the package definitely paid for itself (we stayed for 8 days/7 nights). We ate at the breakfast area in Las Casitas, which was never busy (bonus). Ricardo and everyone else were very friendly, and they were a nice start to our day. We went to the Cafe Bella Vista, which was on the terrace by the main pool. This was a great place for the family. Max, who works at the Manor house, recommended it, and the kids loved it out of all of the places we went to. The hostess was very nice and our waitress, Leydi, was awesome! Our kids had the Calamari, which was good (but Calizo was better). We had pizzas here and they were great. Our tab was over $100 before the tip, but I remember the food being expensive at the Ritz in Jamaica. In addition, if you go the Atlantis in the Bahamas it is expensive there. Pools/Water Park: We stayed in the Las Casitas wing, but we made it to see almost all of the pools. The pools were nice, especially with the Infinity pool in the Las Casitas wing. During different times of the day, you could always find peace at one of the pools. The water park was nice and it was the kids favorite. The water slides are fun and easy enough for kids to go on. My son did two out of the three big slides, but I did not think he was ready for the big drop slide. Even though there was a child, who was younger, that went on the slide. The water park also has an Infinity edge in part of the pool, which was a nice touch. The water park has more younger kids than older kids, but there were still teenagers and twenty-somethings at the water park during our stay. The water park is big enough for you to have your own area, if you don't want to sit by kids. However, you will still hear them if you are not listening to music. Palimino Island (private beach): The beach was awesome! My wife loved the beach area the most. We had read reviews and brought water shoes. I did not use them most of the time, but my wife and kids did not want to go into the water without them. They have plenty of activities, if you don't want to lay out and go in the water all day. They had a basketball court, with a few balls to play with (free to use). The basketball court is concrete, so you can actually dribble. However, it was a little warm for my 13 year old, so she needed to use her shoes (not a bad thing). There is a sand volleyball court and a volleyball (free to use). There is a miniature golf course, which looked like fun and was popular. There is horseback riding, jet skis, snorkeling, rafts, kayaks, and so much more. Plus, there is a casual restaurant with a bar, a shop, and another bar area. Jose at Iguanas was a really friendly. Spa: My daughter wanted to get the works done, but she was too young for the spa. As a result, my wife did not go and took one for the team. When we went to the Ritz, our daughter had been able to get spa treatments, so it was a little disappointing. However, I liked that the spa was its own stand alone building. It has a salon, fitness center, men's and women's area (which include showers, jacuzzi, steam room, and lounge area), spa area, and a tea lounge. I got two spa treatments while I was there, and they were great. The hot stone was one of the better ones, and the Golden Door treatment got out the kinks from carrying my son through the rain forest, Old San Juan, etc. Casino: I had envisioned something larger, until I saw a you tube video of someone walking by the casino. As a result, I was not let down with how small it is. However, they did have a nice assortment of games and a few tables to play at. The tables were full during the Lakers/Celtics games, and it was pretty full during this time. There is a bar in the Casino, called 21. Make sure that you get a Mojito from Keyra. She made the best Mojitos on the island. The drinks are expensive, and can run $10-$15 for non-beer drinks. However, I saw people buying $13+ drinks and leaving $1 tips. Personally, I felt like it was ridiculous that they were upset with the prices, but taking it out on the staff. My tips were more generous, and I realize that these people might have families that they need to support (in addition to themselves). Golf and Tennis: We did not play either, during our stay. Resort Fee: This hotel has a resort fee. I have encountered this before in other places that I have stayed, especially in Vegas, so I was not surprised. When you look at it per day, it is not that bad. Parking: I have seen a lot of complaints on having to pay for parking. I have stayed downtown Salt Lake City, and I had to pay for parking at the hotel that I stayed at\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Downtown Chicago, San Francisco, etc. all charge for parking, so I do not see why it is a surprise for a resort to charge for parking. However, the Las Casitas area you do not have to pay for parking, so keep that in mind when booking your room. You will not be able to park if you do not stay there, because the guard would not let you in. Getting around: We rented a car, because we felt that it would be the most efficient use of our time. We wanted to experience Puerto Rico without being herded like cattle. It was well worth it. Overall: Our stay was great and we would definitely stay here again in the future. I think that it was worth the money and it was a great time. We went to Walmart for groceries for our room and that helped cut down some of the expenses. Cons: The room keys were a problem for my family, in the Las Casitas section. The room keys can get demagnetized, which happened to my wife. Once she found out she no longer had that problem. The major problem was the room key would still work, but the entry key to get to the room might change. This happened when a family moved in the suite above ours, but we were not aware that this could happen. We got back from Old San Juan, on our last night, and we were not able to get to our room door. As a result, I called the Manor house to get some new keys. They said someone would be there with three new keys. It is past 11 pm and our 5 year old is melting down from the long day. We called back in 13 minutes and they said they had sent someone. I could have walked to the manor house in less time, but I was told that someone was coming so I stayed with my family. After 20 minutes had passed, I called the Manor house again and no one answered, so we got transferred to the main operator and they got security to us. In all we waited 30 minutes with my son crying for part of that time, but the person never made it in the 30 minutes with the 3 keys. Hector was nice enough to open the door for us, and mentioned not to close the door that leads to both of the rooms. However, we had left it open when we left, so the other family must have closed it. The funny thing is our keys worked on our room doors. Now if Lillian had been in town, I know that this would have been resolved sooner. Also, if they said that the bell hops were at the main hotel or helping someone else, I would have walked down to the Manor house. We might have made it more difficult for housekeeping (not on purpose), when we closed the door to the suites. This speed bump was minor and our trip was fantastic, so this does not take away any stars from the hotel.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "AZ", "Title": "\u201cIf Service isn't important to you - Las Casitas is the place for YOU!\u201d", "Author": "shupemom", "ReviewID": "UR68243363", "Content": "We just returned from our family vacation at Las Casitas resort. I debated about posting my review while still there and things were fresh in my mind but then I decided to wait a week to see if my feelings had changed. I had read the numerous reviews on this site and we still decided on this property. I must say that I cannot in all good conscience rate this property a 4 or 5 and my husband who is extremly easy going, agreed. The grounds and surrounding area were breathtaking. The photos on the website do not even do the property any justice. I will cut to the chase, and state I rated this property a 3 because I was severely disappointed with the way we were made to feel during our stay. Having visited the stunning 5 star resorts in Maui, the Bahamas, Cancun, Aruba and here in the Phoenix metro-area - service is extremely important to us. I will typically book concierge level rooms since I appreciate the extra personal touch. Having spent $600+ per night for a 2 bedroom/2 bath casita with an ocean view - you would think that the service would translate. The staff at Las Casitas had an uncaring attitude, almost to the point whenever we called or went to the manor house for assistance - the staff members acted like we interrupted their break time. * We used the Hotel airport transfer for $74 per person. We had to carry and load our own bags - which should have given me a glimpse of what kind of service (or lack thereof) we were in for. * We checked in and found that the casita had no hot water. I contacted housekeeping and concierge 3 times regarding the problem and in all 3 instances they said they were going to send someone right over. Finally, when my kids were screaming from the showers, the 4th phone call the associate tried to direct me to where the switch was in the kitchen to activate the water heater. After further searching we were able to find it - and no one assisted. Further, for that kind of price - why wasn't the water heater switched on prior to our arrival? * When we checked in, housekeeping failed to place wash towels in the room. Numerous requests were made during morning and turn down services for 4 days - no wash towels. The evening before we were scheduled to check-out, wash towels finally appeared. * WiFi - non-existent in the casita. The concierge associate actually asked me to move my laptop around the perimeter of the casita, that the wifi was fine and it had to be my laptop. I had visions of standing on my patio, on one foot and holding my laptop in the air to try to receive a signal. NOT! Again, no one came to trouble shoot or assist. * Golf - Cart service to the El Conquistador next door was a challenge. Which, by the way is where all the restaurants are. My Mother, who does not walk very good - came with us and walking around this resort the first day almost made me check out and go elsewhere. The cart sometimes would take us to the front door and othertimes dropped us up 1 hill to walk the rest of the way. * The Water Park - fun - but cost prohibitive for most. $19.95 per person per day, no discount for staying at the resort -- shame on you for charging that for hotel guests. * Concierge - asking them for dinner reservations off property one evening was a lesson in futility. Concierge desks I am accustomed to have a large book with restaurant menus. Not at Las Casitas Manor House. Actually the associate looked at me like I was nuts when I asked. * Restaurants were OK. I am not going to complain about the prices, because I was on vacation.Stingray had an amazing menu and food was delicious. * Fajardo - the resort is located 1 hour from the airport, on the north eastern tip of the island. In my opinion it is way too far from anything. I certainly like places that are not anywhere multiple high-rise beach resorts USA, but this bordered on the ridiculous. * The private island was nice, my kids rented jet skis and had a blast. * The infinity pool was the place we hung out most days, but again - they claimed they had pool service that was non-existent. We arrived and our first day at the pool was Sunday. There was pool service that day but after that, we didn't see anyone until Thursday - the day before we checked out. If we wanted anything we had to go get it ourselves and then again, we were interrupting. These things might be trivial to some, but this hopefully paints a picture that the overall service at this beautiful property was very poor. I hope someone in Management reads reviews on trip advisor and makes a major overhaul. Originally, we were going to stay at the Ritz Carlton - but I found Las Casitas and thought the water slides, private beach and more room to move around in the casita was all a bonus.

The property is beautiful, with lush landscapes, gorgeous pools. My main issue with this resort is that it is billed as a Waldorf Astoria property but is not at the standard of their other properties, especially for the cost. Upon arrival we were unceremoniously dropped at our doorstep with no official tour or introduction to the very large property by our \"personal butler\". The staff had not bothered to flip the switch on the water heater, so for the first night we had cold water only until we figured this out. This casita (villa) had no slippers or robes as adveritsed. Upon calling the service desk, we were told that the resort was \"in the process of upgrading to a Waldorf Astoria property\", so not all the units had all amenities yet. They did manage to find us some robes and slippers later that evening. The front desk had initially told us we were being taken to a room with 2 double beds, but when we arrived there was a sofabed and a king, so the second day, they did make an effort to accomodate us and found us a room with 2 double beds and we moved. This was after another incident in which we called and complained because housekeeping left a diaper on the nighttable -- and no it was not ours. The second villa was clearly an upgraded/more newly renovated unit, but still no robes. These rooms were nothing spectacular either. The 3rd morning I woke up with one bite, the next day we both woke up with several bed bug bites, despite the fact that the room seemed basically clean. The resort restaurants are very expensive ($10 hot dog, $15 burger). You should take a cab to town and eat at the local restaurants which are very good. Also, ask the cab drivers for rates on discounted Bio Bay, Rainforest and Old San Juan tours, depending on the size of your group, you can save up to half off the hotel's rates.

I admit that, having read some of the reviews before going, I was a bit worried, but I'm happy to say that we had a fantastic time in a beautiful resort. Some points for those scheduled to/considering a visit: - Do take advantage of any package that includes breakfast, as the run-of-the mill continental will run at least $25/pp. - We rented a car for a week but are unsure if it was financially advantageous. It was nice to have the convenience (off-site dinners, driving to the Port Authority to take a ferry to Vieques), though if you're trying to save, I suspect the hotel could have arranged ad hoc trips (everything is within 10 minutes). - We did not explore Old San Juan or the Rainforest, though we heard the latter was worth the trip (in particular, the waterfalls and canopy make for outstanding photos/swimming). - Go in with eyes open: obvioulsy everything on the resort is more expensive (you won't find a watered-down pina colada under $13), so you can either buy food/alcohol and keep it in your room, go off-site for your meals, or relax and enjoy the resort's restaurants. We ate at three of the restaurants - The Strip House (which isn't cheap, but has outstanding cuts), Stingray (again, not cheap, but the variety and quality is top notch and the atmosphere - wait for a seat outside - is fantastic), and Blossoms (we ate at the sushi bar here - not the best, but I've read that the seafood is some of the freshest anywhere). - We got the sense from the concierge that there are certain off-site restaurants that get pushed more than others. We tried Passion our first night - fine (the mofango was very good), but atmosphere ho-hum. If you have just one night, definitely go to Ole Leilolai - a wonderful tapas restaurant just 5 minutes from the resort with great staff and outdoor deck. Menu is creative and diverse - something for everyone. - Palomino Beach is fantastic - tons of chairs/shade, so it shouldn't be too hard to find an open spot. Food at the nearby bar is fine... ~$25 for a bucket of (5) beers which you can bring back to your chairs. I'm VERY happy I listened to posters recommending bringing water shoes - the ocean floor is all coral. Also, snorkeling here is worth ~an hour, though be careful around the reefs, as it can be sharp. - The hotel arranges scuba/snorkel trips every day (not sure why there wasn't more mention of it in the tour books?) - fantastic and well-run operation. We lucked out and a large group had chartered a boat to go out to Culebra for a full day - a destination and duration not usually offered. As they were looking to fill a few remaining seats, we grabbed them. WELL worth the money and full day trip, though I\"m sure any of the trips are great. - Las Casitas offers complimentary water. We called to ask for some to be brougt to our room, and they brought 8 bottles. We should have asked earlier! - Infinity Pool is amazing. Could have easily spent days here. - Golden Door Spa was fine, but a mani/pedi ran $130+ (a price I have no problem paying if the experience is worth it, but I found everything from the service to the environment lackluster). - Nights are quiet, but if the casino isn't your thing, you can always order banana splits to go, rent a DVD from the front desk office, and relax in one's room. - Vieques is fun for a day trip (just $2 ferry to the island and back) - as is Culebra, I suspect - but go for the beaches, as you won't find any town centers or shops. Vans on the island are frequent and cheap (~$6 to get from one end of the island to the other).

Our casita was disappointing: the beds were small (double, not queen) and in need of replacement due to sagging, the bathroom was a bit tired, the TV old and erratic, and the AC intermittent (subsequently repaired by AC contractor). Sound proofing between rooms was very bad--always heard doors in unit next to us slamming. It should be noted that the staff is very friendly and the grounds are well maintained and inviting. The infinity pool is everything you might hope for! The property is built into a steep hillside, so be prepared for a lot of up and down. We were fine with that but if you are not in shape, watch out. Breakfast was served at one of the 2 pools and it was delightful, albeit simple. Service was barely OK. We were on a breakfast meal plan. If you are not, be prepared to spend $20+ for your continental breakfast. We did not have dinner at the property, but we did have cocktails. The setting for the bar was out of this world. So were the prices: The tangerine mohito including tax and manadatory tip was about $20; the Margarita made with premium tequila was about $30. The drinks were not large. You will need 2 drinks to get a buzz. Ouch! While the staff was friendly, the service was unreliable. Be prepared to submit your request for special assistance 2 or more times. We sought a rollaway or air mattress for teenage child. Had to ask 3 times before they got it right. The first time the air mattress had a slow leak. Child slept on the hard floor that night. Golden Door Spa facility on the grounds is magnificent. First class! Clearly a highlight. Exclusive Palomino Island beach area (accessible only by hotel boat) is very attractive but the beach is more for sunning and wading, not swimming or riding surf. Lunch at the beach cafe was fine: beer was cold, sandwiches and fare perfectly acceptable. Hotel water park with separate admission was small, but very enjoyable even for older kids and adults. Families with younger kids or tweens will love it.- Did not play golf but the course looked well maintained. Bottom line: Rooms need a real face lift if they are to play in the big leagues.

However, once we got there a rude lady at front desk told us once she already checked us in that \"since we arrived before check in we would be charges for the night before\" which was not the information provided previously once booking the trip. At first we where given a room with NO Balcony even though they said we would have one and the sheets felt like we slept on sand paper from the lint. Once we went to front desk they were nice to accommodate a nicer room in the Marina which faced the water and right next to the pool, but the walk to it was over 15 minutes. We traveled there for a wedding with over 150 guests. Half if not most found little bed bug bites on them which front desk told us were Mosquito bites, right! Upon carful reviewed once we arrived back home we found out that they where bed bug bites. We called back to see if they would provide any help and they told us that we would need to be seen by the doctor in the hotel, well HELLO we tried but were turned away when we were there. When confronting the front desk we where not even given any repellants just told to go buy it on our own and go on about our day. Once we where checking out we where not informed that the check out was at 11 A.M. so when I got the bell hop at 10 A.M. they arrived almost an hour later and we were forced to pay $65 extra for \"late check out\". If they moved a little faster maybe I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to pay daily $20 for the service that was not needed. Speaking of charges lets talk about $3 daily charge for housekeeping. The lady came at 5 P.M. almost at he end of the end of the day and not only do they \"save\" on water by not changing sheets but they also do not provide clean towels until I had to beg for them to be brought to out room.

We have previously stayed at the many nice hotels including, The reef-atlantis, Ritz St. Thomas, Marriott Grand caymen, Moon palace cancun, Westin Cabo. Disney Cruise and this was one of the better quality trips we have taken. The hotel was extremely nice with wonderful views from our room and the infiniti pool is wonderful. The casual dining spots in the Casitas are very relaxing for breakfast and lunch, and much nicer than the grand buffet at the main hotel. Our kids enjoyed the water park for 2 of our days and we went to palamino island for one of our days. We all enjoyed both of these activities and the beack on the island is wonderful. They have a basketball court on the island along with horseback, and many watersports. Our kids, 2 boys aged 10 and 12, enjoyed the pingpong at the main pool, while my wife and I enjoyed drinks at the pool bar overlooking the sea below. We took a side trip one day to do the zip lining at Marchesa forest which was an easier course than the El Yungue zip line and it was a great family activity. The kids did very well with this and had no worries. I was afraid the kids might have been afraid of the more challenging El Yungue, But considering how easily they did the course in Marchesa, we probably would have done just as well on the El Yungue Zip line. Another side trip we took was to the Hacienda Carabali ranch were we all rode 4 wheelers. It was a great trip. We took the 2 hour tour which takes you up into the mountains and our guide stopped to let us swim in a river up in the rain forest. They also offer horseback riding and they have a nice restaurant-bar. Back to the hotel, We enjoy the restaurants contrary to some other reviewers. Stingrays in the marina offer very fresh fish every nignt as well as tradition favorites. The Italian restaurant was very good one evening, and as I stated we really liked the breakfast offered in the casitas village. The kids loved the cookies at the store at the top of of the funicular and we also liked the casual food at the water park. One day I went golfing with the boys and the course was excellent. While we golfed, my wife went to the spa and she had a wonderful day. We had dinner at 2 outside restaurants and both were wonderful. The first was called El Varadero which is in the marina area in fajardo which is only about one mile from the main gate. When you drive into Fajardo, the marina is on the left. As you enter the marina there is a gate that you will come to and you must just tell the gaurd you are going to the restaurant and they will let you through. We had Breakfast here and dinner one evening which was extremely good. It is also waterside dining and offers a great atmosphere. There number is [--] We also had dinner at La Parrilla which is in the Kiosks in Luguillo. The Kiosks don't look like much in appearances, but La Parilla was very nice inside and the food was the best. My wife and I both had traditional Puerto Rican dishes, while the kids split a 3 pound lobster. It was a great experience. They let the kids pick there own live lobster from a tank and it was delicious. Lastly, As you can tell from all of our side trips, we rented a car which I highly recommend. It was an easy drive from the airport and then you have it available to enyoy some of the activities that Puerto Rico has to offer.

When researching Puerto Rico, we initially ruled out Las Casitas due to the travel time required to get to the beach. However, after looking at many other properties, our travel agent suggested we take another look here and we are thrilled that we did! Rooms: Las Casita are definitely they way to go versus hotel rooms at El Con. The hotel was crowded during our stay. The Casitas were always quiet and calm in comparison. Best of both worlds from my perspective. We stayed in a two bedroom Casita which was huge, comfortable and always immaculately clean. We were in the North Village a few steps away from the Casitas Caf\u00c3\u00a9 and one of the Casitas pools. My overall impression of the Casitas from the outside was that the South Village appeared newer. I did not see the inside of a South Village Casita, but they appeared to have some newer fixtures and newer front doors. Our Casita was, according to the front desk, refurbished within the last month. The kitchen/living room area had new looking furniture, granite counters, and stainless steel appliances giving it a great look. The cabinets appeared not to be new, but recently painted. The bathrooms were all clean, but the fixtures, such as the tub and sink looked older. Also the closet and cabinet doors throughout the casita were much older. So, while our Casita was lovely, it seems to me that the renovations were not as thorough as they should have been. This makes me wonder what the Casitas that have not yet been refurbished must look like. We enjoyed the North Village because it was an easy walk over to the hotel as well as the tennis courts/golf course and the Golden Door Spa area. We walked all around both the North and South Casitas and found that while you can walk to the hotel from the South Casitas, there are a lot of steps involved. Our refrigerator was stocked with water bottles each day. I wish I had known that before I dragged a heavy 24 bottle case of water in from the Supermarket! Transportation: We did not rent a car in Puerto Rico, but we went armed with the knowledge that if we needed to, we could rent one on property. We arranged for private transportation to and from the airport through our travel agent. I believe that the hotel offers a shared shuttle as well, but I think we actually paid a little less on our own. The private transfer was especially nice because we were able to stop at the supermarket on the way in so that we could stock up on breakfast foods and drinks. I assumed, based on prior reviews, that we would rent a little car just to leave the property for dinner once we got settled in, but we never felt the need. Beach/pools: For us, this was an extremely active vacation due to the travel time involved in getting to the beach. I really expected to go to the beach only once or twice, but we went almost every day. We even all enjoyed the boat ride over to Palomino Island. We loved the water sports at the beach (banana boat rides, kayaks etc). Keep in mind that EVERYTHING is ala-carte....even rafts at the beach, so it can get expensive. Water shoes are a MUST (even crocs do the trick) because there is a LOT of coral right off the beach. As long as your feet are protected, the ocean is awesome\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6warm and Caribbean blue with almost non-existent surf. We ended each day with an early evening swim in the Casitas pools which are not open to the El Con guests and therefore very private and relaxing. In the Casitas Villages, there is always plenty of fresh, cold water at each pool and lots of towels. They even brought around complementary fresh fruit-kabobs on hot afternoons. We did not use the main pools at the hotel or the water park \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our kids preferred the beach. Food: As mentioned by almost all the TA posts, the food is expensive. But, we found it all to be good. This is the Caribbean and my experience is that most resort food in the Caribbean is expensive. People always seem surprised by this...we just expect it. We ate at three of the four \"upscale\" restaurants on the property. Blossoms, which is a hibachi/Chinese restaurant, had good food and generous portions. It was extremely expensive and no different than eating in a hibachi restaurant at home. My kids loved it, but I could have skipped that one. We also ate at the Strip House (very good steak house) and Stingrays (excellent seafood). I liked Stingrays because it is located at the marina and we were able to eat outside and enjoy the beautiful Caribbean night. Blossoms, The Strip House and Piccolo (Italian...we cancelled our reservation) were all inside the main hotel. We also ate at a few of the more casual bar/restaurants sprinkled throughout the property. Their menu's were more limited, but always tasty (and in most cases, more readily accommodating to a picky 8 year old). They, too, tend to be on the expensive side but not nearly as much as the Big Four upscale restaurants. Plus, they are almost all outdoor cafe type places which is my vacation preference. My biggest criticism of the food would have to be the lack of local flavor. Most menus were very similar to those found in the continental US. I would have like to see some more local and/or general Caribbean options as well. Service: We found the service to be wonderful. Our butler checked in with us every day and provided us with a lot of helpful information. With very few exceptions, the staff was friendly, helpful and extremely accommodating everywhere we went on the property. Resort as a whole: This place is beyond beautiful. It is almost impossible not to be awed by your surroundings. The reason that I did not give this resort 5 starts (although I would have given it 4.5 if I could) is that there are a number of little things that needed attention. Most of them are easily fixed items. For example, our first night at the resort, I had to call maintenance and security about 5 times to fix little things such as our front door lock malfunctioning, lack of a previously requested roll a way bed and a safe that malfunctioned with our belongings in it. After that, there always seemed to be something just slightly off such as the way we had to space our showers to ensure that we all had hot water or the set of bi-fold closet doors that was constantly falling off track . None of these issues were insurmountable, but a true five star property would not have these issues. The Bottom Line: We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Las Casitas and I would recommend it whole-heartedly to anyone considering Puerto Rico as a vacation destination. If we return to Puerto Rico, we will definitely stay here again!", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Ma", "Title": "\u201cBreathtaking Views and Pool.

Puerto Rico met our criteria: non-stop flight, guaranteed warm weather, and easy immigration. After reading about Las Casitas on Trip Advisor, I booked through the Waldorf website, instead of other vacation web engines. Through the Waldorf site, I was able to secure exactly what type of room and location I wanted . Las Casitas is a smaller, newer accomodation attached to the very large Conquistador Resort. So glad I took the advice of TA'ers. And I found that all the reviews were spot-on. We flew into San Juan and took the hotel motorcoach I had booked through the concierge. The motorcoach cost $70 dollars for the two of us. We did not rent a car for this short trip. The motorcoach was pleasant. The driver was good. It takes about 45-60 minutes from the airport to the hotel. Very easy check-in at Las Casitas. The service was excellent throughout our 3 and 1/2 day stay. Little things were a miss in our condo: a faucet handle off, problems with on of the Tv's, no robes....and they were all quickly remedied. Las Casitas gives you a \"butler\", and he called us every day, leaving his personal cell phone. I never used him, but went through the conceirge instead because it was just more convenient for me to press a button on the house phone then to figure out how to call the butler. If you are at the Casitas, one has access to everything at the resort, plus everything at the Conquistador. Those staying at Conquistador cannot use Casitas facilities. Las Casitas has a gorgeous infinity pool. The views from my condo balcony and the pool hinted of stays I've had in the Greek Islands. Just breathtaking. There is a small lunch place attached to the infinity pool area, with a limited menu. There is a separate breakfast cafe, with a buffet offered each morning. In short, here are the highlights and caveats: 1. Condos are very clean, up to date, and we had a to die-for ocean view. 2. Service at Las Casitas was excellent, from the concierge, to each server 3. The pools, grounds, equipment were well mantained. 4. The cliffside pool was gorgeous. But keep in mind: 1. To get to the beach one must: walk to Conquistador or take golf cart (about 5 minutes), Take elevator down part of cliff to funicular (another 10 minutes). Wait at funicular and take this down to marina.(15 minutes). Wait for hydro-ferry, get on, and ride 15-20 minutes across water to hotel-owned island. Very small beach. Funky and fun. But teeny. Because it took so long to get over to the island beach, during holiday season, my daughter and I only went over there once. Getting from our condo to the beach took us an hour. The ferry runs on the hour, so if you miss it, you have to wait 60 minutes for the next ride out to the island. It is just tedious. It's an ok beach, but if you are a \"beach person\"--this may not be the spot for you. 2. The tab can add up. Because it's an island, and it's a resort, food and drink are pricey. 3. My daughter and I are active and fit, and were trying to take stairs any time we could. But the hotel decided not to finish stairs going from the Marina up the cliff . So, there was really no way to circumvent the long holiday lines at the funicular or elevator. Sometimes, if the funicular is down, the hotel runs buses from the boat at the marina up the hills to the main hotel. Just not while we were there. ** There is a fantastic water park, which we didn't use, but people really raved about it. The dinner choices are broadbased. We ate at the Sushi bar twice and at the Marina twice. We were not interested in the steakhouse or the italian restaurants, which were the other dinner options. *** We had a great time. We don't gamble, so didn't go to the casino. We also didn't use the Golden Door Spa, ...just chilled on our own, read, slept, swam. The Marina area is very pretty and wonderful at night. My only recommendations to the hotel would be to eventually upgrade the bathrooms. They are pretty, good shower water pressure, but the tiles and bathtub is starting to look dated. They should offer authentic Puerto Rican food options at lunch and dinner. There is a cafe inside the Conquistador that has some local food offers. And the Marina offers a high end seafood restaurant with flavorful Carribean accents, but no simple PR food. Last,management needs to have a serious sit-down & look over how to offer a variety of options to transport guests to & from the beach and marina. Over half of the group waiting to get to the beach with me were fedup with the long wait at the funicular and especially at the boat dock. Sitting around with disgruntled vacationers is not my idea of a vacation. Yes, I recommend Las Casitas very much. Go for the sun, the pool, and the serene views of the Carribean.

A couple things that we did made this one of the nicest vacation memories I can think of. First off, rent a car in san juan its MANDATORY! This allows you to leave the resort which is crucial because resort food is triple priced. You can easily make trips to Wal_Mart the Liquor store or local fast food or...even BK or Churches chicken LOL. I will say that the casitas side is a bit nicer and more secluded than the el conquistador (the hotel) side. On the casitas side the infinity pools are spectacular and on the late nights we were the only ones there. We went across to palamino island one of the days and it was nice we opted to do a kayak and we went about 100 yards off the coast and found a small island that was no more than 1/2 acre. The best thing we did was renting a car and also bring a fodor's travelers book. From the book we learned about a couple of cultural options that they would never tell you about on the resort. LIke the town of Loiza that is known for its African ancestry we went there and took pics in the town square. We also drove to the rain forest which was no more than 15 minutes away, luquillo beach, we went to san jaun one night as well. One of the reasons I would really recommend driving is because it allows you to see so much more it greatly expands your food options and it allows you to be in charge of your destiny a bit more (again liquor store walmart gorcery store and fast food are less than 10 min drive). We talked to people who lived there about their favorite places to eat which is the SECOND best thing we ever did. Never got a bad recommendation. The best place was called Estrella del Norte. I had some conch with garlic and my lad had the grilled lobster which was $25 compared to the $50+ at the resort! The lady at the souviner shop recommended it and wrote down the spelling we did the rest its located about 2 miles from the resort and it was soooo good and about a 1/3 of the price of the resort food. When we went to go get directions from concierge it turns out that restaurant is one of his favorites and is owned by his mother in law. We also ate a a GREAT place called La Parilla near luquillo beach; the hot sauce was so good we had to buy a bottle and wished we would have gotten two! All in all I would recommend this place to familes and couples who are willing to travel to get to the best of what PR has to offer.

It is in some spots. My recommendation is to take a right on the beach when you exit the dock. It is not worth walking to far away from the beach that you see. The water is the deepest and coral free right there. If you chair is not lining up to hit the sun correctly, just turn it. No need to bring towels on this trip, they have them at all the pools and at the beach.

I booked a guest room for 249.00 a night with the 4th night free. I was quite surprised to find the guest room so large and comfortable and best of all it had a spectatular view of the ocean. we had our own balcony. I believe the only difference with the one bedroom is that it has a kitchen with refrigerator and microwave. We stayed for a week and ate out everyday so we didnt feel the need for a kitchen. The villas are very quiet and peaceful...and i found out later that we picked the perfect time of season to visit. I never saw anyone in the pools, we had to pool to ourselves at all times of the night. The villa room was very clean and was cleaned and restocked everyday to perfection. The Butler???who??only met him once when he helped us with bags to our room. But honestly...we didnt need him. We are not used to being waited on hand and foot..if we need something we get it. when we arrived in PR it was very confusing to find a taxi or a shuttle..and for the prices they wanted Im glad we didnt. We ended up finding a shuttle to enterprise, rented a car for 20.00 a day and off we went. Its about a 25 mile drive and enterprise gave us great directions to get there.. we went straight to the el conquistor gate and the man told us where to go in las casistas to check in. there was no confusion and quite easy check in at the manor house. we never had to wait for transportation to get to el conquistor, because we loved to walk there. we must of went there about 2 times a day. we went to the casino, to the gift shops, to blossoms restaurant, stingrays and several of the bars. Yes all the restaurants are quite expensive so spread out your visits to local spots. We saved money by doing tours on our own like to El Yunque and Old San Juan. Palamino Island was beautiful. Ferry did not take forever, came every 30 min and maybe took 15 to get to the island.. PLEASE BRING WATER SHOES. the beach floor is all rocks,,you cant avoid them. it will make your experience better if you wear them. I heard this and didnt listen so of course couple of steps in the water and I was hurting. So i was lucky to find some on the island at the local gift shop but for 20.00 a pair. went jetsking for 70.00 for 1/2 hr, but because no one was out there and it was such a slow season,,,the guy let me stay out for a while longer. Also went snokeling for 15.00 rented the whole gear and saw some great coral reefs and fish. LOCAL Restaurants to visit..El Pasion...right down the road from the hotel, Metropol..at the intersection, and the locals in El Yunque. Also met several couples and lots of families with kids that were staying at El Conquistor...everyone had happy faces...they loved the water park and all the pools..and they all said they had great rooms..So if you dont care too much about privacy you can save some money and stay over there..Overall the resort is so beautiful you cant go wrong. We are already looking forward to another trip next year. One last thing...because its off season in July...make sure you at least stay a full weekend because none of the local spots seem to be open M-W, the party starts no earlier than Thursdays. And i didnt have to pay for parking...not sure why somepeople say that. maybe at el conquistor.", "Date": "September 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFantastic stay at Las Casitas!\u201d", "Author": "northerner1", "ReviewID": "UR37480265", "Content": "We had a wonderful five night stay at Las Casitas.

This hotel is affiliated with El Conquistador and casita guests are allowed all their hotel amenities but cannot use casita facilities. Pros: The Room- Absolutely beautiful panaromic views from the large balcony made this trip for me. Uniquely positioned on a cliff the winds are cooling and the view is amazing. The Infinity Pool- For Casita guests only this pool is beautiully situated on the cliff with amazing views and very relaxing. The Coqi Water Park- For a fee it is a very lively pool area with water slides and provided fun for teenagers and relaxing area for parents. The Strip House Steak House- High end restaurant, had a great chateaubriand for two Cons: The Service- I must say hotel advertises a butler to take care of your needs, but this person is non-existent. Drink Prices- Never mind paying higher prices for food or drink on vacation, however being served a beer in a 6 ounce plastice cup for $5.50 was a bit much. Not to mention $20.00 for a not so great martini. Anything El Conquistador- I felt the pools were inferior to Las Casitas, the Casino was unexciting, the restaurants were bland and boring. Palomino Island- Very Very disappointed in their beach island. Very rocky water, rocky sand, very uninspiring. Never went back after first day. We did two excursions: One to Rain Forest through hotel tour was terrific and had a great tour guide. Used East Island Excursions to take a catamaran out to Cuelbra.

We had a car and drove in from San Juan -- I thought it an easy, although rather slow drive. When we arrived, there is no clear place to go for check-in -- also, there was no place to park. So we sort of asked around and found out how to check in at the Casitas \"Manor House.\" Very unprofessional and lackadaisical staff there. A good deal of the information they provided was untrue or incorrect. Upon entering our room (at 5 pm), we discovered that it was only partially cleaned. Previous guests' food sitting on the kitchen counters; beds not made up, sand all through the living room. We decided to go to dinner and give them a chance to clean it. We stayed at one of the expensive 2 bedroom Casitas, with a beautiful ocean view -- but as son said \"There was not a remotely comfortable piece of furniture in the whole place.\" Plastic (very small) sofa to stick to; one rattan chair that poked you; beds that were hard and uninviting. Even though we were only party of 3, we could not sit together in the living room due to the sparse furnishings. Balcony had furniture that was torture to sit on. Nothing 5 star in the design, decor, or furnishings here. Old fat tube TV's that were placed so far across the room with no furniture near, you could barely see them to enjoy a movie or TV show -- lousy picture too. There was no internet service available anywhere. They kept telling us that they were repairing the in-room wireless, but that never happened. Our aircard did not work in the room, and in the business center the internet did not work either. Other reviewers here noted the same -- seems they don't really have any kind of service that works much. My husband is total techie, and he couldn't make anything happen either. We found nearly everything inconvenient. To get to Palomino Island beach, it was like a 45 minute to one hour ordeal. We had to wait for a golf cart to take us to the main hotel. They told us \"Whenever you need a ride, just give us a call and we will get a golf cart right away!\" Yea, right! Generally, a 15 minute wait in the sweltering heat and if we called and someone else was more aggressive, they just took your place on the golf cart and you wait for the next. (I will say that all the golf cart drivers were friendly -- we always tipped at least $3 for the short ride. I did not see anyone else tipping them.) After they drop you at the main hotel, you have to slog past the huge long line of tourists constantly waiting to check in. I never saw such long lines in a 5 star hotel. The lobby is a low-ceilinged, dark, depressing place. You have to wend your way past all the shops, then wait in line for an elevator to take you down the cliff. Then, you have to walk a long way past all their other shops. Then wait in line for the funicular to take you the rest of the way down the cliff. You get off the funicular, then get to wait in another line until they decide to let you on the boat that takes you to the island beach. Whew . . . carrying all our stuff in 100 degree heat and waiting in all those lines -- no fun. We only did it once. Their \"fitness center\" is in the lower shops area. What a joke! It looked like a couple treadmills sitting in someone's garage. Unbelievable -- 5 star??? Seriously, a couple windowless rooms with no towels or amenities -- not even any kind of decent equipment. I checked it out, but obviously did not bother to stop in for my workout. The beach was underwhelming. Tons of icky weeds washed up on the shore and in the water. I was grateful for my water shoes. The rest was a rocky dead coral reef. We wanted to get jet skis, have banana boat rides, etc. but even though the island is open daily until 5:30 pm, they took all the jet skis and stuff away by 2 pm, so no chance to do any water activities. It was a big bore. Housekeeping was an on-going ordeal. The first day our bulter \"Carlos\" left us a voicemail \"Hello, just call if you need anything.\" We never saw or heard from him again. Calling did nothing. We gave our maids $20 - $25 tips daily in hopes of getting something we requested or needed -- all in vain. Requests for hand towels, wash clothes, bath mats were routinely ignored by the maids, conceirge, Manor House staff, etc. Yes, we did our own dishes, and straightened our own rooms. I noted that they recycled the shampoo and lotion bottles -- they had little paper closures on them and they were always broken, so someone used them before me. Ick. 5 star -- Waldorf Astoria should pull their name from this place Both my husband and I went to the Golden Door spa. I have been to other Golden Door properties and surprise -- this one was least impressive! The girl at reception ignored me for over 15 minutes as I patiently waited to book five hundred dollars of treatments. She was taking phone calls instead -- one of my pet peeves to handle the phones and ignore folks standing in front of you. The fitness center in the spa was small, but nice -- had everything you need for a good workout in a nice atmosphere. I had a massage/body scrub, which was okay, but the masseuse sniffed really loud the entire way through. I wanted to sit up and yell \"Take a break and blow your nose!\" Not very relaxing. Husband and son went to the driving range one day -- no particular complaints. Husband said they had great drivers for use. (I am not a golfer, so I forgot what kind he said they were.) Pools at the property were nice, especially the infinity pool, but no towels. Again, they seem to have service problems everywhere. No one was picking up the used towels, or replenishing the supply of fresh towels. So instead of feeling relaxed, we just were constantly feeling irritated. Food was very expensive and very mundane at most of the restaurants and bars. However, we had a good meal at the Steak House and good service. I think it cost around $400 for 3 of us -- no drinks, one moderately price bottle of wine. We had a dinner at the StingRay Cafe which was not great. Not really bad -- but overpriced for what we got. The resort does have a great Key Lime pie, so if you can live off that, you are all set. We had booked 4 days, and I was happy to leave. Naturally, departure was not smooth -- called for bellman, waited; went to Concierge -- she called, we waited, nothing, nothing, nothing. Finally, we carried all our stuff out and left -- good riddance!! Pros: Beautiful views from oceanfront casita, infinity pool, golf course. Was nice to have a kitchen so we could make our own breakfast and avoid the $100+ we paid for the one breakfast we did buy at the resort. Cons: The service was shameful! We are big tippers usually and are happy to compliment and reward good service. There isn't enough space in Trip Advisor to document how lousy their service and attitudes are. In Sum: The views are not worth the money and frustration of being a \"guest\" here. This is an expensive place to stay, but not much value for the money. This is the first time I have written a negative review -- beware unless you are the most patient and longsuffering type of person.", "Date": "July 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat Resort for a family vacation - a few small issues\u201d", "Author": "Hemicuda426", "ReviewID": "UR34381705", "Content": "In March I booked 8 nights at the El Conquistador Resort for June/ July with a very specific Two room request as I had stayed there before and I was traveling with my wife, two kids and 76 year old Mother.

You would think the prospect of spending more than $5000.00 for the week might aid in your room choices. As a result we were booked in two rooms (not updated interiors or furniture) at the Las Casitas Village. Both rooms were on the upper floor, but in different buildings. Both rooms while dated, were comfortable and very quiet and ours included a deck with a great ocean and mountain view. The other room had a porch with not enough room to even stand. The staff at Las Casitas was great, Israel, and Alexanader to name a couple as well as the breakfast place just down the grounds from our rooms. Carlos at the restaruant near the Main Pool took great care of us. The grounds, golf course, Coqui Water Park and Palamino Island were all very relaxing and perfect spots for leisure or soaking up the sun. Be prepared to spend a few bucks for food and drink. The resort also levies a 20% Service Fee (tip) at some locations and not others. In my view they could use another casual restaurant within the resort with local food choices.

Our casita was located by the pool farthest from the main hotel, and during the week we had the pool mostly to ourselves. Staff was friendly and attentive. The waterpark offered reduced admission after 2pm--so we often went there in the afternoon. We rented a car and it was an uneventful drive--lots of huge potholes though--I'd reccommend the damage waiver--and once in Fajardo, the way to the hotel was well marked with signs.

(go early in the morning and avoid the tour crowds) Ate at the Caribe cafe once--mediocre. The restaurant at the island was good and we enjoyed lunch there twice--expect to spend about $100 for four, including tip. The wood-fire pizza place by the main pool area was good. Had takeout from the Chinese restaurant and it was fine. Ate twice at El Estacion--turn right after leaving the hotel complex--it's about a quarter mile away on the left. Food and service were excellent in a casual outdoor atmosphere. The shrimp and mahi-mahi mofongo and various pinchos were delicious. Grounds were immaculate as well as the pools. Kids wished for a larger gameroom, but really enjoyed the waterpark. Had no problems with the golf cart shuttle--and you can always enjoy a lovely walk to the main hotel through the hotel grounds.

First, I requested a quiet room, high floor location but was put on the first floor despite not many guests being there during our visit (maybe all the one bedroom casitas are ground floor?). The room was generally quiet, but there was some overhead second floor noise that could be heard now and then. Second, the wireless internet did not work in the room. After two calls to the front desk a router was brought to the room and the problem was fixed via hard line. Third, getting hand towels and a bath floor mat was a daily issue (it seemed they were always short of these items), although the nightly turn down service housekeeper was very attentive and always got we requested. Fourth, Palomino Island was not as nice as expected. We like soft sand and the area is a dead coral reef. You cannot walk into the water comfortably without water shoes. For the pure nature lovers the beach and water are fine, but for those quests wanting more of the clear soft sand feel this is not the beach for you. Finally, upon check out we were double billed for the use of rental tennis rackets. Upon pointing this out the clerk corrected the problem. Overall, despite the minor issues raised above, we were very satisfied with our stay. The grounds are beautiful, the service golf cart transportation guys/girls were fast, efficient, and friendly, the pools are nice, etc. Of course, all this comes at a price - we paid $448 per night for a one bedroom garden facing casita (i.e., meaning the parking lot) once the room, taxes, and resort fee were added up (fourth night was free based on the ongoing promotion which helped A LOT with our ability to afford the room).

We were promised 24 hr butler service, and we saw that butler once. Service there, is a nightmare. You do not get prompt responces for ANYTHING. I called for more coffee for the machine in our room, and they only had decaf...so I had to order room service coffee... at 18.00 a pot plus tip and delivery fee was a 24 pot of coffee. Also they close room service from 4-6. With two little kids, sometimes I need food during that time, Speaking of food, the food on property STINKS and its over priced. I dont mind spending money on good food, but not crappy food. We ended up going to the Ritz for dinner (BLT steak) fantastic. My husband paid 30 for a skirt steak, that was sub par at the cafe caribe. Off resort is the way to eat. There is fantastic PR food nearby. You have to travel by golf cart to the main hotel by golf cart to most of the activities. Which would be fine, if you diddnt always have to wait for a cart. And hope no one else is also waiting. The private island is nice, the pools are nice, the casino is small and was very crowded and the people were a bit rude. I dont like being pushed off of gaming tables when I'm playing by over zealous people with no attention being paid by employees. Just a personal peeve possibly. The location is about an hour from San Juan, we had rented a car, as there were other things we wished to see. The driving in PR is awful, and it takes forever to get to SJ, even though its 30 miles away. So the only activities are pretty much at the resort. I do recommend the horseback tour on the island, It was beautiful, the guide knowledgable, and fun! Most horse tours I have taken are flat, and boring, This one fantastic and worth the money. WATCH your bill also, and be aware that the resort will add on a resort tax (about 30 a day) and 14% resort fee... which on a 700 room is about 90 dollars a day. I also was given a discount card for the casitas, that read 50% off kid camp, 15% off food, 20% off golf and spa. I was charged FULL for everything. I had to review everything and make them aware of their errors. I was charged in full for camp coqui, which is states on their website as 75 per child for a full day. Somehow I was charged 160 one day and 170 the next. when it should have been 150 total. I was overcharged for babysitting, (the babysitter was fabulous though) and the staff acted like I was missing a few crews when poiting out the errors. I wont return there, and am disapointed in the waldorf chain for promoting this location the way they do.

Not an Oxymoron!\u201d", "Author": "Traveller22222", "ReviewID": "UR26493657", "Content": "After reading the tripadvisor reviews, we decided to spring for the extra $50/night to stay at Las Casitas instead of El Conquistador. Upon arrival we saw that we instantly recouped $15/day of that because El Conq. charges $15day for parking and at Las C. it is free. Also Las C. gives free water bottles and free internet usage, while El C. charges for both. However, both parts of the resort are highly dedicated to and very skilled at separating you from your money. Breakfast for a family of 4 at one of the resort restaurants would be at least $75 for the most basic order. There is a 20% surcharge added to everything. I don't even want to think about what dinner would have cost. Fortunately we didn't have to! Getting into the car and driving for less than 5 minutes, we found a \"Sizzler\" restaurant (part of the US chain) They have a fabulous buffet - $10/pp all you can eat - including salads galore, lots of great fruit, Puerto Rican specialities, and American standbys, as well as ice cream sundaes for dessert. Best of all, they decided that our teenagers (14 & 18) qualified for the children's rate of $6. Hence, we fed this family of four for well under $40 including tip. That might have covered one person's appetizer back at the resort. One of the reasons we wanted to stay at El C. in the first place was because we heard that the snorkeling was good right off the island beach. There wasn't actually that much to see, at least where we went. And make sure you aren't prone to motion sickness before going on the boat to the island - no matter how calm it looks, it is quite a rocky ride on the way out (not so much coming back) because you are going against the waves. However, it does only take 15 minutes (the resort claims 7-10, I don't know why) so I doubt anyone actually gets seasick, just uncomfortable. The pool at Las Casitas is so beautiful I didn't mind not going to the beach the second day. It is designed to appear as if the edge of the pool is continuous with the horizon (hence the name \"infinity pool\") It really is breathtakingly beautiful. However, the price of all those beautiful vistas is lots of stair climbing! If you have bad knees or other reasons to avoid lots of stairs, the resort says it has a shuttle, but I never saw it. I think you have to call it when you want it. On our last day there at the end of February, Hilton Hotels acquired the entire resort, so I don't know what changes Hilton will institute. (I hope they don't replace the nice lotions and soaps with the foul-smelling Hilton variety!) We loved it there! As a 2 day splurge at the end of our week on another part of Puerto Rico, it filled our memories with enough visions of those endless turquoise waters to sustain us for the rest of winter in the frozen, grey Northeast. I would definitely go again.", "Date": "March 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Woodstock, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cParadise in the Caribbean, my favorite vacation spot!\u201d", "Author": "acequeen", "ReviewID": "UR25108355", "Content": "I have stayed at the El Conquistador several times, so I knew by staying at Las Casitas we couldn't lose.

It was quiet and peaceful. Las Casitas is private, so guests from the El Conquistador cannot use the amenities, but Las Casitas guests use the amenities at the El Conquistador. We enjoyed dining at the Strip House and Sting Ray Cafe at the El Conquistador. Expect to spend $300 or $400 on dinner for 4 or more if you get wine. There is a great kids program in the evenings for ages 5 and up. It's called club Pirata, it is upstairs in the El Conquistador near the restaurants. Parents can drop their kids off while dining.

Our casitas was good size and fairly clean, however, our toilet backed up every time we used it and the response time from the hotel staff was way too long. In addition, the room was not stocked as it should have been, short on towels, no coffee etc. To make matters worse on the the last night we found a 2 inch roach in our sofa bed. The quality of the food was also pretty low and outrageously expensive. It is just about impossible to eat at a restaurant for less than $25-$30 per person ( and this was at the grill by the pool). While the facility is very nice and includes golf, tennis, beach and water park there is virtually nothing outside the resort, which makes it tough for non beach lovers (like my husband).

The view alone was worth the money. The whole resort seemed to be about 10% full, which I didn't mind because it was so quiet and peaceful. My husband would've enjoyed a game of beach volleyball, but there weren't enough people to play. The service we had was top notch (Pablo especially). We were wondering if the hotel was full if we would've had such great service. My husband loves to golf, but he is always disappointed in caribbean golf courses, but not the course here. He was impressed with the course and thought the clubs were above par for rentals. They had his shoes & clubs waiting for him in a cart when he arrived for his tee time. Upon completion, he was handed a cold towel. Nice touch. The Spa: I need a whole paragraph to describe the spa. It was the best spa I've ever been to. Unlike most spas, you actually felt like they wanted you to stay and enjoy the amenities. We went to the spa so often we joked that it cost more than our casita. The treatment rooms were quiet (usually at spas I can hear people outside in the hallways, etc). I like the fact that they added in the 20% for tips so you didn't have to worry about it. Some people might not like that or feel that 20% is excessive, but we usually tip 20%, so I liked it. It just seemed like the spa thought of everything. From good cold refreshing water, to iced down cold towels, to awesome hair/body products. They had a \"tea room\" where they served tea (obviously) and had huge futons and couches which were so comfortable and clean. Everything in the entire spa was clean and good smelling. They even had orchids out between the sinks. They had clean brushes/combs and every other bathroom necessity you could think of. Instead of just handing you a pair of one size fits all slippers, here they had your actual size which I appreciated. Restaurants: OVERPRICED beyond belief. Blossoms was so mediocre I was surprised. Our meal was over $200.00 and I felt it was worth $80 total. The steakhouse did have a good strip and I had excellent tuna, but a bottle of win that should cost $40 in a restaurant was over $100 here. Otello's is no longer there, but it was the opening night for a new italian restaurant & that was the one really good meal we had. The outrageous bill didn't bother me as much b/c I enjoyed the meal. Ballyhoos was closed due to construction. We had friends that loved hanging out at this bar so we were disappointed alittle bit. But since the resort was so empty it probably wouldn't have been a lively hotspot anyway. Casino: There's a picture of a craps table on their website which does not exist. There is no craps. I didn't care, but my husband loves craps. They had 1 full table of blackjack going & I joined five other people and sat down at another table, but they didn't have enough dealers & we had to wait almost an hour for them to open our table. I've never had to sit around and wait to lose money before. Annoying. Since the place was so empty, the casino seemed boring. Not enough sights and sounds. It was probably a good thing b/c we only went the one time and probably saved ourselved hundreds of dollars. We rented a car outside the resort at Cabrera's car rental. Waaaaay cheaper. We did the rainforest thing & it was great. We were slightly disappointed in the Bio Bay. You are no longer allowed to get into the water, so you can only see so much when putting your hand in the water or moving your oar around. The funnest thing we did was an ATV tour in Luquillo at a family owned ranch. They had horses (ones that actually looked very healthy and alert), go karts, mountain bikes and ATV's. It was called Hacienda Carabali's and the tour guide we had was fantastic. He spoke in english & spanish. Overall, we loved Puerto Rico more than any other beach destination we've been to. There are so many activities and so much beautiful nature here. The weather was perfect and so was the hotel. We're already planning a return (hopefully in February). We feel like we did so much while here, but only just scraped the surface of what P.R. has to offer. We didn't explore Old San Juan at all & wished we had. Next time for sure. So, pack your wallet (you'll need it here) and don't be cheap or you won't enjoy yourself here.

A shuttle was waiting for us at the airport ($60.00 rt) and we had a pleasant ride for 1 1/2 hours till we arrived. The property is huge and Las Casitas is situated atop a small mountain overlooking the Caribean. We didn't realize that Las Casitas is basically joined to the El Conquistador Casino. It is separated by a little strip of property and a pool. Las Casitas is the lovely, quiet property with orchids growing on palm trees, while El Conquistador is a lively place with restaurants and gift stores etc. Don't buy water, as they come to your room every evening and ask if you'd like bottled water. (I did drink tap water there on one occasion and had no problems). There were a couple of little stores where you could buy sandwiches and also a starbucks. Of course, anything you buy in the store is really expensive. The restaurants were expensive and food was blah. I don't mind paying 25.00-40.00 for excellent food, but.......pretty disappointing. We found that the best bet for breakfast was the Caribe Cafe. We were disapointed that there's no place to get a cocktail at Las Casitas. We went to the infinity pool one evening and there's no bar service. The view was so fabulous and there was a breeze and a glass of wine would have been great. We skipped the breakfast at Las Casitas. It was expensive and I saw a bird walking around amidst the food, while the employees ignored it and continued chatting. We thought there would be a beach, but there isn't one on the property. There is a beach though! You take a free tram to the bottom of the mt. from El Conquistador, then take a free ferry to El Palamino Island. The resort owns this island and it is beautiful!! I sat under palm trees, sipping a mojito and reading Jimmy Buffet's book \"A Pirate Turns 50\" while looking out at the water. Oh my goodness... all the various colors of blue and green!! We rented snorkeling equipment for $16.00 and proceeded to swim to another, smaller island nearby. There are several coral reefs and the snorkeling was great. We ate at the Iguana Cafe and it was fine. As we were sitting there, a rooster walked by, then a long black lizard and then a rabbit. I saw an iguana when trying to take a short cut across a field to the Rest room. Anyway, this Palamino island was my favorite thing to do and it was free. We wanted to see Old San Juan and El Junque rain forest, but we had already spent so much on food, so headed to enterprise rental car at El Conquistador. Javier was great and got us fixed up for a day for 89.00. We saved by not doing those tours and did it our way. The rain forest was beautiful although we didn't see any green parrots or birds. We did do the touristy deal of walking to the big waterfall and it was worth it. Along the way there are all kinds of swimming holes and other smaller waterfalls you can sit in, but when we got to the big one, a guy helped me up the ledge and I leaned back under the falls. You talk about exhilarating!! I'm 48 so anyone can do it! San Juan was ok. I'm used to New Orleans and it seemed like a less charming version of that. Not that NO is always that charming. :-) Anyway, we did stock up on a few grocery items and wine. We stopped at a local restaurant called Racine's (sp ?) and had the Mufungo. It was good. One thing about PR, is we never saw vegetables on the menu, unless you call ice burg lettuce and a slice of tomato your veggie! My poor travel companion was hoping to get some salsa dancing under her belt. The only place around was a bar at El Conquistador. We waited and waited till they opened one night. Alll we saw were teenagers/college age kids!! Go figure! We finally got a tip about local food. We were told to go down the tram, through the marina parking lot and then continue around the side of the mountain on a little road. Sure enough there were a few little restaurants. Nothing fancy and all open air, but festive and fun. We went to Oceanview and they had a band with steel drums etc. Very fun and of course we had more Mofongo!! This time around we were with the locals and the food was good and reasonable. The people in PR were so nice and friendly. Also, no begging! My travels in Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Mexico, and Barbados involved people coming up to me on the beach in the water or whereever, trying to sell stuff. Our room at Las Casitas was lovely and the bathroom was great. There is a coffee maker, blow dryer, iron and big magnifying mirror. Only complaint is the lack of any bar service and no nice restaurant with good food.

Although he is from NY he has lived in PR for 20 years and was a wealth of information. On the way back to the airport he drove us through Old San Juan to show us the sites. Since it was Good Friday, all of the stores were closed. The cost was $290 for all of us. I highly recommend this service. We took full advantage of having a stocked kitchen Each family packed a suitcase of non-perishable foods (muffins, cereal bars; pop tarts; gold fish crackers; fruit roll-ups, etc.....) and then we sent in an order prior to our stay to have other food (meat; cheese; milk, etc...) in our refrig when we arrived.

We did eat dinner out near the marina one night....our bill for 10 people with tip was $185. The food was average and very expensive considering we only had burgers and cokes!!!! The butler service was non-existent and, overall, the service is not that of a 5 star hotel. While everyone is very nice, they are not proactive in asking if you need anything. Our butler announced when we arrived that he would be off for the next 2 days. He said his partner would be able to help us but we never heard from him again. We finally saw them the night before we were leaving to see when he should come by to bring down our luggage. It would have been nice to be contacted each day to see if we needed anything. The private island is very nice and was not crowded considering it was spring break/holy week. The boat to the island was easy to use and the kids really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, the island closed down for the remainder of our stay because Puerto Rico was experiencing 20 foot waves (first time in 45 years!!!). We brought a soft cooler of sandwhches, fruit and drinks to the island. Everyone seems to do this. The water park is fun and I recommend only doing a half day. It is small with only 3 rides and a lazy river......I do not think it warrants a full day. We were able to bring our own snacks and drinks. My husband and friend played golf and said the course was very nice with beautiful views. They brought their own shoes but rented clubs. My friend and I used the spa and had a message. It was great!!!! You are able to use the spa amenities all day for no extra charge. Since we had 6 kids waiting for us, we only stayed for about 2 hours. There are plenty of pools to choose from with the Infinity pool at the casitas being the prettiest. I would definitely go back to this hotel even though the food and service are below par. The grounds are beautiful, the views are breathtaking and the casitas are worth the price. Next time I would rent a car and venture off the poroperty. I would have loved to taste Puerto Rican food -- which is non-existent at the hotel. I recommend this resort for families with kids.

Our villa was in the south Village of Las Casitas and although we did walk once to the main hotel, its all uphill and we only did it once. I'd definitely recommend Las Casitas and we're certainly planning to go back.

The buttler service was ok, i met him on the check in process but, since i never needed nothing special, i didnt bother them. besides they seems to be overwork.

Some in our party used the spa for massages and hair/nails as well. No real complaints to speak of, and overall I was very happy with our vacation. The resort is quite large, so depending on exactly where your room is, you can expect to spend 10 minutes or more getting from one part of the resort to another. Since the beach is on Palomino island, it is a bit of an investment in time to get there: walk to the funicular, take it down, wait for the ferry to the island, ride the ferry, and you're there. To be safe, leave 30 minutes or more each way: ferry ride alone is about 10 minutes but you need to be there early to get in line or you have to wait for the next one (they left roughly every 30 minutes). You should expect to spend a lot of money on meals, unless you use the kitchen in your unit to do your own cooking (not my idea of a vacation). For example, at lunch a burger with fries will run you roughly $13-15 and throw in another $6 or more for a frozen drink. Obviously this starts to add up quickly if you have a large group. We were there over the president's day holiday weekend, and although there were a lot of people at the resort, it did not feel overcrowded. By midweek many folks had left to go home. We at at Blossoms at one of the Benihana-style tables, and also at Otello's, the Italian restaurant. Both meals were quite good, in fact I was surprised at how good the food was. The service was quite good in the restaurants as well. Some other tips: * If you plan to go to the island/beach when the resort is busy you will want to go early so you can find some chairs in the shade either under a hut or tree. * It may be advisable to make your dinner reservations shortly after you reserve your room, again depending on whether it is a busy time at the resort.", "Date": "February 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "purechic", "Title": "\u201cBest Family Vacation\u201d", "Author": "purechic", "ReviewID": "UR13795318", "Content": "I am currently planning my next family vacation to Las Casitas. Although I have stayed at the El Conquistador resort several times before (and had a wonderful experience each time), last year was our first stay at Las Casitas. I feel that it was THE BEST family vacation we have ever had. We had a garden two bedroom casita. My husband and I had one bedroom with a king bed and bath and my three children had their own room with two double beds and their own bathroom. Anyone traveling with children can relate to the expense of having to get two rooms. Our 2 bedroom casita totally solved that problem. I felt that we all had our space when we needed it. We had 3 separate balconys to relax on. The kitchen was amazing. How nice to have a fully stocked refridgerator on a carribean island! The butler service was perfect. Everything we asked for was taken care of immediately. Every item we ordered for our kitchen was there upon our arrival. To me that made it very worth the price. We were able to eat breakfast at our leisure in the morning and have snacks whenever during the day. I loved the privacy and the quiet of las casitas. The staff was very accomodating and prompt. I go into any vacation we take expecting to pay resort prices for food. It is a resort. I didnt find the prices exhorbitant. There are many choices for dining. And if you dont wish to have an expensive dinner there are other options on the resort. I hope this review helps anyone who is \"on the fence\" about visiting Las Casitas. It is one of the best vacations my family ever took. The large two bedroom casita was perfect for our 5 person family. The island is lovely and the boatride is relaxing. There is a nice lunch restaurant on the island for lunch and drinks. Water sports and activities are a lot of fun. One nice thing about the private island is that it is really private. There are no bothersome vendors and salespeople wandering the beach trying to sell their wares. I found that to be a nice change from other islands we have visited. There are lots of little nooks to explore on walks while on the island. There is horseback riding there as well which was quite fun. You can explore the entire island and the view from the top is exhilarating. Expect to walk a bit to the various areas. The resort is tremendous but the view is breathtaking all around the resort.

We arrived and everything was fine at check in, then they showed us to our casita ( 1 bedroom villa) with living and kitchen areas. As soon as we stepped in we could smell the strong odor of mold. Before letting the bell man leave I looked around, the bedroom area was decorated and stunk no better than a motel that you would pay $50 for a night! A second later as I was looking around I stepped right into a puddle of water and realized that there was a major leak on the walls of the bedroom and all across the ceiling and floors...it was disgusting. Not 5 star at all. So I called the front desk, and they did not believe me at first, so they first sent us a maid to \"clean it up\" (you cant just wipe up a major leak!) then when the maid said she couldnt do anything about it, I called the front desk again and they said \"we'll send the engineer\" , so we patiently waited and again the engineer said he cant do anything about a major leak. So about 2 hours later after all this chaos of them not just taking my word about the leak a lady at reception named Laura told us the only other casita available was very far all the way down the hill and was a 2 bedroom, newly renovated casita. Thank g-d she gave us that room because if not my husband and I were ready to leave and go to the Ritz in San Juan. The newly renovated casita was absolutely gorgeous with spectacular views and wrap-a-round terraces with lounge chairs and tables and so on. The bathrooms were nice but not great. Same thing with the beds, not too comfortable, but manageable. It was great having the new kitchen and large open living area, but had it not been for the leak in the old casitas we never would have got this room. Now that leaves me to wonder how the hotel is still renting out the old casitas with that are infested with mold and water and just felt damp and gross... The second terrible thing was the service, the place is just way too big, I guess, the service was awful, for example the morning that we left I called for some shampoo and conditioner at 9 o clock, half an hour goes, then an hour, and I finally call again, they just apologize, but if it was the only time, I would understand, but everything is in slow motion. At the pool and ocean they dont ask you if you want a drink you have to wave down the only waiter that is serving 100's or people, then when the drinks arrive 30 mins later they are no longer even frozen! I really dont understand because the more waiters, the more drinks served and bought which means more $ for the hotel... The service for the shuttle was ok but not great, we just called and told them to call our room when the shuttle was arriving. However when we needed a shuttle from the main hotel back to the casitas it took close to fifteen minutes.. We didnt eat any of the food at the hotel, but did order a fruit platter from room service, I thought Puerto Rican fruit was good, man was I wrong, the fruit had absolutely no taste as if it was not in season at all... All in all, the newly renovated casitas have great views and are roomy, but the service was definintely lacking, and I would not come here again nor recommend it.

The resort is clean, well landscaped and quiet with three distinctively beautiful pools. The garden courtyards with babbling fountains provide a perfect peaceful touch, far from the hustle and bustle of the main resort at El Conquistador. Much of what had made Las Casitas Village a five diamond resort years ago remains, but what brings it down is the lack of customer service and attention to detail at the main resort, El Conquistador. We were totally surprised at the amount of trash--- piles of it---on the beaches at Palomino Island. The beach bar tenders were lazy and rude. When we called the manager's office at El Conquistador to complain about the trash, we were told he would return our call---he never did. The staff at Las Brisas Restaurant is horrible. Don't go there if you don't intend to order the breakfast buffet. They have no time for you if you order off the menu. The staff at Otello's; The Strip House; and Bella Vista are all wonderful, so it's isolated pockets of rude and poor service that no one should have to experience especially when paying for over priced drinks and food. Keep an eye on what you're paying for as a Mojito at Las Casitas costs $16 and $8 at the Bella Vista Bar at El Conquistador. Las Casitas bars and restaurants automatically add a 20% gratuity, but not at the El Conquistador restaurants and bars, so be careful to check.

Everything we experienced was positive. It was quiet, peaceful, clean, accomodating, family friendly (everyone seemed to have kids), easy, worth every penny. Anything negative that I read online beforehand or heard in person while we were there, was easily worked around. I along with nearly everyone we spoke to seemed to feel that the positivies more than outweighed the negatives. Here were a few things we worked around... The food is expensive!! For some reason when I read that, I thought we would be able to make better restaurant/menu selections and not spend $250 a night on dinner. On average you are going to be looking at $16 burgers, $44 steaks, $10 mixed drinks. As soon as we arrived we spoke to our butler about creating an order for groceries and I even took someone's advice from this site & added alcohol to the list. Others we met hopped in a taxi and went to Wal-Mart themselves. Las Casitas sends someone to the grocery store and charges you based on what you spend, so it ends up being $25 for every $100 you spend. We spent $150 for groceries, two bottles of alcohol and the surcharge & it kept us in stocked for breakfast & lunch the entire visit. The beach is rocky. For the most part it's actually broken coral from a reef that you can walk out to. We wore flip flops in the water, which wasn't ideal, but wasn't a problem either. None of the kids seemed phased and most of the adults seemed okay to consider it a non-issue. NO INTERNE or movies! They are accomodating and will let you use the internet in the Las Casitas office. Otherwise, you have to take your laptop to the main hote (El Conquistador) for wireless access. They said they are working on getting wireless to Las Casitas, so at the very least check in with them. Also, our living room had a DVD player, but there were no On Demand movies available. They said they don't have a subscription for anything other than the El Conquistador, so if keep that in mind if your like to curl up with an On Demand movie during your vacation.", "Date": "August 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cTerrible!

I think it is the best placed I have stayed. They gave you slippers which made it nice. The infinity pool was awesome. Very relaxing even when there are lots of peoples the view is so breath taking that you forget about annoying people around you. Is great that you can enjoy the Conquistador Hotel facilities, restaurants and pools. There are also two other pools at las casitas village and a few more in the conquistador. The golf cart ride from las casitas to el conquistador is fun. Palomino was great. The food at palomino was good. Is something like chili's quality. You can snorkel .. not great snorkeling but very entertaining and safe. The beach has lots of algae so bring beach slippers. There are nice beach umbrellas at Palomino if you want to stay away from the sun. The trip to Palomino Island is 7 minutes. They don't allow outside beverages or food but you can always pack a few in your back pack if you want to save a few bucks. The beach at Palomino is not that great but just knowing that you are in a small island makes it very interesting and fun. There are beach sports like Kayak rental and I think you can Kayak to palominito island which is another cute small little island half a mile from palomino. Beach sports are not free. Had Sushi at Blossoms one night and it was New York grade sushi and not too expensive considering that you are at a hotel. The conquistador lobby is nice and big overlooking the ocean and the pools. Service was Ok . The rooms were not super clean but enough for me. Tiles are harder to clean I guess. The balcony was huge and nice. If you can get a room with ocean view go for it .. is gorgeous. All rooms seem to be close to the parking but there are always stairs that will make you think twice to ask for help. The personal butler never showed and never heard of such a thing. Had no problem getting towels anywhere at the hotel. People were very friendly. This was definitely a great stay. They only minor flaw was the room floor which was a little bit dirty especially after moving the beds they don't clean under the beds. If you want ice you have to call room service. Cannot just grab it yourself. I don't know if there was a charge for that but heard that they charge for every call you make. I had no problems with my bill. Everything was in place and payed nothing extra for parking. Maybe they forgot to charge that? or parking is free ? I paid everything with my credit card cause I was warned about overcharges if using the cards they give you. I guess you should never mention your room number. I got to the hotel at 3:30 but the room was not ready. Had to wait for 2 hours but you can start using the facilities. Used all coffee the first day but never got refills. But at least someone came to asked if we needed anything and they gave us more towels and two little tasty chocolates. I paid $267 per night and it was definetly worth it with all the ammenities included. No kitchen in the guest rooms. This room is great for two people and one child. I am not sure that paying $ 400 per night is worth it but at least you get 2+ bedrooms and a kitchen. El conquistador is a few bucks cheaper but I rather pay 50 to 100 bucks more per night at las casitas for the guest room. They don't give you toothbrush/tooth paste so bring your own. My Wife did a room service check. She marked the glasses of te bathrooms slightly + the disposable coasters and they were not changed after room service. Don't expect great service but if you want to enjoy a nice and very relaxing place with a cute little island which is free to visit in a big resort with a breath taking infinity pool Las Casitas village is one of the best in puerto rico maybe in the Caribbean.", "Date": "July 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cWill Certainly Return\u201d", "Author": "Bowhead", "ReviewID": "UR8122025", "Content": "This review is long overdue, but the urge struck me as I was planning my return visit to Las Casitas in February.

Where do I start...I have stayed at the El Con a number of times, however this was my first visit to the resort with my family, so I decided to book a stay at Las Casitas. My wife, three children(2,7,9) and I stayed in a 2 bedroom casita overlooking the ocean. Wow, what a view! Check-in was a breeze, and we were immediately greeted by our butler, Luis Posada. While I can't comment on the other butlers, I cannot say enough about Luis. He was always there (except for the day he was off), extremely attentive, very proffessional and courteous. He certainly made our stay much more enjoyable. The pools are great. The private Island is very relaxing. As for the food...True, it is expensive, but not outrageously expensive. We ate off campus a couple of times and it was great. Would highly reccomend trying that. As for the service...If you are looking for 5 star New York or Paris service, you won't get it here. However, keep in mind THIS IS THE CARRIBEAN...Relax. If you are looking for 5 star Carribean service, Las Casitas delivers. No matter what resort I am at, It is very rare that I can travel with 3 small children and truly feel relaxed, but Las Casitas pulled it off. For that, I am extremely thankful.

I mistakenly booked a guest room instead of the one bedroom villa, but we still were not disappointed. We also thought the cost of the room was very reasonable. The one thing that we totally agree on in the other reviews is that it is quite expensive. We first thought these were travelers who may not want to \"pay\" or perhaps weren't discriminating, but Las Casitas is expensive. You don't get a break on anything. Take others advice and do your own shopping for meals in on some days. We ate at several of the restaurants and our favorite was Strip Steakhouse. Service was great! Our steaks were flavorful and cooked to perfection. Seafood pasta amazing and fresh. Our server was even great with our 4 year old daughter who was out with us very late since it was our last night. Stingray Cafe was also really good. Best place for burgers- Virgin Burgers by one of the main pools. Palomino Island was a lot of fun. Great for entire family regardless of ages. Kids club seemed really good although we didn't use it. We definitely agree with those who said to rent a car. It gave us the flexibility to go off the property and explore on our own. It turned out to be cost effective, but also gave us the flexibility we needed with a 4-year old. We explored the El Yunque on our own and had a wonderful time. In addition, we hung out at Lucillo Beach and did the Bay Biolumenescent on our own. Overall it was a great trip. We would visit again with groceries.

Here's a solution to the expensive restaurants: rent a car and go off campus. Casitas charges a very high $65 per person to and from the airport. Instead of a couple paying that $260, rent a car for less than that and go out to dinner each night (and go to a nearby grocery and get some breakfast stuff).

We stayed in one of the newer 3 bdrm casitas and it was incredible. Beautiful view. Quiet. Private. Granted, we're not used to staying in the Ritz or other luxury type resorts like some of those offering reviews....we're more like Hampton Inn/Embassy Suites kind of people. So for us, this was a dream vacation and a dream location. The pools were great. Palomino Island was great. A couple helpful notes perhaps: 1. Renting a car was helpful. You can do it at the resort but we did it from San Juan for the week. Much cheaper this way if you want to take tours on your own and not rely on all resort tours. For example, the Rainforest tour was approx. $50/person through the resort, but if you drove yourself, if was only $3/per person. Big Difference. We also saved the $60/person shuttle fee from the airport to the resort. We 'pricelined' a compact car for the week for about $180. 2. There's a grocery store about 5-7 minutes away. Stock up on breakfast foods, sodas, snacks, etc. The food is way overpriced...but that's resort food anywhere so you really shouldn't be shocked. 3. I'd highly recommend the Biolumenescient Bay tour. Very cool and unique experience. The same stuff that makes lightning bugs light up is found in these single cell plankton (1.6 million/gallon) and you can kayak out into a bay and swim and see your arms and feet glow as you swim around. Awesome. 4. If you want to snorkel, you can rent equipment on Palomino island for $8/person and snorkel on your own and see some very cool things versus the $60/person snorkeling tours. Granted, you may see more out on the tours, but if you're a novice and just want to experience it...go the cheap route. 5. My wife loved her spa experience and felt very pampered...much more so than any spa she's been to before. 6. You can walk to just about anywhere you want to get to in about 10 minutes or so. You can get shuttled anywhere you like as well, but we enjoyed the walks. 7. As for the 'fine dining' restaurants, we ate at Blossom's (chinese and japanese) and Isabella's (steak). Both were okay, but not great. I've had better steaks, but it wasn't bad and the chinese food we had was better than average. 8. One thing you can inquire about is a vacation planner.

The room was OK, but considering that we payed over $1000 per night, I would have expected much more. The beds were what I would expect to find at a Motel 6, the tub and sinks didn't drain, and the floor was tile with no rugs in the bedrooms. My feet got dirty as I walked barefoot across the floor. The refrigerator broke, flooding the kitchen. We had to wait over 2 hours for a repair person to arrive. The maid had not left us ANY towels that day, so we had no way to mop up the wet mess ourselves while we waited. My uncle got locked in the bathroom, due to a broken door. He finally had to muscle his way out, as help was not forthcoming. The laundry staff ruined two shirts which were to be worn for the wedding cerimony. My father-in-law had over $900 stolen from his in-room safe. The hotel management offered absolutely no apology or compensation for our troubles.The staff was rude and unhelpful. I asked a pool staff member to move an umbrella for me so my children would get shaded from the sun. The surly staffer hastily grabbed an umbrella from neighboring chairs and halfheartedly placed it so that about half our chairs were shaded. I was about to ask for a second umbrella, but the staffer had already marched away. The clay tennis courts were uneven and poorly maintained. I would not be upset by such treatment if I were staying at a two or three star resort - however, I do expect a certain level of service when I am paying over $1000 per night for a so-called 5 star resort.

It promises iced Caviar and Champagne and delivers Soggy Peanuts and warm Ripple. I am of course referring the Las Casitas Village part of the Resort that offers itself up as a rarified experience. I am an experienced traveler with friends on travel desks at two major publications who fell victim to a marketing trap, ignored the advice of my travel card advisor and booked directly on-line. Shame on me. Las Casitas says \"expect to be pampered by your personal butler that tends to your every need\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd instead expect a guy that speaks no English to show up at your door on the morning of your check out, hand you his professionally designed business card (I put mine in my scrapbook) and wait for a gratuity. This after 7 days at Las Casitas and at check out, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve finally met my personal butler, a celebrity moment in my life. The hotel describes luxurious suites and appointments and if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re lucky, you will get my suite and have a waterfall, right in your suite, but alas it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the AC that drips water from behind the bedroom wall and puddles under your bed. The hotel engineer, a really nice guy and a Boss, told me that you have to expect water leaking if you put the AC on, he suggested we use the ceiling fans, I told him it was very warm and humid and that I like AC. Also, standing 6\u00e2\u20ac\u21223\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a room with 8\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ceilings the fans actually hung pretty close to my head. OK so I slouched a lot, avoided the fans and went to the Golden Door Spa for comfort and escape from my Luxurious suite. The Golden Door Spa is OK but not worth the bucks, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect w new age experience as much as an 80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left over. But the staff attentive but should lose the attitude; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the Ritz Carlton, now that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Spa. Oh, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to leave out the high end fixtures and faux finishes in the Bathrooms. But alas, the fixtures were broken and the fuax finish was actually lines of solid rust on your bathroom walls (yes, I tried my best to clean them off). To be fair, we did get some of the renowned Las Casitas personal attention when we got locked out of our room on five different nights. Calling from my cell phone to the front desk and after an hour sitting outside on a curb, a bellman would arrive, always smiling, apologizing and explaining \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this happens all the time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not forget the sterling management at the El Conquistador Resort & Las Casitas Village and Golden Door Spa. It seems that everyone is a manager or boss or an executive at the Hotel, maybe that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the problem, they need actual workers. Finally, watch you Credit Card at the El Conquistador Resort & Las Casitas Village and Golden Door Spa or you might find a charge on the credit card that you checked in with for $20,000 (yes, its true, it really happened to me). They explained that this was a legitimate charge for \"possible charges\" that you \"might\" make during your stay, but I was reassured by the Manger at the front desk, not too worry, management at the resort will gladly refund my money, soon and if I complain, and if they call you back, my credit card company is investigating. We got a lot of apologies at El Conquistador Resort & Las Casitas and Golden Door Spa where employees, bosses, management seem confused and distant but achieve amazing clarity when they aggressively look to your for a gratuity. A bright spot are the wonderful restaurants. my advice unless you wanabe be a wanabe, is to eat at the many good restaurants at El Conquistador Resort & Las casitas Village and Golden Door Spa, stay away from the very public \u00e2\u20ac\u0153private\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd beach on an island by the Marina and, now read carefully, sleep someplace else.

Concierge/butler service was a joke. For the price we paid we expected a lot more .... Room service requests had to be chased up on several occasions, it took us over 45 minutes to get some ice delivered on 2 occasions!!! Food was very expensive and poor quality at Las Casitas ( thank goodness for some good local restaurants outside the resort) and service in the restaurants was lacking in all respects, staff appeared untrained, demotivated, disinterested and even the management handled our concerns with borderline disinterest. Whilst there, sadly we frequently heard other customers complaining of the slow, poor service and poor food quality. If not for the location we would have checked out and found somewhere else after the first night...despite our complaints, it did not get any better for the rest of the stay.

We went over Easter weekend and stayed in a 3 bedroom ground level casitas. We were in the middle section by the Manor house which was very conveniently located by both the infinity pool and our local pool. We chose to not have an ocean view as we were not sure how safe it was for our young child over the bluff. (It is very safe in hindsight). We arrived Good Friday and the resort was very busy. Many PR families came to the resort for the weekend and as a resul t the pool and ferry was very busy. We visited Palamino Island and were underwhelmed. We also found the ferry process - a significant process and not worth the effort. We instead decided to take daily road trips in the morning and visit local beaches - Luquillo and Seven Seas. During the week it was very quiet at both the beaches and the pools. We met many local PR families and enjoyed learning about where they lived and what extended family members were in the U.S. Everyone we met were very nice. We went to Seven Seas Beach 3 times and it is right up the road from the resort. Our butlers Ricardo and Carlos were very attentive and helped us decide what places were worth the visit. For example, we wanted to go to Viques for the day but with a young child - they advised against it since it would take too long and not be interesting enough. We bought groceries from Amigos down the road and rented a car which gave us freedom to sight see independently. We went to the El Yunque Rainforest and hiked one of the trails with a waterfall. We went out to dinner and the food was fine. Service at Otello was extremely slow and chaotic. Blossom's Japanese was the best service and especially with kids. We ate in at the Villa the rest of the time and it was much easier. All the restaurants in the Village close early and are not open for dinner or drinks. This apparently is a change due to the new owners (Blackstone Company). We did not venture up to El Conquistador pools as they looked crowded and the pools in The Casitas Village were calmer and felt more isolated. We spent the second 1/2 of each day in the pools. If you are looking for service however, this is not the pool to come too. We enjoyed our trip overall including a trip to Old San Juan and taking the new route 66 which is much faster than taking route 3 all the way into the city. Weather was great. Everyday sunny and in the mid to high 80s.
