{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not Bad, Not Great I booked this hotel after finding it in Rick Steves' Florence book. I contacted them online and was able to reserve rooms easily through e-mail.The hotel is within easy walking distance of the Santa Maria Novella train station, on a busy street. Because of this, the noise at night, even with the windows closed, can be a little much. The area of the hotel is safe, but not very picturesque. The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable, and the staff was helpful and cheerful. The breakfast was just okay - nothing special, but a welcome meal at the beginning of a day of sightseeing. You can have an espresso made for you, which is a nice touch.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking to spend a lot of time in the area, or to relax while in the hotel, but it is a good place to stay if you're traveling in and out of the city by train.", "Date": "Apr 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR481905620", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "GotABigDog"}, {"Content": "Questionable Business Practices I booked 5 rooms in this hotel 6 months in advance of the date( Nov) I wanted to stay there. When I was booking the hotel they resonded to my emails quite quickly. I verified the cancellation policy and provided them with my credit card. The trip had to be cancelled a few weeks later( April) and I emailed them to cancel the reservations well within the guidelines provided to me by the hotel to cancel at no charge. I was unable to get a response from them. I emailed again 4 days in a row with no response. I know that they were receiving and reading my emails as I have a read receipt  from my email but they would not provide me with a cancelation confirmation. I find their refusal to respond or provide me with a cancelation confirmation a suspious business practice and would not advise anyone to provide this hotel their credit card number. Now I will have to be sure to watch my credit card bill 6 months from now to make sure they are not charging me for these 5 rooms.", "Date": "Apr 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR997917135", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "loveladyc"}, {"Content": "Good Location, very clean basic hotel We stayed four nights at the Hotel Galileo in Florence during March 2008.

I was the loser. while the hotel was clean and the room and bathroom was spacious, the front desk staff was very unhelpful. I traveled thru italy for 3 weeks and this was the only hotel that i had to pay for internet service. There were internet cafes all over the place in Florence that charged .99 euro per hour while the hotel charged 3.00 per half hour. my family had lap top in every room in nearby hotel. just do not think it is right to charge for internet service. also front desk staff very rude. like i was bothering them. went out and got home at 1 in the morning to find the hotel all locked up. could not get in will i stay there again? only if i was desperate.", "Date": "Oct 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR287647561", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "skites"}, {"Content": "Wonderful stay My husband and I stayed at Hotel Galileo during our 2 night stay in Florence in mid Dec 2006. The hotel was further from the main train station than I expected (8 minutes walk) but it was a good hotel. The room was clean, of an adequate size and with a wonderful shower. It was not as noisy as what was mentioned in some of the other reviews, as the room had a double glazed window. Probably December was a quieter time compared to other months. In fact, I opened the window in the mornings to hear some of the traffic sounds just to remind myself that I was in the centre of Florence. The breakfast was adequate - breads, jams, cheese, ham, juices- enough to get you going for the day. The good thing about this hotel is the free internet in the lobby - you just need to register at the front desk and go online. Hotel Galileo is only a few minutes walk from the famous San Lorenzo street market where you will find everything under the sun - leather jackets, bags, clothes, trinkets, souvenirs, shoes, etc. We walked everywhere in Florence - things were not as far away as I thought they would be - and it was a great experience to see and shop in the stores that lined most of the streets in the centre of the city. Overall, Florence was a beautiful city, and Hotel Galieo, a good choice.", "Date": "Dec 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR156669416", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "bebe12"}, {"Content": "good basic hotel We stayed 3 nights at this hotel and found it very comfortable.

Would recommend this hotel as it is central and close to the main station. Good value for money. A short walk to the sights. Don't miss the main meat and veg market close by, interesting stuff and cheaper than the other shops. Especially the huge olives and strawberries!

We stayed here for half of our two week vacation to Italy in 2004 and LOVED it! The room was lovely, the bath was spacious (for European hotels), the staff was most helpful and it is located very close to many of the top sites.We walked everywhere--the city is MOST navigatable on foot and we found that the walking helped us to find some of the out of the way places that we may have otherwise missed.The breakfast is lovely--wide variety of choices and LOTS of coffee choices! We are planning to return in May, 2006 and cannot wait! There are several restaurants that are very good and reasonable nearby--and it is close to the city's main market.
