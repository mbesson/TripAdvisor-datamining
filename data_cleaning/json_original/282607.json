I actually slipped folded blankets under the mattress pads to give some softness. I like a firm mattress but this was as funny as an I Love Lucy episode.

The room was equipped with very good air conditioner. Nowadays the tv's in hotels are starting to be lcd-models, but Aranea has kept old tubescreens. In our room the antennasocket of the tv was so loose, that it was a matter of luck with setting the cable in right position to be able to give us some sort of picture out of the machine:) We had our room in 6th floor, but were still able to hear traffic noise down from the street, didnt bother our sleep though, but i can only imagine how it is on the floors below in case the window is on streetside..

The area around the hotel is pretty safe and quiet, but there is very little of much interest in the near vacinity of the hotel, just a few small bars, non of which looked particularly appealing to us. The lady on reception (who seemed to practically live at the hotel) was very pleasant and always willing to help. Check in was quick and easy, only problem was upon arrival we found out that they had overbooked the twin rooms and so for our first night I wound up with a camp bed! they did allow us to move the following day though. Our room was pleasant with a lovely big bathroom, and very clean, only complaint with the room was that the beds were a little too hard for my liking (I was actually wishing I'd kept the camp bed). Breakfast was enjoyable and plentiful providing you arrived early as the waiting staff were not very swift at re-stocking items at the buffet, on more than one occasion people were having to ask for specific things as no one seemed interested in re-filling anything. The buffet was your usual fair for a European hotel, bacon & eggs and a range of pastries, ham, cheese & fruit. Tip: if you do not like strong (and I do mean strong) coffee stick to fruit juice. The hotel also provides free internet access which came in handy, first thing in the morning or late at night is your best bet for using this if you don't want to have to que for the computer.

My baggage didn't make it on my flight with me, and the desk staff called the airport to make sure the bag would be delivered to the hotel (the lost baggage folks at the airport we not very organized). The one negative I have with the Apsis is that it seems to be a haven for the big cruise lines. We stayed a week and saw 3 different cruise companies come in and out.

When we arrived, the meter showed 20.05 euro, and the driver proceeded to add 7.20 euro for bags, ?, ?, and 10% for ?. It looked like the bags in the boot were about 1 euro each (I thought someone had written 6 euros each, which had seemed pretty steep, and was why we insisted on only 2 bags in the trunk). I didn't understand what the 10% was for, so I may have tipped him twice unintentionally.

To get to La Sagrada Familia one had to walk 3 blocks in one direction and then two in another direction. I would estimate this to be at least 700 - 800 m. As regards Passeig de Gracia and Placa Catalunya this first of all involved a walk to La Sagrada Famililia and then jumping on the Metro and then getting off 4 / 5 stops down the line. Overall if you want somewhere closer to the sites and a hotel with some life and soul, don't stay here. It is not worth the money. On my return I visited their website again to leave some feed back but guess what, the link has been disabled.

The hotel is modern and functional. The room was cleaned and towels changed everyday. Break fast was included and had something for all tastes(we are vegetarians and this was not a problem) Many reviews complain about the bed and the TV, but we didnt find this a problem. The bed was fine and as far as the TV is concerned, we only we there to sleep and not watch TV, which I expect is what most people will go to Barcelona for! The hotel is about 15 to 20 minutes walk to Placa Catalunya. La Sagrada familia is only a short 10 minute walk from the hotel. There are a few cafes and shops around the hotel. The area felt safe at all times of the day. Barcelona is built for pedestrians, we were impressed by the pavements in Barcelona which were in most cases wider than the roads!! Tetuan metro station is only 5 minutes from the hotel. The metro system in Barcelona is very cheap and convenient, but we walked to most places, which is the best way to see Barcelona and all its amazing buildings. Occasionally we took the metro in the evenings when we were tired. We bought a T-10 card which was sufficient for our entire 4 day stay: one T-10 card can be shared between any number of people. Be very wary of taking taxis from the Airport, they sometimes try to rip you off. Our taxi driver tried to charge us 38 euros even though the meter only indicated 21 euros (he types 38 into the keypad!!). I'd suggest if this happens, get out and ask the hotel staff to help you, especially if you do not speak much spanish! One the way back to Barcelona airport we took the metro to Sants Estacia station and took the RENFEE train to 'Aeroport' which takes 20 mins from Sants. I did a bit of research about top places to visit and veggie restaurants. If anyone wants the list, send me a message and will email it to you. Enjoy Barcelona!

However - I was celebrating our 4th anniversary with my partner - and wanted a memorable hotel. Having been to Barcelona before and stayed in the La Ramblas...I didn't want to go there again - as overpriced, and red light district springs to mind. So I'm happy to say that the Apsis Aranea is none of that. We flew Ryanair and landed into Girona - you can get a bus striaght from the airport and into the bus station at Barcelona (aprox 70mins) then its a 5min walk from the bus station to the hotel....literally a striaght line - sounds like a trek - but since we got flights fro \u00a350pp - that was fine - bus tickets were 21euro for a return. On arrival - the reception was friendly and our room ready - earlier then expected. Okay, okay - rooms are small - but after the reviews I read - I knew what to expect - but you know what - it's clean - comfortable and laid out very well - besides - a hotel is somewhere to sleep comfortably - your not going to spend ALL your time there....are you? La Ramblas is about a 15min walk away - and the Sagrada Familia - abou 10mins....OR you can get the metro - about 5mins walk away - all in all - best way to see Barcelona is by foot. And a cab back from the \"Old City\" won't set you back anymore then 6euros. We felt very safe round the area of the hotel - lots of bright lights, etc - didn't run into trouble with the renowned pick pockets - but being from London orginally - we're already street savy - a lot of it is common sense, wallet in the front pockets for men - handbags held close for women! Breakfast was included in the price of our stay - for 2nights and breakfast, inc tax - we paid \u00a3114 for 2people...pretty good I say. Breakfast was the usual continental, ham, cheese, fruits, cereal, etc - it set us up for the day. We booked through: [--] - who were also fabulous! I thoroughly recommend this hotel if you are on a budget - you'll get a decent night's sleep....though as with all hotels - bring earplugs - it's your own fault if you don't!!", "Date": "December 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cCheap, Clean and not much more!\u201d", "Author": "AdeEndacott", "ReviewID": "UR11202642", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel on the 28th of November 2007 and have mixed conclusions of the experience.

The rooms had a reasonable good size safe in the closet. I was relieved of my wallet and contents the first day on Las Ramblas but unbelieveably retrieved it back within seconds fully in tact I suspect the timely arrival of two police officers on the beat just at that time assisted in the abandonment of the crime.

There are several cafes in the area where you can get toast or pastry and coffee for breakfast for a couple of Euros. The city centre is doable on foot. The rooms were clean and staff were friendly.

They had cheese, garlic meats, toast and poached eggs. As we only had toast and poached eggs at (11 euros each) we thought that was a lot of money. The staff were too busy clearing tables instead of checking that the food bar had enough food on it. We had to ask every morning for the dishes to be filled up. Sometimes we waited 15 minutes for poached eggs and the tea-bags were extremely weak.

We got a room overlooking the intersection and had a great view. The windows are double paned and filter out the traffic noise. The only noise issues was one night some little kid down the hall was having a tantrum. The rooms are very clean and comfortable and the bathrooms are large for European standards. The staff is very friendly. Never had any problems with housekeeping at all. If you get a room on the 2nd level you might be able to get free wireless leaking up from the lobby. Otherwise, there is free wireless in the lobby. There's a nice little seating area with a large screen tv and some books that has wireless internet. Las Ramblas is about a 10 minute walk and Sagrada Familia is about a 5 minute walk. We only rode the metro once, mainly just to ride it. Skip the provided breakfast. There's a great bakery and supermarket literally half a block away. We bought stuff there and ate in our room or in the park. There's also a nice 24 hour locals place a few doors down that is part bar/restaurant.", "Date": "September 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bournemouth, England", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed our stay\u201d", "Author": "dereks9658", "ReviewID": "UR3904456", "Content": "We spent 3 nights at this hotel and enjoyed them all.

The location is good, just 5 minutes walk from Sagrada Familia and about 20 minutes walk from La Rambla. If you don't fancy the walk, the Tube is a cheap and easy option. The Hotel staff were helpful and multi lingual, and they'll stoore your bags for you if you arrive too early or if your flights quite a few hours after check-out. It's convienient for the airports, with our taxi from Barcelona airport costing just over 20 euros.
