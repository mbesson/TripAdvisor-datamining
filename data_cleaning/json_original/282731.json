We arrived and was checked in by a very nice lady who spoke good English. We were given our room key and proceeded to our suite. When I walked in, I noticed that there was not kitchen in the suite which is what I had asked for, so I went down to reception and stated that I had booked that specific suite for the kitchen so I could make my children breakfast in the morning as I wasn't pay the 17\u20ac each that the hotel wanted in their restaurant. I was told that some suites have kitchens some dont and that they were fully booked for the period of our stay, so when I then asked for my money back and we'd go elsewhere, they funnily enough found us another suite accross the corridor! But we were told that the cooker and hob would not work! This suite was nice, had 2 rooms a kitchen and a bathroom. On further inspection of the kitchen there was not a utensil or piece of crockery insight! So we had to go to the little arcade down the street and buy plastic bowls, spoons, knives and forks so we could make our children food in the morning!

The hotel was nice and clean. The room was very open and large. The location was great there were a U-bahn stop close by, with a mall that had a grocery store and a few restaurants right underneath and around. The front desk staff was very nice and minus one thing was very helpful. I would recommend staying here if you have a family, or if you have a need for lots of space. It was great to have a room that my family and I were not standing on top of each other. Now for the few things that need to be improved. We shipped out luggage to the hotel before we arrived. We called the hotel to ensure that they would accept the luggage before we checked in. When we arrived in the mid afternoon, I asked about our luggage and told it wasn\u2019t there. Not worried yet as the delivery company still had time. Dropped our backpacks in the room and went for a walk to see the area. We came back and asked again still no. Now I\u2019m worried. So we went to the room and cleaned up and checked on line for the status. According to the shipper he had arrived and been delivered around noon that day. So we went back down and asked for the third time. They went back and hunted for it and finally found our luggage. The staff was nice about it and apologized, but still having to go and ask three different times when it was there the whole time was a bit taxing. The other issue for our room was the balcony. Or lack of access to it. When we got there we went to the room and saw the door for the balcony. One of the main reasons we booked here was the balcony. We are early risers and wanted to be able to talk and have coffee without waking our son. Our reservation said the room had a balcony. We went to the balcony door and there was no door handle. When we asked the hotel about it, they told us sorry that room doesn\u2019t have one. No offer to move us, not explanation as to why just tough luck. We didn\u2019t push the issue as we were tiered from travel and had just gotten our luggage. (See above). All and all this was a great hotel, just a few things to make it outstanding. If we go to Berlin again we will consider staying here.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cVery good value for money - but internet a real issue\u201d", "Author": "stephantravel", "ReviewID": "UR126096967", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel twice last year.

I very much appreciated the fact they accepted to give me late checkout without even hesitating (and I am not a goldcard holder or anything like that with Ramada). The only major issue I had was the wireless connection not working properly. It seems that, the farther away from reception you are, the weaker the wireless signal, to the extent that you won't have any if you are in one of the rooms towards the end of the corridor.

(10 euros to use a swimming pool for an hour or so is, i think, very steep) Also, under 18 year olds are not allowed in! The breakfast was soooo good! They had such a big choice! The only thing that wasn't very good in the breakfast department is one of the women clearing the tables etc. who was being unfairly rude to us (her name was Chantal M. ). Around the hotel there are a few restaurants (I recommend the Italian one, San Marino), caf\u00e9s, a couple of small supermarkets, a petrol station and, most importantly, just around the corner there is a U-Bahnhof (an underground station) which is very very useful if you want to go into the center of Berlin.

It's part of a new complex which also includes cafe's, a bakery, a deli, and a Aldi store (excellent for cheap snacks, toiletries and bottled water etc). It's also adjacent to a wholefoods store, and a Japanese canteen style restauraunt. There is a 24/7 Shell garage/store at the U-Bahn entrance on the corner also. Nearby public transport brings you everywhere you would want to go. The staff were efficient, if not over friendly (common enough in Germany, and not meant as any slight - everything is just businesslike), while the rooms were spacious and generally spotless. The downpoints for me were first and foremost, the beds. Both mornings of my stay I found myself in horrible pain. The matresses were like concrete slabs, and the pillows (which look soft, fluffly and inviting) collapse at the merest touch of your head and feel like you are resting on a bag of potatoes. So much thought has gone into the creation of this hotel and the decor - but comfortable bedding is something any hotel worth it's salt should have sorted out before opening. I've slept in more comfortable beds in basic chains like Travelodge previously..so a 4* Ramada Plaza surely should surpass their level of comfort. A final criticism was that the hotel tried to bill me for my stay upon check-out, despite the fact that I had pre-paid for my stay when booking. I do dislike when that happens because it makes the hotel look a little unorganised and unprofessional, and it leaves you with a lingering worry that 4/5 days down the line you're going to see a bill on your card for something that was already paid for.

When I called the Ramada Plaza to tell them that the substitute hotel was unacceptable, they simply told me that there was nothing they could do as that was the last room in all of Berlin that they could find for us. While the staff at Ramada was very nice about helping us and paid the taxi ride to the next hotel, I find it unacceptable that the Ramada Plaza overbooked its rooms in the first place.", "Date": "July 20, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampshire, England", "Title": "\u201cimpressive\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1668413", "Content": "The hotel staff upon arrival were so polite, their english, luckily for us, was brilliant. They were helpful, showing us places of interest on a map and how to get there etc. The room was lovely, it was spacious, clean, everything we could possibly need. Although we had to be out of the hotel by 11 the next day, we had all day until our flight and the hotel allowed us to keep our luggage there until we needed to leave for the airport. so we had a luggage free walk around town.
