Like all hotels It has it's pro's and con's which I'll try to list, but I think this was a great choice. Pro's 3 to 5 blocks to the heart of Downtown. Great alternative hotle for those meetings at the Sheraton or Hyatt. Nice Pool and Jacuzzi area. Rooms are clean and have plenty of room. Fridge and Microwave in each room. Decent free breakfast. The regular HIE fare, but the hostess keeps it freah and clean. Convenient to Ceiy Center Mall area. Several good restaurants in City Center. A few neat/unique place north of the Hotel too. Cons The hotel is over priced for what you get. The hotel keeps prices close to the Hyatt, Sheraton, Hilton $$ range. They get it because they keep the place neat, tidy and supply a free breakfast and have free parking. No managers welcome package. No beer/wine available at the hotel or take-out nearby. I usually stay at an HIE or Staybridge so I can have a glass of wine and cigar at the pool in the evenings.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cCould have been much better than it was...\u201d", "Author": "Drinab", "ReviewID": "UR127369819", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for two nights. It is a very nice facility. The rooms are extremely clean and very pretty. The lobby is also very nice. A free continental breakfast is available and the menu was not exactly the same the two mornings that I was at the hotel. My biggest complaint was the customer service upon checking into the hotel. It was around 10 o'clock at night when we checked in. Our reservations had been made several weeks prior to our visit and I had confirmed all of our arrangements. When we arrived, there was one person ahead of checking in and only one clerk available to assist everyone. That wasn't a problem, it was kind of late at night and it made sense that there wouldn't be a whole lot of people around to help. When our turn came, I gave the clerk our information. Originally we were supposed to only stay one night and at the last minute we had to add on another night so we had two confirmation numbers. I explained this to the clerk and she insisted that they only had a reservation for one night. She became really snippy with me and kept insisting that there wasn't a second night reserved for us. I reiterated that I had two confirmation numbers two more times. On the third time she finally listened to what I had been telling her. Then she asked for my credit card to keep on file. I understand that this is standard procedure in any hotel in case that any extra charges are made to the room. I explained that our room was being paid for by an outside company and that they had already provided a credit card and I had been told that I wouldn't need to provide one again. She insisted and became snippy with me a second time. In the interest of time I handed over my credit card. She told me that it wasn't a credit card that it was a debit card and I explained again that it was a credit card (that's why the Visa logo is on the card) and she became even snippier. Finally we had our key and were on our way up to the room. Upon entering the room I discovered another problem. We were supposed to have a room with two queen beds as I was traveling with my father. During the check in process I was never told that we had been \"upgraded\" to a room with a king bed. We needed a room with two beds so as tired as we were headed back down to the lobby to change rooms. Someone else had arrived so we had to wait again. Finally our turn came and we were told that there weren't any other rooms available, the hotel was full. I don't understand, our reservation was for a room with two beds...what happened to our room? I had printed out our reservation and it clearly stated that we had a room with two beds. Why was it changed? She couldn't explain why and at that point it didn't really matter as there wasn't another room available for us. She said that all she could do was offer a roll away bed. We didn't have a choice so we accepted her offer. The kicker was that she said it would take her some time to get it to us as she was the only one on duty. It was now about 10:45 at night. We went back to the room and within 15-20 minutes the roll away bed was delivered. Luckily, it fit in the room. I never raised my voice and I didn't lower myself to her standards and become snippy with her as she had become with me on several occasions that night, but she could tell I was upset because about 5 minutes after the bed was delivered she was back with a \"treat\" bag. The bag contained chips, cookies, and water. That was nice of her and unnecessary as I am assuming that room mix up wasn't exactly her fault. The roll away bed was very lumpy and uncomfortable. The next day we were switched to a suite with two beds and the staff that we interacted with was much nicer and super friendly. That first night put a really bad taste in my mouth though. I know that I was tired from traveling, but honestly, there is no reason to get snippy with your guests especially when they haven't done anything to you. I'm not sure if I would stay there again.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albuquerque, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cHummmm theres better hotels out there\u201d", "Author": "shan g", "ReviewID": "UR127159507", "Content": "Room was fine but I had to sleep on the pull out couch..
