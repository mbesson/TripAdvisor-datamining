Then we were pretty disappointed by the calibre of the rooms, a poor breakfast offering and dated and musty smelling corridors. However, the location was ideal for our purposes, so informed by our first experience and by other trip advisor tips, we deliberately booked a king suite with an ocean view. Fortunately we were able to secure a relatively reasonable deal through Accor as the rates at this hotel are very high, even by Sydney standards. On arrival, I asked if we could have a room on one of the high floors (as advised in tips in trip advisor) however the young woman at the reception desk said \u201cyou\u2019ve already been upgraded to an ocean view room, on the third floor\u201d. I explained that we had already booked and paid for an ocean view room, but she was convinced that we had been upgraded. How peculiar, but we were too tired to argue. And our ocean view suite was certainly one of the poorest, so perhaps this is where \u201cupgraded\u201d people get sent to! This was disappointing. Enclosed parts of the hotel smelled very odd, and our room smelled so dank and mouldy that that first thing we did was open the French doors to get some fresh air in. The smell appeared to be coming from the air-conditioning and was unbearable, so we slept with the windows open, a bit of a problem on Friday night as the locals partied on through to the early morning of a beautiful night, not far from where our windows were. When we got home we had to wash everything, including clothing that hadn\u2019t been worn, to get rid of the smell. The 2 old televisions would have been disappointing to someone who wanted to watch something too. Current major renovations have spoiled the pool outlook, but I assume that this will improve. On the positive side: the view was stunning! The bathroom was much cleaner and less run down than the room we had on our prior visit, the bed much better, clean crisp linen (although still a bit monastic with only 3 smallish pillows for a king sized bed). The newspapers were delivered each morning even though we hadn\u2019t booked them, the reverse of our previous visit. And this time we weren\u2019t woken at 8 am every morning (including Sunday) by room service who wanted to clean our room. In fact, they only ever came after we had left the room and we had put on the relevant sign on the door. Again, this was the positive reverse of our previous visit. Breakfast was vastly improved, and so we ate there for 3 mornings. There was an ample supply of hot and cold food and although I wasn\u2019t tempted by the scrambled eggs after my last experience, the other food was fine. The continental servings were excellent with plenty of choices of breakfast cereals, muesli, breads, pastries, fruits and so on. The bar service was friendly, although our bar man had to look up how to make a dry martini, good grief! And it came without olives or lime, very odd, but it was cold and well mixed (albeit expensive for so called happy hour, hmm ). The staff were all friendly, polite and helpful and the reception desk staff were exemplary when we were checking out, being efficient and helpful, offering to book taxis, assist with baggage etc. this hadn\u2019t happened on our previous visit. Such a pity that his hotel has potentially so much to offer (and is expensive) and is let down by old furnishings and furniture etc. Get rid of the smelly brown carpets, the old stained (and greasy) brown soft furnishing and old lounges and simply put fresh paint throughout it would be major improvement at once.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cgo stay there yourself\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR126112435", "Content": "stay away if you can... it is worth the $20 cab ride to into the beach to avoid this hotel. the location is amazing it is such a shame that the hotel rests is hat on this feature only. lets hope the new development will dramatically improve on this.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Town", "Title": "\u201cthis puts fawlty towers to shame\u201d", "Author": "23041972", "ReviewID": "UR126036131", "Content": "I stayed there over New year and all that comes to mind is TIRED, SHODDY and OLD!

I have stayed at far better hotels than this for much less. The room was shabby, with very worn carpet, broken mirror frame in the bathroom, broken soap dispenser in the shower which was old and mildewy, with bits of different coloured silicone from various patch up jobs over the years. Small bath, no exhaust fan, tilting towel rack, grubby grouting. Old 80's furniture that wouldn't be out of place in Vinnies, and the tiniest, crappiest, oldest TVs I have ever seen. While reading the Fire safety brochure about the fire rating of the doors, I couldn't help but notice the 30mm gap under the door that lead to the hall. Whilst a fire would have meant early retirement for this dilapidated building it didn't eventuate and no smoke poured in under the door, just all the sounds from the rest of the floor. Special mention goes to the toilet seat... the plastic seat was stained and delaminating particularly at the back in the middle from years of alternately being soiled then bleached. I worked out why when I sat (contemplated the hover) on it and discovered it is really quite small, I can only imagine how it came to be so soiled at the back... On a plus side, the room was very reminiscent of one I stayed in back in 1992 in Bangkok, bringing fond memories, At least that hotel was rated at 2 star, not the supposed 4.5 star rating of this pile, and that was '92!

This hotel is expensive, but in comparison to the other accommodation available at bondi beach, it's cheap at the price!! Yes it's old and dated and is really in need of an overhaul, but the location and staff are fantastic. We had initially booked a self catering apartment in bondi beach for our stay which was only a few dollars cheaper a night, we certainly learned our lesson, it was dark, dugusting, dirty, cramped and nothing like the website pictures. We had to leave it and were so glad to book into the swiss grand. We able to go to our room at 11am, as with the previous reviewer we have a baby so this made things so much easier for us. We were happily splashing around in the outdoor pool by midday. It would appear that the hotel is going to be changed to appartments, ( I could be wrong about that) so the emphasis seems to be in maintaining the hotel at it's existing physical standard, rather than improving it.

All the staff we encountered were fantastic but at the end of the day if a customer is paying CBD prices and having to sleep with windows wide open to get rid of mould smells then they will feel ripped off. The hotel has the general feel that management have forgotten about it as all their energies seem to be on promoting the first apartment that has been built at side of property. Even the boardwalk to the new apartment has a temporary wall that blocks out the beach views from the rooftop pool, This wall could easily have been lower so people sitting on the sunlounges could look at Bondi beach, instead you look at a white wall. The top deck area is very unloved and neglected , how nice would it be to sit by pool, have a drink and something to eat looking at Bondi beach , but there are no menus and to order anything you have to go back inside to phone room service, no one ever does.

Ok, where to start, I think all the previous reviews say it all! It was glaringly obvious that it was a step down in standard as we had only hours before left the Parkroyal in Darling Harbour and it was disappointing to see the state this hotel is in. We have stayed here many years ago and enjoyed our stay at that time. If we had not booked the rooms through one of Accor's half-price specials (which mind you was still more expensive than what we paid at the Parkroyal) I would have been very unhappy. We were pleased we only stayed for one night. The reception staff, with the exception of one male staff member, were very cold and unhelpful. After check-in, a bottle of wine was delivered to the room as a welcome back gesture, which was a nice touch. However, rooms were very poorly maintained, all tap fittings were loose, the shower in one room began to drip at quite a rate in the early evening and while there was prompt attention from staff after we complained about it, it did result in us being moved to a different and upgraded room. The service and assistance at that point in time was exceptional. In particular the service we received from the young gentleman who we think was the duty manager was great. The upgraded looked in slightly better condition, it was ocean view and there was a flat screen TV in the bedroom; however the lounge room still contained the older style tube TV. Rooms are very poorly insulated from street noise and loud vehicle noises were quite noticable and annoying considering the standard of the hotel. Lounges in the lobby were all very worn and stained. Paint was bubbling and peeling in many areas of the lobby and open areas of the hotel and in the room. We paid for breakfast, which was disappointing in itself, very limited selection, drab and dark looking restaurant with what appeared to be milk stains on the front of the hot buffet. Crooked picture frames that no one seemed to have noticed. Pool area looked like a construction site, not sure what they were trying to do.

Even on the busiest mornings for breakfast there is one person helping in the dining room. The other signs of the hotel doing things on the cheap; the napkins are the single layer tiny useless type; the cleaning of the rooms are not to top standard so the hallways are not been dusted; there really isn't any soap in the shower but the cheaper bottle type attached to the wall which also is suppose to be shampoo and conditioner which it definitely is not; and the smaller bottles on the basin are being filled by this cheaper soap product from the shower - yuk.

We attended for a wedding and its location suited us. Positives: I can say upon arriving that the hotel is situated in a great place and right across from the iconic Bondi Beach. Our room was clean, large and had a great view of the beach. The bed was also very comfortable. Negatives:, This hotel is significantly over priced. Even though our room was clean it was old out-dated and generally poorly furnished \u2013 as is the hotel. The bathroom is old and in significant need of renovation. Our air conditioning did not work and when we put it on upon returning to the room, the room filled with the smell of electrical smoke. We had to immediately turn it off. The room was meant to have a balcony but the balcony would have been thirty centimetres deep meaning you could not sit outside to enjoy the fabulous views (which is why I upgraded!). Additionally there are no fly screens on the doors, so if you want to open the room up to enjoy the sea breeze you need to sleep with the doors completely open. This meant we had an uncomfortable night sleep in a warm hotel room, as I was not comfortable leaving the balcony doors wide open all night and the air conditioning did not work. Additionally to this I was advised by another guest staying at the hotel who was attending the same event as I did, that although they booked a junior suite they had been upgraded to a better room, which was far superior to ours. Normally I would not have minded this (luck of the draw) but for approximately 400 per night you expect a quality you just don\u2019t get. The breakfast was not great either, it\u2019s probably the worst buffet breakfast I have had. Overall: I would not recommend this hotel.

We have stayed in the hotel before and were very happy. However we were not told that the building has been sold and will be torn down. This was very evident even after our 27 hr flight with little sleep. The wether was fantastic so we decided to walk through to the outside area. What a mess that was. No time or energy had been spent on the outside the tables and chairs where filthy and ashtrays where full of cigarette butts. The bar was dysfunctional, the fountain was also the same. Talking to reception re outside area we where told it was fully functional and to make contact with a staff member who would clean the area for us. She had obviously never been out there. The reception staff were also dismissive and clearly unhappy. The room we were allocated was ready for us which was great as we had come to the hotel 2 hrs early and we were also extremely tired. We ultimately entered the 80's again, after spending $300 which was the most expensive hotel in our travels this was not what we where expecting. Bondi Beach is not the Best location in Sydney and is now at its worst since i have been visiting in 5 years. The noise from the street was annoying also. Arguing and traffic were the main noises and this was a Monday night. We were offered a new room but would be charged another $100 to relocate. What for. There were no amenities at the hotel. No gym, no pool access, no spa bath, no room service, etc. We now relocated to Manly and paid 30 dollars more to have an amazing ocean view, peaceful nights sleep, great food, great bed, room service, modern room, all amenities, and no old folks home smell. Only negative thing is stay in SwissGrand has made us feel very upset that we did not come straight to Manly. Do Not book this hotel.

You don't expect mould around the shower base, single glazing which doesn't keep out that much noise, the bottom of the door in the bathroom to be rusted and corroded and curtains in the bedroom that are 3\" too short etc. As we were so tired we stuck it for 2 days before being upgraded to a \"newly refurbished room\". This wasn't much better, but at least had a great view of Bondi beach. This room had a damaged sink, dirty panels in the bathroom, dirty sliding doors onto the balcony, damaged/swollen leg on the desk, phone not working etc etc. DON'T even go near the outside pool as I dread to think when the beds and tables were last cleaned. Only 3 matresses for the sunbeds, damaged security wiring, wooden furniture you didn't want to sit on, pool bar damaged and not maned. This hotel is not value for money, the only thing is a good view from the ocean view rooms. It is very tired and has not had money spent on it for years. As with other reviewers I would rate this at 3* at the best,with the rooms being well below this. The duty manager was initially OK, but when we decided to get out and book into a proper 4* hotel in Sydney.

The hotel is an absolute disgrace to say the least. I would not even rate the hotel 2 stars as I have stayed at better, cleaner and more efficient back packers. This weekend Sydney experienced a bit of rain, I am talking a normal amount of rain- no storms or severe weather. To my horror a large piece of plasterboard approx 3m long fell off the ceiling FIVE stories on to the lobby floors where people sit. Had someone been sitting underneath they could have definitely been seriously injured or killed!!! There were catering containers and towels scattered all around the lobby floor where the roof was leaking to catch the water. This is the LOBBY of a 4.5 star hotel!!! When given attitude by a man at the desk who rolled his eyes at my partner as our parking ticket did not work and we were stuck in the parking, my partner brought up the disgraceful state of the lobby. To which he was told that there were 'no issues, just a few leaks'. That afternoon another massive plaster molding fell five stories onto the lobby. The area was not marked off properly and again had someone been underneath there- they would have been injured or killed. By that stage people were angry and talking to the girl at the desk.. who handled the situation very unproffessionally. Another hotel guest confronted her saying that the entire lobby should be sectioned off as someone will get killed!.. They then put some tape around the lobby. The next morning half the tape was taken away and there was nothing to stop more moldings in the other areas from falling. You should have seen people's faced when they walked in to the hotel to check in and they were greeted with caution tape, buckets and towels all around the lobby. Clearly Accor do not want to put any money into this hotel as they have been talking about a refurbishment for years now. I don't know what it will take, but i suspect a serious injury or even death. On top of these issues, the rooms were old, couches stained and smelly, bedlinen not of 4.5 star quality, the toilets don't flush properly. The bar was filthy (couches disgustingly dirty) and I noticed chips on the floor that were not cleaned up within the 4 days that we stayed there. I ordered a drink only to receive it in a filthy filthy cup. There was no way we were going to try the hotel food after that. One of lifts was broken for a few hours and they had a staff member stand there holding a button for it to work. The buttons were then masking taped back together!

I confirmed verbally 2 to 3 times over the phone that this is what I wanted (the call centre operator had difficulty understanding english), however it was confirmed verbally each time that we were receiving everything in the \"hot deal\".

The variety and quality of food was very poor. In the end it was a blessing in disguise that dinner was not included in our package because breakfast was so terrible. To top things off, they advertise a pool on their website. I have a 5 yr old who loves swimming no matter how cold - the pool it was absolutely filthy. Very disappointing, they should advertise that the pool is not usable in winter. All I heard for the rest of the weekend is - \"can I go swimming in the pool?, the pool in Melbourne was better\".

But for location, views and excellent roof-top facilities its great. I stayed there for nearly 3 weeks in November, after spending over 2 weeks in the Swissotel in Sydney CBD. I am posting this review (late) because I want to add a slightly different perspective to the reviews written below. My expenses were paid for by work, so I could stay pretty much wherever I wanted in Sydney. The slick modern functional Swissotel in Market Street was boring me to death, so I transferred to the Swiss Grand in Bondi. Yes, the decor is a bit faded, and (oddly) it has no restaurant. Yes, it was very understaffed (at one point I think the duty-manager was acting as receptionist porter, telephone operator and security all at the same time). But hey, when you stay there, you have BONDI BEACH on your front doorstep !!! It's a three minute trot to the water's edge, so you can get a couple of hours surfing or swimming or snorkelling in every day either before or after work; you can do yoga and all kind of outdoor exercise classes on the beach, there is a great surf shop (Dripping Wet) just out front, and the hotel are happy to keep your surfboards in the porters room on the ground floor; there is fantastic food and nightlife on Campbell Parade right outside the front door; the hotel has a great roof-top pool and heated jacuzzi with great views, and its an easy 30 minutes trip to the Sydney central business district by bus, train or taxi. My room was clean, large, with a separate sofa/lounge area and a little sink/fridge/kitchen type area (no cooker). The bed was huge and extremely comfortable. The air-con was super-efficient (it was pretty hot in November). The room was mostly quiet, but in the lounge area i could sometimes hear next door's TV through the connecting door, but I couldn't hear it in the bedroom. The hotel does seem to host a lot of weddings, so you might pass occasional gaggles of revellers in the corridors, but i never heard any party-noise in the late hours. Hotel guests have full use of the independent fitness centre and pool in the basement, its a bit dank and windowless down there compared to the outdoor roof-top pool, but the gym staff are very friendly and helpful. Bondi beach just has the most amazing exhilerating vibe, so if you are in Sydney for business, and you are fed up with the thought of staying in yet another boring city centre hotel, you could do worse than trying the Swiss Grand in Bondi - just don't expect it to be the Sheraton !", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cVery old place that doesn't live up to the expectations - be aware of that\u201d", "Author": "grmblzmpf", "ReviewID": "UR63208819", "Content": "Currently staying here for a conference and two more weekend nights afterwards. I have to say - the hotel doesn't live up to the expectation they create. We have booked a junior suite. The first room we got was rundown, extremely old furniture, carpets that was mouldy in the corners and a mouldy smell. I complained and got first offered an upgrade to refurbished room for 60 AUD per night. Not on - I'm not the person to throw more money after a bad decision. I asked to speak with the manager who then showed me another junior suite - better (not as quite as rundown and leaving a slightly better impression, but still very old, seasoned fittings and not anywhere near a 4.5 (that's what the hotel claims to have) star experience) so I moved floors into the new one. We went to dinner, came back and I had a random glance at the pool towels in the new room - both dirty with stains, even found a few hairs in one of the towels. That was it, I went down to reception again (10:30 pm) and demanded a solution. The night manager first offered fresh towels (wow) and a free breakfast but after telling him in very clear words that could not be misunderstood what type of poor impression the hotel has left me with within 3.5 hrs staying here, we in the end got another room, this time an ocean view suite. I'm in this room now and it's much better. It's in fact the first room in this hotel I've seen that can claim to be a 4 or 4.5 star room with a decent, clean and inviting appearance. It's massive in size (way too large for us), but if that's what it takes to get what the hotel claims, it's unfortunate for them that it had to come that far. In the end, it seems that the problems are solved now (for now) - good on them for trying and finding a solution in the end. I don't want to put anyone off staying here, but be aware that you're paying a very high price for (mostly) very old, seasoned rooms that are not at all in great condition. I would give the rooms we first stayed in a max. of 2.5 or 3 stars. Obviously Bondi Beach adds a premium for the location. The \"rack rate\" for the junior suite we originally booked is apparently 500ish AUD per night, the current price on common booking sites is about 200-220 AUD per night. For that money you can get a true 4.5 or 5 star experience in a lot of places in Sydney downtown.

Our room was fantastic,what a view. We were on the fifth floor over looking Bondi beach. Our room was very spacious and clean,with a king sized bed. We rang housekeeping for more pillows and they prompty arrived with two more pillows. More than i can say for the people that should have come to fix our safe.

Having passports,and valuable items we wanted some where secure. Which wasnt to be. We didnt even bother saying anything about the door not closing on the shower,which left us skating about the bathroom if we didnt put towels down. There is a bar just underneath our room which was lively on a couple of occasions,as we had double glazing and secondry glazing it didnt bother us too much. Other people in the hotel letting there doors slam was a pain. For information, the conieirge was brilliant. He even gave us a map of Sydney. You also get your beach towels from him. The transport system in Sydney is excellant. Buy a 3, 5 or 7 day bus/ferry ticket from the convience store nearby. Really good value. The best bus to catch is 333 a two minute walk down the road. It takes approx 40mins to get into the city. We only had breakfast in the hotel,it didnt appear that there was any other meal available. There was plenty of choice with breakfast. Along bondi is a endless choice of resturants,we felt the steak house next door was expensive,compared to a meal you can get on Sydney Harbour for a similar price but better qulaitiy.

The lobby in fact the whole hotel is tired, dated, old fashioned, grubby in places and utterly worn out which is unfortunate. It is busy and thriving and plenty of couples and families are staying here but that is probably because there are so very few hotels in the middle price bracket on Bondi. It is rated as a 4* by British Standards and it most certainly isn't. It has large rooms which in their day were probably very good and in fairness they provide space, and plenty of amenities. There is a large sleeping area with very large windows overlooking the beach if you get an ocean view with nets and blackouts and curtains, Double windows so noise isn't a problem. The carpets are old and grubby in places. The furnishings seem to be 1950's orthereabouts, really dated and old fashioned and boring. There is a sink in the bedroom, a small wardrobe, a safe, a phone a large bed and mirrors. Next to the bedroom there is a sink and bar area which is tiled opposite is the bathroom which has a large mirror area, bath ours was a spa jacuzzi type, shower and loo. It is reasonably spacious but dated again and grubby in places. Next to this is a small sitting area with a two seat sofa, mirror and then the door out to the corridor. The staff clean it very well but things get to a point where they need replacing because they can't get any cleaner! The crevices of the shower are grimy for instance as is the polyfiller around the fittings. The bed linen is lovely, clean and changed and made up daily if requested. The air conditioning exists but it is poor. On full blast the room doesn't really cool right down. Overall I would say it depends what you like, what you are used to and what you want froma hotel. Hotels can be star rated on their facilities but this doesn't always bear refelction on the overall class/style etc anbd can be misleading. There is a rooftop pool, okay but again dated. We have stayed in other 4 * hotels around the world and this really really does not deserve to call itself one.

Yes it\u2019s a great location, yes the rooms were clean (not exactly something to pat yourself on the back over when you\u2019re a 4.5 star hotel on Bondi Beach) but everything else was awful. To begin with, the rooms are NOT air-conditioned. We stayed on a hot, but by no means unusually hot for a Sydney December night and not a single member of our 30 strong party got a wink of sleep because ALL of our rooms were like saunas (it\u2019s not as if the air-con was simply broken in my room). It was difficult to breathe, much less sleep. Thankfully, the dank, smelly windowless conference room we worked in over the two days had air-con. The entire hotel\u2019s supplies worth. We were in jeans and jumpers, teeth chattering in the conference room, and then stinking, sweaty hot the minute we returned to our rooms. Staff KNEW how dissatisfied we all were and we were offered not a single acknowledgement. We weren\u2019t asking for our money back, but a simple \u201cwe understand that the air conditioning is an issue and we\u2019re working to fix it (or better yet a \u201cour air-con will prevent you from having a single hours sleep so perhaps stay somewhere more comfortable until we can sort ourselves out\u201d PRIOR to booking) wouldn\u2019t have killed management. The breakfast was appalling. The boiled eggs were so overcooked the outside of the yolks were green. Without exception we all refused to eat them. There was no evidence of eggs made to order and the rest of the sludge in the bain maries looked fatty, overcooked and unappetising. The coffee was the worst. It comes from one of those cheap instant espresso machines, and as there is no staff to offer you coffee, you make it yourself. I pushed the button and got CHUNKS of milk in my coffee. The waiter saw my disgust and made me another cup, from the same machine, but did not offer to get me real coffee from the foyer barista, which I later found you could request at an additional charge (something I would gladly have done if I\u2019d only known about it). The entire breakfast was almost retro, in an unimaginative, poorly executed 1980\u2019s way. There did appear to be one waiter trying his best, but he didn\u2019t have much to work with and as far as I could tell, he was the only waiter attending the entire breakfast. The only nice part of the hotel, the outdoor terrace was filthy dirty, in poor repair and unattended by staff. The chairs and tables were cheap and uncomfortable plastic and aluminium covered in bird poo. Thank goodness for the view. The room and hotel d\u00e9cor is tired, which is fine and I understand that it can be difficult to keep the damp smell from soft furnishings in an art deco hotel alongside the ocean but quite seriously, I stayed in older hotels in Havana in Cuba alongside some of the roughest seas on the planet where the soft furnishings smelt less damp and musty. Needless to say the hotel has none of the special, personal touches you can expect from other 4.5 star hotels (turn down service, newspapers, personalised breakfasts, car park attendants, porters etc) To top it all off, about half way through the second day of conference a screeching, deafening grinding started in the stairwell beside our conference room, and it was so loud we were unable to continue the meeting we had specifically booked the hotel for. After 6 (yes, that\u2019s 6) complaints to management about the noise, one of our party went to complain again, only to be given attitude by the concierge. I accept that perhaps emergency works were being conducted (as it could only have been emergency works, there being no other signs of ongoing maintenance) but not to offer to move us, not to follow through with a repeated promise to cut the noise, to give us attitude was just the last straw.

After checking in, he watched as we carried the same bags upstairs to our suite. The central atrium absolutely reeks of food - we actually agreed it smelled of stale bacon fat. It was always worse in the mornings but it hung around the entire day and we could even smell it in our room if we didn't keep the doors to our terrace open. The room was spotlessly clean and quite well appointed, but the decore was old and shabby and the spa bath beside the bed kind of took us back to the 70's. Wallpaper and paint were both shabby and the chairs were quite heavily stained. however the bed was very comfortable and the sheets were devine. The tolet was so small we had to try to negotiate the toilet roll holder and slide in beside the toilet itself to get the door shut. Maybe the space given up for the spa bath would have been better utilized as a toilet. The shower had good pressure but the temperature was inconsistent. There was nowhere handy available to hand you towel ready for when you finished your shower. On tthree occasions the bathtowels supplied would not even go around my 34\" waist! The towels all smelled of that \"old laundry\" smell. It was the first time any manager of any hotel has welcomed us to their hotel by sending us two apples. Nice thought but not up to the wine or fruit bowl offered by other hotels. There is no turn-down service. The newspaper we ordered each morning never arrived. Breakfast staff tended to be rude and off-hand but the fod was pretty good. Well, it always is at breakfast isn't it? There was an option to sit indoors or out when weather permitted but you had to hunt for cleant tables 9both inside and out) or clear the plast person dishes yourself. We were intrigued to read a sign on the fire doors which said that nothing was to be placed in front if the fire doors. The sign was directly over a stack of chairs in front of the fire doors in the dining room. On checkout, the cashier argued with me about a $27 mini bar charge. We did not use the mini bar. He then insisted that our room was not pre-paid and I had to produce evidence to prove that it was indeed pre-paid. His response was that some other staff member needed to be more careful with his folios. No apology was offered. He then watched as we humped our bags out to our car and luckily the driver immediately ran to help us. Location - excellent. Value for money - shocking.

A short walk across a road to Bondi beach itself, with million dollar views from most of the rooms (or suites as they are described by the hotel). I say most, because our room had a nice view of a brick wall! The room itself was mildly shabby. It was probably nice 15 years ago, but as the hotel was threatened with redevelopment (now cancelled due to the GFC) it means that a facelift is now overdue. Being realistic though, if you are going to Bondi for a weekend you aren't going to sit in your room, so the biggest positive about this hotel is where it is. No question. It's right in the heart of the strip, so can get a little loud. Location not recommended for shrinking violets! For food, the breakfast (included in our rate) served was pretty good. It's all help yourself buffet style, but food was of a good quality and replenished often. We ate in the Sunset Grill (attached to the hotel) and had a pleasant meal (though not cheap!). The pool area is definitely looking very run down and past it's best, and certainly not heated as stated on the website.

Location: The location was unbeatable, with Bondi Beach just across the road and the many MANY restaurants, cafes and shops just outside our door. There was a bus stop just across the street and we were able to get a bus straight into the heart of Sydney or to the nearby Bondi Junction with it's huge shopping mall. Hotel: The hotel was beautiful from the outside and also had a beautiful multi-storied lobby. There was a little bar/cafe in the lobby and I had every intention of spending some time there, but we just ran out of time - guess we'll have to go back! The rooms were fine. The bedroom was average hotel room size with a huge king sized bed. The little lounge room was very, very small, but just big enough for a single fold-out sofa and a single rollaway for the kids. The best thing to us about the 2 rooms was that it came with 2 TV's - which saved on arguments (not that we spent much time at all watching TV). The decor in the rooms is not modern - but I think it kind of complimented the old-world charm of the beautiful old hotel. We did not have any problem with street noise or noise from other rooms. We did not upgrade to an ocean view and balcony, but I don't think we would have had the time to make use of it if we had anyway. Service: Everyone we spoke to was very pleasant and helpful, we never encountered anyone rude at all. There were 2 small glitches that really didn't bother us, but , in the interest of being thorough, I will mention. On the first night they forgot to deliver a rollaway to our room. By the time we thought about it, it was late, and we decided to not worry about it (the king bed was so big it was no problem to fit 1 adult and 2 kids in it). The next morning I mentioned it and the bed was in our room when we returned that afternoon. The second thing was that on the last morning of our stay our keys quit working at 10 am even though checkout was at 10:30. Again, not a huge deal - just a minor hassle with making a special trip back down to the lobby, standing in line and sorting it out. We saw both of these things as being minor, they did not have a negative impact on our overall stay and they were both rectified quickly once we brought them to someone's attention. Features: Our package included the buffet breakfast each morning, which was very good, with just about any breakfast food you could want. Just off the restaurant there is an outside deck cafe/bar. This deck had a beautiful view over Bondi Beach. It also had a fish pond with several friendly fish which the kids enjoyed. The pool is up on the roof and looked impressive, but we didn't get a chance to use it. As mentioned, the lobby looked like a lovely gathering spot to have a drink or read a book. Value: We got an incredibly good deal that included breakfast and car parking (off-season). We will definitely stay here again some time if we can get a similarly good deal. I understand that it is quite expensive though in the summer. Things to Do: As mentioned, we took the bus to Westfield shopping mall at Bondi Junction for some serious shopping. Another day we took a bus into the city to Circular Quay and caught a ferry across to Luna Park amusement park. That was a really fun family activity that we all enjoyed. Don't expect Disney Land (because it's not) but it is a smaller Coney Island kind of place with plenty to do to fill a few hours. We also went to a rugby league game. We walked along Bondi Beach. We enjoyed wandering along Campbell Parade (the street the hotel is on). We went to a Greek restaurant called Niko's one night (very good), had HUGE slabs of ribs another night from a place called the Hurricane (delicious) and also sampled the pizza, ice cream and some wonderful churros (Mexican pastries) with chocolate dipping sauce - all within a 2 minute walk of the hotel.

Bondi is Bondi, a great beach, great water, sometimes surf and sometimes not, but real beach life.

The rooms are suites (i've stayed twice, both ocean view, don't know about the rooms at the back), sort of, in that the entrance hall is actually a small lounge area. The decor's good and the room's comfortable, with an almost-kitchenette area which is great. The internet's flaky, only works in some of the public areas, not all of them and not in the rooms, and you need to pre-pay for a certain time. It worked, mostly... but to be honest not that well, no more than you'd expect from an internet cafe. Breakfast is good, with an eclectic mix of muesli, congee, bacon'n'eggs, fruit, etc. I haven't eaten apart from that, but why would you when you're surrounded by restaurants?

The first ocean view suite we were shown had decor from a roadside motel in the late 70s. Not just stylistically - it was also worn, chipped and tired. The heating system was an antique - and was not turned on when we arrived so the room was freezing. On rejecting this room, the admittedly helpful staff offered an alternative ocean view executive suite, which apparently goes for over $750 a night. Sure it was larger - but the same problems remained. The only token piece of upgrading was a few cheap flatscreen TVs hung on the wall and a leather lounge that would have looked more at home in a doctor's waiting room. And this was the best they had. We promptly walked out - with the hotel refusing to refund any of our fully-paid room booking - and walked down the road to a small boutique hotel called Ravesi's.

The oceanfront suite we had was large and very modern, with 2 plasma TVs, brown leather sofas and accessories (even in the bathroom), whilst the standard suite was much smaller, with old fashioned decoration and furnishings and 2 normal TVs (the one in the bedroom was in a wardrobe and we didn't see it for a while!).

Although we had to change rooms each night, it was painless enough - Concierge arranged for the luggage to be transferred to the new room and we could get in quickly. We found all of the staff to be very helpful and pleasant. The very big disappointment to us was the noise of the traffic and revellers. Even though there were double glazed patio doors at the front the noise was dreadful, right through to the early hours. I suppose we should have expected this, being in Bondi and in the middle of the backpacking parties! At 3am an ambulance decided to do three lengths of the beach with its siren blaring. The traffic started again at 6.30am, so we didn't get much sleep. Sunday night was a little quieter, though.

Location is great. We didn't bother paying the extra $40 for a seaview room but would recommend this if you are on holiday and it is your first time at Bondi. Parking is free for hotel guests but you have park the car yourself and carry your own luggage. The lobby is nicely decorated. The rooms (suites) are in need of a complete renovation and are poorly designed but this is mainly due to the age of the hotel.

We called on the first day to have it looked at (and again on the second day) but it was still leaking when we checked out despite the hotel advising that it would be fixed. As we were not in the room during the day we don't know if they ever actually sent someone to have a look at it. The first time we called they asked if we would change rooms if the problem wasn't able to be fixed (we said yes) but this never came to fruition. We didn't press the issue though as the mess (although annoying) could be cleaned up easily enough with a towel. 2) Shower was too low to stand under. I am not that tall and the shower only came up to my neck. It would be very difficult to use if you were very tall. 3) Bath towels are extremely thin, old and due for replacement. The food at the restaurant is ok but quite expensive given the quality. Recommend that you venture out as there are plenty of alternatives at your doorstep.
