It is inside an apartment building, so the location has a residential (versus large hotel) feel, and our room, while not large, was comfortable and very clean. The hotel is located close to the Savignyplatz SB stop, making it easy to reach the hotel and to go explore the city. The neighborhood is nice, with a number of good restaurants, and the hotel provides a good cold breakfast each morning, with a selection of meats, cheeses, breads, etc, along with juices, coffee, and tea. From when we first made our reservation to when we departed the service was always prompt and helpful. There are a couple of things to be aware of, though, that could be problematic. First, we didn't find a way to access the hotel, on the first floor (US second floor), using an elevator. This meant having to carry up luggage and a stroller. If you have a lot of luggage, this could be a problem, so check with the hotel first. Second, we did have some noise from the floor above ours. In our case this was someone quite good practicing the piano, but if you are sound sensitive this could make it difficult to sleep. Even though our room faced out onto a major street, we didn't have any problems with street noise, so apparently the insulation around the windows is quite good. Overall, a nice place to stay, especially for the price, and one we would be willing to return to in the future.", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tripoli", "Title": "\u201cwell spend money for accomondation\u201d", "Author": "kathishark", "ReviewID": "UR38954234", "Content": "located near a railway station, we had a nice stay at the hotel am Savignyplatz.

I had a small single room, but it was very clean. The TV had more channels that I was used to, and amenities like a mint on pillow on arrival and a nice, powerful shower and soap. The bathroom was in good shape, and the wood floor was nice. I'm not sure if the hotel is new or if the rooms were just recently renovated, but it is very up to date and clean. Breakfast is also big, with a lot of nice options. A couple small negatives. The staff only speak a small amount of English, but I got by okay with pointing and facial expressions. They are all very nice. It can be noisy at night because of both street noise and noise from the other rooms ... the rooms are close together and it was definitely possible to hear people coming in late at night. No staff is present from 10 on, so you have a key to open the front door and another key to open the door to the hotel, which is up one floor from the ground level. Overall, I had a very nice stay. Good value and amenities for such a location. Also, I don't think many people know about it yet.", "Date": "May 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cork city,ireland", "Title": "\u201cgreat value at the hotel am savignyplatz\u201d", "Author": "katybarry", "ReviewID": "UR6134456", "Content": "we stayed three nights in hotel am savignyplatz on kantstrasse which is five minutes walk from the kudamm, the main thoroughfare of old west berlin.

The hotel is ideal for the budget traveller. It is very reasonably priced, spotlessly clean with spacious rooms and a hearty breakfast that will set a traveller up for the day. The proximity to the S Bahn station at Savignyplatz also allows for speedy travel to other parts of the city. One small quibble is the fact that the walls are thin so noisy guests might be a problem.
