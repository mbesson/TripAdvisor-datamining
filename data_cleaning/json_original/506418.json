After check in, at about 4:15, we proceeded to the bar and lounge for a cocktail and a snack. The room was so crowded we at first could not find a table. When finally seated the noise was so loud and the crush of people so uncomfortable, with people leaning on our table, taking chairs from our table, and generally being unruly, that we had to leave before we even finished what we had ordered. After a long walk on the Embarcadero we returned at about 8:30 to find that the crowd was larger and louder, and a band or DJ had been added to the noise. Unable to enter the lounge we looked for a comfortable place in the lobby, but people had spilled out onto the lobby couches also. The noise in the lobby was as unbearable as it had been earlier in the lounge. I spoke with the front desk about the lack of a place to relax and sit down and it was laughed off with \"It's Friday night and we are always crowded\"! On return to our room we continued to be \"serenaded\" by the DJ for the next couple hours. If the hotel is going to serve as a \"twenty-something\" pick-up bar I would suggest it advise guests before their arrival and also designate a private lounge for use by hotel guests.

Meant to write a review sooner but never got around to it until now. The hotel, the flagship property of the Joie de Vivre group (an overly cheerful name for a hotel chain, I must confess), is located reasonably centrally, by the Ferry building. Although the views from some of the rooms are rather nice, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t crazy about the location. Aside from the Ferry building (which houses a large market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mostly, though not exclusively, food related), there didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be much of interest on the Embarcadero for quite a while. Also, although very close to Market Street (one of San Francisco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main thoroughfares), you have to walk for a good 15 minutes before you get to the shopping area. In my view, both the Four Seasons and the St. Regis, located further down Market Street are better situated. As to the Vitale itself, although designed in a subtle and elegant style, it is starting to show signs of wear. This was evident in both some of the communal areas and the rooms. The Amarericano Bar, in particular, was in dire need of a revamp, with many of its leather lounge chairs sporting unsightly tears. Also, some of the furniture in both rooms we had booked was stained and the carpet had started to fluff visibly. Only ate in-house for breakfast, which was perfectly nice throughout our stay, with a good selection a la carte (no buffet). Also, when the weather allowed it, Americano would host an al fresco aperitif which, although we never managed to attend, seemed quite pleasant. I should also mention that there are two Michelin starred restaurant within a block of the hotel: Boulevard and One Market (I can recommend the latter for the food, which really was rather good and of decent value; as to the atmosphere, the place is so large and busy, and the service so swift, it feels like being in a highly sophisticated fast-food joint). Service was good throughout, though not memorable. To be fair to the hotel, our stay wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very expensive, with an average nightly rate of slightly less than $300 (for Deluxe Waterfront rooms), hence the relatively generous rating. However, if I were to return to San Francisco, I would probably upgrade to a better property.

The other three rooms were view rooms but not as grand as the accessible room. The total price, believe it or not, for the four rooms at the Mark Hopkins was less than the price for four rooms at Vitale, but my parents opted for the Vitale because of its proximity to the Ferry Building and the Bay Bridge. My parents wanted a \"view\" room so they could spend the afternoon in their room enjoying the splendid views before our evening engagement in San Francisco. We checked in a bit before 3:00. All of the rooms but the accessible room were ready to be occupied. My parents agreed to sit with us in our room until theirs was ready, which the woman at the front desk told us would be \"in about 15 minutes\". Just before 4:00 I went to my parents room and found housekeeping still working. At that time we were told it would be a minimum of a half hour before the room was ready. Let's remember that check-in is at 3:00. Since it is dark by about 5:00, my parent's plan of enjoying their \"view\" room was not to be. We went to dinner and returned to the Vitale to have a car drive us to our evening engagement. While waiting for the car to arrive, I pushed my mother in her wheelchair to the Vitale lobby restroom. We had an unfortunately terrible experience in the restroom related to patrons of the Americano restaurant in the Vitale lobby. This story is already MUCH too long. I am not usually one to point out short comings of an establishment, but the treatment we received at the Vitale is the worst we have received anywhere at anytime. The hotel was quite attractive, and the rooms were well equipped and pleasant enough, but the service and attention were exceptionally poor. I believe the hotel should have offered my parents a discount or perhaps even a refund of the cost of their room given the unfortunate set of circumstances. The rooms were VERY quiet for hotel rooms in San Francisco which was a pleasant surprise, and the breakfast we had this morning at the Americano was quite good. We should have kept our reservations at the Mark Hopkins.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat rooms, expensive parking\u201d", "Author": "arnofio", "ReviewID": "UR121880748", "Content": "We found the rooms and hotel very contemporary yet relaxing - the sound system in the room was particularly good.

Room had an iPod player, a nice TV, and a fantastic bathroom. The beds were outrageously comfortable. And the location! Our first night we could walk to the Giants game (about a mile down the Embarcadero--nice walk and seemed perfectly safe, lots of other people walking even on the way back to the hotel) and on Saturday morning we walked right across the street to the Ferry Building to the Farmer's Market and got breakfast there...

We were driving the classic \"mommy\" mini-van and had two kids in the back. There were three valet/bell staff in front engaged in conversation with one another that could not be bothered to open our doors or help with our luggage. After two requests from my friend that they assist (as I hauled the suitcases out of the minivan), we were finally helped. I had already unloaded all the bags. I asked if I \"had to\" check in if we were going sightseeing and they said that we needed to in order to leave the bags. I went to the front desk and gave our last name and they asked for my ID. I have a different last name from my husband and daughter (hardly uncommon these days I would think) and they told me that they could not check me in without my husband's \"permission.\" Thankfully they agreed to hold our luggage without us checking in and luckily my husband's meetings started later than originally anticipated so he came by to \"permit\" us in. I am just glad that I did not have a child that needed to nap or a diaper that needed changing. When we returned later in the day after a long day of sightseeing, I had the same lukewarm experience with the bell staff. The hotel room was beautiful, we had a fantastic view of the bay, ferry building, bridge, etc. The bed was not the most comfortable and my husband had a backache both mornings (he had been at the Four Seasons and Westin previously that both have great beds). The bath products were not replaced after the first night despite the fact that we had used 100% of the conditioner among three people.

It is convenient to the financial district and close to great restaurants in SoMa. You only need to step outside onto the terrace or out the front door to get a fantastic and expansive view of San Francisco. It is just so refreshing to be able to easily access the Embarcadero for a run! The rooms are very comfortable, peaceful and well-sized.

The service was fantastic - room service is quick, the turn down service and housekeeping is impeccable and the front desk and concierge staff are helpful and friendly. The TCHO chocolates and bottled water at turn down are a nice touch, as are amenities like free wi-fi and complimentary coffee / tea in the lobby. Prices for the rooms are also very fair (we got a special on twitter). Room service is like any other hotel, pricy, but the food quality was very good and the service was extremely quick. One small complaint is that the walls are fairly thin - to our chagrin at 3am we were woken to house music playing loudly in the room beside us. However, unlike other hotels in San Francisco that tolerate partying (ahem, W), the staff at the Vitale quickly put an end to this person's nocturnal exploits and allow us to go back to the peacefulness of a comfortable sleep.

The room was clean, peaceful and quiet, no street noise at all. It takes only a few minutes to walk to the Embarcadero Metro stop. Everyone working at the hotel who we came in contact with was very friendly and helpful. One thing that I highly recommend trying is the hotel's spa bath treatment under the stars (well, we didn't see stars as it was fogged in that night) -- candles surround the bath (which is totally screened by bamboo for privacy), rose petals are sprinkled around, and soft music plays while you soak in an infinity bath...the ultimate pampering experience!", "Date": "September 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Danville, California", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best in SF\u201d", "Author": "Ayeletb", "ReviewID": "UR80556402", "Content": "So this hotel has the most amazing beds.

The room was beautiful, equipped with 32\" LCD, auto-blinds, two i-pod docks, great bathroom facilities and adequate wardrobe space. The rest of the hotel is very modern, with superb staff always on hand to help with taxis, info and transfers.

I was most looking forward to this hotel based on the reviews and also the price I doled out to stay here (~$250/night). Upon arrival I was greeted by the modern lobby, as previously mentioned. The location was great as it was close to BART and also the Embarcadero so my commute time to points of interest was short. When checking in, I had to wait 30 minutes for 'my room' while other couples/VIP's who checked in after me were whisked away to their room immediately. I dismissed this as bad luck since it happens to all of us at one point or another during travel. Unfortunately, that was just the first negative experience.... The room I ended up getting was facing the 'garden' which was basically the bottom level of an astro-turf courtyard. So, despite my wait, I got to settle for one of the interior facing rooms with nothing to see :/. The room ended up being very simple and plain. That's not necessarily bad, but for 250 bucks I expected a decent view and at the very least decent amenities within the room. Not so much... The bed was decent and there was good lighting. Unfortunately, the room had a bizarre desk/mini-fridge combo that was literally 1 ft away from the 19\" wall mounted flat screen tv. While this may not seem bad, imagine trying to watch the game where you only have one seating option literally a foot away from the action. It was not ergonomic and it looked like they had designed the room with little thought to living there. The bathroom was well appointed (although it had little water pressure....3rd floor). They also had a nice set of terraces for people to sit on in order to enjoy the bay. In regards to customer service, this place did not project 'boutique hotel'. I ordered takeout (alot of great restaurants in the area) only to realize I didn't have any silverware. I called in to room service request silverware and a plate. It took 1 hour! After I saw my food going cold after 30 minutes I placed a follow up call and was rudely told that with +100 rooms that they couldn't tell me when I would receive my plate/fork. Unbelievable. To make matters worse, with a late flight out of SFO, I asked that they hold my luggage after checkout. I enjoyed the city during the day and came back and inquired if they could help me since I had to change before departure. The front desk would only offer me their bathroom in the lobby. I pleaded to use their spa/locker or even an empty room but they refused. So there I was in their lobby bathroom changing into a suit...Not exactly easy or hygienic. In closing, based on the price point, the poor room layout and the horrible service it leads me to believe this hotel is not worth it. I'm glad other patrons have had a positive experience so I'll leave you with this.... if you have to pay $250/night for a hotel room it should be a sure thing.

DURATION/TIME OF STAY/ PURPOSE: 3 days 2 nights over the 4th of July weekend. Vacation/ getaway and to spend time with family. AMBIANCE: Serine and minimalistic while still being up scale and elegant! HOTEL: The hotel itself is a small boutique hotel. There are 8 floors total. The lobby and hotel bar/restaurant is on the first floor. Second floor has offices and a very small workout room. Floors 3-7 are guest rooms and the 8th floor is the spa. On floors 5, to 8 there are outdoor rooftop spaces with gorgeous views of the city and bay! One of my favorite parts about staying at this hotel was enjoying the view of the Bay Bridge and sunny weather out on the rooftop! SERVICE: For the most part the service was great and the staff was friendly and helpful. The only minor issue was we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t receive turndown service the first night and when we called for turndown they said they would send someone up and no one ever came. I also used the lobby restroom a couple of times and each time at least 1 of the sinks were clogged and it needed service. ROOM: We stayed in a Bay view room on the 4th floor. The room was modern, beautiful, clean and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel cramped. The beds/linens are incredibly luxurious and comfortable and I got a great night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep! I should warn you that there is limited closet/storage space both in the room and in the bathroom. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any dresser and no drawers in the bathroom. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem for us but I can see if you were staying for a longer period of time that it could be an inconvenience. RESTAURANT/IN ROOM DINING: We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at the Americano restaurant but we did have drinks at the bar which was delightful! They also have some self serve coffee/tea in the lobby in the mornings. No coffee machines are in the room. SPA/GYM: Unfortunately I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to visit the spa this time around but I did visit the small gym on the 2nd floor and the YMCA gym across the street which you can get a day pass to as a guest at the Vitale. The small gym on the 2nd floor isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much to look at as it was a small interior room without any windows. 1 treadmill, 1 elliptical, 1 recumbent bike and some free weights. The only reason I used this gym was the YMCA was closed on the 4th of July. It served its purpose but I would recommend going to the YMCA when available. PARKING: Valet parking only. $45/night. Although I suppose you could park your car on the street or in another non-hotel owned location. NOISE LEVEL: I will admit we did hear some knocking sounds from the persons in the room above us but never heard anyone talking and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so distracting that it disturbed our sleep.

I visit San Francisco often for business and have stayed at many hotels around the Embarcadero and Union Square areas - and the Vitale is definitely the nicest!", "Date": "July 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, ON", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location, great views!\u201d", "Author": "cmason971", "ReviewID": "UR69027377", "Content": "My husband stayed at this hotel on our first trip to San Francisco in May 2009. We selected it because of its amazing location right on the edge of the Bay next to the Bay Bridge and all of the amazing landmarks in that area such as the Ferry Building. We stayed in a fantastic Waterfront room with an amazing view from our sitting area right next to the window. The room came with a great bathroom and we loved the contemporary decor. The hotel provided us with some great ambient music CDs to play when we were relaxing in our beautiful room. Having said all of that, there are a few caveats: If you are staying on the waterfront side of the hotel the street noise from the Embarcadero and the hotel's restaurant (which was really good, incidentally) can be a bit much. My husband and I are light sleepers and on vacation we like to nap before having a late dinner. We found this a bit difficult as the Embarcadero tends to be favoured by motorcyclists and people with loud car stereos at around the time that we normally napped. Also, the room we stayed in had a great shower but lacked a bathtub. You have to book an Urban Studio or one of the suites to get a bathtub. After an open-air tour around the bay and over to the ocean cost of San Fran we came back to the hotel chilled to the bone one day and it would have been really great to have a nice hot tub at that moment, but this is a common complaint I have with contemporary hotels, who think that providing a big rainshower-type shower is fine. Maybe for most travelers this is OK but I can't go more than a few days without craving a nice bath! Overall this hotel was great. The service was friendly and accommodating and the rooms were in my opinion really comfortable, nicely decorated and well appointed.

The service here is excellent and by far some of the best service we have had in a hotel in the United States to date. Upon arriving we were given lovely scented hot towels to refresh ourselves and our room was not ready (but we knew check in was at 3pm) so went and grabbed some lunch on the Fisherman's Wharf over the road and headed back at 3pm. We had lunch at The Slanted Door which was delicious and took under 1 hour, the service was perfect but back to the hotel review! Our bags were already in our room so we made our way upstairs in the lift and arrived on the 7th floor. The hotel is modern yet cozy and doesn't have a clinical vibe to it like some modern style hotels do. It has a very green/eco/zen-like feel to it which is just what we like. The whole place smells of essential oils and the lighting is perfect. There was a crd in the room wishing us a Happy Honeymoon and later they bought up a bottle of Champagne which was really quite special of them and completely unexpected. The bed was superb. It has a selection of pillows on so if you like feather or foam you have a choice. The room was adequate sized and the bathroom was okay. The bath however was measly and one thing I did not like was the shower curtain. I never realised hotels still used these however it was quite modern and looked as though it was made of bamboo fabric. The toiletries are fab and the facial soap takes off mascara and I could use it on my face even though I wear contacts. Nothing was too perfumed or harsh unlike a lot of free toiletries you get in hotels. The shower was okay and powerful enough I guess. The location of this hotel is right on the end of the Embarcadero but likely you have a great farmers market opposite and some of the more glamourous outlets on this stretch of road. The further up you go towards the Pier 39 and Ghiradelli Square the more tacky it gets. I guess you are right in the Financial District here to it has quite a bit more class that other areas on the Embarcadero. The bar downstairs is nice and has a well healed crowd of suits most nights. Didn't eat here but I believe room service in the hotel comes from here. We did have breakfast room service one day which was expensive and not worth the money but I was ill and couldn't go out. They have a great selection of pay-per-view movies as I was ill we know they have a free DVD and DVD player service and my husband went downstairs to take to concierge. They said that they don't have many DVDs but if we wanted to pick a Pay per View movie they would take it off the bill for us. Those movies are $12.99 so it was a really kind gesture. We also ordered take away 2 nights and concierge helped us out with that too. They have a service called Waiters on Wheels that deliver from 100's of restaurants in the city. These are NOT affiliated with the hotel however and are an outside service. The hotels service was perfect. I would give it more stars if I could but it seems 5 is the limit. The thing I have to mark it down on is the bathroom which is very small and the bath tub is pathetic. I'm 5'3 and just about fit in it! Also the noise of some of the guests. Some obnoxious guests think it is okay to get out of the lift at 1am and have a conversation with their colleagues for 20 minutes on the landing. This echos down the hall and can be quite loud. Also the banging of the doors in the morning is a bit much as is the chatting in the halls of people with colleagues at 5-8am. Would it kill people to shut the doors quietly? The air conditioning was a little noisy when it kicks in but I think that is much the same in every hotel. I can understand that this is a business hotel mostly so I guess it's going to be a bit noisy like this. I wouldn't stay here again solely based on the noise levels of other guests and the trouble is there is no way the hotel can tell guests to shut the hell up when going up to their rooms and leaving them in the mornings which is a shame because Americans are SO LOUD and it's really inconsiderate towards other guests. My husband however sleeps like a log and didn't hear any of it. This hotel is perfect if you are an early riser say between 6-9:30am as this is when the guests start coming and going however if you like a lie in like me then I would chose something a little quieter. Please don't think the hotel is poor because I have gone on about the noise, this is something completely out of there control but my god it is without a doubt an idilic business hotel and a great hotel if you are going to get up at a sensible time for sightseeing. One other plus point is the hotel has EXCELLENT public transport links. There is a light rail/trolley stop/bus stop/lots of taxis in this area or within 3 mins walk. Perfect really! If you are staying in the hotel I really wouldn't waste your money on one of the bigger rooms. They are RIGHT by the lifts and if I think the noise was bad for me in room 720 these guys would have got it worse in the vista suites with the views of the harbour/bridge and the stand alone bathtubs. All in all this is a solid 4* hotel and I would recommend it for people who aren't lazy and don't want to stay in bed until gone 10:30am.", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dallas, texas", "Title": "\u201cA great place for a tired business traveler\u201d", "Author": "jooles_p", "ReviewID": "UR56721268", "Content": "I really enjoyed my stay at Hotel Vitale.

On arrival, the staff was friendly and professional; it remained so throughout our visit. Although we did not require extensive assistance from the concierge, he provided us very accurate and helpful information on getting around in the city. The hotel is in an ideal location for using San Francisco's excellent public transportation. In fact, one can get from the airport to the hotel (and back) very easily by using the BART and getting off at the Embarcadero Station. The price for this trip is merely $8.10 per person. The walk to the hotel from the BART station takes a little over 5 minutes. Across the street from the hotel is the Ferry Market Building which is a major hub for public transportation to all points in the city. You can buy a pass and get unlimited rides for $6.00 a day. (The passes are sold in the Ferry Market Building.) The hotel bills itself as a \"spa\" hotel and offers various services on its top floor. The prices are what one would expect for the same services in any major metropolitan area. We had reserved a slightly more expensive room with an \"ocean view\" and were not disappointed. The room was large enough to move to accommodate us, our luggage, and could have slept 2 more people on a sleeper sofa in the room. The bathroom was large but did not have a tub. Instead, it had a \"rain shower\" that was comfortable and efficient. At night, we initially had some concerns about the music playing downstairs, but all was quiet by around 10:00 p.m. The beds were very comfortable and the hotel is certainly not stingy about supplying pillows! The restaurant is a tad expensive. We did, however have breakfast there twice and, although there are cheaper places to eat, we must admit that the food was very good. Try the eggs scrambled with truffles - they are delicious. There is a small business center on the second floor of the hotel that has three computers with free internet access for guests. Very handy for checking email, reservations, etc. if you do not want to drag a laptop with you on your trip. The exterior of the hotel is not glamorous - but it is very functional and the staff at the front door very friendly and helpful. Obviously, this hotel cannot compete with the big guys in town as a major convention center, but it appears to work remarkably well for smaller business group meetings and seems to do a brisk business with business travelers. All in all, this was a pleasant surprise and a nice departure from \"industrial hotels\" such as the Hyatt and the Hilton.

They upgraded us, without us even asking, to a waterview room. The staff was so friendly and went out of their way for us. The bell hop brought our bags to our room and after all that we still had time to walk across the street to catch the 12:00 ferry to Sausalito. Could not believe how well that timing worked out. The views from the ferry were magnificent. We stayed in Sausalito for a little bit walking around, soaking in the view and eating lunch. The kids were getting tired, so we caught the ferry back and walked around the ferry building which is filled with different foods and wares and just a great place to visit. We went back to the hotel to rest up a little bit and then off to the Giants game. It was about a 20 minute walk to ATT Park along the Embarcadero. The park is beautiful and the game was great. We walked back to the hotel, as did many others from the game, and felt very safe. The gym at the hotel was nothing to talk about, just a few machines, nothing special. the rooms were very modern and clean and the beds were extremely comfortable. In the morning they had coffee set up in the lobby and it was very comfy to sit around on the couches in the lobby reading the paper. There was a restaurant in the hotel and were going to go there for breakfast, but someone had recommended Mel's Diner on 4th and Mission, so we took a walk over there. The food was delicious and the portions were huge. Each meal cost about $10, but well worth it, considering none of us were hungry till dinner.

All staff were friendly and helpful, and we made good use of the concierge for transport queries and other recommendations. The hotel is right next to the bay, on the edge of the financial district. 15 mins (mainly flat!) walk to Union Square. Start of cable car on Market St is just around the corner. Didn't eat at the hotel (or use the bar, which was always packed.) Only slight negatives were that although the room was on the 5th floor, it was noisy from very early (05.00 ish) in the morning, with road noise, trolley buses etc. Probably didn't wake me up, but made it difficult getting back to sleep. There was very limited cupboard / storage space in the room: no doubt loads of guests are just there for one or two nights, but I'm sure we weren't the first people to have stayed at the beginning of a 2 week trip, and wanting to unpack! Although a \"turndown\" service was mentioned , we didn't get this during our stay. We got a 3 day MUNI Pass (18$) which you can use on cable car, street cars, BART and the trolleybuses. This is great value as one journey on the cable car is $5 and on the buses etc $2. The Ferry building over the road is a gastronomic paradise, with loads of specialist food shops, some restaurants and farmers' markets 4 times a week. Ferry building recommendations: Boulette's Larder for breakfast, excellent burgers at Taylor's Automatic Refresher, good Mexican at Mijita, The Slanted Door - great Vietnamese food. NB Difficult to get in as usually fully booked, but get there at 5 ish and ask if there are any walk ins. (Managed to be first in the line the evening we went!) Mijita was good, but check out closing times! We got there just after 7 one evening,ordered starter and first margarita, went back 10 mins later for more margaritas and main course and the kitchen had closed with no warning given to punters this was about to happen!

Felt very much like a poor person was nickle and diming me to death and that I should pay attention to every piece of written matter in my room lest I inadvertently miss a fee clause in my interaction with it and be levied a surcharge for not bringing my lawyer with me to protect me from the hotel's sad revenue generating sneakiness. This last bit with the $1 that you had to opt-out really ruined my sense that the hotel was a hospitality experience...felt like I was just there to be pumped. Also, don't get the Bay view rooms...they're mostly views of a building across the street and there's a 20-something's lounge on that whole side of the building whose music and drunken expense account partyers you can hear until 1AM. Vitale is located at one of the lowest elevations in San Fran...the sewer drains outside the building often smell of stale sewer. Unfortunately or coincidentally, my bathroom smelled of the same stale sewer, but this may have been a mold problem from the cutout in the glass shower wall intended for turning on the shower, which however also allows a good rain shower on the whole toilet by the end of your shower....go potty before you shower or you'll need to towel off again after using the toilet...which explains the funky smell in there. Oh, and $45 a night for parking.... Watch your back with these people...they'll try to charge for more things that you'd think.", "Date": "June 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh", "Title": "\u201cExcellent service, location and very accommodating with my young kids\u201d", "Author": "nemacolin", "ReviewID": "UR32238439", "Content": "We were originally booked in a room with one bed.

It would be fair to say I know the area very well. I stayed at the Vitale a couple of times three years ago, once in an \"inner courtyard\" room (not so great) and once in a Superior King room overlooking the Embarcadero and bay (very nice). Happened to hit on an unbelieveable rate one day for the Panoramic Suite - nearly 40% off. The Panoramic Suite I would call \"the round room\". These rooms are on the corner of the hotel overlooking Embarcadero and the Bay Bridge, with the infamous bathtub in the bedroom itself. First off, I don't know how you can beat this location while visiting San Francisco unless you are big into shopping and the theater, in which case a room in the Union Square area would be better. The Vitale is right on Embarcadero, and about 1/4 of a block from the Ferry Building which is sort of our local temple of foodie worship. On Saturdays there is a large Farmer's Market as well. A room on the \"water\" side of the hotel makes for some pretty great people watching up and down Embarcadero. No television required. First the good - the room is large, spacious, with very tall ceilings and beautiful picture windows. One would not feel cramped here even after a four or five day stay. The bed is soft and very comfortable - linens luscious. The bathtub in the room, while a very simple tub without the fancy jets etc., is to DIE FOR. I walk by the Vitale all the time and wondered about the privacy issue and when you're up in the room looking out you realize .... no one's looking up from the street! No one cares - they are busy admiring the view of the bay. Once I got in the tub, I followed suit. As noted here in other reviews, shower in the bath is an overhead rainfall type with simple and clean partial glass enclosure. Very classy. Room service - blindingly fast. Breakfast arrived in under 15 minutes. Now the negatives. The noise from the street is pretty intense. Unless you're from NYC or live in the city, this might get to you after a while. This is NOT a quiet and peaceful location. Expect bus and intersection noise to be a factor as early as 6:00 a.m. There was no in room coffee, and I had to call room service for two wine glasses. The toilet was one of the water saver models and simply didn't work. I would stay at the Vitale again but next time would opt for a city view room or there's a side of the hotel that overlooks a small park.

I'll give you a quick summary. First, we booked the week of our stay, requesting a Deluxe City View, which is one step up from a standard room. Since we contacted the hotel directly by phone, we expressed our concerns about noise and they honored that request with a higher-up room facing south (which meant that we had a partial Bay View and could see some of the bridge). The rate was heavily discounted because of the season. After booking, we found a better rate on travelzoo.com and the hotel honored it. The front desk staff, both at check in, and the concierge, are totally on top of their game. At check in the manager on duty who handled our check-in noted our request for a quiet room and gave us the best thing he had, and we were pleased. During our stay, the concierge gave us great advice on nearly restaurants. The housekeeping service pays attention to small details. For example, we brought some bottled water, and they took the extra effort to put it on ice for us. The hotel is clean, modern and updated. It offers free wi-fi in the rooms (at a slower bit rate; faster datastreams cost $10). I'd say it's nicer than a W, but hip in a similar vein. There are multiple roof-top patios with great views -- don't miss them. Things to note: Request a higher floor to avoid noise. Bay View rooms are noisier due to the Embarcadero. City View Rooms don't have much view. Best option is to request north or south facing rooms. The bar is loud and very \"happening\". Don't expect a lot of big hotel amenities --- the gym is small, there is no pool, and there is no cafe (although there is a restaurant, and plenty of food at the Ferry Building across the street.) Parking is really tough in the area. The hotel charges $45 + tax, but you can find nearby garages for less (we kept our car at the Rincon Center a block away). Remember, parking meters start at 7am-6pm, M-Sat. Sunday is free. The Ferry Building across the street has lots to see and eat, but can be overwhelming on Saturdays. Still, it's worth spending time there. If you want to go to the Slanted Door (a hot, pan-Asian restaurant), book ahead.

This was our second try for Hotel Vitale, and we are not sure whether we'll give it another. We were arriving in SF from overseas, and requested a quiet room. Our flight was 8 hours late, so we arrived exhausted. At the front desk we asked if the room was quiet, and was assured that it was. Well, when we opened the door to the room, we were assalted by the bass from the bar downstairs...not even close to quiet. We called downstairs and they showed us a room in the back corner, where it was quiet, but dirty, broken closet doors. The third room we were shown was right on Mission street, and the valet assured us that it would be quite noisy in the morning. Choosing sleep, we opted for the quiet room. The next morning we asked for a better room and for $60 extra (making the room charge over $400) we were moved to a room on a higher floor, remarkably cleaner and with a great view of the Bay. Our take on this hotel is that if you pay the big dollars, the rooms are quiet and clean. If you choose a more inexpensive room, expect it to be noisy and not as clean as you would like it to be. San Francisco is very expensive, but there has to be a hotel where if you pay $300/night, you can expect a clean room and a good nights sleep. Unfortunately, Hotel Vitale is not it. The positives for this hotel are its location and friendly staff.", "Date": "October 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cA little gem perfectly located with awesome views\u201d", "Author": "kelpunk", "ReviewID": "UR21201615", "Content": "In celebrating my husband's birthday, we wanted a quiet get-away weekend while checking out the Fleet Week in San Francisco.

The location is very good and the facilities are fine. But service was just bad, very bad. They try hard, and are personally nice, but really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it right. For the price they charge, the level of service delivered is unacceptable. I have stayed here for 11 nights (tonight is the last night, I am actually posting this from the hotel), so I believe my view is based on a good sample of what happens there, and not on some fluke (positive or negative). Here is a list of what went wrong. You judge for yourself. Day 1: I arrive with my son on July 4th for a 12 day stay. Upon check in I ask whether there is any place in the property where we could see the fireworks and are told \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Next day we go to the 8th floor and see that indeed there was a terrace from where one could see the fireworks. But maybe it was taken for some event. So, we understand. I also notice that despite the fact that we are staying for 12 days, our room has no view (note a bad view, but no view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c windows into a tiny courtyard/service area). Fine, I think, it corresponds to wat I was paying. None of these two events constitute bad service, but they did not build any goodwill with me. Not a problem if things run smoothly. We will see. Day 2: We go for breakfast at Americano, the Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant and arrive at about 8 am, there are two tables already eating and we are the third. We are told to seat wherever we wanted. Service is horrible. It took 10 minutes to get a menu. My son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s order arrives after 10, and mine (two eggs and toast) never come. After he finishes eating, I ask for the check (and then my eggs arrive). I leave without breakfast and decide not to use the restaurant again. In the afternoon we decide to take a cab from the hotel to go to a Jazz Festival. We walk out and I ask the bellman for a cab. He is moving cars, which are parked in front of the hotel. I look at my watch and realize that after standing there for 6 minutes, nobody has even called a cab. So, we walk out, and find a cab for ourselves. Day 3: I call at 6:15am or so and order breakfast in the room, to avoid the restaurant service and to see the Wimbledon final on TV. They say it would be in my room by 6:50. At 6:35 I get a call from Penny saying they are having problems in the kitchen and it will take longer for the breakfast to be ready and that it will be in my room at 7:15. Fine, I say. It does not arrive by 7:15. So, I call the guest service line at 7:20 and Tania \u00e2\u20ac\u201c without checking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c tells me it is on its way. I ask her to check and she says she will call me back. Penny calls me back and says the order will be in my room by 7:30. It arrives at 7:35am. The nice woman who brought it either was not trained to deliver room service (did not offer to open the water bottle, put tray on desk in the wrong way, did not leave cart/table in the room to serve as a table for the two of us to be able to eat, etc) or was in a hurry to do something else. We did not get what we ordered (some toast was missing), but we ate it anyway, as we were starving. Day 4: We order breakfast in the room for two people. They come and deliver a tray without a cart. So, one of us has to have breakfast standing. The person who brought the breakfast told me he could not leave the cart in the room, did not offer to open the bottle of water for me (at this point I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect this level of service anymore), and did not notice that there was only one glass. I called to complain about it, but the second glass arrived 20 min later (we already had eaten breakfast) Day 6: I have to stay a bit later working in the room. At 11 I leave the room, stop by reception and ask them to get my room cleaned. I come back by 2:15 and the room is still not clean. Day 7-Day 11: We basically did not use any hotel services and got used to lousy, sub-standard in room service for breakfast. It is pretty clear that the people delivering the service are just not trained to deliver service corresponding to the hotel rates. Day 11 at night: I knew I might have to take a later flight after checking out, so I went to the front desk during my stay and asked if I could check out at 4 pm (I would be willing to extend my stay for a day if that were not possible). I am told there will be no problem, just to confirm with the front desk the night before departing. So, I just went downstairs and asked if I could have a late check out. They said they are fully committed and I cant. I then ask if I can stay one more day, and they say that I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t (but they would store my luggage for me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they nice?). Anyway, for the price they change this is certainly a sub-standard hotel. I will not come back and do not recommend it. If you will stay in the hotel for one or two nights as part of a leisure trip it is probably OK, but if you will stay for longer or will be in town for business and need good levels of service, probable best to stay away.", "Date": "July 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "SF", "Title": "\u201cHotel Vitale -- very relaxing\u201d", "Author": "jbirkSf", "ReviewID": "UR17416807", "Content": "My wife and I periodically stay in SF and have really enjoyed the Vitale.

Yank Sing, the best Dim Sum in the City is around the corner. Again, the Ferry Plaza has incredible food too. The Slanted Door is infamous and Taylor's hamburgers are a must. Don't scoff, you must try one...Western Bacon Blue Ring is the best hangover cure around. There is a wine shop, cheese shop and a couple of deli style markets that are full time in the plaza. On the weekends, befitting to the epicurian loving locals that flood the market, these places are very busy. You don't need to get into the car during the day, everything is there within walking distance. At night, it is quiet, but it is easy to get a cab to go out to party if that is your scene. We arrived early Friday night and found the patio outside packed with the beautiful people. We assumed right away it was a private party. It ended up that it was just another Friday night at the stylin' bar downstairs. Cool... We didn't hang, but it would have been a great time forsure. We also didn't eat at the hotel restaurant, although the menu did look great. We did have fantastic, fast room service at three in the morning. We had massages together that were outstanding. Before that we did the outdoor bath that was nice. In hindsight though, we spent enough time in our amazing bathtub that we probably could have skipped it.

The hotel was stylish, and the front desk and housekeeping staff were friendly and professional. Our room (deluxe w/Bay view) was clean and well-appointed. The only negative was their valet parking. First of all, they require 20-30 minutes to get your car. Excessive, but considering all of the one way streets in SFO and the fact that their parking lot is at least a block away, I guess that's the best they can do. However, I have a huge problem when I called down for my car 30 minutes in advance of checking out (headed to the airport), and 50 minutes later, the valet shows up with THE WRONG CAR!!! Then, he tried to convince me that it was ours! When we wouldn't take the wrong vehicle, he went back to the garage and came back with the right one. He was apologetic and said they would take the parking charge off our bill. At that point, all we were cared about was getting to the airport on time, so we didn't bother to check on whether he actually did it or not. I suppose I'll find out when I get my credit card statement . . .", "Date": "May 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cWe were very pleased with this lovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "welovetravel22", "ReviewID": "UR15644713", "Content": "We spent a week at Hotel Vitale.

Our room (a king size, bay view) featured soothing colors, natural materials, and even smelled good (not that usual stale hotel smell). The bed had a pristine, white duvet cover. Bedside table has a CD player (with new age-y CD collection) but you can plug your iPod into it. We had a loveseat and arm chair over in the window nook. The bathroom was large, with a glassed-in shower with rainforest shower head. Best of all, the toiletries were made by Fresh and were lovely. The hotel also has 2 roof decks for guest use and a fun restaurant in the lobby - it has an indoor lounge and outdoor terrace that seem to be extremely popular with young businesspeople. The restaurant isn't cheap, but it's worth checking out. We found every staff person we interacted with to be friendly and helpful. In addition to turndown service, a manager came by in the evening to make sure everything was to our liking - a pleasant touch. The location was great for us - right across the street from the Ferry Terminal, where we found a few good restaurants, lots of great snacks (including Cowgirl Creamery for cheese, a great bread store and a wine shop), and an incredible outdoor Farmer's Market twice a week (Tuesday and Saturday). If you're not a walker, the hotel is about 2 blocks from one end of the cablecar line as well as the Embarcadero BART station, and the streetcars go past the hotel as well. We found it a convenient walk to Union Square, the SF Moma, etc., but we really like walking. The only thing we didn't like about the hotel was the supposedly high-speed internet. The free internet service moved at a crawl, whether you were wireless or plugged in. There was also a paid option. But for the amount the room cost, and how little internet costs, they really should provide genuinely high speed connections for free (as they advertise).

I arrived at Oakland International and rode Bart to get to the hotel. I was checked into the room less than one hour after stepping off the plane. Bart cost $6.55 including the $3.00 for the bus transfer from airport to Colosseum Bart Station. The hotel was about three blocks from the Embarcadero Bart Station and is in a modern building. Walking in, the doorman opened the sturdy wooden front door for me and I found my self at the front desk. Check in took about 5 minutes. Halls were moderately dim but tastefully decorated. Rooms are well marked. I was in a King room on the 2nd floor (242) facing Steuart St. The room has commercial grade carpet, a long desk, one office chair, one lounge chair and the king bed. There is an in-room bar and snack tray with unmarked prices that I did not sample. The television is a flat panel above the desk and is about 24 inches with a standard remote and cable. There is a closet that had two bathrobes (soft linen, comfy). A small alcove hid the iron and ironing board. The internet access was both wired and wireless. Either choice was free, just agree to pay $0.00 online, and you were in with pretty speedy web access. I chose wired access as the wireless was unencrypted. There was a much appreciated row of power plugs at the desk level for computer, cell phone etc. The night stand had a stereo-clock radio-MP3-CD player with a docking station probably for an Ipod and a remote control. There was a selection of 5 CD's of music. It mysteriously came on twice by itself during my evening there and required a few minutes of twiddling to turn off. It was on when I came back from dinner, but that time probably from the turn-down service. The bed was comfortable with 4 enormous down pillows. The linens were fine, but the bed was curiously short sheeted--nothing that couldn't be remedied by undoing the meticulous job the maid did before my arrival. Towels were many in the bathroom that had a combination tub shower with shower curtain, sink with reasonably sized counter and toilet. The floor and walls were tiled. There was a can of 90% oxygen in the bathroom. The price for breaking the seal was $69.95! Walls and windows did not keep out the traffic noises either on the street or in the hallway, but I did not hear any neighbors. Twice after 10 PM, I heard trucks doing trash dumpster collecting. Both occasions were loud and lasted about 5-10 minutes. There was a small business center down the hall with three computer stations and a printer, no charge. The fitness center contained three or four machines with individual small TV's. Breakfast in the restaurant was quite good. The prices ranged from about $9 to $19. There was no free option. Check out was painless. My breakfast charge did not make it to the final bill by my checkout, but the clerk promised to email the final bill to me. I have not yet received it after 36 hours, but I am sure that they won't forget to bill me.

My one room service order served promptly, hot and well prepared. A minor complaint that I hope the Hotel Vitale management will consider. The hotel offers free internet service and free it is. Also slow. They offer an upgrade to high speed for $9.95 a day. Charge a little more for the room and throw in the high speed internet and I won't complain.

The morning coffee and a croissant on Saturday morning overlooking the bay and with a view of the Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge was priceless! There are many new restaurants in the area that are highly rated.

This incident occurred on November 10, 2006. The hotel worker in question still works at Vitale, where he continues his racist behaviors towards Black guests under the support of Hotel managers. By Ngugi Wa Thiong'o I checked into Hotel Vitale on Thursday, 9th November in room 640. The following morning, Friday 10th, I went for a brunch and a walk at the water front and then came back into the hotel, at around 1pm, lunch time, took a newspaper, San Francisco Chronicle, at Concierge's desk and went into a nice porch in the Americano, the hotel's restraunt, where I sat and read while also enjoying a nice view of the ferry and waterfront from the window. I was all alone in the porch. A white man, about 5' 4\", dressed in a gray suit stood in front of me. \"This place is for guests of the hotel. You have to leave, \" he said. At first I was intrigued by his words: how did he arrive at the conclusion that I was Not a guest of the hotel? So I asked him: \"How do you know that I am not a guest of the hotel?\" \"You have to leave. This is for guests of the hotel.\" \"But how do you know that I am not a guest?\" I asked him again. \"You have to leave.\" \"But you have not even asked me if I am staying in the hotel\" 'Okay. Are you staying at the hotel?' The tone and demeanor was of a man who had made up his mind that I could not have been a guest. \"Let's us go to the reception desk,\" I told him. \"It is not necessary,\" he said. \"Just leave.\" \"Who are you? What is your name?\" I now asked remembering that the man had not even identified himself. \"It is not necessary,\" He replied curtly. \"Just leave.\" \"This is sheer harassment. You find me reading a newspaper peacefully. You don't identify yourself. You don't ask if I am a guest. And you refuse to identify yourself. And now you afraid of going to the Reception desk? Why? After a few more exchanges, repeating the things, he says: \"Okay, let's go.\" By this time, I am fuming with rage, The man strides towards the reception desk. I also get there and ask the staff to check whether or not I was the occupant of room 640. Even before any of the aghast staff had said anything, the man had started apologizing. But I kept on asking him: How could he do what he did? Find me reading a newspaper that the Concierge had given me, and proceed with such emotional violence on my person? The lobby manager, a David (?) recognized me as the Random House guest, and started apologizing for the behaviour of the man, whom I assumed by now to be the Restaurant Manager, and who by then had had left the scene. No explanation about his conduct. The Lobby manager went to get the Hotel Manager who came down and apologized for what he termed as some misunderstanding. \"But it was not a misunderstanding,\" I said. \"I was quietly reading a newspaper when he accosted me.\" \"Okay, for his behaviour. David will get you a room,\" \"But I have got a room. Room 640. I checked in last night.\" \"Oh! I am sorry! Is there anything we can do to make up?\" \"You need to talk to your man, not me.\" \"Yes, I shall, but are you sure there is nothing we can do to make up? A massage? A whiskey?\" It was clear to me that even the Hotel Manager did not understand the depth of the emotional violence on me by a member of his staff.

I did some research and wound up choosing this hotel as a great location that would be pleasing to all the varying tastes of all those involved... a motley crew of varied ages, ethnicities, genders, budgets and interests. Surprisingly EVERYONE WAS SATISFIED!! The location was absolutely perfect for getting around the Embarcadero on foot. Several wonderful restaurants were just steps away\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 (particularly the pricey, but OH, so worth it! One Market). If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s raining or you just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like straying too far from the comfort of the hotel, the on-site restaurant Americano is an excellent choice for great food, too. In fact rolling out of bed and grabbing a decent breakfast in the area is quite difficult so I would strongly recommend doing so at Americano. Just make sure you get there before they stop serving it (at 10:30AM). Americano is also a great location for lunch & dinner. Anyone looking to have an intimate conversation or trying to bring together a group of people should know that this place gets LOUD, crowded, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sceney\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the night gets going. Apparently reservations are strongly recommended too, as this is a quite the HIP LOCALE for locals as well. So don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised to come down from your room on any given night and find a virtual night-club scene going on. And those who are waiting to get in tend to linger in the lobby. This was not a nuisance to me as a guest, but it could be to some. Also the noise didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t affect my stay there at all either, so no worries there. The room was beautiful\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 stunning really. Even the concave window added to the uniqueness of the room. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the staff turned on soothing ambient music with the Turn-Down service each night, leaving a little quote or poem on our pillow. And now the reason I chose our Urban Studio room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 THE DEEP SOAKING TUB! Wow! So worth the experience! I absolutely looked forward to my evening soaks, and made sure to let them last as long as possible. After all with a tub that deep, the water seems to stay warm forever, and why get out at all unless necessary? I should caution against the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Privacy Factor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as there really is none. The tub is practically in the room. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually sort of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just around the corner\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and not in a separate bathroom.

Hotel Vitale is top class. Located in the Mission district right on the Embarcadero it is the perfect start point for exploring the key SF attractions. I booked 2 advance seats on a shared van ride (supershuttle) to get to/from the airport. Reasonable rate at $70 for 2 roundtrip (including tip). This is a first come first served basis but we only had to wait 5 mins. At the airport you have to look for a representative in a green jacket. It is not possible to just deal with the driver. From memory it took about 20 mins in bust traffic. On arrival at the Vitale the bell staff are super friendly and will unload your cases and wait patiently while you check in. Hot towels are offered in the super chic reception area. Front desk staff were very welcoming and offered a free upgrade right from the start. Answered all questions efficiently and provided a city map for orientation. Really nice bell guy showed us to our room and explained that he had only move to SF a year ago and was still experiencing the city like a tourist. He engaged us in a easy conversation about our interests and made various recommendations including a trip to Sausaltio from the ferry building almost directly opposite (do this it is a beautiful place). Would also recommend the evening Alcatraaz trip (book well in advance). This guy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s helpfulness was only surpassed by the concierge who came up with the perfect options for whatever we requested. Room was immaculate and bathroom was a dream. Walk in rainfall shower and brimming with expensive toiletries. Excellent furnishings and super comfy bed/pillows. CD player with a selection of compilations. Ambient noise maker (whales, running water etc \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nice touch). LCD TV and a well stocked mini bar including a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLovers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 kit \u00ef\ufffd\u0160. 2nd floor Room with bay view directly over the bar. Agree with all the other comments about the huge happy hour crowds and noise. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t manage to get an evening drink in the bar but the noise wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an issue for us as we were generally out late. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like noise and like an early night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c book a higher floor if you are on the bay side. The room seemed a bit small after coming from our five room suite in The Hotel at The Mandalay Bay (but what wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t) We had mentioned it was our anniversary. 10 minutes after arrival there was a knock on the door with a bottle of complimentary champagne and a card from the front desk staff. The first glass hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been emptied before there was another knock which was the housekeeping manager who presented us with a picture frame and another hand written anniversary card.

As it turned out, our room was ready (we were expecting to have to store our luggage). The view of the bay bridge is absolutely incredible. Around 10 minutes after we got into our room, (the luggage was brought up immediately following), a bellhop arrived with a bottle of sparkling wine, glasses, a plate with strawberries, grapes, dates, a fresh apricot and apple and a card that said how much the hotel appreciated our staying there. We (of course!) drank and ate, and then wandered out to the ferry building and down the Embarcadero. We returned a few hours later to find a vase filled with fresh flowers, roses and stargazer lilies (I think...I'm no flower expert but they smell really good) and a handwritten hallmark card wishing us a happy anniversary and signed from the housekeeping staff. We felt incredibly well taken care of and are so impressed at how far everyone went out of their way to make us feel special.

Overall I'm extremely pleased with this hotel. The valet and front desk folks are very pleasant and helpful. The rooms (standard) are very comfortable with nice bedding, very clean bathrooms and a nice layout. I very much appreciate the free in-room internet access. I should know how the gym is, but I'm apparently too lazy to walk down the hall. Couple of places for improvement: 1.) The wait for room service can sometimes be 45 minutes or more. Even on weeknights. Even for just a salad and a dessert. 2.) The towels in the bathroom are awful. Very thin and very scratchy. I can never understand why I can get towels at Target for cheap that are 10x better and hotels rarely have soft towels. At $200+ per night I expect nice towels. And something that I don't fault the hotel for, but FYI - the bar at the onsite restaurant is this yuppy singles spot starting right after work. Makes me disinterested in eating there for dinner - after a long day of trying to impress people at the office the last thing I want to worry about is impressing strangers. But there are plenty of food options in the neighborhood, and the food via room service (once it gets to you) is great, so not a big deal.

That being said, I was a little down about my stay there. We booked a waterfront deluxe room, which was very , very nice. The problem we encountered was the noise from Americano Bar right below us. As other reviewers have mentioned, there is quite the bar scene outside. And if you are young, single and beautiful, it's a great place to be. If you are older, tired and sleep lightly, a third floor room above the bar is a very bad idea. You can practically hear individual conversations, with the window closed and the drapes pulled. However, the front desk staff were very gracious and moved us to another room, on a higher floor. Kudo's to them. Unfortunately, we left behind a more deluxe bathroom, the waters given to us at turndown, one less chair and no paper in the morning. I guess they forgot they moved us. I can't help but wonder how often people request a move from the third or fourth floors. To be fair, it was a Thursday night and the weather had been absolutely beautiful. However, hotel staff told us that this happens every Thursday/Friday/Saturday night. If you are going to stay here and you want a deluxe water view room, ask for a room above the 5th floor. My only other quibble; almost $50.00 charged for Valet Parking...WOW! I've stayed in fine hotels all over the world and never paid almost $50.00 for less than 24 hours of parking.

Outside a cab was ready to take us to the Vitale, we arrived there within an hour of touching down, to be greated by a member of staff who clearly had more important customers than us, she simply told us that our room wasn't ready and that nothing could be guarenteed before 3.00pm, it was currently 12.30.

Non plussed, she found our room and informed us it would be ready in an hour or so. We took a walk, and returned to find the room ready. We encountered what was not a Bay view room, but a very partial Bay view room. Not wanting to find anything wrong with what my husband had arranged, I tried to not say anything about the HUGE GAP ad of Claudia Schiffer on the opposite building's wall which leered at me. I laid on the bed, and then thought, well I could pull the curtain over her face, and only see on the left, the Bay bridge. But alas, the curtain did not pull that way. So I laid back on the bed to accept the situation, when I looked to my left and reflected in the large mirror was Claudia Schiffer. I can't do it! I proclaimed, knowing we were dropping 3 bills on the room. So we tried to get a better room, but our only other option was Claudia eye level on the floor above. So we took a walk and found ecstacy at the Mandarin Oriental and the only positive aspect of Vitale was they did not charge us for the time our car was parked through all this. Gee. The staff were clearly inexperienced as we were not so problematic and could have been appeased with the right room. What should be known about this hotel was when I did tell them about the intrusive ad (which is lit at night so don't think you can have darkness help you), they informed me \"Gap owns this town and they all stay here.\" Ouch.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North America", "Title": "\u201cBathroom Bloopers\u201d", "Author": "Lady_World_Traveller", "ReviewID": "UR6565341", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel Vitale on an overnight layover, and having been to San Francisco numerous times, we like to try different hotels and picked Hotel Vitale. The staff are 20-30 somethings; overall, they very friendly, professional, and accomodating. We stayed in suite that had a view of the Bay Bridge. The room is decorated in modern minimalism, but with touches of warmth, like the cozy bed with big duvet. The bed was a bit on the soft side, but we did have a restful sleep. Extra pillows and a blanket were neatly packaged in a canvas bag, sitting on the floor. A bit odd, considering there is a huge empty shelf in the closet. Overall, the hotel promotes relaxation and serenity, and we liked the new age music and white noise cd's that were stacked beside the cd player. The room service was prompt and the food was hot, well prepared, and our meals were awesome. The choc. chip cookies and milk dessert really hit the spot. I registered for the room, and my husband has a different surname than I. He was met with extreme suspicion when he ordered for us, as the person taking our order kept questioning our differing surnames. That is perhaps why we were made to pay for our food on arrival to the room; it being late at night, we decided not to pursue the issue. We just felt badly for the room service person, who was forced to make two trips: to deliver food then to run downstairs to process our credit card payment. Something to take note of if you are travelling with someone with a different surname. Ah, now to the bathroom. The bathroom has an amazing glassed-in rainfall shower, and a handy cut-out is in the glass wall to reach in and run the shower before you get in. However, I am 5'2\", and found my arm did not reach the water faucets. Therefore, my husband had to run the shower for me. A minor thing, but not very convenient if I was by myself. Also, a major thing we did not appreciate was the sliding door of the bathroom which sits about an inch above the door opening. You better be travelling with an extremely good friend or your spouse as .... every little sound carries into the room if you know what I mean. And, some things should just remain private between two people. Overall, we had a nice stay at Hotel Vitale, but would not return as the bathroom door was the deal breaker for us.

If the car is unavailable, it's still very easy to get around. Buses and street cars stop right next to the hotel and the California Street cable car is only about 2 blocks away.

We decided on staying at Hotel Vitale since my parents had stayed there and were really treated well on a prior trip to SF. We booked four rooms for the entire weekend far in advance for the trip. The hotel is very chic and has a great atmosphere, but after checking in we realized that we were put in rooms that looked onto another fold in the building directly next to the entire air conditioning unit for the hotel. We were unsure about whether we would need an additional room for our stay and at check-in the receptionists mentioned that it would be easy to book another room. However when we asked whether any other rooms were available with a better view, we were told that the hotel was completely full. As my entire family was arriving at different times, we figured that we would check back when everyone arrived to see if the hotel was able to accomodate our request. When my parents arrived, the hotel checked them into one of the rooms we had already checked in to and noted that it would be impossible to switch any of the rooms. After finally checking into all the rooms and a little more convincing, the hotel was able to locate nicer rooms for our stay. Despite the hassle, it was nice to switch rooms. All in all, the hotel is very nice, with a pretty hip bar connected to the lobby. The hotel is in perfect location to check out the Ferry building, walk to Union Square, or explore Chinatown. The rooms are nice and the beds are extremely comfortable. Additionally, the hotel has a very relaxed feeling and the staff is extremely polite. Without the headache upon check in my entire family enjoyed the stay. The only other issue was the bellman's insistance that we take a hotel car instead of hailing a cab. We needed two cabs and we only going about 10 blocks, but the bellman seemed hesitant to hailing a cab with the sedans parked in the entrance way. The best offer the cars could manage was $20 per car. After hailing our own cabs, the fare was $6. There seemed to be some collusion between the hotel and the car company.

Everyone on the staff is very professional and accomadating. When we checked out at noon I saw some people checking in and even though check in isn't until 3 pm, they accomdated everyone. The room is calming, very quiet, and luxurious. The room is also quite spacious and you can see the attention to detail throughout.

We used to live in SF, and the area the hotel is in has to be my favorite because you are right on the Embarcadero which is parallel to the water and great for walking or running. You are also a short walk from the Ferry Building, shops at Embarcardero, and great restaurants. This hotel has really thought of everything and it shows. They have an in room CD player...along with great CD's that we enjoyed throughout the weekend. They also have wonderful robes and slippers you can take home with you. We did the couples bath ritual in the hotel spa ($60 per person). They have outdoor bathtubs, and it was neat to soak on top of a hotel in downtown SF. We went to dinner at Restaurant Bix (15 minute walk) and it was EXCELLENT. We have high standards because we are spoiled by SF restaurants and it exceeded our expectations. When we got back to the room the turn down service had come and sprinkled rose petals all over our bed! The maid had also turned on a CD. Again, my Husband didn't request this...they just did it.

This was our first trip to SF. We are both 48 years young and live in Denver. Overall we had a very good experience at the Vitale. Plusses - The hotel was very quiet. There were rare execeptions, such as the reving of a motorcycle on the Embarcadero at midnight, or a room service cart being tipped-over, but these exceptions were very few and far between. The rooms on either side of us were occupied during our stay, and we never heard any noise from our neighbors. We never heard any \"normal\" traffic from the Embarcadero (or Market or Mission streets). Being new, the hotel was also very clean. As most reviewers have noted, the beds are extremely comfortable. The room thermostat worked efficiently. The computer room on the second floor had three computers, all of which were connected to a printer. VERY fast internet connection. I visited the computer room several times and there was always at least one available machine. Maid service seemed to visit the room twice per day. LOCATION! We loved the location on the Embarcadero. The Ferry Building is right across the street, and many restaurants are also within a block or two. TIP: for those wanting a cheap but good breakfast, there is a food court in the office building directly south of the hotel, across Steuart Street. We ate breakfast at Yes Burger and Malts (yes (no pun), they serve breakfast until 10:30am). However, this food court is closed on the weekend. Another Tip: some of the restaurants in this area, and in the Financial District, are closed on Sunday. Plan accordingly. The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful. The hotel offers a limo service to SFO for $45. Our taxi ride from SFO was $42. Question: do they offer this limo service from SFO to the hotel? This might be a good question to ask before arriving, as the limo was obviously much more comfortable than the taxi, for about the same price. The view from our room was as advertised: the Bay Bridge, the bay, and the Ferry Building were all right there. The Bay Bridge, lit at night, was quite nice. I did not want to close the drapes at night. That being said, the drapes when closed do block out all light. There are plenty of electical outlets just above the desk. Very handy for cell phone chargers and laptops. Minuses - As previous reviewers have noted, there are no dressers or other drawers in the room. Only a closet (approx 3-feet wide), but with plenty of hangers. (There is a small drawer below the closet.) One must definitely live out of one's suitcase. Other comments - The roof-top areas at this hotel are amazing. I did not see too many guests using it, and we under-utilized it. Besides tables and chairs, they have propane heating devices on the roof areas to keep one warm and, as above, the views are quite nice. I suspect a hotel employee would be best to start one of the propane heaters. I wish we had taken advantage and used the roof more, and the heaters at least once. The windows in the rooms cannot be opened. The mini-bar and sale of toiletries have been comment on by other reviewers. While silly and overpriced, this was a non-issue to us. We never opened the mini-bar. The plasma TV was quite nice. Besides the usual local channels, ESPN, CNN, Fox, USA, TBS, TNT, etc, there were pay-per-view movies available, including first-run and adult themes.... \"Free\" tolitries included the standard shampoo, lotion, etc. There was a hair dryer in the bathroom (located in a bag underneath the sink). Check-out time is noon. We asked for and received a 1:00 check out. We did not visit the Americano Restaurant. On weekday evenings it seemed to be very crowded. I have read and heard they do good business from the fincancial district crowd after work days. This seems to be true. The chimes on the Ferry Building clock tower begin ringing at 8:00am, and every thirty minutes thereafter. I understand there is complimentary coffee in the lobby at certain times, but I did not even bother. Each morning I walked across the street to the Ferry Building and went to Peet's Coffee. This short walk was also very enjoyable; seeing the city come to life. The aforementioned food court also has several places to buy coffee. This is a pricey hotel, but the plusses, especially the location, make it worth the price, in our opinion. We noted hordes of tourists in the Union Square and Wharf areas. To not have to deal constantly with these crowds seems to be worth any premium.

We felt very pampered and well taken care of. The only complaint I have is about the service at the Americano cafe in the hotel. We went there for breakfast and the food was very good, but service was slow and indifferent - a big change from the hotel staff.

I chose Vitale after reading reviews and getting personal recommendations from other Trip Advisor members. For those planning a trip ANYWHERE, remember that there are \"Local Experts\" available on the forums who can give you personalized recommendations based on what type of trip you are going on, be it a business trip, shopping adventure, romantic get-away or family vacation. My needs and wants may not be the same as yours so use this website to it's fullest extent! That said, here is a rundown of our vacation: We arrived at Vitale in one piece after a hair-raising shuttle van ride from the airport and were greeted warmly by the bellman, Stephen. He took care of our numerous HEAVY suitcases while we made our way to the front desk. The check-in process went smoothly and everyone was very polite and attentive. Stephen escorted us to our room on the fourth floor. I neglected to write down the room number (411 maybe?) but as you exit the elevators, it is right in front of you to the right of the corner room. It was a \"partial water view\" facing Mission St. One of the first things you notice upon exiting the elevators is the fresh lemony smell. As another reviewer mentioned, it does not have the usual \"hotel smell\" and the entire hotel is non-smoking. Stephen brought our luggage in and showed us around the room. At first glance we felt it was a rather small room but when you consider the premium on space in SF I would guess that it was average sized. It actually came to feel very cozy when we would come back from a long day of sightseeing. And after all, it's not like we were spending much time in the room! A reviewer from a while back commented on the lack of storage space and I was afraid that might be an issue but we found the corner closet and the wardrobe with a deep drawer underneath to be more than adequate for 3 days worth of clothing for 2. As most everyone has said, the bed was fabulously comfortable. The flat screen TV mounted on the wall keeps from using up precious space. At first I was disappointed that \"partial water view\" means that if you look straight out the window you DO NOT see water. However, when lying in bed or lounging on the chaise by the window, you have a great view of the Bay Bridge. I spent an hour or so just sitting there watching the traffic on the bridge and even spent a rainy afternoon writing out Christmas cards while looking out at the Bay. The bathroom was nicely appointed but again is not enormous. We would have liked to peek into a room with a \"rainforest shower\" to see if they are bigger but never did ask. The complimentary soap and shampoo are lemony and are so good that I stashed each day's refills in my bag for future travels. I was tempted to try the additional items offered for sale but they were too pricey for me. The nightstands are cool and you get a CD player/alarm clock combo. At turndown housekeeping put on a mellow, jazzy Christmas CD that we enjoyed returning to. Other nice touches are the complimentary slippers that you get to take home to remember your stay, decadent bathrobes (sorry they are not free but are available for purchase) and bottles of water and a weather forecast left at turndown. Another small but appreciated touch was a light in the shower. Some showers feel so dark! Every time we passed through the lobby, Stephen greeted us warmly by name, making us feel like true guests instead of just a number. The hotel has a courtesy car which will bring you anywhere within a mile of the hotel but be aware that you must find your own way back. Oh, and the Vitale's driver is NOT your typical SF driver! He was courteous and drove sanely. We left for dinner one rainy evening and the valet gave us loaner umbrellas. Be sure to check out the rooftop patio areas both during the day and at night. Unfortunately for us, a front passed through while we were there so it was too cool and windy to stay out there for long. There is also a small business center on the second floor where you can get on the internet. Back to the public transportation issue, the F-line trolley stop (takes you to Fisherman's Wharf) is just behind Vitale and the BART station is a short walk up Market so you can get just about anywhere once you know the routes. Being from a small Southern town we were not familiar with public transportation but a friendly native gave us the basics. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, choosing instead to try some of the \"Bests\" while in SF. Check out my reviews of Yank Sing, Scoma's and John's Grill for details of these amazing establishments! We did the obligatory Alcatraz tour which was pretty cool and spent a bit of time browsing the shops at Pier 39. For us, the location was superb. After seeing the Fisherman's Wharf area, I'm glad we decided not to stay there. It may be close to the action but it was just too \"touristy\". Since our travel goal was sightseeing and not shopping we had no desire to go to Union Square. The only negatives I can think of are, as mentioned by other guests, no in-room coffeemaker (and the coffee in the lobby goes fast!) and the high valet fee. We rented a car Sat evening to drive to Tahoe Sunday and had to park it overnight. Again, I know there is a lack of space in SF so even parking is a premium but $46 per night seems extremely high. The only other problem was that Vitale set such a high standard that the hotels in Tahoe and Reno seemed like dumps by comparison!

Lots of restaurants (mostly seafood) - but the best thing to eat were the hot dogs from the food stands. The aquarium is very cool, and the sea lions are stinky, but are a must (just following the \"barking\"). - Alcatraz evening tour - seeing the sun set over the Golden Gate bridge from the ferry and the island was incredible. Also Alcatraz isn't as creepy as you may think it is - it's very interesting and full of history - and worth it just for the views of the city of SF. - Chinatown - really neat shops with interesting finds. - Union Square - all of the designer shops are located here - I was really impressed with Macy's! - Ocean Beach - it's a long haul from the Hotel Vitale (on the MUNI - their subway/transit system) - but worth it just for the beautiful sounds, sights, and smells of the Pacific.

We have read many reviews of the Vitale which comment upon the great location, the excellent standard of the rooms and the coolness of the interior and exterior spaces - and we agree with them all. We would like to comment upon the 'experience' of staying at the Vitale at the beginning of October 2005. At check in we were greeted extremely warmly and courteously - the staff appeared to have a genuine interest in us and our trip. When Reception discovered we were on our honeymoon they immediately offered us a complimentary bottle of Champagne. As if this was not enough, they also asked my wife if she preferred chocolates or flowers! Somehow, by the time we got up to our room a chilled bottle of Champage and a box of liqueur chocolates were waiting for us - which made us feel very special indeed. Throughout our stay other staff members (particularly the barman and a wonderful waitress in Americano)made us feel particularly welcome and at home in the hotel. I would go so far as to say that the Vitale had by far the friendliest and most helpful staff of any hotel I have ever stayed in. We went on a trip around California for the second week of our holiday, but returned to San Francisoco for our final two days. We loved the Vitale so much that we booked in for the final nights before we returned home. When we returned to the Hotel we were given a great room on the 4th floor, which was of the same standard as we had stayed in on our first stay. The only drawback was that it had a view of the inner courtyard (as opposed to the Bay bridge etc). When I asked the manager about the possibility of a change of room he could not have been more helpful and understanding. He explained that the hotel was fully booked for that night, but promised that he would provide us with a room with a view for our final night. True to his word - and typical of the lengths Vitale staff went to during our stay - we were upgraded (at no extra cost) to one of the oval suites with panoramic plate glass windows, sunken bath,walk in shower, and 180 degree views of the Bay. This gesture was the perfect end to a fantastic holiday - and something that will live long in our memory. It just goes to show that the hotel industry still has the capacity to turn a 'stay' into an 'experience'- it is just unfortunate that there are not more hotels that try as hard as the Vitale.

Had booth where they were cooking breakfast, bakery booths, flowers, etc. etc. Not a large hotel. I'm guessing the rooms on the back without a view of the bridge or on lower floors arent as great. But everyone has access to the porch/balconies along the side of the hotel on the 5th and 7th (it seemed) floors, which have chairs/sofas with cushions and views from bay bridge over to alcatraz.

The energy of the financial district is felt every morning as the town comes to life. Wonderful little coffee shops and restaurants for breakfast right across the street in the Ferry building. On Saturday morning a Farmers Market occurs here which is not to be missed. We found the staff and personnel at the Hotel to be \" World Class \" in every detail. I can't for the life of me figure out why this hotel doesn't get more press as it is truly one of the best kept secrets in S.F. Easy access to the Wharf via the F line right in front of hotel. $1.50 and 10 minutes and you're right down in the heart of the action but just far enough away not to be plagued by the tourist trap hotels and all the commotion that goes with them. We took several of the guided tours through Gray Line with pick up provided at the front door of the hotel each morning by Gray line. Not to be missed are the Napa - Sonoma wine country tour and the Monterey - Carmel tour. Do yourself a favor and take the city tour combined with Muir Woods and Sausalito. When you get to Sausalito, leave the bus and have a nice dinner in Sausalito ( Scomas restaurant on the water is our personal favorite ) and take the ferry back over to San Francisco ( brings you back to the Ferry Building right across the street from the Vitale ). I promise you that it will be something you will remember forever. For that really special dinner one night we highly recommend the Cliff House restaurant. Make a reservation as it's way across town ( $ 22.50 cab ride each way ) on the other shore, but you will not believe the setting or the quality of the food. They have a web-site which will give you a peek at what we mean. Outstanding !! I recommend an early reservation as you will want to take a lot of photos here while it's light out. Be sure to make a point of getting over to Ghiradelli Square and having one or two of their delighfully sinful Hot Fudge sundaes and see how chocolate is actually made. The Franciscan Inn at Pier 41 serves a whole Dungeness crab for dinner that is to die for !!! Right next door is the Boudin bakery which offers a tour of how sour dough bread is made and also has great food for lunch.

The hotel is also convenient for public transport with the F line tram stopping outside the hotel, a number of buses also stop outside the hotel and the California line cable car is about 2 blocks from the hotel. For those visiting San Francisco for the first time here are a few tips. 1. The California line cable car stops in the middle of nowhere. 2. If you want to get the cable cars from Union Square then if you do not want to queue then get there before 9am or after 5pm 3. A visit to Sausalito is well worth it and it is cheaper on the ferry from the ferry building (which is opposite the hotel) than from Pier 41. 4. If you plan to use the cable cars or public transport then consider a Muni pass as this can prove to be a lot cheaper than paying for every trip. 5.

I asked that a bottle of champagne be placed in our room in advance of our arrival. When we checked in we were given a handicapped accessible room (neither of us are handicapped). The room would be nice for someone who was handicapped, but for us it just wasn't comforable. The bathroom was awkwardly arranged- the shower consisted of a shower spout and drain on the floor (no tub or even a shower stall). This is not what I call romantic. Additionally, the sink was set significantly lower to accomodate wheelchairs (not particularly comfortable for those not in wheelchairs). More importantly, the champagne was not in the room. My husband called the front desk and told them the room was not acceptable. The clerk said they would send someone up to our room to collect our bags and move us to another room. We waited 20 plus minutes before someone met us to give us the keys to our new room. This was not pleasant given we had just arrived on a late flight from NYC (we were tired and jet lagged). It also kind of killed the romantic surprise I had planned for my husband. The room they gave us was nice and the champagne was waiting for us, but we weren't given a room with a view. I would have thought given the problems at check-in they would have upgraded our room. In any event, our overall stay was pleasant.

Room service was quite tasty and the staff was fairly friendly. However, we encountered one other problem during our stay. The night before our check-out I placed my heels outside of the room for the complimentary overnight shoe shine. Unfortunately, the shoes were not returned to me the next day. I didn't realize it until two days later when I was going out for an upscale dinner in the wine country. As it turns out the hotel staff said they did not return the shoes to us because we had the privacy tag on our door on the morning of our check-out. I'm not sure why they didn't leave the shoes outside of our room or take them to the front desk to give to us at check-out, but nonetheless after a brief negotiation, the hotel agreed to overnight Fed-Ex the shoes to our hotel in Sonoma. They arrived without incident. I would recommend this hotel to others but with the caveat of asking for a room with a view and ensuring it's not the handicapped accesible room. Also, make sure to pick up your shoes before you check-out. One last piece of advice, Visa has a deal that if you pay with your Visa card, you get 20% off the room rate.

We walked around and loved SF and the close proximity of transportation and necessities. Keep in mind that on the weekends, most eateries in the financial district are closed. We were peacefully sleeping when at 5:00AM four large tables crashed out in the hallway. An employee evidently was preparing for a future event on the 7th floor terrace. The next morning, housekeeping knocked quietly and quickly and came on in at 8:00AM to our shock. The next day, when we returned at 4:30PM to prepare for dinner with family, housekeeping was in our room and we had to wait outside. Also, if you don't get downstairs before 7:00AM, you will miss the complimentary coffee and must pay $3.00 a cup. Overall, they went above and beyond the call of duty for what they feel is important, but a dresser, housekeepting at reasonable hours, and complimentary coffee are important to us.

We were very happy to be able to watch over the Ferry building, and see a good portion of the bay and the entire bay bridge. Very cool at night. Also, the room was cool, modern chic, with a very comfortable bed, flat screen tv, and the usual amenities. Americano is a fun bar/happy hour scene. Walking distance (10-15 min) to Pac Bell park. The \"rainforest\" shower heads are really awesome, but they have a little \"cut out\" in the shower door to turn on and test the temperature of the water (which is a neat idea) but it gets the toilet soaked when someone is showering! CONS: The overnight valet is 42 dollars (PLUS %14 tax!) PER NIGHT. This was almost a dealbreaker, but since no one had forwarned me (nothing on the website or told to me when I made the reservation) I wasn't going to forfeit a nights rate. The agent at the desk basically gave me \"I know that sucks, but there is nothing I can do\" response when I reacted a bit strongly to finding out parking alone was going to cost me upwards of $150 for the weekend. On the Sunday night we were there, my fiancee and I were woken up to what sounded like loud banging coming from pipes in the walls. This went on for a few minutes when I called the front desk. When the agent picked up, I could hear it 10 times louder over the phone. She said something to the effect of \"I think they are working on something in the kitchen, I'll get them to stop\" We were on the 5th FLOOR! They did stop however. Who authorizes construction at 2am??? We guessed that it was either an emergency, or that guest capacity was at a minimum on a Sunday night. Either way, no follow up or apology was offered, even when I inquired about it the next morning (I just got blank stares from the staff.) Breakfast in Americano was okay, service a bit akward and cold food (on one occasion) OVERALL: A really nice hotel, which is definitely going through some growing pains, which should be hammered out (no pun intended) relatively soon.

These are first-class accomodations! The hotel was bright and beautiful and the staff was incredibly warm. Every staff member I passed asked me how I was doing, if I was enjoying the hotel, etc. A very personal touch.... We would not hesitate to stay there again. Allow me to describe the hotel... It is located in a beautiful new section of town on Embarcadero and Mission, by Pier 1 and directly across the street from the historic Ferry Building (BTW - every Saturday there is a wonderful Farmers Market there where you can enjoy simply amazing fresh produce, flowers, herbs and food). The hotel is designed using the principles of simplicity, functionality and beauty. Everything is exactly as it should be... Very \"Feng Shui\". The beds are super comfortable (down comforters/pillows and silky sheets), the furniture is beautiful, functional, artfully crafted and simple. The rooms have wonderfully comfortable robes and slippers in the closet. The showers were awesome, as were the complimentary SugarBath products. Our room also had a plasma/lcd flat screen TV at the foot of our bed. The views from the high rooms on the bay side of the hotel are fabulous. We stayed on the 8th (top) floor and had a panoramic view of the Bay Bridge and the sunrise. Awesome to wake up to... Many (if not all) of the floors have terraces that you can go and sit out on to overlook the city. The hallways always had fresh flowers and candles for ambience. As far as the hotel bar/restaurant, we had a drink there and enjoyed it. The staff was quite courteous and were very attentive. I will also note that if you are looking for a \"scene\" the hotel bar could be it. After work the bar gets a good crowd, which is nice. By the way, one of the top 10 restaurants in the city (\"Boulevard\") is also directly across the street from the hotel. We had a great meal there. The hotel's proximity to everything is good. You have the SF buses 1 block away, light rail on the corner, limo service directly from the hotel and cable cars around the corner. If you like to walk, Fishermans Wharf (pier 39) is a 20 minute walk along the bay (a nice walk). A note about SF - This is a nice area to stay in - close proximity without the crowds (and everything that goes along with that) of staying directly on the wharf. The wharf is super-commercial. I prefer really being one with the city as opposed to being part of all of the tourist traps. Then I am free to enjoy some peace as well. My wife and I have stayed at many hotels, and we would absolutely not hesitate to recommed this one. We had a wonderful stay and were really bummed when vacation was over.

Its strongest advantage is its location on the corner of Mission and the Embarcadero, which gives easy access to central SF as well as the harbour. Close to the Bay Bridge, it sits opposite the Ferry Terminal, with wonderfully airy views across to the water if you get one of the appropriate rooms. The roof terraces offer some spectacular views of the surrounding area (see photos), but no shade is provided for the seating areas up there. The tramway departs alongside the hotel - downtown one way, Fisherman's Wharf the other - and it is a short stroll to the California-Van Ness cable car route. The Ferry Building itself is a great nearby resource for fresh foodstuffs and a variety of meals and snacks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it does not open until 10am most mornings - as well as the ferry to Sausalito. The Embarcadero Centre is a useful nearby shopping mall. ROOMS The modest exterior of the hotel has been the subject of architectural debate, but it is pleasant enough. The hotel lobby is somewhat cavernous and lacking in character, but the reception staff are young, bright and friendly. The bedrooms are modern and comfortable, with some stylish fittings. The artwork ranges, disappointingly, from the rather twee to the harshly modern. The flatscreen TV is a bonus, but we did not encounter the DVD player or IPod dock enjoyed by other reviewers (fortunately we brought our own). The bathrobes, slippers, and bathroom products are exceptional. Wardrobe space is rather limited, but the turndown service is well up to US preoccupations with this (for us) obscure ritual. Room service was impeccable and the housekeeping team a total delight. OTHER SERVICES The spa service is terrific but rather limited. Contra another reviewer, the massage (from Sharon) was the best ever. The restaurant provides food of high quality, drawing upon the resources of the Farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Market at the Ferry Terminal. We were deterred from evening dining by the noisy bar scene, but there are excellent restaurants a few yards away such as Boulevard, Shanghai 1930, and Slanted Door.

The room was smaller than I had imagined but adequate, and I was disappointed to find no bathtub. The room description online indicated that the bathroom was a \"spa style\" bathroom with a \"rain\" shower head. The rain shower head was great, but I expected there would be a tub as well. The other downside of the room was the traffic noise that could be heard from the street. The obvious trade off of facing the busy Embarcadero St. is the view of the bay, etc., but light sleepers might be annoyed by the traffic noise. The Embarcadero typically quiets down in the late evening hours, but the occasional bus and truck could be heard throughout the night. My favorite part of the hotel (besides the incredible bed) was its location. If I were a tourist, I would prefer this location right across the street from the Ferry Building as opposed to those hotels found in Union Square. It's easy to get to either Union Square or Fisherman's Wharf from this hotel via various forms of mass transportation or simply by walking if you don't mind a 20 to 30 minute walk. There are numerous fine dining restaurants within the immediate vicinity of the hotel, including Boulevard....one of the city's best restaurants. And if you're a baseball fan, it's conveniently located within a mile of SBC park. Overall, I would recommend this hotel if you can afford it. The service from the staff was excellent....quick to respond when you need it; invisible when you don't.", "Date": "April 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNothing Spectacular\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3351517", "Content": "I have to say, I was not terribly impressed with the Hotel Vitale by any means. We've definitely experienced worse, but by no means do I think this place is anything spectacular - or worthy of four stars. If you're just looking for a reasonably clean hotel, and aren't looking for 4 Seasons level service - this place should fit the bill. If you want some more dirt, read on... Decor alone - high marks for sure. Great linens, and overall comfy, understated elegance. Nice touch was the lavendar sprigs they put on each door for bedtime. Location - across from the Embarcadero and all was great, but overall it is a pretty desolate area on the weekends with no where in walking distance to grab a coffee, etc. Overall, from a service standpoint, I think it was marginal at best and bound to slide more if this is just the honeymoon phase... We booked for Friday and Saturday night (4/8 and 4/9). My husband had called ahead the day before we had arrived and requested a cot for our 11 year old daughter. The person he spoke with indicated it would not be a problem and told him to mention it upon check-in. We checked in around 8:30pm on Friday and mentioned the cot to the reception desk. They had indicated it would not be a problem and would be arranged by the time we returned from dinner. We got back to the hotel at 11:30 - exhausted and ready to hit the hay, suprise - no cot! Because we were so exhausted and because we're really not complainers, we decided to squeeze into the king bed - which I have to say, was quite comfy with great linens, duvet, etc. We opted not to park our rental car at the hotel - just under $50 a day or so (there is a parking garage about a block away for 1/2 that)- and instead took cabs. Never once was there someone ready and waiting to hail a cab as you would come to expect from 4 star hotel. Day 2 - we returned to our hotel (having spent the entire day sightseeing, shopping, etc) at 10:30pm only to have our keys not work. Having read the other review where somone's room was given to someone else, I have to say, we were a little concerned. We went back down to reception, got our new keys (no sincere apologies or explanation) and got back into our room - luckily, all our stuff was there! Day 3 - we waited in line to check out (because they had incorrectly billed us for valet parking which we'd passed on) for about 15 minutes. The best part is the people at the desk were answering phones and accepting reservations while they were trying to check people out. On a Sunday morning, I cannot for the life of my understand how they would be busying themselves with reservations while there are people trying to check out!", "Date": "April 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Encino, California", "Title": "\u201cI'm picky, but this place was great\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3337317", "Content": "I left after a terrible experience at a hotel down the street and found this great hotel. It had just opened. The staff was helpful and friendly. The room was large and with great windows. Many city hotels are claustraphobic, but this one was spacious. The hotel is modern, but it manages to still feel homey. You have all the amenities. Rather than having a small corner to work, you have a great desk. The Dean and Deluca snacks in the mini bar are a great touch. I had a massage in the new spa. It is small but very nice. I plan to go back again and highly recommend it.

I've never stayed in such a room... the attention to detail and design were amazing... great bathroom products (a great break from Aveda), healthy snacks/bar, automatic window shutters, sound machine, long working desk with office chair, very comfortable bed/pillows, iPod speaker system, dvd player, flat screen tv, interesting magazines, unique services and amenities offered, regular and rain drop shower heads in glass faced walk-in shower with wooden stool, two sinks in separate toilet/shower rooms, mini bar, Bose alarm clock, sofa and chair, bath tub by the window, 270 degree views, circular room design, etc. You must experience this room. As far as customer service went, it was excellent... everyone is super helpful/friendly (and presentable) and although the hotel has a stylish, hip feel, you feel comfortable and not pressed to \"be cool\". And when you check out, you really do feel like you had a relaxing stay. The spa/wellness, natural theme should appeal to all types of travelers. The Americano (Italian) restaurant complements the hotel well, too. In my opinion, it is a great date place because of its reasonable prices, classy/stylish feel and opportunity for pre and after dinner drinks in either the long bar area or circular lounge. Lastly, you can't really beat this location. It is along the Embarcadero/water and across from the Ferry Building/Farmer's Market... a great place to hang out during the day, for food, exercise, sights, etc. Hotel Vitale should be THE place to stay from here on out.
