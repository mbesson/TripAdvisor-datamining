This hotel is practically across the street from that location in an excellent and untouristy part of the city. We had booked a suite and were very pleased with what we received. Our suite was situated on the top floor in the back. Most importantly we had real privacy and quiet. There was no one above us and there were no common walls with any other rooms. Great! We had 2 complete and roomy bathrooms and 2 flat screen tv's. There was a large entry foyer from which one could enter either the bedroom suite or through french doors connecting to a separate living room with its own complete bath. The king bed was very comfy. I like to stay up late and my wife likes to go to bed early. I respect her quiet time so it is important that I not disturb her. With the great floor plan she wasn't bothered at all. There was a small kitchenette with frig as well. Everything from the carpets to the bathroom fixtures were clean and of good quality. Nothing showed signs of wear. The included breakfast was continental in style, typically adequate but not gourmet, served in a beautiful wood paneled dining room. The coffee was excellent. Old world and very classy with an art and musical feel. It was our impression that most of the other clients staying here are elder, sophisticated and well traveled. You won't be finding any bumbling and rude tourists at this location. They'd never find it. We booked a limo from the airport through the hotel staff and it was great as well; very professional and courteous treatment. I checked and the price was only about $5 more than for a taxi from SFO to the hotel. We'll do exactly the same thing next time. The price from SFO was $45. Its only a couple of blocks to Market Street where you can hop on the \"F\" Trolley. It will take you all the way to the historic clock tower or anywhere inbetween for just $2, or 75 cents if you're a senior or close to it. These trollies are restored and were built in the 40's. A great feel and ride. Mostly locals take it. Just take exact change and pay onboard. It was important for us that this hotel is practically across the street from the War Memorial Opera House where one can see the best Ballet and Opera the west coast of the US has to offer. The website for the Ballet is: www.sfballet.org.

I visit San Francisco every couple of years for business and I've stayed at various hotels near the Moscone Center, on Nob Hill and near the major shopping areas. Inn at the Opera is located in an interesting part of the city that I never knew about. It's near the regal San Francisco Opera House, the majestic San Francisco Symphony, the ballet, city hall, a chinese cultural museum; all these building surrounding a grand plaza. If you walk out of the hotel and look to the right, you're staring at the Opera House, but I don't think the fat lady stays at Inn at the Opera. More like ballerinas. In other words, the single rooms are small. Mine had a nice, comfortable bed, no real bureau, other than a couple of shelves in a tiny closet, and a small work table. One nice touch: a microwave, refrigerator and some dishes and silverware. The white-tiled bathroom was actually spacious, compared to the room itself. Everything worked, free Internet, friendly staff, chocolates on your pillow everyday, funky little elevator. In other words, Inn at the Opera is a nice alternative to the larger hotels. For $129 a night, it can't be beat. There's a continental breakfast served in a room that doubles as the Ovations restaurant at night. The breakfast was okay; bagels, muffins, spreads, coffee, tea, hard-boiled eggs, cereal. One little quirky thing -- apparently the electrical system can't handle two toasters going at the same time, so we all had to coordinate our bagel toasting so as to not blow the power strip. Other than that minor quirk, Inn at the Opera is a great choice, as long as you're okay with not being in the thick of the action. Oh, and there are a ton of interesting restaurants on the next street over -- Hayes Street, which cater to the symphony crowd. I ate at Hayes Street Grill one night and it was excellent.

You can try to find street parking across from the hotel if you're lucky (but be sure to ask about street cleaning days). There are no kid specific activities or areas, but if you're a parent traveling with kids my guess is that you'll already be plenty prepared with things brought from home to keep them occupied. :) Nothing fancy, but the little things they did made our stay enjoyable.

There are 7 stories w/an elevator that takes 4 max & carpeted stairs directly from the lobby. The front lobby area has room to sit & relax for both hotel & restaurant guests. There are a limited number of complimentary local newspapers available early in the morning; cookies from Subways occasionally offered mid-afternoon, & nightly chocolates for the evening turndown service. The restaurant is in the back & serves a complimentary buffet breakfast for hotel guests (fresh fruit, toast/bagels w/cream cheese, butter, & jam, hard-boiled eggs, Subway sweet muffins, milk, water, oj, coffee/tea, & cereal), room service w/a limited but reasonably priced menu (5-9PM), & dinner & cocktails w/a more expansive & expensive array of choices.

We had reserved a newly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153renovated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room trying for the newest bed they had. The renovated rooms all had flat screen TVs & I-pod docks, but otherwise the wood furniture was still chipped & scratched, wall paper stained & peeling in places, & the beds 7-10 years old.

Ours was one size up from the smallest called an Orchestra room w/a separate small living area (9x12 feet) w/a firmly cushioned sofa, a table w/1 chair (upon request, a 2nd chair was delivered), a flat screen TV & simple DVD player on the wall, & a kitchenette w/a microwave, 3 cubic foot refrigerator, a sink, & a 2x3 foot counter, cabinets overhead containing tableware for 4 & dish cleaning supplies, & a coffee maker w/2 samples of caffeinated & decaf coffee. 2 narrow doors w/a light-weight cloth covering the glass separated the bedroom from the living area.

The bathroom had a stand-alone sink w/a narrow glass shelf above, which made using the sink difficult for washing the face, a hair dryer & night light, complimentary toiletries, towels for 2, shower/tub w/2 bars for aiding balance, & enough towel racks for all our towels, though the bath towel racks blocked access to the glass shelf.

I was clear that I was traveling with a friend, and we definitely needed two beds, or a bed with sleep sofa. Miguel, the manager at SFW, told me he'd spoken to the Inn management and they could provide a rollaway bed. I had been told we had a \"Studio\" room reserved, with mini-fridge,microwave, and coffeepot. So off we went, excited to be spending 2 days in a new part of town and in a property I'd not seen before. When we arrived, the staff at Inn at the Opera stored our bags until the room was ready. They told me they did not have an available room with a sleep sofa, or with 2 double beds, but did have rollaway beds, and once again, I stressed to them that we definitely needed 2 beds. My friend and I went off to find lunch and adventure, and came back shortly after three PM to check into our room. At the desk, I asked about the rollaway bed. The desk clerk told me that, sadly, they had given out the last one, but that the bed would be comfortable for both of us. When I asked why a rollaway wasn't held for us, as the reservation had been made on Thursday, 2 days before, he told us that no matter when it's reserved, it's on a first come, first served basis. After a hurried consultation at the desk, my friend and I went to look at the room, to see if we could survive the next 2 days comfortably. What a shock when we walked into the room. The bellman who brought our luggage up could barely get all 4 suitcases in the room. The overall room size, including the bathroom, narrow entrance hall, and \"kitchenette\"(a microwave and coffeeepot on a shelf over a mini-frig, no counter or work space), was barely 160 s.f. There was a full-size bed (measured it...certainly wasn't a queen) and one small 24\" round table jammed into a corner with a big lamp sitting on it and a chair in front of it. Other than that and the bed, no place to sit, no room to swing a cat! And even a mid-afternoon on a sunny day, with all the lights on, the room was distressingly dark. Even if I were traveling alone, I would not have stayed in that room. While I've traveled throughout Europe and understand the concept (and size and scale)of a European style hotel, that room was just...sad. Twenty minutes later I had booted up my laptop, logged onto priceline, and found a four-star (The Omni Hotel, on California St in the Financial District) for $130 per night. I called downstairs for the bellman again, and when I checked out, I asked the front desk clerk where he was planning on putting the rollaway bed if one had been available, and he admitted that they knew there was no place in that room to put one. I think that was the most infuriating part of the whole situation for me.

I needed a hotel that met my company expense account requirements (not easy in San Francisco), especially during the weekend of the SF Marathon. When a Holiday Inn room in SF is priced at $279 a night, you know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a challenge to find anything decent, but by booking 6 weeks in advance I was able to secure a room at Inn at the Opera for $124 a night before tax, Ballet studio using my AAA membership rate. The Inn at the Opera Building is a narrow 7 story building right next to the San Francisco Ballet building on Franklin and Fulton streets. The hotel lobby is not big, but the hotel photos reflect it accurately. Continue walking straight past the front desk and you will see a small business center with computer and printer, and then the Ovation restaurant and bar in the back. This is where the continental breakfast was served each morning and it opens for dinner at night. I had read other Tripadvisor reviews that mentioned how small the Ballet studio could be and how some did not have a desk or sitting area. I called and then e-mailed about a week out to request a Ballet suite with a desk. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad I did because while the room was smaller (about 200 sf) it did have everything I needed including a nice built in kitchenette with microwave, refrigerator, sink, dishes, wine glasses, flatware and cups as well as a coffeemaker. The room had a flat panel screen TV-it looked like it was about 27\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but adequate with a DVD player. There was also a nice sized armoire to hold hanging suits as well as 3 large drawers for clothing. The bed was very comfortable with very nice soft linens and pillows. The towels in the bathroom were also very plush. The Inn appears to have about 14 rooms per floor. It looks like the Ballet studio can vary from reasonable to one \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hotwire\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd level room tucked towards the back of the building. This must be the one others on this site have complained about as it looked tiny. I think my room; Room 26 was a medium sized ballet studio. The hotel website shows a ballet suite with a nice couch and bay windows-if this is so, I was not offered one of those. I have attached a floor plan to this review so that you can see how the floors actually layout. You will see the only 2 rooms on the whole floor are the same room represented as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ballet Suite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on their website. The hotel was sold out that weekend, but service didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to suffer at all. The staff are very nice and competent-Jesse at the Front desk deserves recognition for how helpful and polite he always was. His attitude is a great reflection on the Inn. This place is truly a small boutique style Inn. It is not a 4 or 5 star hotel. It is more of a 3- star place, as the furniture while nice is a little dated to the 80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s The elevator many complained about is indeed small-about the size of a coat closet, with a door you have to open manually so that you can get in the elevator cab. Some may find this charming, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more of an annoyance if you are trying to get your bags in while balancing the door. This hotel reminds me of an old Town or University club, with furnishings you might see in your grandmothers house-nicely cared for but a little worn. There were lots of Europeans there when I stayed there. They seemed to overtake the continental breakfast buffet so I would just take a plate up to my room each morning. The buffet has sliced melon, bagels, cream cheese, boiled eggs, cottage cheese and English muffins. It could use some cold cuts or cheeses. In summary, for the price it is a bargain but also bear in mind that you get what you pay for. The fact that it was close to the BART /Airport train, the Muni, and the other places I needed to go around City Hall made it very convenient. By the way, for many years I would rent a car in SF and pay the ridiculous parking charges. Once I got to know the BART and Muni routes there was no reason to have a car-the public transport options in San Francisco are just fantastic. I bought a 7 day \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Passport\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pass that is good on the Muni, Cable Cars, etc. It will get you anywhere you need to go, and you can buy them at City Hall on the first floor, or at the Powell/Market Muni station. Their website is www.SFMuni.com if you want to check it out. Here are my likes and dislikes of Inn at the Opera: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Likes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Coffee and Wet Bar in Room Good towels Continental Breakfast Free newspapers (except Sunday) Hotel staff Location-great SF neighborhood Relative ease getting from SFO airport via BART Housekeeping is excellent Pretty fast taxi service-via front desk phone call \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dislikes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Circa 1996 Third world country Internet speeds if it connects at all Hotel not entirely forthcoming about what \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ballet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd suites really are Check-out time of 11:00 am Alley or no view from a majority of the rooms Extremely narrow and dark hallways and ancient elevator Disappearing doorman/valet (rarely saw them) Poor television reception TV remotes didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work Very poor air ventilation/circulation in the hotel No pool or fitness area or alternatives in the neighborhood Having stayed primarily at 4 or 5 star hotels on Nob Hill, Union Square or the Financial District during past stays in SF, I would say this was a decent alternative, because the location was convenient to where I needed to be. But I would not consider it a 4 star hotel. The facility is 3 stars and the staff makes it 3-1/2, in my opinion. Just be sure to call them to know exactly what you are booking or you may be very disappointed. They should really do a better job of posting pictures of all possible Ballet studio options, rather than that of the bay windowed one with the couch.

If you are alone it can be a little disconcerting. As for the hotel- I stayed in the ballet type room which is a studio unit. There is a very small fridge and microwave with plates, silverware and dishes which is nice. Its an older property so the rooms are small but have a lot of character. Shower is great with plenty of water pressure and hot water. The beds are very comfy and the towels are big and fluffy. The complimentary continental breakfast is really only so-so. If I was only here a few days it probably would have been great but after a few weeks I was willing to pay for other options just for variety. Juice, coffee/tea, english muffins, bagels, melon, hard-boiled eggs and cold cereal pretty much sum it up. They put signs up saying to limit your breakfast to 30mins when the property is busy?? That did not feel friendly but it does get crowded on weekends. I did not eat dinner in the restaurant but the room service menu was reasonably priced and the onion soup is excellent!! I liked the rooms facing the front of the hotel- great views and much quieter than the ones on the corner- not sure why but the street noise is louder on the corners. There is no air conditioning and some rooms have ceiling fans and some don't. In July its actually quite cool (60s- low 70s) so I was not needing it at all. The staff is not what I would call overly friendly but they are helpful if you make requests. I don't have a car here but if you do- parking is pricey but hey---its San Francisco.

As other reviewers have stated, staff were friendly and helpful. We had a ballet room and, like others, found the furniture and layout unsuitable for business use. However, we were moved the following day to another ballet room with a desk and a chair so, if you need these items it would be worth saying so when booking. There is some traffic and other guest noise but we did not find it unacceptable. Our room was on the seventh floor so lift access was necessary. The lift is small, only accepting four guests at a time, and the wait for it, though never unacceptably long, could be tiresome at times. The room we stayed in was a little on the small and dark side but did have the benefit of a fridge, micro wave, coffee maker and sink. Wardrobe facilities (I was told that this is closet in American!) were entirely inadequate for any but a weekend stay. As we were staying for nine days this was an important matter. There is no air conditioning. There was a large flat screen TV with sufficient channels to maintain our interest and an iPod dock and DVD player. WiFi access is free and the speed, though not lightening, is acceptable for business use, however, network contact failed on a regular basis. Fixing this was simple enough, just a matter of logging on again, but it was irritating as were the odd connection delays. There were sufficient points to allow us charge our phones, iPad, Kindle etc. An ironing board and iron are provided. Everything was clean and well serviced, with the odd, minor occasional omission. The small bathroom was functional enough. The shower was adequate but, I suspect, not entirely working to specification and I would have thought that renovation will soon be needed. The sink was very slightly chipped. The breakfast buffet was acceptable. However, in our nine day stay, the lack of variety became a little boring. Service was reasonable enough though it seemed that staffing levels were not sufficient to cope easily with a full room. Restaurant and bar hours (5 p.m. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 9 p.m.) seemed rather restrictive. As an Englishman, I may not understand the American way of tipping, but I felt that the pad left on every table at breakfast for guests to add a tip on a daily basis was, well, unsubtle! We ate once in the Ovation restaurant. Prices were high for the location, about $130 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 150 for two people taking two courses with a glass of wine each including tax and 15% tip. European visitors would need to brace themselves for the shock of the cost of $10 for an admittedly generous glass of house red. Food quality was about acceptable at the price but portions were small by American standards. At the room rate we paid, and as Opera goers we were supposedly receiving a discount, I would have said that the hotel was a little on the expensive side for what we received but I have no knowledge of San Francisco rates generally.

There are a lot of reviews for Inn at the Opera and they were mostly positive, so I booked one of the small \"Ballet\" rooms. I was a little concerned when I realized that this hotel was part of the dreaded \"time-share\" system, but there was absolutely no sign of it when we checked in and not a hint of anything in the way of a sales pitch. The accomodations were modest, but well-maintained and spotlessly clean. The room of course was very small, but we did not plan to spend much time in the room since we were sightseeing. The hotel has an old-world charm about it and it felt very comfortable. Every staff member that we had contact with was pleasant and helpful. The breakfast that came with the room was good, but basic - coffee, juice, muffins, some fresh fruit, and cottage cheese and a few other things. The location is great - very close to the Civic Center with all its attractions. Davies symphony Hall is literally right around the corner.

We had reserved two rooms: a ballet for my father in-law and his wife, and an opera for us, family of 4 with teenagers. I called the hotel previously and to let them know we would be arriving late, and Javier was most kind. Upon entering, the hotel seems very small from the outside, but as soon as you enter you get this European feel of a turn of the century mansion. It is beautifuly decorated and also has a restaurant, but did not use it. Our room was great! We had a master bedroom with ensuite bathroom, a small dining table with 3 chairs, a kitchenette (microwave, fridge, coffe maker w/coffe, sink) and plenty of tableware for the whole family. It also had a sitting area with a sofa sleeper where my teenage daughters slept and another HUGE bathroom, which was very nice to have, so that we could all get ready in the morning faster. The hotel staff is extremely friendly and really get out of their way to make you feel welcome. They offered us fresh warm cookies and fresh apples whenever we wanted them. When we checked in, I requested extra towels, pillows, a fan and ice, and they were delivered in less than 10 minutes, and it was midnight! Great service. My in-laws were given a room a little small for their comfort, and next morning when we talked to Javier at the front desk, we were told they would change them to a larger one, and not to worry about the luggage (many!), that they would move it while we went on a tour all day long. They indeed did so and moved all my in-laws luggage to the new larger room and when we arrived that night, they were given new keys and everything was taken care of and they went straight to their new room and found all their belongings in order. My in-laws were very happy with the change. It was done in a smooth way and Javier always made us feel welcome and went out if his way to please our needs. Again, excelent service! Included in the rate was a continental breakfast, which is served in the restaurant area and it includes juices, milk, cereals, pastries, hard boiled eggs, yogurt and fresh fruit. Some people complain the hotel is not in the middle of the city, but it is just one block from the beautiful City Hall, and the the hop-on hop-off tour bus has a stop right in front of the hotel, which saved us a ton of money on cabs since these buses run every 20 minutes sharp and go all around the city center.

We are in a suite on the 7th floor in a queen bedroom with a large plasma TV & full private white tile bathroom. There is a sitting room with French doors, a sofa bed & small plasma TV & a second private bathroom off the sitting room. The foyer doubles as a kitchenette with bar sink, very small micro., bar frig, plates, cups, glasses, cutlery for 4, wine, bottle/can openers, large knife, dish clothes and liquid & a coffee maker. Coffee packets are supplied each day as is maid service. There are 2 built-in closets, one in the bedroom, the other in the sitting room. The suite is set up to accommodate 4. It is spacious for 2. We are in an end unit which is very quiet except for the occassional siren. The Continental breakfast is the same each day with the only variation in the flavor of the large muffins. There are 2 cereals - Cheerios and corn flakes - hard cooked eggs in their shells & not rubbery, sliced melons & bananas, cottage & cream cheeses, bagels, tomatoes, yogurt, coffee & o.j. Mid-afternoon there are warm cookies; and apples are always available. We had Valentine's Day dinner in the hotel's French restaurant Ovations where breakfast is served. Dinner was excellent! We had duck breast and duck leg confit which was delicious and authentically prepared. A real surprise. The house Pinot was also very good. As written by others, the IATO is in the heart of the performing arts venues. Our room overlooks the SF Ballet. The IATO is also convenient to public transport. We left our rental car at SFO, caught the AirTrain to SFO BART to the Civic Center, exit the BART on 8th St. It takes half an hour on the BART from SFO & costs $8.10 p.p. We will return to SFO the same way. The Civic Center BART is a few blocks from IATO. Care should be taken after dark around the Civic Center. There are many reasonable restaurants near the IATO, as well as Absynthe, a French restaurant. As walkers, the location is not as convenient to tourist venues as other hotels but is quieter. Taking the Muni to Bernal Heights took half an hour but walking back only took 45 min. plus a stop for Turkish coffee at Philz; so for walkers, the location is fine. The staff is very friendly and helpful, whether the desk staff or the cleaning personnel. The desk staff has a list of restaurants that will deliver to your room, although Ovations provides room service. Our room was refreshed daily with mid-week sheet change. If there is anything negative, it might be the cost of parking at $25 a day & no on-site exercise facility.

The customer service star from that day forward was Rowena who anticipated my every need and treated me like royalty. When I overflowed the tub, fresh towels were at my door within minutes. When I was too tired to go out, I got take out and room service menus. And after arranging my airport shuttle for my early morning departure, she made a point to say goodbye since she would not be on duty when I left. How sweet is that! The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Huge baths have plush robes and there is a small but functional kitchenette with place settings for four. The mini-fridge was perfect for keeping my ferry market purchases and chilling wine. My room had only two windows, but plenty of lighting. I did hear some sirens (a fire station is nearby) but otherwise the room was quiet. Being in a metro area, I would expect some street noise like this. Although I travel with a noise cancelling device, I never had to use it here. The location is fairly convenient to public transport with a main line 2 blocks away on Van Ness and another about 5 blocks away on Market. Cabs are available by phone (which the front desk staff happily arrange) and arrive within 10 minutes or so. They have free internet and a computer near the lobby with a printer for boarding passes, maps, etc. Not exactly a business center, but adequate and accessible 24/7. Not much to do/see in the immediate area except the Opera/Ballet which I did attend. Everything else is a 10-20 minute cab ride or tram away. I paid about $10 per trip for taxis and the three day transport pass for the rest was $18 and available for purchase at the city hall 1 \u00c2\u00bd blocks away.

Confirmation promptly arrived by email. When we arrived, we met with the following: \"Hmm, I don't see your booking for the Opera Suite. I will call Javier (the same person who confirmed the booking by email) for further direction...please have a seat in the lobby.\" After 10 min. of lobby simmering, I asked what she was authorized to do to accommodate us, as clearly, there was a problem that was not being solved. She offered us the Symphony Suite with complimentary parking. We accepted, as we had dinner plans in an hour, went to our room, took showers and then the same desk clerk showed up at the door to announce that Javier said we could either move to an Opera Suite (that miraculously had become available) or continue with our present arrangements with complimentary parking. We stayed put as we had to leave for dinner and were in robes. Argh! On the positive side: very quiet, great central location, excellent parking valet services, and everybody was very polite.

Apples and freshly baked cookies greeted us every afternoon when we returned from exploring San Francisco neighborhoods. The complimentary Continental Plus breakfast is a great way to start the day. The ballet and symphony halls are one block away. We found the public transportation very convenient: bus stops are only half a block away and vintage streetcar, trolley car and BART stops are three blocks away. The cable cars are only a few blocks away by bus. 1- 3- or 7-day MUNI passes are economical and quickly more than pay for themselves. Also, this area of San Francisco is very flat so it's easy to walk around. Ovation restaurant right in the hotel serves delicious meals beautifully served in a lovely, romantic atmosphere. In the background is live gentle jazz. Other restaurants are nearby within easy walking distance, but we were so enchanted by Ovation that we didn't try them.

It is an all suite property right off Civic Center, War Memorial Opera House and Symphony Hall in the posh Hayes Valley area. Welcome area and lounge area are decorated in classic tone and completely charming boutique feel from the beginning of the boutique hotel booms in the industry. The first staff I encountered at Front Desk was not uniformed when I arrived at a quarter past 1PM (a bit early for check-in but it was Sunday and the city is running lower occupancy in hotel industry, so I thought I could give it a try). Of course, the room/suite was not ready. I stored my belongings with the hotel and off my errands in the city. I was told that the room would be ready by 3PM. I returned to the hotel around 3:30PM and was given room 35 after 10 minutes wait by the Front Desk to get someone to acknowledge me. I got the key within one minute and off I went to the classic SF apartment cozy elevator. As I got off the elevator, I almost hit the robe (not sure if it is clean or not), hanging by the door that enters to the wing my room located. I carefully walk around it in the Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s narrow hallway. It indeed reminds me a bit like many of the city sponsored apartment buildings around SF, except the price tag for this hotel was way much higher. As I walked past an opened door with housekeeper inside to get to my room, I knew that my room would not be ready (this came from my experience working in Sales & Marketing department in a two major hotel chains in US for 10 years). The bed was not done and the room had a really bad odor. I turned around and went back to the Front Desk. This time, I was noticed right away. I informed the staff that the room given to me was not ready. They radioed the housekeeping department and I was told that the room was ready after they got the confirmation from housekeeping. I told the FD staff that the bed was not made so it could not possibly be clean and ready. One of the FD staff went into the office behind the desk and later I was given another room - Room 55 on 5th floor. This time I did not encounter the dirty linen hanging from the door and did not notice any housekeepers on this floor. I got into the STUDIO and was really shocked. The kitchenette area was efficiently in front of the door. To the right, there was the bed that I would be crashed for the 2 nights. There was no working area or desk. The tiny night stand houses an old lamp, the house phone, standard hotel radio/alarm and a pile of magazines/hotel information directory (I gathered as I did not want to get more shocks with the 3.5 star hotel accommodations). The armoire right in front of the bed has a VCR-TV combo, few drawers and hangers. There was no safe deposit that could be found as most 2-5 star hotels would have across US. The iron and iron board are tugged away next to the armoire and the mirror wall (YES, the mirror wall that can be found in some road-side motels often with a big billboard offering honeymoon suite by the hour!) On the other side of the bed is a classic armed-chair sits between the window (going out to the fire escape) leaving a bit of room for me to walk by. The studio is really tiny comparing to most hotel rooms I have seen in San Francisco (one of the hotel chains I worked was in the city) but this room is to suppose to be a STUDIO and the hotel names itself as a 3.5 star resort. I was truly disappointed but I told myself to make do since I am only staying two nights. I tried to put away my suitcase and all my belongings since there was not much room to walk around in the bedroom area. The armoire can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be opened all the way and hit the end of the bed when opens to 60 degree so I carefully tugged my bag in the armoire as well as the portable heater it was left in my room. The bathroom was decent size comparing to my sleeping quarter but I would only consider it was efficient not luxurious or nicely decorated. It does appear to be clean and everything seems to all attached, however, the rose color shower curtain stands way out in this all ivory/creamy colored bathroom. I looked again in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website and made sure that I was not making any mistakes on my research before booking the hotel. I found there is some rooms in the hotel SMALLER than mine, called Ballet Room for efficiency travelers (I however had hard-time to image any room smaller than mine). For my type of studio, it supposes to have two chairs and a desk or table according to the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website. I told myself that there is no way, the hotel can even try to put in another chair or a desk/table and still advertises this studio as comfortable for two people. I pulled over a pillow as my desk on the bed and sat on the one and only chair to make it work as working area. The resort/hotel is not deserved 3.5 star as I have seen 2.5 and 3 star hotel in the city that are more spacious, clean and well d\u00c3\u00a8cored. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how the hotel pulled together to get the star rating from AAA and passed the standards as required. Shell Hospitality managed a few great resorts so I was really disappointed that this hotel can be part of Shell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world of elegant resorts and vacation homes. The rate for the studio was low but I know that I can get some other hotels with less star rating but more comfortable setting for travelers. My back was getting stiff just to sit on the chair and work on the laptop for one hour, a business traveler definitely would not be able to use this property for the business trip.", "Date": "April 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cbooked 2 nights 3+ months in advance and was relocated by hotel at check-in!\u201d", "Author": "tinkmommy", "ReviewID": "UR27515228", "Content": "A disappointing experience.

A little old; but it just adds to the french charm! I loved the decor, too. Our room was very clean and comfortable. The blankets, pillows and bed were all very comfotable and easy to sleep on. The bathroom is also very nice, but there wasn't much space to store my cosmetics, so I ended up putting some of my stuff on the floor. For the most part it was quiet at night, except for early in the moring around 6:00, we could hear someone start a shower. The breakfast is great. Where I come from there is no way you can find such a great price on a good hotel; especially one that offers such a nice complimentary breakfast. The resturant downstairs called Ovation is soooo good. I highly reccomend trying the creme brulee. It's out-of-this-world! The service from the maids is great. However, I was dissapointed when we were told our room would be ready by 3:00pm but it was not ready until after 4:30. That had me quite upset because we were wasting precious time in SF. Also, the hotel is not located within walking distane to any attractions, so that made traveling kind of difficult. We rented cabs for the most part, and the hotel was very good about calling cabs for us. Overall, The Inn at the Opera is a great place to stay with good food and service at a great value.

Especially if you can get a great price on Hotwire - it's in the Civic Center/Hayes Valley neighborhood for those who are familiar with how Hotwire works.", "Date": "June 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat little hotel\u201d", "Author": "myownparis", "ReviewID": "UR13549265", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for part of our honeymoon (5 nights). We loved this little hotel! Yes, the rooms are a bit small and the bathroom was very small - but it was definitely enough room for the two of us. It does have a very European feel , which I absolutely loved. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. One of our favorite things was the fresh baked cookies they put out every afternoon. They also turn down your bed, put on a lamp and leave chocolates on your pillow. The complimentary breakfast was pretty good, I never saw anything wasn't fresh or spoiled. Although, as previous posters have stated, it is a little annoying that they seem to expect a tip for breakfast service, especially since it's 99% self-serve! We just tipped $1 for each of us each morning we ate there. We did eat breakfast at a restaurant on the last morning, but it cost us $30! One evening we ate at the restaurant and the food was delicious - some of the best French food I've had. We would recommend eating there if your budget allows (a little price, but worth it!). The concierge (John) was extremely helpful and very friendly, too. The location isgood, only 2 blocks from the subway and a short distance from several bus stops.

We reported this & they brought 2 PORTABLE HEATERS to the room(this made us believe that this was a known problem to them). We thought we'll make do with this.Wrong. While ironing our clothes the electricity \"tripped\" in the room since apparently their system was obviously overloaded.We were left in the dark & cold. We tried to make do & reported this the next day. They came but did nothing & basically left us with the portable heaters again. To make a long story short we tolerated this for FIVE NIGHTS & then they offered to move us to a similar room when those residents left since they said it'll take a while to correct the problem.The move was good (to the 6th floor)but by this time I was personally fed up.While we were on the 6th floor, we heard residents in the room we vacated the same day & which was right above us!Obviously they didn't fix anything, so as I said before, it seems that the problems are pre-existing & they just don't fix it. For the nightly rate charged one should not have to tolerate this.Like one of the viewers said there's a \"tip\" bill folder for the \"complimentary breakfast\" which they presented with alacrity each day. This was a great annoyance to me.Additionally, the breakfast was boring(mostly produced from boxes & packets) & were cling-wrapped for each consecutive day .The breads were STALE...I even saw some mildew on the bread & the CUT bananas were also recycled(one could see the browned edges).Our new rental car was dented & badly scratched by their \"valet parking\" & they pretended to not have any knowledge of how it was damaged...we had to complete a report with our rental car company....luckily we had full coverage on the car.Internet which is located in the lobby area (totally not private)was non-existent...forget about having any connection in your room.The staff are friendly but that doesn't compensate for the aggravation we had to go through.Don't think we'll stay there again.", "Date": "January 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Idaho", "Title": "\u201cNot My First Choice\u201d", "Author": "Judge250", "ReviewID": "UR12170798", "Content": "We were there for a week, had to cut it one day short because of family.

The virtual tour on their website is an accurate depiction of the room, but note that there is a mirrored wall that makes the junior suite look like it has two beds. We would stay here again, but not through a time share exchange - -since it's not a resort there were no on-site amenities that we usually experience with an exchange. The continental breakfast was OK for a day or so, but they never change the offering, so you'll become bored with it after a couple days.

A 'tab' folder is placed on your table after breakfast with a paper in it indicating a tip is suggested. When you are there for a few days you observe the waiters sense of anxiousness as they await to open the 'tab' folder.

We were delighted with the hotel. The rooms are smaller than most people are used to but we found them very cozy and nicely furnished. I didn't find the bathrooms small. The breakfast we had was better than the usual continental breakfast. It has several kinds of cereal, muffins, bagels, toast, danish as well as hardboiled egg, pineable, watermelon and cantalope, banana and several kinds of juice as well as coffee. More than enough to start the day. Breakfast was in their lovely restaurant, Ovations. Room service was a real bargain and the food was from the Ovations kitchen so it was very good. The front desk acknowledged the rooms were small but they said they try to make up for it with fine service and I would say they did that excactly. Guests were invited to a wine and cheese party during the week so you could chat with fellow guests and meet the management. The hotel is in a very well lite area right across from the City Hall and near the Opera, Symphony and Ballet so there is always something going on and people around. The area in the direction of Market St is not the best but the other direction toward Gough has very nice restaurants and shops. Restaurants that were recommend were Citizen Cake and Indigo. We used a 7 day pass and used it a lot for cable cars, buses & trolleys. YOu don't really need a car but the hotel has a garage if you need one. We took a Wine tour through a company called Supersightseeing and it was less crowded than a Gray Line tour that we ran into. Our tour guide (Steve) was wonderful and very knowledgeable. Good place to see on your own or walking tour is Pacific Heights with its Victorian homes and great views of the City. Stop at Union St. in Pacific Heights that has some great cafes and boutiques.
