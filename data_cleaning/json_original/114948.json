The interior is gorgeous and the parking attendants and night staff were incredibly helpful. I thought I'd definitely like to stay here on future trips. Our first morning here, I was ready to head out with my kids to get a Starbucks as I'm an avid coffee drinker. I saw several hotel guests walk in with Starbucks so I knew there was one within walking distance. One of the guests told me it was very close. I stopped by the front desk to ask for directions to the nearest Starbucks. The response I got was frankly rude. There were two people at the desk as well as the door man. After simply staring at us for a moment, they told me that there is a Starbucks at the Crescent hotel (two blocks away), but that it is closed on Saturdays. I asked if they were sure because I saw several guests walk in with Starbucks. The man said absolutely it is closed on Saturdays. I asked him for the next nearest Starbucks and he gave general directions. My kids and I walked a couple miles before I called the Crescent and found out it is indeed open. We walked back to Crescent got our coffee and went back to Stoneleigh. I informed the front desk that the Crescent is open and they might want to tell their visitors such when they ask. The gal looked at me blankly. No apology for the inconvenience or thank you for informing them so they can give their guests the correct information. No hospitality, no friendly service - rude. My husband and I travel a lot and stay in very nice hotels. Next time we will stay at the Crescent.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cexcellent business stay\u201d", "Author": "mattgid", "ReviewID": "UR127982139", "Content": "from the valet staff to the house keepers, great service. hotel is in uptown and walking distance to the nightlife; didn't eat there nor drink at the bar, but all looked good. didn't do any spa services. very nice room clean remodeled; would stay again; recommend for business or pleasure", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fayetteville", "Title": "\u201cSuperb property, superlative service\u201d", "Author": "Rex N", "ReviewID": "UR127806868", "Content": "Just concluded another stay at the Stoneleigh and wanted to share some comments on this somewhat unknown jewel of a hotel. First, the service - each time I arrive the valets know me by name, have a smile and ask if they can help, this has never happened to me in any other hotel (as a result I've gotten to know them well) and is a great first impression for the Stoneleigh. I don't know if the staff has daily training on arriving guests or they just have a naturally great staff, but from the front desk to the concierge to bartender and Bolla waitstaff they provide great service with a smile and most seem to know me by name. I eat breakfast there on occasion when time permits (Texas Benedict is truly unique and also wonderful), and asked for a slight change to the menu item one time, since that time, I've been asked without fail \"would you like the Texas Benedict as you ordered before?\". Again, this is unique in my experience and speaks to both the tenure and professionalism of the staff. A quick review of the room itself: They rooms are very nice with comfortable beds and great linens, and the soaring ceilings of a property built long ago. Although there are many different room configurations, and all the rooms I've stayed in are spacious with very good closet space and a super nice bathroom including great toiletries. The walls are thick and I've never been bothered by noise from a guest next door. As expected in hotel in this category there are nice flat screen TVs and reliable wi-fi. One of the most important qualities in a hotel is cleanliness and the Stoneleigh staff does a great job - my room is always sparkling and fresh. I could go on about all the other items that make for a great hotel - have never run out of hot water, plenty of water pressure in the shower, etc. The hotel lobby and bar are uique and have great seating which is unusual and ecletic, but provides for good people watching. The bartenders are knowledgeable and friendly. The hotel has kept the qualities of its heritage while integrating technology, and providing great service. Stay here once and you'll be back! One important item to me is cleanliness", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cStylish boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "Emily0717", "ReviewID": "UR127546245", "Content": "Fabulous boutique hotel - loved the decor.

I posted a great review of The Stoneleigh a while back. But I have since changed my mind, and this is why: My daughter, who lived in Dallas, got married last September. I must've made a trip to Dallas at least once a month for a year and always stayed at The Stoneleigh because of it's convenient location, great rates and it was a nice hotel. We booked 40 rooms for the weekend of my daughter's wedding and held a party the night before for over 100 people on their penthouse floor-using The Stoneleigh's food and beverage. Even when I wasn't staying at the hotel, we would go there for drinks either in the bar or on the patio. We also referred many friends to stay there. I don't know about you, but I think that added up to a LOT of $$$$$. My youngest daughter and I stayed at The Stoneleigh last weekend while visiting my middle daughter. When I arrived, no one offered to help with my bags, upon checking in, there was no recognition that I was a return guest, much less having spent thousands of $ the past year at the hotel. I was pointed in the direction of the elevator, not shown to the room, etc...(not that I needed that, but it would've been nice for someone to ask). During my entire stay, the toiletries or mini bar were never refilled or replenished. There obviously were 2 people staying in the room, but only 1 bed was turned down. I couldn't get the free wifi to connect and called reception to help. I was given some instructions that I had already tried, I said I would just figure it out, she said OK and hung up. We met some friends in the bar for drinks and the staff were unfriendly and rude. I had breakfast in the Bolla Restaurant the last morning before checking out. I was pleasantly seated and then waited and waited for a waiter to acknowledge me. I had to ask a bus boy twice to send my waiter-and I was only 1 of 2 parties in the whole restaurant. After my food arrived, he never came to ask if everything was OK. I also had to flag him down to get my check when I finished. At this point, I was boiling. At least the food was good. The Stoneleigh Hotel is a gorgeous deco hotel-the public rooms are beautifully decorated, and the guestrooms are large and spacious. The only thing this hotel is lacking is SERVICE. There is none. I should say that I was told by one of the valet's-with a scowl on his face, that new management had stepped in about 6 weeks ago, and things had changed for the worse. I will give a shout out to the Valet guys-they were the best part of my visit. They were courteous and called me by name and always knew which car was ours. I'm not asking for special treatment or want to be a VIP, but it seems that somewhere, someone would see a guest profile and recognize that we've been regular guests of The Stoneleigh and would, at least, be welcomed back. I was very disappointed with my visit. I'm not sure I'll return.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful historic hotel\u201d", "Author": "lallen2882", "ReviewID": "UR127362403", "Content": "This hotel was a fantastic place to stay in the urban area of uptown Dallas.

Meh. Not bad but you can do better within a ten minute walk. Bar is small but seating spread out in the lobby. - Unfriendly staff? Not really.

Well, it's not a LaQuinta, but then again it's not a LaQuinta. Yes, there is the occasional sense that they don't need to overcharge for absolutely everything, but it is in the center of uptown Dallas. Lots of money. If you want cheap, head to the suburbs.

Considering you're already paying $300/room, and I had two rooms, it seems a little unnecessary to do that for each room when I'm already paying with a credit card (might be reasonable for a debit card I suppose).

Nothing was unacceptable, but for the price point I'm just not sure it quite meets my expectations or matches the quality of other places here locally in the same price range. Both my wife and I also went to the spa and had a great experience. I am not typically a \"spa\" type person, however I have to say having had a very nice massage here I can see why some people are. I would say I'm more inclined to have a massage in the future having had one here. The only thing that took me by surprise was the gratuity charge that showed up on our bill when we checked out of our room. There was a mandatory 20% gratuity charge on top of the fairly steep prices for their services at the spa.

The hotel has beautiful decor and a clean and spacious rooms. With its location it would seem to be the perfect hideaway in uptown. I booked our stay for late August to celebrate a 15th wedding anniversary. Just a quiet getaway from the family featuring a couples massage and a nice dinner. Simple enough you might think. I made my reservation over the phone and booked a room with a massage a hotel reservationist. Just a normal room and a massage, no problem. About halfway through the week I decided to move a bit more upscale on the room and went online to change the reservation. The reservationist failed to fill out the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mr.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the reservation on their system and the web form would not allow me to update the reservation without it, nor could I enter the required data. I called the hotel and was routed to an offsite service who had absolutely no clue on how to correct the reservation. (really now, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that their job?) the service suggested I call the hotel directly and ask to speak to an in house reservationist. I did so, and requested the upgrade. For some reason or another they could not change the reservation in the system, but had to cancel it and start over again. This in itself didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be an issue, after all it is just a room and a massage. After 20 minutes I was told the reservation was complete. We arrived on the Saturday afternoon and were impressed by the facility and the room. Strike One: At 5:00 we went down to have our massage. Immediately we knew there was an issue. They had no therapists. The hotel reservationist failed to recreate the massage appointment! The Spa manager was very professional, and finally traced the system and figured out what happened but could only offer us a rain check she knew we could never use. She did however attempt to bring staff in to perform the massage but was unsuccessful in finding two therapists. I believe she did whatever she could, but was also at a disadvantage from the beginning. Strike Two: We were quite disappointed with the end result and notified the manager on duty of the situation, and our dissatisfaction with the end result. He said he would look into it. We never heard back from him during our stay. Strike Three: A few weeks later I received a satisfaction survey where I expressed the issues and concerns. Nothing ever came of it. 10 days later I wrote directly to the management staff and again nothing. Back To The Dugout! While I imagine this is not a typical issue at the Stoneleigh, it does point to a greater issue of organizational and customer service arrogance. If I had never made a change to the reservation I would most likely have been fine. I realize issues happen, but the way management handle these issues is what turns an unhappy customer, into a repeat customer. In this case the management choice of inaction speaks volumes. Looking at this example I would never book the Stoneleigh for anything other than an overnight stay. If they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a basic reservation right then why would I trust them with anything more important?", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rowlett, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAn Oasis in the Middle of the City\u201d", "Author": "lsneed62", "ReviewID": "UR118602333", "Content": "Definitely one of the nicest hotels I have ever been to.

Thinking the Stoneleigh was a 5 star hotel, expected the same for the spa. While services were okay, expectations were extremely far from being met. When we checked in, recieved our locker with spa robe and slippers.......only to find slippers were mismatched. Okay, an mistake most likely made by housekeeping. I really wanted to overlook that one. Soon after, received treatment from therapist who didn't seem to care about my comfort. Asked if there were another room or for options since cold air was blowing directly on me, therapist said they did all they could..... by stuffing towels in the air vent! Not the 5 star quality I was expecting. Then, to make things worse, therapist never checked in to see how her pressure was. I could have said something, but was fully expecting it to be all about me. It wasn't, at all. Had to feel like I had to ask for everything. Later, enjoyed the rain shower and spa bathtub. Although tub took way too long to fill, once it did fill was relaxing and nice. Could have used some cold towels to put on my neck/face during soak or even a cold bottle of water. Once through with soak, got up to discover towel was totally freyed on one side. No apologies or real effort to make it right - only a \"you could of asked us for another one\". Towel appeared clean, however, again for 5 star the details were missing. No real amenities like hair ties/clips to use while in bath, and once you got out, only 1 hair dryer to fight over in the dressing area. No steam room or sauna in this facility either. No plastic bags for bathing suits, after asking for that I felt I really asked for alot. Again, attention to detail really missing.

We had both stumbled on the Stoneleigh separately, so we knew this was the one. What a treat! The Stoneleigh is a recently refurbished 1920s building, with a nice blend of art deco, modern, and traditional decor. The staff were great, and made us feel genuinely welcome, especially our concierge, Anthony. The room (a corner room) was incredible, with a dressing area, sitting area with a fashionable couch, large sleeping area with a nicely appointed king bed, and a *huge* bathroom. The sitting/sleeping area was bathed in light from the huge windows. The bathroom was like being in your own spa (although if you are sharing with a friend, the clear shower doors make sharing the bathroom tricky if one or both of you are modest!). I'm so used to staying in conference hotels that the turn-down service was a nice surprise! The high point of our stay was working with the concierge, Anthony...he was so accommodating and informative (and cheerful)! Love him! One of the drivers, Cliff, was also a hoot. Have him tell you about his experiences driving celebrities... We only ate at the hotel for breakfast, and it was a lovely experience...great food, classy service, and glam decor. I felt like a movie star. I didn't have the time or the budget on this business trip for the spa, but would love to try it out on a future stay.

When I arrived at the hotel, I asked if there was self-parking available. There is no self-parking and Valet is a whopping $21.00/night! When I got to the Front Desk, I was warmly greeted by a gentleman named Angel. Though noisy from the happening bar, I was able to check-in ok. Angel offered me a Deluxe King Room. When I got to the room, I noticed that while, wonderfully appointed; it was a little small for my taste, but I am spoiled from all the upgrades from being an SPG Platinum. When I called Angel to see if there was anything else available, he asked me to come down and work something out. While he had upgrade for large extra fee per night, he was eager to keep me coming back here instead of the W or Le Meridien and upgraded me for free. He put me up in a Studio Suite, and what can I say? Fabulous! Here are some some pros and cons: + Beautifully appointed room + Environmentally friendly... They have paper laundry bags instead of plastic + Solid wood furniture + Classy look + Free Internet (Pretty fast during peak hours too!) + Service is very friendly and fast! (Angel is very eager to meet your needs) + Room is very clean, found no hairs left behind in bathroom + Brightly lit bathroom + Baroness Cali toiletries + Scale in bathroom (Rare thing now-a-days) + Turn down service, but no mint or chocolate. + Valet fast car retrieval - Valet only option at a whopping $21 a day! Le Meridien and The W don't charge that much. - No comforter available, extra blankets can be requested (It's almost winter!) - No complementary bottled water. Pay to drink - Need more available outlets by the work desk area - Can be noisy with traffic in the morning - No frequent stay loyalty program Overall, I was really impressed with this hotel, and I would definitely recommend this place for a personal or business stay.

We arrived early on a Saturday morning around 945 am and didn't expect our room to be ready. After eating brunch we returned and were told that although our assigned room (a mini-suite) wasn't ready we were going to be upgraded to a \"Signature Suite.\" We were given room 300. Unfortunately our room key card didn't work. A manager let us in the room and told us that maintenance would come fix the lock immediately and would bring us new key cards. The room was very nice. It was a large corner room with lots of windows. Upon entering the large bathroom I realized we were in a wheelchair accessible room. There was no bathtub, just a showering area in the corner that was surrounded by a shower curtain. I don't think the room was much different from what I had originally reserved other than being slightly larger (to allow wheelchair access) and being a corner room. The decor was very nice, classy and modern but not so modern as to take away from any of the history of the hotel. The rich woods of the bed and dresser matched well with the turqouise in the carpet and curtains. The was a minibar, a flat screen TV, and a safe.

When we returned several hours later the key issue had been fixed. The bed was very comfortable, we slept well. Breakfast at the hotel restaurant, Bolla, was fantastic.

I am rarely disappointed by recommendations from TA users, but am in this case. Just returned from a weekend stay with my wife and on one hand the decor and ambience of the hotel is very good. However, there were a number of service gaffes that I would not expect from a top ranked hotel. On the positive side, the lobby and bar area are well done. We had a smaller room with a king bed and the decor was very attractive and new. So physically, the interior of the hotel is beautiful. However, I had higher expectations of service where the hotel really dropped the ball. Arrived Friday afternoon and room was not ready. OK, and they did call later in the afternoon to let me know when my room was ready. Asked to have our bags which were left with the bellman delivered to the room. Returned to the hotel later to get the room key and found my bags were not in the room. Called the front desk to tell them and was told the bellman would deliver them. They did not arrive. Called again and was told the bellman was unavailable and they would have someone else deliver our bags. Got another call to the room as they then could not find our bags. By this time we were going to be late for our event that evening. Finally the front desk employee brought the bags himself to the room. Went back down to get our car from the valet and we were running late. All parking is done by the valet for a $20 daily fee. There were three valet parkers and one went to get our car and then came back and asked what our name was as he could not locate our car. Another 15 minutes and we are even later for our evening plans. We did not try the spa this trip, but I got such a poor first impression on service and stayed in other midtown hotel properties where I did not experience these service problems that I more than likely will not stay at this hotel again. There is condo construction right next door associated with the Stoneleigh and although we were on the 7th floor, there was sufficient noise even during the evening from surrounding establishments heard from our room. Last comment, while the room was nice. I did not enjoy the placement of the AC vents which oddly enough were across the room from the king size bed but blew directly in our faces while in bed and the vents were not adjustable. Not a huge disappointment, but not deserving of the top ranking of Dallas hotels in my opinion.", "Date": "September 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Del City, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cTop Notch\u201d", "Author": "KaptainKool", "ReviewID": "UR19544232", "Content": "Very nice and comfortable. i would give it excellent but the parking was under construction. the valet was nice but not much room to drive.that was the only inconvenience. great rate for specials. large plasma tv and the rooms were big and comfortable. breakfast was pricy but good. nice lounge. friendly and helpful staff. we did not have time to use the spa though. location was good, north of downtown. if you can make it through the dallas construction then it is well worth the stay. a great romantic weekend getaway for a couple. i did not see any children. did not walk anywhere. north of the hotel is kinda seedy but south looks nice. will definitely stay again.", "Date": "August 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat pedicure!\u201d", "Author": "alice1964", "ReviewID": "UR19471147", "Content": "I stayed here for two nights and loved it!

In addition the staff does a very nice job of welcoming guests. I had one of the studio suite rooms. It's one large room divided by a large wooden double sided dresser with a flat panel TV on top. The bed is located on one side and a sofa and chair are on the other. You can adjust the TV to view it on either side. The bathroom is one of the nicest I've seen in Dallas. The marble floor and tile walls had a very clean look. The soaps and shampoos were top-tier. In addition, there were plenty of towels and they were very soft and clean smelling. The bed was very comfortable. It was turned down in the evening when I returned to my room, along with a robe and chocolates left out for me. There was also an ample closet, with an ironing board, starch, etc. The air conditioner in my room was a bit finicky at first, but seemed fine after a while. The hotel also offers your choice of papers in the morning - the WSJ, NYT or DMN. (I suspect they'd find a Star-Telegram for you too, if you asked). The hotel is easy to get to from Love Field, though your only real choice is valet parking. The hotel has a small but active bar in the lobby. In addition, it's fairly close to most of the downtown restaurants, etc. If you're looking to mix things up a bit in your trips to Dallas, this is a great new place to stay downtown.", "Date": "July 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel, not as convenient as staying downtown\u201d", "Author": "kkbenton", "ReviewID": "UR17199021", "Content": "I'm spending 4 weeks working in downtown Dallas and staying at 4 different hotels. The Stoneleigh is definitely the nicest - the rooms are a step up from the Adolphus, but it was somewhat inconvenient for getting downtown. Its a quick drive, but considering the overnight parking at the Stoneleigh is $21.65 and then daily parking downtown is $15-20, it makes more sense to leave the car at the hotel. That means either cabbing it, taking the bus, or the trolley. The walk involved with the trolley was too far in business clothes and the trolley is not air conditioned (not good in the summer.) You can catch the bus right outside the Stoneleigh and it dropped me off a block from the building, but its a jolting, bumpy ride and you have to have exact change, in cash. IMO, there's a big difference between this hotel and the Adolphus - everything about the Stoneleigh was updated, pristinely clean, and top notch. They did turn down service with chocolates, had these great robes, and flat screen TVs. They actually provided starch with the iron. I really enjoyed the comfortable seating on the front deck. Its also a quick walk down to the Katy Trail and the park on Turtle Creek. Most of the restaurants within walking distance are pretty expensive. We had pizza and salad at Coal Vines for $25/each. It was good, but ouch! Mattitos was good and more reasonable. One issue I had was the design of my room put the bed right next to the door and the room was very close to the elevators, which made for a noise problem. I was also woken up at 4am by a hotel employee using a 2 way radio right outside my door. Check Expedia for prices - it was $130/night for the week I was there.", "Date": "June 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - Renovated\u201d", "Author": "saintba", "ReviewID": "UR17139214", "Content": "I just finished a 3 night stay at the Stoneleigh Hotel & Spa in Dallas. I booked the hotel from their website and booked a Studio Suite. I had to come into town for a meeting and also to do some shopping before heading to New York. I was flying from Buenos Aires and the flight got in very early at 7 AM. I emailed ahead of time and asked if I could check-in early and one of the managers, Anita, confirmed it would be fine. The hotel is in a great area conveniently located in the Uptown Area. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very close to downtown and also you have quick access to the Tollway and also Highway 75. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also close to Highland Park where my friend lives so it was convenient. The hotel has recently been renovated and the hotel got a nice write up in the Wall Street Journal last week. They just finished a $36 million renovation. The lobby isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything over the top but nice. I never stayed at the hotel before the renovation so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t compare it to before but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice. My room was very big with 4 large windows, a king size bed, a big 46\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 high definition TV, nice bathroom and a walk in closet with plenty of room. The bed was very comfortable as well. My air conditioning wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working right the first day and I complained and they sent up a maintenance worker right away and he confirmed it was just blowing air and fixed it. The staff was always very friendly. My only complaint/problem was the first day I called down to ask for some razors to shave (I forgot to pack them). The front desk confirmed they would send someone up with some. They never did even after 3 calls down to the desk. They kept saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153someone is on their way up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but they never came. I would have just preferred them saying they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any if they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Also, the biggest problem is the valet parking area. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely small and not well organized. Most people coming in town will probably have a rental car as taxis aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too common in Dallas compared to other large cities. They charge u$s 21 per day for parking which is common in hotels in this area. The problem is that people come to the hotel for dinner to eat or to have drinks in the bar so that parking area is a total zoo. The guys seem to try but they had some problems. I called down to have my car ready and sometimes they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it ready and one night I had to wait almost 20 minutes for my car. 1 time they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find my keys. Also, the night that it was really hectic was a Friday and I went out and drove to nearby Highland Park to pick up a friend for dinner and I noticed the valet guys left someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car keys in my front seat! Fortunately I was going to dinner at Craft which was close by so I stopped by the hotel to drop off the keys. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine if I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice them and bring them back what the hotel would have done for this guest/customer if they wanted to leave. I found this a bit troubling. Really the only complaint I had was the valet parking situation but the hotel was great. One thing to note is they are building a building next door to the hotel so there is a bit of noise in the morning and throughout the day. If you want to sleep in and are a light sleeper, keep this in mind. All in all a great hotel with friendly staff and comfortable rooms.", "Date": "June 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Stay for Anniversary!\u201d", "Author": "ztraveler-6", "ReviewID": "UR16853111", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here one night for our anniversary!

What a beautiful hotel. They aren't exaggerating when they say a 40 million makeover. We had to wait for our room, and decided to have a cocktail. When paying our tab, the manager came over to tell us that the hotel was picking it up due to the wait. NICE! The rooms are HUGE. The room has a king bed on one side, a sofa area on the other - it's divided by a credenza with a flat screen tv that turns between the room. There is a huge walk in closet and a nice big bathroom. When leaving for the hockey game we went to get a cab - instead the house car (nice NEW Mercedes) pulled up and offered us a complimentary ride to the center. No charge - but we did tip $10 for the ride. The only negative is the amount of construction in that area - I'm never bothered by noise - I always have my earplugs with me. Just a heads up to anyone who books anywhere in downtown Dallas. Oh - and the rooms don't have coffee makers - just pop down to the bar where they have a complimentary coffee bar set up.
