I also heard they were servicing the elevator, which had some people upset on the 4th floor because it was noisy, however I had requested to be in a quiet area and they put me on the first floor far away from the elevator. Breakfast was pretty good, coffee/tea/ hot chocolate, cereals, bread, oatmeal, pastries, bagels and cream cheese. Good basic continental breakfast. Also, free internet available in the lobby.
