(maybe about 15mins by foot) nice view at night as you can see the lights from the cable car. if you hungry at 3am, you can buy the food at the 7eleven. if you want to go to the universal studio, dont take the bus infront of the hotel because its not worth it. too near to pay for $1.2. but if you travel with old people or kids, take a cab.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur", "Title": "\u201ci believe there's better option!\u201d", "Author": "Beryl-KL", "ReviewID": "UR120311076", "Content": "1st step in, the room was small, but we don't complain as it looks tidy and clean with the price that we paid.

Rooms of this hotel are too small. They initially gave me a room with no windows... it felt like being in an elevator ---- claustrophobic. So I upgraded to a family room with 1 double bed and 1 single bed but it turned out that the family room is just a meter bigger than the regular room they initially assigned to me... well, at least this one has a window. Cleanliness is ok.. but it needs to improve a lot on comfort, but then again, i realized this is one of those by the hour-hotel.. so you get to see fast a turn-out of guests coming and going in couples. The walls are pretty thin too though it seems sound-proof from the traffic outside. This hotel is located near the main road, I did not hear the traffic outside but I heard the next door's noises--- the oohhs, aahhhs and laughter and talking and talking.. so if you book here make sure to bring earplugs. Also bring some airfreshner... or i guess it was just the time of the month that my nose gets awfully sensitive as the halls smell musky with stale-smoke and I think needs airing. The cost? --- a bit unreasonable considering you get the same from a backpacker's hostel.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cTerrible & Horrible Hotel Service Staff - Ida\u201d", "Author": "shahroh", "ReviewID": "UR76300575", "Content": "Worst ever experience with hotel service staff named Miss Ida ... totally unprofessional, rude and incompetent staff.

The receptionist was kind enough to help us put our luggage first before check-in time as we arrived in Singapore quite early & would like to proceed to Sentosa first. Very small room but we manage to have room for our prayer(solat). The rooms are really clean despite the small hotel & without breakfast. During the nights is quite inapropriate to me as it slightly turns out to be like motel for young couples. luckily my nephew & nieces didn't ask anything as they were too tired during our outing. Very convenient for budget travellers & only need place to sleep. It's ok as you can splurge on other things like food & activities in Sentosa.

I chose the place because it was a SG $1 bus ride to Vivo City or a SG $6-8 cab to Resort World (Casino/ Convention/ Universal). Staff were very good, very helpful. With its price I expected comfort. I'm not even talking about a huge room here because you don't expect that in Fragrance hotels nor other budget hotels. But for a budget hotel it wasn't really budget at SG $370 for 3 nights. The beds were hard and so were the pillows. :( We asked the staff if they could replace at least the pillows into a softer set but they apologized to say that their pillows were like that. But since we were always exhausted coming back at night, we dozed off anyway. Just wished they had fluffier blanket/ comforter as well.

There is a 7 eleven right below adjoining the hotel, but without a fridge you can not store cold drinks Second issue is the wireless internet, like 10 hours for $10 ....in reality you don't get 10 hours for $10, as its determined by when you activate the wireless connection.. its 10 physical hours. So if you activate at 12 noon, it cuts out at 10pm. Bad luck if your out shopping from 2pm to 7pm Another point that if you want extra towels or such, don't bother with the front desk, ask the guys doing the rooms...or you be waiting all day Another point, is there are no display of brochures of local attractions and things to do in the foyer, I actually went to the hotel next door and obtained what I wanted there.
