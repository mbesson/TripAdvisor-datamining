I was very satisfied with my stay. The staff is efficient and helpful. The room was not fancy but everything was clean and in working condition. There is a supermarket in an adjacent building. That was very useful as the restaurant and restaurants nearby are not open on Sundays. Econtel is in a residential neighborhood and other restaurants are some 10 minutes walk away. The internet was fast and reliable. My only discomfort was that the heat was barely warm enough during my stay which included a period of hail. Although breakfast was 13 euros I had it all three days. I thought it was tasty and good value. I had dinner in the Econtel restaurant the first night because I had flown from the US west coast. I had the currywurst dinner which included a beer for about 9 euros.

Before I get into the details I want to share with all who might be thinking of staying at the Econtel in Berlin. The hotel is located in a great location next to bus lines and a few minuets walking distance to the Charlottenburg palace and its beautiful garden and safe biking paths (the hotel rent bikes at a great price, 7.50 euro for one whole day) and not to mention the hotel's incredibly yummy buffet breakfast... heavenly! The rooms are a bit small but I don't go to Europe to stay in hotel rooms all day. Here's my only small gripe. All the receptionist working at the front desk. It saddens me deeply to say ANYTHING bad about the hotel, for I have stayed with them on 4 different other occasions when I had vacationed in the beautiful city of Berlin. I'm not what you might call an overly sensitive person but when I see people giggling for what seems to be for no apparent reason I worry my fly might be unzipped, or maybe I have my baseball cap turned sideways on my head. I noticed these fits of giggling on 3 occasions throughout my stay at the hotel. I felt offended. I can't recall wearing a clown nose or oversize large red floppy shoes. If this is what made all the receptionist chuckle I can appreciate this but I wasn't wearing any such items on my person. Maybe I am way too overly sensitive, or, maybe I should have asked them what the bloody hel* they were all laughing at?! I felt like Rodney Dangerfield. Anyway. I absolutely love Econtel Hotel Berlin, I highly recommend anyone to stay there. Anyone who isn't bothered by random outburst of giggling from well-dressed unprofessional desk clerks. Important note; In all my stays at the hotel this was the only time I was slightly annoyed with the new faces who are now working at the Econtel Hotel Berlin behind the reception counter.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Slokram", "Title": "\u201cJust so so...\u201d", "Author": "Nearykourouysrolanh", "ReviewID": "UR102325546", "Content": "That's is my second time staying here but they don't care wether return guests or not and they just treated guest as normally.

He suggested this hotel telling us it was a 3 star location. It was far from 3 stars in my book. I will say it was clean and the staff was very friendly. The room was crazy small and not at all suited for small kids with 2 beds being bunk beds. All were twin size. The pillows were flat and lumpy. The bathroom was like being in an RV. We are not large people and my shoulders bumped the walls while in the loo and shower... The rails on the bunks were cardboard like wood- not very safe for a 5 year old to sleep in. We asked for a larger room but they said they could not help. We had a tough time getting the TV to work. When it did decide to turn on we couldn't really see it because the bunk bed blocked the view. The breakfast was very good. It seemed fresh with lots of choices and the staff was nice in the restaurant and at the front desk. My reason's for the low marks are the size of room- lumpy beds and pillows. It was also very cold. It seemed as though the heat cut off after 7pm. We had our heat turned up to the max and still were chilly. There were a few ethnic type restaurants nearby and it was very close to the bus/train stop. I found this part of Berlin to be a bit dirty and run down compared with other parts of town that we saw. Lots of litter/broken glass ect. If you are looking for clean and cheap this is for you. If you are looking for a 3 star hotel....HA!! it's NOT!

The breakfast was outstanding, like most of the times in German hotels. The rooms were ok and clean, but a bit on the small side.

However, when you were as tired as we were by the end of the day, it didn't bother you THAT much. Other than that this hotel was very good!
