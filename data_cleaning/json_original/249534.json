I too was concerned after reading some reviews but my fears were unjustified. This area was quiet, convenient and a GREAT bargain. So much space after being cramped in a hotel room together! Did not go to pool but it looked fine and was being used. Since the condos are indivually owned and managed you will need to do more research, but the condo community itself was great.

Was a little worried as after I booked our apartment at Grand Palms I saw some really bad reviews. So relieved when we got there! The apartment we stayed in was 8836a Grand Palms, which we booked through DVRO. It was clean and well equipped. The communal swimming pool was lovely. The sun beds were comfortable and spotless.

Looking at a few negative reviews I thought I would share our experience which was positive. We found the Grand Palms to be well maintained, with a nice uncrowded pool area and a hot tub as well. The grounds had an area for grilling dinner and an area where the kids could play. Units will vary as they are individually owned but ours was nice. We found the location to be perfect, only a few minutes to the Disney World parks. I would recommend this complex to anyone, we are returning for 12 nights again this May.

Tried to put my guests in the master bedroom but was appalled at the filthy bathroom and moved them to the other bedroom. Things were not even close to what was promised. This was not anywhere near an upgrade from the calypso cay condos or the Mike Ditka resort which is what I originally called about. In either location or quality. Carmen you describe this to me as luxurious, only if you would put a rundown days inn or knights inn in that category. I was embarrassed to have my guests stay there. We were also held hostage for a cleaning fee. Our initial discussion was that there would not be one. It was discussed and I was quoted a price for three nights which was less than 2 nights plus the cleaning fee. You assured me that I would not be charged if we only stayed 2 nights. I again asked when you called back asking for a second credit card authorization for the taxes to be paid directly to you, and was assured there would be no additional charges. If we had not had tickets for an event in two hours after our arrival, and it was new years eve I would have walked out. I tried to have maint correct the internet problem but was told he could not switch the non working modem and could not access passwords for other available signal.

This unit is very \"dated\" inside with just about everything in it. Old tv's, furnishings, kitchen appliances, etc. All Linoleum floors were filthy dirty and sticky. Ground in dirt all over them. They really need to be replaced. Carpet looked vacuumed but couldn't really tell if it was clean because it was dark green. Yuck! We invited a couple and their 2 year old to travel with us down to Kissimmee so we'd thought we'd be nice and let them have the master bedroom with the king bed and private bath but was that a mistake. They complained the bed was so uncomfortable and on top of that their shower/ bath tub had a moldy shower curtain. Wow, what a way to impress our friends. I can say that the second and third bedroom beds were not too bad though so my wife and I and our son slept pretty good. The pool was pretty nice. Not large but was adequate for our needs. Well I could go on but that's enough for now. All in all the condo was just ok I suppose but really needs some serious updating and cleaning. I can say that we all had a nice time at Disney though just didn't enjoy the condo so much. Hopefully Global will drop this unit if the owner doesn't make appropriate updates to keep up with the times.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cUnits 8820B vs 8819A\u201d", "Author": "luvwater", "ReviewID": "UR91449927", "Content": "My husband and son stayed at 8819A this Spring and really liked the condo so we reserved a 3 BR for an early Christmas get-a-way for the whole family. Unfortunately, 8820B was not a corner unit and it was also on the 2nd floor - lots of luggage to lug up & down. They both agreed that the other unit was better but each BR did had a TV in it along with the big flat screen TV in the living room. Kitchen was newer and clean but the carpets were very worn and needed replaced or at least cleaned better. And, the master bathroom was very small, i.e. toilet & shower/tub in small room with sinks off side of bedroom. The linen seemed to be pretty threadbare in all bedrooms and master was the only one that had a comfortable mattress. This unit was closer to the pool, hot tub & exercise room - so we didn't have far to walk.

Obviously there has been new management since the last reviews here. I am up at 2:30am writing this review because the people that left yesterday in the unit next to us thought it would be funny to set the radio clock alarm for the middle of the night on a heavy metal station as loud as they can. That wouldn't be so bad if someone could get in the room to turn it off. There is no management on site. No telephone number connected to any office(calling the phone number listed in directory service says it is disconnected). We rented through VRBO through Global Connections. Global Connections \"emergency\" phone number is an answeeing service and they have a maintenance/service phone number but will not give it out because the info they have says it is only good after 8:00am. I walk the entire property and there is no phone numbers listed anywhere except the security guards station at the main entrance, which is never occupied, and that phone number goes to a voicemail box.

It is the best place we have ever stayed. We liked that the villa was one story; no steps to go up and no one walking around above you, making noise. There was a washer and dryer in the garage for your use (not coin operated). You couldn't park your car in the garage, but if you stayed at a hotel or whatever, you wouldn't have a garage there either. It had a nice screened-in porch, lots of space, great beds and plenty of towels, etc. The pool area was nice and was never very crowded while we were there. They also offer tennis courts and a nice gazebo area near the grills. It was very clean and well maintained. The rate is unbelieveable! We only paid about $80 a night in the middle of July for two bedrooms/two baths and a sleeper sofa. The management company we rented through, Sun Country Villas, could not have been nicer. We did not book very far in advance, so we had to make full payment at the time of the booking. They didn't take the credit card I wanted to use, but they held the condo for me until they received my check. It is off the beaten path a little bit, but we enjoyed being away from all of the traffic at the end of the day. There is a grocery store about a mile away. The only slight draw back was that you had to walk a little ways to the grill area.
