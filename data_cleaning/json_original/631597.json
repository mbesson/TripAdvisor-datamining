The room was spacious and clean. The bed was very comfortable. The pool and hot tub was crystal clear. The staff at the front desk were particularly helpful and super nice. My husband loved the warm cookies that were served in the lobby. There was a refrig, ice maker, stove and microwave in the room. The little store by the lobby had enough food choices that you could buy and heat up in your room and the prices were reasonable. Because of the Superbowl there was transportation available into the city. Otherwise the hotel is very close to the airport and a convenient car ride into the city. I'm not going to rate the hotel on value because for the super bowl everything was inflated and I have no way to compare! Indianapolis did a great job preparing the city to host the super bowl.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bloomington, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cI like this hotel\u201d", "Author": "Chunyang", "ReviewID": "UR119499710", "Content": "It is quite near the Indianapolis airport so would be a excellent choice for those who want to catch up with airplane.
