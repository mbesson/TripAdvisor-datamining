When we arrived the valet guys seemed like they had nothing better to do than harass us. We checked in and later that night I wanted to have a bath. To my surprise, tge tub filled with green water. We called the front desk and they sent someone up to check. The guy who came said it was the city's problem and left. The manager called and said the water was safe and we explained we did not feel comfortable bathing and brushing our teeth in green water. We asked him for another room and to check it first. We waited an hour and got impatient because it was midnight. We called and they said they had one room but the water was green too. We asked for a discount or something and he said he would drop off some breakfast vouchers. We woke up to no vouchers under our door and had to call and explain a couple more times the situation. What an ordeal. They gave us continental vouchers. What an insult. We confronted them and they gave us a full breakfast.

At first impression, I am not sure if they are going for the nostalgic dark decor, but the hotel had a sort of antique features and dark wood, with low lighting. We had to find someone to take our bags to our room as there was no doorman when we arrived and only one conceirge with the trolley full of luggages, so we had to go up the elevator to the main lobby and wait for the concierges there. From previous tips from this website I requested a high level bay view which the three of us received. We were very happy and amazed from the views. The rooms were of substantial size and had all the amenities except for a minibar, although there is a ice and drinks vending machine a few doors away. However, my Uncle was unfortunate to get locked in the bathroom and had his wife call maintenance to unscrew the door to let him out. They fortunately were able to change rooms later that day. The rest of the group had no problems with the room. We had dinner on our first night and was throughly entertained by our Egyptian waitor (cannot remember his name) but we really enjoyed the evening. Breakfast was ok, however the variety was limited but I did expect it after reading the previous reviews, so I was not surprised. As a vegetarian, I did fill up on fruits and bread, however the savoury foods only limited me to scrambled eggs and oatmeal. Would have liked beans or hash browns instead of pancakce rolled up with creamy cheese! The staff were helpful and the internet service was good as it was free if you are a guest. The gift shop was also good as well as the bar in the main lobby, however it did take long to get our order as there was only 1 bar man serving...he gave us complimentary drinks for waiting so long. The surroundings were ok, no problems there as we mostly took taxi around town, we did try the mono rail which was exciting but a bit scary at the freedom tower stop, a guy was screaming which led me to believe he was mentally insane, there are no barriers from the platform so be careful as it does get windy up there. We went on the city tour and the Orlando day tour as recommended by Danilo the concierge. We enjoyed the boat city tour, however I would not recommend the Orlando trip as it was a nightmare. The main journey took 3 hours (expected) however if you are going to the magic kingdom, you have to transfer to a mini van, which the driver then took us into the car park of a supermarket area as he had to wait for a guy who was buying the entrance tickets, we had to wait in the car park for 10 minutes, at this time after travellig 3+ hours we were furious as we were told we would get at the park around 10am instead we arrived at 11am, thus cutting short our enjoyment at the park. We vented our frustration but the driver said to complain to the company and muttered in Spanish. We tried to enjoy the rest of the day. The tickets should've been purchased prior to the day. The following days were uneventful and we went on our cruise. Lambert the doorman was thoroughly considerate.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port of Spain, Trinidad", "Title": "\u201cChristmas Business Trip\u201d", "Author": "Nis N", "ReviewID": "UR126343227", "Content": "Hotel was ideally located for the purpose of my business trip.

It's located on Biscayne Blvd, which is a ten dollar cab ride from the port. Located downtown, it's about a 15 minute stroll to Bayside, 5 minutes to the opera house, and 10 to AA Arena. There is also a train station nearby that offers free train service around downtown Miami. In addition, a cab to south beach would take approximately 10 minutes. The room we had was spacious with two comfortable queen size beds. The room and the washroom were immaculate. Your view will obviously depend on the side you're on, and we had a view of a drive-through fast food joint looking onto Biscayne blvd (I believe). Since we weren't in the room much, it didn't matter. Wifi is available in the rooms, but for a price. However, free wifi is available in the lobby. The service was excellent, from the bellboy, to the service desk, to the concierge. All were very helpful and gave us great info about getting around. The only complaint I have is that I could hear the elevators all night long as our room was only a few feet away. I suggest requesting a room further away from the elevators.

I was in the hotel for 3 days during an admittedly busy boat show; but you would have never known by the pace or attitude of hotel staff. I have never in my life seen such generally lackluster service throughout a hotel. The desk staff were generally courteous, but simultaneously disinterested and unpleasant. The concierge was one of the more helpful employees, along with one of the bellhops I encountered. That all being said, the rest of the hotel staff and premises are a disaster. Allegedly some renovations were done in the not so distant past, but you would never know except for the random granite counter tops and thresholds. The bathtubs are all old and appear to have been painted; which is peeling. There was an abundance of mildew in the first (bath)room I stayed in - so much so that i had to change rooms. Both rooms were absolutely disgusting. You can see dust CAKED into all switches, fixtures, etc. There is also generally a lingering \"goo\" on clocks, table tops, etc. Apparently none of the housekeeping staff's vacuums work, because I have never seen such a disgusting amount of hair accumulated in corners, on tile floors, in carpets; and unfortunately on \"clean\" bedding. This is the kind of hotel that should include a full body condom at check in for your safety - really.

You can see dust floating and reflecting off the sun light for hours to come. If you have the misfortune of valeting your car, prepare yourself for the worst and most unprofessional experience ever. We had to depart/return approximately ten times and never waited less than 10 minutes for the vehicle. You can actually observe as the valets slowly stride around without a care in the world and as if no one, includin them, has anywhere to be. Of course the valet is a third party from the hotel, but i believe the hotel should take responsibility for the valet's behavior on their property. Needless to say, the valet refused to surrender my car during departure and treated me like a thief by saying my valet bill had not been paid, even though we had a paper bill printed moments before showing it was.

I waited in the Hilton Honors line, which was shorter than the other line. After about 5 minutes, I was helped. Front desk staffer was very nice, saw that I was a Hilton Honors Gold member and quickly informed me of the complimentary welcome reception and breakfast at the executive lounge. He also noted that I requested a room by an ice machine and replied that he was sorry but they did not have any rooms left. He then upgraded me to a one-bedroom suite. When we got up there we realized it was actually two separate rooms with a connecting door, one with a dining and sitting area, bathroom, and a gorgeous view of downtown Miami. The other room was a regular guest room which was a good size and had a comfortable bed. And yes, we were now near an ice machine. The upgrade was very much appreciated. We did not make the breakfast because of the race timing, but the welcome reception was very nice. The executive lounge also had a nice view and offered hot and cold appetizers, water and soft drinks, along with wine and beer for a reasonable price. Very nice feature.

Although I am a diamond member we were not provided with any water (as the policy states for H Honor members) and I had to call 3 times and wait for 30+ minutes for two bottles of water. We decided to check out and change rooms the next day. As we were checking out I discussed my concerns with the one of the front desk supervisors (at least that is what he claimed to be) and all he said to me was I am very sorry! Nothing more!

On the second day the valet employees ignored me when I went to drop my car off, they left my car running while they sat there and talked, wasting my gas. The thing that made me upset the most is on the last day when we got into my personal vehicle (not a rental) it smelled like a homeless person slept in there!!! My car had been rummaged through, and I really felt violated since I had personal effects in there. I am now taking it to get the car detailed since it smells so bad.

This is especially true for 3 and 4 star hotels. In this sense, the Hilton Miami Downtown is exactly what one would expect. We stayed here on two different occasions during a recent vacation to south Florida. The first visit was kind of strange. First, the room we were given, so we were assigned a different room, which was upgraded to a King Suite at no extra charge. The room was huge, beautiful, and the view was awesome. It was a corner suite with floor to ceiling windows all the way across two walls. The view of Miami and the bay was stunning. We were also overlooked at the hotel restaurant when we stopped in to eat dinner. The staff, upon realizing the oversight, went out of their way to make up for the mistake. My wife and I were very pleased with the hotel and the restaurant's efforts to make amends for errors. Everyone associated with the hotel - valet, bellhop, desk clerk, housekeeping, etc. was tremendously friendly and accommodating. The same for the restaurant and lounge staff. The concierge was helpful, professional, and friendly. Nothing but good things to say about the staff and customer service. On our second stay, we got a standard room. Not nearly as nice as the suite. I definitely recommend the suite...especially if a person is interested in viewing the sights of downtown Miami. The Good: The rooms are very nice and very clean. The location is right downtown, and centrally located. The pool is on a rooftop and very nice. Parking is simple (valet). Staff is outstanding. The price we paid was very fair (prepaid on the hhonors website). The Bad: Parking is quite expensive, valet is really the only option, and everyone seems to have a hand out for tips. (I don't mind tipping, but the excessive tipping got a bit old.) Going from the ground to the lobby to the rooms is not at all convenient, and actually quite a trek. No continental breakfast, which is typical for this category of hotel, but am used to Hiltons and Hamptons providing breakfast for Hhonors members. No free internet in room. There is free internet in the lobby, but it's $10 a night in room - even for Hhonors guests. No hotel shuttle to/from airport. Expect to pay at least $25-$30 for transportation to/from airport to hotel. All in all, this hotel probably offered the best value, quality, etc. for a downtown, centrally located hotel and we would definitely recommend it to others and stay here again.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel with incredible customer service\u201d", "Author": "hashemsview", "ReviewID": "UR118240188", "Content": "After 4 days at Walt Disney World followed by 4 days cruising from Miami to Key West to Cozumel and back to Miami, we wanted a great place to relax.

The lady at the nice enough to give my daughter an OJ even though it wasn't normally offered for snacks and only for breakfast. Of course, as in all other downtown hotels, parking is over-priced and I believe self-parking is almost as expensive as valet so I went with valet parking with unlimited ins and outs. There was one little bump in my stay, my room is a connecting room with the other side also occupied. The neighbor was a bit loud in the music playing but it goes with the connecting room so I can't really complain too much. Then I smelled cigarette smoke leaking through the connecting door. The smell gets stronger and stronger and I have a preganent wife and a small child so I called front desk and confirmed the hotel is a 100% smoke-free hotel and told them about the smoke. The manager was quick to investigate with security staff. Minutes later, the manager is back at my door and told me they have resolved the issue with my next door neighbor and asked me if wanted to switch room.

When we arrived at the hotel we asked for our upgrade that we requested via the Hilton homepage when we booked this hotel and we got it. The view from our room facing the water was MAGNIFINCINT especially at night. The staff at the hotel is really helpful!!! One day my husband and I went to the pool but we forgot our Ids and keys in the room. The reception staff helped us immediately getting into our room with the help of the Hilton security guard so that was a nice touch. And on the other day around 10 pm my husband accidently closed the connection doors between our our bedroom and living room so all our stuff was locked inside the other room, we called the reception and they sent a specialist who knew how to open the connecting doors to our two rooms so I was impressed since it was a bit late at night when we asked them to help us. The positive: - Very experienced and helpful staff - Breakfast was great! If you don\u00c2\u00b4t have a voucher like we did the price is 16 dollars per person. You can have fruit, tea, coffee, fresh juice, pastries, bacon ect from the buffet or order from a menu. - The pool was heated but it was SMALL. -The hotel is located near the buss station and the rail way The negative: The car rental service SUCKS! We asked the Hilton concierge to help us to rent a car. The Hilton don\u00c2\u00b4t have cars so they use Hertz in Miami Downtown. The concierge called Hertz and made a deal with them that we can rent a car for one day, with GPS and FULLY ensured for 109 dollars BUT when we the next day got to the dirty office of Hertz they played stupide and they started a new car rental request for 179 dollars. So my husband and I were both chocked and annoyed. SO don\u00c2\u00b4t bother with the Hilton car rental service, Obviously their cooperation with Hertz is NOT WORKING. Just go to Hotel InterContinental Miami downtown they have much butter car rental service with BETTER deals and they also provide Hilton guests with a special discount.

Do NOT stay at this property. Let me explain that the staff of this hotel is the worst I've seen in my entire life. From the moment you arrive at the Hilton Downtown Miami you will realize how bad everything is here. First you will have to get passed the infinity of teenage groups, you will arrive, eventually, to the lobby. At first, we thought we had arrived at the \"wrong time' and things would improve later...we were wrong. This is a nightmare. The lobby is constantly busy with teenager groups. The lobby is the only area where there's free wi-fi (and they call themselves a 4* property !) so expect tons of people, sometimes on their pijamas (!!) in the lobby, some of them, sitting on the floor with legs spread, etc. Just awful. The rooms size is good and views are nice but it ends here how good these rooms are: housekeeping do not clean these rooms, they \"tidy it up\" and that's it. There were breadcrumbs in the desk, the sofa, etc...and we had just checked in! Our friends had other 2 rooms which had pretty much the same housekeeping issues: weird smell from the closet, rooms hadnt been properly vacuum cleaned, etc. Want to move rooms? Good luck, staff the front desk are the worst I've seen in my life in the entire world. I do not share the same last name as my husband, so I made sure when I called from our room that they'd be ready for me at the front desk...my husband had already left instructions about my coming down to get new keys...yet, to my total surprise...they almost did not let me back to my own room despite my calling to reception a few moments earlier from the room AND my husband's instructions, and that's because I had my id with me, I can only imagine what else would they have me submitted if I didnt have it with me. The lady who had talked to me on the phone was just as obtuse as the clerk at the front desk. I had specifically called from the room, informed of the last name difference, they confirmed that I could come down and yet, after 2 minutes at the front desk...they act like they dont know anything! Outrageous! As to breakfast...this is another marathon...if you still decide to stay at this horrible property, make sure you hit the breakfast before 8.00am...afterwards is mayhem. Evidently I am aware that sunday breakfast at hotels can be busy...but to run out of milk ?!? It's insane. Staff try to be courteous but I suppose there's little they can do without the basics ! The only exception is a waiter of the restaurant, at dinner time, named Andre fernandes. He went out of this way to accomodate our request, very polite and quite frankly deserves a better employer as Hilton doesnt know what a gem of employee they have on their hands. My impression of this property is that they have a love and hate relationship with groups, expecially from Brazil. Hilton likes the fact these groups keep their occupancy high but equally hates them and have no idea how to manage such groups. Sadly, they extend this prejudicial attitude against Brazilians to other guests of the same nationalily. I was apalled to see how they mistreated another Brazilian guest, who was not part of the groups. As soon as he left, staff simply said comments like \" oh well...these brazilians are terrible\"...this is awful. The gentleman was just asking for directions for heavens sake. Our friends had to stay for a few more nights on that properly as it had been prepaid and they had no way of cancelling or getting a refund. Luckly for us, we managed to stay the rest of our stay in Miami at the Four Seasons (what a classy hotel!). I have no idea why and how the other reviewers have had a good experience at this property.

The furniture was disgusting. The orange chaise had stains all over it with something fresh dripping over the side. There was an inch of dust in the corners and along the back. The lampshade had yellow stains on it that looked like urine, smelled like urine. The sheets seemed fresh and clean..thank goodness. We politely told the lady who checked us into this room that we were not happy with it and she said that she was sorry, and that \"renovation\" didn't mean the furniture or fixtures. She said that she would tell the manager who was not available at the moment. He never got back to us and we were there for 2 days. There is a very nice bar and lounge area that we would have liked to take advantage of, but the chairs and seat cushions and covers were so dirty and stained that we wouldn't sit on them. The pool was nice and warm. Loungers were old and dirty. The restaurant staff were very friendly and our lunch there was good! The hotel is in a good location, close to the port if your going on a cruise and close to Bayside Marketplace. Overall, I am disappointed in this hotel and will never stay here again. Perhaps if we had been more aggressive about speaking with the manager and demanding another room we might have gotten a better response. Just didn't want to start our trip off like that. We have stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel in downtown Miami before and will stay there again. It is slightly more expensive, but worth it!

Let us start objectively. Property is well located for access to the port, the beach and downtown and for people without cars there is sufficient public transportation to get you there. The property is not the newest around but is clean and the rooms are exactly matching the star level the hotel advertises. You are not in a five star hotel so don't judge as it it was one. My own personal experience show the staff is being proactively trained by management to exceed in every possible manner guest expectations. This my first stay as HH gold after years of diamond so I was kind of stressed of the benefits I would get. Let us start with how they exceeded my expectation. I checked in on an award reservation (not paid stay) at 8 AM and I must admit approached the conversation at check in the most respectful and polite way and made the check in agent understand that I do not expect to be checked in before 3PM (THIS IS CHECK IN TIME) but if she could that I will really value that. Guess what she checked me in. Now that was not senior employee but I could tell a Junior employee and a Junior employee will only override the rules if the hotel itself has a policy to extend early check in when possible. She noted my status and gave me a gold key to access concierge. Coming back to our diamond member because i am really offended by his attitude: 1. Check in is at 3PM. Any minute they check you in before is a exceeding the normal check in time. You can start complaining after 3PM and with my case you can see they did would they been able to check in you in before they would have. 2. Your front office agent was smiling at you the whole time and most then likely was doing it in order to come over friendly to you. You really think in this economy and with his ethnic background he'll want to risk his job especially to get a complaint note from a diamond member. 3. In terms of your exec lounge access key. Check in time is at 3PM and the hotel is obligated from 3PM to extend you access. Not a minute before if they do not want. Now would you have kindly asked front office if they could issue you a key I am sure they would have but if you do not the front office person might have thought of it. From now on the hotel could proactively train their staff to allow diamonds early access to the exec lounge and this is if they want and if they do so this would really be again exceeding the requirements. 4. In terms of the room allocation. You need to realize that for some people who make quite less income have different expectations of a fantastic room than you have. I imagine you thought you would had a suite and understand your disappointment in that but if you had a room with a fantastic view of miami or even one of the nicer corner rooms that might be qualified for the front desk as a fantastic room. Don't attack the front desk guy for his subjective opinion. He could also have answered you at check in that check in as it 3 PM and to come back at 3PM. 5. In terms of your coffee situation. I would not have appreciated that neither but you have exec lounge access so instead of waiting 30 min (which is strange as you were in hurry) you could passed through the exec lounge and the fantastic attendant which was there would have done that for you. Or on the way to check out you could have stopped by the lobby bar, ask for a coffee and explain the situation. In terms of your complaints the only one that I would look at from management as an complaint would be the coffee but as you had exec lounge access and the option to go by the lobby bar it is not a MAJOR complaint for you to rank the property that low.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing and very clean\u201d", "Author": "vacationfamily101", "ReviewID": "UR103836693", "Content": "We stayed at Hilton Miami Downtown for 3 nights in April with a family group.

I was very very loyal with Hilton Hotels, and quite frankly 4-5 years ago the the Hilton Honors program was much better, but anyways, thats beside the point. The reason i said that was that the stay i had at this Hilton Hotel in Downtown Miami SINGLE HANDEDLY made me QUIT my Hilton Honors program. i was SOO upset, that i was like fc&* it, i called Marriott and already have 9 night stays with them in the past 3 weeks. So i arrive at this hotel at around 11:30 am, i ask if there is any rooms free, and there was this employee at the Front Desk ( I'm pretty sure his name was Fernando, and he was a short latin male). I asked him if my room was ready, he said that the room was not ready and that i would have to wait. I asked how long, he said he doesnt know. I mentioned to him that im a Diamond VIP member and if they have any other rooms free, i dont mind going into a room other than the one i requested. He said he had to go talk to the manager...5 mins go by, he comes back with a cheesy grin on his face saying \" wow sir my manager said they are able to give you a very nice room, but its not ready yet\".. its hard to explain, but the way that he said it was just like a sleazy used car salesman trying to sell you a lemon car... Its like he was talking to a little kid.. He took my credit card and wrote down my info to call me as soon as my room is ready, and asked me to sit in the lobby. First of all, its rude to tell your customers what to do, second of all, I SHOULDNT BE THE ONE ASKING HIM TO ( AS A DIAMOND VIP) GIVE ME A BLANK KEY CARD SO I CAN ACCESS THE EXECUTIVE LOUNGE ! He should be giving me access to the lounge so i can sit there while my room gets ready. Anyways, i asked for the blank key so i can access the lounge, i got a diet soda from the lounge and decided to grab lunch. I come back at 1:45, i ask the same guy if my room is ready, he said no ( again with a sleazy grin). I go to the lounge, get some work done, around 4:00pm i was like screw it, I already called the Conrad hotel they had room available, so i decided to go downstairs and ask one more time if my room was ready. I go downstairs, ask a different front desk staff if my room is ready, and i see the same guy ( Fernando i think) sprint from the other side of the desk and telling this staff he'll take care of it. He looks at the screen, types some stuff, and says \" oh wow sire the room just opened up, its a magnificent room, my managers must have done something right now in the back, they gave you a beautiful room\"... i swear its hard to describe, but he sounded SOOO sleazy, describing how magnificent this room that they were giving me was, and making it sound all my stars were aligned in order for me to get this room... i go to the room, and guess what, just a normal king size bedroom like i had requested. I was fu*&ing furious, I really couldnt care less about the room, he couldve just easily said \" sir i apologize but no upgrded rooms are available and we will just give you the king bed as you requested\" and i wouldve been fine, but to think im stupid and try to sell it like the entire staff was going ABOVE AND BEYOND, but really, its was just the front desk staff acting sleazy and thinking i was stupid and didnt know that this was the normal room they wouldve given me anyways. And next morning i wake up, kinda running late trying to brew some coffee in my room, there were 5 coffee packs in my room and i swear ALL FIVE WERE DECAF ! i mean like WTF, dont they go through a checklist for every room? make sure 2 packs of reg coffee, 2 packs of decaf .... Its just so unprofessional. I called the front desk at 6:05 to send 2 packs of coffee up to my room, at 6:35 i called them to say forget it, if after 30 mins they cant send 2 packs of coffee to my room, then im over it... Seriously, this hoteel, and the Front Desk staff at this hotel ( specifically that guy Fernando) single handedly made me say goodbye to Hilton forever ( not forever, i have like 600,000 points which i'll use for vacations), but i will never ever PAY to stay at a Hilton ever again in my life.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Upper Marlboro, MD", "Title": "\u201cGreat Views\u201d", "Author": "BC8-TC8", "ReviewID": "UR101867589", "Content": "My family and I stayed at the Hilton on March 12 (pre-cruise).

The taxi drops you off at street level, but you need to take an elevator up to the third floor to check in at the lobby. You then have to take an entirely different set of elevators to reach your room. Given the masses of people that may be checking in/out at the same time, it makes for some awkward/crowded navigation through the lobby from one set of elevators to the next.

It's a relatively nice looking hotel - probably used for conferences, as it has that 'conference' feel about it. The layout is somewhat of a pain in the rear, as you get in at the ground floor, go up a couple floors in an elevator where you get to the lobby, then walk around the lobby bar to get to the next set of elevators that go up to the rooms. Just seemed like we kept waiting for, or walking to, elevators. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Workout area was a little small, but had enough machines and weights for a hotel of this size. Pool area was nice, as was the lobby bar and lobby restaurant. Food and drinks were expensive, just to let you know. Most staff were courteous, but as per below, not all of them. Our flight arrived early, so we figured our 2 rooms wouldn't be ready. And we were right. It was about 10am and the front desk person said they were full the night before, so all rooms had to be cleaned, BUT they were cleaning one of our rooms right now and the other one would take a little while. Fine, we just needed one to change & drop the bags into. The sun was out, pool was open, and we're on vacation, so no problem. She also said we would be upgraded. I wasn't sure if it was due to my HHonors status or the email I got previously asking if I wanted to pay for an upgrade if it was available. Either way, all good. Well, 10 turned into 11, turned into 12, 1, 2, and finally got into our first room at 3 (which was the supposed-to-be-upgraded-but-wasn't room). Second room about 3:30. We really wouldn't have minded much if they didn't tell us 5 hours ago that it was being cleaned at that moment. 5 hours to clean a room? I don't think so. And the upgrade? Once again, don't promise something you're not going to deliver. Of course every time we went to the front to ask about it, it wasn't quite ready & they'd let us know... Location-wise, it's convenient for the port or for a Heat game. Unfortunately, location-wise, it's also very close to a run down / rough area of town. Every big city has it, I know, but it's really close. Even the Concierge told us to take a taxi back from the couple blocks away we were going (Bayside Market), as he said you don't want to be out in that area at night.

That night I had planned to go for canapes and drinks as I always do at Hiltons but the welcome letter stated that only soft drinks were available so I didn't bother until around 15 minutes before the end of service when I went to grab a coke. When I got there there was no staff to be seen and no drinks available. When I asked at reception they said that it had closed early. They offered us some breakfast vouchers for the following morning to eat in the restaurant instead but we had to ask 3 times for these, finally having to argue with the receptionist as to why we she should give us them! The hotel is in a really awful area. There's NOTHING nearby - we took cabs everywhere. There's a Burger King across the road which we went to once but the place was full of homeless people and it just did not feel like a safe neighbourhood. The hotel does have a decent little Business Centre with free laser printing which was useful. All in all I wish we'd stayed in another area of Miami (where there were actually restaurants and shops) or in Miami Beach. But this Hilton was so disappointing and we were treated so indifferently by an apathetic staff that I think we'll be taking our Diamond status to another hotel chain.", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alpine, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for cruisers!\u201d", "Author": "hiviolet007", "ReviewID": "UR95801450", "Content": "We picked this hotel because we wanted to have a view of the Port of Miami.

In my experience, a less than perfect hotel is greatly improved if the staff is helpful, friendly and accommodating. By the same rule, a decent hotel can become The Worst Hotel EVER when the management treats their guests as if they should feel blessed just to be there, and gives no guidance whatsoever to their staff. This is the perfect example. After a long day of travel, I arrived at the Hilton Miami to check in. I gave my name and confirmation number. A young man behind the counter turned and asked his 'manager' a question in low tones. The manager looked us up and down, checked to see the name of my company (I assume to see if I was important enough) , whispered something back and left the room without looking at us. The young man, visibly upset, turned and informed me that there were no rooms at all in the hotel. He told me I would have to be 'walked to another hotel'. I insisted there must be a mistake; I clearly had a reservation. I also told him that if he planned on moving me to another hotel, it would be one of my choosing. He fussed and asked me to wait. He asked me to sit in the lobby. I refused.Ten minutes later, he takes a brief call, looks up and tells me that his 'manager' says there is a room. Not a bay-view, upper floor premium room as I had booked, but a 3rd floor basic room overlooking a cement roof. No explanation how they went from no rooms to having a room. Just the overall impression that I should be thankful to have a room at all. I accepted, mainly because was exhausted and didn't want to fight. But what continues to irk me is that management had obviously screwed up and couldn't even be bothered to manage the situation. They made some poor new employee bear the brunt of an awkward and frustrating situation. I won't even bother to describe the bland room, the noisy old air conditioner or the desperate need for a paint job, because my stay was ruined before I even made it past the lobby. There are a lot of hotels to stay in while in Miami.

I am very critical when it comes to cleanliness and service as I work in the tourist business myself. I arrived late at night and asked if they had any upgrades avalilable as I had read that the view from high up was wonderful. For a few dollars I was upgraded with no fuss to a top floor room facing downtown Miami and Biscayne bay. The nighttime view was amazing ! Ordered roomservice which was fast and the food was delicious even though it was late at night. Went to bed, slept like a log on the huge bed and woke up to an even greater view in the morning. Room was lovely and big, tv was the old fashioned type but worked well. Bathroom was immaculately clean. The only gripes about the room was that there was no safe ( you had to go to reception to store valuables ) and there was no handheld shower in the shower/tub combo. Wifi was about 10 dollars a day and very fast. Pool area was lovely and the frozen drinks did the trick. I'm a smoker but prefer not smoking indoor and the hotel had 2 outdoor smoking areas with tables and comfortable chairs. The concierge was very helpful and only after I left the hotel did I realize I should have tipped him like I did roomservice and others( I'm from a country were tipping is not normal ). He helped me with info and bookings several times during my stay but never said a word about it and was always smiling and acommodating. So very good service from him. And the rest of the hotel had the same standards concerning service. My room was always kept clean, roomservice was fast and good and reception was always able to help. The hotel does not have a spa but was able to arrange inroom massage very quickly, something that was very much appreciated and needed after a 22 hour flight. The masseuse was professional and managed to work out the kinks. So if you need a massage you would do well to go with the service the hotel works with.

However, most people are paying more...AND... this is a Hilton...so there really shouldn't be anything wrong with it. #1 The location is so-so. Nowhere really to walk nearby. Parking is expensive. The hotel had better be a perfect \"island,\" or else. #2 Room service shuts down early...so you're really stuck if you get in late and are hungry. I had to get back into my car and rive to a Taco Bell. Not quite a full service amenity. #3 Valet parking, while pricey, was friendly and VERY FAST. Wonderful staff at valet parking. #4 They put me in a room right next to the elevators. I'm a friggen Diamond HHonors member. You didn't have anything else? C'mon. I'm always in Hiltons. I don't need to listen to \"ding ding ding\" all night long. #5 There were a TON of high school kids at the hotel on some group tours. WTF? Put them all on one or two floors and don't put them on mine. Colleagues' calls to the front desk at 2 AM yielded the response \"their chaperones aren't controlling them.\" Gee, thanks. Try planning this a little better so it's not so inconvenient for your other customers. Junior high or high school kids in large numbers are unpleasant in business hotels. The lobby felt like a gymnasium, and furthermore, these kids clogged the elevators all the time. #6 The Concierge Lounge on 16. Oh, the Concierge Lounge. Too often, the fruit salad was skunked. Hello, health department? This was not good. #7 The Concierge Lounge on 16. The women working here were super friendly and helpful. They made me feel at home. All of them were nice. #8 The Concierge Lounge on 16. The guys working here were all jerks. Really cold and unwelcoming. I think one guy was named Elvis. He would sneer at us (and other customers with whom we conversed and came to the same conclusion) and storm from table to table, demanding that we sign in or point to our names on the sign-in list. Jerk. I stay at Hiltons at least every other friggen week of the year, AND I used my card to get into the secured lounge, and you STILL treat me like a thief? Jerk. Jerk. Jerk. And I' m not the only one. All you had to do was look around and catch the eye of anyone else in there, and they nodded and rolled their eyes at the behavior of this jerk. Why is he in the room for your best customers? Another guy was using the computer set up for the guests to work on his resume one morning. Nice. #9 My TV was old. Very few channels. This is a Hilton in a major city. You should have a modern flat screen TV. C'mon. And have more than 10 channels. What an abysmal selection. #10 The guestroom doors do not automatically shut. There's not a spring mechanism to close them....so you'd walk down the hall and see multiple doors not fully closed. This isn't safe. I had a worker knock on my door (thankfully) while I was in the room and the door wasn't closed. This should not be. Anyhow, like I said at the beginning of this... in my particular case, the rate was only $79/night...so I recognize, this reduces my credibility in griping...but on the other hand, this is a Hilton and they should be doing a better job than they are doing.

Pool area although at roof level and could be quite a haven staff appeared once again overwhelmed at busy times - could not keep on top of towel demand and allowed guests to bring bottles/glasses into the pool area. One issue with the executive lounge access - hotel literature stated the lounge should have been open from 6.00 am - this was not the case and when we arrived on one occasion to grab breakfast before leaving for the day we were told to \"try later lounge not opening yet staff had not arrived\".

Pro: ++ excellent location, good connection to the airport, downtown, South Beach and Key Biscayne. ++ great restaurant, room service, friendly waiters and reasonable prices + clean rooms and bathrooms with nice beds and an overwhelming view + freindly personal in general Cons: - - - The valet parking company is a mess. We were given the wrong care twice and a couple of dollars were stolen from the cup holder (which was closed). The bucks were estimated to be the tip, so maybe it's their service to self-tip. Theft was reported to company, but did not reach anyone when dialing the number I was given. - - Our room was prepaid (booked with Expedia), which was confirmed three times when checking in, but guess what happend? Back in Germany the credit card was charged again, this time from the Hilton. Took a week get someone on the phone who was really helpful and delivered resultes, but finally the refund was USD 50 short and we are going into round two... Must be a business sissue between the Hilton and Expedia, but not favorable to me due to a lot of time and money spending for international calls...

There has clearly been a large amount of real-estate development at an unfortunate time for the economy, leaving this area feeling like a highly developed ghost town. That aside - the hotel: I am Hilton Honours Gold, and a one-time employee of Hilton in the UK, who I was very proud to work for. I was disappointed with the service in this hotel from the Front Desk to the F&B staff. The only employee who I thought was particularly service orientated was the Concierge. I put this down to the staff being unionised in the US - Management are afraid to tell their staff off, and are very restricted in what they can say or do. (I have various friends working in the Hotel Industry in the US who have confirmed this). Therefore, other than the career employees who are looking to move on in the industry (as I was) there is a tendency for the positions to attract 'lifers' who are doing it as a McJob, and nothing more - Hoteliers need to have passion for service, and there was none shown here. The free internet in public areas, part of Hilton's 'Stay Connected' program is great, but the hotel fails to capitalise on this market. The lobby was always full of people on their laptops, but you would have to BEG to buy a coffee, and mostly it was just not possible. The staff would say 'actually I am finishing my shift' or 'No, we have no coffee at the moment' - I was amazed, and remember, this is possibly the only location in the whole of the USA where there is not a Starbucks in walking distance. Hilton Downtown Miami - you are missing a good revenue opportunity here, and if you can't do it, why not sublet to a coffee concession? The internet was good - wireless only, which I can live with, but running on a clever system with good control over the bandwidth. I would have liked to see bandwidth options - a premium package would have been nice, as on occasions the connection was a little too slow, but ok.

Another tip: Don't consider this hotel if you happen to work odd hours. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too loud. I paid the Omni center $50 more dollars for the subsequent 28 hour stay (reduced from $60 because I was a hotel guest). No wonder this large multi-story is practically empty - those should be concert parking prices! - or European capital, not downtown Miami (technically, this is just north of downtown, to be specific, across the street from a Checkers and a Burger King). The room: Beautiful bay view and downtown made for a great photo (attached) - It was a shame that the window was so dirty. Whatever housekeeping are using isn't working, because you can tell that the person is quite short since at my eye level and up to the ceiling, the windows were clean, but left to dry from wet (with a dirty rag) from 5'8 down - unless John McCain was cleaning the windows, he has a medical excuse for not being able to raise his arms and it would be wrong to chastise his work if he were (disabled) housekeeper. I think the housekeeping staff, or maintenance, should use a squeegee, simple solution, or get a professional window cleaner - there should be several in a diverse, large town like Miami. I got an interconnecting room. My corporate system doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let me send notes and I always forget to state I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want that at check in. I could see light below the door when my room was dark and I could clearly hear the people in the next room talking and going to the bathroom. The Air Conditioning sounds almost identical to my Lawn Mower (room 1216) just a few decibels lower, or like my lawn mower if my neighbor had stolen it and was cheekily using it while I was in bed. Himia (new nick) tip #2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c crank the AC for an hour or two before you go to bed and seal the drapes well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the heat bleeds into the room from the ceiling to floor windows, then raise the thermostat so that you can go to sleep. TV: - I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen an old square button Zenith in years. If the TV gets any older, Zenith might buy them park for posterity, or some kind of new-age hip corporate campus artwork/sculpture. I forgot to check if it had faux wooden sides, but the red gun was definitely about to fail. An ambient buzz fills the room if the picture contains too much red and people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s skin seems to melt off their face \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even more so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re viewing Jersey Shore. Himia tip #3 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the ambient drone of a Stuka divebomber, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the TV Internet: One night I chose free, basic wireless access \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no problem, next day I read my hhonors diamond welcome letter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it said that apart from the boring \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re so happy to have you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd crap, that I was entitled to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free high speed internet access\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the charge will later be removed from your bill.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I paid $9.99 and I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be bothered standing in line again to dispute it, I left. Food: I only tried room service once, because at 10:30 on the second night, the phone just rang out. Day 1 was a Cuban sandwich with fries and a pepsi, it came to about $21.60 after the compulsory 18% gratuity + $3.50 delivery charge. I look forward to the day that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not relied upon to bolster employee salaries for doing their jobs, so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really mind the compulsory charge (not my money anyway) but I accidentally signed my name on the extra tip line and then again on the signature line. I can only hope that this was not construed as some sort of xxxxblock. Power to the people! and so on and so forth\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The sandwich was kind of salty by the way, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hoping it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the benefit of the pork, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m happy to report that my bowels are OK! <thumbs up> (in the air). As I mentioned, this hotel isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t considerate enough for people working unusual hours, both days there, I had the housekeeping cart parked outside my door for what seemed hours while the staff held conversations with each other down the hall and then loud radios continued to operate with sound wafting in from under my conjoined room (along with lots of hairspray from the guests next door that morning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they commented the brand, and both agreed how great it was and how they both used it, but I missed the actual name). Other, little, mostly whiny things: No body wash, no mouthwash, hair on washcloth. Toilet flush seemed to last for minutes, used gallons of water and continued during refill. I think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m done with Hilton brand, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not all about the room service (I usually have a car and often eat drive \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thru\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd like a plebian anyway), so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d much rather have a fridge. If I stick with Hilton for another million hhonors points, it will mostly be with other chains in the group, such as Embassy (not Southfield, MI tho).", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork", "Title": "\u201cNever again\u201d", "Author": "JudeCork", "ReviewID": "UR60765570", "Content": "overpriced, bad service, room smelled of dog, no restaurants nearby, bus ride to beach was an experience we never want to repeat again.

I am a member of the Hilton HHonors so I always stay at a Hilton property. Since our ship disembarked early, we arrived at the hotel at 10am. We were told a room was ready on the 1st floor so we took it. I had made reservations for a room with a King size bed but this room had 2 queens. We really didn't care, we were just happy to get a room that early. We were very pleased with our room. It was very large with windows all around and sliding doors that led out to a patio. Since we are smokers we enjoyed the use of the patio. When we first arrived there were broken beer bottles outside on the patio but it was cleaned up right away after I had let house keeping know. The room was clean and beds were very comfortable. We left our room the next day at 9am and headed to South Beach. We came back at 4pm and our room had not been cleaned yet. I was a bit disappointed but called House Keeping to have our amenities replenished but didn't bother getting our room cleaned since it was getting too late for that. The hotel isn't in the greatest area but everything is fairly close by. You can walk to the Bayside Market in about 20 minutes or take a cab. We really liked Bayside, had some lunch and did a bit of shopping. Nice lively atmosphere. We walked to the Double Tree just behind the Hilton for supper one evening. You can use the Skywalk to get there or walk outside. We ate at the Italian restaurant and it was great. Fablulous food and great service. The prices were good too. South Beach is a definate must if you are visiting Miami. Very lively and what a huge beautiful beach! Tons of shops, hotels and restaurants too. If you want to spend a night there be prepared to pay at least $350 per night. It was a $15.00 taxi ride from the Hilton so you won't break the bank to go by cab. The Hilton also has free internet stations in the Business Center which I used a few times during our stay. We didn't eat there but had drinks and cappacino's at the bar and they were very good. They have a lovely pool outdoors to use also with lots of loungers and pool towels. There is also a bar by the pool so we ordered a bucket of beers and soaked up the sun. Check out was fast and pleasant. We took a cab to the Miami International Aiport. The Hilton Shuttle is much more expensive than a cab so don't bother.

Here are a couple of examples: One of the dishes I wanted to order: \"Pasta with shrimp, garlic, white wine, herbs in an herb butter sauce\" I wanted something slightly healthier, so I asked if they could lighten the butter in the sauce, and they said yes. So, what did they deliver, pasta noodles with cheese on top--there was no garlic, no evidence of white wine, and no evidence of herbs. Another dish I ordered, \"Grilled Chicken breast, roasted tomatoes, olives, and basil on baguette\" (note I'm using quotations as these are actual citations from the menu itself...just so you don't think i had some twisted interpretation). I ordered this as I thought it would reasonably healthy, so the first order came with a huge amount of cheese--I mean the sandwich looked like nachos in a sense that was covered with cheese, so I sent that back. I noted to room service that there was no mention of cheese on the sandwich and they apologized but said this is how they do it and customer like it . Ok, fair enough, but send me what's on the menu. So for the 2nd order, here's what arrived: a grilled chicken breast on a bun with sundried tomato paste (probably from a can), and evidently the basil and olives are in the paste. Is it just me or wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t one expect to see some fresh basil and some fresh roasted tomatoes on the chicken breast?? The Internet connection was a bit intermittent over the four days I was there. It probably worked 75% of the time, but given that I'm there for business, that's not acceptable, especially if I'm paying for service.

In America, however, they are really just a 4-star hotel chain (e.g. Hilton Anaheim, how is that called anything more than 4 star?) as is Sheraton and Marriott. So, after reading the reviews on this website, and after looking at candid photos, we were pretty much prepared for the same thing; a 4-star hotel chain. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exactly what we got! Upon arrival, the hotel is right outside a drive-thru diner where the cops like to hang out. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a visually appealing area at all, and in fact, the hotel lobby is 1 floor above the street level (what the?). On the lobby level, registration desks and a souvenir store that looked like it has remained in the 80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sits with the restaurant, bar, and access to the pool (how can the guest be expected to go through the hotel bar to the pool area??). This hotel is another one that has been built in the 70s/80s and has had a renovation to try and keep up with the times, but really looks like a refurbished old hotel. The design of it shows that! We had 2 rooms on the 3rd floor and upon entry, the first thing that hit me was the sheer ugliness of the view. It is literally a large white roof from the building next door. The only thing that could have made it worse was old rotting air conditioning units. After closing the drapes to avoid more eye sores, the rooms are relatively spacious with 2 double Hilton Serenity beds, a coffee percolator machine with take-away cups (which seems to be the standard in US hotels) and a toilet which looks like it missed the renovation and also remains in the 70\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Whoever designed the toilet roll holder was an idiot, which is so far from the toilet you need to stretch toward the sink to get it. Once you tear toilet paper off and let it fall, the roll falls to the ground and soaks up water from the floor which had not drained properly. What the!?! The room also does not have a room safe, and for some reason had an iron, but no ironing board. The air conditioning was also a hit and miss \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our room was at a good temperature, but right next door it was constantly hot which meant turning up the air conditioning so that it was so noisy and smelt damp that you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really sleep properly, no matter what kind of Serenity bed you put there. Breakfast in the restaurant was quite limited, but I guess quite standard for an American hotel. What I completely disagree with at this hotel is the automatic gratuities charge of 18%, both at the bar and hotel. How can a gratuity be automatic!? It means the staff know they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting this amount, so they can just slack off. Our waiter cleared our plates once (in a buffet!) and still expected the 18% - complete rip off! Check-in staff were quite brief and pretentious. Nothing like the welcoming concierge who helped us with tours and activities to do. As a business hotel, it has a very good location, being a brisk 1 minute walk to Miami\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free tram system, while South Beach is about a $10 cab fare away, and Port of Miami is well within sight of the hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a 5-10 minute walk to Bayview Shopping Centre \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you can stand the Florida sun! We also ventured to Dolphin Mall during our stay which the hotel recommends a $10 return trip bus shuttle. Beware, however, that the Hilton is one of the last hotel stops to the mall, and when we tried to get on, it was completely full. We had to then fork out $40 each way for a taxi. All up, the stay did not exceed nor went below our expectations. If you expect a 70\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s/80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s style hotel which has new beds, then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re pretty much spot on.

Here are some observations that may be of assistance to you. LOCATION: If you are attending an event at the Miami Arena, this is a great location. It's within walking distance and the neighborhood isn't so scary that you are afraid to make the trek. There are plenty of places to grab meals within walking distance as well. ROOMS: The room was fantastic. We paid the extra $5 upon booking in the hopes to be upgraded to a bay view room when we checked in and our request was honored. The room was on the top (21st) floor with spectacular views of the bay and of downtown Miami. The bathroom had a nice granite countertop as well as the rounded shower curtain for more room. My only complaint is that the water would intermittently shut off while you were showering, which made for an interesting experience at one point when I had soap on my face! Eventually (within a minute) the water sputtered back on but it happened to my husband as well so the hotel must have a water management issue. The bed was very comfy and there was a desk w/ chair and also a nice arm chair in the corner. The TV was not a flat panel but worked just fine. May I add here that our room was very close to the elevators yet we rarely heard anything - proof of good sound insulation! FOOD/AMENITIES: The concierge was fantastic. It was my husband's birthday and the gentleman, David, helped me to arrange a delivery of strawberries and champagne to the room, which was greatly appreciated. We tried room service one day for breakfast and it did leave a bit to be desired (for the price especially). I would suggest going out for breakfast if you can swing it. The bar at the hotel is quite nice and it open until midnight. It has TVs in it so you can watch the game. There is a pool bar which our friends utilized and said the frozen drinks were amazing. My only complaint would be the steep price for parking - $28/day. I had read on here on a previous review that there was garage-style parking a block or two up but we were unable to find this and had to park at the hotel.

Once we arrived, we had to take an elevator from the \"Motor Lobby\" to the \"Lobby\" area. Check-in was easy. The person at the front desk acknowledged our request for non-down pillows, but failed to mention that the comforter was down-filled. The lobby and lounge areas are clean and nicely decorated. The rooms themselves are not bad, although upon a closer look, there were many touch-ups done or needed. We had a nice view from the 14th floor. Our room was across from the ice/soda machine so that was sometimes noisy. While the A/C is somewhat noisy when turning on and off, all in all it didn't really bother us. One thing that we did notice, and which others mentioned on this site, is the fact that the toilet paper roll is very difficult to reach from the toilet. One could easily hurt their back or even fall off the toilet while trying to reach it! The overhead shower worked, but the valve between it and the main tub faucet leaked, so a lot of water ran directly in the tub even while the overhead shower was running. The TV is rather old. Our complaint was the volume difference from channel to channel. Sometimes it was so loud, or their was a humming sound requiring us to change the channel quickly or mute the TV. We called the front desk on several occasions to ask a question or to get something for our room. When they did answer they were very pleasant and accommodating, but there were several times when the phone rang and rang with no answer. Once someone at the front desk connected us to housekeeping and we got their answering machine! One final complaint, the need to take the elevator from the room to the lobby, and then take another elevator to the motor lobby is an inconvenience. While we were there on New Year's Eve this became an outright challenge with many people coming and going. At times when the hotel was \"quiet\" it was more of a nuisance than a real issue. On the positive side, we ate once in the bar/lounge area and the food was decent. We used the wireless internet access in the lobby areas as well vs. paying 9.95 in the room.

The floor to ceiling windows provided a panoramic view of downtown Miami. Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries and Lavassa in-room coffee makers were an added touch. The TV's do, however, need to be upgraded to flat screen. We did not find the elevators to be slow as others mentioned.

Some others at my conf claimed they got 1/2 this rate from hilton website with prepay. I called ahead and asked for a quiet room - they put me in a lovely corner room that was indeed very quiet. It had only a small view as it was on the 5th floor. The problem with the room was upon checkin, the AC did not work. It was 80 and humid in Miami so this was a problem. Fortunately it turned out to be a valve that was not open in the unit and the engineer fixed it within 5 minutes. That said, there were continued AC problems throughout the hotel. The fitness center was warm. The thermostat said 77 degrees and it was in a locked clear plastic box. I called downstairs and asked them to turn it down because with the humidity it was uncomfortable and they told me that the fitness center AC was out and they had problems all week and it was still not fixed so I would have to live with it. The conf I attended was on the ballroom level and we had continual HVAC problems throughout the week. One main room in particular was fluctuating between sweltering and freezing. They could not seem to get it to maintain a reasonable temperature. Outside of HVAC issues, there are some real pluses and minuses with this hotel. My room was not really cleaned all that well - some details like the coffee mug had coffee stains on it. One end table was visibly covered in dust. Several things like that were below the level of what I expect for Hilton however there was nothing really troubling. Really it was at the level of attention to detail rather than marked problems with cleaning. Little things like they did not replenish my in room coffee one day. Another day they did not leave me a bath mat in the bathroom and only left me with one bar of soap. Regarding room service/restaurants. I ordered breakfast room service twice. The first time they made a mistake with my coffee - I ordered a pot of decaf and it came as regular. I know this only because I prodded the delivery guy that it absolutely had to be decaf. Fortunately he checked on it and found out it was not - and they phoned me in my room and said \"do not drink the coffee - it is not decaf\" and they came up with a regular pot. If I had not persisted to ask about it I would have had a nice pot of regular coffee which would have created some medical issues for me later on during the day. Another inconsistency - I ordered identical breakfasts both days. The bill was about $6 different however. The second and more expensive time the breakfast came with a large dish of berries rather than a small dish. But there is one item on the menu that I asked for so I did not understand it but I also did not care enough to follow up on this. Despite the inconsistencies the room svc breakfast was very good. In fact the regular coffee was quite good - better than the decaf, but unfortunately I could not drink the regular coffee except for a couple of sips before they phoned my room. Twice I had meals in the restaurant. One day during lunch they had a buffet. It was mediocre but also certainly a passable lunch. $15 including gratuity. The second day they did not have the buffet so I ordered a sandwich off of the menu. It was very nice. Note that for restaurant and bar even for one person they automatically add 18% gratuity, something I had not seen before in the US. They also have a very elegant bar right around the corner from the lobby. This is one of the high points of the hotel and I highly recommend the bar. You can get drinks or order food off of the bar menu. They are a little slow with the check but it is a great bar for conducting business conversations. I had several such meetings in the bar. I also got some free drinks. One night I met friends and I ordered a gingerale. I asked the guy if he wanted me to pay for it and he said no that was OK. So I gave him a small tip which made him very happy. Another day I ordered lunch with a friend and we were there for hours talking and never got a bill. Finally I left and told the front desk we never got a bill in the bar - they went and found the bill for us. I don't think this is a huge problem. At best you end up getting stuff for free and at worst you wait a little but. The front desk/concierge can help with that. Another comment - the hotel seems to be in the flight path of MIA airport. It is not a big hardship but if you are out by the pool you get some lovely views of the bottoms of jets as they pass overhead. They are pretty close. It did not bother me - I found it rather fun actually, but some may not like that. I had no problems with noise in my room from planes at night and I had two walls of floor/ceiling windows. The pool is pretty and has a small bar and beach towels. Not so many people were using the pool when I was there. It is on the lobby level. Regarding location - the hotel is not on the beach. You have to drive 10-15 minutes to get to south beach. Easy drive if you have a car, or the hotel can order a taxi. It's also a similar distance to MIA. There is not much around the hotel (other than another hotel) so if you want to go out for dinner you need to take a taxi, but as I said the places are close. Overall, I liked the hotel but had some concerns. I would certainly consider it again if I were coming to Miami but given the large number of hotels I would also look around to see what else is available. I did inquire about at least one other property this time around but they were considerably more than my conference rate.", "Date": "December 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sweden", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Linnea68", "ReviewID": "UR50782391", "Content": "Clean rooms.

Not a terrible place, but I have to say that I've stayed in nicer places that are less expensive.

First, the toilet paper holder is 2.5 ft. away from the toilet - I kid you not. You almost fall off of the toilet trying to get it. Second, my husband and I are both businesspeople, and to get wireless internet in our room, we were EACH charged $9.99 a day, even though their materials all say \"wireless internet in your room for only $9.99 a day.\" What they should say is per computer. Maybe other hotels do this, too, but I haven't experienced it. I'm sleeping in the bed with my husband. Will I be charged extra for that? Third, the entire hotel is a little run down. I'd suggest Hilton put a few dollars into a rehab. Soon. Last, the food is mediocre at best and overpriced as all hotel food is. Breakfast was cold, room service was OK. As I'm writing this review, we've been without water - the entire hotel - for more than 3 hours. Now, I don't expect Hilton to be able to control emergencies like this, but I mention it only as another point of frustration with this place.

The bell captain, Pedro Rodriguez greeted us with smiles and eager to get our bags. This was excellent, what a welcome, after that, oh well.... The arrival was rough, we had requested a junior 2-queen suite on a high floor with a 4pm checkin. We arrived around 3:40 and were advised we would need to return in about 30 minutes. No problem, since we were early and hungry. Went to eat, came back at 5:30. We were told the room was not ready yet but that it would be on the 12th floor with a great view. I would need to come back in 20 minutes. I said fine, since I wanted to make sure I would have a room with a view on a higher floor. 30 minutes later at 6:10, I am told the room was not ready yet by the front desk manager but if I did not want to wait, there was a room available on the 6th floor. No way, I would wait for the 12th floor. A very nice man who proceeded to give us 3 drinks (one for each of us) free at the bar. By then, I was not only thirsty but getting tired. I figured it was a one-nighter, might-as-well go with the flow. At 6:40, tired of waiting around and feeling happy hour, I walked straight to the front desk manager and finally got our room keys. In fact, the manager even remembered my name - I swear I was nice and gave them no negative reason. The wait, I hoped would be worth it. The bellman a really nice guy, brought our bags up and the room was cozy. The view of downtown, the rooftop pool, and the bayfront were priceless. The room is spacious, clean, and well designed. There is only one television but with the views, who needs a tv. The beds were wonderful. A negative might be that the sink, toilet and tub are all in one room, but updated and clean. We might consider this site again, but only if another is not available. It is a nice hotel but too disorganzied for our style. I would have enjoyed a swim, but without my checked in suitcase, I had to hang in the bar. The view was priceless but there are plenty of high-risers in Miami.

The water in the shower was weak, and would cut off every 20 seconds or so for about 4 seconds. The housekeeping would show up after 3pm and whiz through the room, vacuuming, making the bed, emptying the one small wastebasket in the bathroom, and not picking up any garbage I left next to it (which was in a plastic bag and tied neatly). They also did not replace the glasses, mat towel on more than one occasion and had to have them send it up to the room. On one occasion, they didn't vacuum at all...the Frito chips on the rug from the night before were still there! Internet: POOR. No free service unless you go to the lobby for wireless, only other option is a 9.95 rate for daily use of a slow throughput, sporadic connection. I called guest services and they comped me one day, transferred me to tech support which had me run a repair on my wireless connection, then ping Google, then told me there was nothing wrong on their end. Also, my laptop would pick up a wireless signal named \"Free The WiFi\" which was a third party offering connections to hotel guests for $35 for a week I believe, It was named Meraki and would offer different plans with different throughputs, the faster connections being the most expensive. When I looked them up, they would ask for a login name creation and your credit card number...YEAH Right!!! Not a whole lot of trust with that. Whoever offered this service must be aware of the fact that the Hilton charges for theirs. They have a business center in the lobby with about 8 terminals or so, which I went to use at 11pm but couldn't because a family with what seemed like there visitors (kids) were using them to watch Youtube. Valet service: $28 a day, unless you choose self parking which was $25 a day but if you take the car out you need to pay the $25 again....this in essence forced me to go with the valet. No qualms with the valet guys, they were great. The room itself was fine cosmetically, the view was great also, but the little things were what put me off. I've had better service (and free in-room internet) at the Marriott in Tarrytown, NY, and the Radisson in Harrisburg, PA...places which are far less exotic then Miami. Who knew?

They informed me that they could get me a room that wasn't bay view if I wanted to check into that one earlier. I really didn't want to do that because I had paid for a bay view room. So I waited and went and got something to eat to kill time. When I returned my room was ready about 30 minutes before 4:00.

And they sent someone up to move me and didn't make me haul my luggage all the way downstairs again. Nice touch. The pool was fine, relaxing for downtown location. I had dinner outside in the nice Miami breeze. The ceviche was terrific. But the wines by the glass selections could be a bit more varied. Kendall Jackson and BV were about it. For such an international city I thought there would be more attention paid to international wines, but that's my thing so...

This might be ok if the restaurant was busy but there were never more than 6-7 other tables. The food does come out fast once you can snag a waiter. There were still dirty tables left from the breakfast and service trays were pile high with dirty plates. Maybe just a competent bus boy would solve their issues. The conference facilities were acceptable. However, they keep the rooms like a meat locker - I would estimate that the temperature was set at 58 in some of the rooms. I wore long pants, a sweater and scarf and was still quite cold. The location of the hotel was ok. It is fairly central - close to the airport, south beach, coral gables, etc but the downtown is completely desolate.

It could have been there 10 minutes or 10 hours, who knows--a bellman had accepted delivery and never reported it to anyone. I was so happy to have the bag and reported back to the chief concierge, Yasser, what had happened so maybe someone else wouldn't have this same mix up.

I eventually received another vintage tv that favored the red colors rather than green. However, the internet problem was corrected to my satisfaction. Housekeeping varied. I had one person who did clean the room well but the majority of my stay had a person who did not even bother to wash out the coffee cups. The bartender had a habit of charging several of my group for an extra drink that was not ordered. At first I thought it was a mistake until others complained of the same problem. Minor issue, as an honors member, I hoped to receive a morning newspaper, that did not happen once during the entire stay. The hotel also charged me for valet parking daily even after I explained that I did not have a vehicle much less parking in the garage. On the plus side, the bed was comfortable and the lobby area clean.

They made me (and all runners) feel very welcome and we had a great stay. Here's a recap of our stay. Staff: The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Check in was quick and whenever I called to speak to the valet, they would identify my room and have my car brought around without my having to speak to the valet. That was a nice touch. The valet parking guys were very nice and helpful with directions and suggestions. They did \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misplace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd my car keys one time and it took about 10 minutes to find them (although the car was within sight of the valet stand, so that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the issue). But they were cool and they made it fun to come back to the hotel. Facilities: The setup is a little odd. There is a motor lobby on the ground floor and the you take an elevator to the lobby, a couple of floors up. The lobby bar and restaurant are nicely decorated and there is wi-fi available. I had dinner at the restaurant one night and it was good, with nice service. Nothing special, but a good value. I had a room on a concierge floor and it was great. The usual Hilton amenities, very clean and comfortable. The concierge lounge was great. The staff there was awesome and the breakfasts each morning were a great way to start the day. Lots of fruit, pastries, eggs, bacon, potatoes, cereal, etc. Coffee was delicious. The evening happy hour was a lot of fun too. The pool area was great; it could be a little bigger but the lounge chairs were extremely comfortable and the pool was heated, which was nice in January! Highlights: Definitely thought the service in the concierge lounge was outstanding. The pool area was relaxing and had beautiful sunsets. I liked the valet guys, too. Areas for improvement: The elevators that take you from the lobby to the motor lobby are widely spaced and the lights that indicate when an elevator arrives cannot be easily seen if you are standing to one side of the elevators, so if you hear that it is arriving and it is a couple of elevators down, you may miss it by the time you get to it. It was a common sight to see people running from one elevator to another because by the time they got to the one that \"dinged\" the doors were closing. Additionally, there was some outside maintenance being performed when we were there and although there was a floor to ceiling window (with a great view of the Cruise Ship Terminal) it was dirty. I would have really liked a Jacuzzi in the pool area; after the race it would have been great to sit in one of those! But the pool was nice. The lady in the gift shop didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get off her cell phone when she was ringing up my purchases each time I was buying something (3 times). The service from everyone else was so good that it just seemed out of place. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a Hilton employee but to me that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just not an acceptable level of service, no matter where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working. Finally, the elevators on the floor I stayed on and the floor below were very, very loud. There was a grinding squeakiness when the doors on the elevators opened on two of the cars. This woke me up several times a night, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a light sleeper. It was a real screeching noise. I called the front desk about it after the first night, but there was no improvement. Overall impression: I liked this hotel and this is the third hotel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at downtown. The Intercontinental was nice and the Doubletree had a Jacuzzi, but if I go again, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably go back to the Hilton. (I wrote reviews for those others two if you want to check them out!) Nearby transportation: The hotel is very close to the major highways, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to get to Ft. Lauderdale or the airport. The Venetian Causeway is two blocks away so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a short hop to Miami Beach. There is a Metromover station one block away so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to get around downtown Miami, like to the American Airlines arena or Bayside Marketplace.", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cOne night, pre-cruise, no complaints.\u201d", "Author": "macdadsjaw", "ReviewID": "UR25496826", "Content": "Its amazing what people find to complain about based on the numerous bad reviews of this place.

Very nice hotel, neighborhood didn't seem as bad as other reviews reported. Our rooms (both on 16th floor) were very spacious and well-appointed (except for the outdated TVs with blurry pictures). The HVAC system was very puzzling - A/C wouldn't kick on when we dropped thermostat to 62, but came on very strongly with cool air when we increased thrmst to over 75. Strange. Bed was awesome, but the pillows were feather-like and our heads disappeared and were engulfed when we laid our heads on them. View of the port was wonderful. The property - building, grounds, etc. is very, very nice. Has a very classy feel/appearance. All the staff we encountered (except the concierge, see below) was very friendly, helpful. The front desk called my cellphone when my room was ready. They, don't however, allow one to purchase an upgrade to the Concierge Level of the hotel. Strange. Even Sheraton offers that. The bathroom was nicely appointed. They could use makeup/shaving mirrors, though, since the granite vanity is fairly wide and far away from the wall mirror - makes shaving difficult for us glasses-wearers. Usually the showers in the high-rise hotels nowadays just have water trickle-out. The shower water pressure/volume here was GREAT - haven't had a hotel-shower like that in years. It was wonderful. Also, there was never a shortage of hot water. I'm puzzled by the annoyance expressed by other reviewers of the main lobby being a couple floors above the motor lobby. That is quite common in big city downtown hotels. Not a bother at all, really. The motor lobby is very well staffed and very attentive/friendly. THE POOL IS AWESOME!!! OMG - nice wide deck surrounding an unusually large/nice pool for a hotel. Water is heated, but not overly so, so there's no \"shock\" when you get in. All the chairs had rolled-up towels on them. Very, very nice. Even our shuttle driver from the port to the hotel said the pool was \"legendary\". Unfortunately, the pool bar was never opened, but there was an occasional waiter that wandered through. We did run into problems on both occasions with the (beautiful) lobby bar. Understaffed, overburdened resulting in poor service - especially considering the high prices. Plus, the English-challenged barkeeps didn't know how to make a standard Manhattan - one bartender lady had to look it up in a book or something and made it \"perfect\" rather than the standard \"sweet\" (added dry vermouth along with sweet) YUCK! Heck, even Applebees knows how to make a Manhattan! The hotel should invest in more people, trained in bar service, to cover a lobby bar of this size. It would go a long way to elevating the \"class quotient\" of the place. Especially since it's so attractively decorated and maintained. We even saw the plant-service guy going around wiping down all of the plants' leafs!! At breakfast in the lobby bar, the poor lady seemed overwhelmed by all the people, running out of $5's, running out of plates. Plus, they didn't have bagels on the continental b-fast...what's up with that? HOWEVER, there is FREE WI-FI in the lobby bar with plenty of electrical outlets on the perimeter...MUCH APPRECIATED. Didn't use the full service main restaurant. One look at the menu prices convinced us to look elsewhere ($16.50 for the standard 2 eggs/sausage breakfast?!? Yikes!!). We opted for Burger King right across the street! Also, the Concierge desk seemed to be neglected. Had to wait over 10 minutes for the guy to show up (he was delivering flowers to a room - couldn't a bellhop do that??), and then when he came back, instead of even acknowledging me, he answered the ringing phone and talked to them for another couple of minutes. Tacky for a hotel that's trying to be classy.

When I got downstairs to the motor lobby there was no one at the transportation office. The bell captain noticed I looked confused and asked me what I needed. I told him I needed a shuttle to the cruise terminal for 12 people for 11AM the next morning. He told me that no one was at the transportation office but he took my room number and told me he would have a shuttle for me at the time requested.

Get a good rate, be flexible, and you'll have a really nice stay.", "Date": "November 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cDidn't choose it but if I could, would stay some place else\u201d", "Author": "escoss", "ReviewID": "UR21945572", "Content": "Well, I'm in the hotel (checked-in last night) as I write this review, and it's perhaps the worst Hilton I've stayed so far in my life. I don't even refer to the construction noise racket going on - I was kind of somewhat mentally prepared after the reviews I had read but its the other things - a good number is small little things but very irritating and I'll try to list them in the chronological order. To begin with you should be prepared that the driving into the hotel in the makeshift lobby (motor lobby as its called in here) looks so uninviting that it reminds you of a third world hotel. I say that based on my travels - I've seen hotels under construction but they make it a point to make the construction area more lively and appealing to take focus away from construction - here, they seem to focus on the distraction itself. After you get off the car, you proceed to a small lobby with elevators - since the valet doesn't tell you that its not the main lobby so you look at the empty desk to your left, scratch your head and decide to push elevator button anyways, wherein you discover a button for the Lobby to proceed to main Lobby. The man I met at the reception area was as dry as they come in customer interactions - no smile, just questions and then I was handed the room key. He did tell me though that there will be construction noise from 8 am to 5 pm, more of that later. Elevator seems a little slower than other hotels but its only a minor irritation. My first impression coming off the elevator onto my floor was that someone has scrimped on money - its most dull carpet that I've ever seen - sure, it doesn't cause you any problem and looks and feels new but someone has gone horribly wrong with the aesthetics here. This theme continues into the room. My first impression of the room was that it was spacious but with the most dull looking furniture. The elctric outlets are curiously unavailable. There is a small coffee maker but no where to plug it in except maybe on the study desk or in bathroom. The internet router was all set except that it didn't have a power supply. The bathroom is ordinary with cheap looking wood work but with nice faucets, The house keeping may not have been very attentive when they cleaned my room - a half filled bottle of conditioner was right up on the counter - mind you, there was a filled in bottle too along with shampoo and body lotion but why leave the half filled bottle - Just to annoy the visitor. Later when I called housekeeping for some cloth hangars - the lady picked the phone and went \"Yeah\"! in a screeching voice as if I was an employee and not a guest and then as I was talking to her, without stopping me or saying hold on, just shouted\" Gregory\" - take some hangars to 12th floor and as I pondered on what my next move should be - started talking to me back again. Of course, I had nothing more to ask for except thank her for trying to help in her own style. By the way, the sound from the grinding and cutting machines is very deep and very real and you can't escape it during the day so plan to stay away in the day time - you can;t even have a decent conversation on the phone within your room while this continuous work goes on. All in all, my impressions of the hotel so far - find some other place if you can. I'm here to attend a conference being held in the hotel and that's why I had no option but if you do- stay some place else. On the plus side - The conference area is decent for this size of the hotel and I found nothing wrong with the area. The concierge in the main lobby is also helpful. The metromover train is practically next door so going to Bayside park or other areas in viccinty is easy and free. I have not checked the gym or pool yet so I'll post a review if I get a chance to visit those. By the way, I'm in room 1207 if you have stayed here and wondering what floor am I talking about", "Date": "November 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "Kimmy24", "ReviewID": "UR21940489", "Content": "I stayed here for a 4 day conference.

From the beginning, we ate in the buffet and were misinformed of the price, then charged an 18% gratuity, when it took my \"waitress\" 15 minutes to bring me a cup of coffee...which was her ONLY trip to my table. The food was ridiculous and we found ants on the muffins, which was disgusting, but forgiveable, at this point. We then went to the front desk to check in and asked for suggestions for pizza delivery because we weren't from around there. The front desk agent simply replied, \"Oh, there's Dominoes and stuff\", and that was the end of it. We checked in to our room and settled in. At about 11pm, a man, who I am assuming was a maintenance man, attempted to ENTER OUR ROOM. Luckily, we had the latch on, but he actually put in the key, unlocked it, and tried to come in, without so much as a knock. As I wake from my sleep and go in to the bathroom, I notice DRIED BLOOD on the toilet. I had had it with the place at that point. Be assured, I have already contacted the Miami Health Services Department with that one. Moving on: the air conditioner in our room was clearly malfunctioning, it went on and off every 15 minutes with an EXTREMELY loud screeching and grinding noise, probably why the man tried to enter our room. To top it all off, when I took a shower the next morning, there was ABSOLUTELY NO HOT WATER. I'm not an idiot, I know how to work a faucet, there was simply no hot water. I will never stay at a Hilton again. I have been a longtime Starwood member and rightly so. We made a reservation last-minute or I would have never stayed there in the first place, but believe me, I have learned my lesson!

My opinion is that this motel was extremely unorganized during this time. Upon arrival at the motel my party was told that we couldn't be checked into a room despite paying our trip in advance because they were having issues receiving payment from the vendor. We had our payment receipts and confirmations in hand and had also called in advance to confirm before arriving. We have to stand around for about two hours before being checked in. Upon checking in the room they assigned us was the wrong type. We had to go back downstairs to be assigned another room. When were assigned a new room the keys didn't work so we had to go back to have them activated. The room we finally received was very nice. We stayed in 724 which was a one bedroom suite. It was very spacious and well kept. On the upside the manager bought us dinner and drinks at the restaurant for our inconvenience at check-in and he was very apologetic and nice. The food at the restaurant was excellent and the service was great. For the most part the staff was very professional and on top of their job. There was a male bartender that in my opinion was very rude, unprofessional and obviously doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like his job, but that was my only negative encounter. We didn't rent a car upon arrival, but met a really nice cab driver who took us everywhere we wanted to go for the whole time we were there. This was an expensive option, but it was convenient since neither of us in the party was familiar with Miami. One of the downsides to this motel is the location. There is no food or entertainment around. There is a Checkers and a Burger king across the street.

The room was very spacious and nicely put together. HOUSEKEEPING: Never understood that there were 4 people in the room (room can hold 5) and choose to only put towels for 3 each day we were day (4 days) despite many calls to the front desk. They also did an extremely lousy job in cleaning the room. They would leave dirty glasses and leave new ones and they did not change the sheets. VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet drivers\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window.

We used the rooftop pool which was great even in the rain! It is nice and large and deep and the patio has a very nice view. I would suggest going accross the street to eat, the restaurants in the hotel are quite pricey but at the Doubletree across the street they have a bit of a mall with a few different alternatives. We ate burgers and fries at the deli there and really enjoyed it. I booked on Priceline and spent $65 and felt that we got a steal, I would have paid twice that. Anyone having a bad experience at this hotel is either too picky, or maybe was there at too busy of a time. We have quite high standards and the Hilton met them quite nicely. My only negative comment is that it was very hard to get anyone from guest services on the phone from the room, but when I went down to the desk they were readily available.

We were not told that it was a net direct rate and it was non refundable or non exchangeagble and we came during hurricane season. The staff upon arrival - a young lady was assisting us with our check in. Had no rooms available that fit our request that was booked and paid in full so she got frustrated and walked away.

The bar hours of operation could be better - if you are on vacation 4pm until 10pm are very limited and forces you to have to go elsewhere to patronize other restaurants and services.
