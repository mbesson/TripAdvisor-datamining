We were in town for a conference I was presenting at, and we decided that we'd stay for the week and enjoy the town. After searching tripadvisor for the best possible hotel that would be close to the conference center, close to transportation, not a dump, and wouldn't break my budget. Man, did the Baldwin DELIVER!! We arrived and checked into our room 802 no problem. Our room was clean, great updated bathroom, flat panel tv, and a very comfortable queen sized bed. Our room faced the main street outside. There's no central air/AC, but the weather was cool and within seconds of opening the windows, plus the ceiling fan, our room was always cool. Everyday except for 1, we were out on the town all day, and returned in the evening. This is a great place to stay if you're going to be wondering around San Fran! The money we saved on hotel, we were able to budget and see everything! Wine Country, Alcatraz, The Mission, Fishermans Warf, China town! Being located right in Union Square, you are steps away from all the shopping, and public transportation. We took the Bart to and from the Airport, we took the buses to the mission, and we took the trollies to the warf. You can't beat that! We didn't have any problems with noise, though I could see how people would be bothered by trucks at night. One of the nights when they picked up the trash you could hear it pretty well, but we just closed the window a little and that was that. It's not a Four Seasons, or Hilton, so don't expect all the glitz and glammour. Do expect to recieve all the essentials, a comfortable room, great location, great staff, and a great way to sleep on a budget. Next time I go to San Fran I will 100% staying back.I have nothing negative to say.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poconos", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "mountains94", "ReviewID": "UR127041214", "Content": "I did research and was not disappointed by this hotel.

We were very happy with the entire stay. The hotel is small and very old, but has a lot of character and is newly renovated. We stayed in Room 904 on the 9th floor on the advice of other reviewers. We requested a room that was not in the front of the hotel or near the elevator. We didn't have a view, since we were on the side of the building, but we didn't mind it. It was quiet. The room was spotlessly clean and everything in our room was new. It had a flat screen tv and we had a regular tub in our bathroom, not a claw foot tub. The room was a little small with the 2 beds, but the closet was spacious and so was the bathroom. We had plenty of room for the 2 of us. There was a safe in the closet, hair dryer, iron/ironing board - all the usual amentities, except coffee. You need to go to the lobby for coffee or tea, but that was ok for us. The ice and vending machines are also in the lobby. The radiator is loud and makes strange squealing noises. We called it the pig :-) The pig woke up the first night when the heat was turned on and we called downstairs to have them turn it off. A man came up immediately and shut off the valve. It squealed some more during the first night, but we didn't hear anything for the next 2 nights since it was shut off. Yes, the pipes also squeal when you shower, but that didn't bother us. We normally travel with ear plugs due to snoring, so we really weren't bothered by noises and slept really well. The staff at the Baldwin was impressive! Very nice, very friendly and so helpful in telling us about the city, how to get to certain places by public transportation and good restaurants to eat in. The towel animals on the bed each day was a plus! The location of the hotel was incredible! You walk out the front door and to the left are the gates to Chinatown. There were so many restaurants and shops. We took 2 trips into Chinatown. To the right are high-end clothing stores like Armani, Betsy Johnson, Coach, etc. and the hotel is only a few blocks to the buses and cable cars.

There were renovations going on in the reception area during my stay, but for the small amount of time I was actually in the hotel, this was of no inconvenience or hindrance to myself. The staff were very friendly, very helpful and keen to assist in any questions about public transport, restaurants, bars etc. Hotel is ideally placed for shopping. Perfect for a bag drop before returning to the shops. Hotel is also ideally placed for public transport. The BART and MUNI system runs from just a couple of blocks away, likewise the Cable Cars, Street Cars and bus system. If you are fit, then anywhere is walkable. If you are expecting all mod cons, breakfast, dinner, flashy rooms, AC, multi channel satellite TV on flat screen HD TV then book somewhere else. If you are looking for a step back in time and somewhere to just crash for a night or a few nights, and to eat out daily then go for it. Free Wifi was a great bonus, allowing me to check in with home on a nightly basis and keep up to date with everything. I was over for a 49ers and Sharks games and it was ideal for me. Great location, close to public transport, close to bars, restaurants and shops. The Friday and Saturday nights were quite loud outside and the hotel and coffee bar opposite seemingly work through the night, so there was some noise from that as well as the bin men who turn up very early in the morning.

The price was the biggest draw for us and although the room was very basic, it had everything we needed including a very nice bathroom and comfortable bed. The maids also do the cutest towel animals each day. Our biggest complaint and reason I did not give this hotel 5 stars is the street noise. I was SO excited to get a nice city view when we first entered the room and we slept very well both Friday and Saturday nights. Sunday night however, we were awoken TWICE by banging, screeching, beeping garbage trucks going down a nearby alley. Two different sets cleaned the dumpsters that night and this took 1 hour each time they came....(no idea why two separate trucks came and did the same thing). So after that evening we figured the dumpsters were empty and we wouldn't have to deal with it again since they didn't come on Friday or Saturday so we didn't ask to change rooms. But we were wrong. They came again and did the same thing our remaining two nights.

Yes the previous reviews were right \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is a noisy place being right in the middle of Union Square and steps from the Chinatown Gate. Since it is a 100 year old Californian building the windows and only single pane glass and do not block out much sound.

I think the rooms at the back of the hotel are quieter. The room was an adequate size, but really we do not spend a lot of time in the rooms when we travel.

A good idea to bring your own mug too since all they have is Styrofoam cups. The WiFi was a horrid price at $9 a day. I just wandered down to the green and white Seattle based Coffee monopoly and bought some tea and used their internet each evening (being cheap, and inventive I saved the mug for the morning coffee . . . hate Styrofoam!)

Generally speaking we're the kind of travelers who use our hotel rooms for the bare necessities - sleeping and showering - so no frills rooms don't bother us so long is the price is good. We were really impressed with the Baldwin Hotel and would happily stay there again on future trips to San Francisco. It's really convenient to get to from the airport via public transportation as there is a BART station about four blocks away, and for the duration of our trip we were really happy to find that it was a quick walk to various bus and cable car lines that could whisk us away to other parts of the city. It was also just about 10 steps from the gate leading into China Town which was absolute heaven for us in terms of food options, and we were just 2 blocks north of Union Square which was great for doing some Black Friday shopping! Our room was definitely on the small side and luxuries were limited, but it was cozy and comfortable and we got good sleep even though the walls were quite thin (so we could on occasion hear our neighbors). I was disappointed that the television reception was pretty bad so that watching tv in the evenings was out (and only about 12 channels were available anyway), but that certainly wasn't a dealbreaker. Also, I always appreciate when Wifi or internet is available free somewhere in the hotel where I'm staying, but all internet was cost-based here. Thankfully there are a plethora of coffeeshops (and a Border) nearby where free Wifi was available so while that wasn't the most convenient alternative it was still something. The Baldwin Hotel certainly isn't the lap of luxury, but if you're looking for a frugal but comfortable place to stay while visiting San Francisco, it's a great choice. We really appreciated how the cleaning staff created sculptures out of our fresh towels each day (one day they made a crab, one day two kissing swans, etc.,) as it made our stay feel just a little more friendly and fun (and always made us laugh). Given the location, this hotel is a steal, and is a great choice if you want a prime home base while in town.", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location!\u201d", "Author": "AbdulHalim", "ReviewID": "UR89572254", "Content": "Though the room size is rather small for 3 adults we have an enjoyable stay, will defnitely stay here again when visiting SF", "Date": "December 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverside, ca", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful hotel less than 1 block from Chinatown.\u201d", "Author": "MrBurritoMan", "ReviewID": "UR89163550", "Content": "A very charming well staffed hotel right at the foot of Chinatown.

I was apprehensive about staying there since the rate (booked early and they had a promotion) was so reasonable and the other reviews mentioned things like the noise, musty hall ways, little rooms and old fashioned bath tub/shower. Yes, the hall did smell musty, but the room did not. I bought a rubber type bathmat (at the Dollar Store before we went) so that helped as far as it being slippery and difficult to get in the shower.

We picked the Baldwin Hotel for its location, good price and positive reviews. The hotel was perfect for us - great location, good sized room with a big closet, surprisingly quiet. It has less of a hotel feeling and more of feeling like a house (the doors have actual keys rather than cards!) and I really don't have any complaints at all about the hotel itself. But, we did have a disappointing experience with customer service that tainted our stay. We were in Vancouver before heading to SF, and the night before our flight my husband got a terrible case of food poisoning from our dinner. He was so sick there was no way we could travel the next day and we had to change our flight to the following day. So, instead of spending the 4 nights we at the Baldwin we had planned, we missed the first night and were there for 3 nights. I called them right away to let them know we would be a day late. It is their policy to charge you for the night unless you have a doctor's note as proof of illness -- which we of course didn't, since we were in Canada and my husband didn't need a doctor, he just needed to get through it and rest for a day. We explained the situation to them multiple times and they just wouldn't budge. Now of course I understand this is their policy, but it's always disappointing when a place of business won't be flexible in extreme circumstances -- it wasn't like we never showed up for our reservation, we got there as soon as we could and still stayed for 3 nights. And the night that we missed was a Monday night -- surely not a busy night where they would have lost money by not renting the room to someone else. It was just frustrating - it was hard to lose a day of our vacation and lose the extra money from having to pay for double hotel rooms that night on top of it. I find that most places of business in that kind of situation will be more understanding. After talking to several people, they finally offered us a complimentary night's stay through the end of this year, but wouldn't let us apply it to the night we missed - and we obviously aren't going back to SF this year, so it wasn't really worth anything. Oh well - it really is a good hotel for price and location and I liked the room - just not so much for above and beyond customer service.

I have never written an online review before but really wanted others to know about this place. Budget and safety were top concerns for me when booking this trip -- I am a female graduate student, as is the friend I traveled with. I did thorough research on hotels in San Francisco and this was BY FAR the best price I came across, especially for this location (I honestly don't understand how they manage to keep their costs so low in such an expensive city; when we were there I passed by a hotel that I had previously seen online but decided not to go with because it was three times the price, it was located just down the block from the Baldwin but looked very much run down, while the Baldwin was very well maintained). We were a short walk from museums, shopping, restaurants and bars and felt comfortable taking the bus back from Haight later at night after going out over there (plenty of public transportation stops are on Market Street, just a few blocks away). The room was no frills but rather spacious, and VERY clean and quiet. The staff was WONDERFUL, always providing directions and recommendations on places to eat. They also had a $15 shuttle to the airport, which was definitely much cheaper than a cab. The only downside was that there wasn't a fridge in the room, and they didn't provide free internet, though there is a Starbucks just up the block with WiFi service. If you're looking for a super luxury hotel, this isn't the place for you. But if you're looking for a nice, spotless room at an incredibly reasonable rate in the heart of the city, you should definitely book this. This hotel is truly a steal, and I will definitely recommend it to friends and return there for my next trip to San Francisco.", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cSolid all-around, great location\u201d", "Author": "dtandrews", "ReviewID": "UR75511832", "Content": "Great price, room was clean, staff was very attentive, had no issues.

With all that there is to do in San Francisco, who wants to spend a whole lot of time in their room anyway? We just wanted a place that was clean, safe, and had a helpful staff.

We had a room on the 5th floor facing the street and slept with the window open every night and didn't really think it was all the noisy. No bar or restaurant in the actual hotel itself, but you have a Starbucks and Sushi place right next door and a French restaurant and a wine and coffee bar directly across the street. Wireless internet goes for about $9 per day, $18 for 3 days and somewhere around $35 for a month. Still cheaper to pay for the internet here than pay up to $100 more a night just to stay at the higher end hotels in the same area. Public trans, trolly and subway were also very close to this location. AT&T Park is only around 1.5 miles away so I didn't see the need to flag a cab to get there...I walked it just fine. Bottom line, The Baldwin Hotel isn't a five star hotel and doesn't claim to be. It was still a nice hotel centrally located to China Town, Union Square (where the shopping is) and the Financial district. Beds could be a little more comfortable, but they weren't bad.

It is next to the gate of chinatown, but the actual chinatown area is still a few blocks north, hence the area is quite peaceful and safe. We took advantage of the stay 3 nights and get a free tour for 2 package (very good deal). We were given a free tour operated by a 3rd party tour company that took us on a 3 hour ride to all the main locations around SF. We stayed in a queen room (1 queen bed only) which was quite small, but the room and bathroom was clean and tidy (nothing special though). It was a surprise to have a LCD TV in the room but it buzzed on certain channels. The heating system (no A/C, just a fan in the ceiling for summers) also made funny sound from time to time during the night which was slightly unpleasant (but this is probably room specific). Overall I recommend this hotel for the budget conscience but still wanting a private and comfortable stay. The location is top notch with an easy bus ride on 8A bus to fisherman's wharf. If you are staying for 3 days or so make sure you get the $18 unlimited metro travel for 3 days. This is available at the visitor centre opposite Macy's. This allows you to travel unlimited on bus/muni/tram (which is otherwise $5), although we found the tram more of a novelty than a viable transport solution. This pass doesn't cover Bart though. Note if you are flying into SFO or oakland (all SF airports are linked by Bart) and staying at baldwin, just take the Bart straight from the airport stop to Montgomery stop. Very easy and fast.

The bathroom was a good size and included a tub as well as a shower (ie the shower was in the tub). The location was excellent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just a few steps from China Town. It was really easy to get around and we felt safe in the area. After reading other comments on this site, we specifically requested a room away from the lift shaft and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any problems with noise. Wi-fi is available but there is a daily charge for this so we found it better value to go to a local cafe with free wi-fi instead. No breakfast was provided but coffee was available in the lobby throughout the day. There are lots of cafes etc nearby so finding somewhere for breakfast wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d definitely recommend this as a clean, comfortable and good value base for exploring San Francisco.", "Date": "April 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hickory, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cYou Get What You Pay For\u201d", "Author": "mzed12007", "ReviewID": "UR28559970", "Content": "I will preface this review by saying that I was looking for the most inexpensive way to stay in a major American city- San Francisco. In this one particular case, after having may successful trips with the advise of Trip Advisor, I was let down by the reviews on The Baldwin Hotel in San Francisco. Suffice it to say, this experience was mostly my own fault in the making. I have learned that indeed, you \"get what you pay for\"- especially in a large city such as San Fran. Positives: The Baldwin was one of the most inexpensive locales that I found in San Fran. The staff was very friendly and tried to be as accomodating as possible. The rooms were clean- if a bit spare. Negatives: Probably one of the worst nights I have spent in a hotel. The room was located on the 7th floor accessable by a small elevator (which had been mentioned in a previous review). I arrived in San Francisco in the middle of a \"heat wave\" (which is rare from what the locals tell me) with temps in the 90's. 1) The room had no air conditioning and has only a small water-radiator for heat- which was NOT needed!! The only relief was to open a window (without insect screens) and an overhead fan. As mentioned previously, the room was small. No rooms with King/Queen beds were available, so had two twin beds. 2) The advertised Wifi available is through a company located in -- Oregon-- the Wifi was sporadic at best, with the signal being lost constantly- also a charge of appox. $20 for three days use. 3) Water pressure in the shower/tube was dribbling (very weak) with little hot water available at around 7:30 AM. 3) The noise was the most agonizing factor of my entire one night's stay. My room, on the 7th floor, was located on the side of the building facing an alley-way- the only view was of the building next door (again mentioned in a previous review of this property). All During the night, traffic noise was terrible with the \"back-up beeping\" of serivce vehicles throughout the night- at one point, when trying to go to sleep apox. 10:30 PM there was about 10 minutes of glass breaking and beeping and the noise of a dumpster truck dumping several containers in the alley- imagine listening to this through an open window. I stayed for one night- I had made the reservations pre-paid through one of the major travel internet sites and, after talking with two hotel clerks and two representatives of this major travel site, I was refused even a partial refund for my booked 4 nights stay- the major travel site did give a $50 certificate for future use as an attempt for an apology. So, the moral of this story is: if you are trying to do your travel \"on the cheap\"- beware- even with good to moderate reviews on Trip Advisor- one paradise is another person's misery.", "Date": "April 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spain", "Title": "\u201cloved it\u201d", "Author": "Flamencospain", "ReviewID": "UR26184727", "Content": "We came to the hotel late in the evening on a saturday night.

I had done a lot of research for our entire USA trip and found that this hotel had the best reviews and was best value for money. We arrived quite late (as our flight from Australia arrived around 9pm), we didnt make it into the city until around 1030ish, but we were met with a warm and thankfully very swift reception. The hotel has a very cosy feel to it, more of a boutique feel, than a hotel (which i preferred). There were rows of SF information in the lobby and also hot coffee and tea available all night. Our room was on the 2nd level (the elevator was not a modern or fast one) which turned out to be great in our case as we could easily walk up and down the stairs to our room!! The room was comfy with a large closet area, safe, tv, nice big comfy bed and a bathroom that was clean and practical (there was hardly any water pressure in the shower), but apart from that it was in a good location, near china town, near public transport, walking distance to the city centre (from memory around 10-15minutes) and secure (they would lock the door after a certain time at night and you need a key to get inside the hotel). they also helped arrange transfers to SFO when we departed. the whole hotel and room were instantly welcoming and i felt right at home as soon as i walked in the door. i would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a great deal in a cosy little boutique hotel. would suggest a lower level floor (to try and avoid using lifts), and would recommend requesting a room not directly facing the main road the hotel is located on. It can get a little noisy during the day, alot of foot traffic (although arriving into USA for the first time, i enjoyed watching people from my window and listening to the new noises).", "Date": "March 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, ok Room\u201d", "Author": "dc_jpd", "ReviewID": "UR25481884", "Content": "I stay in SF on a regular basis and always try to stay at the Baldwin when possible.

For its price of $82+/night, it was not a bad choice - room was basic but adequate. The hotel staff is always friendly and happy to help. A couple of things to watch out for : 1. We were not very happy about having to pay for internet connection, even if you use the hotel's PC in the lobby ( at $5 for 20 minutes ). One would need to pay for internet connection in the room as well - not sure how much the internet card is, though. 2. If you do choose to stay in this hotel, please get a room away from the lift because, as mentioned in an earlier review, you can hear the noisy lift shaft from your room every time it's being used. Having said that, the location is great - less than 5 minutes walk to Union Square, lots of cafes in the area and Loehmann's ( designer clothing/accessory bargain store ) just around the corner. You can catch the cable car about 1.5 blocks away - a mere 3 minute stroll from the hotel. There is no breakfast served in the hotel but there is coffee and tea in the lobby every morning. That should not deter anyone as you can get a nice breakfast in any of the cafes nearby. Although this hotel is right in front of the Chinatown gate, one would still have to walk a few blocks to get Chinese food as the stores right after the Gate sells mostly antiques and oriental souvenirs. The restaurant/bar called E&O Trading Company on Sutter Street ( just around the corner from the hotel ) is really worth trying - great Southeast Asian food in a lovely environment.

The Baldwin is more than central, right at the gates of China Town and just a few blocks from Union Square. We originally booked a double room and then decided to upgrade to a queen. However, when we were shown the room the bed looked awfully small, like a 3/4 size, but when we checked with reception we were assured that it was in fact a queen size room. (I think this may be a language barrier between Americans and Brits so do check before booking, I think perhaps the double could have been a twin!!) Anyway, the room was in no way a problem. The bed was small, but cosy (boyfriend is 6ft 4); the room and bathroom were cleaned every day (left a 2 dollar tip every day). The sheets were clean and towels were fluffy and plentiful. The bathroom was lovely with a traditional cast iron bath with plenty of hot water and an EXCELLENT shower (I have a thing about hotel showers!!) all in all we were very happy and comfortable. On the down side (there isn't much), the decor is a little dated, but you're not in San Francisco to see hotel decor. There are NO tea/coffee making facilities in the room, so bring a travel kettle and supplies. The hotel advertises tea/coffee facilities in the lobby, however every time my boyfriend went for a coffee, there wasn't any, or worse it was always cold. Did not see any tea for the entire stay. The only other negative thing was the lack of air conditioning. Now coming from good old UK, we don't know the modern phenomenon of air conditioning, but I imagine that this could be a problem for some people. We were at the Baldwin in the last week of October 2007 and there was a bit of a heat wave. Temperatures were between 79 to 84F (26-28C) degrees everyday. We had the window open by day, but it gets very noisy outside due to the hotel's central location. It wasn't a problem for us, but I wouldn't advise staying here at the height of summer unless the hotel gets some air con. The staff greeted us very warmly and remained this way for the rest of the week, directing us to the post office, advising on trips, ordering cabs etc Our stay was room only so we had to forage for food everyday, but you will never go hungry or bored of food in San Francisco. We had sushi, Chinese, Italian, fish and so on and so on. Here are some of my favourite places to eat. 1. Cheesecake Factory top floor of Macy's. Very popular and touristy but well worth it. 2. North Beach Restaurant in Little Italy. So delicious, the best pasta outside of Rome. Quite expensive, but worth a treat. Brilliant traditional fine dining 3. Capps Corner. Americanised version of Italian cuisine. Generous portions, cheap and very very cheerful. 4. Mayflower Market. This is a little deli/mini-market on Bush street between Stockton Street and Grant Avenue (around the corner from the hotel) You can get all sorts here, fruit, bagels, sandwiches, crisps etc All to help you have that cheap breakfast/lunch. San Francisco is the most amazing city and there is so much to see and do. Highlights of the week were the visit to Alcatraz (pre-book online before you go) Golden Gate Bridge, Japanese Tea Gardens, San Francisco Zoo, Haight-Ashbury District, Pier 39, and Muir Woods. Although you'll find the most amazing and interesting things around every corner. If you haven't worked it out by now, I simply LOVE San Francisco and sincerely hope that I will go back one day. I hope that you will love it just as much as me!!

On the plus side, the location was very convenient, it was right outside Chinatown and was an easy walk to SFMOMA, the Ferry Building, and bus stops. The room and bathroom were clean and okay, although I asked for an extra pillow because the one pillow I got was flat and hard. Having just a ceiling fan and no A/C, it got too hot in our room. What really didn't help is that the ancient radiator in the room, while technically turned off, was still running a little bit of hot water. The front desk guy came up to look at it but really couldn't do anything about it. Our room faced the street, so there was definitely noise to deal with, but that would have been okay. What wasn't okay was the constant banging sound (something in the building rattling, maybe the elevator shaft) that was so loud I could hear it through earplugs. Couldn't sleep through that. On our 2nd day there, even though we left the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on our door, our room was cleaned anyway. This was just a little annoying because the whole reason we put the sign out is because we don't need new towels every day or to have our room cleaned when we've barely been in it. On our 3rd morning there, we had no water pressure in our shower. Another time our room got cleaned and the bar of soap we had only used for 2 days was thrown away and replaced with a new one, wrapped in plastic.

We booked through an online service, pre-paid and took BART from San Francisco Airport, with a subway stop three blocks from the Baldwin. Check-in was quick and easy. Our room was on the 10th floor, with a queen-size bed and private bath. The room was small but very clean and the maid service every day was thorough. There were only two pillows on the bed but when we asked for two more they happily complied. I have read some complaints about the front desk but that was not our experience at all; they were always very friendly and helpful. The first night we stayed there it was hot but a ceiling fan kept it pretty comfortable. After that the temp. dropped and it was very comfortable. The elevator is slow but not so much as to be a problem. The location is excellent, right down the block from Chinatown; just beyond Chinatown is North Beach (a little Italy) and a bit farther Coit Tower (with another slow elevator that is worth the $5 charge to the top, where there are spectacular views). Union Square is also near, as is the cable car terminus down to Fisherman's Wharf. Trips to Alacatraz leave from Pier 33 but make a reservation - those trips fill up fast in the summer. The cable car trip is fun but there are long waits at the turn-arounds. We also took BART to the F line trolley to Fisherman's Wharf, which also worked well. There's also a Starbucks just up the block from the Baldwin. Checkout is at 11 a.m. and our plane did not leave until 5 p.m. However, they let us leave our bags at the front desk and we wandered around Chinatown for a few more hours. One depressing note: there are a lot of homeless in the general area, though we did not see any congregating at the Baldwin. Some are pretty aggressive demanding money though overall it is more than anything else a very sad testiment to our society's inability to make these folks' lives better than sleeping on the streets and begging.", "Date": "June 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cBasic Hotel but Great Location\u201d", "Author": "travelingrules", "ReviewID": "UR17109614", "Content": "The Baldwin should really get a \"3\" rating, however the location and comparisons to other SF hotels for the price gives it the extra edge. Make no mistake, this is an old-style, bare bones hotel with no extra amenities. No AC, a creaky, slow old elevator, and very sloooow front desk sevice. However management has made the best of what it has, and the room I had smelled of fresh paint and the bathroom was newly redone, with immaculately white grout, new tiles and fixtures, and an effort to give a sense of a nice stay with decent toiletries. There is no AC, but a large ceiling fan that did its job on a spring evening. The front desk is usually manned by one, maybe two people who do not like to multi-task. Many Europeans seem to stay here, and the language barrier, as well as the ridiculous amount of paperwork upon check-in, as well as an antiquated computer system and the use of old fashioned metal keys leads to a lengthy wait should you be in line. Check in and check out take over 15 minutes-- There is decent free coffee in the lobby 24 hours a day, which is a nice touch. The beds have a lot to be desired, and the pillows are synthetic and flat. Only two pillows on a queen bed instead of four, and a cheap, thin cover with no extra blanket in the closet. On the plus side, there is a large safe in the closet to hold laptops and large personal items, and when you leave your room you can use the deadbolt lock in addition to the handle lock. Also, the hotel locks the front door between the hours of 10pm and 6am to keep non-guests out, and guests can enter with a key. The front desk always had someone there at late and early hours, for added security. The location cannot be beat. Turn in any direction from the front door and Union Square is all around you with its many restaurants and shops. The gate to Chinatown is right there as well. Close to the financial district too. There are many boutique hotels in SF, and you never quite know what you are getting yourself into, especially in the lower price ranges. With the Baldwin, it pretty much meets average expectations, with no negative surprises, and even a few positive ones, like how clean it is, good security, and the overall feeling that at least an effort is being made to make the best of what they have. The neighborhood is great and vibrant, and again, with Union Square, some of it can turn shady fast. Not so with this location. In all, I would stay here again if my more favored (luxury) hotels are seasonally priced out of my range.

The loudest it got was when some folks came stumbling back from a party, and I didn't hear them anymore once they actually went into their own room. Only downside is that the in-room copy of the free tourist magazine had a page ripped out by a previous occupant. I put it in the trash. The maid put it back on the desk, so I just ripped it in half and put it back into the trash. These magazines are free, so it's not as though they need to reuse them until all the pages are ripped from them. :)", "Date": "September 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent choice\u201d", "Author": "Tuggster", "ReviewID": "UR8605891", "Content": "The prime plus point for this hotel is the location, right by the gate to China Town.

My Husband and I were so pleased. We walked from the BART station (3 blocks). The staff was very nice and helpful. The maid service was good and location is great! The hotel is literally steps from China town, and 1 block from Union Square. The hotel is old, but the rooms did not smell, and it is a non-smoking, no pets hotel which is nice. They have done well to update it. The window open and the ceiling fan kept us plenty cool, and the new bed was very comfortable.

Although check-in was not until the mid-afternoon, they were able to get us into our room at 9am. Our room was fabulous. It overlooked Grant St. and was immaculately clean. Not large, but not ridiculously small either. The bathroom was nice with good water pressure. The Baldwin's location is absolutely perfect to seeing San Francisco, and in a very safe area.
