We were all adults and at a point were we usually stay at higher-end hotels, so I honestly thought that the place was pretty average. Everything was there that was promised, the breakfast room had lots of hot and cold items for everyone, they had a pool, good location for theme parks. The breakfast I think would be especially appealing to families because it's an all you can eat buffet, so picky kids will find something. One down side was that the \"business center\" was one computer just off the lobby. It was the only place with a printer, but they didn't have the latest version of flash installed, so I couldn't print my boarding passes for my return flight. I was able to use the computer behind the front desk, but still - get a tech guy, you know?

This worked even better for our group of 7. We checked in on a Thursday and found another nice surprise, a Manager's special hospitality evening with free hot dogs, hamburgers, potato chips, salad, and beverages. Then each of our 4 mornings the Inn provided a sumptuous breakfast buffet with an amazing variety. The suite was clean and very comfortable, the A/C worked well and quietly, the wi-fi and TVs were fine in our room, the front desk was very helpful including a wake-up call right on time our last morning, and our grandkids enjoyed the pool.. However, we were disappointed to learn before we came of the limited shuttle service to Disney World, so we felt we needed a rental car for conveniently getting there. We requested no service in our suite for the 4 days and were happy to be left alone. Now for the minor problems which I wouldn't have expected at an expensive Marriott hotel. The clock was missing some numbers. The toilet seat wouldn't stay up when I was urinating without my holding it. The frig was quite noisy. The sheets in the closet were king size for the double-sized sofabed. The kitchen supplies were quite skimpy for 7 people--4 plates, 4mugs, 3 small bowls, 2 glasses, 3 spoons, no serving spoons, no detergent for the sink or dishwasher.

Being a Marriott Platinum member, I did score an end-unit on the 5th floor, right next to the stairwell. My king-bed room was the more updated \"L-shaped\" unit with sitting area, kitchen and sleeping area. My room was also a handicapped room, so I believe it had more space. The room was extremely clean, quiet, and beds were very comfortable. The flat panel TV was quite large, perhaps 46\". It swivelled between the sitting area and bed. The bed was extremely comfortable with a nice variety of pillows (of various firmness). The hallway had an odd (but not bad) smell which reminded me of an older hotel. I typically do not use the pool area, however, it was quite a nice size, and well-laid out. There is also a small poolside bar as well. The fitness room had two treadmills, two eliptical machines and one exercise bicycle. All were in working order. While small, the exercise room also had a large variety of free weights and two main televisions. Check-in was fast and efficient. The lobby area is a bit small. There is a separate breakfast area which is closed off from the lobby. I did not try the breakfast nor the manager's happy hour (Tuesday through Thursday from 6:00PM - 7:30PM) I read many reviews about slow wireless internet service, however, I did not experience any slow-internet issues. This could be because the location of my room is fairly close to the lobby. If wireless internet is important to you, you should probably inquire when you check in -- perhaps some of the rooms have a stronger signal than others. The hotel is not within walking distance of any restaurants nor shops, so a car is necessary. For tourists, I would say the location is ideal as it is equal distance between Disney and SeaWorld. For business travellers, it is very close to I-4, Beachline Expressway, and Central Florida Parkway. For me, the important features of quietness, cleanliness and room apperance are the most important. For these reasons, I am rating the property as excellent.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville KY", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to visit\u201d", "Author": "george b", "ReviewID": "UR128016585", "Content": "I have never written a review before this one.

We chose this hotel because we have stayed at Residence Inns before and of all the Residence Inns in Orlando this was the best value in the area we wished to stay. I am so glad we chose this hotel. As a frequent traveller both for business and pleasure, I have had the opportunity to stay in many hotels and must say I was impressed by the service at this property. It is extremely well run. You can tell they have hired the right people for the right jobs as everyone seems happy to work there and it is a true team environment. The General Manager is not scared to get his hands dirty as he was even in the breakfast room on more than one occassion helping to clear dishes. All this translates into happy staff and excellent customer service. Here are a few helpful details: Breakfast - the breakfast runs 6:30-9:30 M-F and 7-10 on the weekends. The hotel was sold out during our stay and we never had a problem finding a seat. We also got to see the breakfast food rotation. I can honestly say I ate off this buffet for 14 days and didn't get tired of it. They have muffins, toast, bagels, juice, fruit, yogurt, 3 waffle makers (with all the toppings), cereals, scrambled eggs and sausage rounds daily. The rotational food items consisted of croissants, biscuits, bacon, hasbrown potatoes, pancakes and french toast. Manager's Reception - Tuesday-Thursday nights from 6pm-7:30pm. They post a schedule of the \"theme\" in the room. It rotates from italian night, mexican night, sausage and pulled pork night, hamburgers and hotdogs and \"comfort food night\", which is meatloaf and mashed potatoes or mac and cheese. It is great for a light dinner and select beer and wines are complimentary. Room - we stayed on the 5th floor in room 516 which was fairly close to the central elevator and lobby elevator. This room was on the hghway side and I can honestly say the noise didn't both me. The rooms are very well insulated from noise...we couldn't even hear the neighbours. The room was well appointed and had 2 tv's and free wifi. Even a dishwasher and garburator. I loved that the fridge had a built in ice maker so no need to walk the hallways with a bucket! The beds were very comfortable with 5 pillows per bed! The shower water pressure was also amazing (I missed this when I got home). There is a laundry room on each floor and rates are $1.50 per wash/dry (quarters available at the front desk). If you have a full load it is required that you put the dryer on twice. Pool - the pool is open 8am-10pm daily and the bar opens at 2pm. There are always daily drink specials which are fairly reasonable. Pool towels are available at the pool. There is a kids pool, hot tub and a main pool. There are also two outside showers around the pool area. As previously mentioned we were there during a sold out week and while busy we always managed to get a chair. My only wish is that parents would teach their kids to observe the pool rules (such as no diving and all kids must be accompanied by an adult). This is not really the hotels responsibility, but did see kids misbehaving as there was no parental influence. Location - I loved the location of this hotel. There is a 24 hour super walmart 3 miles up the road and also a winn dixies, walgreens, gas stations and various restaurants in the other direction on the 535. Drivers in Orlando can be crazy so I enjoyed being able to use Palm Parkway and Turkey Lake Road (back road) to get almost anywhere and avoid the I4 highway. The 535 road however can have a lot of traffic. We just avoided it at peak times. Overall this hotel was perfect. The only thing we missed was a balcony off the room, but knew this wasn't an option before we booked this property. We felt secure as a room key is required to get in all entrances (except main lobby) and when we did deactivate our key one day we had to show id to get it reprogrammed again.

Staff was very nice and showed their appreciation for people (guests) choosing their hotel.

The noise level or lack of noise level does not suggest a hotel of kids but they were all staying at the hotel. The hotel is next door to another hotel and situated in a quiet area at the end of a road with an empty filed across the street being prepared for development. Travel down the road at few miles in one direction and you find shopping centers and restaurants and quick access to Route 4, which brings you to Disney. Travel the road in the opposite direction for three miles and you find a Walmart operating 24/7, which is where we purchased a few grocery basics at a decent price. The only flaw I experienced, which was minor, is the chance a few guests might not find a parking space if they return to the hotel late at night, such as after midnight. That happened to us one night and we parked on the island in the middle of the entranceway along with four or other five guests. The island is on the hotel grounds and not on the public street.

The room appeared smaller than the other room I had in the other hotel. We had 2 queen beds and the bathroom was in the bedroom by our beds. No big deal as it was just my 2 girls, 19 & 14 and I. The full kitchen was at the entrance to the room and there was a chaise lounge with a tv in this room and a tv in the bedroom. This is a big deal as one of my kids tend to hog the tv so no issues with this. The room was quite with no outside noise. The breakfast was a full size. My only complaint (to myself) was that some items tend to get cold at the buffet. Seating was sufficient. Breakfast was extended to 11:00 am which I like. My girls were at this point of the vacation feeling sick with a cold so they were resting and sleeping eg. they had a lazy day but we still had 1 more day to do Universal Studios. The day we went was a very cold day and we cut it short one hour to come back here. The pool area was really lovely but we hit a couple days of cold so we didn't use it. The sun somehow did not shine by the pool area. We did use the hot tub as that was very relaxing. We also had the managers reception on Wednesday and Thursday. The Wednesday reception was good; pasta with alfredo sauce, garlic bread, salad and I think another pasta. The drinks I think were unlimited but I had the wine and a beer. The bar was at the pool. Not that many people at the reception. My girls enjoyed their time with me and asked to stay another night. It was great. There is lots of restaurants around the area but not within walking distance.

Quick Note: The shuttle bus was very convenient and was not too busy as it only served one other hotel right next door. However for those used to staying at an on-site Disney Resort, this shuttle bus drops you off in a different parking lot about a 5 minute walk away. While the only stop is Epcot do not let that discourage you as you are now in the hands of Disney transportation system which is probably the most stress free travel experience I ever had. From Epcot you can take a Disney bus to the Animal Kingdom, Magic Kingdom or Hollywood Studios. If you are tired of busses, you can also take the monorail to Magic Kingdom from Epcot (my favorite) or go through Epcot and come out the other entrance and take a boat or walk around the beautiful and fun Boardwalk to Hollywood Studios.

I couldn't move to another room because the hotel was booked solid that night. The next morning I got up and the smell was still there so I went down to the lobby, told the clerk & was immediately able to have my room changed. The staff person that helped move my luggage explained since the rooms are \"extended stay\" type rooms, people often cook in the kitchen and sometimes the smells carry throughout the rooms but they deodorize the rooms when situations such as that occur. The breakfast was great with a wide variety and selection of items to choose from. The only negative I have about the hot items is that they often times when I picked out something and tasted it, it wasn't hot. This is no big deal since the rooms have microwaves.

We booked two king studio rooms, one two bedroom suite, and one, one bedroom accessible suite with a roll in shower. We had guests ages 9 years to 70 years. We had a great time! The staff was mostly very helpful and friendly. The rooms were very clean and welcoming. The beds were comfortable, but a little high for the short folks among us. We had one slight housekeeping issue that was taken care of immediately and with a smile. This location, while not on the Disney property, was very convenient. We did have to drive to get to a restaurant, but not too far. There was a card in the room entitled Room Service which had several different restaurants on it. We were all tired from traveling all day, and ordered pizza. It took over an hour and a half for it to arrive and the price for two large pizzas and one order of cheese sticks was over $60, including the mandatory tip. Later we saw boxes in the hall from Pizza Hut and other chain pizza restaurants, and we wished we had ordered directly. The breakfast was one of the best we have seen at a Residence Inn and everyone in our group was pleased. There were several different types of dry cereals, oatmeal, grits, fresh fruits, yogurt, waffles, scrambled eggs, a different meat daily among bacon, link sausage, sausage patties and canadian bacon. There were waffles to be self made, in the shape of Mickey Mouse............the kids loved doing this. There were bagels, muffins and toast, cut up fruit for granola and oatmeal, and make it yourself breakfast burritos or something similar each day. There were orange and another juice, coffee, tea, and cocoa mix. That was a great way to save money while going to amusement parks nearby, which were all expensive. The pool area was very nice, and had a bar. The kids actually swam at the end of November, although they did say it was cold, and they only did it once. Adults contented themselves with the hot tub and just visiting outside. Only downside to pool area was that you could not bring drinks in, you HAD to buy them on property. We're not sure if that meant you could buy them in the little store in the lobby, or whether you had to buy them at the bar. Some of our party did buy beer from the bar and thought it was a bit spendy. We should have asked for clarification on this issue, but we didn't. We really enjoyed our stay and would book again at this reasonably priced hotel. The only negative I can think of was that when we met in the lobby at 4am on our departure day, and wanted to check out, the desk attendant did not acknowledge our presence or even say hello for about ten minutes. He was busy doing something, and I guess he didn't feel that acknowledging the guests standing at the desk was one of his duties. That is the first unfriendly person I have seen dealing with the public at any Marriott property. Perhaps he should be working behind the scenes instead of at the front desk, or maybe he was having a bad day. All in all, it was a great stay, and we appreciate the hotel taking such good care of us and making us, for the most part, feel so very welcome.

Location: We couldn't be happier with the Residence Inn. By being at the end of a long row of hotels just outside the Disney World properties, it gives the feel of being \"off the beaten path\". I would recommend reserving a room a little higher up that faces into the pool area. Affordability: We got a great rate just by booking directly through the Marriott website. Additionally, the property has a tremendous breakfast buffet which is included in the price of the room -- literally saving this group of 6 close to $70 - 80 per day! Not to mention, we also took advantage of the hotel's complimentary afternoon/evening snacks in the cafe. Service: Here's why I decided to write this review. It's a shame that bad service experiences prompt more reviews than good ones, so here's my attempt to show off how happy we were with this hotel: After day 3 of our stay, my wife and mother-in-law decided to do some laundry. After going back to pull out the second load of darks from the laundry room (each floor has its own) they discovered it missing from the dryer. Chaos ensued. Accusations of lack of safety, poor service, and ultimately robbery were made of the hotel staff. The GM took it upon himself to rectify the situation, having us make a list of all the items we thought were in that load, searching every laundry room on his own up and down the hotel. After about an hour of searching, a knock came to our hotel room door. The GM had a pair of my boxers in his hand -- still damp. It turns out, my mother-in-law had never transferred the load from the wash to the dryer, yet still put $1.50 in the dry and hit \"run\". Needless to say, apologies were made.

Let me start this by saying that I was overall happy with the stay. The staff is extremely nice and was very helpful. We checked in and was given our room quickly. The reasoning for the 3.5 star to 4 instead of 5 is because this hotel is showing serious age. There was only one slow elevator in the building we were staying in but I never waited very long. The cabinets were actually falling apart some and the oven in one of the rooms did not work very well. There was an obvious repair to the ceiling in the first room and the lighting in the bathroom wasn't the best. The furniture was also showing serious signs of old age and use. The room did have three new and fairly large flatscreen TVs in the room. I had a family suite which was perfect for my group. A large king bedroom with the bathroom and closet and then a small kid\u2019s themed room with two single beds. The room was very clean and the beds were nice. Although tucked next to I4, I didn't hear much traffic noise from the second room and none at the first. To explain a bit about the two rooms. We returned one night, out of three night stay, to find ourselves locked out of the room. I ran to the desk and learned that there was major roof leak and our room had to be moved. In their defense, they did try calling the number on the booking but the phone was left behind. They also sent a staff member to help pack up the room and move our stuff one floor down and management called within minutes to discount the one night stay. I'm sure they could of done more but we were happy with the staff's response and had a great rate anyway. We went from a pool view to the room next to I4, but all in all, it was still pretty good. The breakfast buffet is a plus and takes out the worrying about what to feed the kids in the morning. The location is great, especially if you know how to get around this area. It is very close to Downtown Disney and Seaworld. I can't speak on the transportation, but there is a shuttle service offered. The stay was interesting, to say the least, but work out perfect for our needs. I have stayed at every hotel on Disney property and many off. This hotel was perfect for a 3 day trip with young kids.

The place seemed nice with a living rm area, full kitchen and separate bdrm. After staying there for 1 night, the next morning I noticed that my 10 yr. old daughter had numerous large bites on her arms and legs. I didnt know much about bed bugs so I wasnt sure if that's what it was. She complained about them being itchy. So I did some research on the internet and found they come out at night as soon as there is a warm body in the bed. We did a brief visual search of the mattress before she laid down but didnt see anything. Since I had to go buy something in the lobby I told my husband to ck the bed after she had laid down and the lights were off (about after a half hour). I got a call from him saying \"They're here right in the bed. There were numerous bloated ones full of blood inches away from her!!!\" Obviously they had just feasted on her. I ran to the front desk. I was hysterical, never imaging this could happen to us. It was about 11:30 p.m. I screamed, \"you have bed bugs here!\" There was a young girl at the desk who didnt seem to know what to do. I demanded they either move me immediately to another room or another hotel. I told them I would not pay one penny for this. She called a maintenance man to accompany me to help move us. I returned to the room to find my daughter crying and scared. All at once we had to pack up all our belongings and uproot my family in the middle of the night. The little one also was in tears. We were moved to a higher floor (this occurred on the 1st floor, I believe it was #105). We went to the 5th floor. The maintenance guy stripped the sheets and checked the pillows.He assured us it was okay. We had a very long night (it was about 2:00 am when we finally laid down). My daughter had a difficult time sleeping, worried about being bitten again). My husband collected some of the bugs in a cup to show the front desk girl, as proof. The next day the manager apologized to me. However, we just wanted to get out of there and go back home to NJ. This totally ruined our vacation. We were too tired and distressed to enjoy anything else. The bottom line was that the Marriott paid for my dry cleaning, which took 3 months to receive. (we went in May and got reimbursed in July. They refused to pay for an inspection of my home(just in case we brought some back). Now for all my daughter's trauma and a ruined vacation, the insurance company offered me $50 for her pain and suffering. I just wanted them to be fair with me and at least offer me complimentary future accommodations perhaps at any of their Marriott hotels with no strings attached for a nice vacation. Sure the mgr. insisted on wanting to give me a free stay only on Fri.s or Sats, on a Residence Inn subject to availability of a particular code, where not all accept this, depending on their location. However, the attitude of the insurance company was disgusting. They showed absolutely no compassion for what my little girl went through, and just dismissed this as a small inconvenience. I will never stay with them again. I work for a major airline and believe me, my hundreds of customers and co-workers will be informed of the unprofessionalism of the Marriott and the lack of empathy for its guests.

Decided to come down with the family (wife & two girls: 8 year old & 19 months), but thought staying at a standard room at the Hilton would be too cramped. Plus, we have assorted allergies & dietary preferences so we needed a place with a fridge. As I have Marriott Rewards, this was a no-brainer. We chose this property over the Residence Inn near Sea World because it was a bit closer to the meeting and had been more recently improved. The property was very easy to get to from the airport off of I-4 - just a few right turns and you're there! Parking was ample & free. We went for a two king-size bed room since it was priced similarly to other options. It turned out to be an excellent decision! The room opened to a kitchen/living area with a flat screen TV, and a king size bed and full bath just off the room. Kitchen had a table for 4 and the living area had an easy chair & a couch (sleeper, I believe). The other king was in a separate bedroom with another full bath. Liked having two bathrooms! There was a good-sized fridge, plates/glasses/utensils as well as a sink, oven (& cookware), a microwave and a dishwasher. Found the room to be very clean upon arrival, though I pity the person who had to clean it after we left... The hotel offers a *free* breakfast with eggs, sausage, biscuits, typical breads & spreads, waffles/pancakes (or something you could put syrup on, because there were packages of syrup aplenty), fruit & fruit juices. More than a continental but slightly less than an all-out buffet. The hotel has a decent-sized pool and an adjoining spa (hot tub) with plenty of poolside seating. There is also a small food stand/bar. Other amenities include a coin operated washer & dryer on each floor ($1.50 each), ice (only on the first floor), soda machine on each floor, game room, single computer & printer (\"business center\"), discounted tickets to all the parks & attractions (not just Disney) and a shuttle to Epcot that left at three a.m. times: 7:55, 9:55 and 11:55. The location was a short drive to Downtown Disney, International Drive, tons of restaurants and provided easy access to the Disney parks (being close to I-4). Even though the property backs up to I-4, we weren't bothered by any road noise. It's also just a few miles from a Whole Foods, where we got our additional provisions. The only downside was that our stroller got stolen out of our trunk, although it's unclear whether it happened on the property or at the Hilton where I drove to for work. In any event, it's always wise to lock your car doors. Also, the alarm went off throughout the whole hotel for a few minutes one night because someone burned their toast.

It's always difficult to get to I-4 or Downtown or the parks just because of the traffic. Get used to it, it's still better than being out on International Drive or somewhere like that.

Found that the accommodations were nice, but not even close to the cleanest hotel I\u2019ve stayed at. The first room we were put in had a noise in the furnace/AC compartment that would have driven us crazy. When I called down they sent up a technician. That is when the best thing happened, we got upgraded the family suit. (The room as not as clean as I like, I\u2019ll bet the carpet hadn\u2019t been cleaned for a long time.) The 3 flat screens HD TV\u2019s were nice (but no wires to hook up laptop). There was a microwave, full fridge, and dish washer. The pool area was clean, but I never once seen the pool being cleaned. There was lots of \u201cstuff\u201d in the pool \u2013 Band-Aids, dirt/sand, black algae etc\u2026. stuff that should be cleaned out. I don\u2019t know what acceptable standards are for a pool, but they were on the line. The help in this hotel is very good. I just think its what they have to work with that isn\u2019t that good. I have to say that the breakfast buffet was the best I\u2019ve seen and I\u2019ve stayed in a lot of hotels that offer the free breakfast. They had cereal, fresh fruit, waffles, breakfast meat, and juice. This was the best part of our stay. (I just hope that the kitchen is cleaner then the rooms.) The hotel is only 5 miles from Disney World and was very convenient. My main complaint is this: Bed Bugs\u2026 I myself got bitten by them. When I first asked about my spots when at the Universal Park first aid the Dr on staff there did not hesitate to say they were bed bug bites. When I asked about it to the Mgr on duty he told me that they had \u201cnever\u201d had an issue with bed bugs. But then I spoke to other managers who didn\u2019t seem as confident. I seen other people at the pool with worse cases of bites then I got. But when I spoke to the front desk about what I seen, I was told that \u201cunless the people come talk to us, how will we know\u201d. That kind of position is un-professional\u2026. I like staying at a hotel where the management is proactively keeping the location clean and free of bugs instead of pretending that they don\u2019t exist. The breakfast is not good enough to overpower the thought of getting bits at night. This hotel needs a deep cleaning, carpets, tile and the pull out sofa beds need new mattresses. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d stay in this location again or refer. Plus the wireless internet was very slow and impossible to stay connected.

One often wonders if the reviews are all genuine. My experience with this hotel is emphatically YES. We found the name of the hotel manager, Maria Martinez, in many of the reviews and they all had glowing things to say. Since we were booking three suite and 14 family members I knew we wanted to be close together. Upon reading additional reviews we agreed that we would like a high floor away from the highway noise (which we thought was nearly non-existent while there). I called the hotel and requested the managers e-mail and without hesitation they gave it to me - that was a good sign as well. I wrote her requesting the above items and she saw to it that it was taken care of. Our family was tickled to be on the top floor, close together and the cousins could run back and forth from room to room to play. That in itself was perfect. At check in they knew immediately that we were the family requesting rooms close together (made us feel special). Once inside our two bedroom suite we were more than pleased with what we found. The rooms were clean, attractive and the kitchen was more than adequate. The refrigerators have ice makers so no need to be running down the hall to get ice. Also the perfect place to freeze beverages before a day at the park. We used the pool almost daily (there are towels provided) and the children loved it. It was never too crowded. I should also mention that parking was always easy - seemed that there were always extra spaces even though the hotel was full. The housekeeping staff is very friendly and accommodating. The location of the hotel is excellent - just minutes from everything. If you are looking for groceries like our family was, just ask the front desk where the Winn-Dixie is. It is actually walkable but only two minutes by car. Go the opposite way and there is a Wal-Mart just 4-5 minutes away by car. We purchased most of our Disney gear there. They have a whole department that is nothing but Disney. Usually half the price of similar items found in the park. Go there first. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet each morning (we stayed 8 days). The staff works like crazy to keep all of the food fresh and full. There is something for everyone. Arrive early for the least chaos and best choice of seating. If you arrive 30 minutes before breakfast is finished you will find most tables full and more lines at the food lines. We were able to make waffles several times with a minimal wait. While the hotel provides a shuttle that we thought we would use we opted instead to drive to the park for more freedom to come and go as we pleased. Here is a tip that we found and want to pass on. Disney charges $14.00 to park at their theme parks but there is no charge to park at their water parks and some hotels. We parked daily in the lot across the street from the Boardwalk Resort behind a Hess station. The lot was always just half full so we didn't even have to arrive early. Across the street in front of the hotel is a Disney bus stop that takes you to Magic Kingdom or Animal Kingdom. Walk behind the hotel and you will find boats that will take you to Epcot or Hollywood Studios. It was a 20 minute trip from the hotel to the parking lots. There have been some comments on the internet. It worked well enough for us although a bit slow at times. It was nice to have the two computers and printers in their business center to use. I would be remiss if I didn't mention that they have a Manager's Reception three nights each week (Tue, Wed, Thur). One night it was meatloaf and mashed potatoes, next was soup and salad, then a bar-b-q with hamburgers and hotdogs. A really nice plus especially after a long day at the park and you just don't want to have to go out.

When you look around at the size of this Residence Inn and think about how many extra rooms there are, one can appreciate how it is no simple matter to put out such a massive breakfast. I expect the occupants per room is a bit higher than the normal residence inn also. I wish I could remember the first name of the very helpful young lady at the front desk, but I believe the GM may remember whom I was talking about. The two bedroom suites here are set out to be suitable for more people travelling. For example, one king bed and a desk in one bedroom, and two queens in the second bedroom.

It is a multi storey building, so if the people above you choose to be inconsiderate, you may hear some noise also. The best advice is that if you can't sleep for some reason, call the front desk. If the highway bothers you, there are people like me who don't care if they get a room by the highway (most are not). If the people upstairs are making noise, they need to get told to smarten up.

We will almost always stay at a Residence Inn whenever we go away on vacations. For us, Residence Inn has set the bar. In a nutshell: they are an exceptional value. The complimentary hot breakfast is a great value. Good tasting food. A good variety. This Residence Inn has a waffle maker with a Mickey Mouse shaped head which makes it fun to eat (for the kids of course). The variety changes very little on a day to day basis; scramble eggs are always there; sometimes there's sausage patties, sometimes bacon, sometimes both; bagels, toast, pastries, hot & cold cereals, yogurt with fresh fruit, etc (it goes on). I also appreciate it that they serve flavored coffee creamer as a choice. It is typical cafeteria-mass public consumption type of food but COMPLIMENTARY. So ignore the negative reviews about the food. My response to those people are: Don't eat it; Go waste your time getting dressed, drive somewhere, wait in line and pay for the similar tasting food elsewhere. Having breakfast in the hotel is a big time saver. One can either go there right before they head out or show up in your pj's like we did at times. They will also allow you to \"doggie bag\" something. The staff almost expects it. And speaking of staff, they are kind and respectful. They are very helpful during breakfast times in the dining area.

Everyone was always friendly and helpful- the person who checked us in; multiple people in the breakfast area; the person who cleaned our room; and the hotel general manager who answered a few questions for us. The most incredible staff person was named Carolina- she was always there at breakfast with a smile on her face. On the day we left, my kids tracked Carolina to give her a hug goodbye! The kitchen manager who worked breakfast on 4/17/11 was also great (I think her name was Katie?? I'm totally guessing). The one time they ran out of chocolate chips for about 2 minutes, she brought a bowl of the chips out to our table to make sure my son fully enjoyed his waffles. 2) The breakfast- hot breakfast which was always kept fully stocked. There was a great variety of food and it was very tasty!! Mickey waffles; bacon/sausage; variety of juices; flavored coffee creamers; oatmeal; fresh fruit- you name it, they had it! 3) Location- it was ~10 minutes from all the major sites. Overall- everything was great. For our family vacations, the hotel is usually just a place to sleep and change clothes. This time, the hotel was part of what made our vacation so great.

The shuttle service is convenient to Epcot only. The average commute via shuttle and then internal disney transportation to Magic Kingdom is 1.5 hours (not sure driving would be much better though). This is because it's a 10 minute walk from where the shuttle drops you off at Epcot to the security checkpoint where there's a line to check your bags. Then there's a line to the monorail which takes you to the transfer station. From there you need to either wait in another monorail line or the ferry line to the magic kingdom and then go through a security checkpoint again to finally get in the line to enter the magic kingdom.

The hotel was really nice and very clean. We stayed on the 3rd floor and found it to be very quiet even though there were lots of families staying there. The room itself was a decent size. It had a small kitchenette with a full size refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, a pantry, 2 burner stove, a breakfast bar with 2 stools, pots/pans and dishes/silverware and a desk with a lamp. Our room had a King size bed with a sleeper sofa. The bathroom had a nice vanity (sink) with a few drawers and a cabinet underneath the sink. The towels and washcloths were very soft and thick, not see through like some places. There was one dresser with 3 large drawers. The flat screen TV sat on top of the dresser which was located in between what would be the living room and bedroom areas. In the laundry facility, there were 2 washers and 2 dryers ($1.50 each) inside of a large room with a counter for folding, as well as a sink and hand towels. The room was very clean and had 2 chairs to sit in, which was nice because most places only have the washer/dryer. The breakfast area was awesome with a really good buffet. Of course, it was standard items \u2013 waffles, eggs, bacon, potatoes, sausage, toast, bagels, cereal, muffins, etc. There was only one Mickey Mouse waffle maker though so it could take a while to make one of those. The breakfast room was fairly large but could get very crowded. Since we were there in November it wasn\u2019t bad, but I\u2019d hate to see how crowded it would be in the middle of the summer when the park(s) are in full swing. Overall though it wasn\u2019t too bad because people were coming/going all the time. We didn\u2019t use the pool on this trip but we did get in the hot tub one night. It was wonderful \u2013 nice and toasty warm. I could smell the chlorine and from what I could see of it during the daytime, it looked really clean. It was too chilly outside for me to enjoy the pool but we did see people in there, especially in the morning hours. The only negatives I had (and they\u2019re small ones) \u2013 there was no in-room safe, the AC was a bit loud when it first comes on and the bathroom is right next to the bedroom so if you get up in the middle of the night and turn the light on, it could be bothersome for the other person in the bed. Only other issue I had was that the lobby computer was very slow and there are only 2 of them. Overall, I highly recommend staying at this Residence Inn.

There are only about 40 or so channels that are available. But the HD channels don't even show up. If you switch to an HD channel, all you see is a black screen with the words \"No Signal\" floating around. This is not acceptable from a hotel that is branded a Marriott.

If lower level chains like Days Inn and Econolodge can afford to provide their guests with good internet, Marriott should certainly be able to do this. This is 2011.

Overall, I give this hotel a 7 out of 10. We had a two bedroom suite with a king and two queen beds, which was nice size. The positives: Great pool/patio area and huge breakfast area, although still packed at peak time (around 9:00 am), but they had an overflow space. Hot selections were available. The manager\u2019s social Tue-Thu with food and free drinks (beer, wine, soft drinks) was nice and Thursdays had a cookout with burgers. Manager Maria was great and even served coffee at breakfast. Location is close to restaurants and attractions, although I believe a car is a must. Walking and shuttle schedule will not do it. Peak in season traffic at rush hour will add to the travel times \u2013learn the back routes and your will save I-4 rush hour traffic. Beds were very nice. Drawbacks: Although there was a complete kitchen with stove, there is no way you can cook daily for a family with the equipment provided: One small sauce pan and a frying pan. Dishes were 4 coffee cups, four wine glasses, four salad plates, and four very small bowls. If you stay here to save money and cook meals, you will need to bring pots and pans. Our room\u2019s carpet was also a mess - very stained and dirty, to the point we hated even going barefoot. It needed serious cleaning or replacement. Housekeeping also frequently did not replace dish towels and hand towels. After a day or two there, they shut down the juice machine at breakfast and from then on only a watery, fake juice mix was offered. I\u2019m not a techie, but they claim high speed internet service (not wireless) but it was very slow compared to home high speed service. Overall, staff was good, but one evening room next door had several very loud, playing, screaming kids an 1:30 a.m. We notified front desk, but it continued for another half hour. When we called back, they said the \u201cnight man\u201d walked the hall and didn\u2019t hear anything. We offered to let them come hear it from our bedroom and she said they understood, but nothing was done. We finally called the room directly at 2:15 a.m. and asked them to respect their neighbors and they immediately quieted down. Apparently the front desk is too worried about offending guests by dealing with the issue. Every day, offsite pizza delivery would stick flyers under the door, which meant these non guests had daily access (the hotel had a sign stating not to use them).

We have been to the Lake Buena Vista area for vacations dozens and dozens of times but this was the first business trip. We needed to stay for five weeks. Since we took two young children with us, we needed space. I discovered the Residence Inn on line and made the reservation. I was delighted with every aspect of our stay. Our stay included a breakfast buffet daily. The folks who work in the dining area were always so cheerful, kind and helpful. The food was wonderful - bacon, eggs, muffins, Mickey Mouse waffles, juices, and cereals. Our room was spacious and comfortable. We had a family suite which included a child's bedroom with a TV and twin beds. Since we homeschool our children, we were delighted to see the child size counter with child size chairs - the perfect spot for our school work. We also had a spacious bedroom with a king size bed, a bathroom with a separate sink area and a nice sized closet. My favorite part was the full kitchen. We had a full size refrigerator and there was no need to find the ice machine in the hallway - we had an ice maker in the room. All the ice we wanted, all the time!! We had a dishwasher and the maid filled it and started it whenever I forgot or did not have time. We had a full size stove and a microwave too. We also had free high speed internet service! The most surprising part was the $25 in Disney Dollars which we recieved for every night of our stay. I warned the children before we left home that this was some sort of gimmick and surely we would not get $25 in Disney Dollars or any other dollars. Imagine my amazement when the front desk manager asked me on the first day or our 34 night visit if I wanted all $850.00 now or did I want it each week!! They handed me $850 in Disney gift cards which I used for restaurants, gifts, fast food, you name it. I could spend it at the parks, the resorts and even the Disney store at the Florida Mall. We were so centrally located. We were five minutes down a non-busy road to a Wal-Mart. It is a Wal-Mart like none I have ever seen before. It is actually an upscale Wal-Mart (I did not know there was such a thing!). We were ten minutes from the Disney Parks. I could drive the kids to the parks more quickly than when we previously stayed on Disney property. The front desk was responsive to our every need. One night there was problem with a pool part and we experienced noise. When I called the front desk, they responded by giving us keys to a second room, just for sleeping so that we would not be required to move all of our things to another room. I have never been to a hotel which gave me access to two rooms at the same time. The rooms were quiet and decorated nicely. Even after five weeks, I was not sick and tired of that room even though I was a bit homesick. I would recommend the Residence Inn to anyone staying in the Lake Buena Vista area or the Orlando area.

The check-in experience was subpar. The first night I tried to cook a pizza in the oven, but while the oven was preheating, the room filled up with so much smoke that I had to turn it off - the oven obviously had not been cleaned in a long time. I called front desk and asked them to clean the oven the next day. Two days later I tried to use it again, and it had obviously not been cleaned at all. I called the front desk again and asked (again) for the oven to be cleaned, and they said they would send someone up right away, which they did (note that I did not receive an apology). A housekeeper appeared half an hour later with a can of oven cleaner and asked me what I wanted her to do. I shrugged and said \"Clean the oven\"? She asked me how, exactly, she should do it, and pointed out that the oven was warm, and that maybe it could be dangerous to do it while the oven was warm. She seemed annoyed at having to be there at all, so I said that it was fine with me if she came back in half an hour, but that got her even more irritated, since she informed me in no uncertain terms that she would be on her way home in half an hour. I then read the can, and showed her that it says on the can that the oven can be hot, but she said she might burn herself. So I opened the oven and carefully and quickly put my fingers on the heating element to see how warm it was, and then informed her that it was not that hot. She said that she couldn't take the risk, at which point I wrapped my hand around the element and held it there. After 10 seconds she rolled her eyes and said \"OK\", and started looking like she was preparing to actually - horror of horrors - clean the oven. At that point I grabbed the kids and we headed down to the pool, but we couldn't get into the pool - our card didn't work. We went to the front desk and explained that the pool gate wouldn't open, and they said that the pool gate we had tried often doesn't work, so just to try another. I was a bit stunned, but did as they said, and sure enough, the problem was with the gate. This problem persisted during our entire 2-week stay - they didn't bother to fix it. However since it took much longer to go around to the other gate, my 5-year old son came up with a solution - he could easily reach through the gate from underneath, and open it from the outside. Safe, eh? A 5 year old can open the gate and let himself into the pool area without an adult - mmmm. Once we got back to the room, my wife threw a pizza into the oven, but after 10 minutes we realized that our oven cleaning saga was not over - the room filled up with smoke. So no pizza that night - again. I called the front desk, who noted the problem and said they would fix the problem the next day (again, no apology - I'm just a Marriott Platinum member, who cares?). I was so disgusted that I took a photo of the oven, which had been completely sprayed with oven cleaner, but had not been wiped down, but I can't get the photo off my camera until I get home (will try and post it later). I could have gotten down on my hands and knees and cleaned the oven myself, like I do at home, but hey - isn't that why I'm staying at a hotel on vacation, to avoid having to do stuff like that? The next day they actually cleaned the oven (yippee), however the day after that housekeeping didn't show up at all. We didn't bother complaining. We're a family of 5, and since there were only 4 plates and sets of cutlery (despite the fact that we booked the room for 5 people), had brought up additional plates and cutlery from breakfast. They disappeared. Again, and again, and again - despite repeated calls to front desk, asking them not to take them. Housekeeping also threw out things which weren't trash - repeatedly, even when we hid them behind the TV, in a futile attempt to avoid the problem. Nothing really important, but just stuff we didn't want thrown out. Finally we asked to talk to a manager about all the problems we had, and after that, housekeeping stopped taking out trash that we put under the sink next to the trash bin, which wouldn't fit in the bin - groan. The final straw came on New Year's Eve, when we all put on party hats, brought out the chilled Champagne, and lightly pan-fried some awesomely thick Ahi Tuna steaks. There's no extractor fan in the kitchen, and the frying pan isn't non-stick, so we opened the windows before we started cooking. Despite that, the smoke detectors went off - big time. The sound was so loud, my kids started crying. Even my 9 year-old was crying, saying that her ears hurt. I am seriously worried about damage to their hearing - it was *that* loud. Of course we stopped cooking immediately, opened the door to the corridor, and I called front desk and asked for someone to come up to turn the smoke detectors off, but no-one came, and it seems the smoke detectors in this hotel won't turn themselves off automatically, they need to be manually reset. Finally I called again, and I'm a very calm person, but I told them in no uncertain terms that someone had to come NOW and turn the smoke detectors off, since we just couldn't take it any longer. Finally someone came and turned them off, but our New Year's Eve was completely ruined - my wife was hysterical, and my kids just wanted to go to bed. The next day I booked us into another hotel, and the day after that we checked out (2 weeks earlier than planned), and driving out of there, we just felt a huge sense of relief to put it all behind us.

We played at the parks all day and came back and would swim and hang out in the hot tub in the evening. The front desk staff were very helpful when we needed directions or asked a question. The breakfast had enough options, and warm food. It was good, not great. But for free - it definitely worked for us and was enough. I would suggest making sure your room faces the pool, as at least one of the sides of the building faces I-4. We never heard any noise on our side. We used the free shuttle service to Disney on one day. It took a little longer getting there, but not bad.

We researched the hotel online and saw the great reviews so we were excited to get a 2 bedroom residential suite. Needless to say our troubles had just begun! We checked in and went to the room they assigned- where my toddler son found a condom wrapper on the side of the bed, and a hand towel that was wadded up on the bed next to the condom wrapper. Also, every time the door to that bedroom was shut the small closet to I believe the heater? opened with dirty q-tips laying on the floor. So we decided not to leave and give the hotel another chance... we understand sometimes housekeeping does NOT do their jobs! Second room, different level-we go in and their is a VERY strong chemical odor, we could not figure out what it was other than my husband being told the carpets were recently cleaned and maybe it was the chemicals used to clean the floors. We decided that we would not complain and just open the windows. After being in the room for about 20 minutes we all started feeling faint, had very bad headaches and felt nauseous. My toddler decided that he would take off his shoes and he immediately said told us that his feet were wet. Huh?? So we took off our sandles and sure enough the carpets were soaking wet!!!! I guess the concierge had forgotten to mention that the carpets were JUST cleaned!! Finally after my husband calling down to front desk and complaining that now we were in our second room and hello?! They then put us in another room on again another level and everything seemed perfect...after 2 and a half hours of switching from room to room to room we finally made it to downtown disney right at dinner rush. When we got back to the room we had a message to call down, they gave us a free night which made us feel alittle better, and brought us a large goody bag with wine and food. After waking up and packing up to leave Orlando my sister pulls down her sheets to make sure she didn't leave any phone accessories and what does she find?? A pair of earrings that were NOT hers or any of ours! We we're disgusted, but what else could we do? We will not be staying at this hotel again!

The dining area was large, and the breakfast buffet was better than most Residence Inns we have stayed in. The hot options were a bit lacking, but it was complimentary. The Mickey waffle makers were a big hit. The pool was larger than most hotel pools, and the surrounding area was nice. There was a small toddler wading pool in the shade, which I definately appreciated. There weren't any more pool towels available one evening, but the staff was quick to respond and bring more. We stayed in the Aruba section on the third floor overlooking the pool. It did get a bit noisy at times, but it wasn't enough to interrupt anything. The room itself felt a little damp, but that seems par for the course in Florida. The room appears to have been recently updated in some aspects, but it felt shabby in others. The TV's were older, and there was one VCR in the living area. Who uses VCRs anymore? I was disappointed to discover this Residence Inn did not have wireless access like many others we have stayed in. The connection was also very slow. The kitchen area was clean but a bit outdated. Parts of the room were in disrepair.. one shower rod was barely hanging on, the carpet was coming up outside the bathroom door, and the door handle fell off one evening when we were leaving. The beds were comfortable, the cable tv options were plentiful, and overall the room was clean and comfortable. Our room did feel a bit far away from the lobby and dining area. There are lots of dining and entertainment options near the hotel, but you will need a car to reach them. Several local restaraunts do offer delivery (Chili's and TGI Friday's are among the choices, as well as Italian, Indian, and Chinese restaraunts.

The drivers were content to watch my try to juggle a toddler, stroller, and bag without ever offering to lend a hand, yet they still expected me to tip them.

You can't expect a lot of view though, most rooms are facing the parking lot. Breakfast is complimentary. While they don't have an extensive selection, they have breakfast favourites like pancakes, bacon, eggs, hash brown, oats/grits, fruits and Mickey waffles--just good to fuel you up before you start a theme-park day. The inn has a mini-store at the lobby, but I suggest buying your stuff like water and grocery items on stores nearby as the items in their mini-store are expensive. People in the lobby are friendly and are always there to answer any queries. They offer free food and drinks every afternoon of weekdays (Mon-Thu) at the pool area (food varies every day), but we didn't actually availed of it as we were usually out.

This hotel is located in a cluster of three hotels near Seaworld. It's near Seaworld and near restaurants and shopping but a car really is required to enjoy the area. We had a rental so the free parking was one of three main reasons why I chose this hotel. I stayed at this hotel in a one bedroom suite for 4 nights with my teen-aged son. The bedroom had two beds and there was a pull-out sofa in the living room. Check in quick and the suite itself is very nice, clean and spacious. I liked the fact that the bathroom and sink area are separate so two people can get ready at the same time. The kitchen area has a dishwasher, two burner stove, full-size microwave oven and full-size refrigerator - and all were clean inside and out. Free internet was the second reason why I chose this hotel - it can only be accessed at the (small) dining room table. Most hotels only have one access point for wired internet in the room, so I wasn't put off about it. The third reason why I chose this hotel is for the free breakfast buffet. It is free but I'd didn't like the hot options so I was a little disappointed there. Greasy sausage, powdered eggs, soggy corned beef hash does not equal decent food IMO. To be fair, there was also bagels, bread, juices, milk, and cereal being served so you had a choice of being healthy or not. We stayed in the Aruba section which requires a key card to access the building. That being said, three times a day, we were bombarded with local pizza shops sliding their menus under the door every morning, noon, and night. Housekeeping would just place the menus on the desk or leave on the floor for us to pick up and discard. Housekeeping also likes to knock on the door at 8 a.m. if you don't have the Do Not Disturb sign out. I didn't have it out, but I just felt it was a little rude and off-putting on bang on doors at 8 a.m. for people that weren't checking out. Also, the bathroom toilet ran very slow. You had to hold the lever down for about 20 seconds in order for it to flush completely. I also think they should do away with the VCRs and upgrade to DVD players just because it's 2009 and DVDs are more widely used. The pool area looks nice but we didn't use it. The printer in the business room doesn't work properly but the desk clerk let me use her computer behind the front desk to print my documents. She even faxed them for me for free so that was cool. All in all, between the free parking, free internet access, and free breakfast I probably saved about $45 per day. I enjoyed two out of three so I'm satisfied. I would recommend this hotel to others.

So I read some reviews on tripadvisor and picked this hotel for me and a few family and friends who were coming in for the festivities. Next to my beautiful bride, it is the best choice I have made in a long time. The pool was wonderful if a bit crowded at times; the free beer and snacks everyday at 5 was a nice touch; the free breakfast was more than adequate; the place was clean; the workout room had up-to-date cardio equipment and free weights; the beds were comfy and the rooms were quiet...but that was not the best part of our stay. No, the best part was the staff headed up by the affable, hard-working GM George, who set just the right tone. You really got the feeling (believed) that they wanted their guests to have the best stay possible. And in all candor, once they found out we were in town to be married the service soared.

We used the laundry facilities (there is no change machine but the bartender made change for us). In general the staff wasn't doting but did their job well and the manager saved one of our mornings by jumpstarting our car very quickly, which we greatly appreciated!!!!! For us, the location was ideal since we did have a car. It is really as close as some of the Disney properties and it is extremely convenient to Sea World and Discovery Cove. If you turned right you could avoid the congestion and get to things like WalMart, groceries, etc. We got a note prior to Thanksgiving Day explaining that service would be minimal for the actual holiday and to let them know in advance if we required anything more. I appreciated this as I think it shows they treat their employees with respect and that is important to me and I think it shows in the attitude. I think they handled it very well.

The hotel ambassador, Michael, was very helpful with any questions we had about getting to and from places we were interested in visiting and about places to eat.

Plus, because we are a family with a disability, we like to stay in places that have two bedrooms for many different reasons. We consisted of myself, my husband, who is in a wheelchair, daughter age 14 and son age 8, and in a separate room my sister and brother in law. I would've given this place a 5 star/excellent rating but we had some issues with the room we ended up with. We booked a two bedroom assessible room with my sister in law who owns a travel agency and because we have the handicapped accessibility issues, she always double checks our reservations because we have had problems in the past trying to get a room that is both handicapped accessible and is big enough for a family. This time, she called the hotel directily three times to make sure we had a two bedroom handicapped accessible room and all three times they said that is what we had for a reservation. . But, the room we ended up with when we got there was a one bedroom, one bathroom, accessible room with a pullout couch. My sister and brother in law came to check on us and couldn't believe that they had a two bedroom, two bathroom that they could get lost in and we had no place to put our luggage and a wheelchair. So, I ended up calling and going to the front desk to try to change our room to the original reservation of the 2 bedroom/handicapped accessible room. The lady at the front dest was really nice, but I still don't know if they actually had a 2 bedroom handicapped suite in the first place or if she was saying that it wasn't available for the whole week or what was going on, I did find out that they were booked full for the week, so it was hard to change anything. In the meantime, my sister and brother said that if we could get them a regular one bedroom (regular because a handicapped accessible bathroom doesn't have a tub) they would switch rooms with us because they felt bad that we were in such a small room for 4 of us and they had the 2 bedroom that they didn't need. I then went to the front desk and told the lady the situation and she did switch us to my sisters/brother in laws room (which was not handicapped accessible and a pain for my husband, but we are used to this because it happens all of the time to us, so we make due) and they switched my sister and her husband to a one bedroom with a view of the roof (I felt really bad about this but they were fine with it) and I did end up getting the hotel to knock $20.00 per night off their room. We did end up liking the room, two kings, a pullout couch, two bathrooms, kitchen area, for the price it was great/excellent. But, my poor husband is a trooper dealing with the lack of the handicapped accessible bathroom . Luckily I have some kind of muscle to help him out! The pool area was really nice, the breakfast was awesome, my 8 year old son was addicted to the Mickey Mouse Waffles. You do need a car rental to get everywhere. There were a lot of restaurants, etc, close by. Would stay here again if there is an actual 2 bedroom handicapped accessible room. I think hotels need to realize that there are actually handicapped families that travel together that need more bedrooms. In the past, we had one more child with us, but he happens to be in college and didn't go with us this time.

Living only a couple of hours away, we spend 5-6 weekends a year in Orlando and have stayed at several Orlando properties, including Disney hotels. I love staying at Disney hotels for the \"Disney experience\" but their suites are out of our usual budget. Therefore, this hotel ranks tops on my list for a suite. Check-in went smoothly. Despite not arriving until after 8 pm, the staff graciously accommodated my request when I asked for a pool-view room. It is close to I-4 and I was concerned about traffic noise; although the interior seems well sound-proofed, if you are a very light sleeper you might want to ask for a room facing away from the interstate. The staff at all hours was unfailingly polite, helpful and efficient. Our housekeeper even arranged all of our child's stuffed animals in playful poses and left us a very nice note. The room was spotlessly clean and seems to have been redecorated or renovated within the last few years. The small kitchen had full-size appliances including a refrigerator, stove, microwave, dishwasher and coffee maker. It was fully stocked with pots, pans, dishes, glasses, utensils, etc. The kitchen table was small but adequate for four people. The beds were soft but not too soft, with soft sheets and plenty of pillows. Both bedrooms (one with a king, one with 2 queens) had full bathrooms. The living room area had a chaise lounge instead of a full couch, which I found odd, and a club chair. There were 25\" televisions in the living room and in each bedroom. Contrary to previous reviews, there was free wireless internet access in the room, not just wired. There was a free wired access port located at the kitchen table as well. The complimentary breakfast buffet always featured scrambled eggs, two different meats (bacon, sausage patties or links, corned beef hash, etc), grits and some sort of bread (such as biscuits or pancakes). There was also a make-your-own waffle station, bread and bagels for toasting, a breakfast taco station, and plain oatmeal with brown sugar, cinnamon, raisins and nuts to add in if you wished. The cold bar offered granola, several varieties of cereal, strawberry and plain yogurt, fruit salad and bananas. For beverages, coffee, hot tea, orange juice, apple juice and milk. The food was as good as some Denny's breakfasts I've paid for, and there was plenty of staff on hand restocking with fresh food and clean plates, and clearing tables. Self-parking was free, and we did not have a problem finding a parking space. We noticed cars parked out front on the street every morning, but I think that was because they did not wish to drive around back where there were plenty of available spaces. The hotel had an exercise room but we did not use it. The pool somewhat small and plain for families used to slides and fountains at Disney \"theme\" pools. However, it was clean, never crowded and plenty of pool towels were on hand. Given that we stayed during prime spring break week, I really expected that the breakfast buffet, pools, parking lots, etc, would be crowded but did not find that to be the case. Given that a our rate of $189 a night included free breakfast, free internet access, free parking, two separate bedrooms and a full kitchen, I'd say it was a bargain. I will definitely recommend it to friends and family, and would stay there again in the future.", "Date": "April 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "Kodie123", "ReviewID": "UR14352621", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for March Break week.

I give this hotel rating a 4.5 out of 5. The rooms were very clean and the beds were extra comfortable. I repeat... EXTRA COMFORTABLE!!! I fell asleep way to easy on that bed. The bathroom was clean, average size and the shower head had good water pressure. All the rooms are equipped with nice full kitchens (w/ microwave and coffee maker) and living rooms. They even give you complimentary popcorn, tea, coffee! I was very impressed with cable tv because we had EVERY cable station (about 50 or 60 cable channels). It was great having the option of ESPN for me and HGTV for my girlfriend. The rooms also have VCR's and if you want they have a video rental machine in the lobby! The free breakfast was good. They switched up the menu everyday and they had a nice variety of food. They also offer free food @ night during the weekdays (like hot dogs, pizza, etc). The hotel also has a video arcade that has air table hockey and about 5 arcade game systems. The fitness center is average size and clean. The service @ the hotel was beyond excellent. EVERYONE was very helpful and went out of their way to accomadate our needs. The only reason i'm not giving the hotel a full 5 star rating is because of it's location. Let me explain.... the hotel is located on a long road where there is nothing but hotels, restaraunts and shops. The only thing wrong is it's located @ the very of the street. Even thought it was ony about a mile away from the Disney property, i just felt like it was selcluded from everything else. Everyone i talked to seemed to enjoy that aspect. The street has a variety of stores different eating places, even a Hooters (hidden in the back of an outdoor mall). Oh yea.. and the area super safe!!!

We reserved a 2 bedroom room for our family- husband, wife and 2 teens. The two private bedrooms each have adjoining bathrooms and are separated by the family room and kitchen. Upon arrival, we were assigned our room on the 4th floor. A beautiful, spacious room- 2 queen beds for the teens and a king bed for the parents- unfortunately it was on the backside of the building, next to the freeway. Even after a very long day of jetting across the USA, we weren't so tired as to not hear the freeway traffic at 3:00 in the morning. We were anxious to visit the Magic Kingdom the next day and start our vacation. My husband talked to the staff at the front desk and they told him for us to pack our luggage and they would move us to a different room while we went to Disney World. We were thrilled to return to a pool side room on the first floor- same 2 bedroom size room. The staff even saw my note on the frig in the first room, that we had put food/drinks inside- that all got moved to our new room. I really enjoy having a kitchen when we travel. The Residence Inn rooms have a full size frig, 4 burner stove and oven, dishwasher, etc. I recommend the Publix grocery stores in town, don't go to the nearest little tourist trappy ones, the prices are outrageous as we found out our first night there. We bought stuffed salmon at Publix, baked it in our oven, microwaved potatoes, had green salad and bread as dinner for a couple of nights. We bought flats of bottled water as water away from home always tastes funky. I'd partially freeze them for our treks to the Disney Parks. A great tip I read from some genius traveler is to take a zip lock baggie of Tang or Crystal Light with you into the Parks and fill your water bottle as needed throughout the day. We did that several times- my big kids really appreciated it, and I didn't have to reach for my wallet. The comp breakfast at Residence really is impressive- you can really tank up before a full day of walking and rides. Housekeeping did a wonderful job cleaning our room, fluffing our luxurious beds and replenishing supplies. There is coin operated laundry available ($1.50 a load, uses quarters). My kids used the pool late in the evenings- proved to be a good teen hangout.

Abundance of towels at the pool, I dont think the tent that held the towels was ever even close to being empty. mY 10 year old daughter loved the pool (it wasnt huge) but didnt get deeper than 5 ft but again, the grounds were spotless, pool was spotless. Hot tub was a nice place to relax in after walking all day at the theme parks. Breakfast was great alot of food from scrambled eggs, waffles, danishes, cereal, biscuits/gravy, fruit, granola, juices, bagels, toast. Not to far from disney/mgm/epcot.

I informed my husband to see if we could check in early. We did!!!. We stayed on the 5th floor in a family fun suite, overlooking the pool. The room was very clean, and my kids, ages 5 and 8, loved their sleeping area. The room included 3 televisions. One in the kids sleeping area, living room area, and the bedroom area. I described the room space as areas, because there are no doors that separate the rooms. I do believe you can get a Family Fun Suite with separate rooms with doors, but I don't believe you will have a view of the pool. The breakfast was great; again my kids loved the Mickey Mouse Waffles. Every morning there is a variety of different things on the breakfast bar. The staff also greeted you every morning at the dining area door. We were supposed to go to two theme parks at Disney during our stay, but changed our minds. Our kids loved the swimming pool so much; that they didn't even noticed that we didn't make it to the second theme park. Because of this we decided to stay at the hotel an extra day. This saved us a lot! Also try to call the hotel directly to book a room. We were able to use the government rate and saved almost $100.00.

The room and the hotel was really clean and smelled fresh. The breakfast area was a true bargin. Lots of great food and the staff kept everything fresh. The complimentary concierge was a huge help. She milled about during breakfast handing out stickers to the kids. There was also a timeshare agent who gave us her business card and asked us to stop by her desk when we got a chance. We stayed a whole week at this hotel and that is the only time she had approached us. They are very hands off which is nice. We never did stop by either. Maybe we should have! I needed directions to the superwalmart. I asked at the front desk and was promptly handed a type page with great directions.

Why doesn't housekeeping make the sofa bed just like they make other beds? The rooms were immaculate. The king sized bed was total heavan.

It is hard to understand as they seem well maintained and there was not much traffic on them, but it took forever for them to move from one floor to the next.

Orange juice did not seem too sweet to me, and the coffee was not horrid either.

Of course they were not able to accomodate my request for early check-in. What a surprise! We went to lunch and then waited in the lobby for two hours before our room was ready. My parents checked into their room to find that the clearly marked \"non-smoking\" room smelled like a chimney! Marriott took 3 hours to have someone come to remove the odor and then commented to my parents that they were disappointed by the call they received from Marriott Customer Care officials regarding my parents complaint about the smoke. Well, if they had to wait 3 hours to be attended to they would complain as well. On day 5 of our stay we ventured out to the pool only to find that it was full of dead insects and other debris. Disgusting! According to their website they serve a hot breakfast from 6:30am - 10:45am. That is not exactly true. There were several days when they ran out of hot food by 9:00am and we were left with the cereal and bagels. Not exactly my idea of a hot breakfast.

It is in no way a \" 5 Star Hotel\" in the traditional sense. We ended up at this hotel by chance. It is a long, irrlevelant story but we traveled to Orlando on a whim and did minimal hotel research. We quickly looked online at hotels(--) for the best rates and then based the decision mostly on tripadvisor reviews. This hotel is located about 2 miles from the Disney gates. If you have never been to Disney, it's important to know that the property \"inside the park\" is just huge. Miles and miles. So even if a hotel advertises that they are inside Disney, you can't walk to the parks and still need to take a shuttle or drive. So being 2 miles from Disney is really no big deal. The hotel provides a complimentary shuttle to the parks which we did not use. Within the 2 miles between the hotel and the parks, there are tons of well-known restaurants (Olive Garden, Joe's Crab Shack, Chili's, Bertucci's, Macaroni Grill, Buffalo Wild Wings, Chevy's, Denny's, Shoney's and much much more) so you are not forced to eat inside Disney if you don't want to. (As an aside, the restaurants inside Disney or okay but they usually have very long waits). We preferred eating outside the park so the waits weren't as long and our toddler wouldn't get cranky. The rooms at the Resdence Inn are perfect for famiies. We got upgraded from a standard suite to a family suite and our rate was only $90/night in June. The family suite had a bedroom area with a very comfortable queen bed. It also had a kids bedroom area with two twin beds and a living room are with a pullout couch. Each of the three areas had its own TV (but sometimes when you aimed the remote at one set, it turned on multiple sets, hahah). There is a also a small, full kitchen complete with a microwave, stove, range, dishwasher, plates/silverware and fridge. This is a huge savings for a family. The Winn Dixie is just a mile away so you can stock up on drinks and snacks and you can even cook your own meals if you choose. Another reviewer said they froze bottles of water and brought them to the parks. That was a great tip! I did this and the water stayed cold and lasted most of the day (water at the park is $2/bottle). I also bought those little Crystal Light mixes that go directly into bottled water and froze lemonade and iced tea for the parks too. Our room was a handicapped accessible room so the shower did not have a tub. That made it a little tough to bathe our toddler. So if you have small children you may want to turn down a handicapped accessible room unless they don't mind hopping in a shower. The pool was very nice. It was clean and well maintained. There is a small kiddie pool as well as a jacuzzi. Our room was on the first floor facing the pool so we could hear the kids simming and screaming in the evening which was a little annoying - but, hey, it's orlando and you can't escape the kids. I never saw the pool bar open while I was there which means nothing to me but other reviewers were bothered by that. On to the free breakfast. The quality was decent and there was a very wide assortment. This is a huge cost savings for a family! It's not the typical \"continental breakfast\" that hotels provide. There were eggs, sausage, tortillas, biscuits, bagels, yogurts, muffins, cereals, a mickey mouse waffle maker and much more! You can eat up and then just eat a light lunch at the parks. I also took some snacks for the road like fruit and I filled styrofoam coffee cups with cheerios and fruit loops for my daughter to snack on at the park. I know I probaby wasn't supposed to take food out with me, but oh well.... Other stuff to note: There is one computer in the lobby with free internet access. Free USA Today every day. A concierge that helps with Disney stuff and has lots of info. A game room with some videogames and air hockey for the kids. A machine to rent movies to watch in the room for $5 (the selection was a little weak, but lots of family-friendly stuff). Every evening from 5-6 there were free snacks by the pool. Thursday evening is a free poolside BBQ with burgers, dog, chips, beer, wine etc. but we didn't never made it. Overall, we had a great time and would stay there again.

I was afraid after reading some of the reviews, that things had changed. However the hotel was still wonderful, maybe even better. And the terrific price made it even sweeter. We found the same front desk staff we had last year, and they remembered us, and were very helpful and friendly. We were allowed to check in early without the blink of an eye. Our two, 2 bedroom suites were spotless and well stocked. I mentioned I was a big coffee drinker, and from then on there were three packets of coffee for our pot in our room each day instead of just one. One of the reasons we choose this hotel is that with nine of us traveling together, the breakfast buffet is a real bonus, as well as a time and moneysaver. If you factor that in, our room was even a better deal. The breakfast buffet had 3 kinds of Juice, coffee, tea, milk, herb teas. It had 3 cold cereals and 2 hot...plus granola. There were muffins, danish and breakfast breads, yogurts and fresh fruit...both whole and cut for having with the yogurt. There was a toast station with light and dark bread for toasting, raisen bread, bagels, english muffins and butter, margarine, honey, jams, p-nut butter, etc. They had sausage and bacon everyday, plus scrambled eggs and either hotcakes, french toast or biscuits and gravy. They also had tortillas, cheeses, salsa and croissants. There were 3 Mickey Mouse waffle irons with the batter ready to go, and various syrups and toppings for them. After most of us ate, we would fill a plate to take back to the room for the sleepyheads. One day one of the staff followed me to the elevator to help carry the stuff. There was more than enough choices to keep all 9 of us happy for the 4 days we were there...very good buffet. I often wonder what folks are used to who find this type of spread inadequate. Everything in the room worked, (all 3 TVS, vcr, kitchen appliances, etc) and access to high speed internet was a plus. The beds were oh so comfortable, and we heard no noise from the corridors. We were on the third floor. We enjoyed the pool, with its plentiful fluffy towels and tropical lancscaping, the pool bar and the hotels proximity to Disney. The Jaccuzzi was just the right temp to soothe aching \"Disney feet\", and relax for sleep. The suites had one bedroom with a king, one with 2 queens, and a large living room/ kitchen with a sleeper sofa, which was better then the average one. There were 2 bathrooms in each suite, which were spotless with high end shampoos and conditioners. We had a rental car so didn't use the shuttle to the parks, but the folks in the room next to us said it worked well for them. Each morning our USA today was there to enjoy withour coffee. All in all another great stay.

I'm planning next years vacation and I wanted to check reviews on this hotel since we had stayed here before and I noticed I did not write one for our first stay. So, I thought I would make up for that now. My wife and I and our 5 children stayed here for spring break. The kids range in age from 4-15. We booked our trip through All Guest Services. (I would post their web address but I want this review posted to help others thinking about staying here.) They had an area right in the lobby of the hotel. They took care of everything for us from our hotel reservation to our Disney tickets which were waiting for us at check in. For 5 nights and four days and Four day Disney Park Hopper tickets for seven of us, they saved us almost $1000 versus booking through a travel agent or on our own. We had a two bedroom suite. Our two daughters (15 and 11) took one bedroom. Our son (13) slept on the sleeper sofa and the twins (4) slept in the king size bed with my wife and I. At home they usually sneek into bed with us (queen size) and they take up all the room. In this bed we didn't even know they were near us that's how big the bed was. We had two bathrooms and a full service kitchen. This came in handy as the grocery store was nearby and we could pick up items for dinner or to snack on and not spend all of our money eating out or on vending machines for snacks. The breakfast selection was very good in the morning. A lot of varity. Fruit, cereal, biscuts and gravey, yougurt, danish's, eggs, sausage, pancakes and waffles. The pool area was nice and clean. All of the staff we ran into was excellent. Our housekeeper was the same for the week we were there and she took great care of us. The nicest thing about this hotel was it's location. We were far enough away from the other hotels (at the time, this was the only hotel in this area). But we were close enough to the Disney properties, stores, restaurants and anything else we could need. All of our kids loved the pool. The oldest kids had fun in the game room. My wife and I enjoyed relaxing by the pool with a couple of drinks at the poolside bar while the kids swam after a day running around the Disney parks. All in all, we had a great time and it was an excellent family vacation and the Residence Inn was a big part of that.

We would take two to three rooms and make it a family vacation. Unfortunately this last time we went was not at all what we were used too. When we first came in we were immediately told \"CHECK IN IS AFTER 3PM\". It was 2:45. When we got in our rooms we found out they were not what we had asked for. We need two, two bedroom suites. We got two family suites, (A one bedroom with a bump out with two small beds) and were still being charged for a two bedroom. We called down and they said we were upgraded to this room... this was no upgrade for a two bedroom, it was an upgrade for a one bedroom. Finally we were told we could have the two bedrooms we had reservation for but they said they would not come get out luggage and move us, we would have to come down and get the keys. After than the vacation went down hill regarding this hotel. The breakfast was limited. They would only put out a little bit at a time. The breakfast host yelled at my son when he went up and got seconds on pan cakes. I finally had to go up and get my son's food and she gave me a dirty look. The Front Office manager Orlando (Yes, his name is Orlando) had no response about my complaints. He made excuses about being busy and we should understand because we are a regular. Well we are not regulars anymore. For the Price we paid we could easily stay on Disney rather be treated like dirt. Usually companies treat repeat clients like gold.

I recommend it for groups for the cost and convenience, but if you are a party of three or less you can be overwhelmed by the groups (large ones) at breakfast, in the pool and the lobby. I would prefer a hotel with a mixture of suites and rooms the next time to avoid the crowds. Breakfast was a noisy, messy affair in spite of the hotel staff's best efforts. We ran into too many kids unattended, running around, serving themselves, and basically making a big mess. There is a nice pool which younger kids would like. The staff was VERY nice and helpful. Our room was in a great location (on the street side of the hotel), near the parking lot, and we avoided noise from the pool and from I-4. Try and ask for a quiet room. It was a one bedroom suite with two queen beds and a pull out. Quiet and clean. Some downsides were: the internet didn't work for most of the time we were there, the toaster didn't work, the sheets were not fitted and should be renewed, and the beds were far too soft. We enjoyed the hotel's location, at the end of a strip of hotels, which might seem far for some, but it was quiet.

Don't bother bringing food with you because of what you hear about the increased cost of food, we just didn't find large prices. A few things were higher than what we normallly pay, but not by much. There is a Winn Dixie about 4-5 minutes away. Go ahead and get their customer card and save even more money. Be sure to buy dish soap unless you want to run the dishwasher every day for just a few dishes.
