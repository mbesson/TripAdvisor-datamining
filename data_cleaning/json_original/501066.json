The room had a safe which was free of charge and a handy fridge. Hairdryer in the bathroom. It was hot while we were there and the aircon worked beautifully.

This hotel is close to Retiro Park, but quite a distance to some sights, but I believe there are several buses and the metro you could use if you didn,t want to walk.

However, there is no free wifi at the hotel and the rates they charge for the wifi are incredibly high. When we entered our room on the 3rd floor, however, we were incredibly disappointed. Although the room was relatively large, the decor in the room was incredibly dated. Because of this, we felt very mislead as the room was not representative of how the hotel portrayed the rooms on their website. The curtains were closed when we entered the room, so we decided to open the curtains but it didn't help at all with the level of light in the room. We arrived at 4 o'clock in the afternoon and the light entering our room could have fooled you into it being about 9 o'clock, maybe even later.

While this hotel isn't BAD, it really has nothing else going for it other than good location to this Palacio. I read the reviews and was concerned about rudeness and a shabby room. Actually, it was \"fine.\" There was an older man working the desk in the evenings who didn't go out of his way to be rude, but shouldn't be in the service industry either. However, there was a woman also working at the same time, and she was more approachable, but not extremely friendly either. However, we weren't struck by blatant rudeness. If you want someone sucking up to you all the time, this isn't the place for you. The room was older and dated, but not dirty. Furnishing were shabby, but we weren't looking for pristine accommodations, just something clean, safe, and within walking distance of our concert. We didn't use any of the services other than the business center area for internet service. I believe it was one Euro for ten minutes of internet service. There is a bus from the airport which drops you off about a block from the hotel. The bus costs 2 Euros per person and drops you off at the O'Donnell stop. Make sure you change money before landing at Madrid Airport. We landed in Terminal 1 and spent about 3 hours after deplaning trying to find a currency exchange service.

The travel agent at work booked it, and as soon as we walked in, I knew it was a mistake. It's fairly close to the centre of town, but that doesn't make up for the rest of it's shortcomings. Certainly not a 4 star hotel, I'd have trouble rating it even 2 star, to be honest. The lobby is like Picadilly circus - hundreds of people milling about. It's all part of the convention centre, so there are meeting rooms and coffee bars downstairs, and about 700 rooms upstairs. Even with 5 people manning reception, it still took 30 mins to check in, and staff were unhelpful. The room itself was down about 1/2 a mile of darkish corridors. I walked in to be confronted with a tiny room, comprising a teeny desk, oversized TV and a sofa made up as a single bed. However, my initial outrage was calmed by walking round the corner of the sofa to see another 2 rooms and bathroom, so overall, the size was great, especially if you have kids with you. Bedroom was huge, but looked out onto a main road, so was noisy. I needed those earplugs! Bed was not particularly comfortable, but was big and clean. Bathroom was fine, OK toiletries, good shower. Slightly bizarre set up with the loo and bidet beyond saloon-style doors within the main bathroom, didn't really see the point. Everything VERY dated, especially the soft furnishings. And some of the electricity sockets were frankly dangerous. Desk too small really for any useful work. And then we come to my main complaint. Despite advertising itself as a business hotel, this place is anything but. The wireless internet costs extra. And DO NOT PAY FOR IT IN ADVANCE as it doesn't work properly. The signal kept disconnecting and reconnecting, every few seconds or minutes. If you're looking at hotmail, you might not notice, as the page would just seem slow. But if you need to do any type of file transfer or access virtual desktops, it's utterly pointless as you keep getting logged out. I phoned reception 3 times. No help there. Completely uninterested. Kept putting me through to the wireless internet manager, who was never there. I went down to reception to complain in person. Still not interested. In the morning, they had the cheek to ask me to pay for it, even though there was a note that it hadn't worked. I refused to pay, which started a full-blown argument at the cashiers desk. They had the cheek to tell me that it was my fault I had no signal, because basically girls don't understand computers. As someone who sets up (functional) computer systems on a daily basis, I rather took exception to this comment. The result was eventually that the manager was called, and he agreed that I didn't need to pay. But by this point I was absolutely fuming. And my mood was not helped by the taxi situation. The desk staff will not call cabs, there's a porter outside who basically tries to flag them down. But the road the hotel is situated on is not a good one for catching cabs, they are all full by the time they go past. After standing fruitlessly in the rain for 10 mins, watching him gesture half-heartedly at a selection of occupied cabs, along with 50 other people wanting taxis, we walked about 5 mins down the road towards the hospital and caught a cab from there. Not ideal with loads of luggage, but otherwise we'd have been waiting all day.

The tour company changed the hotel at the last minute from the Florida Norte because clients on the last tour experienced food poisoning there, and we were glad because Trip Advisor subscribers also condemned it. At the Convencion we experienced a very smooth check-in and the rooms on the 4th Floor were large, clean and comfortable. Some rooms may be noisier than others but that's the luck of the draw in big city hotels and ours was fine. The hotel has two separate dining rooms and as we were on a budget tour we had the canteen version for a continental breakfast - adequate but basic and plentiful - you get what you pay for so can't complain. Buffet breakfasts in big hotels can always be a bit of a battlefield - it's part of the fun -- but I expect a number of folk would disagree? We ate one evening meal in the main hotel restaurant, and that was very good with excellent service - but expensive. In a typical commercial hotel with 700+ rooms you have to expect some disruption and a busy reception area, but despite one night when Real Madrid were beaten by Roma to the delight of a group of exuberant Italian students even they were well behaved. There were no complaints from our coach party. We would recommend this hotel as a reasonable place to stay for a brief trip to this lovely city. Also, the hotel is surely just to sleep overnight between the sightseeing musts that Madrid has to offer, and it is in a good location for that. My worst experience was trying to watch CNN for basic news bulletins. It is awful in comparison with all three British news channels of Sky, BBC and ITV, and the reception was poor.

That did not bother us since we fitted perfectly into the second category ; but what was clearly unacceptable was the noise penetrating into our room at night, coming from all kinds of obvious and other more mysterious sources.
