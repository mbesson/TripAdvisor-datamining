The room was spacious and the entry was not off the main hallway. It seemed that pairs of rooms had separate foyers which kept hallway noise to a minimum. The view was of the city but not an incredibly desirable one. The balcony was tiny (only big enough to stand on, with your stomach held in) but it was winter so we didn't spend any time out there.

It also had a separate walk in robe/dressing area, a two bowled vanity basin and separate bathroom containing the toilet and shower.

Fourth, I was upset by the lack of recycling in the hotel. There were no recycling bins in the rooms or even the business center. Fifth, I wasn't a huge fan of the decor/style (but I realize that's a personal thing).

As it is not part of a chain, the property has its own website, but often does not appear in lists of hotels in downtown San Diego where it is located. Nor is it particularly visible from the street, where the entrance is recessed inside an arcade-like entrance, almost hidden by large urns of tropical plants. Given that the building, built in the 70s, has 19 stories of rooms, a large underground parking garage, a main-level floor of shops, and a second-floor ballroom, this is all the more unsusal. The hotel is unique in other ways as well. Modeled after an anti-room in the Palace of Versailles, the lobby and adjoining rooms are decorated in a resplendent fashion reminiscent of the great halls of Europe: giant chandeliers, antique furniture uphostered with period tapestries, chinoiserie, grand mirrors and paintings...and huge displays for fresh-cut flowers arranged in over-sized bowls, urns and vases. Even more remarkable, there is no signage whatsoever: no post-card racks, no magazines, no tourist displays--indeed, nothing that would indicate that his is a hotel in a busy urban locale. Check-in was fast, polite and professional. When I explained that I hoped for plenty of sunlight in my room, the young woman at the desk quietly up-graded me to a higher floor where she assured me there was lots of light and a view as well. Indeed, the room was lovely, once the bell-man ushered me through the small anti-chamber that disquised its entrance. He had appeared curbside when my taxi arrived from the airport, and had spirited my luggage to the row of elevators in the looby where he waited until I had received my key. After showing me around my spacious room, opening the heavy drapes to reveal the stunning view, he disappeared as unobtrusively as he a materialized--all the more astonishing given than he looked like a Thirties moviestar. The room was large, with pale striped wallpaper, brocade drapery, reproduction Louis X1V furniture, fine bedding, and no artwork other than a gilded mirror. The bathroom, which consisted of two rooms, along with a large closet, almost formed its own \"wing,\" with a long vanity and stool in front of the room-wide mirror. The WC included a sit-down shower large enough for two. The Gilchrist and Soames toiletries were in bottles twice the size of most hotel amenities, and they were replenished daily. The hotel's turn-down service is excellent--which I found surprising, given that I don't particularly appreciate the ritual. My first night there, I went to bed early, and missed it. My second night, I came home to find the lights in the room dimmed, environmental sounds playing from the radio, the heavy damask quilt and throw pillows removed from the bed and piled neatly on a stool that must have been hidden in the closet, the bed \"remade\" with down duvet and three sheets, and two discreet chocolates adorning a breakfast menu on the coverlet. The effect was peaceful and relaxing, and most appreciated after a hectic day. I have never stayed in hotel (and I have stayed in many) where I felt both valued and ignored...in just the right ways. From the moment I arrived, I felt so welcome that I considered myself priveleged; yet, simultaneoulsly, no one approached me during my stay, or interupted me when I worked in my room on the wireless internet, as I did two afternoons Housekeeping was immaculate, but invisible. On the one day when I stayed in all day to work, the head of housekeeping phoned me late in the afternoon to ask if I wanted my room cleaned, and to avail myself of the turn-down service. Somehow, she knew that I had been in my room all day, and had left me alone until she felt obliged to enquire about my wishes. My wish is to be able to stay here again. The dining-room is one of the loveliest I have seen. The food, judging by the two breakfasts I enjoyed there, was original and delicious, the service, once again, impeccable. The small bar is elegant yet intimate...which perhaps summarizes my experience of the whole hotel, where I stayed for one week. How a property of this size manages to run a complicated facility with such attention to detail amazes me...and makes it very rare in my experience of American hotels. And I paid less than I would have if I had booked a Holiday Inn. Go figure. My only quibble about my experience is entirely personal. The Saturday night that I visited the bar to listen to live music, almost everyone there was dressed in gowns and tuxedos ... attending the opera, no doubt, which is near-by, or the wedding reception that was being held on the third floor. These patrons all looked appropriately dressed for their surroundings. In my jeans and sweater, I felt so out-of-place that I left which, no doubt, was unecessary. But I wish I had brought some fancy clothes--which I will do next time I visit.

Bed was firm and comfortable, shower pressure was awesome, lovely bathroom area, mini-fridge handy, and room quiet. Any staff we spoke to were pleasant, and the room was nicely cleaned and decorated (not our normal taste, but lavish style in keeping with the hotel's theme and fun for a change), with chocolates delivered in the early evening. Yes, we heard some low-level city noise, but, well, it's in the middle of the city, so....no trouble for us. No view from our room, but we were out too much to worry about that. Big perk: We arrived early in the day and were allowed early check-in by helpful front desk / concierge--- much appreciated (and not expected)! We did not use room service, but the prices seemed quite reasonable. We saw some guests enjoying an afternoon tea complete with harpist. I was originally not going to recommend this hotel because of the $15 daily resort fees. I am not clear what these fees paid for, exactly.... We were told this covered things like the spa, coffee, wifi, etc.--- yet most of these are normally included in the regular daily rate of hotels 2 star and up (in my experience). I didn't see a particularly luxurious spa area (correct me if I am wrong...) that could justify the fee. Coffee in room was barely passable with normal artificial creamers, etc., although herbal tea was nice touch. It would be better, in my opinion, just to inflate the daily rate so guests were clear from the onset what they were paying per day. Alternatively, the hotel could add more to justify this fee. (I'm not certain if this resort fee applies to all hotel guests or just those who had reduced rates - we booked through Hotwire..) We likely would not return as we do like a pool/jacuzzi area, and I don't understand what the $15 fee per day pays for. It reads as a bit of a cash grab...

There were several cars stopped at the main street entrance (and no valet or or concierge in sight) so we had to stop the car a bit further from the hotel to unload our luggage. Then we had to look for parking. On the night that we arrived, there was a wedding at the hotel so we had to drive around several times to find a parking space. Hotel parking is costly at $32 (not the most expensive parking that I have ever paid), but there is street parking -- IF you can find a spot, and IF you are comfortable walking back to the hotel on sidewalks that are occupied by the homeless. On top of that, the hotel charges a $15 resort fee for conveniences that are offered for free in many hotels such as Internet access and water. And there are only so many calls that I can make a day -- certainly not $15 worth. Now for the positives -- the room was clean and the front desk staff were very helpful.

There are some stains on the carpet, but it was dry and no odor, just for 1 night, i didn't really care. the bed was ok, but the pillow was too soft for my taste. Our room has a tube TV not a flat screen TV. The bathroom was very interesting. Marble wall and floor, square tub, a nice shower with great water pressure. The hotel shampoo and soap were nice and very flowery. We opt out the turndown service by placing the privacy card outside our door. Yes, there is a $15 + tax = $16.88, charge per day for internet, bottle water and gym. We park our car on the street so we did not have to pay extra $32 for valet.

Naturally, we are quite specific when making reservations in that we require a fully accessible ADA room with roll in shower. When we arrived, they had put us in a regular room. The bellhop commented on this before we did, and went back to the lobby himself and returned with the hotel manager who apologized profusely. We were informed that the only fully accessible rooms they had available were designed for 2 people (we were 4), and he offered us an executive suite on the 18th floor with a bay view as his best option for us. The executive suite was not ADA, but was roomy, and as we were there for just one night, we felt this was a reasonable accommodation, and at least reflected some concern on behalf of the staff. From the inside, the hotel appears to have been built 100 years ago, but I was told by the manager that it was built in the 1970's.

I attended a two-day class at the hotel... the elevator commute was fantastic!! I booked an early flight from Denver to San Diego with the intention of spending the day in LA. We arrived at the hotel around 9:30 am and I requested an early check-in. The woman at the front desk was most accommodating and checked us in right away. I'm an Expedia Elite Plus member and this was already noted in my hotel record; so, we received a room upgrade to the 11th floor (Rm #1188). The room is situated along 3rd Avenue facing The U.S. Grant Hotel; an OK city view with one king bed. I don't find San Diego to have a spectacular city view, so a bay view room may be better (it was not available). The room was quiet at night, not much street noise; basically because we were on a higher floor. The light beaming through the sides and bottom of the door to the room wasn't too distracting. It served as a night light of sorts to help navigate my way to the bathroom. (^_^) Maid service was good, as it should be... our class broke for lunch at 11:15 and when I returned to our room on both days, the room and bathroom were spotless. The only thing that was a bit disconcerting (as mentioned by a previous reviewer), is that the maid will knock, then immediately start to open the door. This happened during the day and again at night. One night, around 9:30 PM , the maid knocked on the door to inquire if we liked our turn-down service. Uh, yes... thank you... good night!! The other thing that didn't make sense was having the Afternoon Tea right in the middle of the main entrance lobby of the hotel... As I was heading to the Business Center from the elevator, I had to negotiate tables which was a bit distracting to the diners to say the least. And I had to move through the tables again to leave the Business Center and exit through the front door. Not a well thought-out plan for the flow of traffic for both dining guests or hotel guests. Although I was prepared for the $32/night valet parking and the $15/day resort fees; the parking fee is still pretty exorbitant. I know the GM will say that is standard for San Diego; however, I would expect the valets then to be present 24 hours a day. On Thursday night after returning from dinner, a valet was not outside, so my husband actually parked the car himself (which surprised the valets in the lower level [LL] of the hotel when he pulled in)!! After that, we just parked the car in the LL ourselves. I liked the convenience of printing our boarding passes from the Business Center. The copies go to a printer at the Front Desk, then are delivered to your room. Instead of waiting, I went right to the Front Desk to pick the copies up myself. The hotel is right across from Horton Plaza (the mall hasn't changed much since 1999) and within walking distance of several restaurants in the Gaslamp District. Dinner suggestions: Gladstone's (PCH1 and Sunset Blvd), Vigilucci's La Jolla, and Cafe Sevilla in the Gas Lamp District.

Traveled with 2 young kids. Priceline booking-great rate ($90) just before Comic-Con. Amazing location. Be ready for extra $15++ for 'facilities fee' and don't complain - be prepared for it. But, for a large city, downtown hotel, wired & wireless plus water plus newspaper - the amount is not bad when you are paying a low room rate - many hotels charge this for just Internet. Also, if you have a car, expect to pay $30+ per night. However, many ways around it with minimal hassle. I used street parking the entire visit and spent less than $15 for a five day visit (incl weekend). The decor is truly Europe. Very tastefully done, would not decorate my home that way, but very nice. Rooms were very large, great bathroom with good shower/sink pressure, counter space, closet space, drawer space. Booked on Priceline since Comic-Con made room availability very sparse (and expensive). Got a great rate. After booking, I called hotel directly and placed a request for high floor and double beds, and informed we'd be arriving early and requested an early check-in.Front desk did not promise anything, but included the details as a request and mentioned nothing about extra fees. We checked in on a Friday. Arrived at 11:00am. Was promptly informed the room was not available and a double bed was not a high probability. Stated the contracted room via Priceline is a King Bed only. We traveled to San Diego mainly for the kids. We were busy almost the entire day leaving early and returning after dinner time. So, \"staying\" in the room was not our plan. We knew there was no pool (big negative), but we would not have had time to use it if there had been one. So, keep this in mind for this entire review. We jetted off with good recommendations from the lovely Indian concierge woman (already forgot her name - sorry). We returned to the hotel after 4 PM and the room was ready. The Front Desk CAME THROUGH BIG TIME!! Gave us a room on the 16th floor - not facing much of a view, but no problem. Gave us a room with 2 double beds. Made it a point to inform we with a Priceline booking, the hotel was not obliged to give this type of room without any extra fees. We did not argue and we did not 'fight' for this when we checked in. We were calm and accommodating, and I think this helped tremendously. I parked on the street with a coin operated meter for 2-hr parking. Once Fri at 6 PM hit, parking was free until 8 am. Returned at 8 AM to add coins until we were ready to leave for the day's activities. Street parking is all around (best is off 3rd near A, or B, or Ash streets). Pay no attention to the many homeless who line the streets starting around 7 or 8PM. They were not aggressive in any way, nor loud, nor beggars. The car was parked in street parking the entire stay and never had any problem with damage of any kind. Be sure to read all meter signs for times and days and restrictions. Have lots of quarters ready or visit the 7-Eleven or Front desk to get your change. Yes - an added 'hassle', but to avoid any downtown hotel $30+/day parking, it was well worth the effort. Parking was never more than a 2 to 4 short blocks walk from the hotel (often with less time than the valet to bring it out front). Once Saturday at 6 PM hits, no parking meter fees required until Monday at 8 AM. Add change in the AM and take off for the day, return after 6pm and no fees again. Negatives... * No pool * No real \"action\" inside the hotel (restaurant) * Concierge not 'full-time', sometimes would have to wait for front desk staff Positives... * Great Priceline rate * Great Granny Smith apples all day long * Great cookies in the evening (Choco-chip/ Macadamia Nut) * Great location (downtown/ Gaslamp) * Great housekeeping response * Turndown service dark chocolates :<) Must note** - anything we asked for, they delivered (extra towels, shampoo, water) and quickly and with a smile and with courtesy. Loved the proximity to almost everything (freeway close, Gaslamp Quarter restaurants/ bars galore, central to everything. San Diego is spread out, so no matter what/ where you do, you need to drive some distance - might as well be central. Close to airport. Rent your car from Enterprise (off airport location at W Palm St), use the airport Alamo Rent-a-Car shuttle and walk literally across the street to Enterprise - don't tell them how you got there. Then, use the \"We'll Pick you up service\" for the return ride to the airport. All in all, with many similar circumstances, would stay at Westgate again and recommend it. My wife - who was a huge pessimist before even getting to the hotel - was extremely pleased and wished we had been able to stay here for the entire duration (had Comic-Con not messed things up for us) - poor planning on our part.

I said those were amenities that were free in most other hotels and I thought the fee was just the hotel's attempt to recover some of the priceline losses and I wouldn't pay it or signt he agreement to pay it. The hotel manager was polite and professional, and waived the fee for two nights of our stay, but it soured the experience for me entirely. The hotel was nice enough, but they didn't replace the water in the room, the guests next door to us left dirty diapers all over the hallway, the bathroom was tiny and there were no drawers for clothes, there were several other charges and inconveniences that were not major but nonethless irritating.

Location was good and we were able to get to the harbor, restaurants (Roys in the Marriott was very good) near the convention center, and Gaslamp all by walking 10-20 mins. Cabs would have been just $5-$10 to most places. Bus to Zoo was very convenient, just a short minute walk across the main street. Beware there are homeless people just about every block but we didn't find them bothersome. We got a room on the 14th floor. The entrance to the rooms are quite odd to me. Two rooms share a main French door entrance. Once you open that with the key, you come into a small foyer, then access your room on the left or the right once again using your key. The advantage is that hall noise is reduced but then if your \"neighbor\" slams his/her door, you hear that too. The room size was very generous. The bed was a bit firmer than typical hotel beds but that was to my liking. The pillows are way too soft. I had to double up on them. There were two comfy sofa chairs which we sat in to read the paper. There was another wooden padded chair in the room which we didn't use. The bench at the foot of the bed was nice for putting on / rempoving shoes. The bathroom was also huge. One sink, large vanity with chair for the lady, plus even more counterspace. There is a separate room for the toilet and the shower/tub. It is a square shaped shower/tub with swinging glass door. The built-in seat was nice to sit down to shave. The toiletries were also of high quality. The lotion was one of the most moisturizing I've experienced of hotel lotions. Unfortunately, our room had the tube-style TV and images appeared quite small if watching from the bed. The in-room coffee was a generic brand. The 2 bottles of water per day was nice to take along with us on outings. The fridge chilled things placed in it, but never really made anything cold. Turn-down service was a very nice touch. My husband found the European style furnishings to be a turn-off partly because they appeared out of date, but I didn't really care. I did appreciate that at least everything coordinated. While checking out, they attempted to charge for parking, though we didn't have a car. They apologized and said they would take that off the bill leaving us with a zero balance (we pre-paid on Expedia). Now that I am home though, I see a charge for one day of parking on my credit card activity so I will be calling them. Overall the stay was good and I'd come back if I were visiting again. By the way, my husband and I love breakfast so we'd like to suggest Cafe 222 (peanut butter and banana french toast is a special) and Broken Yolk to visitors. They were probably a 20 min walk.

However, almost everything about it is old. Not old in a bad or decrepit way, just - nostalgic. Having traveled extensively for several decades, I would describe the Westgate as an almost perfect replica of five star travel circa 1985. Right down to the old-school push button phones, tube televisions, safes that work with a magnetic stripe card (check out our latest technology!) and heavy gold bathroom hardware. Again, the amenities aren't bad, just ancient. It was like sleeping in a museum of hotel history.\u00a0 Otherwise, the Westgate is a fine if unremarkable hotel for business travel. The service was quite accommodating and courteous, rooms are huge by today's standards, and there wasn't really anything to complain about during my stay. Room service could have been a little more prompt, but the housekeeping was fantastic. Proper evening turndown is a rarity at most properties these days, but here again the Westgate kicks it old school.\u00a0 If you're gunning for LCD televisions, peekaboo showers, and sleek dark wood office furniture, look elsewhere.

If you go in already knowing about the daily facility charge ($15per day) and valet ($32 per day), you will not be disappointed. We were very happy with our stay this past weekend. My friend and I had an early check in to the Westgate early this past Friday for a fun relaxing weekend in San Diego. ( I live in SD but was enjoying a Girls weekend sans kids)We wanted to get settle into the hotel before heading up to La Jolla for dinner and sightseeing and there was no problems with checking in at 11:45am. It was quick and easy with little wait. (just the way I like it!) The lobby was decorated in an old world European charm which we enjoyed. Although for others, it might not be their cup of tea. Our room was on the the 10th floor facing the harbor....really wished the NBC building was not in the way of the beautiful view. The room was very well appointed, spacious (probably b/c the double beds were full size instead of queen), with flat screen TV (which we didn't turn on with the exception when the maid turn it on for music during turndown--nice ambiance touch upon our return to our room.), water pressure was excellent---almost felt like getting a good massage which my girlfriend agreed), clean (most important to us), and simply decorated. We never once saw another guest on our floor which was nice and quiet. The noise level can be high from passerby in the gas lamp district. It didn't bother us as it just sound like white noise. However, it you have a lower level room, I can see that it might be disturbing. The facility charge included water bottles, wifi, and usage of the fitness center( which we used on one morning only--nice & standard). For a weekend pleasure trip where you have no need for the business center & wi-fi, the additional fee may add up. However, for the business traveler, it's convenient and an acceptable fee. In terms of location, it's very conveniently located. You can hop across the street and shop til you drop at Horton PLaza where there are plenty of eateries, movie theatre, CVS etc... You are only foot steps to the Gas Lamp Quarters, too. Valet service was very efficient---I usually telephone the reception desk for our car---and each time we arrived at the garage, our car was there waiting for us. It's definitely worth the $32. (although management should consider lowering the fee to $25) We had a brief tour of the Sunday Brunch and didn't have time to partake. However, we would love to come back to experience Sunday brunch in the future. It looked absolutely devine with everything plated so exquisitely. The chocolate fountain would be a sight of heaven for my 5 yo chocoholic daughter if she was there. Overall, we had a wonderful stay at the Westgate. It's not the Four Seasons Lanai' (where we were greeted daily by all staff by our surname) by any means but satisfactory for Downtown San Diego.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chandler, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, but rather expensive\u201d", "Author": "aspataro", "ReviewID": "UR113210338", "Content": "So my wife and I took a trip to San Diego for Memorial Day weekend.

My overall impression is that if you plan on using Priceline don't expect too much savings when your staying in downtown San Diego because parking is always going to be expensive.

Now, the BAD!!! -Over-priced parking (about $30 nightly) -No coffee-maker in room (free coffee is in lounge) -Mini-safe has to be purchased to be used. -2nd night of my 3-night stay was completely sleepless and scary, as a group of completely drunk \"soccer riot\" types blasted into their rooms next to us screaming at 11 pm, then left. They then returned in the midst of a FORTY MINUTE free-for-all physical fight at 3 a.m. People being thrown against walls, language that would make Bobby Knight blush and apologize,...you get the idea!!

Gorgeous harbor views, etc. Further, they gave us 2 free unlimited room service breakfasts (priced at about $25 EACH), moved our luggage for us,....and fined the losers in the room next to us $250 for the disturbance and damage done to the room by smoking in it!!

I didn't expect my room to be ready but went to the hotel anyway (can't walk around town with luggage). Met by a bell hop who took my luggage to the front desk. They checked and discovered not to my surprise that they didn't have mt room available, the very pleasant woman on the front desk suggest I leave my luggage, and call back around lunch time and they should be able to get me in.

There are ample elevators resulting in Little waiting to get to or from your room. My room was on the 5th floor, it was very nice. Once off the elevator, you are greeted by a set of double doors that lead to two rooms, one of which was mine. An electronic key grants access to the hallway and your room. My room was very large, a french balcony offered a somewhat limited view of downtown. The room was well equipped with TV (older tube type, not a flat screen) DVD player, clock radio with ipod dock, desk, chair and bed. It also had at least 3 phones, one next to the bed on a night table, a second on the desk and a third next to the sink. The hotel offer free wifi access as well. Off the main bedroom was a large bathroom area containing a lengthy vanity, and sink along with nice bath products, creams, shampoos and soap. Off of that room was a walk in closet, with double doors, and a sliding door led to an inner bathroom with toilet facilities and a large shower/bath combination. The room was very clean, but slightly dated by worn carpet. The room was cleaned in the morning, and in the evening there was a turn-down service, where the comfort and extra pillows were stored, chocolate left on the pillow, and a personalized forecast was left on the night stand, free bottle water and ice was also supplied at this time. The hotel made me feel special, I had planned to attend high tea, but didn't feel that my attire suited the occasion, young women were there in the bright colourful dresses and flowery hats. The hotel is very classy. As I had already mentioned the carpet was worn, the only other downside was street noise. San Diego has a busy railway downtown and the noise can be disturbing. As in many big cities, sirens can be heard much of the night, a fire station is just a little over a block away. Also there was a protest one morning across the street that woke me. THe rooms are not well insulated for sound from the outside, but given the quality of this hotel, these are minor issues.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville", "Title": "\u201cElegant but be cautious\u201d", "Author": "jaxeyemd", "ReviewID": "UR103217574", "Content": "Elegant hotel however I had a handicapped accessible room and the hotel staff actually entered my room while I was sleeping to leave a large envelope on my desk.

Since there were no handicap accessible rooms that allowed a guest to lock themselves in the room from the inside (ie no bolt inside) I switched to a traditional room for the added security and had to give up the handicap benefits I needed. The hotel itself is elegant, staff are very pleasant but be very cautious about locking yourself in as apparently some new employees are not aware that they should not enter. Its a very formal hotel, one of the most expensive by history in San DIego, the ambience is beautiful although definitely a bit uncomfortable in the dining room, wait staff less than friendly. Still the front desk staff makes up for this and if you are looking for a European style hotel near things to do (ie Fifth Street, heart of San Diego downtown) this is a very reasonable place and I did get a great rate on Priceline.

We were very pleased when we got a room at the Westgate! However, after we parked our car at the valet and made our way to checkin, we were informed that we did not, in fact, have a room at the Westgate. Despite reserving over a month in advance, our room had been 'overbooked.' They had arranged a room for us nearby at the Westin (which they said is the same star rating as the Westgate, and by the way, they have a pool and jacuzzi which is more than the Westgate has to offer, so we should be happy for the change!), and they were happy to have a bellman walk our bags over if we wanted to leave our car at the Westgate (and pay full price parking for leaving it there). I asked to speak to the manager who said that there was a problem with the way they had received bookings from Priceline, so it was not their fault. I could be assured that this had happened only once in the past 1.5 years, and that it would not happen again. I asked if there was anything they could do for me, but she only reiterated that it was not the hotel's fault that we could not have the room we had been promised, and that, again, the Westin was better given the pool that they have, and apparently we should be happy for the change. Needless to say, we were very disappointed. We had a guaranteed reservation which was not honored, and in spite of multiple inquiries for any semblance of compensation, we got nothing other than the offer to leave our car at the hotel that kicked us out. We would have appreciated at least a waiver for parking, or a discount on our next stay, but no. In spite of asking multiple times, the message was, basically, leave. In short, if you stay at the Westgate, hopefully you pay a lot for your room, otherwise be prepared to be treated like yesterday's garbage.", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWonderful under rated hotel\u201d", "Author": "alexanderten", "ReviewID": "UR102587794", "Content": "I loved the Westgate.

The dressing room and bath were equally luxurious with ample mirrors, amenities, and a roomy tub/shower combo. Additional perks were the free Wifi throughout and complimentary morning coffee in the Plaza Bar downstairs, both much appreciated.

The hotel's location is superb, right at the corner of the Gaslamp area and right across the street from the very nice outdoor Horton Center shopping center. There are probably 100+ restaurants within a few blocks, many of which have amazing happy hour deals on both drinks and appetizers (we tried several). The hotel is elegantly decorated, maybe a bit over the top like pseudo-European Versailles, but it worked. Staff are ultra-professional, uniformed, and friendly. We felt pampered. The hotel itself is really quiet and there's not much hustle and bustle. The only downside is that it's on Broadway, and even 14 floors up, the hooting and hollering and sirens until nearly dawn on Sunday morning might bother very light sleepers (maybe ask for a room on the other side, but you'll miss an amazing view of downtown and the bay). Rooms are very large, very nicely decorated, and with really large and elegant bathrooms (marble tile, big vanity with cushioned stool, oversized tub, big towels, bathrobes, etc.) Previous comments mention shower temperature and pressure, but both were amazing. The bed was really nice, although a notch below the heavily marketed fancy beds of some of the hotel chains. Our room looked exactly like the picture on the website. Loved the balcony! Big plus: the hotel has free wireless Internet and the speed was excellent. Bravo! The fitness center was very well equipped, but despite the marketing, there really isn't a spa, just a treatment room apparently available only if you book a treatment ahead of time. There's no pool. The dining room and bar seemed dead all the time (not a single guest in the dining room early Saturday evening), but afternoon tea looked like a lot of fun and it was pretty booked up. The concierge was very helpful, but not there all the time. You just get the feeling that not much happens at the hotel, which is a shame because it has so much going for it. On the other hand, you can get a good deal and enjoy a quiet and relaxing visit. This was a great stay.

We got a great rate and we were very happy with this hotel. We arrived around 5 PM on Saturday night and we weren't able to find any valets in front of the hotel and when we continued up 2nd Ave a little bit we saw a couple well dressed gentlemen sending people away and saw signs that the parking lot was full. Not a great way to arrive but we circled the block a few times and eventually found street parking a few blocks away. The ease of parking leaves a little bit to be desired but when we got back to the hotel we saw that a wedding was scheduled at 5 and there were a lot of people to park so we gave the hotel somewhat of a pass on that but at that point we were a little nervous about our hotel selection. We walked in to the lobby and immediately the room and the chandeliers gave us a flashback of the Hall of Mirrors from our trip to Versailles last year. The setting is very elegant and classy and I liked it but was kind of sad that my mom wasn't with us because she would have LOVED it. It is definitely a unique hotel in that aspect. We were able to check in quickly and when we got to the room I had a little trouble with the key (an actual key, the first I've seen at a hotel in years but with an interesting design) but after a few tries we were able to get in our room which was very generously sized. We were on the 6th floor and had a view towards the Gaslamp district and the bay which we liked. The glass door opens to a small balcony where you can step out and enjoy the weather, which was a perfect 75 degrees the day we were there. We had a king size bed which was very comfortable and the furnishings continued the French theme from the downstairs lobby. The bathroom was very large and had a vanity area, a large mirror that my wife loved, a closet, and a separate shower/toilet area. One of our only complaints about the room is that the drain in the shower was slow and the water tended to back up rather quickly. I guess our only other complaint is that the tube TV could use an update but not that big a deal. The entertainment center had a DVD player which we found rather fortunate since we had just bought a movie and we were able to watch it that night at the hotel. We didn't have any meals at the hotel but we were close enough to walk to Ruth's Chris for dinner and then The Broken Yolk the next morning for brunch. The hotel is in a very centralized location close to a lot of restaurants, bars, and a Westfield Mall. The area can get somewhat sketchy after dark and I wouldn't venture out north of Broadway. There were a few panhandlers asking us for change out in front of a 7-11 next door but it's the type of thing you'll see downtown in any large city.

Decorated in a classy 1920\u2019s French provincial motif, it is a great reminder the old style, elegance and excesses of the wealthy from a segment of society that is seldom seen. Upon entering, patrons are sucked into a massive and yet sparsely furnished lobby area. Suspended from 20+ foot ceiling are at least 6 large chandeliers (the size of a small car) and each is ornately trimmed; all seemingly to leave you wondering what would happen if they were to fall. Overall, the lobby is very impressive, but is more designed to show off the large collection antiques and therefore had more the appearance of a museum. The lack of coziness made it difficult to carry on a conversation with anyone in the lobby. This was because the furniture was so spread out and if there was any activity in the background, the noises echoed and added to the problem. However, a real good hearing aid or maybe a bullhorn could easily solve this problem. There is a nice internet room with two computers a fireplace and a few sofas. Afternoon tea was impressive with plenty of snacks and a touch of elegance (for a price). The staff bent over backwards to help in every way possible and the people at the front desk were especially helpful and had plenty of information. The guest rooms were also decorated on a grand scale - My room had a very comfortable bed and clean linens and a constant supply of fresh towels and a fresh bathrobe on top of it. Nightly turn down service with chocolates on your pillow adds to the experience. A large television, large bed, two chairs and spacious shower made for a room that you could truly spread out in. There is a workout room in the basement, but no swimming pool. The hotel also lacks a gift shop, but within three blocks there is plenty of shopping. If you like ice in your drink, be sure to keep a supply of dollar bills on hand because the only ice machine is somewhere in the kitchen so a member of the staff will have to bring it to your room in exchange for a tip.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in down town San Diego\u201d", "Author": "chicagolouis", "ReviewID": "UR80614898", "Content": "I was at a conference at the Marriot Marina, but stayed at the Westgate.

There is no denying that it is a beautiful hotel and I encountered a very friendly staff. While most of my activities were located in another part of downtown and the hotel's location was not totally convenient for me, fortunately, I do love to walk and built walking time into my day. My first complaint is the ice situation. Unlike most hotels, if ice is needed, a call to room service is necessary. I was promised ice in 15 minutes. 30 minutes later, it did not show up. Another call was placed and it was promptly delivered. Ice is not free either as I believe it is customary to tip room service delivery. Remember to build time into your day for ice. My main complaint is the room design. I was looking forward to a weekend of rest but two nights out of three were interrupted from noise from the room I shared an entry with. While the entry ways adequately block noise from the hallways, you are at the mercy of your neighbors as far as noise is concerned. During the first night, I was awakened by the sound of my neighbors checking out of their room at 3:30 a.m. Luggage banging and conversation made it sound like they were ready to enter my room. It really is like sharing an apartment with someone and having adjoining bedrooms. The next morning I was moved to a larger room with two beds. The room next to me was already occupied and I could hear a toddler cry. I should have asked for another room but I was willing to try my luck and did not want to appear to be a crank. Out of exhaustion, I slept well the next night but the third night was another story as I was awakened at 3:30 by the shrieking, crying toddler. An hour later I fell asleep only to be awakened at 6:45 a.m. by the toddler and the shrieking, crying onslaught had no end. By 7:30 I decided to get up, pack my bags, and head home . . . I could no longer take it. So please be forewarned about the thin walls of these rooms and be respectful of your neighbors if you do decide to visit.", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cTop spot in Downtown San Diego\u201d", "Author": "Crossbill", "ReviewID": "UR77678838", "Content": "We had one night here as a base for Seaworld - we got the room at a discount through Priceline.

The service I experienced was first class, everyone was not only friendly and helpful, but professional and classy. I enjoyed being treated like I truly was important. Some people might complain about the parking, it is $28 a day for valet parking, which is the only option. But most other hotels I looked at charged at least $20, and it was nice to pay a little extra and once again feel like a big shot with the valet taking my car for me, then delivering my bags to the room, great experience. The room was large and nice. It is a little weird how you enter in through a double door into a small entry way you share with another room, then you enter your room. But this little oddity does give more privacy and it helps keep the sound level from the elevators and hallway to a minimum. We had a King bed, which was comfortable and the room had two arm chairs and a desk. The bathroom was large and nicely appointed with a large shower. The room seems a little empty though because it is large and the old TV cabinet with old tube TV are a little funny to see, but this is not the type of hotel I would expect to see fancy high tech items in. Everything I needed was there including all necessary soaps and shampoos as well as a hair dryer and curling iron. The room also had a large double sliding door that opened to a small balcony, a nice touch. Finally, the room was very quite, and while the bed was not as comfortable as my memory foam bed at home, it was decent if a little firm. The location is good, a short two block walk to the start of the Gaslamp district, the walk seems a little sketchy at night, but in all reality I never felt unsafe. Also, once you get to the Gaslamp district their a plenty of bike taxi's that could take you back to the hotel, an especially good idea of you are having difficulty walking from all the delicious food and drink available in the Gaslamp district. Another note, the Yard House is one block away from the hotel and it has excellent happy hour offerings and a gargantuan selection of beer on tap. Finally, while I did not use the train service it should be noted that the train runs right past the back side of the hotel, so I am assuming that there is easy access to this transportation method as well. Amenities, I did not see any that interested me and I did not use any of the hotel services, although I noticed they did have a fitness center, small restaurant and most interestingly an old fashioned barber shop complete with red and white striped pole. But in all reality with the Gaslamp district so close and some many unique and wonderful restaurants to chose from why would I over pay for something at the hotel. In the end the quality of this stay comes down to the great price I received from hotwire. I paid $79 for this hotel, which after taxes paying for valet and tipping my one evening stay in the middle of the week cost $130. In my opinion this was a great price to experience a new hotel that had a unique atmosphere. Everything was clean and service was good, I do not think I could get anything better for the price. However, the rack rate of $180 per evening plus tax, tip and parking would have left me ticked off. I would say for a unique getaway and a place close to the Gaslamp this is a good choice, but I would not pay much more than $80-$90 a night plus taxes etc. I hope that helps your decision making.

The front desk was ready for us the minute we came into the hotel and we were checked in least than 10 minutes. The rooms had two doors to separate the noise from the outside hallway which were perfect for us since our baby is a light sleeper. They had the crib for us that we have asked for along with the small refrigerator for our baby's things. Even though the crib and the refrigerator were a little outdated but it okay to use it. The room size is very generous by any standard and the bathroom were separated into a powder room which was great to maneuver with the little one. Even though some of the amenities were outdated in the room, we were okay with the usage of them. Our room faced the city center and we had a great view of the city at night which we loved. It's close to all the area and most of the attractions are within walking distance if you like walking. The hotel staff were really good at recommending places for us to eat and we absolutely loved The Fish Market. The hotel staff were also really helpful in printing us directions for San Diego Zoo and Old Town.

There was a sitting chair, a desk with hard wired internet and an armoire with a television and DVD. The bed was large and firm and the pillows fluffy. The clock radio was made for an IPOD. The bathroom was large and clean and the shampoos and soaps were a good quality. Towels were big and fluffy. The floor didn't have an ice-maker and the valet had offered to bring some up for us. The elevators were fast. The bar on the lobby floor was quite small but large enough for a two piece band (that we didn't take the time to listen too). The only drawback to the room was the noise . . . although old and i would assume the walls were thick, there was very little sound proofing when the door was closed (you could see light from the hallway adjoining two rooms).

We were on the 9th floor and it has no view but that wasn't an issue at all. The beds are super comfy, and they have down comforters and down pillows. They will bring you \"hypo allergenic\" pillows at you're request. Plenty of towels, free wireless internet, free bottled water, and an in room dvd player. All great amenities!!! The hotel is VERY quiet. It's one of those things that if you didn't know it was there, you'd never know it was there. This section of downtown is quiet on the weekends because it's near office buildings, and the civic center (unless something is going on at the civic theater, which is right behind the hotel) It's across from Horton Plaza and the gaslamp is 2 tiny blocks away, so it's the perfect distance away. You don't hear the riff raff from the gaslamp, but are close enough to walk there. The trolly station is right behind the hotel, and if something happens, sometimes you can hear it, but it's very very faint and not bothersome in the least. The hotel is located downtown....which means you deal with downtown issues. San Diego is a large urban area with urban area problems. In walking downtown you will encounter homeless populations, and junkies. That's the city, and has nothing to do with the hotel. I would NOT advise staying here with small children unless you are planning on driving in and driving out. I tend to want to shelter my little ones. Parking is under the hotel and so technically unless you go walking, you will never interact with the undesireable aspect of the city. However, it's totally safe (we walked around after dark with no problems) as long as you're aware of your surroundings. Be prepared to pay handsomly for parking, but then again....it's downtown. I've paid handsomly for parking in every downtown that I've ever stayed in!", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sedona, AZ", "Title": "\u201cA Trip to Europe (While Staying in San Diego)\u201d", "Author": "David J", "ReviewID": "UR56582290", "Content": "We were just blown away by what an excellent value we landed in San Diego while staying recently at the Westgate Hotel.

We were in San Diego for a family wedding. Many activities were planned all over the San Diego area. The Westgate, located in downtown on the edge of the Gaslamp District, proved to be a very convenient starting point for all of them. I never had to drive more than 15 minutes to get anywhere. Our room was just beautiful. It was large, really large. I loved the dressing room that was separate from the bath. The shower had a seat, which is always a nice touch. The 2 queen beds were comfortable, the turndown service included two bottles of water and a full ice bucket as well as the usual chocolates on the pillow, the furnishings were well upolstered and plush. We could open our sliders and step out onto a narrow balcony (big enough to stand on but not big enough to accomodate a chair or table) with a lovely view of downtown, with the harbour visible in the distance. I found everything to be very clean. Another poster commented on the interesting \"suite-like\" configuration wherein there is a main door from the hallway that opens onto a foyer for two rooms across from each other. It certainly helps keep things quiet. Also, there was free, high-speed wireless internet in the room, which is something upon which I am becoming increasingly dependent when I travel. I had no problems with service. Check-in was smooth and we were directed immediately to our room in spite of having arrived several hours prior to the posted check-in time. Upon arrival in the room, I found that the airconditioning was not working. I called housekeeping and a repair person was in and out of the room within half an hour, and we had no further difficulties. I have never stayed anywhere with more efficient valet service. Even on weekend evenings when there are events at the hotel, I never waited more than a minute or two to take the car out. Rather than pulling up in front of the hotel, I always just drove the car down to the garage and left the key with the valet so there was never a wait at drop-off. The Westgate's style is definitely on the old-fashioned side in terms of style and furnishings. It is not in any way faded or run-down, but there are crystal chandeliers and gilt and embroidered upolsteries...think French Provincial. If modern, streamlined, less-is-more surroundings are more to your taste, then you may not like this much. Other family members (male) who also stayed there found it, while comfortable, a bit \"stuffy.\" The hotel is not quite a luxury hotel if the Georges V is your standard. There is the little something extra that the very best hotels offer mising here, but at $179/night for three (Thurs., Fri. and Sat.) nights and $209.00 for one (Sun.) night, it felt pretty darn luxurious to me! I should mention that there is a $28/night fee for parking. But even with the parking it was cheaper than many less well appointed properties. In all honesty, it was a steal! If I had a tour of the accomodations in advance and was asked to guess the price per night, I would have guessed in the $350-$400 range.

I had called earlier in the week to confirm my room and request a non smoking room with a bath tub. I spoke with Mrs. Markova and she was a delight. She informed me all of the rooms were non smoking. Upon arrival at 9 pm on June 1, we were greeted and told that we had been upgraded to a room with a bath tub. I was very happy as when I am vacationing I love to take baths. Upon arrival to the room I was very impressed with the high end decor and all marble bathroom. The room was spacious and elegant. I slept very well that night and my only complaint was the bad reception on the television. I shouldnt have been watching TV anyhow, I had to be up at 5.

There were a lot of couples like us about as well as many business people. The downtown area is home to many homeless, but I was very happy to see homeless assistance squads interacting with them. It was not like they were forgotten by the city. This really impressed me. I have traveled a lot and have never seen this much assistance in action. That night we stopped by the bar at the Westgate during the happy hour and I got a wonderful Kir Royale for $7. The service was friendly and professional. Every time we passed by the front desk we were greeted with our name, with the staff had went out of the way to remember it. That night we ate at about 10:40 PM in the bar from the restaurants menu.

That night the television had perfect reception. maybe it was a sign that I should have not been watching so late the night before. ;) Our sheets were lovely, and overall I would love to go back. Since we were leaving for a cruise, we were treated to a 2 PM checkout and we had the perfect amount of time to go eat and pack. Overall I would say that this is one of my most favorite places, and I have stayed at the St. Regis and The Ritz Carlton. I wish I would have had time to enjoy their award winning brunch or have High Tea there. Lastly, the overall design of this location is Palatial to say the least, and the Ballroom is the most beautiful in all of the Southland, and is named Versailles, and I would definitely say that name is fitting The only thing thi hotel is missing is a pool, but it is more than made up for in many other ways.

That is the difference and it seems the Westgate hotel recognizes this, and perhaps that is why they have an international staff. After valeting our car, when we arrived at the front desk, it was obvious the valet corresponded with the front desk as they called us by our name before my husband told them who we were. When we checked in, the clerk told us where the opera house was and told us about the pre-opera dinner at the hotel. This would normally not sound important but it means that when I booked our reservation, the call operator took a note of why we were visiting \u2013 to go to the opera and stay downtown afterwards. A note that the front desk clerk read and made mention of during our check in. She also asked us if she could walk us to our room, another simple service not frequently found in the US, except at the best hotels. While we don\u2019t need someone to take us to our room, it was a nice gesture. The room was beautiful, and the marble bathroom compliments the antique decor. I mention this because sometimes in hotels or bed and breakfasts that use antique decoration, cleanliness sometimes suffers but this is not the case at the Westgate. It was very clean. The food was, by far, my favorite part. We decided we will make the trip again just for dining. Again, service was five star and the food was perfect. While I like trying different things, my husband was so impressed with the food that we had breakfast there in the morning. I learned the difference between homemade juice and fresh juice.

The staff gave us a complimentary upgrade to a room on the 17th floor overlooking Horton Plaza, the NBC building, the bay and Coronado Bridge. BEAUTIFUL! When we got to the room, I was at first surprised by the decor. I felt as though I had stepped back in time into my grandmother's house that was still decorated in a very old school style. In defense of the hotel, the decor is supposed to be an older style. As I spent more time in the room, I realized that I actually liked the decor. It was very soothing, elegant and comfortable, and the colors were quite lovely - all except for the ridiculously hideous bed comforter. As it turned out, I was mostly bothered by that and not the rest. It was ugly and didn't properly match with the rest of the very nice decor. The room was also very large, spacious and bright. It had a very nice overall feel. Anyway, the bathroom was a nice size, but had some downfalls. First off, there was only one sink, and the vanity looked and smelled like it had been there for a little too long. It definitely needs some upgrading. Also, the sink area was carpeted. Yikes. The carpet looked clean and appeared to be in good shape, but seriously - carpet in ANY part of the bathroom is just not a good idea. Period. The shower/toilet area appeared to be old school marble, but the shower was a good size. The showerhead was far too low for my 6' husband, but was just fine for me. It was all very clean and was comfortable overall, but definitely not the Ritz or St. Regis. Some updates and changes would be good. Some other great things about the hotel stay were that the staff was always willing to call us a cab or help us with anything we needed in a very prompt manner.

My first and lasting impression is that the rooms are HUGE! They really are! Checked in late, but had no problems.

They don't have free internet, but they have a cable you buy from the mini bar for $10 and then you're set for the duration of your stay. Better than some hotels that charge $9.95 a day. Turn down service every night, and they play soft music on your TV. Ordered room service one morning, and they were very fast and food was good. The decor has a little over-the-top Versailles feel to it, but it's not that bad. I had to laugh at one of the reviews below. The elevators ARE really slow. The foyer thing to the rooms is a little odd too, although I\u2019ve seen it in other older hotels before. The annoying thing about the foyer setup is that you can hear the doors pretty loudly when you enter and leave your room. Luckily I had quiet neighbors. The hotel is right next to Horton Plaza, at the top of the Gaslamp. You\u2019re a short walk from all the restaurants and bars. What you are not close to is the convention center, however, the trolley stops right behind the hotel. It runs every 15 minutes to the convention center and costs $1.25. It is by far the easiest and fastest way to get down there. Overall, it\u2019s a nice hotel for the price. It might not be the hippest, newest hotel but it doesn\u2019t need to be when you have all the great bars/restaurants so close in the Gaslamp.

The good, the bad and the ugly...\u201d", "Author": "Payam81", "ReviewID": "UR15150198", "Content": "I (along with my significant other) spent 2 nights at this property to attend a wedding beginning of April 2008. If you walk in here expecting a 5 star property like a Four Seasons or some of the 5 star Hyatt's you will be disappointed as this hotel is: In terms of decor, amenities and general facilities: At best a 4 star (Correctly reflected on Expedia star rating for this hotel) In terms of management, service and attendance: At best a high end 3 star. I will try to get in to the guts of stuff: Location ----------- This hotel is located in an area bordering the Gaslamp District so you will find a lot of nice restaurants to eat at. It's also very convenient to get to from the 5 freeway. We didn't go out much so I won't comment much here. Overall I give Westgate a 4 out of 5 here. Lobby & General Hotel Areas: ----------- The designers aimed to go for the \"antique\" look throughout the hotel including old looking yellowish lighting pretty much all over the place. This means without a powerful external flash most cameras will have a problem with white balance and pictures WILL come out yellowish. The sofas in the lobby need replacement as they are not in the best shape specially if you are trying to sell your hotel as a 5 star property! The one time I needed to use the Business center at around 11 AM on a Saturday it was closed with a \"Will Be Back\" sign for 12:30 PM! The Elevators must be the S..L..O..W..E..S..T I've ever encountered in any hotels! While there is enough of them (or so it appears) for some odd reason the wait is sometimes longer than (gasp!) 10 minutes! (I kid you not!) Overall I give Westgate a 3 out of 5 here. Rooms ---------- This is where the hotel actually did NOT fall too short. The rooms are generally of a very good size but the fake \"antique\" theme from the lobby and general areas continues here with similar yellowish lighting (albeit much more subdued) but the carpet needs a good cleaning as ours wasn't the cleanest. Also the design of the rooms here are such that they will open in to a foyer that you share with your neighboring room before reaching to a double door linking both rooms to the hallway. What does this mean? It means amongst shared access also shared noise from the next door room! Also, there is NO in room safe and NO coffee maker! Also the bathroom door knob while looking \"antique\" and nice falls short in ergonomics forcing us to use towels to avoid getting cut by the flawed design. The actual shower while looking all nice was: A: Not very clean, signs of mold clearly present. B: Not very easy to get in and out so be mindful as the tub has a long ledge. Bed was comfortable enough but no match for the beds in lower star rated hotels like Sheraton or Marriott. Overall considering they have just refurbished the rooms in 2007 I was not impressed at all. Overall I give Westgate a 3 out of 5 here. Service and Staff: ---------- This is where this property falls flat face down! Westgate, if you truly believe you're a 5 star (or even a 4 star) you NEED to get service right! This means you need to have your staff greet the guests at every occasion! You need to have staff who jump out of their way for a quest! You need to have staff who will proactively (and seamlessly) work together. None of these were present in this hotel at our stay. While the staff are generally nice there is nothing that will again justify the rating. They will feel at home at a chain national 3 star anytime! The exception was the Valet service which for $25 / Day (Ouch!) and as the sole option for parking wasn't too impressive but more attentive than some of the other staff we encountered. I particularly had a very hard time with the check-in when I tried to switch my room and extend a day at the same time, it took me 10 minutes of explaining in very simple terms for them to finally figure what was it I wanted and even at that they could NOT meet my needs. The concierge basically consists of a single person (who is very nice actually) so if you need service while she's on break or doing something then you're out of luck! This was the most understaffed concierge that I had seen at any higher end hotel. Overall I give Westgate a 3 out of 5 here. Restaurants and Quality of Food: ---------- I just had to comment here about the quality of the food. While we never attended the hotel's restaurant and couple of bars per se the food we received at the wedding (which WAS from the same kitchen as the hotel's restaurant) was just terrible! Although the bride and the groom had spent a staggering amount of money, had I received that food in any other occasion it would go straight back to the kitchen! The steak I got was over cooked and very firm something like an Airline rubber chicken! The presentation was just awful with some artichoke's laying messy around the plate along with a couple of cut carrots. If this is what they serve in their restaurant (which I'm pretty sure is) I'd recommend to stay away and just spend time in one of the great eateries in the Gaslamp district within 10 minutes walk. Overall I give Westgate a 1 out of 5 here. I guess by now you know I'm not a big fan of Westgate Hotel in San Diego CA and I would NOT recommend it to any of my own friend's or family, specially for the prices they ask. There are so many other options out there so unless you're drawn to fake antique look or yellowish lighting and are willing to put up with the deficiencies and specially willing to accept the fake 5 star rating then go right ahead, it is by no means a bad place to stay at, it's just not up to what it claims to be or the premium $ it charges for the privilege of letting you stay there. One last thing I remembered to mention, I read their internal hotel magazine and I had a few remarks on that as well: First of all Westgate, get a proper illustrator if you're serious about this! The layout and fonts are so amateurish it would hardly pass for a class magazine let alone the \"Premier Magazine of Westgate Hotel\". Secondly, STOP plastering pictures of your owners, your owner's sons and daughters, your manager and your manager's wife! Pretty much %50 of the 10 or so pages magazine was dedicated to these pictures. I just do NOT find this is very professional. To sum it all up: This is NOT a 5 star hotel. Heck, it's not even a very good 4 star at that either! I would accept it if it was a 3.5 star and would do away with the pretence and I probably would have rated it high accordingly but what they really need is a Four Season's opening in the area, which is just inevitable as there are none in San Diego, and that would give the management here a much needed kick in the rear.", "Date": "April 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Margate, Florida", "Title": "\u201cVery elegant hotel\u201d", "Author": "hopegreaux", "ReviewID": "UR14769298", "Content": "I went to the Westgate for 2 days in February for business.

I booked a hotel through Hotwire, based on star rating and location in the Gaslamp quarter, and was pleased to find out we were staying at The Westgate. Despite a bland outside appearance, the interior architecture and decor of The Westgate has a European, and distinctly French, charm. The location to Horton Plaza and the restaurants/shops of the Gaslamp Quarter is certainly one of the main attractions to this hotel. (We even walked about 15 minutes to Petco Park for a baseball game). During check-in, we found the desk staff friendly and helpful. They upgraded us to a room on a higher floor. I was initially excited, but disappointed to step inside and have the NBC building directly across the street blocking much of the harbor view. The room itself was comfortable. Our bed was plush, with soft down pillows and a comforter. Two nightstands with marble tops were adjacent to the bed. In front of the sliding glass door to the balcony was a leather-topped work desk with complimentary Internet access. (Wireless is only available in the restaurant and bar). Also in the room were a chair and ottoman, television, DVD player, minibar, and phone with 2 separate lines. A bucket of ice was left during turn down service and a morning newspaper was delivered. The bathroom contained a vanity and an over-sized square-shaped marble shower/bathtub. ***The sides of the tub were very high and may not be suitable for those who have difficulty climbing in and out of a tub.*** Gilchrist & Soames toiletries were available as well as a hairdryer, two robes, an ironing board/iron and a vanity. The bathroom, although clean, felt run-down. The hotel really should repair the peeling wallpaper and consider better lighting. Valet service was quick, but the $24/night garage fee was ridiculously high, esp. for a hotel of this caliber. The other drawback to The Westgate is the traffic noise. Despite being in a room almost to the top of the hotel, the traffic noise on the street below was constant.

When we were first greeted we were told by the very lovely young woman at the front desk that we were upgraded to an upper floor (our room was 1689 I believe). When we saw the room we were floored! It was so elegantly decorated - with a beautiful bath and dressing area - and very roomy. The rooms were very quiet and the beds extremely comfortable. The maid responded very quickly to a request for a few additional pillows. As soon as we were settled in we had drinks at one of your bars - and - again - were greeted and served by a very sweet but professional young woman. We felt totally comfortable and decided right then and there that if we could have we WOULD have booked an extra day or two. We were thinking about going out for dinner - but opted on having dinner at your restaurant (the cafe) because the menu did look very good. The wait staff was great and so was the food. Breakfast the next day was also a delight. People say that your hotel room is not a big deal because you don't spend all day in your room. You are out sight-seeing most of the time. This is not true for us. Even though we spent the entire day at the zoo - and also visited Coronado in the short time we were in San Diego, the hotel and the hotel room are VERY important to us. The hotel can make or break your vacation time. Again - from the bell man who took our bags to our room to the young man who retrieved our car for us on the morning we left, we were treated with extraordinary courtesy.

If the remote control to the television set was placed at the foot of the bed before we went shopping. Why on earth was it at the head of the bed on the floor where it could not be reached. I had to forcibly place my arm between the bed and floor to retrieve it. 2. Why did the maid know where the remote was on the floor at the foot of the bed. Answer: My Chargers backpack was in the vicinity. 3. Most travelers know, when a remote control is found by the maid in the room. They place it back on the entertainment center, not the head of the bed on the floor. 4. The investigation by Law Enforcement standards was weak. The fact that they (management) were more concerned about not being liable than locating my backpack was really disappointing. In all my medication, camera, jewelry, passport, address book and other miscellaneous items were taken without consent. No question in my mind the Hotel is beautiful and quaint.

In hindsight, we realize the modern vibe at some of the other downtown hotels is a better fit for us (we're in our 30s). The Good: Very nice, clean, spacious rooms; great beds; lovely welcome tray (chocolate truffles!); small balcony (see below); good bathroom amenities; strong water pressure; eager turn-down service. Rooms are set away from hallway by a door, so hallway noise is minimal. Had a decent bay view. Great location; Horton plaza is right there, quick walk to Gaslamp and other great restaurants. A few blocks from convention center, easily walkable. Free airport shuttle. The bellman (Sergio) was super-helpful. The Not-So-Good: While no hotel is perfect, the small annoyances at the Westgate would have been more bothersome had we been paying the full rate (often more than $400). Downtown San Diego is loud & our balcony doors did not lock! We heard lots of street noise by 6AM and were kept up by an outside hotel party into wee hours of morning, despite being on 11th floor. Small gym is fine, but hotel was fully booked, so the 5 cardio machines were not enough. Our towels and robe were not replenished one day. Desk staff was very polite, but not particularly effective. The gilded lobby is small, with most of the space going to an area of tables where afternoon tea is served. Lastly, we were charged for something from minibar we didn't use (they said they'd reverse the charge). For one night of our reservations, they charged us a few dollars more than quoted. It was only $6, so we didn't care & didn't mention it. But, combined with the last-minute minibar charge, we were left with a bit of a bad taste in our mouths.

Since the hotel is located a bit away from the bay there were a lot of downtown buildings that obstructed our view. From our room #1695 we had views from 12 to one o'clock and 10 to 11 o'clock. If you stepped on the balcony (no seating, just a small space to area out) you had better views from 8 o'clock 11 o'clock partially obstructed by buildings.

Not a problem for us, but when thrown in with the Westgates 'individual' approach of having communal doors to two suites it resulted in us being woken at 3.30am, 4.15am, 5.20am as revellers sans keys returned to the suite opposite us. Not ideal when we were looking for some sleep after a long drive. Moved to a different room the next night, guess what - big shock, the same thing happened again. The staff were perfectly pleasant, but clearly feel they are living in the times when Princess Margaret and Kris Kristofferson (as they cheesily list in their guestbook) stayed there when in fact it is more Porky's.

The only drawbacks I found to my stay were how expensive all of the restaurants in the hotel were (even a light, late-evening snack will set you back $20-$25) and their \"high-speed internet\" was not wi-fi, but an ethernet line in every room. Had I known this in advance I could have brought my connector cord with me and saved the $10 on the ethernet cable available in the mini-bar. All in all, though, it was a truly great hotel.", "Date": "September 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "tucson", "Title": "\u201cVery relaxing\u201d", "Author": "wildcatgary", "ReviewID": "UR5727146", "Content": "What a wonderful place. Not perfect but wonderful. Not new but very elegant. Service effort was spotless. Everyone did everything they could to make you feel like a true guest. I never touched my luggage once I got in the limo / van from the airport. Room service brought the biggest bucket of ice you have ever seen. In 20 mins. Everything took 20 mins. Picked up at airport, 20 mins. Ice, 20 mins, luggage to room, 20 mins. Wait for ride to airport, 20 mins. That's the only down side. Accept check in and out was instant. The view and room are perfect. Plenty of room. Yes a little noisey, but your downtown. Stayed facing north, 17 floor. paid about 190 on expedia. Slept with balcony doors open and heard the usuualy downtown noice. No problem sleeping. I WOULD stay again. Location is the excellent for walking to dinner out and a evening in gaslamp.

Fourtunantly my husband and I have a sense of humor. Large rooms, beautiful decor, marble counter tops, marble shower and great water pressure. Turn down service at night which was awesome! Shuttle service to and from the airport, zoo and Seaworld. We were lucky to even get one of the bellman to take us down to gaslamp district one night on his reccomendation to Taka. Good food. (Japanesse) Location is terrific. Close to trolley which can take you to old town. The bus is close also, we took it to Balboa Park to the museums one day. When at Balboa Park, eat at the Prado Restaurant. Awesome food and price is just right. The Westgate Cafe was elegant and perfect. Ate there two times for breakfast and once for dinner-one word, deliicious! For all of you ladies, go to tea which is served in the hotel lobby from 2:30pm-5pm. Fun, fun! The hotel is decorated so elegantly, but far from stuffy. The staff all make you feel at ease. Hope you enjoy your stay!
