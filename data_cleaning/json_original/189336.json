When I arrived, the manager watch me struggle up the stairs with my luggage and didn't move an inch. I caught him looking at me and he still didn't offer to help. He told me my room was on the first floor and directed me to the lift, however it turned out my room was on the lower ground floor, through a heavy wooden door. I put my bags down, and after a 30 hour flight from Australia, I was looking forward to some quiet, a hot shower and a long sleep. I walked into the bathroom to find it had someone else's POO in there. I called the manager and he promptly found me another room. However, this room was right below reception, with its wooden floor. For a few seconds I thought we were having a storm. Then I realised it was from the people walking above me. All I could hear was the thumping of running children and the thunder of wheeled suitcases being dragged and thumped across the floor. There was no way anyone would be able to sleep with the constant noise. I promptly picked up my bags, and for the first time ever, I walked out. When I got to reception, I told the manager that I couldn't stay in the hotel with rooms like that and could he please call me a taxi. He shrugged, not even bothering to ask me if he could do anything about it, and walked outside, pushing past me as I was again struggling to get my bags out of the door. Thankfully he flagged down a cab, but walked off without even a sorry or a goodbye.

This could well be a problem in humid summer months, but wasn't really an issue in January, other than my bathroom mirror remained steamed up longer than I would have liked!

Also a strange smell coming from the sink, a common problem in HIX hotels as they do not seem to clean the bit of the plug that goes down the sink, which you have to invariably pull out as they never seem to work correctly. Breakfast was the usual stuff, although the room was a bit cramped. The bar at night time is tiny with only ine draft lager, and there is no food available so you have to dine out.

The price on display by reception was \u00c2\u00a3229+vat!!!!!! a ridiculous amount for this sort of hotel. Reception was friendly and we were told the room was quite large. We were put in a twin room in the basement, i felt like one of the servants in victorian times and it was like sharing a room in a work place,but as it was for one night only i accepted this. The window had large security bars on it which was a bit scary in case of fire but it did open to let in fresh air as the corridor and room smelt a bit musty and damp. It had tea and coffee but a dodgy kettle which only stayed boiling with the help of leaning on a tea spoon, very health and safety. We did mention this on leaving the next morning, still we could have a brew. My bed was sort of clean but still felt like it had not been change recently or the sheets were not fully washed and starched, i did have a good look in and around it for cleanliness before i slept in it but the bed was comfortable. The room was clean but a bit grubby, it felt like it was possible a staff bedroom in use for customers in busy times. Though i was told this was not the case next morning. In the morning i was woken by the smell of cigarette smoke and had to shut the window due to the staff smoking outside in some sort of basement storage cellar so we could not open the curtains or window the next morning before leaving. The shower was very good but there was some sort of odd wiring visible below the sink which i was told was earth wire which i thought should have been boxed in and not visible. Breakfast was complimentary which was a good thing and was fairly nice though a bit of a free for all as the room was small, the customers many and you had to help yourself buffet style in a small kitchen area and get milk out of a fridge and plates out of a cupboard, the hot sausages and scrambled eggs were a bit dangerous and i had to ask for help as im small and could not reach and it was very hot with no cloth to hold the pans, still all in all breakfast was fresh and nice.

We flew into London from the Caribbean and were flying out 2 days later to Thailand so wanted somewhere central to meet friends and shop with easy access to Gatwick and Heathrow Airports. After reading some of the less favorable reviews we didn't have high expectations but as it was somewhere simply to sleep we thought the cost fair for a central London hotel. On arrival at 10am we were told that the room we had booked (inadvertantly the family room) wasn't ready but we could have a double straight away. As we had been travelling for 10 hours and had a meeting at 2pm in the city we opted to take the double for a quick shower and power nap. The room was tiny and we would have no doubt had a bigger room if we'd stuck with our original booking, but we're used to living in a small cabin on a yacht so that didn't bother us. There was no A/C in the room and it was surprisingly hot in London, but with the window open and the fan supplied on it was fine. The room was spotlessly clean and modern and the bed small but comfortable. The internet was expensive and as we'd read about it's lack of speed we didn't bother.

When it came down to it, we needed a family room to accomodate 4 of us and we didn't want to pay the extortionate prices a lot of hotels wanted from us. We had the choice between Hammersmith which was a bit further out than we wanted and Victoria. Looking at things Pimlico was our nearest tube station so changing at victoria for the 2 minute ride after we came from Paddington was quite easy. The first problem was which exit to go out of. Rayneman is the best exit and you cross the road by the library before heading straight past the shops and on to St George's Square and turning right. On the opposite side of the street a few seconds walk you will find the hotel at 106. It's clearly marked. The area is quiet and we felt extremely safe here. We did realise that we were in the flight path early one morning when someone left our window open overnight. But otherwise you heard the odd banging off doors but not much else. On entering the hotel as I did every time I walked in the front door, I tripped over the step. Check in was done efficently and quickly with everything explained easily. Our room was on the ground floor overlooking some flats. We could see a roof outside our room and further along the conservatory roof of the breakfast room. Our room was very spacious for an Express. We had a fold out sofa bed at one end and a proper double bed at the other. The toilet was just next to the double bed. The TV was facing the sofa bed which seemed a bit odd as we'd normally put the children in the sofa bed and watch tv. Tea and coffee facilities were provided but we never used them. The bathroom wasn't your usual express layout. This one didn't have the door which made the toilet area more private. The shower was ok and the space was bigger than we have had in the past at other hotels. Overall it was all very clean and tidy. Breakfast is held 7.30-10.30am on weekends and 7-10am on week days. Breakfast room is very small and in the basement. The steps down were a bit narrow and there was a minor step to the top of these stairs which you had to watch incase you fell down. The tables are a bit squashed. There was a range of 4 cereals, 2 types of bread, croissants and a couple of pastries. Some yoghurts and grapefruits were available with some fresh fruit such as apples, pears or oranges. They also had some small rolls one morning. We did hear someone ask if they had something else and being told that if it wasn't on the shelf then there was none left. There was a bar next to reception with a small lounge area. Staff were attentive and helpful everytime we went. There was a vending machine but we advise using one of the shops down the street for water and snacks. The internet access was \u00c2\u00a31 for 10 minutes and painfully slow. We gave up attempting to check in for our flight as it was taking too long. Staff were helpful at telling you how to get places and the best routes to take. Overall as a base to be in London we found this location to be ideal and that the tube service was very good and quicker than we have had in previous stays around London. The victoria line gives easy access to anywhere and I would recommend this as a base to anyone who is looking for a quiet safe area to stay in.", "Date": "October 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worthing", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "worthingwanderer", "ReviewID": "UR20891701", "Content": "We wanted a hotel within walking distance of Victoria Station, and thought it safer to opt for a recognised chain, as some London privately owned hotels can be a bit substandard.

Check-in was friendly, and there was no problem about the fact it was only just after midday. We had a room on the 5th (top) floor, at the back, with views across South London and Battersea Power Station. The room was very quiet, - in fact we began to wonder if the hotel was empty. Our room was small but comfortable, and I was particularly pleased we could open the windows fully for fresh air. Throughout our stay the staff were always very friendly and helpful The only grumbles were the a) lack of power in the shower. At times it was more like a dribble - possibly a result of being on the top floor. and b) the size of the breakfast room in the basement. We were fairly early, and managed to find a table, but there were guests milling around waiting for people to finish and leave so they could sit down. It was also a bit hot there when it was full of people. Location wise the hotel was perfect. The 24 bus went past the door, giving direct links to Westminster, Victoria, and Trafalgar Square. We were able to walk to Pimlico tube, and also to Tate Britain and the river.
