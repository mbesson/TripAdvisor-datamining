Hence, my reason for selecting this particular property as I was important for me to be in close proximity to the LA Convention Center where I was attending the Fit Expo. However, upon checking in. I felt great because the lobby looked great and the Building's apprearance...especially outside looked great. Well once I got to my room i was just too annoyed. Furnitures were soooooo old, worned out and shaken....even the table where the tv sits...was broken. Only sensible thing was the bed. Room looked like something from the 50's. I was like ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? For the price they charge the properties ought to be better. I know its not a 4 star property but still. I called the front desk immediately. They were very nice.!!! that's the only positive thing I can say about this property. The front desk staff....(whether male or female) were super courteous, warm and helpful. Back to my issue.. The front desk then changed my room immediately then placed me in the another room...which was a little better but still has this strange touch.. GRRRRR....by now I was a bit tired and couldn't take another move....cause this was all after a 6 hour flight and coming from the east coast to the west coast with the slight time difference I was getting sleepy... and needed to get some sleep. So I just took the other room the front desk rep gave me...which was a little better but could still use a face-lift. All in all....I can't say that I'd stay at this property again if I'm in the L.A. area. I'd search for other low cost hotels in the area that is sure to offer a tad bit better amenities.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWould not stay here again\u201d", "Author": "N_M495", "ReviewID": "UR124043770", "Content": "I've read a lot of reviews on here that mention ants, or bugs, however I did not find any of that.

GET A ROOM W/ POOL VIEW (GIVES YOU A PRIVATE BALCONY) OR A ROOM THAT OPENS OUT TO THE GARDEN AREA. absolute must have rooms to even enjoy the hotel. CONS! 1. OUTRAGEOUSLY ANNOYING PARKING SITUATION. They have limited cover parking; if that's taken up, you have to park across the street in a parking lot. You have to have your room key to even access the damn parking lot. (safety first , i know but jeez). The worst part - The damn \"parking security guard\" harasses you constantly. Even though he knows you stay at the hotel and you MUST have your room key to access parking lot across the street, he still watches you & questions you like a little kid (what room you are in, how long you're staying, you're full name, where you parked, etc.) He didn't do anything with the information he was requesting- just wanted to be nosey. I have a feeling he was a bit raciest as my husband is black and i'm white && the parking guy seemed to watch us and question us like we committed murder. This was soo annoying, I even complained about him. 2. Hallways are extremely smelly. Either fishy, urine or too much cleaning supplies. 3. once again, there was a language barrier with pretty much all staff but all in all, they were friendly (except for the damn parking guy). 4. In order to use the in room phone you have to pay to have it hooked up. Then, the staff doesn't even know the charges to use the phone as they are not even the ones who bill you. Highly advise you just use cell (if you get reception) or use lobby pay phone. 5. Make sure you don't want a late night snack. They lock up the little snack store they have in lobby and you have to ask them to unlock it, wait for them to open up register, then buy your night time snack. 6. ANTS ANTS ANTS. I complained to the manager; she hardly understood what i said but stated that 1 time a year, they have ants. She gave me her card and told me to contact her if i were to stay there again; buut she didn't take my name down- so how would she even know it was me?? annoying!!!

Location: The location is actually pretty decent. It\u2019s on the outskirts of the downtown area in the heart of Korea town. There is a 7-11 and several fast food options in the immediate area. I don\u2019t know if it is fair to call this a Convention Center hotel though. It\u2019s a good mile away from the Convention Center and they don\u2019t offer a shuttle. If you were to walk there, you would be going underneath the 110 overpass, which is always dicey. The area itself was safe but there is absolutely nothing to do there for the English speaking world. The only cabs we saw were dropping people off from other areas. Of the hotels/motels in the immediate area, this looked to be the best. I liked that the highway was a half a mile from the hotel as we were exploring areas outside of the downtown area. Staff: The staff had a pretty lax attitude with us. Nothing was very memorable at all. They never greeted us or opened doors and didn\u2019t seem to be knowledgeable about the area. We asked the lady at the check-in desk about a recommendation for a good Korean restaurant in the area and she suggested a place down the alley behind the hotel. When pressed, she simply printed out a map of the area and tried to navigate the places for us. She thought that Beverly Hills was within walking distance until I pointed out that we are in downtown LA. We made due, but it would be nice if they explored the area for their guests. Their on site restaurant was never mentioned, which we took it as a sign for the quality and never tried it. Hotel: The hotel was in better condition than I expected after reading the reviews here. The lobby was small but quaint. Our room overlooked the courtyard on the 2nd level and was big enough for our purposes. However, I did have several issues with the room itself. First, the energy saving light bulbs are annoying. It takes about 3 minutes after turning on the light for it to reach its maximum brightness. At night, when it\u2019s pitch black, that makes it a little difficult to navigate through the room in a makeshift night light. The second was the pillows. On a Queen sized bed, you are given 4. But they are literally a 2X2 in size. The sheets are also paper thin and you only get two of them. I\u2019ve had better bedding at a youth hostel personally. The room itself has a distinct musty smell that lingered so long that we had to open up a window to air it out. The TV channels were probably 50% English, 40% Korean and 10% Spanish. I believe that they have Encore as your movie channel option. Was an LCD TV, but no HD in the room. Perhaps the biggest gripe is the parking. Yes, it is free. But that parking garage was designed by a blind man. What should only hold 15 cars max holds 30. More often than not, we had to have the hotel valet move the cars so that we could back the car up. There is one entrance and exit and you had to be a professional driver to navigate around the pillars and other cars to avoid contact. The parking lot across the street is a much better option\u2026but it wasn\u2019t working as intended. You are supposed to open up the gate with your room key but it was never a problem for anyone to pull in. Price: I utilized Wyndham\u2019s Best Rate Guarantee to get my price down to $60.00 per night. This was a pretty fair price for what we got. I wouldn\u2019t pay anymore than $80.00 per night though.

We planned this small getaway just to go to Universal Studios and the Medieval Times, but we also did some sightseeing in Santa Monica, Venice Beach, Griffith Observatory, Chinatown, El Pueblo de los Angeles and Hollywood. I traveled with my wife and two teen daughters. I read the reviews here on Tripadvisor and found some of them terrible, talking about bedbugs, unsanitary baths, etc... but I didn't find anything like that; rooms are pretty decent. They seemed to be recently renovated, good bedding items, kind of new drapes, room is nice. It has great towels & pillows which is a big plus for this hotel category. Room and premises are really clean. Including the pool. Pool is supposed to be heat (and maybe it is), but being like 80 deg. it could be a little chilly for some people. Staff in general is polite and friendly; basically Mexican (or latinos) and Koreans. They have breakfast but not included in the price, so you have to pay $4.99 per person, so if you are on a budget and traveling with family you should consider this to decide against a Holiday Inn Express or a La Quinta, where breakfast is normally included. Also, they advertise to have WiFi; but the service they have is pretty lame. Makes look dial-up a thing of the future. I called the reception and they blamed on the large quantity of guest who carry a laptop nowadays (which it could be truth). This is a good option in general but something happened the last day. I went to the pool with my two daughters; I stayed there for a few minutes and went back to my room to take a shower and check out. My daughters stayed in the pool; minutes later my oldest daughter came back and told us a \"chinese\" guy had told them to get out of the pool because they were not guests. I guess it was a Korean, since it is in Koreantown and I saw many things in Korean in this hotel. He was super-rude with my daughter demanding the room number and last name, my daughter told him the room number but not the name, he was all pissed screaming. I called the front desk and they explained to me that there are some apartment buildings around the hotel and kids sneak into the pool all the time; well, it's understandable that they try to enforece security, but there are polites ways to treat guests, especially when they are minors.

The AC was broken and, upon calling the front desk, we were laughed at.

The supposed \"high speed internet\" costs and additional 19$ per day and does not work. This was actually the first problem that we ran into and called the front desk about. Upon calling, they gave us a tech support number which we could not call because the phone only worked for calls within the hotel. It took three more calls to the front desk and about 20 minutes to get the phone working and another 4 hours and seven phone calls before we gave up on ever getting internet. 19$ a day for nothing and when we asked for a refund, the clerk literally laughed in our faces. And the ants. Oh, the ants. Ants, spiders, bugs, every night, all over the place. We ordered a pizza from the nearby domino's (which was delivered to us quickly according to the domino's place, only a 90 minute wait, though that is hardly the hotel's fault) and overnight lost that and any other food we brought with us which wasn't sealed as if for a camping trip. If you are wondering however, it was the proximity to the dominos The hotel layout itself was terrible. We had to take something around 4 left turns into sub-hallways in order to find our room and each hallway had its own distinct aroma ranging from decomposing trash to stale urine. I'll leave it at that. As you can tell, the service was beyond awful. Having three people and only receiving two beds and not the extra bed we were promised because \"the two extra beds are in use\", we requested a cot only to discover that they had no cots either.

Not my kind of nightlife. I love to go out and have fun but I sadly cannot check the nightlife box as, after the first night and hearing the shooting, I barely felt like leaving my room the next morning. It was only because the room itself was so bad that I was able to get myself out of it. This was a horrible experience and I would never recommend it to anyone.

I liked the feel of the place, and the room was good, shower, basin, sliderobe where you could hang your clothes and this also contained a safe which you could enter a 4 digit PIN number to open & close, came in very handy. The bed was fine and I had a TV and a desk with chairs, I even had a fridge and a coffee machine. Everything was clean and functional. If you are going to the Staples center or The Convention center this hotel is about a 15 to 20 minute walk, I wouldn't advise walking at night, better to take the bus, I used the No. 29 which ran very regular and only cost $1.25. I walked during the day but if you are tired its nice to know a bus is on hand if you need it. If I was to suggest something to the owners to change, I'd say move the fridge away from the bed to the opposite side of the room, it can buzz a bit at night and if you are a light sleeper it might annoy you a little.

It is a shame because this hotel does have great amenities. Off the lobby there are shops and a restaurant which thankfully are not managed by the same people as the hotel. The hotel itself is older but seems well kept and the parking garage is a great asset in L.A. However the absent communication between the desk and housekeeping equates to dirty rooms and violations of guests peace and privacy. Worse, when these deficiencies are pointed out the staff responds with rude behavior or empty promises. My experience with this hotel began well and then went down hill. Unhappy with the location of the original hotel I had booked I called Choice Hotels for an alternate location and found this hotel. Unfortunately they were not able to complete the reservation because their computers were down and my WiFi was not working so Choice gave me the number and I called the hotel directly. The young lady who answered was very pleasant and I booked a room. Upon arrival I found a very well appointed older hotel and was pleased with the value and the service of the young lady I had spoken with who was at the desk. The service made me smile and look forward to a pleasant stay. That is until walking into the room. The door was ajar when I arrived and it became apparent the housekeeping had not completed their tasks. Pillows were missing from the bed, the linens had not all been replaced, and the room had not been vacuumed. Later I found the refrigerator had a spill which was leaking out. Seeing the condition of the room I called the desk for another but they encouraged me to stay in the room when I asked to do it later because I was running tight for an appointment and needed to take a shower and change. They offered instead to send housekeeping if I called when ready . It seems the desk never contacted housekeeping because as I stepped wearing only a towel into dressing area the housekeeper came in to the great embarrassment of both of us. She hurriedly dropped a few towels and left. While I understand her angst she never returned to finish cleaning though I again called the desk and they apologized and said the room would be made and the Manager would call me the next morning. I came back late that evening to find the room in the same state. By then food and liquid left in the fridge had begun to seep out and I used the few towels I had left. The air conditioning had been off so there was an odor. I called the desk and again they would not offer another room, nor would they provide pillows or towels and the desk clerk was very rude. He said if I did not like the room they had a \"satisfaction guaranteed policy\" and the manager would refund in the morning. Notably this never happened The stench in the room was unbearable so I cleaned the mess they should have then opened the window and turned the air conditioning on to ventilate and cool the room and went out so it could air. As I passed the desk the clerk was in an animated conversation with another man using colorful language. Later I returned to my room and called down for a wake up call and a late check out. No wake up call came and I missed breakfast. I woke because housekeeping walked in again though there was a Do Not Disturb on the door. The clerk had not put in my late check out. I called the desk to complain again and and had a difficult time getting a late checkout though it is a benefit of the the rewards program I belong to with the chain. They did finally give me the late checkout. Though polite at this time, and though they did acknowledge the legitimacy and seriousness of my complaint the staff said they could do nothing to assist me and I needed to talk to the manager who was off property. Later I found this was not true. I asked for housekeeping to clean my room when I went out to eat and they refused saying I was checking out that day. Apparently clean rooms are not part of staying at this hotel. After an early lunch I finally found the General Manager. He was very polite gentleman from Korea I believe and shared a few nice stories about his homeland. He said how embarrassed he was about the terrible service, though in retrospect he seemed more concerned about an unauthorized person being behind his register with the night clerk than my problems. I explained how the clerk had said rather than deal with my problem I could ask for a refund but what I had wanted was the room clean and right not the money. He did offer to refund the room but suggested as it was a business stay and really did not benefit me, he offered a return stay. He was so gracious I honestly I felt this service was an anomaly and accepted his offer. \\The reason I accepted is the hotel is in a great location and the attached Japanese restaurant is outstanding. I ate there three times and enjoyed every meal and the extraordinarily good service. Sorry I cannot recall the name but if you do take the trouble to find it, try the lunch special. It mixes tempura sushi and sashimi and while not cheap is great food at a great value. There is also an unusual store there in the form of a quaint mountaineering and sportswear store. They staff there is very friendly and knowledgeable. I really enjoyed it and bought a few things. >When I left I felt my visit had been a trial but fairly good about the hotel because of the graciousness of the Manager. It seemed that he would make it irght. However it was a placebo, and apparently not an effort to do the right thing. A week or two later I called seeking to give them another chance as the Manager had requested and offered. As a matter of fact I was optimistic I attempted to book a weekend which would have resulted in two paid days in addition to the one he offered. The staff was very rude. Desk Managers represented themselves as the General Manager. One woman I spoke with said yes she was aware of the problem and would offer me a minor discount off of rack rate which amounted to significantly more then either my AAA or Choice Privileges would provide me.I called Choice Hotels and they offered me a contact and finally a transfer took me to to the business office only to miss the GM. I did reach the accountant who was a nice guy and promised to give my number of the General Manager. No one called. Had I booked through Choice I would have a recourse. Unfortunately I was not able to. Needless to say I would not recommend this hotel. > > --------------------- >", "Date": "December 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manteca, California", "Title": "\u201cBoutique Style Hotel near Downtown LA\u201d", "Author": "on-the-journey", "ReviewID": "UR21452297", "Content": "Some of the reviews here had me hesitant to try the Clarion.

However, it was 1.5 miles /2.4 Km from Westin Bonaventure Hotel, at 404 S. Figueroa St., Los Angeles, where I was attending a convention (8/2-8/9/08). Also, I often stay at other Clarions and Comfort Inns. I took a chance and was satisfied. Though the Olympic Blvd area is a combination of Hispanic and Koreatown, the people staying there are families, business people and others on a vacation. I did not go walking in area as I used my car to get around. The Clarion Hotel Downtown, 1901 West Olympic Blvd. Los Angeles CA 90006 (213) 385-7141 is two blocks east of S. Alvarado St. It is mostly on Bonnie Brae Street. That is the entrance that you enter (or thru the parking garage). Unfortunately, there is only one marked handicapped parking space. There is some under the hotel parking (if you're early in) and the rest is across the street in a fenced parking lot which is well-lighted (your key controls gate). The parking lot is between an apartment building and another motel. And, there is a Korean church beside the hotel. There is a Korean restaurant on the corner and a Sushi restaurant beside the front entrance on West Olympic Blvid. Bonnie Brae Street is a quiet street. There is a night guard on duty in the hotel's parking garage and he has two video screens to watch the outside parking lot, the parking garage (he's right next to the indoor one), all of the halls, pool area, two large patios, lobby, etc. I felt secure. I was impressed that there were usually three hotel personnel at the front desk most times. And, the manager was nearby. It is a Korean run hotel. They are pleasant and always kind. When someone parked their car too close behind mine in the parking garage, two women from the front desk kindly directed my backing out of the space. I found the Clarion clean, nicely decorated and the beds are great for sleeping. There are two elevators for the three floors. That's nice if one is not working properly, which can happen anywhere. My room had a wide screen tv [although, not all rooms have wide screens], a 1100 watt microwave with a turntable, an excellent refrigerator, coffeemaker, iron & board, a gas-lift high back business chair with arm rests, a desk lamp and two phones (one on nightstand with dual lamps & AM-FM clock radio). Fortunately, they had used an extension cord that one would plug in the refrigerator and microwave or coffee maker. That way, the freezer was not iced up as it would be if it were constantly on. I wish some other motels would defrost their refrigerator's freezers! The fluorescent lamps (14 watts) need more wattage in the bulbs. They equal about 50 watts which is not enough to easily read by. 23 watts=100 watts which would be better. (Hopefully, they'll use cool white bulbs, not the warm ones, which are yellow. Note: 3500 K temperature rated bulbs are bright white without having the ultraviolet rays of full-spectrum. Those would be perfect). My room overlooked the pool area. There are some rooms with a balcony, chairs and a table overlooking the pool. There are also two other areas that have large patios with chairs and tables in a courtyard on the 2nd floor. I did have trouble connecting with a cell phone tower due to being in the pool courtyard. It is always good to carry a prepaid phone card to use with the land-line... The air filter was clean! The only complaint I have is that the heating system is central, although you can turn on/off the air conditioner which is above the entrance way in your room. Althought this was the first week of August, the nights were 67\u00baF/19\u00baC cool to cold depending upon you metabolism. I turned off the AC and the thin comforter kept me somewhat warm. The hair dryer turned on and placed on the upside down metal trash basket was my heater. And, for those who'd like some fresh air, the sliding glass window can be opened; although, there is no screen. The water from the faucet was very hot. They could turn it down 30 degrees and still satisfy everyone, while wasting less energy. Fortunately, they used a easy to figure out shower control. Throughout the Choice Hotels chain of 11 branded hotel/motels, the shower heads vary and can be confusing. I wish they would standardize them with a handle and face plate that shows blue color for cold with an increasing combo of blue & red color for warm then, red for hot. There is no free continental breakfast. You buy your breakfast there...or elsewhere.
