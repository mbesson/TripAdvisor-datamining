I had to drag my luggage up a flight of stairs to 1 platform and then use an elevator to get to the exit. I got there early and I was able to store my luggage for free. Although it was about 11am I was told my room number and I was checked-in, but I had to wait until the official check-in time to go to my room. I knew that anyway so I left my luggage and began to explore the city. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. The breakfast was a nice spread it consisted of coldcuts (cheese and meat), yogurt, cereal, hard boiled eggs, juice, milk, coffe and tea. The room was a very good size. It was on the 5th floor it was nicely heated. It had a wardrobe closet, dresser, an ironing board and pants press machine. The carpet was old and stained but it seemed clean. The bathroom had a full bathtub. There is a T.V but there were only 3 channels. Although the room is made up everyday the sheets were not changed during our 7 day stay.

All in all it's good value for money given it's location and compared to other London prices. It's not what I'd call 'high class' but definitely a good hotel. You'll enjoy your stay if your not expecting spectacular views (the back garden has a few 'tip like' qualities) but don't let this put you off.

The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was seriously outdated, the wallpaper was peeling, the bathroom ceiling was mouldy, the window was held open with a coat-hanger, the mini-bar was broken, the trouser-press was broken, the air conditioning was broken, the toilet wouldn't flush, the shower was either ice cold or as hot as the sun and there was no kettle or any luxuries to speak of. The heat was a real issue as our broken air-conditioner was replaced with a small noisy table fan which had to run throughout the night. Our window overlooked \"the garden\" which was simply a wasteland. There were workmen out there throughout the day burning waste, drilling and sawing. The noise was unbelievable. There was also no curtain on the window, rather a thin, see-through blind which didn't reach the bottom of the window and offered no sound-proofing and little privacy. The breakfast was laughable although it was complimentary. The meat offered with the continental breakfast looked very low-quality and frankly, I was afraid to go near it. Needless to say, we skipped breakfast on our second day. The housekeeping service appeared to be replacing the towels and making the bed. No noticeable cleaning or replacing of sheets was carried out. The free wi-fi seems like a good deal until you realise that many of the rooms (including ours) cannot access it. The final insult was the offer of looking after our bags on the final day where we were asked to leave them in the open, publicly accessible lounge where anyone could have strolled in and taken them. When we went back to get them I made a point of letting the receptionist know we had picked them up which was met with a confused and disinterested response. This hotel is not value for money.

Airfare AND hotel for the two of us was just about $200.00 more than JUST the airfare we paid for ONE of us when we were last in the UK in July 08. After booking, I looked up My Place here....and started to get nervous! There was absolutely nothing to worry about however! I would stay at My Place again in a heartbeat! Let's begin with location - less than a 1 minute walk from the Earl's Court tube station - you cannot ask for more convenience!! We took the tube from Heathrow airport, and were at the hotel in no time. Once you have settled in, there are more choices than you will know what to do with for food options. Within five minutes walking distance, you can find French, Italian, English, Lebanese, Indian, Chinese, &c, &c, and for those who want it - McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks and KFC. There is a bakery for pasteries and coffee in the morning, a shop right at the tube station for Cornish pasties, and for excellent late night food (open till 4am on weekends!) the Star Kebab House. The hotel itself offers a continental breakfast included with the price of the room, but if you want a full English, skip the hotel's offering at \u00c2\u00a39.95 per person extra and walk across the street to Benji's and you can have TWO full English breakfasts - at any time of the day no less! - for \u00c2\u00a39.99. There are at least four pubs within a one minute walk of the hotel, all of which offer food as well. For late night drinks, look no further than the nightclub in the basement of the My Place Hotel! While we were there, the club was only opened on Friday and Saturday nights till 2am, and we took advantage of this once the pubs shut (last call is generally around 10:30pm, unless the establishment is licensed to be open later). The club may be open more often during the Summer tourist season - check with the hotel when you book. There is also a late night lounge called Mango on the Earl's Court Road, which is opened til 2am Mon thru Sat. The My Place Hotel is also within walking distance to TONS of things to do/see! Kensington Palace and gardens are less than 1 mile walking, The Victoria & Albert and the Natural History museums are about 1 mile away, Brompton Cemetery is about a ten minute walk. The Baden-Powell House is less than a mile away. The tube puts everything else you will want to do within reach...I just cannot stress the perfect location enough!! Next - our room. Small, but clean and comfortable. Do not go there will expectations of the Holiday Inn, because European accommodations differ from what Americans are used to. If you want familiar, book a Hilton hotel. If you are after a budget conscious hotel, you will be well pleased. The bed was great, the pillows and duvet were comfy, there is a mini fridge (Note - NOT a mini bar!!) in the room, there was tons of hot water, and great water pressure in the shower, they offer a limited room service menu (LOTS of drink options, not so many food options), they have free coffee and tea in the downstairs lounge at most times, there is a hairdryer in the room, and the flatscreen TV in our room offered three channels - but who goes on holiday to watch tv anyway??? The bedspreads and towels were a bit tired and frayed, but I did not expect otherwise for the price. Contrary to other reviews, we were not plagued by bed bugs, and there were no odd smells or stains in the room. The carpets in the hallways are old and threadbare, that I will concede. We could not hear the nightclub from our 3rd floor room. We did hear our neighbour's television at six am, but he/she must have checked out that day, as we only heard it the once. I was almost dissappointed to have NOT seen the infamous Hoover in the hallway!! Breakfast - continental includes coffee/tea, juices, toast, hard boiled eggs, cold cereals, yoghurt, cheese, canned fruit, and packaged sliced ham. Meager, but acceptable. Tea/coffee is available throughout the day. Room service is limited, but available. All of the supermarket chains are within walking distance, so you can keep all sorts of supplies in your room in the mini fridge. The staff was great! All very friendly and helpful. We came and went at all times of the day/night, and all employees were always pleasant.

I read mixed reviews here on trip adviser but of course it was too late to change hotel accommodations and I just hoped for the best. My first hint that this hotel was weird was that it was the only one in the row of hotels along Trebovir street that had a neon sign while all the other hotels were much more subdued. Another hint was the coach driver who dropped me off said that this was a \"lively section of town.\" The girls who manned the front desk my entire stay were extremely nice, accommodating, and helpful in getting me adjusted to English time and various landmarks. I have nothing but high praise for these ladies and realize the faults of the hotel are not their responsibility. Upon entering my room for the first time, I noticed that it was small and stuffy. Okay, no big deal, I'm a single guy and expected a small room from the reviews I had read. I also noticed that the carpet was stained as was the comforter on my bed and the refrigerator was filthy. The bed had only one small flat pillow and I had to ball up an extra bed cover to put under the pillow to keep my head up and my neck from being strained (I have a big head, what can I say). The bathroom was surprisingly clean but at night when I went to utilize the toilet, I would turn on the light and see tiny bugs (possibly roaches) scurrying away to hide. The front door was not sealed at the bottom so there was about a 1 inch gap from the door to the floor. This created a problem mainly in that, even though these were \"No Smoking\" rooms, people smoked anyway and the smoke would creep under my door and choke me out at night. I eventually put a towel down under the door before I went to sleep which solved the problem. The phone didn't work. At least the receiver didn't. I tried to call someone twice and they couldn't hear me on the other end so I gave up on using the phone. Keep this in mind, those two uses of the phone lasted a total of only 10 seconds, 15 tops. I mention that only that you will keep it in mind at the conclusion of my review. 70% of the time my electronic key did not work in the door. I had to continuously go up and down the stairs (the elevator was out of service half the time) and get the front desk person to \"reset\" my key. Sometimes that didn't even work and the front desk person had to come up and personally open my door. The first few times it happened I brushed it off, but as it continued to be a problem, I started to get extremely annoyed. There is no \"Do Not Disturb\" door tag that you can hang on the door handle outside your room. Why is this a problem? Well, I got sick one day and was completely out of commission. Around 11:00 AM as I'm trying to catch up on sleep that being sick the night before had deprived me of, the cleaning person comes and tries to enter the room. I have the door deadbolted from the inside so she can't enter. Again, again, and again she tries then she bangs on the door. I eventually get up, open the door and politely tell her that I do not want to be disturbed. She says she HAS to clean my room. I tell her it's not necessary for that day. Luckily she was nice about it and asked if I needed anything (facial, bathroom tissue, etc...) and gave me some fresh towels. Don't count on wake up calls. There was one time that I was actually woken up on time. On the day I was checking out of the hotel, I requested a 6 a.m. wake up call. I actually woke up earlier than expected, got my things together and by the time I headed downstairs, it was 6:15 a.m. I know this because I was watching the local news and that's the time they had as well as the time I had on my watch. So much for the wake up call I was hoping to receive. So when I go to check out, I'm greeted by a man at the front desk. The fact that he was a man isn't the bad thing, I was just hoping one of the people I knew were actually helming the desk on check out. I tell him I'd like to check out, hand him my key, and ask him if that's it. Now here's where it turns shady. Remember those brief phone calls I placed and couldn't complete because the phone was broke? This guy says \"It looks like you owe 60 pounds for phone use.\" I stared at him with mouth agape. I told him that's impossible as I only used the phone twice, briefly, and that the phone was essentially useless in the room I was in. At which point he kind of nervously looks around and tells me don't worry about it. I turned and left with the sinking feeling that he was trying to rip me off. Caveat emptor everyone.

I will definitely agree with one of the former reviewers when she said to watch out for the first step out of the shower. I almost cracked my head on the mirror! But the water pressure was awesome, better than I have at home. One thing that surprised me (I haven't stayed in a hotel in London before - only lived in a flat) was that they didn't provide you with washcloths, only towels. Maybe that's a European thing, I don't know, but if that will bother you, bring your own washcloths. Also, the shampoo and soap they provide is minimal, so if you are picky bring your own. My sister and I cracked up when we walked into our \"double\" room and discovered that that meant there was one double bed. Ah well, we have slept in the same bed many times before. Surprisingly the bed was very comfortable and the covers were warm. The heat didn't appear to work the first day we were there, but from then on it was fine. We were nervous about the quality of the hairdryer they provide, but it was great. The free breakfast was an excellent value. While we were there it included sliced cheddar cheese, sliced deli ham, hardcooked eggs, cornflakes, muesli, milk, orange juice, toast and coffee or tea. The staff were very nice. When you leave the hotel for the day you have to turn in your key to the front desk. I was a little apprehensive about this but it seemed to work out. The reception is open 24 hours a day. They do offer wireless internet throughout the hotel for if you bring your laptop. There is a fee for it, but since I didn't use it, I couldn't tell you what that was. The location was excellent. Given London's superb underground system, as long as you are close to a Tube station you are set. In this case Earl's Court Tube station is literally a hop, skip and a jump away. This is great for when you are exhausted from jet lag and just want to crawl into bed after the end of a long day, instead of walking a half of a mile to your hotel. Also a bonus is that the station is handicap accessible which means that you don't have to lug your bags up multiple flights of stairs/escalators (which is not unusual depending on the Tube station in London). Another plus for location is that there is a cafe with free internet located next door to Earl's Court Tube station. It is called Cafe Milano and if you buy something there (coffee, etc.) you can use their computers upstairs for free. The computers are a bit dodgy at times but for free it's not bad.

But as mentioned elsewhere, you get what you pay for. The location is wonderful. Just be sure to exit the Earl's Court tube in the direction of the \"Earl's Court Road\" signs and NOT toward the \"Warwick\" exit, where you'll encounter stairs and more stairs, and no lift. Front desk was very friendly and helpful when in need of suggestions for a good place to eat. And honest! I needed to get on-line and the receptionist said I could use the computer in their lounge, but that the computers around the corner at the McDonald's were cheaper to use (about 2 pounds for 2 hours). Not much praise for the cleaning staff. They basically made up the bed each day the way I use to when I was 12 years old - just yanked the blankets up under the pillows. I don't think they vacuumed either, and we were there for 6 nights. And watch out for that first step out of the bathtub, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a doosey! This tub had to be at least 2 \u00c2\u00bd feet high, so make sure you stretch your legs before attempting to get in and take a shower. They have a club in the basement of this hotel, and I was awoken by one of the drunken revelers on the second night. He was literally howling in the streets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so I suggest asking for a room not facing Trebovir road. That said, if you make an effort to leave early each morning for sightseeing and return late each night after hard partying, then this hotel will work for you.

We were very lucky to have access to fresh air because of the balcony that ran along the whole second floor. However (and this is important to know), the door to the balcony didn't lock.

The hotel staff was always very polite and respectful; the toast was always plentiful at breakfast; and a clean towel was on my bed daily. But staying on the 4th floor in the front of the building was NOISY so I had to sleep with earplugs (which worked just fine!) On closer inspection, my room was just not very clean; sheets were never changed, there was garbage behind the dresser (I plugged in MY hairdryer as their's was nearly impossible to use), and they never replaced our used glassware. But the single most annoying part of my stay was the 3 GBP charge when I checked out. I couldn't imagine what it could have been for and was so surprised to find out it was for 2 diet cokes that were offered to my traveling partner and I upon our arrival (after a very long overnight flight, severe delays coming in from Heathrow on the Piccadilly line, and record-setting heat).

Our room was small but very clean and overlooked the courtyard. There are plenty of small restaurants and pubs in the neighborhood and we enjoyed sampling many of them. The front desk staff is very helpful, too. There are also several shops that offer prepared sandwiches and other items for a quick, easy meal. Of course, with the great breakfast buffet that the hotel provides, you don't need much for lunch. One caveat: My Place is not airconditioned. We stayed in May and the room was very comfortable.
