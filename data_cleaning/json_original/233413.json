We wanted something affordable, close to the train station (as we had to go to the airport the next day) and not too far from Via Veneto, Trevi and Spanish Steps. This hotel fit all those and exceeded our expectations. It is in a building with several other businesses so you do have to look for the street # before the hotel name. Once you climb one set of stairs (or take the lift) you are there. The two different front desk men we spoke to were polite, friendly, helpful and let us check in 3 hours early. The hotel is small with only 5 rooms or so and it is quet. But they give you keys to all the doors (main and hotel doors) so you can come and go at any time (which in Italy is not always the case) and they serve you breakfast in your room which consists of juice, coffee, toast and croissant. Although it is on a busy street, the windows block out all the noise. Bedrooms have a small flat screen tv, great clean and spacious bathroom. My only complaint would be that if you were staying here for a long period of time, there is very little closet space and room to store your clothes/suitcase. But for our one night stay, it was perfect! And they have free wireless, you just have to ask them for the password.", "Date": "May 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cwell located hotel\u201d", "Author": "mcwestfalls", "ReviewID": "UR49570343", "Content": "this hotel is small, clean and perfect for the tourist who plans to spend the entire day sightseeing. it is located within a five minute walk of bus lines which took us directly to the main tourist sites. the staff was very helpful in helping us get around. the continental breakfast was small, but satisfactory. i would stay there if i get the chance to go to rome again.", "Date": "November 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cBetter inside than outside\u201d", "Author": "adenny", "ReviewID": "UR8267772", "Content": "The entrance is odd in a plain building on the corner of Via Piave. There is a plaque on the wall in front that says the hotel's name. Press the button and they buzz you in. It is only one flight up to the hotel and there is an elevator but we didn't want to wait for it. Someone is always at the front desk from what I could tell. The employees are very helpful and polite. All of them speak English (some better than others.) The hotel is located right on the edge of city of Rome and not in a very touristy part. There is a Tabacco Shop across the street (you need to buy bus tickets there) and a newsstand across from that (if you buy bus tickets get a map of the bus stops here.) There are several good restaurants within the area (again it is not as touristy so the amount of English spoken varies greatly and the patience does as well.) There is a bus stop across the street that takes you to Termini station where you can catch most bus routes and if you get a handle on the map other stops nearby take you to major attractions but they don't list them as \"stop for trevi fountain\" the stops are shown by the street they let off on. The rooms are a good size and are comfortable. The street outside is noisy but miraculously the windows kept 98% of the noise out. The air conditioning didn't work the first night but as soon as we told them they had someone on it and it was fixed within a couple of hours and the rest of our stay was great. Breakfast is served when you request it. They come to your room with a tray and you eat at the small table in the room. Breakfast consisted of a crossaint, a crusty roll, yogurt, juice, tea or coffee, and some italian \"toast\" in a little package that was like a big crouton, very crunchy. Butter and jelly etc are also on the tray. I would recommend this hotel to people who want to stay somewhere nice, clean, hospitable and reasonably priced.", "Date": "July 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cRomantic B&B\u201d", "Author": "SmallWonder232", "ReviewID": "UR6909833", "Content": "My boyfriend and I are a little astonished to read the reviews. I think all of the bad reviews are from people who are accustomed to staying at the Hilton, which this is not. What it is however is very small, quaint, beautiful, b&b with lots of character. We too were a little apprehensive upon arriving as the outside of the building looked a little less inviting than expected. We made our way to the lobby and were surprised when entering as we were cheerfully greeted and the lobby was beautifully decorated and spectacularly clean. We were only booked to stay 3 nights, and asked for an additional night. The first room we stayed in was UNREAL (by unreal I mean it was clean, beautiful, nice artwork and bedspreads, with a GREAT little view). Try to ask for the 1st room, its the best one! The last night we were relocated to a different room which wasn't as pleasant (the window was unreachable). We loved our experience here, we grew quite found of the late night concierge whom we nicknamed Frankenstein (he looked and spoke like him but VERY nice). We hope he still works there. My boyfriend and I do think outside of the box. We don't care about people kissing our [--] or wi-fi internet connections. We just want real charm (aside from what my vocabulary may allude to). I would recommend this place to almost anyone. But like I said before, try to stay in the very 1st room, most likely room #1. Its the best room in the joint. Also, a great location, bank is right across the way. Bring your walking shoes there is a lot in the big city to see. Don't bring travelers checks, they stink and no one takes them.", "Date": "March 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monza", "Title": "\u201cAverage stay\u201d", "Author": "LeleSorcha", "ReviewID": "UR5968758", "Content": "This is not really a hotel - more like a B&B.

First thing is that you can easily walk from the Termini without getting on the metro. Start as you mean to go on as you will be doing alot of walking! When we arrived we got the lift up to the first floor (the only time we actually used it!). Yes it is old and the bell is annoying but hey, when in Rome!! The hotel is very small, only 6 bedrooms so don't expect anything on a grand scale. Saying that, when we arrived (around 12.30pm) we were shown to a twin-bedded room. When we asked if we could have a double they immediately showed us to another room. Only downside to this room was that the window was about 12 foot off the ground so no view at all unless you are a basketball player!! Also the air-con didn't work but both of these were not big problems. Bathroom was more than adequate with a shower etc with hot water on demand. Breakfast was ok, croissants, sweet rolls and dried toast, jams and butter choice of tea or coffee. Set us up nicely for the day. The hotel is pretty central and the buses are brilliant. I would not say it is really near to any of the major sites but everywhere is so easily accessable, no more than 30 mins walk or 10 mins bus ride.

After further searching in the hotel's ledger, the receptionist found our information. But said there was no room available and sent us to another hotel several blocks away. She was very rude and insisted there was no problem. She said the hotel has several sister properties in the area and that we would be booked at one of them. When we arrived at our new hotel, the receptionist there had no record of our reservation and told us they were not at all associated with Locanda. After much fustration and a few phone calls back and forth, we ended up getting Locanda to pay for the room at the new hotel. While we never saw a room at Locanda, we did find it very odd that the hotel has no signage out front, and that it is basically located in some sort of office/apartment building. The lobby was little more than a small office on the second floor of this seedy building.
