The mattress and box spring were both covered with a removable and washable cover to prevent infestations and I could tell that it was brand new. The carpet and bathroom flooring was clean and not sticky or damp ( I hate that). For a motel the room had a fridge that was not tiny and the bathroom was acceptable size. The staff was very helpful and would not accept tips (We tipped anyways :)) CON: There are no beach front views from the rooms although it is on the boardwalk, so be careful when you see beach front listed (They do however have a veranda in front of the building).

At Safari, the usual amenities that we have all become accustomed to during our travels, are absent.

It did its purpose, and I really remember this being a clean place to stay for being a motel (not big on motels) when we go to the hotel it was a bit after 3 on Monday, we checked in. When I reserved the room online from their website, I requested the main building and a non animal room. I got the complete opposite. Okay thats fine Ill deal. Get to the 2nd builidng room and it spelt freshly clean (AWESOME!) but I did not want that building (being two younger girls not very safe) look around everything was ncie, but still not happy... Look up at the wall and the smoke detector was pulled out of the wall. That was the last straw. Went to the front desk, advised them of my request and the fact that there is no smoke detector and ask him for a room in the main building and he could not provide as they were full, I then ask for atleast a smoke detector and he was going to give it to me, he then was somehow able to find a room in the main building(since he could not provide a detector). we get in that room, and it smelt of pee/mustiness.

I looked online and only two hotels were showing availability, one of which was the Safari Motel. The Safari was on the boardwalk whereas the other one was a mile away. Easy decision. The room was $230 plus tax which seemed reasonable for an oceanfront hotel at the last minute. I had read some reviews on TripAdvisor that suggested the hotel was old but not terrible, and that the service was excellent. We took a shot and booked the room online, got a confirmation number, packed our stuff into the car, and went. PARKING When you initially arrive, you pull into a little half-circle adjacent to the lobby. It's large enough for two cars or so. This is not a busy area of the street and is right in front of the boardwalk. Once you've checked in, you move your car behind the main building or to the side of the second building in a dedicated lot for the motel. You get a little piece of paper indicating that you are a guest. The nice thing is that the motel lets you keep the parking spot for the entire day after check-out. CHECK-IN We arrived at 10:15 PM. My kids were asleep in the car, so I left hubby in the car with them and went to check in. The guy manning the desk was friendly enough, but when I gave my name, he tells me, \"I tried to call you. We don't have a room for you. There was a glitch in the system, I don't know how, I tried to get Expedia to call you but they said they wouldn't. I feel bad.\" He goes on for 10 minutes about how this isn't the motel's fault, that Expedia has bad practices, etc. I show him the confirmation information, I tell him that we drove 3 hours to get there, and it's now 10:15 at night with no rooms anywhere else. He says that he DOES have a room for me, after all, but it needs housekeeping first. By this point, I'm too tired to argue and just ask when we can get into the room. He says \"10:30 maybe.\" I go park the van and we decide to wake the kids and walk the boardwalk a little bit. It's a nice night, not chilly, and we figured it would be an adventure. THE ROOM We finally get into the room and I am in shock. Maybe I've been spoiled by all the other hotels (anywhere. ever.), but this room reeks of febreeze, the tile floor is gritty with sand, and everything is mismatched and worn down. It's *not* charmingly mismatched or lovingly kept. This is a random mash-up of furnishings, bedding, and decor. On the plus side, the bathroom (while old) is SPOTLESS. There is no grime, no nothing, in the bathroom. This is a redeeming factor. Also, the window-unit air conditioner seems to work well enough although unfortunately it's not loud enough to drown out the unhappy couple fighting viciously in the courtyard below our room. Mind you, it's 10:45 so we pray that there are no bedbugs and go to sleep, hoping things will seem better in the morning. (They don't). LOCATION The motel is directly on the boardwalk and it's nowhere near the pier, crazy crowds, amusement park, etc. Which, in my opinion, is a plus. The beach area in front of the hotel was not packed even though it was Memorial Day. This part of the strip was quieter and relaxed. We thought the location was fabulous. We did walk as a family all the way down to the pier and back, and it wasn't a strenuous walk. We enjoyed it. There is a tram that will take you up and back for a nominal fee, if you don't want to walk. SERVICES Apparently the lobby serves coffee but no one in my family drinks it, so we didn't partake. Otherwise, I don't think there are any services available. There is no restaurant on property, not that it matters, since OC has tons of food options all around. CONCLUSION In fairness to the motel, they don't claim to be new or fancy. Their claim to fame is purely their location and the (relative) cheap cost. Maybe I'm a snob, but I had low expectations coming in and they couldn't even meet those. I don't care if there's a \"glitch\" in the reservation system. I made a reservation properly, I got a proper confirmation, and I expected a room. While I'm of course happy that they \"found\" me a room, I was really unhappy with how somehow I was made to feel anxious and defensive upon arrival and that I should be grateful that I was getting a room at all. Would we stay here again? No, we wouldn't.", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat location,very clean and friendly staff!\u201d", "Author": "EllenChicago", "ReviewID": "UR133393020", "Content": "The hotel is right on the boardwalk, which was very convenient for the week that we stayed there.

We drove to OC, MD late on friday. Arrived without any reservations anywhere. Tried several different hotels and came upon this one. At approximately 1am, we go to the lobby with the full-on 1970's safari theme and incense burning. At least the smell of incense. Now I'm not super Old school but there are generally only 2 reasons why people burn incense. (1) Everyone always thinks incense covers up the smell of illegle things burning. It doesn't, nor am i accusing this establishment of such and (2) the a bad smell created by humans. Whatever was going on it should have caused us pause before we secured a room. Unfortunately, we are exhausted and just wanted to lie down. We did ask to just peep at the room before we unload. The front desk guy gladly showed us to the room. We took an awfully rickity elevator up to the 3rd floor. Upon exit we notice the door to the fire escape was WIDE OPEN! Yep, wide open. I suppose this helps to air out the musty smell of this hotel. Front desk guys has the nerve to show us to the fire escape because this is where we have a good view of the parking lot in which we should have parked. Convenient! Any any other bum on the street can also come right on up to our floor and take a nap in the hallway! Awesome! Then he takes us to the other end of the hallway to see the shared balcony. Overlooking the boardwalk and leaning so terribly, I was afraid to stay out there any longer. Next, the room. you open it up with a key. Nope not the electronic type key, but an actual metal old school tumbler type key. Now I'm feeling really safe. We go to the room and see 2 double beds. I was afraid to sit on them. Then the ultimate kicker...the bathroom! Circa 1963, it was a deep sky blue! All of it! And there was also a lovely hair in the sink! Yes this place was nasty. Needless to say, we did not stay.

We chose the Safari motel after reading on the message boards that they were pet friendly and our usual spot (Barefoot Mailman) was under new management. When we reserved there was a disclaimer that pets must be under 25 lbs but when we called they said it was not an issue to bring our definitely larger than 25 lb Golden Retriever. The location for Safari Motel is ideal. It is right in the middle of the boardwalk. You can walk north for about 15 blocks where it is a bit calmer or 15 block south toward the hustle and bustling inlet. There are 2 buildings for Safari Motel - the main building and another one across the alley. We stayed in the blue building across the alley. Amenities wise, Safari is basic. There is no pool, no continental breakfast, no Internet access, window unit AC, and small 19\" CRT TVs. The room we were in did have a microwave and mini fridge. We stayed in a double room, which was surprisingly clean considering the age of the place. As with much at the Safari, the furnishings seemed old and could use an update. The beds were of average comfort and water pressure was sufficient. Our room (#34) had a few minor issues - the remote for the TV didn't work great (had to mash the buttons down) and the bathroom door did not fully close (see picture). Parking was fine for the Easter weekend. There are approximately 6 spots in front of the blue building as well as a larger lot next to the building. I can see that during the peak season it may get a little tight though. The front desk staff was friendly. Maid service came but but they didn't do a very good job. They tossed the soap that we were using and only left 1 bar (for hand washing and showering), did not leave an extra TP and tossed out the left over dog food left in my dog's bowl.

We came in and were told to go outside and \"wash the sand off of our feet\". Our old fashioned key wouldn't open our room door so we went for help, We were told that our key had sand on it and that is why it wouldn't work.

I was shown my choice of rooms in person and picked the room that best fit our needs. The room I chose was out dated, but super clean. The rooms in the main building were very nice but close to the office and I knew our dog would bark. The location is wonderful, the rooms clean and the staff very friendly and helpful. Check in was very quick, check out consisted of handing them a key. If you are looking for frills, this is not the hotel for you. If you are a pet owner, this is a clean accommodation for you and fido.

All of his clothes were wet and we had to dry them on the heaters. When the people above us used their showers, we realized this was when we could look forward to the drips and leaks. The floors were wet throughout the entire room which was DISGUSTING!!! We always wore our shoes in the room. The electrical outlets on one entire wall of the room would not work (the same wall where the main leaking was located).
