The rooms are very clean and modern as is the common area of the hotel. The shower is great - consistent, good pressure and temperature. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Breakfasts were a little different for the non Spanish palate (I am fairly adventurous with food!), but in addition to the items which seemed unusual, cerals, toast and eggs were also available. Certainly enough to fill up on! The hotel is on the edge of the city center, and is within easy walking distance of the Royal Palace and the Cathedral.

Easy to access from the airport with minimal train jumping, and did I say awesome service? Because it was.

The nearest metro satation is a 10 min walk away. There are other places one can stay at for a little less, that are in the middle of things. I stayed later at a hostal in la Latina, and I missed the comfort of Hotel Suites Viena, but not the location. I felt hotel Viena itself was very quiet, but every night, noise would come up from the street below, one night there was even a scuffle between two drunk kids outside, which fortunately was of no consequence, but the noise did reach up to the 5th floor. I think the area is pretty safe, looking down at night I could see poeple walking alone, women even, at 2 or 3 in the morning.

Close to 2 metros, Plaza de Espana, Gran Via, Palace (all within a 5 - 10 minute walk). The street is also relatively quiet so we had a peaceful night's sleep. - Staff. All very friendly and helpful. Service with a smile :-) - Rooms. Free wifi, clean, large, had a kitchenette and eating area so we could prepare our own food - Room service. As it's a smaller hotel it doesn't have a massive kitchen so they outsource their room service to 2 local restaurants. Great idea! You pay the price of a delivery. You can have something from a German/Viennese style restaurant or a sushi restaurant. Not Spanish but after 2 weeks of non stop Spanish, I was gagging for sushi! - Breakfast.

Our first stop was Madrid and based on the glowing reviews I booked 2 nights here. Check in was easy and the room was modern and clean. The bathroom was tight, but having traveled through Europe before I was half expecting this. No big deal though. The hotel is really close to Templo Deblod and Plaza Espanya. Its also close to the Palacio Real. For the most part, my mom and I walked everywhere, even walked all the way to Parque de Retiro. We chose to have breakfast at the hotel one morning as they were running a special - breakfast for 2 for 13 Euros. The breakfast was adequate with some small ham and cheese sandwiches, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, french toast and an assortment of pastries and juices as well as coffee. I thought it was pretty good. I was super happy with the choice of hotel up until our first evening. Our room faced the street and we were up 3 floors. I was woken up at about 2 am with loads of screaming drunken people on the street. Even with the windows completely closed, it wouldn't have made any difference if the windows were open, it was that loud. Now, I can't blame the hotel for people deciding to scream at the top of their lungs, but perhaps do something to soundproof the windows a little bit. And then here's where it goes downhill...we were a little chilly so I pulled the blanket out of the closet. As I was falling asleep my mom mentioned an ant on the cover. I was 1/2 asleep and didn't think much of it. Well, I wake up and while my mom is showering, I'm sitting up and looking down - it was no ant. It was a bedbug. I immediately threw the blanket off and threw it back in the closet. Took a hot shower and put everything that we had been wearing in a plastic bag and tied it, then put it in another plastic bag. I contacted the woman at the front desk and you could tell she was super apologetic. I told them to change all the sheets/towels and remove the blanket. Later that afternoon when we returned, I closely examined the bed and found nothing.

The mattresses were firm and extremly comfortable. The sheets were always crisp and clean. The towels were perfect! There are loads of TV stations for when you chilling in the room prior to going to sleep, but all of the English channels are of news programs. If you head down to the Temple Debod and hang a right, there are about 5 or 6 restaurants, including an Irish pub, in the area. It is easily accessible to the \"riverwalk\" for runners!

Breakfast: We ate the buffet breakfast at the hotel only once. There is plenty to choose from though the quality and freshness is a bit underwhelming. The Cuban lady that serves breakfast is chock full of information (i.e. if you speak Spanish). We also found a nearby restaurant named Cascaras which serves breakfast Madrid style -- we loved the whole-wheat croissants (croissants integral, in local vernacular). Rooms: Rooms were nice but sterile. A small kitchen comes with it but the refrigerator is full of mini-bar items so you can't really use it too much. If you plan to use the cooktop or microwave you have to ask the front desk for utensils. Room did not have a coffee-maker but you can go to the lounge and get some for 1.60 Euros.

I read many reviews right here on tripadvisor and decided to give Hotel Suites Viena a try. I was not disappointed in the least. The hotel is situated a few hundred meters from two different metro stations - Plaza de Espana or Ventura Rodriguez. Each only a few minutes walk. Additionally, the hotel is within a very quiet neighborhood but close to a variety of eating establishments and even a Starbucks for those who need that morning cup of coffee. Upon check in, I found the staff to be extremely helpful and kind. As a non-Spanish speaking person, I found the staff's command of the English to be flawless. The rooms are simplistic and modern. To be honest, the one I stayed in was the largest and most comfortable room I have been in yet during any of my trips to Madrid. This includes 5-Star hotels such as the Miguel Angel! My room included a small strove top, microwave and sink if I ever felt the need to use them (I did not). Wireless internet was also available for free within my room as well. Again, something I have not had in any other hotel in Madrid! The bottom line is this, I cannot recommend any hight the Hotel Suites Viena! From now on, I will be staying here for all my trips to Madrid!", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bedford", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, good value\u201d", "Author": "beckyb78", "ReviewID": "UR110435362", "Content": "Stayed for 3 nights in May and was very pleased with the location (only 5mins walk to the palace and old town), room (was clean and air con worked well), staff (they were friendly and helpful).

The noise level was also alright but if you are really adverse to noise please ask for a room away from the school close by. It did not particularly bother me but I could see how it might for some.

However, it is a neighborhood with local shops and madrilenos going about their daily life.

Out junior suite was nice - large room and terrace, thought bathroom was a little on the small side. It could be better if a few details were addressed: - Our TV took around 3 minutes to come on every time we tried to use it - The speaker in the bathroom which was supposed to relay the sound from the TV didn't work - There were mucky handprints on the bathroom ceiling where workmen had obviously had to remove the tiles for maintenance - The hotel doesn't provide cutlery, plates etc automatically - you have to ask for these, which I think is silly and isn't the way most apart/suite hotels work Those are very minor niggles, I appreciate, but they do niggle and are preventing this hotel from getting a 5/5 from ourselves. The area is lovely - it reminded us a lot of the nicer parts of Charlottenburg in Berlin. It's dead easy to reach the two metro stops, or the cable car.

Good places to eat on the Rosales at night too, and a great Ice Cream Shop (Bruin) near the cable car, too. The only other downside of our stay was at check out when a lady's handbag was stolen.

The neighborhood is very quiet, but a quick walk to food (Gran Via) and happenings. The rooms in this hotel are huge, especially by European standards. Actually, they're pretty comfortable by American standards as well. The hotel has embraced energy reduction by requiring your room key to also operate the electricity in the room. This is done by having the key loaded in a key slot on the entry hall wall. The downside to this is that there is no clock in the room. Also, the king size bed situation is two twin beds, made up separately, tight enough for a quarter to bounce off and go through the ceiling, and pushed together on a king size frame. The mattress is like sleeping on a cinder block. Suggestion to the hotel: please purchase a few true King Size mattresses and a soft mattress pad to boot. It would kick up the ratings on this hotel another notch for sure!! There is a mini kitchenette, but I found it almost a waste of space in that there is no cookery to actually use it. Also, there is no iron, not just unavailable in the room, but unavailable in the entire hotel. (I've been informed from other this is the norm throughout Spain). Travel with one if needed. (Very pricey to have the hotel iron a shirt for you). The free internet use in the lobby was excellent and the front desk was always helpful with any question/issue we had. Like others posted, the hotel breakfast is overpriced. BUT, Americans beware, there is not a scrambled egg to be had anywhere nearby (atleast that we could find for 4 days straight).

Actually I cannot imagine staying near Sol or Plaza Mayor where music bands playing until midnight. The Debod temple is just one block away (a must see in Madrid) and Palacio Real is accessible in less than 10 minutes. Rooms are big with enough space for baggage, although it is lengthy and narrow. Rooms are furnished with Two sofas, one small table, one chair, a desk, a wrack of 12 clothes hangers, Laptop size safe and a small kitchen. The main positive point about Hotel is cleanness.

It is tucked away down a side street away from the noise of the hustle and bustle of the centre, but close to the centre to be able to enjoy it. The hotel its self is brilliant. The rooms are very clean and are cleaned every day, it was great going out for the day and coming back to a fresh clean room. The staff are very helpful and very nice. The whole of the hotel is just spotless! There was three of us sharing a room, 1 double and 1 single. There was a little kitchenette, but you have to ask for the untensils etc. The kitchen comprised of 2 ring top cooker, a microwave, sink, a fridge that had a mini bar ( that was expensive to use) we just brought our own stuff and put in the fridge, they don't mind you using it. The bathroom was long and narrow but it was okay and very clean. Towels were changed every day. The shower was a power shower. We were very close to the centre. Metros are so easy to get on and off. From Barajas airport to plaza espana will cost 2euros because you have to pay a suppliment. However to get around from A - B it just cost a euro no matter where you go around the city. The metro is so clean and cool. There is a big TV in the middle of the tracks to entertain the public while waiting for the metro. You don't have to have wait for long though. There is no pushing and shoving on them either, as there is always plenty of room. For you are eating out, it can be very expensive, especially if you want to eat outside, you pay almost double to what is advertised. If you go to the Plaza Mayor you can have a 'bocadillo de calamares' (A baguette filled with calamares) or spanish omelete, or ham and a beer or soft drink for 4 euros. The plaza mayor is a place to visit. A beautiful square with little street cafes around the outside, painters, and street entertainers. Well worth sitting out side just to take in the atmosphere of it all. The buildings in madrid are fantastic. The royal palace and the cathedral are just a short walk from the hotel. It is fantastic, the building is just so breath taking and to be able to walk so close to it was amazing. It was lovely day or night walking around. There is a park straight opposite, el jardin del oriente, with plenty of seats to sit down and trees and bushes, amazing statues stand high on pedel stools. Street cafes sit around the outside of the park. There is also a park very close to the hotel one to the side, plaza espana and another one opposite with another park in the inside with prize winning roses. Well worth a walk round. If you are going to do some catering, recommend the DIA supermarket very cheap and is just round the corner and down the road from the hotel. We had breakfast at el cortes ingles, as it was cheaper than the hotel. The hotel charged us 10 euros each, in el cortes ingles 3 coffees, churros (fried dough), 2 toasted baguettes with butter and jam and freshly squeezed oranged juice (3 glasses) served at your table with waiters in black and white suites who are so very nice, for just 7 euros for the three of us. The only thing is that it doesn't open until 10am. We did find another little cafe Nabraska which is just up the road from the cafe and they were open very early. Also very nice with uniformed staff just willing to help you. We had the same there, 1 coffee and churros is only 2euros 30 cents! cheaper than a cup of coffee than costas in britain. We found no matter where we went for a coffee, the coffees were just so nice, tasted of coffee, and were so cheap, about a 1.60 euro a cup. When every you order a beer and soft drinks, they bring you little tapas with it. We have had bowls of crisps, olives and tuna and peppers on little tiny pieces of bread. We had that every where we went. We went to central Madrid to see the museum, The buildings again makes you want to walk around with your head up in the air. They are just so fantatic. The Prado Museum was brilliant. It costs 7 Euros each, however, if you have a student card you can get in for 4 euros and if you are an OAP. In the evenings you can get in for free between 6-8pm. Well worth a visit. There is tight security when you go in, your bags are put into an xray machine. The Retiro park opposite the museum is a great place for a walk round. You could be there for hours though it is so big. Very beautiful park, very green, lakes and lots of play areas for all sorts of ages, from the tiny weenies with a giant sand pit and swings and slides for them, to juniors and also an adult play area with exercise bars etc. There was quite a few people using them! There is the cristal palace in the centre with a large lake, full of fish, large ones! and also terripins, loads of them! ducks and swans too, beautiful brown ducks and a beautiful black swan! There is a big boating lake in the middle of the park. On the whole Madrid and the Suites Viena is well worth going to. The weather was very hot, 38C some days, but it didn't feel stuffy or sweaty, you can easily walk around in it all day long, as long as you drink plenty of water.

It\u2019s a fairly new six storey building comprising 50 studios, 5 junior suites and 2 senior suites. We treated ourselves to one of the junior suites for a long weekend over May Day and were not disappointed, even though we ended up close to the road on the first floor, (we prefer rooms on higher floors if possible). The hotel is located only 100+ yards up from Plaza Espana but it\u2019s unbelievably quiet for the centre of a major city. This more than compensates for the fact it\u2019s not a very pretty road. Luckily, most of the traffic uses neighbouring through roads. Even the school playground opposite did not bother us as we slept in to well past 9:00am every morning! Our junior suite was clean, light and airy, and uncluttered, with a fully tiled bathroom and laminate flooring elsewhere. Looking at the floor plan on the back of our door, it was about double the size of the studios, (which most reviewers seem to think are themselves quite spacious), with a separate bedroom that has a huge walk in wardrobe. All rooms have a lounge area and a kitchenette with sink, electric rings, microwave and minibar/fridge, but you will have to ask for things like kettle, cups etc if you want to use the facilities. There was a nice LCD TV in the lounge area and another in the bedroom, but only two English language news stations. Breakfast, which is served until 10.30am weekdays and 11.00am weekends was included at a discounted rate by the online hotel agents we used. We don\u2019t think we would have paid full price if we had not booked in advance, but for us there was a reasonable choice to start the day, even though the scrambled eggs tended to remain empty once they were gone. If you arrive by air you can catch Line 8 metro down to Nuevo Minesterios where you need to change to Line 10, which will take you to Plaza Espana. The hotel is about 5 minutes from the station. A single ticket from the airport is 2\u20ac including the 1\u20ac airport surcharge. Ventura Rodriguez station on Line 3 is slightly closer but not worth the extra metro change with luggage. If, like us, you are not a fan of other people\u2019s cigarette smoke, you may find it difficult to identify somewhere to eat in Madrid that is smoke free. Apparently, a bill to introduce a public places smoking ban at a future date is expected soon. In the meantime, you could consult the nofumadores.org website which lists non smoking establishments.

Plenty of small cafes nearby. We really liked the tapas bar on the corner (above the hotel). A selection of fun tapas for 2 euros, plus great sangria. Room was generous, but bed was hard. Didn't bother us too much. Because Spain is a late-night country, there is always noise on the street at night, precluding leaving your windows open (and why doesn't anyone in Europe use screens....). We had some \"borrachos\" (drunks) on the street walking by,2 or 3 of the 5 nights we were there. It wasn't specific to the hotel. Also, don't plan on sleeping in (you should be out exploring anyway) during the week, because there is a grammar school across the street whose playground gets noisy by about 10 a.m. Some typical lacks for an American: no tissues and no wash cloths or dish cloths for the kitchenette. By the way, you have to ask for the dishes/pots/pans etc at the front desk, as they are not stocked in the kitchenette. We booked through Hotels.com and got quite a good rate, but it did not include breakfast. There are a number of shops with a couple of block that sell breakfast sandwiches, which you can buy the night before and stick in the frig and then microwave. About 2 1/2 euros apiece. With a kitchenette, full breakfast not really necessary. Our only major complaint was that they didn't notify us in any way of the time change, so we were an hour early for a tour we had booked. When we asked, they said it never occurred to them that anyone wouldn't know.

We always managed to get connected but local only, no Internet. The receptionist gave us different cables and a different room to try but without success. They then tried to say it was our computer which we challenged since we successfully connected in many many other hotels. Then one night around 9pm I switched on the computer to do some work offline and it connected to Wifi!!!!! We were connected for about an hour before losing the connection. I really suspect that bandwidth was the issue, but they market Internet access in every room. The hotel is within the hop-on hop-off bus route, so if you turn left out of the hotel, take the first left then cross the road at the end the bus stop is right there close to the bottom of the steps to Temple Debod. You should walk up to the temple, and visit it, then walk to the end of the park where you get a good view of part of the city. The hop on-off bus was a good way to get an overview of the city.

My room faced the street, and there's a big excavation project of some kind going on across from the hotel which commenced around 7AM.

The hotel has complimentary internet access on a computer in reception, and also a free wired broadband connection in every room (ask at reception for the cable). A breakfast buffet is served every morning from 7am - 11am, and although expensive at 12 Euros each, it is well worth it.

Indeed, the breakfast was so good, we didn't need any lunch, so it proved to be quite an economical option! A good tip whilst staying here is to take a quick walk (less than 5 minutes) round the corner to the Templo de Debod, in the Parque Del Oeste. There is an amazing view of the Royal Palace and the Cathedral from the edge of the park.

It's an easy 2 block walk with rolling luggage from the Plaza Espana metro station to the hotel. Our room overlooked a quiet side street that dead ends into the Plaza so not much traffic. The elementary school across the street reverberates with happy playing children at recess times, but that's fairly brief & easy to tolerate unless you like to sleep past 9AM. Ask for a room on the back side if you want quiet. Front desk check-in was quick & easy with the staff speaking fluent English. If you request when confirming your reservation cooking utensile will be in your kitchenette. Ours included a fry pan & expresso pot, dishes, cutlery, & the ever important corkscrew, can opener, etc. The frig was stocked as a mini-bar, but we could remove things to make space for our perishables. A gourmet grocery & deli with fresh fruit, cheeses, wine, bakery & take out dinners is about 4 blocks away in the ground level of the huge \"El Cortez Ingles\" department. store at C. de la Princessa.& Ventura Rodriguez. \"Dia\" a neighborhood grocery is a block away with cheaper prices. The hotel offers a substantial breakfast buffet for a fee, but we opted to cook breakfast since our jet-lagged bodies demanded food at odd hours. True, the bathroom is small.......but everything was in excellent condition and very clean. The kitchenette was also spotless. There's a safe for valuables. The minimalist decor that is so popular in Spain it a bit sparan for my taste........but the furnishings & linens were nicely coordinated and of good quality. The bed was hard for my taste...pillow-top mattresses don't seem to be the fashion in Spain where they believe in the \"orthopedic\" mattress. The bare Pergo floors were warmer than I expected in November. And the big window swings open for fresh air. The TV had only one English channel (BBC) but we got a kick out of watching favorite American cartoon characters speaking German or Spanish. Travel should be educational after all. The Palacio de la Real and Cathedral de la Almudena are about 3/4 mile walk from the hotel. All the sights of \"old Madrid\" in Plaza del Sol and Plaza Mayor are just a two metro stops away. We felt very safe walking everywhere in this primarily residential neighborhood. Our son was studying in Madrid, so we celebrated Thankgiving at \"Cascaras\" a tapas and wine bar a few blocks from the hotel. The only poultry on their menu was Pheasant Salad....so we indulged on our last night in Spain. We were so satisfied with the Hotel Suites Vienas for the first 4 nights or our trip that we returned for the final night of our trip before flying out of Madrid. I recommend this hotel to independent travelers who don't want a lot of personal service and like the option to collapse and \"eat in\" after a long day of sightseeing. Tip: Buy the 10 ride Metro pass. It can be shared by two people and you can get around the city like the Madrilenos without wasting your precious vacation time in traffic jams. Get a map of the city with the metro routes from the Tourist office in Barajas airport (next to the metro station) and you will be good to go. There's a 1 Euro surcharge to exit from the metro station into the airport......save a Euro coin to purchase that supplemental ticket.", "Date": "February 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cirencester, England", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value\u201d", "Author": "PeterBeard", "ReviewID": "UR21102985", "Content": "Good location, smart and modern, quite quiet, large room (but small bathroom), good (if pricey) breakfast, newspapers included the FT, reasonably priced minibar, helpful staff.", "Date": "October 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood location and clean\u201d", "Author": "SquirrelMinx", "ReviewID": "UR20511350", "Content": "This apartment hotel is conveniently situated near Placa Espana, Opera and close to the metro.

Only 1 euro for a small beer or glass of wine and you get some tapas too! in this little bar were locals meet. We enjoyed our stay here very much and was perfect for us.

I can only assume that the 3-star status is due to the fact that it's a limited service hotel (i.e. there's no bar, restaurant etc.) as the quality and comfort of the surroundings definitely deserve a higher rating. Also, the quiet location a minutes walk from the Plaza de Espana was ideal as it gave quick access to the centre of Madrid while also providing an escape from the crowds. There are a number of bars, restaurants and grocery shops nearby so you won't go hungry - for the less adventurous, there's also a Starbucks and some well-known fast food outlets a couple of blocks away! I spent a little extra and booked one of the junior suites (room 603) with terrace, and I feel it was worth the money. The room itself was very spacious and the furnishings comfortable; although the huge bed was indeed two smaller (yet full-size) beds put together, the 'join' could barely be felt. The terrace was a great bonus, providing a private space to enjoy the last of the days warmth while relaxing before heading out for the evening. As a previous reviewer mentioned you can't really do much with the small kitchen area, but having the fridge was useful (it includes some mini-bar items) and I'm sure the microwave would come in handy for some. There's also a room service facility in the form of a menu from a local restaurant - they deliver direct to your room, and the pizza is lovely! The hotel provides breakfast too; its quite basic but enough to keep you going til lunch. Having said that, as I'd booked through the hotels own website it was included in the rate; I wouldn't have paid the 12 Euros for it otherwise. The hotel is also close to good transport links - bus and metro - that make it easy to get around lovely Madrid when your feet can't take any more. The 'Madrid Vision' tour bus has a stop just a block away too. As for getting to the hotel a taxi from the airport cost 25 Euros, which seemed reasonable given the volume of traffic and the time it took, while on the way home I decided to try the AeroCity shuttle service at 20 Euros - I was picked up exactly on time, and the poor driver performed a minor miracle in managing to pick up the next clients AND get us all to the airport on time, given we got caught up in some kind of demonstration in the Puerta del Sol! Madrid is an amazing place on all sorts of levels and I know I'll be going back soon. While I appreciate that limited service hotels won't be to everyone's taste, and although it's far removed from some of the spectacular 'traditional' hotels in the city, I can't imagine finding a more convenient and comfortable place from which to enjoy Madrid than Suites Viena.", "Date": "November 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, the Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGood location, clean, modern & new, great balcony!\u201d", "Author": "1972", "ReviewID": "UR7707627", "Content": "I stayed 5 nights at Sercotel Suites Viena in Madrid. Unfortunately the wheather was terrible, the city was flooded and our spacious balcony / terrace ( 4 chairs+ table, 20 square meters) remained just a reminder that the Madrid has good wheather too... We paid an extra 20 euro's per night to upgrade to a suite since they didn't offer regular rooms with a balcony. The suite is a good size with plenty of storage space. The bathroom is small (1 basin, bath and wc) but clean. A kitchenette in the sitting area with a small fridge/freezer, microwave and 2 burners. You will need assistance from the receptionist to get kitchen utensils (a pot to boil water for tea f.i.) and to switch on the main plug for the kitchen appliances. You'll be able to make breakfast and nescaf\u00e9, but with just 1 pan, don't expect to do much cooking. The staff is helpful and friendly. They provided umbrellas (much needed) and wheather reports (bad news). The airconditioning/heating, the laminate floor, the blackout curtains, the good-sized bed and comfortable modern furniture made our stay a very comfortable one (despite the endless rainstorms). I would recommend this hotel to anyone for any purpose: business (good desk and free wifi), family (kitchenette= ideal with children, quiet and safe location) or citybreak (near royal palace and bike rental next door).", "Date": "May 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampshire, UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent, quiet location\u201d", "Author": "grafran", "ReviewID": "UR7566310", "Content": "The hotel is very well located in a quiet street, close to Plaza de Espana & Ventura Rodriguez metro stations.
