If you have guest from all over the world make them comfortable in every way and don't take advantage financially because of the passport they hold. The beds are horrible and I thought I seen them throwing away mattresses wonder why? This is located next to airport this is the only convenience and I highly recommend that you don't use the market across the street, the prices change at the register and they don't even care that you can prove what the price is even if its on the product itself you will be robbed blind.

My 9 yr old sister and my mother with ill health had to endure the suffering from the events at this ridiculous hotel. On the first night we stayed in room numbers: 115, 116 and 117 - 6 family members in total. This is one floor above what is called the Mezanine floor. Apparently it\u2019s a night club and the loud music goes on until 3am every night. Little did we know we were going to spend the night in a night club. The loud music initially I assumed was from neighbouring room as you could feel the vibration too. When I rang reception at 2.30am, they didn\u2019t admit that there is a disco venue directly below us. They said they will send someone to take care of the problem. However, at 3.25am I rang again. This time the security personnel that attended my query informed me that there is a dance event one floor below. I went to the Shift manager the following morning and demanded an explanation. He was apologetic and offered me a room on the top floor. I asked if he could put it in writing about the noise we suffered so that I could provide lastminute.com with this. He was reluctant but took us to the General Managers room. The General Manager \u2013 Mr Praveen Nanda was instantly defensive and kept repeating that we paid for a Standard Room and that the noise is expected in standard rooms and that he will move us to the top floor. I explained that whether standard room or not, lodgers ought to be able to sleep at night. Not have to stay awake till 3.30am. But he was very aggressive and rude. He raised his voice and said that we can leave the hotel now and he will give us a letter to show lastminute.com that we only stayed one night. But he wont provide us with a letter regarding the noise we had to tolerate. For your information, if you look at the booking printout, it says we booked a superior room. How distressing and inconsiderate. Now, are we to spend the day looking for another hotel and also pay out of pocket since we had prepaid this hotel? I was appalled at his behaviour. This sort of behaviour and experience is not expected from a 4 Star Hotel. He didn\u2019t provide us with a letter to say we experienced noise. Instead, gave us his business card as proof that we have had a discussion with him. He said the Agents are aware of what they sell so we should have been informed while booking the rooms. Eventually when we were moved to another floor, it wasn\u2019t the top floor. It was one floor above the one we stayed at. The bell boy carrying the bags asked why we were moving. I explained the ridiculous noise. He said this occurs every night. He was very correct. That night again we suffered noise till 3am but it wasn\u2019t as loud as the previous night.", "Date": "November 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "usa", "Title": "\u201cVery helfull staff and comfortable hotel\u201d", "Author": "luckall", "ReviewID": "UR40516841", "Content": "We had an early flight and thus came to the hotel at 6am.They were full but made us comfortable in the lobby,offered tea/coffee and were able to give us a room in 30 minutes.I had read mixed reviews and so was aprihensive but must say they are a good hotel traveller friendly.The breakfast is amazing and roomservice was very fast.Wifi in the rooms helped us stay in touch with our office.Theyy have a shuttle to malls and becomes very cost effective.value for money,higly recommended", "Date": "September 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cNot To Be Recommended\u201d", "Author": "garner", "ReviewID": "UR24435505", "Content": "Stayed one night at this hotel prior to early flight following day from Dubai airport.

By 8.30am we had our rooms. Our room was large with comfortable beds (2 singles in our room, our friends had a double) flat screen Tv, mini bar and clean bathroom, hot water and good shower. The bathroom defintly had a strange wiff of curry but this wasnt really an issue. The breakfast was ok with choice of tea, coffee, juices plus eggs, beans and sausages, omlette chef. cereals and yogurts An Indian style spicy breakfast was also available. A negative point about this hotel was the expensive internet, at 3 pounds for a half hour this is a rip off. The location is very near the airport so its quite far from the souks and malls however unlike most things in Dubai. the cabs are still a bargain. Our first trip to Dubai was 4 years ago and we stayed at the excellent Hilton Dubai Creek, the prices of hotels in Dubai since then have, I feel doubled. Since you cant stay at the beach these days for less than 250 quid the grand is excellent value for money. Of course if your expecting 5 star luxury then you will be disapointed but if you want a good base for a 1 or 2 night stopover you cant go far wrong here. If you want the beach i would recommend the public beach adjacent to the Jumeriah complex. Its quiet and you get a great view of the Burj Al arab. The Beach parks are dirty and full of staring men ogling anything in a bikini. I would also recommend the new Dubai mall, it has one of the largets fish tanks in the world (free) and even if you dont like shopping its bawesome, we also got a cab to the unfinished Burj tower.

Wanting to get some rest in a comfortable setting, I decided to venture out of the airport and check into a hotel. I went through a Dubai International Airport hotel reservation counter which was located just past the passport control. The person behind the counter recommended the Dubai Grand Hotel and said it had a four star rating. He also told me the taxi was only going to cost me $10. He forgot to tell me that it would be that much only if I got an HONEST taxi, but that is a different story. After I agreed to the rate ($119), I started looking behind the counter at the advertized hotels. I couldnt find the Dubai Grand Hotel listed anywhere. There were hotels listed by star rating off to the right. No Grand Hotel. That should have been my second clue. As the \"reservationist\" was helping me, I mentioned this fact and asked him if the Dubai Grand Hotel was truly a four star hotel. He assured that it was. I also asked if they had internet capability in the rooms. He also said yes. I paid for the room and went on to get ripped off by the taxi. The taxi took the LONG way to the hotel and made a $10 trip into a $15 trip. When I got to the hotel, I told the front desk that I thought I was being ovrecharged by the taxi that had brought me. They sent a bell boy outside to talk to him. He at least stopped the taxi driver from taking me for $20 using his exchange rate, but did nothing about the inflated meter reading. The bell boy suggested that I get Dirhams (local currency) from the front desk. I only had large denominations, but I asked the front desk to only give me $20 worth of Dirhams and the rest US. They promptly exchanged the entire $50 amount at their inflated exchange rate and completely ignored my request. After being checked in, they insisted on keeping my passport until I checked out. This is something that I never have been asked for in all of the international hotels that I have been to (upwards of 20). If anything, a photocopy of my passport has been taken, but never the original. I dont advise anyone to agree to that. I did because I was tired and didnt want to argue anymore after the taxi ordeal. Once I was outside my room, I noticed that about three doors down, one of the hotel staff was entering a room with a key and saying out loud, \"Housekeeping\" as he entered. I checked into my room at 4 AM local time. What the heck is a hotel staffer doing going into a guests room at 4AM?? He had no towels, no, roll-away bed, no luggage, nothing..... I'll let you decide. Once inside the room, I put the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign out, deadbolted the door and immediately noted that I was NOT in a four or even three star hotel. The carpet was stained and worn. The wallpaper was stained and peeling. The \"brass\" light fixtures were worn and rusted. The room had that peculiar Indian from India smell to it. (You know the one I'm talking about). All and all, The room was of a cheap motel quality. The \"mini-bar\" consisted of a mini-refrigerator with a 4 cans of soda, 2 bottles of water and a crumpled juice box. The bathroom was appointed with VERY cheap ammenities and decor. The bathroom floor was dirty. The personal lotion bottle that was included in the comfort section of ammenities had been previously opened and used (about 1/4 of it was gone). Having been in worse hotels, I decided to make the best of it. The water in the shower would not get hotter than warm and the in room thermostat did not regulate a thing. I froze my butt off and I had just come in from having spent two weeks in the Korean winter! The tv remote didnt work and the internet access was dial up. I had to unplug the phone to use the internet at a per hour rate. This hotel was definitely NOT four star. It was more or a two star and that is being generous. I do not recommend the stay at any price above $19.99 a night. I felt compelled to write this review after seeing that somebody gave this place a four star rating. Must have been a hotel staffer that went in one of the guest rooms at 4AM and used the internet on their dime.", "Date": "January 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly fine 4 star with great service\u201d", "Author": "Innamincka", "ReviewID": "UR4250733", "Content": "I stayed at the Dubai Grand for one night in transit, and it is what it professes to be, a 4 star hotel.

The Dubai Grand is very close to Terminal 2, and about a $US10 taxi to Terminal 1.", "Date": "December 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin, Germany", "Title": "\u201cNever again!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4160202", "Content": "I stayed there for four nights. For professional reasons I spend some 100 nights per year in hotels all over the world. I have been to other hotels in Dubai before. I would not call Dubai a benchmark for outstanding service, neither for good prices. But even in comparison with that this place is horrible. Dirty old carpet in the room, stains on chairs and sofa. The balcony dirty and dusty. You would not want to touch anything, let alone sit down. The way you are treated by receptionists gives the impression that they assume you constantly want to betray them. Not a single smile, not a single friendly word, no Hello, no Goodbye, not even after checking out. You seem to be disturbing them all the time.

Service was poor. Staff tried to rip us off when we asked about booking the Dune Safari. We were told that we could not to sit in the lobby area as we were not buying anything. The double room that we were given was located on the 2nd floor directly above a disco, with loud blazing music that went on until 3pm, resulting in five restless nights. The water from the taps was not hot, just barley warm thus we could not take an adequate bath or shower. I spoke to one of your staff members regarding the noise and water the first day, where I was assured that the situation will be resolved, and that I will be given another room on the top floor. From that first day till the night before the last day yet again I went back to the reception with the same problems but the matters were not resolved. Also we visited one of the clubs in the hotel called \u2018Shama\u2019 despite the fact that we were not aware of what kind of club this was until after ordering our drinks we were charged a ridiculous amount of 50 dirham for two glasses of coke and we only stayed there for 15 minutes and despite writing a letter of complaint with the above points to the management, they basically offered no form of apology or compensation.
