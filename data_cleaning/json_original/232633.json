The room was clean, the bed was clean, the bathroom was clean, everything was in a good condition. 1 free bottle of water and a delicious breakfast buffet (included in the price) with organic yogurt, cheese and sandwich meat.The environment is okay, across the hotel is a police station. It wasn't very noisy, I haven't had any problems to sleep. To be on the save side, I recommend to get a room on one of the upper floors.My result: I liked the hotel and I would always stay there again.", "Date": "Feb 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR386610791", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "fylgir"}, {"Content": "Great service, Central location       Hotel Cristall Frankfurt - Room", "Date": "Oct 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR481837084", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "CassowarySAS"}, {"Content": "A Nice Break, very clean! My daughter and I arrived at the Hauptbahnhof in Frankfurt and were checked into a creepy hostel. We checked right back out. We went back to the Hauptbahnhof and asked if there were any other more suitable accomodations nearby. We were directed a block of so away to the Hotel Cristall.It is a small hotel with a friendly staff. Our room was clean, and we were just far enough away from the Hauptbahnhof to not be disturbed by rail noise. They were redoing carpets and apologized.We were delighted by their breakfast set up. The tables all had linens, and there were many things to choose from.If you want a decent clean friendly place to stay right across from the Hauptbahnhof...on a budget..enjoy", "Date": "Aug 31, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR627879635", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Molto carino, personale gentile   showReview(11979055, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR229633173", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Heidi_KT"}, {"Content": "Teuer mit schlampiger Ausstattung   showReview(3936932, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 25, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR474996443", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "\u9358\u8bf2\u52fe\u9287\ue1be\ue750\u9287\ue0a0\u5114\u9288\u3083\u510e\u9287\ue0a5\ue511...   showReview(19921631, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 24, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR843149231", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d232633-r21505536-Hotel_Cristall-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "232633", "Price": "$291"}}
