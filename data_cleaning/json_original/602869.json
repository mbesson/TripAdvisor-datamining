{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Dont go until adjacent building has finished We stayed at Puri Madwai for 2 nights in July 08. We were due to stay longer but checked out early. Our room was fine and the staff helpful. However the walk to the beach is through a slum,not much they can do about that I know. I could have put up with that,but what I couldnt put up with was the constant building noise. Across a narrow road is a building site which looks like it has a long way to go before completion. If it was only noisy during the day then perhaps it wouldnt have been a problem but this site operates 24 hours a day. My advice would be dont go unless you know for sure the buiding work on the adjacent and unrelated building site is complete, or take some very good ear muffs!", "Date": "Sep 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR530869743", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "RoverManchester"}, {"Content": "Quiet  Puri Madawi is the kind of place where you can get away from the crowds and feel like you are in your own world. Just 5 minutes walk from a relatively empty beach, past a local temple and some massage huts, it is secluded enough without being isolating. Within 5-10 minutes by taxi, you can be in the heart of the shops and other resorts if you want some excitement and busy hustle of the outside world. The resort was very quiet and almost tranquil despite being fully booked. I enjoyed this aspect of it; laid by the pool without disruptions or noise. The staff is very friendly. Food was quite good when we had breakfast and dinner. Would recommend for those who want peace  quiet or for wedding parties who want to make their own party in being together. Suites are comfortable and simple with windows overlooking the pool. Mosquito nets were provided for the beds, although there wasn't any problem with bugs during my stay. The front porch was also very nice for reading books and enjoying cocktails.", "Date": "Dec 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR980063102", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "LilyChina"}, {"Content": "DITY The adventure in getting to the place is part of the attraction - like no-one seems to know where it is. Including taxi drivers and courier drivers from the airport. Having studied Kerobokan road maps before we arrived, I knew more than the drivers.Compact hotel, and loved the two-storey Lumbung we booked, but it took about ten minutes to get any attention when we arrived at about 21.00. The sole attendant was On the toilet'.Breakfast was included, but its restricted menu became a little boring after a few days. We didn't try any other meals.Best features, quiet and secluded, excellent accommodation, clean and functional, top service, mainly from young and attracive ladies. Great place to crash out. There is a beach about 5 - 10 minutes walk away - but if you can say this about a beach - pretty scruffy, but again, you would sure have it to yourself.Minus features - can' think of anything significant, apart from that the management or owners seem to observe strict 9 to 5 hours - maybe they have other interests. A little off the beaten track, but that suited us. If there were not so many other great places to stay in Bali, we would sure stay there again.", "Date": "Nov 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR836731883", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "nevl"}, {"Content": "Own Transport Recommended Puri Madawi is a beautiful boutique hotel, we enjoyed our stay overall, however there were a couple of small hiccups. I would recommend that you hire your own vehicle, the resort is a little far out from the main areas of Seminyak for restaurants and shopping purposes. It is ideal if you want out of the busy Kuta scene. The reception staff seem to need more training. When we arrived the staff member who greeted us did not seem to initially understand that we had already paid for the accomodation and that we only had to give her the vouchers from our travel agent. This was I admit resolved fairly quickly. When we were leaving several days later there was another problem when the same staff member overcharged us substantially for our food bill on our credit card. She did point this out to us so there was no dishonesty involved, however she did not know how to cancel the transaction. The manger was away for a few days which meant that there was no one at the resort who could resolve this. She then recharged the correct amount telling us that she would get the manager to cancel the previous transaction on his return. We were obviously a little concerned about this but as we were staying on the island we decided to accept this and contact the manager after a couple of days and ensure this was followed through and ask for a fax of the cancelled transaction.It took several follow up phone calls to rectify this. The food is the restaurant overall is very average. The rooms are beautiful and well kept, it is also wonderful and quiet. So for me very mixed views, I am not sure that I would stay there again.", "Date": "Jul 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR538193028", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "NatnDave"}, {"Content": "Puri Madawi is a great find Puri Madawi is a great find, quiet and just far enough away from the busy areas without costing too much to get there.

Extremely reasonably priced, very friendly and helpful staff, a wonderful pool and beautiful rooms, with outdoor bathrooms. We stayed for two nights and wished we stayed for longer. It's a great base for exploring the south of Bali, or to start a tour of the Island (we went on to the north from here). The food's not the greatest, but the bar and bar staff were lovely, and there are plenty of very good restaurants nearby.

We loved the place from the moment we stepped into it. Although when we first entered the small road leading to Puri Madawi we were wondering what to expect.Greeted personnally by the Manager we were brought to our rooms. We have been to Bali already a couple of times, but I have to say this is the most tastefull place we have been so far (our budget has its limits thogh). After we had settled in we went back to the reception to get some information about transportation and what to do arround the area. We were given a number of suggestions on restaurants, nightlife and tours - which we found very valuable. We hired a car for a very reasonable price and did not have to do anything as everything was smoothly organized.The breakfast at Puri Madawi was the full treat - fresh croissants, fruit and more we could ever eat.We had snacks during the afternoon a couple of times - yummy!The beach is inviting for long and very private walks, yet the currents can be too strong for swimming. We prefered the beautiful pool anyway.The staff was always helpfull and friendly - no more can be expected.We will be back in August with some friends and looking very much forward to it.Anna Spiegel", "Date": "May 19, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR499232961", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Good Value, nice rooms Our stay at Puri Madawi began a little strangely given that we were the only guests. It is a small hotel at the Kerobokan end of Seminyak, so it's important to have transport to get around. The hotel is nicely appointed in the 'Bali style', though I wouldn't say cutting-edge. Our double storey villa was spacious and comfortable, with everything we required. We had an outdoor sitting area overlooking the garden and pool, and a tiny courtyard next to the bathroom (however, no bath). The area is very peaceful, flanked by rice paddies, and a short walk to the beach. The beach nearby is also very quiet, but not one of the best I have seen in Bali. The staff are friendly and helpful and everything is well maintained. The breakfast (an additional cost) is not recommended, but we felt obliged to eat there because we were the only guests for several days! On the upside, that meant we could drink and listen to our own music by the pool. Overall, the distance from happening things was a downside, but the peace and quiet and spaciousness of our room (for the reasonable price) was a positive.", "Date": "Apr 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR263165229", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "liddi"}, {"Content": "Eine angenehme \u813aberraschung       Extra Suites am Pool", "Date": "Aug 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR902365534", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Heikebali"}, {"Content": "Excellent   showReview(17426398, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR338056548", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "reisetravelTM"}, {"Content": "Achtung Baustelle       Bad Extra Suite", "Date": "May 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR500511009", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Batavia08"}, {"Content": "small is beautifull       Teil der Anlage mit Pool", "Date": "Jun 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR586715648", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Korni"}, {"Content": "F\u7709r Bali sehr wenig Service   showReview(7740000, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR330315162", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Merjam"}, {"Content": "Havre de paix   showReview(6170751, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR801170948", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bermart"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469404-d602869-r19706356-Puri_Madawi-Seminyak_Bali.html", "HotelID": "602869", "Price": "$103"}}
