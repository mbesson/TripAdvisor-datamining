The two negatives about this hotel are the location and the parking. Although it's accross from a nice shopping area, it's not near any attractions so we had to drive everywhere.

However, I suspect the reason people choose to stay at Ritz-Carltons (including us) is for the service and amenities. This is where this hotel and most importantly, the staff, does not disappoint. Despite the age, the hotel is well-maintained and clean. It is very much a business hotel, but we were there on vacation and felt very comfortable. The location is central and across the street from Biltmore Mall and a movie theatre. When we stay at Ritz-Carltons, we choose to stay on the Club Level, as the continuous food presentations and beverage options throughout the day certainly complete the whole experience and add to the value. Here, it is on the 11th floor and the design of it is a bit different in that when you exit off the elevator, you walk straight into the Club Lounge. Typically from staying at other Ritz properties, the Club Lounge is in a separate room. Jean, the concierge on staff at the Club Lounge is excellent. She certainly embodies the level of service that you would expect of the Ritz-Carlton. She is kind and inquisitive, without ever being intrusive. What you later realize, she knows just the questions to ask just so she can then ask how can she help. After mentioning one morning that the A/C unit wasn't cooling in our room, she almost seemed perplexed that we hadn't mentioned it during the night; reminding us that they have engineers on staff 24/7. An engineer had the issue resolved within 30 minutes of mentioning it to her. As mentioned in some of the other reviews, the pool is rather small, so certainly not the size you would see at their resort properties. There are only a few lounge chairs, although they have a larger cabana area that would be perfect to add some more chaises, but while we were there, they chose to keep it empty. On a Friday afternoon with the pool area so full that we ended up sitting in two chairs from the dining area, there was only one pool attendant on duty. Not the typical level of service you normally see at a Ritz, but this was the only noticeable delinquency I observed during our stay.

My best friend and I had a terrific 3 night stay. Here are the high and very slight low lights. I will start with the few lowlights. Is this a business hotel- yes? What does it matter? Well- only if you wanted a hot tub (no) and wanted a big pool with a pool side bar (no). Yes- you can get a drink- but it was off the room service menu with a phone (ouch). Also- yes, they do set up in our case the hybrid seed consortium of some sort eating lunch in cowboy hats (who cares). I had read the hallway is noisy- and yes that was a bit true. End of any shortcomings... My friend's daughter had to make a last minute appearance- and they promptly set up a complimentary super comfortable cot- all gratis. And arranged to get her back to the airport- wow. The best kept secret is this amazing Friday night buffet- for $42, the most amazing spread. Well well worth it. Another secret was happy hour. On Thursday and Friday- (I think) 5-7pm they had $5 cocktails that are normally $13- wow. And appetizers- also $5 each. I wonder why they did not tell us at check-in? But alas we figured it out. The location is terrific- we walked across the street and had access to more restaurants than you could eat at for a week- and top shelf shopping (some too top shelf for me). And a Macy's- ho hum. But fun Lulu Lemon new store. Also there was free yoga on the Sunday morning we were there- but we did not figure that out until we showed up in regular clothes. One last tip- there is a Dine In AMC movie theatre steps away. If you haven't been- check it out. Very very cool- cocktails, easy chairs, a waiter. Who knew this existed? Get buy 1 get 1 coupon off web. The Ritz has a great complimentary computer room- wow (print your movie coupon)! Many machines, many printers (AND they had also offered to print out our boarding passes for us.) Does it get any better than that service? I forgot one last thing- they have this ExecuCar service. For the same price as a cab- they sent a nice towncar to pick us up and drop us off at the airport. We felt like celebrities... A note- we took a nice walk to The Biltmore Hotel Spa to catch some treatments and use their facilities (grabbed the before mentioned ExecuCar back for $10). Used their beautiful pools, hot tubs, restaurant. But their spa was run down in our opinion- old magazines, typical expensive services. Not a bad idea though for great pool action... Next time- I would try the Red Door across the street. Restaurant tip- we ate at Tarbells (again walked but called for car coming back). Awesome restaurant- iron chef, make a reservation- well worth it. I hope this helps- and thanks for everyone's past input on hotels!

The Ritz does have great service. Movies ranged from $16.99 down to $4.99 for TV show reruns. Only limited TV stations are provided (although there must be 5 or more sports channels). Only enough supplies in room to make two cups of coffee in the morning - a room-service delivered 6-cup pot ended up costing $35 after the delivery charge, taxes, and 22% gratuity added to the bill.

The rooms are smaller than expected, the safe is very small and still uses a KEY to access it (one key only, and not enough room for a laptop!), there is a mini bar, fridge by request, small closet, small bathroom, bathrobes, iron/board, etc. The room is in good shape, but with an old style decor and nothing is modern in it. Even the scale is not digital! However, things are very clean. The bed does not have a fitted sheet, so sometimes the mattress gets exposed. There is not much room to give too many towels, and they all seem to have a thread or two on them... but they are medium thickness and they absorb very well (comfortable), and they are clean. Club access is a nice benefit... allows 5 different servings of food through the day. For some people, this is more than enough to eat for the whole day. It always includes vegi choices, etc. Each time you take one or two little items, someone rushes out and adds more to the buffet type tables. There is always wine or champagne available without additional fee. There are also various cookies that are available 24 hours a day, plus water/soda and various candy. There is also free use of their computer/internet/printer. The club is sometimes a bit uncomfortable to deal with. There is always a person stationed as soon as you get off the elevator on the 11th floor. They don't mean to be nosy, but you cannot avoid talking to them and their questions about how you are, where you been, where you are going the next day, etc. Sometimes I just want to be left alone and not be bothered. They also need to make your specialized coffee drinks because the sound of the machine is too loud (other guests have complained) so they keep it in the back room for only the staff to use. i would have drunk about 3 more cups per day if the machine was accessible to me and I didn't have to bother the staff. Don't get me wrong, each person was extremely nice, well, maybe one was a bit off, but find a better place to sit so you are not in my face all the time when I get off the elevator. Anyways, it is well worth the upgrade fee to access the Club floor and food. The gym is small and they have about half the things you would expect. There is NO SPA in the hotel, but massages are available. There is a small pool, and it is often in the shade. The hotel has no shame when setting up a conference lunch poolside and allowing its other hotel guests site on lounge chairs right next to conference people that are wearing suit and ties. There are always a group of valets at the front door, waiting to hold the door open, get you a cab, or help you in some way. The main lobby is extremely nice, very clean, and comfortable to sit out for a while. There are always well dressed people walking by and it is fun to hang out for a while. The front desk staff are very pretty, professional, helpful, and genuine. The Bistro 24 staff was great. I asked my waiter if he could mix and match some of the food items and he replied something like 'the menu is more like a list of ingredients than anything else\" and accommodated my every request. He got a 25% tip. There was one semi-stained chair directly across from the elevator on the main flood. I am sure someone noticed it by now. Otherwise, completely spotless everywhere else. Housekeeping was quite good... turn down service every night. They never once bothered me by knocking or calling when I had the do not disturb sign up. Although I nitpicked some items above, i really do not think anyone is going to be disappointed staying at this hotel. And there will be a bunch of very happy business travelers.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia Beach, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cRitz Carlton Phoenix\u201d", "Author": "christineelenamaria", "ReviewID": "UR120211751", "Content": "Our stay (October 2011) at the RC Phoenix was great!

With such beautiful and tasteful public areas, the guestrooms feel like they belong to a different, lesser hotel. My queen-queen room on the 7th floor looked out over the mountains, which was nice. The room was clean, and the 40\u201d HDTV and HSIA worked fine, as expected. Curiously, this room is a throwback to a time when business travelers were expected to climb under the desk to plug in our equipment.

The closet is the size of a broom closet. The guestroom bathrooms are small. The a/c is cold but nothing will make the fan faster, so it took forever to cool the room. The good? The staff is very attentive, as expected at a Ritz, and the lobby and restaurant, Bistro 24, are very well appointed. The lobby lounge offers a good selection of bar food and a nice (but very expensive) list of wines by the glass. In-room coffee, mini-bar, and complimentary water are nice touches. And for dining, the hotel is a short and easy walk to Starbucks, Zinburger, Morton\u2019s, and Cheesecake Factory, among several others. The not-so-good?

Headsets were provided so that you could watch TV while working out on the cardio machines, but sometimes, there were not enough headsets, so it's best to bring your own. The valet were great at helping with driving directions and telling you the best and quickest ways to get places. Business center was small with 2 computers with fairly decent internet connection and printer. There was also another computer designated to print out boarding passes. The hairdryer busted the first night I was there and the housekeeping staff was quick to replace it with a new one. The restaurant is good. I ate breakfast there twice.

And, while to a person, they were terrific, none was more excellent than the concierge, Gail Daugherty. What a great person to have on your side to make a road warriors's life easier. I had to make difficult to get dinner reservations at a top restaurant for an important client dinner and she not only took care of me, but called to tell me everything was set up and then after, to check and make sure everything went smoothly. Kudo's to the Ritz management for hiring such an impressive concierge. She truly made me feel that nothing was too big or too difficult for her to accomplish. As far as accommodations, the rooms were typical Ritz Carlton, lots of traditional furniture, very comfy beds and marble bathrooms. While not as up-to-date in style as other hotels (plasma TV's, CD players, etc.,) the rooms were perfectly comfortable with more than adequate room to work and relax.

The pool is located on the roof of the first floor and is not a concrete pool -- it is a fiberglass pool measuring about 15'x30' and not even 4' deep, and there is no jacuzzi. The fitness center adequate, furnished with newer cardio machines, some weight machines and older looking free weights and a couple TVs. Do not expect individual screens or flat panels or even flat screens. In defense, most business travelers (the Ritz's target demographic) probably don't care much about individual TV screens and free-form infinity pools and rock formation hot-tubs. What I would imagine business travelers care about most (I was visiting for a football game -- business in its own right) are beds, internet access, and showers, in that order. The beds are phenomenal -- so plush I fell into a euphoric bliss. They feature down pillows, quality linens, and the most overstuffed featherbed on which I've ever slept. Each room also features a quality Panasonic clock/radio/cd player which sounded good (a poor-man's Bose Wave Radio). The internet access ($9.95 per day) is wireless in the room and presented zero problems. As good as the bed is, the shower is a close runner-up. Many up-market hotels are opting for rainfall showerheads, which seem appealing in theory but often miss the mark because of poor water pressure. This bathroom had an older looking (though premium quality) standard-size showerhead, and it was perfect. It maintained a more than sufficient amount of pressure without stinging or creating a windstorm. Kudos on \"keeping it real\" with the old-school showerhead. The guestrooms also feature an ample-sized desk, complimentary coffee/tea/water with a sleek new coffee maker, and early-90s TV set. My only gripe with the room is with the television - it simply doesn't fit with the rest of the room. The in-room dining menu could definitely use some tweaking. Prices are pretty standard (dare I say reasonable?) for an upscale hotel, but menu offerings are pretty limited (I didn't order anything so I can't comment on the food itself). While the outdoor public areas are totally forgettable, the lobby and lounge area exude an old world ambience without the stuffiness one might expect from a luxury/business property. The staff overall was pleasant and accommodating (they granted me a late check-out without flinching), but the ladies in housekeeping and doormen deserve special recognition. The room was spotless for the duration of the stay, the rollaway was brought up when requested, and the two times I approached one of the ladies for extra towels or shampoo they were so genuinely happy to help. The doormen were also great with directions and recommendations around Phoenix. In closing, I would advise that if you are looking to relax and unwind, you might wish to look elsewhere. However, for a weekend trip or business excursion, it's hard to beat the Ritz.
