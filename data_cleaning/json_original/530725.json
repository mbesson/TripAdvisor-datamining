I\u2019ve never seen such an old tv system \u2013 couldn\u2019t even figure out how to turn it on. You could barely turn around in the bathroom it was so small. I went out to see the sights, and when I returned to the hotel around 9:30pm, the door was locked. So, I saw a button which I imagined was the doorbell to the front desk. I pressed the button, but didn\u2019t hear anything, and nothing happened, so I pressed it once more. Then, I heard some loud yelling from inside the building and the door was unlocked. I walked up the stairs and a man came out (the front desk receptionist) and he yelled at me, \u201cNo due, solo uno!\u201d (Translation: \u201cNot twice, just once.\u201d) I could not believe the hotel man was yelling at a guest over the doorbell. How did I know he heard it the first time? He didn\u2019t open the door with the first ring. There was another couple in the lobby who heard all the commotion, and I started laughing to lighten up the situation and so did they, but the hotel guy gave me a mean, accusatory look, so I said, \u201cWhat, is there a problem? and then in Italian: \u201cChe, problema?\u201d and I think he wanted to fight (by the look on his face) but then he had to go answer the phone. I went back to my room and as soon as I went into the bathroom to take a shower, I noticed how filthy the sink area was. The stopper had been removed from the sink and the exterior surface of the sink looked dirty and old. The worst part was the shower stall. It had mold all over. It was so disgusting, I didn\u2019t even want to take a shower, but with the humidity, I really needed to. This was appalling \u2013 the fact that a hotel could operate in this condition, with a huge amount of mold and risk of a health hazard and fungus issues in the shower. (I have photographs for proof of all of this.) Then, in the middle of the night, I was awakened by the blasting air conditioning. The room had become as cold as a meat locker. I looked all over for the remote control (as most European hotels have a remote to control the air conditioning), but there was nothing. I tried calling the front desk, but dialing 0 did not go anywhere. I couldn\u2019t figure out how to dial the front desk \u2013 there was no explanation on the phone. It was 2am and I was freezing cold, and had to get up in a few hours to go to the airport. I finally went to where the fire exit instructions were in the room, and it had the number to call the front desk. It was something unexpected like 033. I called and I asked how to turn off the A/C, and the man said, \u201cok, bye.\u201d And I was thinking he was going to hang up on me because he didn\u2019t understand the request. I asked again and he repeated the same answer, but then the A/C went off, so I realized the front desk had the controls \u2013 there was nothing in the room. This hotel was full of extreme inconveniences and I had the worst night sleep of my whole trip in this hotel. Furthermore, when I woke up in the morning, there was water all over the toilet and floor and I looked up and there was some sort of big leak from the ceiling which was likely coming from the toilet in the room upstairs. Again, disgusting! Then, the breakfast: This was supposed to be a \u201ccontinental breakfast.\u201d What did they serve? Some rolls and old croissants that they put in a bread warmer (so that you couldn\u2019t tell they were old pastries, but it was obvious because those croissants were so dry, they must have been more than a couple days old.). The coffee came out of some automated machine and it was horrible \u2013 undrinkable. What a misrepresentation for Expedia to rate this hotel 3 stars. I wouldn\u2019t even give it one star because it was a health hazard and from everything I\u2019ve described here, the worst hotel experience of my life. Take my advice and take your money elsewhere.

We happened to stay here for our honeymoon. Sure it is not the most glamorous room in all of Rome, but at the same time, when you are in Rome, there is so much to see -- the last of our focus was the condition of the room. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Termini. That is not bad at all, and frequently my wife and I would walk down the street at night and never had any second thoughts about our safety. I would rather be walking in that neighborhood than say some parts of Lansing where I am from. The neighborhood looks shady, but the bums keep to themselves. Not really and issue for us. And while the attractions are not right within walking distance, that is why they have the Metro, which is easily reachable by either the Termini or Manzoni stops. The staff was not bad -- yeah I did not love the idea about paying 20 euro for the remote, but I did get that money back, and I did not really have time to watch TV. The staff was helpful when we asked them, got a taxi for us on the day we left and provided directions for us when we needed them.

We cannot get upset that people do not all speak English -- perhaps they are upset with us that we don't speak Italian -- it is their country after all. All in all, however, we were able to communicate just fine with the staff. As for the breakfast - it is a typical Italian breakfast - simple pastries and coffee. Never really had any complaints about it, and certainly did not expect an Egg McMuffin or a Cracker Barrell breakfast. In fact, the patries were pretty good there.

Claims made in disjointed english about it being just 'steps' from the Collosseum are hilarious, provided one doesn't have to actually stay in this hotel. At present, metro station Manzoni is closed for emergency repairs. This means a trek of about 10 minutes just to get to another out of the way metro station (Vittorio Emmanuele II), that you absolutely do need to use to get in to town (just do not try to walk it, like you would be led to believe you can.) Termini, far from being 5 minutes walk away, is a good 20, and 30 if one is leaden down with baggage. This is not conducive to anything other than a pack mule experience. What's worse is that for a newbie to Rome - which my family and I were - one cannot understate the failed multicultural experiment that the Esquiline area is. Under no circumstances stay here. The place is a haven for unsavoury characters. To list a few incidents; there were the usual drunken gangs of youths, who were vandalising the Vittorio Emmanuele metro station when we walked past them. Then there were the beggars and gypsy families rummaging through rubbish bins, the mentally ill pushing trolleys around and muttering indecipherable jibberish to themselves, people drinking on the street, those with visible venereal diseases and lesions, and there was even the ubiquitous old man and his dog that gets better care than he can afford to give to himself. What can one say, this neighbourhood could be compared to the Harlem of New York. Perhaps not quite as severe purely from a law and order perspective, but certainly traversing the dimly lit, graffiti filled, rubbish lined streets of this neighbourhood, one doesn't feel at all safe. Indeed, one has to buzz the reception from the outside of the hotel before one is let in. The breakfast? They call it continental, I call it stingy. In the hotel's 'breakfast room', maintained by dishevelled cleaning staff that are clearly bussed in from an agency, there are 2 drinks machines. One dispenses 'orange juice' and 'pineapple juice'. However, it really is the luck of the draw which one you get, as they seem to pay no heed to the labels on the front of the machine. I got a glass of pineapple juice that was utterly repulsive, that went down about as well as gut rot. Both juices (when I eventually got orange juice) were watered down heavily, and that's probably just as well, as the concentrated juice could probably induce real gut rot. The other machine dispenses equally vile coffee, tea and as a real treat - tea with milk. To eat? Plastic packets containing some sort of sweetbread, and hard, even (dare I say it!) stale bread rolls. None of the trappings of a usual continental breakfast. Absolutely none. Nothing cooked, no cereals, no toast, no yoghurts, no fruit, no cold meat, nothing. To their credit, they really did splurge by providing two varieties of jam with which to stain your stale bread roll. How dare these people call the breakfast 'continental'? It's a blatant lie. Then we come to the staff. The blurb informs us that the excellent, english speaking staff, are ready to provide advice on sight seeing and restaurants in the vicinity. Trouble is, that with English as poor as these staff had, the best we managed were confusion filled exchanges. Following a wearying trip in from the airport, around 10 o'clock at night, after hauling our bags down Via Giolitti, we were greeted by a man of not many teeth, nor many years left to live, who was bemused when we asked him, quite specifically, about local steakhouses. Then, he had a Eureka moment, and remembered to reccomend a restaurant that I can only presume is linked to the hotel from the name - Restaurant Center . We had the good sense to not follow his incoherent directions, and instead decided to brave the McDonalds that night. If the breakfast matched the dinner in any way, then I can say we were better off. The rooms. Oh yes. The rooms. Fair play, they are clean, and the marble finish perhaps doesn't make the adjective 'Spartan' the most apt one, but I'm going to use it anyway. The sattelite television did not work, the minifridge was not stocked (that is not the impression that is given in any blurb), in the bathroom, instead of the usual soap and shampoo bottles there were the stingiest offerings of detergent I have ever seen - literally condiment sachets of Shampoo. Three of them. You'd use about 2 just washing your hair. They were not replaced until the third day of our stay. The towels? Don't expect anything downy, these are strictly efficient sheets of linen designed to soak up water. Then there is the air conditioning. Firstly, it is noisy, but secondly one has to contact reception to turn it on and off. There is absolutely no need for centrally controlled air conditioning in this day and age, and is more of a disgrace seeing that this hotel was renovated in 2004. Then there was the noise. No, not any kind of noise from street level. A much more insidious one. A low 'click click click' from behind the headboard of the bed. Intermittent, unpredictable, and like some Greek vision of hell, this repetitous sound made sleep impossible. Only by going without sleep for one night, and then tiring myself out utterly in Rome for the day, did I eventually nod off on the second day of my visit. No such luck on the third night of my stay. Guess I just hadn't gone without enough sleep. We complained, and all the staff did was to promise to get maintenence to look at it in the morning. Clearly they never did, as the clicking persisted. My advice is to try and get a room in the older east wing of the property, where there are no headboards on the beds. (My father's room was in the east wing, and he slept soundly, though, he would sleep through a war.) In Hotel Center 3, one can only get to rooms in the west wing of the property by using a cramped lift. This lift can carry just 3 people, and is unresponsive to calls most of the time, meaning that getting down to reception in the morning can take the best part of 5 minutes, as there is no stairwell access (save for the emergency exit that leads down to the street outside). What's worse, is that the lift actually stuck on our way up to our room once. A claustrophobe's worst nightmare, or indeed, anyone who is terrified of being trapped in a lift, would be well advised to give this hotel a miss. This hotel was well below the three start standard that my family and I paid for, in a terrible part of town, and unfortunately we just did not do our research. There are 2 star pensione and youth hostels in the areas adjoining to the Spanish Steps and the Vatican that are miles ahead of this dump.

Giolitti but the hotel, which is close to Porta Maggiore is clean, comfortable with staff who on first impression appear surly but are actually very helpful. The rooms are of a good size and the bathrooms have a wash basin, a combined toilet / bidet and a shower. The water pressure is good, the cleanliness is excellent, the breakfast typical. Clean towels every day. While we were there they installed satellite TV in our room! The easiest way to get anywhere from the hotel is to walk to Manzoni Metro station - about 10 minutes or a tram or bus from Porta Maggiore. The day tickets for EUD4.00 are excellent value if you plan to hop around the city a lot.

The rooms were okay but nothing special and the breakfast was reasonable but certainly not sumptious, real coffee and juice rather than from a machine would have been nice. The staff, with one acception, were not very friendly and seemed a little put out at times. Sullen faces greating guests on entering and leaving with an occassional smile seemed a little inappropriate for, as it says, a three star hotel.
