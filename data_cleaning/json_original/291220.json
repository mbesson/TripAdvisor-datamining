I was looking for an inexpensive place to stay while visiting my son who lives in the Haight area. When I found the Carl Hotel, I was suspicious that it would be unsafe or dirty because the price seemed too cheap for San Francisco...I had my son check it out, and he gave it a thumbs up, so I took my chances, and was VERY pleased. Sure, the rooms are small, have old furniture, bland decor, and some of the carpeting looked worn, but everything was clean, the bed was comfortable, the shower had good water pressure, and you can't beat the great location in Cole Valley, a quiet residential neighborhood near the light rail line...One block away is Cole Street, where you can grab coffee or breakfast, and only a few blocks to Haight St, where even more restaurants and stores are..Also very close to Golden Gate Park, which is a great way to spend the day...The two negatives: the light rail line runs right in front of the hotel, so at night, you can periodically hear and feel it as it goes by (after the first night, it didn't bother me at all). The other slight negative is that there is no one on duty in the early AM or late at night, so if you need info. or want to check out, you may not find someone to help you. Because I was leaving at 6am, I checked out the night before, which was no problem.Other than those two small issues, the Carl was a great place to stay, and if you're just using your hotel as a place to sleep and take a shower, it's the perfect choice.", "Date": "Aug 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR929318763", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "curlyBJS"}, {"Content": "The Carl Hotel was cheap and clean I needed to stay close to UCSF when my husband had surgery there last fall. We stayed there a few weeks before for a pre-op procedure and stayed on the second floor. It was a small but clean room. My only complaint was the muni train noise (it didn't run all night thank goodness). When my husband was in the hospital I spent the first 5 nights at a BB. They were booked for the last 3 nights that I needed to be there, so I switched to the Carl. To save money, I stayed in one of the ground floor rooms. Tiny with only a twin bed, shared bath, water took forever to get hot but it was clean. And I did have a mini fridge, a microwave, a small cable TV and a hair dryer. The Muni Train was less noisy; it was more the vibration. But hey it was only $55.- plus tax a night.

We stayed at the Carl while we visited a friend just a short walk away. We had the largest room available but it was very reasonable at $115. We started out in a smaller room and asked to be moved. The staff was very accommodating and even moved our luggage to the new room while we were out. The room was spacious and clean and the refrigerator and microwave were very handy. The train was noisy but we got used to it. The location is terrific with shops and restaurants nearby and we (two women) felt completely comfortable walking around the neighborhood.

I was not disappointed--the room was clean and comfortable, the desk clerk was very polite, and I experienced no itchy sheets. Yes, there was trolley noise--but compared to more central locations in SF, neighborhood noise was minimal, even for a Friday night.We'll definitely consider the Carl for non-hospital trips--there are a couple of rooms available that would be more comfortable for two, according to the desk clerk.

If you're looking for a cheap place to stay in a great location, this is it. The rates were very reasonable ($70 ish), rooms were a bit snug, but we didn't plan on spending much time there anyway so it didn't make difference. It's an older building with a bit of charm, but everything was clean and the rooms even included a mini fridge and microwave.The location is right in the heart of the city in a cute and safe neighborhood. It's a couple blocks from GG park and Haight Ashbury. Plus the MUNI (subway) line goes right by the hotel, so you can get to anywhere in the city just by walking out the front door. Very convenient. The noise of the trains was not bad at all in my opinion.
