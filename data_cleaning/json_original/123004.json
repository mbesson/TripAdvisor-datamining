We could see the Space Needle out our window - we were only a few blocks away. There is a monorail you can catch at the Space Needle to take you downtown. We did not use this option so I don't know how much it cost but the convenience is great considering parking in the downtown area can be hard to come by and expensive. It was also easy to get on and off the freeway. The bathroom shower was perfect in my opinion - I can't stand a stream with no strength and this one was great. The breakfast and free internet were much appreciated and certainly helped with our expenses on this trip. Parking was fairly easy although there was one night where we got the very last spot so I am not sure what would have happened if we had returned any later. There were also a few spaces that looked like they would be pretty tight to get into. Probably the biggest negative was the noise we could hear from the busy road outside. This was probably worse for us as we were on the second floor and right on the road - a higher floor or a room on the other side (the alley side) might be quieter. I am not sure if were given this room specifically because we purchased the room through Hotwire - sometimes I think the worst rooms are given to Hotwire clients since they are paying less. We may have noticed it more because we live in a very quiet area where there is virtually no noise outside at night. The breakfast could be better but I have also seen much worse. I would like to see them label the offerings each day - there were 2 different days that omelets were offered but it was not clear what was in them. There was a sign in the elevator but we took the stairs each day because the wait for the elevator could be pretty long and we were only on the 2nd floor. The room was comfortable - we had a queen and a sleeper sofa, a refrigerator, and a microwave. The biggest issue was that when the sleeper was pulled out (which for us was the whole time) there was no room for the chair to be moved around at the desk.

Location is OK at best, though really depends on why you're in Seattle and what you want to do. It is located on a rather busy and grimy street but if that's not an issue, Seattle City Center is just a block away and Belltown/Downtown is a 10-15 walk or shorter bus ride in. If you have a car and need to get around, driving to I-5 or other major arteries seems easy. The room was clean, as were the rest of the premises. \"Fitness room\" really just consists of five outdated cardio machines and a treadmill, and the pool is really only usable if no more than 3 people are in it (or say, 4-6 little kids which, on this trip, were the primary users). Great for 1-2 night business travel, or perhaps a short vacation for young families traveling on a tight budget. Breakfast could really benefit from some fresh fruit, but then again it's there and free if you want it...mostly biscuits, eggs and a meat microwaved in bulk.

The staff went above and beyond every single time, helping us with transportation, tours, restaurants, and so many directions. Everyone I encountered at this hotel was friendly and helpful. The negative things were the SMALL bathrooms. The bathroom (toilet area) is the exact width of the door, making it awkward to change clothes or do anything in the bathroom with so little space. There was also mold at the top of the shower. The pool was very small with no hot tub. The elevators (two) were very slow, especially in the morning rush for breakfast/checking out.

We had booked using Priority Points and were very lucky to get a parking space at the front of the building. We were given a room on the top floor (621) which had two large double beds which were good for us all, a flat screened television, and breakfast is included. We also accessed the internet using the wireless capability and it was a little slow at times but otherwise was fine for general work. The complementary newspaper was useful to get up to speed on what was happening in the city and around. The breakfast area was indeed very full and we were a little lucky to get a table on both mornings that we were there. However, the breakfast time availability was extended time and it did get quieter a little later. Cereals, fruit, toast, muffins as well as eggs etc were available and milk was available in cartons which you took to your table. A variety of fruit juices and coffee was also available. There was a large sofa with a large screened television also in this room to keep the children occupied when they did not want to sit at the table. Another plus with this hotel was the swimming pool itself which was great for the children. The only real downside was a lack of changing facilities and there only being one shower (all this is shared with the fitness room next door) so there was a wait and a quick change before heading back to the room. The room we were in was not on the Space needle side of the hotel and even on the top floor the noise of the bins being cleared was evident during the early morning. Also this floor is higher than the HI next door so you do get a good view towards the east side of the city and I5. The location is extremely good for a relatively short walk to the Needle and it was not bad for a walk into the basic shopping centre of the city itself. This was evident with our two young children and we actually used the reasonably priced monorail back to the Needle to come back. The general area around the hotel is a little run down but it is clear that it is being improved with new apartments and leisure spaces including restaurants between the hotel and the Needle. In conclusion this is a good value oriented hotel for visiting the Needle and the city centre. As we were tourists using our car to get to places was not really required, we used a \"tour\" to do this (if you want a little fun and have kids check out the Ducks).

The location is OK, and I like how Seattle lets you ride the downtown buses for free. There is a new light rail connection from SEA-TAC to Downtown, but the missing link at Tukwila will only be completed later this year. At present, you have to switch to a bus at Tukwila to complete that last section to SEA-TAC. There is also a 194 bus from SEA-TAC that goes all the way to Downtown for just $1.75.

I had booked a room at the back of the hotel given that the road at the front is really busy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the downside of this is that you get a view of the Holiday Inn on the other side of the alley out the back, rather than the Space Needle, but this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t such a big deal. However, as mentioned by others, there seem to be trucks going down the road at the back of the hotel in the early hours of the morning which woke us up a couple of times. I would describe the location of the hotel as being just beyond the edge of downtown \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is close to the Seattle Centre/Space Needle and quite easy to walk into the city centre in about 20 minutes and it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t far from the edge of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free ride\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bus zone. A tip for others staying here is that the route 99 bus is free all day (not just peak hours) and is also free along the length of its route rather than just in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free ride\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it goes past many of the sights and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too long a walk from the hotel. The taxi ride from the airport cost about $45 and the check-in was quick and easy (even got some water and cookies for being a Priority Club member!). The hotel is quite modern, and we had a one bedroom suite (with a completely separate bedroom) which was fine for our needs as it allowed us to be in one room and the baby to sleep in the other. The bed was comfortable and the bedroom was clean. It was also great that free wifi was available. The only downside was that the kitchenette wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really sufficient to prepare any food for our baby \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there were no utensils provided beyond plastic knives/forks/plates, although the fridge came in handy for storing her food. Talking of food, the breakfast buffet was the standard Holiday Inn Express fare, which I happen to like! It was good that fruit was provided as well as the less healthy options. The breakfast room is quite small given the size of the hotel, but although it was always busy we never had to wait. The staff there did a great job in ensuring that everything was kept stocked. We chose the Holiday Inn Express rather than the Holiday Inn next door as the Express had a swimming pool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we ended up only using this once (too much to see in Seattle!) but it was a great facility to have and the temperature was lovely. We got a great rate of $140 per night through the Intercontinental \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Friends and Family\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scheme as one of my friends works for them in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you know someone who works for the hotel chain you get a good discount (I shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that you could google \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intercontinental hotels friends and family\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but.....) Car parking is an extra $10 per night, but we only picked up the rental car towards the end of our stay from the nearby Avis given how easy it is to get around Seattle on foot/by public transport. We had read about the problems using the underground carpark so we parked at street level \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there seemed to be a few spare spaces. The restaurant in the Holiday Inn (Emerald Grill) wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we tried it once as Priority Club members get a discount. We stood there for 5 minutes as 3 staff walked by without even acknowledging that we were standing there. When we sat down we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given menus and were given a broken baby seat. The food was mediocre on top of this, so I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend the restaurant.

We enjoyed the typical HI express amenities which include triple-sheeted beds, comfortable linens/towels, and free breakfast. One of our rooms was a \"mini suite\" which had one queen bed, a sofa with pull-out, coffee table, computer desk, microwave, and mini-fridge. It had a nice view of the space needle from the window (see photo). The other room was just a regular room with 2 Qs. Both rooms got good free in-room wifi which is always a plus when you are sightseeing. The location was excellent, just a few blocks walk to the \"Seattle city center\" area which has the space needle, pacific science center, emp/sci fi museum, and many restaurants. There is a monorail there that you can take to get within walking distance of the pike market, so overall you are pretty nicely situated to walk or use public transportation to numerous sights and restaurants. This HI Express backs up to a \"regular\" Holiday Inn and they share the same parking garage which was a bit tight to get into and around with our rental minivan, but we managed. The parking has a fee of $10 a day, but I don't think the hotel actually charged our account for that. The rooms at this hotel, like the parking, are tight. We had 2 younger children with us in the mini-suite and had requested a rollaway bed which was promptly provided. However, there was absolutely nowhere to put it in this small room! So we ended up putting one child on the unextended sofa, putting the coffee table on end in the closet area, and then opening the rollaway in the coffee table's normal space. We could barely get by without tripping over the rollaway bed, but I guess it is a small price to pay for not listening to kids kick each other during the night. We were not charged for the rollaway either. The breakfast was typical HI Express - there was 1 hot option each morning, scrambled eggs and bacon, or eggs with biscuits and gravy. There was a nice assortment of muffins (the chocolate-chocolate-chip scored well with my crowd) and cinnamon rolls. Also, cereal, yogurt, milk, juice, coffee, and apples or bananas. The hotel does have an on-site restaurant, which as priority club members we were given a 10% off coupon for, but we did not go since its reviews were nothing special. The people at the front desk were friendly and efficient. Although the rooms (and the parking) were tight, they met our needs and were clean and comfortable. There is a small indoor pool.

There is a Monorail by the Space Needle that for $4 takes you Downtown in about 3 minutes. That is a fun experience, but not worth taking everyday, as it takes about 10 minutes to walk Downtown. If you want to get to Pike Place Market and other Downtown attractions, you'll walk about 20 minutes from the hotel.

It's about 15-20 minute walk down to Pike Place Market, the real highlight of this city. Your best bet is to go down Battery to 1st Avenue. You will avoid most of the numerous homeless people that plague downtown Seattle. The room was very clean, breakfast was great, though very crowded. We only parked a car for 1 night, and after getting stuck at the end of the parking lot, we got a spot that fit our sedan rental. Parking is tight, but the price is not bad. I did a lot of research before going on this trip - months of research. I encourage anyone who enjoys walking to stay at this hotel and save some cash. I didn't find the monorail to be helpful in getting down to Pikes Place Market, it is better for the shopping district only. SafeCo Field was about 2 miles from the hotel and we walked to two games while we were there, not bad at all, as long as you take the right route.

My only two minor complaints are that the bathroom was rather small, and the indoor parking spaces ($10 per night) were also too small to fit a standard/full size sedan and most people ended up taking two spaces.

We were only staying at this hotel for one night. The location is very close to the Space Needle / Experience Music Project. Right out front is Aurora Avenue, a confusing intersection, and a long tunnel entrance. Driving around the immediate area was very confusing because you cannot cross parts of Aurora due to the tunnel entrance. The Denny Street intersection one block south is another very confusing intersection too. Other than the noisy confusing location, the hotel is a great location just out of the main downtown area and still close enough to walk practically anywhere downtown if you're up to it. We walked from the hotel all the way down to the Aquarium in a short period of time. The hotel has 6 floor and two elevators, both of which were VERY slow. We gave up many times and just took the stairs, even though we were staying on the top floor. They seriously need to put in some more dependable, faster ones. The hotel also has underground parking for $10 a night, but we did not use it. When you first enter the lobby, it looks a little blah...not much decoration for such a large space. The front desk clerks were very nice and helpful including Kaleena! She helped us arrange buses to and from the Mariner's game way on the other side of downtown. They even stored our luggage when we were not in the room and away from the hotel. On the ground floor, the hotel offers a nice warm swimming pool, but surprisingly, no hot tub. Just adjacent to the pool is the breakfast room which was very busy and was hard to find a table at times. The food was very good, just like most Holiday Inn Express's since they have the same menus. The rooms were a little on the small side with the bathrooms being the smallest. Wow, I think they were the smallest bathrooms that I had ever used! The rooms were very clean though, nice housekeeping staff. Top floor rooms have a partial view of the city on the backside and the Space Needle on the front side. For one night, the rooms were fine. If you're not too worried about glitz and glamour such as the Fairmont Olympic and other 4 & 5 star hotels downtown, this place isn't too bad for the price. Everything in Seattle is expensive so we weren't too shocked at the over $100 price tag on the rooms. Compared to other hotels in the immediate area, this was certainly the nicer. It's a safe area and close to most attractions. Would I return, mmmm, probably not, just because there is such a wide selection of other hotels that I would love to try.

I splurged for a King suite with jacuzzi tub - it was great to have the extra space - basically a standard bedroom that had a sofabed, with a smaller bedroom connected with a door. We did look out the back at the adjacent Holiday Inn, but the extra space made up for the lack of a view. The oversized jacuzzi tub was great - like having our own hot tub! Internet worked well, but does require an ethernet cable. I have just started carrying one with me all the time. There is also a small business center in the lobby with two computers and printers - great for printing boarding passes. The kids (and I) enjoyed the indoor pool that was actually heated. True, it's not huge, but it is ample. Hey, it's the only decent hotel in the downtown area that has a pool. You can walk to the Space Needle and adjacent museums and amusement park in 5 minutes. It's an easy walk with signals to cross streets. You can also walk to a bus stop in the downtown free bus ride zone in about 5-10 minutes. The free ride zone covers a large area. You really don't need a car here. We worked our way down to the waterfront one evening and had a great meal at Fishermans. We took a cab back and it was only $10, including a $2 tip.

We ate a dinner at the adjacent Holiday Inn - fairly plain food, but kids eat free - nice budget break during a two-week trip! I used the washer/dryer facilities one night - the detergent machine took my money - the front desk staff gladly gave me a box without question. Hint - if you have to have a rental car while in Seattle, reserve it from the downtown location - you can save ~$90 in taxes on a week's rental. It pays for the cab ride to the rental location and the town car ride from the HIExpress back to the airport and more. The hotel will arrange a town car to take you to the airport for a $30 flat rate - less than a metered cab fare. I would stay at this hotel again and highly recommend it for the staff service, pool, location near the Seattle Center complex (space needle, museums, etc) and proximity to the real downtown, considering the rates.", "Date": "July 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arizona", "Title": "\u201cPotential Peepers-with little hotel concern\u201d", "Author": "biznestravler", "ReviewID": "UR8050965", "Content": "This was a mixed bag, but included one of the more disturbing moments in all of my stays at a hotel. I was in a room facing another hotel (Quality Inn I believe) and the Space Needle behind it. One night while in my room I was gazing out of my window at the space needle when I noticed a dark silhouette of a person pacing back and forth on the opposing hotel roof. As I looked closer I noticed the person had a camera and could see the red light blinking occationaly indicating he was in fact taking pictures, I can only assume at the windows in the Holiday Inn Express. Concerned I called the front desk immediately and informed the front desk clerk. To my astonishment, my concerns were all but disregarded as he informed me they were quite busy and he would call the other hotel when he had a moment. Appalled I asked for the number to call myself and did just that to inform the Quality Inn someone was on their roof, apparently taking pictures of the guests at the HIE. When I checked out, I once again explained the situation and my disbelief in the quality of response. This person was much more appologetic and responsive and did give me a follow-up call after I checked out saying they were checking into it with the other hotel. I understand things happen, and the person taking pictures was not on the roof of the Holiday Inn Express. What I can NOT understand is how low a priority catching a person peeping on your guests is given. I am a business traveler and was traveling alone. I don't imagine the guy was taking pictures of someone like myself...but to imagine someone taking pictures of my wife, daughter or mother is very upsetting. To not do anything about it-is infuriating!

There are no proper curtains! The windows are dressed with a sheer curtain and curtain panels on either side, the panels don't move, so if you'd like an afternoon nap, or a long lie-in it's going to be difficult as you can't block out the light. Aurora Avenue N has a barrier all along the centre of it so you have to cross the street at the junction south of the hotel (Denny Way), no big deal, unless you're really tired from lots of walking and you can see your hotel but just have to walk that little bit further to get to it.

The rooms overlooked the Space Needle and were very clean if a bit small.

We walked into the city centre a couple of times and it took about 25 minutes but was quite pleasant.

The room I had was small and faced Aurora, a very busy and loud street. The Space Needle hovered outside my window about 2 blocks away. Between the rain and the fan on the heater it drowned out most of the noise. Even though small the room was clean and comfortable, refigerator, coffee pot were in good shape. The attached restaurant, the Emerald Club was good for a sandwich and a beer. To me this was a typical Holiday Inn - almost like a McDonalds hamburger, about the same no matter where you are...
