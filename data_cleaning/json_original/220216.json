It is very well located, making it easy to walk to the Boston Common, Newbury Street, and downtown. Other parts of the city can be reached by taxi, which are not overly expensive compared to some other destinations. Beacon Hill itself is enchanting, with shops, cafes, and beautiful architecture. Our room was on a street corner several floors up, giving us a great view of the intersection near the hotel and providing plenty of light into the room. The room itself was relatively small but very comfortable, with a great bed and modern bathroom facilities. Our room was at one extremity of the hotel, making Wifi unreliable but there is a quiet lounge area on the second floor in the hotel where the Wifi can be accessed without problem. One of the best parts of our stay was the bistro on the main floor of the restaurant. It is decorated in a simple but classic style that fits very well into Beacon Hill's feel. The food was excellent, and the bar is a great place to relax after a day of walking around the city. The breakfasts were incredible. They were included with the room but you are able to choose anything from the bistro's breakfast menu. This is no continental breakfast - during our stay we had everything from the standard eggs and hash-browns (with toasted warm sourdough bread) to pancakes and yogourt with granola and fresh fruit. The hotel also has a roof-top patio with chairs and tables. A great place to sit and people watch, and the site of our engagement! Parking is a little tricky since the hotel is located in a dense, historic neighbourhood. Parking at the nearby Boston Common was cheap enough, and since you can get around on foot or taxi it is good place to leave your car during your stay. We strongly recommend the Beacon Hill Hotel and Bistro and look forward to our next stay - for us, the hotel itself is worth the visit to Boston.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montour Falls, New York, United States", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location and amazing Breakfast!\u201d", "Author": "ekelly_12", "ReviewID": "UR126039219", "Content": "Great location a block from Boston Common and Parking at Boston Common.

I enjoyed Beacon Hill so much (and Charles street in particular) that I decided to give it a try, and I am truly happy I did so! I stayed in the smallest room, and though it s indeed small, it is by no means claustrophobic (there were 2 windows), you could perfectly move around the double bed, and it was cleverly designed enough to include a tiny closet (with ironing board and all) and a desk. The bathroom was sizable enough to what you would find in bigger hotel rooms. All in all, size was adequate for a single person or a couple without much luggage. Everything was spotless clean and the bed was very comfortable. And for Boston cold weather, the heater (room and bathroom) worked perfectly, and you instantly got hot water (I wish I had that at home). Location is of course perfect, one of the quaintest streets in one of Boston's prettiest (and wealthiest) neighborhoods. The street is lined with small restaurants and shops, and is walking distance to Boston's main attractions and shopping. Last but not least, the hotel restaurant serves delicious food, as attested by the locals who fill the place from breakfast to dinner. The staff is friendly, attentive and ever helpful, which only adds to the feeling that you are staying at a good friend's place in Boston rather than in a hotel. If this is the experience and service you are looking for, you will definitely enjoy your stay here.

After trying some average hotels scattered throughout areas like Back Bay and the South End, I decided to try out BHHB. My search ended here. This place was the best! Their cozy and quaint rooms make you feel like your in the comfort of your own home. But probably their strongest attribute had to be the attentiveness of the staff.

We arrived in the evening after a long flight and went straight to bed. When we tried to go to breakfast the next morning, we could not open our door as the lock had jammed. We called reception and somebody came and let us out. After breakfast, we could not get back into the room either, so we had to call for help again. In the end we were given a different key and while we were out that day they called a locksmith to fix the lock. It was still sticky but at least we could open the door OK. We received a personal apology from the hotel owner and the staff were all very apologetic, so we felt they handled the problem reasonably well. The other problem is that our room was immediately above the restaurant on the corner of the street, so in the evening there was quite a lot of noise from the restaurant (until closing time) and from the street, although there was much less noise overnight. Using ear plugs we had no trouble sleeping, and a combination of jetlag and eagerness to explore Boston meant we were up early anyway. The room itself was clean, fairly spacious and simply but comfortably furnished, with a decent bathroom and reasonably large closet where we could stash our suitcases. No bug problems (contrary to reports from other hotels in Boston), thankfully. Breakfast in the bistro was great, with a good menu, excellent quality food and friendly service, and we found the staff generally to be friendly, efficient and helpful e.g. when taking our luggage to the room on arrival. We also ate in the restaurant one evening, which was a very pleasant experience. The location is great, on the edge of Beacon Hill and about 3 minutes' walk from the Public Gardens, which provided a very pleasant 10 minute walk to the Arlington MBTA Green line station, so it was very easy to get around. As others have indicated, this is a small hotel (or \"restaurant with rooms\") so you need to have realistic expectations, and it is quite expensive even by Boston standards.

Yes, the rooms are small and the street traffic can get noisy (amphibious duck tours, Boston? Really?), but anyone reading these reviews should already be aware of those limitations and understand the nature of the hotel: It's a small inn, whose first-floor restaurant takes up the property's footprint, with four floors of undersized (by conventional standards) rooms upstairs, with the added bonus of a third-floor terrace. I had a corner room with a bit more square footage than others, but none of the other rooms I saw seemed uncomfortably tight, just efficiently compact, at least for one person. The wainscoting and trim showed a little wear; it's obviously been a few years since the last refresh, and the bathroom tile and bathtub caulk seams were a bit worn and discolored. None of this really bothered me, although other reviewers who think that condition isn't worthy of a $300+ room have a point. (If I weren't traveling on business, I might have a slightly lesser opinion.) Much of my overall impression was influenced the convenience and quality of the restaurant and bar downstairs, particularly the breakfast (minus some absentminded service).

I didn't know where to start when booking a hotel in Boston as all the usual websites were giving me big corporate hotels but I wanted something a bit more boutiquey. I couldn't have done better than the Beacon Hill Hotel & Bistro. For a start, Beacon Hill is without doubt the most beautiful place to stay in Boston. It has a lovely old-world charm and walking along the cobbled stones amongst the beautiful houses and niche shops, with the gas lamps alit, really makes you feel relaxed and like you're on holiday! Have a walk round the corner to Louisburg Square - the houses are fantastic, apparently this is where John Kerry lives. Back to the hotel... what can i say it's very pretty, staff are incredibly attentive. Agree that the rooms are small, although similarly to others we were out exploring most of the time, but I would think if you're here for more than a couple days that you would need more wardrobe space than is provided. However the room is well equipped with all you need despite the size. On arrival our TV was not working properly, but the staff soon had someone in to look at it while we went out and it was fixed on our return. We only ate breakfast in the Bistro, which was complimentary with our stay and it was very good - i had the pancakes, with extra bacon & my husband had the waffles and we shared some fruit - it was all beautifully presented and very tasty - a good set up to our day's exploring! The following morning we had a very early start to the airport and the staff had prepared us some bagels and cream cheese to take with us! As for Boston, we found it to be a fairly small city - we walked everywhere! Shopping is limited so I wouldnt' recommend it for a shopping trip, but if you like history it's a definite! We did the duck tour which was fun, lots of walking and were going to do the MIT tour but it was closed as it was Veteran's Day. As for eating - if you like shellfish you will be in heaven! We tried the Union Oyster House - the oldest restaurant in Boston and my husband was in heaven over the lobster. My prawns were also gorgeous! On our second evening we went for a fine dining experience at Antonys Pier 4 on the harbourside. This restaurant has old school charm and there is a whole wall of photos of famous people who have eaten here - Liz Taylor, The Kennedy's etc! The seafood here was fabulous - you can see the live lobsters and they are HUGE! We both felt thoroughly stuffed when we left and it was super value - $120 including tax and 20% service, which included king prawns for starter (for both of us), whole lobster for him and Sole stuffed with lobster for me. Jacket potoates, salads, breads etc and drinks (although no alcoholic drinks). Overall I would say The Beacon HIll HOtel & Bistro is the perfect base for exploring Boston.", "Date": "December 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel, but don't order the duck!\u201d", "Author": "jth", "ReviewID": "UR10364131", "Content": "A wonderful boutique hotel in a super area in Boston.

The rates at first seemed high, but Boston Hotels are very pricey and it turned out to be the cheapest rate of the Hotels we considered.

We've been to Boston before so didn't feel the need to stay longer (had a fabulous meal at Bricco's in North End!). We stayed in one of the Queen rooms.

The bathroom was spotless and well equipped (a real plus for my wife!). What we really loved was the character of the room. We've stayed at hotels twice the price and they are just modern and sterile. The downstairs bar was small and inviting with good range of wines, beers and spirits considering it's size.
