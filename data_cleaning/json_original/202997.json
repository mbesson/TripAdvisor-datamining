We went with another couple and between the 2 rooms here are the problems. Both rooms stunk terribly, one shower did not work at all. Out balcony door did not work and we advised the staff who came up and took off the lock period and left it so that the patio door did not close at all, air conditoning made a lot of noise but did not work at all in either room, and fridges were disgusting and did not work in either room. Breakfast was suprisingly decent, and the lobby is in decent conditon, which sort of sucked us in.

It does have a great location for getting around the city,so that is the one plus I can give it.On check-in we had no problems,but the front desk staff were indifferent if not rude. I had specifically requested a room away from the streetside in earlier emails to the hotel and was assured they could acommodate us. What did we get? The only room overlooking the street with a balcony.and it was horrible. Stained spread on the bed,filthy shower curtain,nasty,dirty furniture...and I refused to take the room. My husband was embarrassed,but I went right back to the front desk to ask for a room change. When I was asked what was wong with the room I replied 'What's RIGHT about it? It's filthy.' The porter was called back and given another set of keys to show us another room. We where taken almost as far away from the front desk as we could get to the new section,where everything was brand new and the marble bathroom perfect. More of what I expected....About the heat thing? Our room was FREEZING as well,and the heater wouldn't turn on for us. When we called the front desk to ask how to get it to work,we were told it was 'too early' in the winter (this was mid-November)to use the heat and they'd bring us extra blankets if we wanted. HUH??? I had to go out and buy a heavy robe to wear to sleep in as it was impossible to get warm under 2 sets of blankets and a bedspread. The night before we checked out,the heat 'magically' went on and we had the first good night's sleep we'd had the whole 5 days we were there. I never heard any of the other guests complain about being cold, so I have to believe it was in retaliation for my room change....and because I've read about other people having similar problems...heat controlled by the front desk computer??I would never stay in this hotel again,mostly because of the staff.

So what was it? Just a general feel of the place, I think. An attitude. In a busy city like Florence, the hotel should be a kind of oasis, where you're happy to return after dodging tourists and traffic. This simply wasn't it.

After reading previous reviews, I was slightly sceptical about staying at the Bonciani for two nights.It does possess old world charm which is on the verge of being shabby, particularly the dirty hand prints on the walls in the lobby.

The lift is quite small only holding 4 'small' people, or 2 people with suitcases.My double room was 'compact' but the bed was comfortable and there was plenty of hot water for the shower. My mini-bar fridge was working but they only put bottled water in it. The TV has about 10 channels with CNN and BBC World being the only English speaking ones.I was on the third floor and had a balcony overlooking the busy street below. I didn't find the noise too bad although I was woken up at 6am by the street cleaning crew. Rooms seemed pretty soundproof as I didn't hear my neighbours.Breakfast is served 7-10am and was actually quite good. A mixture of cereals, yoghurt, boiled eggs, bread rolls, ham, cheese, chocolate spread and jams, croissants and danish pastry. There is orange juice, but it is mixed from powder, and the coffee tasted lousy after having nice cappuccinos elsewhere.If you are looking for a hotel close to the railway station and a 5 minute walk away from the Duomo, where you will be out all day and are just looking for somewhere to rest your head, then the Bonciani is what you need.", "Date": "Mar 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR870307751", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "///"}, {"Content": "Ask for room 460       Looking out of the room", "Date": "Mar 21, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR819700724", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Do Not Stay Here! Terrible Hotel Our stay at the Bonciani was brief, as we would not have stayed more than 1 night. First off, we just randomly stayed there because we were walking by it... I was pretty shocked to come and see everyone's review basically mirroring exactly what I was going to write. However, there were a few other events which made our stay even worse. The staff was pretty much indifferent, I didn't get rudeness until checking out. Our room was very cold when we got in, so I turned up the heat, as they had set it low. After another hour or so, there was no difference in room temperature so I called the desk. He said he was going to set it higher from his computer at his desk where they apparently impose an additional limit to the already limited thermostat in the room. Needless to say it never got a single degree warmer. When we'd checked in, we asked for the room guaranteed to be the quietest room they have available. They gave us one overlooking a really scummy set of rooftops complete with plenty of trash, barbed wire, and grime instead of one on the road, fair enough. We were not expecting there to be demolition or construction in the room right next to ours! At 8 AM sharp, they began an incessant hammering and crashing in the room which lasted for 2 hours solid. When we checked out and brought up these two facts, they of course said the room just wasn't cold, that we were exaggerating (I'm from Wisconsin, and I prefer cool sleeping conditions, trust me it was frigid), and that they had no idea there would be construction going on in the neighboring room, BUT that it wasn't supposed to be starting until 10:00 AM?! Oh and also, the breakfast does suck. It's about equal to breakfast in a cheap hostel. And the general ambience is seedy, the carpet and wallpaper is torn, dust everywhere, etc. Should probably be a 2-star classification, not the 3-star that they have on their sign.
