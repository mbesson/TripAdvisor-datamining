It pays to do your home work. We knew exactly what to expect and got more than we expected. We found the walk down the \"alley\" perfect. One minute you are on the main noisey tourist crowded bridge in front of the Antico Doge, and with in a few steps.. complete quiet was you walk through the metal gate to the courtyard in front of the entry door. Yeah the building next door is boarded up and run down, but half of Venice is the same way with or with out boards. The double flight of stairs to the main lobby only add to the intrigue. It's like you're entering someones old venetian house. which you are! it is conviently located to the Rialto bridge. Easy walk from the Ca D'oro boat stop.. We did splurge and take a private water taxi back to the airport. pick up was by the bridge out front 30 minutes to the airport. we spent 4 nights there with two friends. we booked the Junior Suite and the Triple room respectively (we decided for size and not the canal view) The Junior Suite is HUGE. With a view of the construction chute out one side of the window and the Courtyard below on the other side (oh well who stays in the room and looks out the window anyway) The bath room is huge as well. Our room was so big, we had our friends over the share breakfast at the sitting table, we loved the breakfast. Stefano was so accomodating with everything. breakfast was simple enough, Juice, coffee, rolls, jams. We added to it by getting fruit and sliced meats from the market. The room floor was so crooked it was funny. I read some complaints about this, but again it adds to the charm. Beautiful Glass chandeliers in the rooms. My only issue/concern was the bathroom in the triple room. More specifically the bath tub. very small old style. last time I saw one was 20 years ago in an old B&B in Belgium. you sit in a \"well\" big enough for your legs,and then a higher up \"well\" for you butt. anyone of any height or girth is not gonna fit! love this place and would recommend it to any one who appreciates a place with Character and not be fussy.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bath, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBe careful\u201d", "Author": "philedge", "ReviewID": "UR127861985", "Content": "OK, we have just got back from a short break here, The good news is that it is well located and the staff polite.

It had a pile of wood and was very dusty and damp from the canal swilling in from the far end of the hall. The reception is two floors up and looked fine, with rooms off the reception area. BUT our room was off the hall 2 floors below. It was large and quite grand, but with chairs that were repaired and with unsuitable springs!!. The room was at canal level and very noisy from pasing water traffic until late at night and from 0600. The traffic is very heavy duty delivery and waste collection boats, with some water taxi and gondola traffic. Our guess is that the main rooms are fine, BUT you must make sure you are not in this one, if you want good sleep. This is a B&B, not an hotel and room services are minimal.

They say Turner used to paint here and you can understand why he must have loved this little hotel so much! The location couldn't be more convenient. Next to the Rialto, it is clean and the rooms have their individual, Venetian charm, with Murano glass lights and Burano lace on the table. Breakfast is brought to the room, so you can once again enjoy the wonderful views over the Canal Grande and the Rialto market. You get your own set of keys for the entire hotel, so even if you come home very late there is no worry you might not get in anymore. This also allowed us to spend Sunday without dragging our suitcases with us, but we could leave them in the hotel and pick them up at our own accord. Stefano is so lovely, so kind and helpful we could have not asked for a more charming host. He really tries to meet every wish and accomodate any individual request.

We opted for a standard room which didnt have a canal view but we were there for 3 days and not intending to be in the room much so that wasn't a problem - 130euro for a double room in Venice is not to be sniffed at. The bed was comfy, the bathroom clean and the shower hot so no complaints there. We both had smart phones which hooked up easily to the free internet provided so that was a major plus. Breakfast.....well, 3 days of coffee and croissants filled with apricot jam got a bit boring but we were in the cheap seats so maybe others had more variety but this would be our only minor gripe.

We were very fortunate to have a room over looking the Grand Canal which was mesmorising to watch. In the afternoons, we would buy some drinks and snacks and take them back to our room - open up the doors and watch the boats go by. Was so relaxing after a busy day of sightseeing before heading out for dinner. The hotel is central - close to shops, water taxi/boat stops, gondola rides, restaurants and Rialto Bridge. Our price was good. Our room was so full of character - it is old style and decorated to suit with what I would describe as timber provincial furntiture. The walls slope, the floors slope, the door slope, but it was so in fitting with the building, with Venice and with our expectations that it became part of the fun. The room was really large - we certainly had room to spread and were really comfortable there - as I said we had drinks near the window each night. It wasn't by any means modern or new, but we didnt want or expect that for Venice. I would describe this hotel as more of a B and B. We also had access to free wireless internet. There was no TV.

It was near great shopping without being in the middle of the marketplace. We stayed there April 29, 2011, the day before we left for a cruise. Stefano was terrific, with his internet communications and directions in making arrangements prior to our stay, and in taking care of our needs. This is a small 8 room historic hotel, more of a bed and breakfast as it does not have a restaurant. There is no lift, but Stefano carried our luggage up the stairs to the lobby with ease! The hotel is a short walk from the Ca d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Oro vaporetto stop, and there is only one small bridge to cross. It is in a very nice shopping district and not far to the Rialto Bridge and shopping areas there, and probably 10-15 minutes pleasant walk to Piazza San Marco. I had requested a Canal view room as this was a special trip for my husband and I. Stefano made sure we had a wonderful room. Our room was very large, decorated with what appeared to be antique Italian furniture, high ceilings, a lovely Italian glass chandelier and beautiful decorative carpet, with a small table and chairs in a large area overlooking the canal, and a very nice modern bath with tub/shower ensuite. The room had two large windows, with false iron balconies and wooden shutters overlooking the Grand Canal across from the Mercado Rialto and near the gondola crossing. I could see part of the Rialto Bridge from my window. It was fascinating to me to watch \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Main Street\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Venice as the various boats and water taxis and gondolas passed by. There is an air conditioner in the room but we did not need it. The bed was adequately firm without being hard. Stefano served us a delightful continental breakfast in our room the following morning. There is some noise from the Canal; my husband and I enjoyed this, since we wanted to experience the activity on the canal and watch the coming and going of all the boats and people, but if you want a quiet room you might want to look for a room off the Grand Canal. The market deliveries start around 7:00 along with the church bells, and though it is not loud you can hear the bustling of Venice beneath your window as the city winds down at night and wakens in the morning. Stefano provided us with a map and great directions, though we found Venice is not so hard to navigate and quite beautiful to explore on foot.

This was our first holiday without our son in three years! Needless to say, we so needed to get everything right. And we did. After looking at various options, including 4-5 star hotels in Mestre, we decided it had to be Venice. We read through most reviews in tripadvisor.com and caught a glimpse of the Leon Bianco in episode 1 of Kevin McCloud's Grand Tour series (http://www.youtube.com/show/kevinmccloud%27sgrandtour?s=1). I cannot tell you how happy I was our instincts were right. You see, most reviews at the time of the booking ranged from good to excellent, but there were a few abysmal ones. Now, the bad reviews were complaining about the exact things the good reviews were raving about. Something didn't feel right. So, here's our view, fresh from the holiday: Stefano, the guy who runs the locanda, is very friendly, helpful and punctual. The rooms are cleaned daily to an exceptional standard, and we are very fussy with such things. The location is fantastic, Ca' d' oro and the Rialto are a 2.5 min walk (I timed this), San Marco is a mere 15 minutes. We got breakfast in bed on the dot each day, as promised. Our room (Room 6, with windows on a side canal) was good, although probably not the best one in the hotel, judging from glimpses of other ones. Because of the way the tourist path swerves away from its location and because the rooms are quite high up in the building, our room was also pretty quiet, considering how central the location is. The only sound we could hear was the occasional gondola or speedboat going past at night. Mind you, having the right expectations goes a long way: we had done our research and this made a huge difference. Venice is SO expensive, so Leon Bianco is actually good value. Buildings in Venice are old. We had a lovely marble floor and wooden venetian styled furniture in the room. There is a definite 'old world' feel to the hotel (and Venice, in general) which adds to its charm. The bathroom was very clean and modern. At the same time, I should probably mention: there are three flights of stairs to climb until you get to the hotel. Venice, in general, is not such an easy place with a buggy (in case you're bringing one). The wifi signal was very poor in our room. When we first arrived, we spent about 10 unnecessary minutes walking in circles trying to find the entrance to the hotel (hint to guests: push past the often closed black metal door, the entrance is to your right -- hint to Stefano: a discreet wooden 'Leon Bianco' sign perpendicular to the wall wouldn't hurt, either). And, apart from breakfast, there was no room service during the rest of the day. But so what? If you cannot tell the difference between an old marble floor which has been spotlessly cleaned and a dirty floor, then this hotel is not for you. You may also want to consider choosing a different destination, altogether.

There was just a small sign on the list of doorbells saying \"Locanda Leon Bianco.\" It wasn't even a real hotel!

We had to lug our enormous suitcases up only to discover the rest of the place was even more of a dump!

He started shouting--really loudly shouting!-- saying he was going to call the police and that we were not allowed to leave. He demanded that we pay him right then and there, even if we didn't stay. By this point my children were terrified and I wasn't completely sure I would make it back down the stairs with my huge suitcase without him pushing me down. It was that bad. I immediately called my husband and he booked us another room and stopped payment on our card for the Leon Bianco. We just found out that we have to pay because we had reserved it in advance.

We are a married couple in our mid-thirties and spotted the hotel on the Channel 4 TV show Kevin McLoud's Grand Tour. Mr McLoud stayed in the Turner room at the hotel, the room where the painter JMW Turner stayed during his Grand Tour, we visited the hotel website and booked up the Turner room (room #4). Immediately the email communication from hotel owner Stefano was friendly and useful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sending information on how to find the hotel, tips and answering special requests within 24 hours. Arriving at the airport we took the ACTV bus into Venice and caught the water-bus to the stop nearest the hotel. The 31EURO 72 hour ACTV pass is a must and great value getting around. Once we arrived at the bus-stop we followed Stefano's simple instructions and found the Hotel, a 5-6 minute walk. The travellers on here who had problems finding the hotel clearly cannot read a map. The stairs up to the hotel (it only has 7 rooms) were a real insight into Venetian architecture and the structure of their buildings, after a couple of flights they opened into a beautiful reception with a smiling Stefano waiting to greet us. Check-in was easy and we were given front door keys, room keys and shown our room which was wonderful. Bright and large with 2 large windows opening out onto the Grand Canal, another large window opening onto another canal that runs along the side of the hotel. The room was clean, included a fridge, hair dryer and all your basic necessities. There was no TV, including one there would be a travesty, sitting in front on your window with a nice glass of Cabernet Franco watching the world go by is entertainment enough and I can see why Turner wanted to sketch it. The bathroom was clean and well stocked, beds comfy, lots of storage space and a safe to use. It's basic but it is perfect. My only slight issue was that the room was a little cold but the weather was freezing outside so we just wore another layer. Stefano met all of our requests: extra pillows, wine glasses and a place to store our bags after checkout on the last day. He brings you breakfast in the morning with a polite tap on your door.

The hotel is perfectly situated for the bus stop, local shops and restaurants, a beautiful church and all over the man sites. The market is a Gondola ride across the Grand Canal (1 EURO and 8 minutes door to door) and the Rialto bridge is a 5 minute walk. All-in-all the hotel felt like home and you really couldn't ask for much more than that. The people are friendly in the district and the prices aren't as expensive as they are as you get close to Piazza San Marco.

We'd passed another couple waiting below in the dark entryhall with their luggage - and wondered what it was they were waiting for. A very nice, effervescent lady in exhuberant colourful clothing - later to be known as Leila - offered us the sofa in the reception and rushed down the marble stairs. A minute later she was back up the stairs hauling one of their large cases - which wasn't much smaller than herself. \"That's why I advised you to wait for me\" she said to them, puffing slightly with a broad smile. This immediately impressed us - particularly as many times in Italy we'd been led, unaided, luggage in tow, up flights and flights of stairs without the slightest possibility of a helping hand from the perfectly groomed staff vigilant not to break a sweat! The other couple were probably on the road since the early hours like ourselves. Inbetween dealing with the other couple Leila stole a moment to thrust a bottle of water into my wife's hand. Then it was our turn to be received. To our further surprise she said \"We have three rooms that we can offer you. I'll give you a look and you can tell us which one you like the best.\" The basement one was recently refurbished and featured three windows letting out onto the Riva S.Apostoli. Remarkable. We could if we wished lie in bed and watch the Gondolas slide by at eye level. The next room - upstairs was less plush but also large with a good bathroom. It overlooked the same canal as the basement did and if you looked out the widow, to the left you could even see the Grand Canal itself. We were already impressed before she showed us the next - with some trepidation referring to it as the \"Funny Room\". A huge space with a bizarre mural featuring some moorish looking scene with camels! We were once again - to her astonishment - impressed. This room overlooked the rear of the hotel and the small campo. She left us then to ponder our dilemma. Each room was great in different ways - even the 'funny one' (\"What - you mean you like it?\"). After 20 minutes We went for the 1st floor one overlooking the rio. We ended up having a very nice stay and really feel that we'd return to the hotel on another trip. The breakfasts were monotnonous but it's pretty standard fare in Italy: overly refined croissants, rolls and jams. Italians don't really go in for breakfast anyway. 'When in Rome...' Leila even asked us that evening if \"you'd like more hot chocolate in the morning\" - we hadn't asked, she just thought to offer extra. The stairs where two steep flights. Other reviewers here have complained about them but if you're of average fitness there's no problem. It's all fun. My only quibble would be the wonky connection in the bedside lamp and the fan which didn't work in the bathroom. These are a minor number of faults based on previous experience and to be fair we forgot to to tell the hotel so they may not even be aware of them. It's amazing the number of faults you find in some places! We enquired on the last day about the Ca' DeMosto next door which was the original Albergo Leon Bianco and if TV presenter/Architect Francesco De Mosto might have bought it back to restore it. It looked from the outside as if an attempt to restore had got underway and then halted. They weren't sure if he now had it again - but that the De Mosto family had sold it way back in the 15th Century. Apparently it was the first palace on the Grand Canal and later a very famous hotel. Our hotel was a part of it during the 19th Century; JMW Turner the painter staying in Room 4 and the Emperor of Austria booked the whole building for himself. Behind the hotel, near Strada Nuova is where the ill-fated Doge Marin Falier had his palace before being executed for treason. The 'Unluckiest Doge'. We were sad to leave and I think if the basement room is anything to go by the rest of the hotel is probably soon to be renovated. Meaning, perhaps that it will become more expensive to stay in. We definitely recommend the Leon Bianco. It proved to us that the quality of the staff is, in a way, everything.

You are asked to keep your set of keys on you at all times - in order to get in late at night.

The breakfast brought to the room each morning was a bit mean (only 1 plate and 2 small butters) and predictable (same each day). My wife thought the bed too hard. We paid in cash - 210 Euros each night - as requested which is a bit steep just for a view of the Grand Canal and not much else.

After reading mostly good reviews of this guest house, went ahead and booked and we were not disappointed. The hotel gave good directions from the Ca d'Oro vaporetta stop. Don't be put off by the unpromising entrance - a rather musty stairwell then up some dark steps to a first floor lobby area. The first night we had a room overlooking the small canal which was fine but the next two nights we had a room overlooking the grand canal - well worth the extra euros. I was just going to book the smaller room for the whole stay as it was already slightly over our budget, but I'm just so glad I bit the bullet as it was such an experience. It was so beautiful just sitting watching Venice go by. People always look up at the balcony and wave. Lots to see at any time of the day. We didn't find it noisy as the large ceiling to floor windows shut out the noise and left the room very quiet. The staff were very helpful - especially Leila, who was very friendly and brought us our breakfast every morning. She also took a bottle of bubbly I had brought with us and put it in the freezer for a while and provided some lovely champange flutes. If you want all mod cons, internet access, mini bars, tvs etc, then this won't be for you. However, it's simple, spacious, clean and central and we loved it. Also, you can leave your luggage after you've checked out and pick it up at your convenience.

Selecting a Grand Canal view does not disappoint.

The manager (Stephano) and assistant (Layla) were very helpful and, in the morning, allowed us to leave our cases until the 2.00 check-in.

The thing that really impressed us was the warmth and friendliness of the owner, Leila. She was lovely to our three little girls, and couldn't have been nicer to us in general. For instance, we asked for a bottle opener; she brought us one along with two wine glasses. She put the children's bears in their beds each morning, gave them sweets (the children, not the bears), listened to their earnest prattle, and generally made us feel welcome.

Mists swirl round the courtyards and bridges and even the Piazza is quiet. If you want to tour the Doge's palace or see the Basilica in peace then now is the time to go. Locanda Leon Bianco is very well situated at the foot of the Strada Nova hard by the crumbling palace of the Ca' da Mosto teetering on the bank of the Grand Canal. Good eateries are within a short walk- do check out Il Milion and Fiaschetteria Toscana- and a canal fronting room is a delight to the eyes with Ponte Rialto just down on the left and the halls of fish and vegetable markets on the Rialto immediately opposite. But remember the Grand Canal is Venice's main highway and it is far from quiet. In January with shutters and windows closed the deep buzz of the vaporetto chugging past, the throb of the barges and the higher powered engines of motoscafi and police craft is not too off-putting. But boy, do those guys in the fish market make some noise. Shouting and whistling at one another from around six in the morning. On a hot Summer's night, with the added worry of mosquitoes, the canal facing rooms must be deafening and hot. Otherwise, this is a little gem even if you do have to drag your luggage up two flights of steep stairs to get to it. But the welcome is genuinely warm, breakfast is served in one's room as there is no dining room, and the placed is steeped in history.

Charged 165 euro per night for a Junior Suite, overlooking a very small courtyard. We stayed in Room 9, just inside the front door and beside the reception desk. Not a good choice, as the staff spent 2 hours chattering, between 8.00 & 10.00. Breakfast was served in the room as there was no dining room. Breakfast was typical continential, tea/coffee, orange juice, 2 mini rolls, croissant and melba toast per person. You were only given one small plate to share between 2 people.. Overall, our stay was fine, even if over-priced, until the last morning. We got up, as usual for breakfast at 9.45. We then lay back on the bed as we had a number of hours to pass, prior to our flight time. We got an angry knock on the door at 10.50, advising that latest check-out was 10.30 and that we had 10 minutes to leave the room. My wife packed the bags while I went to pay the bill. The hotel prefers cash, which I paid. The housekeeper inquired if we were involved in the hotel industry as the room had been kept in a spotless condition. She was amazed that my wife had made the bed so perfectly each morning ! We asked if we could leave our bags for a couple of hours and the hotel had no problem ! We returned about 3.00 p.m to be accosted by the housekeeper. She asked what we had done to the sheets ? She showed us a large cofffe stain on the sheet and said that the mattrerssses had been destroyed ! We stated that we did not know anything about what happed and that the room had been left open on our departure. I was put on the phone to Stefano who did not bother to call and see us ! We were never shown the damage to the mattress ! I replied that if we had caused damage to his property, that we were unlikely to leave our bags on the premises. I felt that I had explained the situation satisfactorily and we left. I received an e-mail from Stefano 2 days later which stated that all the other people in the hotel were old and that they would not have caused the damage. He was putting a 300 euro charge on my credit card. The subsequent e-mails from him have been aggressive ! I believe that htis is a con-job as we never caused any damage to hotel property and we were never shown the damaged mattress. The stain on the sheet was very dry.

This was in April 06. We booked because of recommendations on this site and Fodors.com. We booked directly with the hotel through email. In short if you can get Room #4 (with a balcony on the Grand Canal) then grab it. If not, find another hotel. We stayed in 3 different rooms in a 4 night stay. This was because room#4 was only available the middle two nights. This will allow for a good review because we got the full experience of the hotel. The location is good but not great. You are a 5-10 min walk from Rialto Bridge and a 3 min walk to the Ca'Doro Vaparetto stop. Our first impression of the area and hotel (this was our first time in Venice) was that it was dirty and stunk. We quickly forgot the smell/dirt of the streets as we greatly enjoyed our stay. It was difficult to find the hotel as the entrance is off a small walkway that enters into a dirty courtyard shared between the hotel and apts. We were buzzed in and walked up a dark flight of stairs to small lobby which is basically just a desk. Our first night was in room (#6)150E. This was on the small canal. It was a small, plain, dark room. But bathroom was big and great... very recently refurbished. No tv. Bed was fine. Room was very clean. View of small canal was not impressive. Outside was very loud on small canal. Motor boats go down canal all day/night and a garbage boat was loading starting very early 5amish just about 50 meters from our window. So first night was a dissapointment. Second two days were in room#4 (200E/night). This was a special room and special experience. Especially after the first night. Room has two very small balconies that overlook the grand canal. You can see the Rialto bridge. Only big enough for one person to sit on. We often just hung out in the room and watched venice life go by on the canal. One of our most memorable experiences from the trip. Breakfast is served in the room and is small, just bread, croissant, jam/butter and juice. But the best coffee on our trip. . It's included so take it. Room was clean and comfortable and very big. All rooms had hardwood floors and new bathrooms. Last night was in room#5 150E. This room was also on the side canal next to room#6. #5 was bigger and little better than #6. Closer to the grand canal and not quite as noisy as #6. Service was fine. We didn't ask for much. A good service note..on the way out once my wife commented to the desk on how much she liked the coffee. On check out they had a packet of the coffee for us to take home with us. Careful of the staircase, tends to be very dark and uneven stairs. Have to pay in cash. Management would be well served to clean up the courtyard outside the entrance. It leaves a very bad first impression. If not for the diry courtyard and nosiy room#6 (garbage boat in the early am) then it would be 5 stars.", "Date": "October 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "bucuresti", "Title": "\u201cBe carefull!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5432171", "Content": "a 3 days vacation reserved on internet.

Next day..everything ok. Breakfast in the room...very nice ideea, but not a very special breakfast (croissant, butter, coffe, marmelade).

In the last day at 11.00 just before checking out my husband has another problem with the stomac (be carefull with food in venice...is not very good - especially the tomato sauce) and i go ask the woman if she can give me some boilled water because i want to make a tea. She tells me...no water, no boiled water...no such service after the breakfast. I asked her..but the kitchen is open, is near us, here, why can't you give me some boilled water? I just want to make a tea. She start to scream at me - she made me impolite and when i asked \"and if a person is sick your hotel doesn't give him or her a cup of boilled water?\" She start to scream again and finally, before calling on the phone Stephano), when i told her to stop screaming at me she told me that she is in her country and i'm just a tourist and she makes what she wants in her country....
