The desk clerk informed me that nothing was found in that room. I told her that I was not calling to see if they found it that I was calling to let them know I was coming to get the item. Only person with access to the room would be housekeeping---it was obvious to me that housekeeping found my person item and stole it!

In the course of 4-5 weeks I spent over $1500. After I departed my card was charged for an additional night even though I checked out & received a statement saying I owed $0. After repeated calls I finally get the manager days later & tell him the problem. He said I owed another day which is far from the truth. He then went on to explain that I should have been happy to pay a reduced rate that I was being charged. Story behind that goes is that I was paying a rate of $34.99 daily but they had an ad on craigslist for $700 monthly. I took my tablet to his office & showed him the ad which he was unaware of but yet honored the price. So I failed to realize how I became so lucky to get an advertised rate. I even went so far to explain that when I paid on 12/24/11 there was a problem with me being charged twice. The front desk associate & housekeeper who was present at the time figured it out because as she stated it happened before but I was told he was not allowed to make those decisions. So I was being told again I owed money but nobody can tell me who,what,where,when or why. Don't get me wrong the staff is helpful Jimmy , Alberto & the nameless others that you come to depend on. When my belongings were locked in the safe for days the guy that continued to try & help me I thank him as well. I see that the manager replies here & I am sure he will have come up some reason why I owed the money when he says how this is all my fault. I have a final statement showing I owe $0 & had a previous problem on 12/24 with my account..

It sounds like the Ice machine has been down for a while. The hotel looks rather run down and outdated. The interiors are old. The bed spreads, sheets, and towels are old and extremely worn. One of our bed spreads even had holes burned in it. They ran out of towels on one of our three days. There could have only been 15 people staying in the hotel, but yet they didnt have any more towels. You could hardly call them towels though, because they were so worn out, torn, and small. The door was far from air tight, as I could see under the door and smell cigar smoke coming in under the door. The A/C units were noisy (our room and our friends room). The control switches on our unit were going bad and we had to mess around with them to get the AC to really cool the room. The shots used on the hotel website DO NOT represent what the hotel looks like now. I couldn't wait to get home and take a shower to feel clean again.

The best Mexican Restaurant anywhere is attached to the hotel. Like the hotel, the restaurant building is old but the food is excellent.
