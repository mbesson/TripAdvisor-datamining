The advertised photos of the room fitted with its description and were the reason I booked the hotel. When we opened the door to the room we thought we'd been given the wrong key as it was like walking into a cupboard. The room had a small pull out sofa bed with bedding for one made up which took up most of the room. After squeezing past this we found a single bed in the other equally small room. Given we'd booked a 40 sqm room with a double we returned to reception expecting to be given another set of keys to our actual room. Despite explaining the apparent mix up the receptionist advised us that that was our room and that she couldn't give us another room as the hotel was full but offered us 5 euro to make amends accepting that the advertised details for the room were misleading and that the photos on booking.com were off a larger more expensive room. Given this frank admission we asked whether we could cancel the booking but were told that wasn't possible and we would still have to pay for the room. Sensing our increasing frustration we were offered 10 euro to make amends. As you can imagine this went down like a lead balloon where upon the receptionist tried to justify the room saying we had booked a cheaper room and so could not expect it to be as nice as the more expensive rooms. Given the deadlock we asked her to call the manager and see what they could do thinking common sense would prevail. Disappointingly we were told the 10 euro offer stood and we could take it or leave it. Given we had already paid for the room we had no real option but to take the 10 euro. This is the worst hotel we have stayed in and I was appalled at the way we were treated when we were the ones who had been wronged. I do not recommedt that anyone stay here for the above reasons.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cGood value, great staff\u201d", "Author": "Gideon2NY", "ReviewID": "UR124696301", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel 3 times.

We had an almost-2 year old with us. The staff were very friendly and helpful - providing a child's bed and highchair as needed. Rooms were cleaned daily - to a high standard. The room and bathroom were spacious and clean - with a small bar-fridge. (no kettle or microwave included). Beds were comfortable and the breakfast buffet superb (even after 3 weeks of eating it!) Lots of choice - breads, cheese, meat, cereal, eggs, yogurt, juice, tea, coffee... Close to bus and s-bahn transportation. Located in a more-expensive area of town for restaurants and shopping - but if you go over a few streets, things are a little cheaper. No place for children to play (other than the room), but there are many fun parks around - just need to do a little exploring. The zoo is close-by. We brought a stroller with us, and it \"just\" fit into the tiny elevator... 1 person, kid in the stroller and stroller- tipped at an angle. If not - there are 4 flights of stairs to climb... which could be an inconvenience if you have a larger stroller (we have babyjogger city mini). Wi-fi worked well and was a good price. Very tiny television, with only BBC and CNN in English. No a/c, but fan provided. Very highly recommended - with one child.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cornwall", "Title": "\u201cPeaceful, friendly and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "Christysdad", "ReviewID": "UR57119287", "Content": "We found this hotel to have helpful and friendly staff, a peaceful and spacious room inc fridge (provide your own kettle and tea bags!) and a lovely buffet breakfast.

Very friendly & helpful reception (where I could leave my bag safely on the last day after checkout to catch a late train). I booked a single room but seemed to have been given a small double (2 single beds). Everything was very clean, good linen, spotless tiny but perfectly adequate bathroom with shower. A wallsafe and plenty of hangers in the cupboard. Breakfast was excellent value, especially considering it was included in the price I paid for the room (74 euros) and offered a wider selection than I would have expected (good cheeses, cold meats, hardboiled eggs, cereals, juices, breads and more). The location is excellent. Bleibtreustrasse crosses Ku'damm and is a street full of top fashion boutiques and restaurants. Continue along Bleibtreustrasse across the other side of Ku'damm and you'll come to the S-Bahn stop Savignyplatz which will link you to Berlin Hauptbahnhof...I trundled my overnight bag and didn't need a taxi. The only slight downside was that my room overlooked an internal courtyard of what I assume are privately owned apartments and, the weather being warm all windows were open, so one evening I had to listen to a loud conversation (very loud) which made sleep impossible. I was about to yell out of my window but they stopped on the stroke of midnight. By the way, make sure you check out the fascinating historic b/w photographs of Berlin that line the hotel's corridors.
