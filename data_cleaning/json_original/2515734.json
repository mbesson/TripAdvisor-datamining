Horrible Location.\u201d", "Author": "MikeP2K12", "ReviewID": "UR125557047", "Content": "I stayed here on business for 10 days at the end of January. I was supposed to stay for 60 days but I was smart enough to book in 10 day increments in case I didn't like the property. Here are the pros: 1) Big Rooms 2) Cheap Here are the cons: 1) These are not suites, they are one large room with no separation. 2) The staff is extremely unprofessional. I had an issue with a shower head that I'll get into in a minute. They wear whatever they feel like wearing to work and they are never at the counter. Usually playing on their phones in the back office with a tall wall mirror set against the door so they can see customers. There is absolutely no uniform. Usually skull caps and sweatshirts for the guys. 3) Shower pressure. When I checked in I had no water pressure in my shower. I'm not saying that it was too weak. I mean, none. I just took a bath the first morning. After I got back to the hotel in the afternoon and explained the situation, the guy behind the counter told me that there is construction going on and they're going to fix it eventually but there was nothing that he could do. He didn't even attempt to send a maintenance person to look at the problem. This also happened on Day 3 of my stay. On Day 4, the woman at the front desk sent a maintenance person and they changed out the shower head. Problem solved. 4) Not remotely close to anything. If you don't have a rental car, don't bother. The closest restaurant or bar is about a half mile walk. You are also on top of a hill so you have to walk down a long drive just to get to hotel circle. 5) Didn't feel safe. The property only has one person on duty after 1600 or so. There was no screening of guests. Anybody could just walk in and do whatever they wanted and there is no way the hotel staff can do anything about it. I felt like it was just a home invasion waiting to happen. I really just got the feeling that this hotel is the red headed step-child of Wyndham. It's dirty, dingy, old, unprofessional and just a bad place to stay. Pay a little more and get a better room in a better location. I'm spending the rest of my time at the Crowne Plaza across the street. It's not that much more expensive but the difference couldn't be greater. The management in this hotel needs to be fired or start caring about what it is that they do. I felt as though they had no control of anything. When I wanted to talk to the manager on a couple of occasions I was told that he doesn't get to work until 1100 and that he leaves by 1500. Ridiculous. I read other reviews where people are describing the great beds in the rooms. I was not impressed. My bed was an old mattress with a newer pillow topper placed on it. It did not feel good. I didn't sleep very well due to the fact that the first couple nights I was just waiting for the bed bugs to start attacking me in my sleep.

(ramada inn San Diego south) well this time was a different experience entirely! Hawthorn suites is a little difficult to find like other reviewers stated but hotel circle is all hotels so theyre all right next to each other it could get confusing but its not anything to complain about because if you know what you're looking for it shouldn't be a problem. The water pressure was the only thing to complain about, at least in room 216 you're better off taking a bath, plenty of hot water though! Other reviews complained about running out so I was worried but it was endless for me, and my 2 other family members. The toilet flushed weird and the sink drained a little slow. But nothing inconvenient. The room is big! Plenty of room for an entire family. The fold out couch wasn't as uncomfortable as I assumed it'd be and the bed was so comfortable! Great pillows and blanket. Very clean as all, the entire room was cleaned well. Hotel staff is great! So friendly and breakfast was good! It's a buffet. And like with any hotel, get there early to get the best food and variety (that's obvious and shouldn't be complained about, you cannot expect to show up 5 mins before it's over and get what you want) They also have coffee available 24/7 it seems. Laundry is available. No pool, but there is a jacuzzi. Vending machines down stairs, free wifi, flat screen tv, computer downstairs in lobby for use along with printer. Over all good experience, I will stay again, so close to sdsu for anyone coming to visit their children it's a convenient location! Best deal too ( I booked thru priceline bid now option) I save over 20$ a night and they had a stay three night save deal. 80$ a night plus tax of course is what I paid for Thursday-Sunday.

The exterior needs renovation, but the rooms inside are nice. I had a one bedroom suite which far exceeded my expectations and ultimately left me feeling very pleased.

Either their construction and \"sound proofing\" is sub-standard or there were a herd of elephants on the floor above us. It was the worst thundering sound I've ever experienced in a hotel. On the last night I had to take a sleeping pill to block it out. We were so wiped out at the end of every day I just didn't have the energy to complain and move. And we kept hoping the \"elephants\" would check out! The other negative were \"evening snacks\". The fellow at the front desk proudly stated he made the lobster bisque. It wasn't awful-just not good. Beverages consisted of 4 cans of soda. I don't know if people were expected to share or they were only expecting 4 people. (We were there when \"snacks\" began.) I can't comment on the other 2 nights of our stay, as we were out. I turned in the TV remote the first day and they never replaced it. TV quality was poor and the cable selection was pathetic. We paid $79 per night-so the price was good.

I booked through Trip Advisor got a great rate 105 for the 1 bd suite and this room is huge! Flat screen TV in the living room , a regular TV in the bedroom. I was planning on spending quite a bit of time in my room so I wanted a room that had a couch or comfy chair instead of the hard chairs in most hotels. The living room has a couch, three chairs, they weren't LA-Z-Boy recliners but they were comfortable. There was also a small table with two chairs and two more chairs at a little breakfast bar leading to the kitchen. The bed was comfy, better bedding than most comparable hotels. The layout was kind of interesting though. There was a long hallway leading to the living room yet instead of a door leading to the bedroom, the bedroom begins at the end of the hallway, there is no door to the bedroom, it's an open floorplan so you really don't get any privacy. Two couples may want to consider that if one plans on using the sofabed. The bathroom is part of the bedroom so you have to walk through the bedroom to get to it. This hotel is however great, no noise like I've heard in other area hotels, I've only seen a few people during my stay, folks are just in their rooms relaxing, great parking, nice view from the 3rd floor suites (a bigger window would be awesome), great lighting in the room, high 10'ceilings, wonderful hillside full off brush behind the hotel. I saw about 20 hummingbirds congregate for breakfast this morning, amazing, great breakfast (if it's free, it's great in my book). Now the bad.....not much really, just a few minor things. No HBO!!

Really big room with only one AC Unit in the living room, oh well it never gets too hot or cold in Cali! There could be a huge window in the living room.

Apparently not enough time to buy some syrup... Front desk staff told me that management is too greedy to place some WiFi boosters around the hotel, so even at the reception the WiFi signal was 'Very Low' Most of the time we had no WiFi in the room which was a reason to checkout early to go to the Residence Inn next door to do our daily online work. Front desk staff seemed very frustrated by the great number of complaints they got. They was not interested, unpolite and rude.

A huge plus was the free wireless that worked flawlessly, but I got the impression also other hotels in the region offered that. Parking was free, plenty and felt safe. The hotel was nicely situated a bit above the street and the room was thus very quiet.

Their staff is not always the best trained or most sophisticated, but if you approach them in a friendly and respectful manner I think you find that they will reciprocate for the most part. Its obvious they are saving money on staffing, but this did not detract from my stay.

I travel weekly for business and have periodically had this happen to me when I check in to a hotel late at night or during a convention, but none of this applied. One of my colleagues actually did check in and went up to her room to find it terribly dated, dirty and with a bed visibly sagging. She came back down to the lobby, very dissatisfied. I continued to press the desk clerk for a non-smoking room and she voluntarilly said she could put me in a non smoking two room suite. I told her this would be fine. She then disappeared into the back room and came back with a change in the rate from $87 to $159 a night because of the \"room upgrade\". I explained to her that this was unacceptable and I would only pay the rate which I guaranteed to my credit card. She again went in the back and came back with an older man in street clothes who then accused me of making his employee cry. At this point I told him in my 15 years of weekly travel, I have never encountered this. I am a Diamond Level member in Hyatt's Gold Passport program (of which Hawthorn participates). In the end, he was extremely rude and refused to honor the rate or provide a non-smoking room. We then cancelled all three of our reservations and moved to a much nicer property.
