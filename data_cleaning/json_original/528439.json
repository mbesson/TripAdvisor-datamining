The breakfast was perfectly adequate apart from the coffee ! However you can ask for an espresso for no extra charge and that is fine. There is a very good restaurant next door called La Pentolaccia which is very good. Not too expensive, and the waiters are very friendly. It took us about 30-40 minutes to walk to the Trevi from the hotel. we also walked to the Vatican from the Flavia and that took about 50 minutes.

However after seeing a good deal, I booked a city break (11-14 Feb) at the Hotel Flavia. We arrived quite late on the Saturday and were greated a smile, a hello and assistance from the guy on reception. He gave us our key and we headed off. Whilst I agree with some on here, the reception looks quite modern, the hall ways are a little dated and need a little bit of TLC. That in itself didnt bother us much, as were were not planning on spending our time in Rome walking up and down the hotel hallways. Once we entered our room, we were relatively happy with what we saw. We had a double bed (2 singles pushed together), but there was ample storage space for our clothes and the bathroom was large. Again, all a little dated and some things in need of TLC but it suited us as we only used it as a base and a place to get washed and sleep. There was a safe in the wardrobe and this was offered free of charge. Unfortunately we couldnt get ours open and had to speak to reception for help. The guy came up to our room and fixed it for us immediately. The shower was large enough and even though you had to wait a few minutes for the hot water to kick in, it was plenty powerful and did the job. There water is quite soft over there, so just be warned. Our view out of the window wasnt great, but again that didnt bother us as we was not planning on spending time sitting in the hotel. There was a tv which has Italian Sky (HD) available free of charge and also a mini bar. We had 1 can of coke and that cost us \u20ac2. Rome is quite an expensive place anyway, so didnt think that too bad. Breakfast in the morning was plentiful and enough to keep you satisfied until lunch. Everyday on offer you had - bread (for toast and also fresh ciabatta) or on some occasion rolls. There was cheese, ham and boiled eggs. Croissants (plain, chocolate and jam). Cereals, yogurt, fruit and other sweet biscuits. Each of these were replenished when running low, and everything I had tasted fresh. The only thing that was a bit odd, was the coffee pot. It was classed as Americanco coffee. It was a little more like mud in a cup. Some people like that kind of thing, but I dont unfortunately. This didnt stop me however enjoying my breakfast but I believe you can order cappucinos or tea from the lady in the kitchen. The hotel in itself was in an absolutely fantastic spot. Grab a free local map (available in most hotels and restaurants) and use it to get yourself around. The hotel was about 10 mins from the main Termini and only 10-15 mins away from a lot of the attractions such as The Spanish Steps, The Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon. The Colosseum is a bit further but depending on how quick you walk is only about half an hour away. The question is, would I stay at Hotel Flavia again..... Yes, I would.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great experience in Rome!!\u201d", "Author": "bixysophie", "ReviewID": "UR124088278", "Content": "We arrived in Rome very early in the morning and went to our hotel to check in, the receptionist told us that check in time was 2pm ( we knew this ) but we asked if it was possible to get in before, but it wasn't possible.

I know you get what you pay for, and we had 3 nights accommodation at this hotel as part of a really well priced package deal. However I wish now that I'd shelled out just a little bit more and stayed somewhere nicer. This hotel is advertised as 3 stars - i have stayed in 2 star hotels which have been much more pleasant. We stayed in a comparably priced 3 star hotel in Paris last year, which was wonderful. The Foyer looks fairly impressive to walk into, however that's where it ends. Firstly; Our Room. I'm not particularly fussed by the size of a room, and the size of this room was ok. As other reviews have mentioned the only light came from 2 bedside lamps (one with a broken shade that had ripped and torn off) and the light in the bathroom. The bed was uncomfortable, had no duvet, just a sheet & quilt, (i know this is often the case in some continental hotels - but just incase you were expecting a duvet), we had one pillow each which I would generously describe as WAFER THIN. The room was clean-ish, but there was lots of scuffing on the walls etc. The bathroom was adequate - apart from the shower, which you couldn't really describe as a shower....more like a hose protruding from the wall, with ill fitting shower doors and bad drainage. In the room there was a safe (good) and a minibar, but NO information whatsoever about the hotel, the prices for the minibar, fire exits, local attractions...infact no information AT ALL. Plus side, a good TV with plenty of channels. Some reviews have commented that if you just want somewhere to sleep at night, this place is fine. I'm unsure if I agree - cos really that's all I was after, and I'm not particularly fussy. But I was unable to sleep at night due to the discomfort of the bed and the NOISINESS of other guests, running down corridors, shouting....I know that's not the hotel's fault, but really the walls were so thin I thought there were people IN the room. Breakfast was also poor. To get to the breakfast room you had to walk outside through a really grotty courtyard full of odd shaped concrete. I love food, I love eating and I love continental style breakfasts, But everything about this spread was just not very nice. The coffee was awful, you had to wait for an attenant to serve you any other drink - and there wasn't always anyone there. The 'juice' tasted of weak squash. The pastries looked good, but proved inedible. The boiled eggs were ok. On day 2 we decided to just skip it and eat out somewhere. On the plus side, they had european MTV playing (bizarrely) and we saw some rather entertaining Italian rap videos! BUT...the thing that gets my goat the most, and the reason i've written this review and not just kept it to myself, is the absolutely awful level of customer service we received. Despite all of the above, I would be entirely forgiving if the PEOPLE had made us feel at all welcome, or had hinted at even having a speck of friendliness about them. Instead we were greeted at reception by one word grunts, no eye contact, no helpful information. I'm astonished that other reviews described the staff as friendly. I've never met more unfriendly people, and it rather gives the impression that they know they don't have to try because it's Rome, and they'll always have customers. I feel that on a city break like Rome, its so important to have somewhere comfortable and relaxing to return to at the end of the day.

We selected this hotel after reviewing it in Tripadvisor but did not select it because of its rating - we simply didn't have any other options in such short notice. This is not a hotel for couples looking for a romantic break, it is an average base and nothing more. Pros: Location - 10 minutes walk from Termini or a short bus ride and also a bus ride from everything else in central Rome. surroundings feel much safer than near Termini with some nice restaurants around. Service - receptionists were very kind and helped us with recommendations of what to see and where to eat. Cons: Price - for such a level of hotel the price was over the top (perhaps because we ordered on the day of arrival). Room - very small, don't go there if you plan to stay in the room for a considerable amount of time. WiFi - in the room with charge, but was quite cheap. Cleanliness - room was clean and tidy, but the halls were quite dirty in our floor (2nd). Decor - feels a bit rustic and old, requires a refresh. Toilets and shower - this was strange, the toilet was in a cubicle where the shower is supposed to go and the shower itself is exposed, a second person cannot enter the toilet during a shower. In addition, it was an electronic flush toilet and it made a lot of noise. Bottom line: Go there only if you need to spend a night before your flight and other higher rated hotels are occupied.

The Hotel Flavia is about a 12 minute walk from the train station (if you know where you are going). It takes about 20 minutes to walk to the Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, etc. and about 25 minutes to the Colosseum. We even walked to the Vatican (I read alot of bad things about Rome's public transportation) and that took us about 45 minutes at a comfortable stroll (stopping in souvenior shops along the way). If you don't mind walking and enjoy following a map, the location is great (except for a bit of an uphill slope on the way back - take your time!) The room was very clean. Nice spacious bathroom and a good shower. The 'double' bed was two singles pushed together but it's like that everywhere in Europe and it doesn't really bother us. There was a small tv with a few channels and even a fridge that we used to store some drinks and cheese. I couldn't tell you about the breakfast - we never wake up in time for that - we are on vacation after all! The Ministry of Defense is right down the road, so pay no attention to the guards with big guns. We also recommend you ask reception to hold onto your room key - we dubbed it 'the anchor' and my husband got a bruise on his thigh from it!

It is close to the Termini train station - ~15 minutes by foot \u2013 with wheeled luggage and fair weather you do not need a taxi to get there in order to proceed to Fumicino airport (Leonardo Express train). Nearest Metro station \u2013 Republica - ~10 minutes walk. Exploring Rome by foot \u2013 the Flavia is on the North-East perimeter of the tourist attraction area. You can definitely walk to all the tourist attractions \u2013 but it is too far away to return after several hours on foot for a short (or longer) rest fthe legs to start exploring again, especially not from the Tiber river area or beyond (Vatican). Rooms and accommodations: The hotel seems to be brand new/renovated recently, although the clerk told us that the renovation took place several years ago, so probably the maintenance is excellent.

Picking hotels from a website is a complete nightmare - but i fell on my feet with the Hotel Flavia at venere.com. It was a little pricier than i wanted, 100 Euros a night for a single, but it had everything i could have wanted. I do a lot of business trips in England so i am probably a little spoilt, but i had no complaints at all about the hotel. The room was basic, but clean and modern. The bed was comfortable and there was hot water whenever i needed it. The towels were clean and the room was cleaned daily and towels changed regularly. I was there for 4 days. The location is fantastic. It's 10 minutes walk from the main station, which was where the Terrorvision coach dropped me. If your travelling from Ciampino airport, i thoroughly recommend them - check out their website - 13.50 Euros got me a return trip from Ciampino to the main station terminal, their ticket office is just ahead and to the right at Ciampino. The coaches are air conditioned, which is a godsend in hot weather. Anyway, the location of Hotel Flavia is excellent. It's about 15 minutes walk to the Spanish steps and within walking distance, for those inclined, of all the major attractions. In two days, my friend and I visited the Spanish steps, Trevi Fountain, Coloseum, Palatine Hill, St Peters, Castell D'Angelo, Pantheon, Circo Maximus, a walk down the banks of the Tiber and a number of other places all by foot. If your English speaking and you do visit the Coloseum, seek out Discovery Tours by the entrance. For 20 Euros, they'll bypass the sometimes lengthy queues and give you a guided hour long tour of the Coloseum and then another 45 mins at the Palatine Hill where the Emperors lived. I guarantee it's well worth it - you learn so much more about these places than you would if you just walked around. It's not too rushed so you get time for plenty of photos and there is a short break in between. Anyway, back to the hotel. They didn't try and change anything or charge me more. They certainly knew their English well. The breakfasts were not limited and there was plenty to eat if you wanted, they didn't run out of anything. I had seen many horror stories of other hotels on the internet. There is a lift that reaches the upper floors and a telephone in each room, with the exception of 222 for some reason. Also, for those that need to remain in touch, there are lots of little phone and internet cafe's around Rome. Lastly, we also found a great restaurant on my first night, the Ristorante La Locanda di Bacco. It's not the restaurant next door to the Flavia but a few doors down at number 32, just on the other side of a little shop (from which i recommend the strawberries - bliss!). . They served beautiful meals at a sensible price. Beware, Italians seem to spend all night eating so their portions can only be described as 'healthy\". The owner is called Roberto and is a really friendly person. I returned a few times, both to eat and just for coffee and a pastry. I was always treated with courtesy and respect and never overcharged. Please mention you saw his restaurant recommended on the internet.
