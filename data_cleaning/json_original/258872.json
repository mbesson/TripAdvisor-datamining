Ours had a view of the square and the canal, from which we could see Venice working as boats plied the canal delivering and picking up goods, rubbish, furniture etc etc, ie we saw how the city works. There were two layers of windows plus the outside shutters plus curtains. We were there in January when it was quite cold outside but v.warm inside. The girls room had a view across a narrow passageway into the building next door! We have seen rooms like this many times though, so concentrate on what you get inside the room and the hotel as in Europe at this price point you do well to get a view. The bathrooms were well appointed, the beds comfortable. Buffet Breakfast was sufficient and great table service if you wanted a coffee.

The only thing I had a hard time with was finding it when arriving from the airport. We were told to get off at the Rialto stop (we were arriving on Alilaguna) but it seems that the walk from the San Toma stop would have been far simpler. A map with directions on how to walk there would be an extremely helpful tool for the hotel to provide before arrival, either via email or on their website. The apartment itself was around the corner from the hotel down a narrow passageway. It was spacious, modern, clean and comfortable with 2 bedrooms and bathrooms, a kitchen and living room. The canal view is very limited but really unimportant to the stay. We had breakfast one morning consisting of croissants, bread, cereals, yogurts, juices and coffee selections.

It was about a 10 to 15-minute walk to the Grand Canal in any direction. Our room and adjoining bathroom were very pleasant, clean, plenty big enough for we two and had triple glazing and air-conditioning. The entrance is up a flight of stairs so I am not sure if disabled people can be catered for? A perfectly adequate continental breakfast is served in the hotel reception area, off which its small number of rooms radiate. The very busy lady who serves the guests could appear brusque if you chose to take her the wrong way, but with a little attempt at poor Italian and many smiles on your part she soon reveals her warmth and sense of humour. This is not a hotel with any other facilities, ie a pool or spa, but on a short break to Venice, who wants to sit in the hotel? The gentleman on reception when we arrived gave us almost too much information about the map of Venice and places to visit but it all proved invaluable as the days unfolded. As with many hotels, the staff have their 'preferred' places to advise you to try but you don't have to take their advice and we found the restaurant just below the hotel to be a good place to eat authentic Italian food. We also liked Nono's Ristora very much and found some good places en route to other places. A good rule of thumb seems to be to avoid any restaurant where the staff wait outside to entice you in. I had the worst 8 euro bowl of vegetable 'soup' in one such place near the Academia bridge. The area in which this hotel is situated has one or two local bars which are most welcoming if you take the trouble to go in.

The breakfast was basic but good enough to start the day. We were also pleased with the hospitality and service provided by the Italian breakfast lady. If you stay there, you MUST try the Pizzeria Due Colonne located just next to Loconda Sant Agostin. This restaurant is just a gem and popular amongst the locals. The food is delicious and good value for money. We ordered the tourist menu and it is euro 15 for 2 main courses (spagetti, calamari) and a mixed salad, euro 12 for 2 main courses (tortellini, pork cutlet with fries). Absolutely a find and the highlight of our Venice trip. Go before 8pm if not it will be packed by then.

It is a little difficult to find, but if you are worried about getting lost, you should probably just not go to Venice, since the city itself is a giant labyrinth. Also, the fact that the hotel is a bit hard to find is what makes it worthwhile, since it is hidden from the hordes of tourists plaguing the rest of Venice. We ended up spending a lot of time just hanging out in the area of the hotel, since it was so uncrowded, and really had a lot of local life going on. The room itself (the double Superior pictured in the \"Rooms\" section of their website) was very simple and clean, but with beautiful furnishings including Murano glass chandelier. The best thing about the room was definitely the fill window with balcony and gorgeous view of the quiet pizza and canal below. We spent a lot of time just sitting and admiring the view. We ate 2 nights at and highly recommend the restaurant right downstairs from the hotel (Pizzeria Due Collonne, I believe) as it was incredibly inexpensive, with delicious pizza, pasta, big salads, and great house wine. There were a lot of locals at this restaurant too, including a huge party of Venetians one night, so you know it is a hidden gem. :) We didn't have the breakfast any morning, so can't comment on it, because service ended at 9:30am, which was a little early for us, jet-lagged and all. Also, it was a little annoying that the internet did not reach all the way into the room (sitting by the door it works), but those are really our only complaints. The service was very good - we were greeted every time we walked through the lobby, and all the desk staff were very helpful and willing to take lots of time to answer our questions.

The hotel advertises itself as being \"in the geographical centre of Venice\" and I wouldn't be surprised if that was actually true - pretty much everything is an equal distance and not very far at all. The Rialto bridge is about 15 minutes' walk and Piazza San Marco is around 25 minutes away, though the nearest vaporetto stop (San Toma) is about 7 minutes' walk so it is easier to get to San Marco by water. Also a few minutes' walk away are the big, busy squares of Campo San Polo and Campo dei Frari which are good for food and sightseeing, but far enough away that the hotel is quiet and secluded. The hotel itself is located just off a small, quiet campo (square) and as a result feels very charming and real - nothing like the big touristy palazzi on the Grand Canal! It is furnished in typical lavish Venetian style but isn't over the top at all. Our room wasn't small (which is unusual for Venice) and was very comfortable. The beds in particular were excellent! The staff were always helpful and the breakfasts, while fairly basic, were good quality. The WiFi worked perfectly from our room, which was at the end of the corridor. We also had breakfast in bed one morning and it was very well done - I would highly recommend asking for this at least once! All in all, the Locanda Sant'Agostin is a perfect place to explore Venice - it is only a short walk to many of the main sights and is close to a vaporetto stop for everything else. It was also very reasonably-priced for Venice as we booked early online using a Tripadvisor Special Offer (which expires in December 2011) and paid in cash. If you are looking for a hotel in Venice which is centrally-located but not too busy, comfortable, high-quality and reasonably-priced, the Locanda Sant'Agostin is ideal. p.s.

The room was big, but a bit drab. A TV the size of a toaster, not a big deal, but at this price? Give me a nice TV. I have a brick wall to look at outside my window! Well, at least breakfast is included. Hmm, another dissapointment. So you're telling me that for $250 a night, all you can give me is some cornflakes, a croissant, and some juice? It was rediculous. Upon reading some of the other elated reviews, I read about the rooms with the fantastic views of the nearby canal and plaza. I felt majorly ripped off. I won't go back. This place has VERY LITTLE charm. The room I was put in should not be a room they put guests in. If you decide to go, make sure you don't have this room. To top it off, if you don't stay more than 3 nights, you have to pay in cash. That's BS. And the lady who speaks no english... she's nice and all, but stop blabbering to me like I understand.

Not so in our case. It was conducted with very little communication by a receptionist who looked like the job was beneath him. Our room was extremely small and with no view. Decor was pleasing though. The room was next to the reception desk, which was just as well as there was no offer to help with our cases.

We took a water taxi to a stop and from then on it was 5-10 minute walk navigating the lane ways. A map is definitely necessary. We booked the apart hotel (it is actually about 100m away down the road in a different place from the hotel - so may not be convenient to walk back for breakfast), I suspect they double booked us so we stayed in a suite instead. The suites are pretty good, they contain a double bed with ensuite. Only complaint is that the hotel has no internet (apparently there is a place with internet 5 minutes away) and the only English channel, BBC, had no sound! Otherwise, the room was good value for Venice and I would recommend it.", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat place - good value - will stay again\u201d", "Author": "WanderingAngusEurope", "ReviewID": "UR66202286", "Content": "Spent 3 days in Venice at Locanda Sant Agostin which was recommended by a friend.

If you arrive by bus from the airport, you don't need a water taxi to get there. In the area there are not too many tourist either which means 30-40 percent lower prices than those you will find in restaurants close to Saint Marco. It takes only 15 minutes to walk to San Marco and 7-8 minutes to get to the Rialto bridge. I could also recommend a Vapareto (water bus) ticket to get to the sights in Venice. It will take some time to travel by those, but then can see the city also from the canals. The ticket is not very cheap, but much less expensive than water taxi or gondola and the view is the same or better. By that you visit also other islands like Murano or others. Hotel itself is small and comfortable with an exellent service. You feel there like at home. The staff is able to speak good English and they can give you good recommendations where to go or eat. Rooms are not big, but big enough for spending your few night hours there. The quality of your sleep is also exellent because rooms are very quiet. The variety of breakfast choices is not very wide, but comparing to local standards it is wide. The breakfast room doesn't offer a table for everyone at the same time, if the hotel is fully occupied, but you do not have to wait too long either to find a free seat.

I used the trip advisor reviews as a guide, and I'm glad I did. Brief version: The staff made us feel very welcome and provided lots of recommendations for restaurants and areas to visit. The hotel was clean and elegant with pretty, Venetian style rooms of reasonable size (for Venice). Breakfast was basic continental (croissants, bread rolls, yogurt, cereal and drinks). The location is superb, away from the crowds but close enough to walk to everywhere easily. We found the area and its alleyways more charming than some of the grander sights in Venice! TIP: if you pay in cash you get a significant discount as they prefer to avoid charges (this is similar for many Venetian hotels). More detail: we stayed in room 103/B which is a double room with a small balcony overlooking the square and canal - an enchanting first experience. The room had a wardrobe but no drawers or shelves, so we kept our underwear in our suitcases. On our third day we were moved to a suite (they'd double-booked us). We didn't mind as it was a lovely suite and they didn't charge us extra. This was room 102 (I think) and was large with drawers and shelving. This is a large double room or a room for four at a squeeze. This didn't have a balcony but two windows looking into the alleyway. We met Dario, Manuel and another guy (but we didn't get his name) on reception and each had their own recommendations for Venice. We are glad to have taken up their restaurant recommendations by and large. But we ignored one recommendation not to go to the Castello gardens area (a shabbier but very charming area to the east of St Marks). I don't think our advisor thought it was awful but possibly assumed we only wanted to see the grander sights. We are really glad we wandered to this area, however. We aren't the type of tourists who zone in on the glamorous sights only, and the peaceful walk through the gardens to the imposing Arsenal was a delight on a sunny day. The lady who serves breakfast divided opinion. She is clearly very friendly and encourages you to try out the language, speaking to every guest. It gave me the opportunity to speak Italian (she doesn't seem to speak English, whereas the people on reception do). My partner, however, found it intimidating when she persisted in talking to him in a language he doesn't understand. If you are not a fan of trying out the language, or being chatted to at breakfast - have your breakfast in your room, which is an option. If you don't mind the opportunity to chat to a friendly Italian woman (no matter how bad your Italian is) then here is your chance! Breakfast would have been improved with some fresh fruit and a wider variety of cereals but it was adequate to start us off. The double windows are excellent at shutting out most noise (but this isn't a very noisy area anyway). However, there is a pub underneath one side. This had some sort of event on during our first night and we could hear a vague voice on a microphone. It didn't disturb us as we walked so much that we fell asleep straightaway - and we didn't hear it on subsequent nights, but if you are a light sleeper then you may ask for a room away from this pub. Overall, this is a lovely little hotel and better than many others at such a price.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel, central location\u201d", "Author": "Euro1999", "ReviewID": "UR63506008", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at Laconda Sant'Agostin for 3 nights at the end of April.

Delicious coffee made to order. All the staff at the front desk were very helpful and accommodating.

Some restaurants only accept cash also. A useful tip to remember is that each building has a unique number, this hotel is something like 2305, so it is easier to find the hotel by following house numbers rather than looking up street names. For Gondola trips I think the last night trips head out at about 9 o'clock. Burano island is well worth the trip and St Marks Square is fabulous.

The two problems we had were a) it was very hot on July 17 and the air conditioing unit - one small one for the entire apartment was not sufficient to really cool down the apartment fully. b) We over packed and found that in Venice you have to carry your bags - no way to economically get to the hotel except by walking - carrying the bags over 4 little bridges really tired my wife and I out. So, in conclusion the Locanda is a very nice hotel, just don't bring many heavy bags and hopefully you won't get a very hot day (the other days were fine) One last point the staff is very helpful, giving great suggestions.

In reality, it is ten minutes walk from the station as opposed to our half hour getting lost three times.. You could try a water taxi however they are very expensive and the vaporetto only travels the main waterways. Anyway, none of these issues are the hotels fault. The Locanda Sant' Agostin is a lovely hotel with some of the most courteous staff i have found on my travels. The rooms are very tastefully decorated and everyone seemed dedicated to making our stay an enjoyable one. The hotel is a little away from the main tourist haunts such as St Marks however once you find your way around (which happens very quickly) you reaise you are only ten minutes from the rialto bridge. You also have the advantage of being in a place wgere you can explore a little and find new squares and restaurants.

I happened to have my b-day one of the days I was there. She found out (I guess my wife had something to do with it, although she wouldn't admit) but the point is, Eugenia brought to our room a nice breakfast with cute arrangements and 2 bullinis to celebrate. She didn't have to do that, a happy b-day would 've been enough... It's just that kind of place... 2. Location: Away from major touristic paths, it is literally 15 min away from Piazza San Marco and 10 min from Rialto. You feel you are one of the locals, the stores and restaurants nearby are mainly frequented by Venetians and not by many tourists. To me this was great. I felt I could experience the true life of Venetians while at the same time I was just a few min away from the major touristic areas. We loved it... 3. Comfort: The room we stayed in had a nice view of a small venetian cannal (I have posted a few pics). The room is adequate, slightly small but very comfortable. After all I did not go to Venice to spend my time in a hotel room. Having said that the bed was nice and comfortable (queen size). There is climate control, a small tv and a comfortable bathroom with a nice shower. I read other reviews and comments regarding noise but to be honest my room was extremely quiet to a point that I thought we were the only guests in the hotel. What a surprise when I found out that it was actually packed... we didn't hear a single 'peep'. Not even from the busy street and cannal underneath us... 4. Food: The hotel does not have a restaurant although there is a great place next door. It's a small pizzeria, but by far one of the best in town (according to some locals)... We ate there once, it was very very good... Now if you are looking for a fancy dinner, Venice has plenty of places to try. I WOULD NOT recommend a place suggested by the staff called Vivaldi... it was TERRIBLE, again, I am honest, the place was dirty (flies all over) and despite being the ONLY clients there, we had terribloe service and the food sucked!, too bad we had to pay close to 60 euros for a terrible experience... In summary I have to say Locanda Sant Agostin is a great place to stay. I would definetely come back. The service was outstanding and the price is just right. Thank you Eugenia, you are great...", "Date": "April 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin,Ireland", "Title": "\u201cCharming hotel and great value\u201d", "Author": "L8Dublin", "ReviewID": "UR27939095", "Content": "Locanda San Agostin is the most charming hotel; it is all about service and making sure the guests are comfortable.

Sorry to say it was DISAPPOINTING. Firstly, this place is NOT A HOTEL. Laconda means Inn in Italian, and this is more B&B than an inn. No facilities to speak of, you eat 'breakfast' in the reception area, the ROOMS (we had a 'superior') are EXTREMELY SMALL as are the bathrooms. The photographs on the website are misleading. Our room had a balcony 'with a canal view'. On the website it looks as if two people could sit comfortably on it. It was tiny, no way you could fit a table and chair (as per website) and the canal was off to the right. All credit to the photograher, he worked miracles with a fish-eye lense and creative angles!! We did not get to the hotel until around 9.30. Restaurants in Venice tend to close at 10.00pm & we had enquired as to a good local restaurant that would suffice the first night. Emanuele at reception had given us the name of a local pizzeria / pasta restaurant by email & said that it was very close. When we checked in the woman at reception, who also served the extremely limited 'breakfast', refused point blank to direct us to the restaurant. We had been travelling all day, were very tired and hungry and simply wanted to eat and have a glass of wine. Shouldn't be that difficult? She babbled at us in Italian and sent us on a wild goose chase to some place she said was \"better for tourists.\" Luckily we gave up as it was getting close to 10.00 & found our way back to the hotel. There was a small local restaurant right next door, not the right one admittedly, but it did us fine. Breakfast is only served for 1 hour 15 mins and is a dreadful affair. If you like small croissants, packets of industrial jam, and coffee from a machine then this is for you. Again the reality is that this place should not refer to itself as a hotel. The woman from the previous evening serves the coffee and (just what you need first thing in the morning) delights in humiliating, shouting and laughing at non-fluent Italian speakers. It gets really, really wearing after day one. She thinks she's hilarious. There is nowhere to sit and relax, no facilities, no atmosphere. To be fair Emanuele on reception is a helpful guy. Having said that we said we were not happy and nothing was done. Something else you really need to be aware of, THEY WANT PAYMENT IN CASH. Draw your own conclusions about that one. They say they'll do a special deal if you'll pay this way. The limit for cash withdrawals in Italy is 250 euros per day. We don't travel with lots of cash, who does these days? When I went to pay the bill by credit card as previously agreed the other guy on reception really was not happy. We asked to see a standard room as well as we wanted to compare, but he simply showed us another room exactly the same as the one we had. His answer was \"all hotel rooms in Venice are small\". Not only are the rooms in this place tiny, but the one we had was simply half of what had been a bigger room that had been partitioned off with plasterboard. We could hear everything, toilets etc, next door and from the room above. A very poor standard and not what we expected nor paid for. This place would be ok if it did not try to pass itself off as something it isn't. Something else too, they give a feedback form and if you were satisfied with your stay they email you to ask for a favourable Trip Advisor review. We found the hotel through Trip Advisor and will never book a hotel on that basis again. Anyone can put up a review. Basically we said on day one we were not happy, nothing was done. We said on day two we still were not happy, nothing was done. When we checked out we said it again, and when we got home we emailed them and yes, you've guessed it - nothing was done. Do yourself and your partner a favour, Venice is full of great hotels. Don't be fooled by the tiny amount you are saving by staying here. BOOK A REAL HOTEL INSTEAD, YOU WON'T REGRET IT. I've checked prices and you can get a 4 or 5 Star Hotel close to the Campo di San Marco or Rialto Bridge for the same or less with all the facilities you would expect. The reviews on Trip Advisor and the 'hotel' website just don't stack up.

We just spent a week in Italy (2 nights each Rome, Florence, Venice), followed by a week in Paris, France. Venice was BY FAR our favorite city, and our choice of hotel had a lot to do with that. The staff was very kind and accommodating, our room was gorgeous, and much bigger than any of the rooms we stayed at in the other cities (and not any more expensive). I can not speak about the room temperature as the general climate was cool and rainy while we were there, so we had absolutely no complaints. But I will say that we got the impression that the staff would help us in whatever way they could if we only asked. We had room 103B and it was beautifully appointed, with a large comfortable bed, lovely Murano glass chandelier, a more than adequate bathroom (not fancy but certainly clean and modern) and a balcony that opened onto a small square and canal. If there were one thing I would change, and I find this rather minor, I would wish for more variety in the breakfast choices, or for the option to have the cost of breakfast deducted if we choose not to eat there. There is so much delicious food in Venice, I hated to waste a meal on mediocre choices for breakfast. Make no mistake, the food is fresh and plentiful...but not too exciting. That would be my only mildly negative comment and it will NOT keep us away in the future. The neighborhood is charming, quiet and out of the way of the real bustle over by St. Marks Square, and the hotel is very easy to find. We walked ALL OVER Venice and didn't see another location we would have preferred to stay in more, although the island itself is amazing and we can't wait to visit again, for a longer period. My husband and I both agree that when we do return, we will stay at the Locanda if at all possible.

From the moment we walked into the breakfast area we were aware we had to get out as they wanted to finish service. The waitress asked us if we wanted a second coffee and then said we had to take it to our rooms as she wanted to clean up.

Other places which we visited included the lido (beach) which is a boat ride to the end of the canal, there is not much to do when you get there but we hired a bike and had a nosey around and enjoyed a pizza in one of the local restaurants. By night the Rialto bridge is a must, very romantic, we enjoyed dinner here on all nights of our stay which was very nice, note restaurants will charge a premium for the location but it does make your experience to venice awesome. We also enjoyed a ride on the very famous Gondala, there are many people trying to offer you a trip on thier Gondala but wait until you get a price thats right for you, we bartered for a half hour - 40 min boat ride for \u00c2\u00a380 euros which seemed about the going rate for this length of time. There our lots of museams around to visit, we visited Doges Palace which is recommended, lots of artwork and a prison where you can visit the bridge of sighs. All in all, Venice is a must european city break with lots to do and see, very romantic and ideal for couples. The hotel is situated in a great location more or less central to everything and around 10-15 min walk to the Rialto Bridge.

We are glad that we did. We deated the merit of staying on Lido and away from Venice proper but it just didn't make much sense for us. We are four people, with a 3.5 yo and 16yo, and so we needed a larger room. The room here was spacious and clean. It accommodated us easily. Breakfast in the morning was served with a smile with cereal, expresso or coffee and crossiants and jam. It was a good start to the day. The location was ideal for getting around to see the sites and the suggestions were decent on places to go. We found Venice a little touristy and the selection fo food in restaurants was pretty standard pizza and pastas. Sadly they were not as good as other areas of our trip. Venice is a city to walk in, and there was plenty to see. We enjoyed the waterbus around the city and the Grand Canal as well as Piazza San Marco. We had a day trip to Murano on a one-way water taxi to the factory and even though we bought, it mustn't have been enough and we were shown the water bus entrance for the return trip. I would recommend this hotel and the friendly, helpful staff. This for 4 people was not cheap, but then again nothing in Venice will be in July. Incidentally, buy a detailed map for walking around as Venice is a maze of narrow streets and bridges.

Venice, as we now realise, can be unbearably hot & humid, & it was - well over 30c each day. Thankfully the hotel has superb airconditioning, effective & QUIET. We had the famous 'room with a view' over the neighbouring canal but, since the outside temp was so high, opening the windows out onto the small balcony wasn't really an option. Noise-wise the double (triple?) glazed windows are super efficient & keep out all of the passing street/ canal sounds below - which aren't much anyway as the hotel is situated in a quiet friendly area, much less touristy than expected, with a distinct local flavour. The best thing by far about the hotel is the staff, especially the brothers Federico & Leonardo who go out of their way to make you feel welcome, & supply as much excellent information about sights, restaurants, travel as you could possibly need. All the other staff were extremely friendly & helpful too. My one niggle (which makes me hesitate to give the hotel 5 stars) is about breakfast, which is passable by european buffet standards and the lady serving is always there to top up your coffee, but overall it's unimaginative eg no fresh fruit, no choice of cereals or pastries. There are excellent coffee bars & pastry shops in the vicinity but breakfast is included in the room prices so it's a pity it's not up to the general standard of the hotel. Room service isn't offered & I don't think you need it in such a compact set-up, with the desk manned night & day. But it would have been great to have been able to make a cup of tea or coffee outside breakfast hours. I think a 24 hr tea/ coffee machine would be a real asset. The supplied directions from vaporetto stop 'San Stae' were really easy to follow & it takes less than 10' to walk to the hotel. After afternoons amongst the huge crowds in & around San Marco, The Rialto, Accademia etc, it was always a real pleasure to return to the quiet area around the hotel.

Unfortunately, when we arrived, that room appeared to have been taken, notwithstanding their confirmation by e-mail. However, our initial slight irritation quickly dissolved when we were offered the appartment for the same price. The appartment (2 rooms, 2 bathrooms, sitting room with TV, kitchen with huge fridge) is right around the corner from the hotel in a tiny alley, next to a canal. It was absolutely spotlessly clean! Good airco (which we needed, since it was over 30\u00c2\u00b0 Celsius). After our initial misgivings of being in an appartment rather than a hotel room, we truly enjoyed our stay. The only down side was that no one came in to make our bed or change towels during our 3 days' stay but, judging from the personnel's friendliness, I'm sure they would have, had we asked for it. As it was, we didn't really bother and just enjoyed the lovely city of Venice to the max ! We had to go to the hotel for breakfast but didn't mind that. Breakfast is served in a nice room and good for Italian standards but rather poor to our liking, except for the coffee. But there's a wonderful bakery next doors AND a great coffeeshop on the corner. Location cannot be beat if you like a quiet area which is nevertheless close enough to all the main places of interest and to lots of places to eat. Everything is within a 15-30 minutes' walk. We even walked to Canareggio (lovely, quiet walk, almost no tourists). We had a lovely meal at Vivaldi's (recommended by Leonardo). We cannot comment on the hotel rooms since we did not see them. Anyway, I guess most rooms do not have any view to speak of but if that's what you're looking for, you'll have to be prepaired to pay much more and after all, who wants to be inside a hotel room when there's so much to do and see in Venice?

Many of the supposedly more popular hotels are located right next to the bus station, which means a long walk or a waterbus into the centre for sightseeing.

I got a big reduction for paying cash. The hotel recommended Birraria restaurant (their no.1) was definitely the best and cheapest. Within 20 yards of the hotel is an ice cream parlour, a bar, a pizza restaurant, a fast-food pizza place, etc, and two small squares as well as a canal.

There is a very steep flight of stairs up to the reception where all the rooms are located on this single level. This is venice though and is to be expected, at least the rooms are all on the same level. So don't pack alot unless you have a strong (and willing!) man. You should also note that you are not allowed to eat or drink in the hotel rooms, and you have to hand in you key before you leave, and retrive when you get back which alot of hotels do apparently for security reasons. The room was beautiful and just like the photos on the website, but do not expect any water views. Our two windows opened out onto a brick wall, and courtyard type area. However the room was furnished beautifully and very well maintained and extremely clean. My daughter felt like a princess and adored the bedhead and chandlier which sure wanted to take home! The tv is very small though and only italian channels. The hair dryer in our room didn't work. The bathroom was beauitful though with marble tiling etc. It had shower/bath, toilet, bidet, and corner basin. Be warned though if you are expecting to use wireless internet, forget it - there is a firewall on the modem, which when asked the staff about after paying 5 euros for unlimited use they said they couldn't do anything, so you cannot access emails, myspace, blogs, etc. etc. The location was good, a little bit of a find but that is the maze of Venice! You can take a private water taxi, at stupid prices of 60 euro etc. upwards, straight to doorstep but otherwise you need to depart the water bus at S.Toma station and take you bags over bridges and navigate you way through narrow streets. This is everywhere though in Venice unless you are prepared to pay 4 or 5 star hotel prices. You should be fine, buy a map before boarding the water bus, and ask wherever possible for some help with directions. Most venetians are used to confused tourists asking for help with navigation! I would advise however not to arrive in Venice at night unless you know it like the back of your hand or are prepared to pay at least 80 euro for private water taxi. The staff were mostly helpful depending on who was on front desk.. The man who was on 2 april in the morning was extremely helpful and we would like to thank him for a great stay. You may find many venetians very arrogant toward english speaking tourists, which is bizarre considering Venice is powered entirely by tourism by anyway, but he was one of the least arrogant people we came across and very helpful and friendly. It makes the difference really. The breakfast was reasonable if small because there are only a few rooms in the hotel, and typical italian. Coffee, hot chocolate, breads, croissants, cornflakes, yoghurt, juice etc.. Overall, Locanda is great value, the room will satisfy the most fussy, even without water views, the location is good and very quiet. The staff were mostly helpful and friendly.

This was two months before....the cynic in me suggests that they perhaps had a better offer from someone else.....nevertheless, we like small hotels so looked for an alternative and came across this. If this is no 15 in the popularity rank of Venice hotels then that doesn't say much for the rest. Now I know the Orseola is no 1 but this is very average! Let's start with the good parts - well it is in a very pleasant location, with easy access from bus and train, and with some of the very best Venice sights close by - the neighbourhood is residential with many good restaurants and shops round about, and generally away from the crowds! The hotel is immaculately clean and the reception is pleasant and helpful. The rooms - well don't bother paying extra for the one's at the front if you want a good nights sleep! Hot! Hot! Hot! We complained each day to the \"reception\" - who told us that they were not \"authorised\" to turn on the air conditioning and the reason it is hot is that Venice is humid! The quadruple double glazing and shutters do a great job of keeping the noise out and the hot air in. Open the windows and shutters to get the temperature down, and you hear people walking by all night and much though I like them, the Italians are not quiet. So much for the \"individual room air conditioning unit\" in the hotel description. ( and whatever the management say about this it was raised with them each day!!!) The rooms themselves are smallish but I guess it is Venice, and the bathrooms also small but with a great shower! Beds ok if firm - limited other furniture, Breakfast - very basic at this price range and the lady who serves the coffee is not that pleasant at all , and makes little attempt to communciate beyond her mantra of coffee offers.....that she sings out regularly! Service is OK - but they really don't attempt to do more than they have to, no extra mile ....( eg tea/ coffeee in the rooms, internet, pleasant sitting area) . So compared to the Orseola - I am afraid this loses hands down. If you like small hotels and can get a reservation at the Locanda Orseola don't give this a second thought!

It was a bit tricky to find, as the directions I received from Federico (one of the owners) stopped at a critical point. He forgot to tell us that after you turn left at San Baldo/Calle del Calice and reach the Campo Sant'Agostin, you then need to TURN RIGHT and continue until you see the sign for Locanda Sant'Agostin appear on the left (immediately past a pizzaria that had tables outside in the Campo). Without that last instruction we ended up dragging our suitcases out of our way to Campo San Polo. There I found a real estate office and she directed me back the way we came, and from there found a jewelry store owner who took us outside of his store and pointed us to the hotel. Everyone we met in Venice was VERY VERY warm and helpful. Once we made it to the hotel and up the steep flight of stairs to the lobby, all was well and we were warmly welcomed and shown our room. It was not on a canal, but this was not important to us, since we did not spend much time there. It was roomy with good closet space and an in-room safe. Bathroom was nice, although hair dryer was a bit odd (had to hold it at just the correct angle to get it to operate) and the shower doors leaked, so there would be a pool of water under the sink after we showered. We told the owner and he seemed unconcerned about this (maybe when you live in Venice, a little water on the bathroom floor is nothing to worry about! :-) What was especially great was the heated towel rack, handy for hanging hand washed clothes and getting them to dry overnight. Breakfasts were very pleasant with charming, friendly service and good coffee. The location was excellent, particularly if you prefer to say away from the San Marco/Rialto Bridge crowds. The neighborhood had lots of great restaurants, artsy shops, was central to everything, and close enough to San Stae stop that you could hop on a vaperetto if you were tired of map reading. A piece of advice our hotel gave us was to buy the 72 hour boat pass, so that we could just hop on and off as often as we pleased (which came in VERY handy one day when we took the ferry to Burano, and then made mistakes and jumped on and off several wrong ferries, before finally getting on the right ferry to Torcello!). It cost us $25 euros each, but paid for itself by the end of our stay. One other sweet thing, my friend turned 50 during out stay, and the staff left her a birthday note with softdrinks in our room.

For our recent visit to Venice we thought the Locanda Sant'Agostin would suit our requirements perfectly. We arrived at about 9.30pm on our first night and were greeted by a very stern gentleman at reception. No welcome or friendly smile, it was almost as if we were inconveniencing him. We were taken to room 105, just to the right of the reception. I was a little disappointed by the room; I had expected something grander and bigger judging by the photos on their website. The bath was tiny, so no relaxing soaks after a hard days walking. We opened the shutters to be greeted by a view of a wall even though we had requested a room with a good view. We had also requested a superior double, but not sure that this is what we got. Another factor that worried me on arrival was that our room was right next to the reception counter and right in front of the breakfast area. During our stay we were woken on numerous occasions by the reception telephone ringing. We also did not sleep beyond 8.00 any morning due to the breakfast noise. All the rooms seem to be on the one floor so I would presume they all suffer similar problems. The breakfast is very limited but the coffee great and plentiful. During our stay we subsequently met both owners who were, on the whole, charming. The lady at breakfast was also a great character. It rained constantly on our first day in Venice. However, we braved the elements as this hotel is not one that you would want to spend an extended amount of time in - no view, no facilities, no bar, no lounge. In fact, nothing apart from your room and the reception area. If returning to Venice, I would definitely try somewhere else to stay.

The Rialto Bridge is approximately a ten to fifteen minute walk away, with Piazza San Marco being about a further five minute's walk from there. The area of Venice in which the Locanda is situated is wonderful - full of excellent restaurants, shops and sights (including the beautiful church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari and the Scuola Grande di San Rocco) - great for wandering around.

Our room (107) was beautifully decorated, spacious and, most importantly, immaculately clean! What we saw on the Locanda's website was exactly what we got (unlike some other hotels we have stayed in where photos seem to have been taken with an extremely wide angle lens on a good day!). The marble bathroom was similarly spacious (with ample space around the sink for my many products!) and very clean. All the staff we encountered at the Locanda were just wonderful. In particular, the two owners, Leonardo and Federico, were lovely and extremely helpful and gave us a number of recommendations for restaurants and sights, most of which we followed (we didn't follow all only through lack of time) and all of which were fantastic. We were also provided with an excellent map of Venice (on which all recommendations were marked for us to minimise our chances of getting lost), which was very useful. Breakfast consisted of a buffet that included cereal, warmed croissants and bread rolls with assorted jams etc, yoghurt, tea, coffee and hot chocolate.

Locanda Sant'Agostin is a fantastic, homey hotel that provides anything a traveler needs, with undeniable Venetian charm. However, if your idea of an excellent hotel is spa and the beach near the tourist traps, then this is not for you. Locanda Sant'Agostin is the first stop of our 40-day honeymoon. It's literally in the center of Venice, and is not easy to find for first-time Venice visitors. However, once you find the hotel and give yourself a little time to orient yourself to the city, you'll find yourself 15 minutes to all corners of Venice--not just the touristy St. Marco Square area. The hotel is situationed in a regular Venetian neighborhood right next to one of the many small Venetian squares. Our room on the second floor opens up to the square and has a view of a narrow canal and a cute bridge. The breakfast room is beautiful, if not big. The bathroom is generously sized for European standards and the rooms air-conditioned, which is important in the hot summer time. There is a great pizza place around the corner that will give you some delicious cheap bites if you're on the run or on a bugdet. If you want to try some great Italian food, the concierge gives some good suggestions that will provide a glimpse into authentic Italian cuisine. The service is first-rate. The first morning after we arrived, management spent time going over the city map with us and pointed out all the shortcuts and city highlights. On our second day in town, we ran into an American couple travelling with their grandchildren who were obviously lost. We brought them back to our hotel and the management spent a good 20 minutes to help them contact their hotels and a happy ending was had by all. Don't believe the reviews that says Sant'Agostin is only 5 minutes away from St. Marco's. It really is more like a leisurely stroll of 15 minutes or a 10-minute brisk walk to Rialto, and another 5 minutes to St. Marco. However, Venice is a Pedestrian city, and we thouroughly enjoyed every stroll we took. Another note of caution--the hotel entrance is on the second floor at the end of a one-flight (carpeted and very wide) stairway.

So for starters, the price is just unbeatable. We stayed for 3 days in room 105 I believe. As you read here in other reviews, it is true, the owners running this small hotel are very nice, charming, decent people, they recommended several places to eat and see before we even asked for any help and speak good english. The room has an entrance way with a very nice sized, clean modern bathroom off to the side before a second door where you actually get into the bedroom - this just added to the space of the room and I thought it was a nice setup. So when I opened the door to the actual bedroom I was stunned at the size of the room given this price, a king bed, plenty of room to walk around, a desk, and on another wall a sofa bed. And then I look up and realize that the ceiling is about 20 feet high, no kidding. The decor was lovely. This size and space in Venice at this price, very very impressive. The hotel is about a 5-7 minute walk to San Marco square. Its perfect, you walk through a few squares where the locals live and truly get the feel of Venice. I dont know why anyone would want to stay right on the square where the mobs are when you can have this little piece and quiet only 5 minutes away. There is a great bar a few doors down with a very freindly young staff and outdoor tables in a little square by a canal where you can wind down before going to sleep. I cant say enough about this place, the room, the owners, the location and the price, and the ceilings! I not only would stay here again, I will stay here again. Save your money, you can spend 3 times as much to get a big hotel with a fancy lobby, but your are not in Venice to stay in the hotel lobby. I stopped at the Daniel for a beer and a drink in their fancy lobby and paid 23 Euros. I stopped off at the bar around the corner from Locanda and we had about 3 beers and 3 drinks for the same price in a much more Venitian atmosphere sitting outside along a nice little canal bridge.

Our family of five booked a triple room and a double room. Both were absolutely gorgeous, with lots of space, a sparkling bathroom, and air conditioning that actually worked! The brother owners, Frederico and Leonardo, were gracious hosts and more concerned about the happiness of their guests than any place I've ever stayed. Breakfast, included, was delicious. The young lady that served coffee and hot chocolate didn't speak a word of English but still managed to tease our 17 year old and prod him into having \"one more cup\" of hot chocolate. She was delightful! The Locanda is centrally located, about a 15 minute walk home from wherever you happen to be in Venice. We loved the city and will definitely be back. When we return, the Sant Agostin is the only place we'll consider staying. One point to be aware of.... The hotel entrance is up about 25 steps from the street. If you have lots of luggage or a physical issue that makes stairs difficult, it's going to be a challenge.

Take his recommendations on restaurants too - they were all excellent. The location is perfect, in the center of this incredibly beautiful town, about 10 minutes walk form Rialto and train station. Leonardo helped us out with our bags, and we were sad to see the Locanda Sant'Agostin disappear behind us. But once we got home, there was an email waiting for us from Leonardo, thanking us and wishing us well. And that, in itself, is what recommends the Locanda Sant'Agostin.", "Date": "March 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spokane, WA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in Great Location\u201d", "Author": "ejworden", "ReviewID": "UR3274926", "Content": "We spent two nights in this great hotel. The staff was super nice and gave us a great list of places to eat and we ended up eating at Antica Birraria La Corte both nights because of the great food and decent prices and is only like a 2 minute walk from the hotel. Rooms were super clean and really quiet. The wine at the Taverna next door was excellent and a great place to hang out. I also liked that it was not right in the middle of the tourist areas and more Italians in the neighborhood than tourists. Great Place and would stay there again!!", "Date": "March 15, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Locanda Sant'Agostin", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d258872-Reviews-Locanda_Sant_Agostin-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$152 - $253*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">S Polo 2344</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Campo Sant'Agostin</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30125</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "258872", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/3e/bb/70/locanda-sant-agostin.jpg"}}
