I may have had a more negative view as i let my husband choose the hotel and i wanted another one that was rated 21 on trip advisor out of 500 and was only \u00a310 more than this hotel. First impressions weren't great although the staff when we first arrived were helpful. We had booked a king size room but when my husband asked about having a room with the Sagrada Familia view we were told it would be 30 euros extra per night. I have seen some reviews saying that people were given the room with the view for free. Anyway as we were not willing to pay we were given the option of a king bed with a 'court yard' view or twin beds on the street side. We went for the court yard view which turned out to be a room with no window outside but a window facing out to the foyer. The lights are amazing on the glass in the foyer but the sounds was quite noisy. After a coupe of nights i did get used to it though but did have ear plugs. I also thought it was going to be very light but they did have two sets of blinds, one being black out blinds which have a button so you can just press to open or close. Our room was also a disabled room so we didn't have the fancy shower people talk about. The room was cleaned very thoroughly and we were sure we were given clean towels every day. Personally it didn't bother me that there was no tea or coffee facilities. The bed was very hard but again i didn't mind. The tube station is only 2 minute walk so was easy to get around although we did walk into the centre on our first day which was a pleasant walk but our legs were so tired we decided to get the tube as much as possible after that! We arrived on Bank Holiday Monday and didn't want to go to far to look for our evening meal. There were a lot of cafes but not many restaurants in the area although they could have just been closed as it was a bank holiday. When we did eat here we found it very expensive compared to side streets off Las Ramblas. Obviously this was because of the Sagrada Familia. The roof top terrace views are amazing. They were definitely an amazing plus about the hotel. We were fobbed off about the air con. One day the guy at reception said he could change the temp for the floor and then the next day it was on heat again and we were told by someone else that the temp was on cool in the day but warm in the evening and it seems you can't over ride it in your room. There is a supermarket next door which was very handy to buy water for the room. Overall the hotel was okay just feel it wasn't great. Once i overcame the noisy room i loved Barcelona!", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "newcastle upon tyne", "Title": "\u201cgood solid hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "magpiejim", "ReviewID": "UR127372663", "Content": "My wife and I just got back from Barcelona, having spent 4 nights on a pleasure trip. this hotel is a really great option for seeing all of the sights and is 2 minutes walk from Sagrada Famillia metro station.

We booked through Easyjet Holidays and the flights plus hotel deal was great value. we had breakfast included in the deal and this is the usual buffet choice which you can really fill up on, I am not sure I would have paid E15 pp for it however when it is easy to get a good 3 course restaurant lunch for E10 almost anywhere in the city. the hotel has a roof terrace with stupendous views of the Sagrada.

The hotel is on a main street and at night the traffic noise madeit difficult to sleep ( more the Spanish use of the horn rather than engine noise). I would question the 4 star status of the Rosellon due to the fact that there is no restaurant. A breakfast room and a bar serving snacks and tapas only. The breakfast was more than adequate (continental buffet) and nicely laid out. A cooked breakfast was available if you requested it from the staff, a fact I learned on morning 3. When I did ask for cooked it arrived promptly and well cooked. All complaints aside the saving grace of this hotel is its location 1 block from the Sagrada Familia and from the roof terrace of the hotel there is a magnificent view of the church from a new angle, also the views of the rest of Barcelona are magnificent.

The beds were good and the sheets very nice. Not too noisy if you kept the window closed. Pay attention to the two sets of blinds, there's a permanent light at the balcony so I went to the reception to ask how I should turn it off - they said there was no way to do that, but there are double blinds so that was ok. Not too many restaurants around, but the biggest plus was the 2 minute-walk to Sagrada Familia and the metro - take the purple line and you're in Placa de Catalunya in 15 minutes tops. I thought it was a little expensive for the quality of the accommodations, but overall the proximity to SF was totally paying off.

Well when I got their no rooms were available, they said if I came back by 2pm I could get the room with the window. Sat down in the lobby area to sort out my suitcase and 15mins later the room was ready. Very pleased as I got a room with a view to the Sagrada Familia. Room is a little small but still spacious enough!! Flat screen TV showing quite a few channels in english which was great \u2013 I would watch BBC in the mornings whilst getting ready for a day of pounding the streets.

The hotel is in a great area, right opposite the Sagrada Familia \u2013 lots of shops and restaurants around \u2013 supermarket shops and little stores are all within 5mins, as well as local restaurants serving the usual Spanish type foods, they also have mcdonalds, kfc & burger king all within 5mins walking distance if you have a fussy eater or are with children with you. Souvenier shops are also in the immediate area. Metro is literally round the corner. Make sure you come out at the entrance Ave Guadi otherwise you\u2019ll be walking all the way round, but still a lovely walk anyway as you have the church in full view all the time. The one small thing I would say is the Hotel need to provide a better informed handbook for the room \u2013 there is no guide for the channels and my main thing was that for my entire stay I didn\u2019t realize their were 2 (electronic) blinds.

The decor is modern, as can be seen from the website. The staff speaks pretty good English. The breakfast is good, a typical European spread. The best thing about the hotel is its location so near La Sagrada Familia, including a lovely view from the rooftop. There are a few cautions, however. The location is great for La Sagrada Familia and is close to metro locations if that is how you plan to get around Barcelona, but other than that, there isn't really anything near to walk to or enjoy. We stayed on a Sunday and were chagrined to find out that since the neighborhood isn't \"touristic\" most of the good restaurants were closed. That left a choice of tapas restaurants, none of whom took credit cards. This was distressing because it was our last day in Europe and we were running low on Euros in cash. Since the hotel could not provide an exchange, we had to have lunch in the hotel restaurant so we could charge it to the room. (Luckily the food was good and the beer priced right.) We were unable to check in early, but the hotel stored our bags for us while we explored the neighborhood. At 1:30 p.m., they were able to offer a room, but only a choice between an interior room with a King bed or a street-side room with two twins. Since we had pre-paid for the room with Travelocity, I'm not sure if we got the type of room we should have, but did end up choosing the king bed, which was firm and comfortable. Others have commented on not being able to get the room cool enough, but I suspect that may be due to the programming of the thermostat. It was a little tricky to figure out, but once we did, we were able to make the room a very comfortable cool temperature for sleeping. The staff was mostly helpful, but they didn't seem to be very knowledgeable about the area. When we asked for dinner recommendations, they seemed at a loss. Luckily, the hotel offers free wireless internet, so we hopped on Trip Advisor to make some choices.

Yes, the Sagrada is covered in cranes, but it provided a wonderful backdrop for my engagement, so I don't care too much about that. Food and drink wise, head away from this expensive tourist area and try the Born area, at Jaume metro stop on the yellow line. Here you'll find lovely patisseries and street cafes. Back to the hotel anyway. It's very functional, pretty but clinical and has a good array of bathroom miniatures. Perfect for those like us who travel with hand baggage only. The beds are rather firm but hospitable, and the aircon can be noisy, but I found that turning the bathroom lights off helped with this.

The room is clutterfree and stylish with a large and modern bathroom. The hotel-rooftop is open to all visitors (until 10 pm) and offers a stunning panorama of the city. You can opt for the (fine but quite 'standard') breakfast buffet which isn't cheap at 12 euro's per person, or you can have your breakfast in any of Barcelona's many, many, many eateries. Around the corner you'll find the subway/underground/metro-station (whichever term you prefer) 'Sagrada Famiglia' which gives you access to lines L5 en L2: you'll be downtown (say Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya) in about 7 to 10 minutes. So this hotels location (quiet sidestreet, Sagrada Famiglia around the corner, easy access to public transport, just a short ride downtown) is a recommendation in itself. If we were pressed to suggest an improvement then we would advise the hotel-management to shut off the exterior lighting on the back of the building after, say, 11 pm: it shines quite brightly into the rooms, possibly disturbing their guests sleep (our there environmental consciousness).

The hotel makes much of its rooftop terrace, which does have great views of the city and the spires of the Sagrada Familia (the latter also visible from the breakfast room). However the restaurant wasn't open when we visited. No explanation was given so we assumed it was due to being low season. There are plenty of good restaurants a short walk away on the Diagonal leading up from the Sagrada Familia, so it wasn't a problem, but maybe should be made more explicit when booking. Overall, a good hotel at a reasonable rate. It worked well as a base for sightseeing, particularly if you are not keen on nightlife and not worried about being away from the main drag of the Ramblas.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel, Great location, Great staff\u201d", "Author": "IvanLeafs", "ReviewID": "UR85168773", "Content": "This hotel is a gem, located a stones throw away from Sagrada Familia.

Some users have suggested asking for Sagrada Familia view rooms. I would question whether it is worth the extra 18 Euros as the rooms on the road are virtually identical and are as quiet as any hotel I have ever been to.

The workers at reception were friendly and spoke very good english however they weren't as helpful as some of the other hotels we stayed at - they were very vague in their responses to us like when we asked about catching the train to the airport. Also, there was wi-fi in the hotel, but we couldn't get a signal in our room, we had to go out into the hallway to use it. The location of the hotel is great, it steps away from a metro stop and a stone's throw away from one of the most brilliant pieces of architecture in the world - the Sagrada Familia.

The hotel is clean and comfortable (sheets impeccable and crisp, bathroom spotless - our two most important considerations at hotels). Our group consisted of two separate parties and we arrived approximately 4 hours before the scheduled check in time after a long flight from Singapore. The staff speak decent English and were very accommodating, checking us in immediately. We had a double room (the most basic). The bed was comfortable (two singles pushed together) and the room has blockout blinds to eliminate noise and light if that's your thing. The bathroom is large and modern, with a massive shower head and excellent water pressure, which we sorely appreciated after our long flight and the ensuing long hot walks around Barcelona. The hotel is getting a bit shabbier than shown in the photos, but if, like us, you do not intend to spend much time in the hotel and are after a clean and decent room at a reasonable price, this hotel ticks all the boxes. Be sure to request a non-smoking room if required. Our friend was given a smoking room and you can smell the difference. Now, the location. Honestly, if you threw a rock hard enough, you'd hit the Sagrada Familia. Be sure to take a trip up to the rooftop terrace for a breathtaking view, even if you're not a hotel-rooftop-terrace kind of person. It's amazing. The closest metro stop is about 50 metres away. The Passeig de Gracia shopping district is two stops away, and the hotel's stop is also well connected to the lovely El Born area and, of course, La Rambla. The hotel is surrounded by supermarkets and pharmacies (which ended up being more useful than we expected). Other info: the hotel cafe does a good coffee and breakfast and has a pretty decent (though limited) sandwich/focaccia menu for days when you have an early start (Barcelona does not wake up until 10 or 11am).

Two tips for your sightseeing - If you want to see flamenco but don't want to pay over 90 to 120 euros for a show and not very good meal then go to Tarantos at Placa Reial. Shows from 8pm and last about 30 minutes- nothing fancy but they can dance and it costs 8 euros! Sagrada familia - costs 12 euros each to go in but not a lot to see at the moment as only a very small section open. Lift is another 2.5 euros but with a 2 hour queue we decided not to wait. Had we have known we would have saved our money and viewed sagrada from the street. Despite all the comments about robbery in Barcelona, we never saw anything and all the catalonians were really friendly.

Coming from the airport, we took the airport bus out and got off the Universitat stop whereby we then hopped on a train to get to sagrada familia station. We decided to buy the 3 day train pass which also enables unlimited rides on all of Barcelona's public transportation network for around 15 euros. This turned out to be a good decision as opposed to buying the hop on hop off bus option as Barcelona's public transportation network is in my opinion one of the best in the world and serviced all main attractions (plus, the hop on hop off option finished its runs at 8pm which was actually too early, especially if you want to stay up to watch the opera or view the magic fountain which starts at 9pm). Barcelona's public transportation networks is clean with services running on time and usually every few minutes. Very impressive!
