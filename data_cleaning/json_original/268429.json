The staff was excellent, very friendly and very helpful assisting us with our needs (arranging taxi rides, dinner suggestions, etc.). It was a $17 taxi ride from the airport and took anywhere from 10-30 minutes depending on traffic. The hotel itself was not that nice. The room was a little cramped and definitely needed a little better cleaning. The pool was pretty small and the whirlpool and lounge chairs on the roof could have used some better cleaning as well.

I think the A/C unit just needed to be cleaned as it was the source of the dust bunnies but it was spewing them all over the room. We notified the front desk of the situation and they promptly moved us to a different room which was in the same condition as the first time we stayed (reasonably clean) and apologized profusely. The included continental breakfast was nothing special but was good enough for us; pastries, fruit, juices, etc. The price was one of the better ones we found and was in the lower middle of the pack and after reading reviews on Trip Advisor more expensive hotels had similar problems to those described above.

(don't expect all that much from the continental breakfast though) Good location, safe neighborhood, close enough to airport and Old San Juan. 24-hour Walgreens right around the corner. Cons: The \"complimentary wireless internet\" was a let down. Might have been a fluke, but none of the available networks had strong enough signals for us to connect to from the room. Staff said it was because of the weather, and we should just go to the common area where the routers are. Rooms are small- FYI if you book the \"Double\" (i.e. cheapest) room, the room itself is barely bigger than the bed.

As usual I read plenty of reviews before making the decision to book 4 nights at Coral Princess. One of the reviewers mentioned that there were no dead bolts on the doors and his girlfriend had been afraid the first night. But since the property has a buzzer to let people in, I felt no major concern with the comment. Well, my room was on the 2nd floor between the stairs and an open door that gave access to a terrace. It made me feel a bit unsafe especially because mine was the only room on that portion of the wall. I went to sleep the first night and maybe 15 minutes later; my room door was suddenly opened from the outside. The only thing that held it from being ajar was the chain. I almost had a heart attack\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I screamed!!The door was closed again from the outside and I jumped out of my bed, made myself a bit presentable and went to the front desk- literally SHAKING. The front desk clerk was a very young girl who said that it was her who opened the door by mistake. All she said was that she started sweating \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but no apology or acknowledgement from her part. I asked why she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say anything; at least an explanation / apology through the door would have made a big difference. As a frequent traveler, I take the time to sing praises to front desk staff that shines and makes a difference during my stay, but in this case\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I was dumbfounded. After the incident, I requested a room with more activity around it, and she gave me a room on the 1st floor, close to the main lobby entrance and it was an upgrade from my original room. But this experience showed me a lack of people skills to handle an unexpected situation and the need for more training for this particular staff member. The two other attendees were extremely professional, seasoned people who showed me the true character of Coral Princess during check in, inquiries and check out. Will I go back to Coral Princess? Not sure based on lack of dead bolts- since I always travel solo to PR. But if you want a property right in the middle of Condado, super clean, with breakfast and common areas to relax plus mini bar in every room, then give it a try.

The deadbolt on the door had been removed. Only a 15 dollar doorknob and pushbutton lock were on the door. The door had gaps around it that let in a substantial amount of light from the hallway. Everytime someone came inside the hotel the tile floors outside echoed loudly into the room. When other rooms on our floor shut their door, our door shook noisily. Placing a towel at the bottom of the door seemed to help some. It took my girlfriend several hours to get to sleep. We were both awoken by hallway and front door noise countless times throughout the night. There was a large hair in the bathroom, otherewise the room seemed adequately clean. The common areas were filthy, especially the tile floors where I saw the hugest hairball I've ever seen on the second floor landing. Most of the common furniture was very dirty. The room itself was small, approximately 12 feet by 10 feet without the bathroom. The hottub on the roof was filthy and the terrace to the third floor where the hottub was located was locked at night. The pool was very small. The hotel was located very close to the beach, walgreens, and numerous local restaurants and bars. It was hard to get a feel for the neighborhood. Some homes close by were nice and others were dilapidated. We saw no locals at night on Magdaleena in front of the hotel, and only a handful of tourists. The hotel had a very friendly staff, who were always smiling and courteous as you walked in the door. The outdoor garden patio area was a nice touch. My girlfriend loved the breakfast choices. Although it was not a true buffet, she was extremely excited to wake up and go down there to eat she liked it so much. If we had to do it over, we would have booked a room in advance at the Mariott. The Mariott was clean, had an excellent pool, and was not obnoxiously noisy like some of the places we visited in Isle Verde. The beach was directly out the back door off the pool area. We will not stay at the Coral Princess again.

Our room (19) was not large, and does not have much of a \"view\", but it was very clean and pleasant. Mattress was on the firm side, not terrible. And the hotel only has 4 dedicated parking spaces, but we usually had no problem getting one, and there is street parking and a pay lot one easy block away that only charges $13 for 24 hours, with in/out privileges. Those minor things aside, we had a very pleasant stay at the Coral Princess. It is an attractive 3-story building located on a pleasant city street, one block from Ashford Avenue (the \"main drag\"), two blocks from the beach. It is in easy walking distance of countless restaurants of all types and price ranges (and, I assume, nightlife). (There is a Walgreens right around the corner for those forgotten items.) It has very quick and easy access to Hwy 26 (airport, Old San Juan, etc.). Again, the room is not large and does not have much view, but it was very clean and attractive, with nice artwork on the wall, etc. Big plus for me was the minibar with $2 Cerveza Medalla and $1 soda / bottled water (the $25 bottle of wine on the other hand is a bit pricier, but I don't think PR is exactly known as a wine capital...). The staff was friendly and attentive, someone was on duty / at the desk 24x7. They were always very helpful with directions, recommendations, etc. We had a slight problem with our ceiling fan that did take one reminder, at which time they fixed it quickly and were very apologetic about it. The third floor has a number of very spacious, nicely furnished \"common rooms\" including a kitchen and pool table, and there is a very cool roof deck with a huge wraparound sofa, assorted chairs, lounges, hot tub, etc., as well as a great view of the surrounding Condado skyline. There are also a number of attractive, shady patio areas scattered all around the hotel. The common rooms plus roof deck plus all of the patio areas could easily accommodate a party for well over a hundred people, even though there are only 20-25 rooms in the whole hotel...! Breakfast is included, buffet-style. Fairly standard fare -- nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about either. But there is plenty of variety (ham / hard boiled eggs to cereal / yogurt), and certainly plenty of food -- you won't leave hungry. And it is served by one of the shady patio areas, so there are a lot of nice little places to sit and eat. There is a small pool / small pool area -- never had a chance to get in.

The positive attributes of the Coral Princess Hotel are numerous: The hotel is centrally located in the Condado area. It is a small, chic European style hotel with a rooftop garden area that is a wonderful and inviting refuge to lounge and read. The staff is exceptionally charming, friendly and accommodating. The rooms are very clean, well lighted and comfortable with properly working internet access. The hotel does have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free parking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but there are only 4 spaces allotted for it on the hotel property which is directly in front of the hotel and off the street. It is a on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153first come, first served\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd basis, so if all 4 spaces are taken then you must find your own parking on the street or in a parking lot. Unfortunately our car was broken into while parked in one of the 4 free spaces directly in front of the hotel and its security camera. Our rental car\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back rear passenger side window was smashed and the radio was stolen at approximately 530AM. The Police were called around 7am when this was discovered to file a report. I met with the Police as they filed the report and heard from the Police directly that several cars in the last few months have been broken into, in exactly the same way as our rental car had been, AND in the same small parking area provided by the hotel. The Police complained to me and the hotel staff that they are NEVER able to see the security camera\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tape recording of the previous night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s events as requested so that they could possible apprehend the person responsible. I pursued the issue of the security camera\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tape recording with the hotel staff over the next couple of days, hoping that there would be something on the camera to help the Police find the person or persons responsible for mine and previous break-ins and to eliminate future guests from the hassle of having their cars broken into. Ultimately I found out that the security camera is NOT working! Thus, my complaint about this hotel. The hotel bills itself as an upper-end property with free parking provided by the hotel. The staff and owners of the hotel are aware of theft and vandalism with cars parked on their hotel property. That their security camera is not working and available to the police is not acceptable by a property such as this. Especially since there is a repeated occurrence of break-ins according to the Police and actual hotel staff I spoke to. I lost a day of my vacation dealing with insurance issues and returning a damaged car for a new one, I would hope that the hotel would take this seriously for future guests and for the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own reputation as a safe and reputable place to stay. From what the room rates charged are at this hotel, it should have a working security camera which is available to the Police if needed.

Absolutely loved the Coral Pricess! It is in the Candado neighborhood. The rooms are clean and more than adequate. Yes, they are smaller than the standard hotel room, but this is a 70 year old facility. If you are a single female this is a great, safe place. You do have to buzz at the door and they let you in.. Our room was large enough that we had a double bed, desk, small table and chairs and wine cooler/refrigerator. Soda and water were a dollar. The wine was twenty five. We went to Wallgreens around the conner and got a 24 pack of water for $3.99. Plent of room left for leftovers or whatever. Bed was comfy. Bathroom was spotless and had a small whirlpool tub. Yes the water pressure and temperature do vary at times, but that was no big deal. They do change out your towels daily. They do not change your sheets daily, but do you do that at home? If you ask I am sure they would do that. Our safe did not work and they were kind enough to bring us another one that did work. Do not believe that breakfast is \"meager\". It is not. They had croissants, pastries, bread for toast, waffles, fruit, cheese, ham, yogurt, boiled eggs and cereal. The coffee/espresso/hot chocolate machine was wonderful. So were the juices. The pool is about 12 x 25 and great after a hot day. It is in the shade in the afternoon which is so nice after a day of activities to come back and relax in comfortable water in the shade. You will need beach towels. These are not provided. If you forget them, Wallgreens had beach towels at a reasonable price.(prices at Walllgreens are comprable to the home they have everything you could ever want and are open 24/7).) Rooftop lounge area is really nice with the hottub. The beach is a short walk. You can take the bus to other beaches. All are public beaches-even at the hotels.At some you can rent chairs and umbrellas. Ocean Park at Isla Verde is a family beach with jet-skis, para surf boards and wind surfing for rent. Good roadside hot dog/ smoothie vendors as well. You can leave your books there in the reading room if you don't want to tote them home. We took used paper backs and left them. There is a washer and dryer as well. Two dollars to wash and two to dry. Pack half of what you think you will need.The hotel staff was most accommadating and can give you directions to where you want to go. We went to the Marcado on Saturday night, about a 6 block walk (even had to go under I 26 and it was well lit and safe) to see what the residents do to relax. Lots of music and families If you stay out of where you don't belong, you will be fine. Ashford Ave is blocked off on Saturday and Sunday evenings for a food/drink/music fest. Fun to go and wander around.Food prices can be expensive if you add in alcohol.Do try the mom and pop restaurants and try mofongo. Car rental is good at Charlie's (across from the marriott)Recommend that you buy the insurance so you don't have to mess with a mess when you get hit or hit someone. Turn signals are an option and driving is a real trip.Plan to leave the city when thre is the least traffic. We had no problems. Rental for a day was $25.00. Go to the rain forest. A word of caution:do not take small children to the La Mina falls. While it is beautiful and the water is refreshing, you are hiking nearly a mile down a mountain and then a mile back up. Your child will be worn out and you don' want to carry them.Wear sensible shoes and take a pair of aqua socks or sandals for the rocks. Old San Juan is fun as well. The forts are great and the shopping is fun. You can't see it all on one trip. After staying here we will be back.

Originally we booked a resort in the same neighborhood Condado. We switched our reservation to the Coral Princess because of the better price and same location, so we could put our money towards activities like ziplining and snorkeling. The location was good - quick walk to restaurants, Walgreens, the resorts with the casinos, and Condado Beach. Only 4 parking spots for hotel guests for free. Otherwise, we had to park down a little more than a block away for $13 a day. The room was very small compared to other hotels at which we have stayed. It was difficult to unpack our suitcases into the closet without bumping into the stand-up clothing steamer that was ineffective. An iron would have worked better and taken up less room space. However, the hotel and our individual room was very clean and had new furniture and fixtures, flat screen TV, large window, etc. The pool was small as another person commented, but clean and good for cooling down. The front desk staff was average. They were fairly welcoming, and gave us directions on how to get around PR and where to eat. However, one night we were looking for a moderately priced restaurant within walking distance from the hotel and they recommended Miro. Miro was just average, probably would not go back if in San Juan again. They had 2 for 1 drink specials and live music. My meal was good, nothing wrong with it, but not spectacular. My husband's meal was inedible. He ordered a steak and what he got was a flame broiled piece of solid fat. The front desk staff also recommended a restaurant called Marmalade in Old San Juan which was very good - fancy, small portions, contemporary decor, overpriced - but that was kind of what we were looking for that night - to splurge.

I arrived in san Juan on the 18th of February with my best frnd at 10pm. We made reservations to stay at the San Juan Beach Hotel on Ashford Ave. in Condado three months prior to our arrival. Once we reached our hotel destination, to our great suprise, the hotel was oversold and took 2 hours to accomodate us in a room. Once we got into our room, it was an insult to any human's nature. from the rust covered lamp shades to the rusted and moldy ceiling, no towels, blood stained sheets, exposed wires, etc, etc. this place was not up to parr for any guest. We checked out the following morning and had to look for another hotel to stay for our remaining 4 nights. After calling almost every hotel in the area from the least expensive to the most expensive, they were all sold out. Right when we thought, we had hit rock bottom, a very nice cab driver dropped us off in front of the Coral Princess and stated that she heard this was a very nice place and because it was a smaller hotel they might have something available. We walked in with desperate faces and were greeted by the Hotel Manager Emmie, Emmie was our vacation hero, she had one room left on the executive floor which contains a jacuzzi, amazing executive lobby and out door veranda to mention the least. The only downfall was, that they too were fully booked for that sunday. She had 3 out of the 4 night available, She was extremely helpful, attentive and truly showed concern for our unfortunate situation. We ended up booking the room and hoping for the best to happen on sunday. To our relief, a room became available on that sunday and it all worked out great!.

The price is right, supurb customer service, the hotel is very clean, the rooms are very comfortable, premium quality beds and bedding, Beautifully decorated, conveniently located in the heart of Condado, outdoor pool, complimentary delicious continental breakfast, etc, etc. and the icing on the cake is the extremely attentive, personable, friendly and just plain ol amazing staff. These people have created one of the best team i have ever experienced. I give this hotel 6 out of 5 stars. I will only stay at the Coral princess for all of my visits to san juan, given that i am there 4-6 times a year. *YOU MUST STAY HERE* Please excuse any typos, I am doing this as well as a million other things.

Grab a brochure of things to do that's in the lobby and plan your trip out. My friend and I took this route and in a weeks time, walked through Old San Juan, visited \"El Yunque\", did some shopping at \"Mall de la Americas\" and kayaked through the luminescent lagoon with the same tourist company.

We were given room 2 which is a windowless cell. Okay there was a small window that looked onto an internal staircase but there was no external view. the bed was a standard size 4Ft 6\". the bathroom had a very swish glass sink on a pedestal but nowhere to put your tooth brush. We met an American lady who had refused the room. We tried but the place was full. Our friends were given room one opposite that was fine AND they had a king sized bed.

The pool is no more than a plunge pool, the roof top terrace is only available when the apartment isnt being used and it isnt raining. There are lots of plants in pots around the place which give it a nice feel. I suppose the review is slightly tempered by the weather which was awful. The staff were fine, they even agreed to look after our luggage when we returned from the cruise we had booked until our onward flight was due at no cost Compared to the hotel on St Lucia, the Coral Princess seemed over priced but I suppose thats what you get for being in the middle of the cruise ship capital.

For starters, the staff is superb and could not have been more helpful. When the rental car agency couldn't come and pick us up at the hotel, we were driven there. When we had trouble printing our boarding passes, they made sure we got it done. Etc, etc. There are many pockets of open-air gathering spots sprinkled through the hotel, which we loved. There were chairs, coffee tables and a loveseat in one such spot right outside our room (#24), where we would go for at least part of every night to watch the moon and stars, drink some wine, and talk. There is also a rooftop patio, with lots of chairs and a hot tub. We liked that too, and of course it also added to the romance of the stay. Same for the garden breakfast area. Open-air, a lot of plants and color, some sunshine...a nice way to start each day. There is also a well-decorated common reading room with a lot of seating - and a pool table - but we didn't use any of that. Nor did we use the pool, which is in the shade in the afternoon. White tile floors throughout, which gave a very clean feel, including our room. Inside #24, a black-and-tan color scheme against the white tile, which worked really well for us...as did the oh-so-comfy and soft bed. Great neighborhood too. Safe at all hours, so close to everything we needed, and right between the airport and Old San Juan. I'll go slightly off-track here and comment on the photos one of the previous reviewers posted. I'm going to guess he's a bit naive and inexperienced...and I'll leave it at that. He posted 5 pix, I think - and THREE of those were NOT by the Coral Princess. They were taken on Ashford, the main street in the Condado, and at least three blocks away from the hotel. If you keep going down Ashford a few more blocks, you'll come to Vuitton, Cartier, and several other exclusive boutique stores. So yes, photos can be deceiving. It got to where we'd make a game of it - \"Find the Danger.\" Never could, but it was worth a laugh. One final comment. Another reviewer described the breakfast as having a \"coffee dispenser.\" That's a bit like saying a Porsche is \"a car.\" While the overall breakfast was probably the weakest part of our stay, the WMF 1400 they use is a first-class machine, and puts out the very best coffee we have ever had. I don't think that's what they're serving up at Burger King., and if you love coffee, you're in for a treat.

We stayed on and off at the coral princess for another month because my husband couldn't fly for a month, doctors orders.

Our one complaint was low water pressure and temperature variation in the shower. That is the only reason why we couldn't give a higher rating on the room. The other review comments of the neighborhood are factual: there is graffiti, etc. - but unfortunately that is everywhere in the world. At no time did we feel unsafe.

The hotel staff was very helpful about restaurants and driving directions (GREAT tip to take the toll road to El Yunque - thanks again). Breakfast was good; nothing fancy: cereal, canned and fresh fruit, ham, cheese, instant oatmeal, croissants and an awesome coffee/cappuccino/hot chocolate maker. The pool is tiny, the rooftop patio has a hot tub and there is an impressive amount of plants everywhere on the grounds.

The ceiling fan worked great - so much that I could go without the air condition at night. Here are a few things I didn't see in other reviews that might be helpful.

The room was very clean and had a cordless phone, small TV, high-speed wired internet, and a drink fridge. Everything worked well, no problems with infrastructure.

At checkout there was a place to store my luggage until my plane left, unfortunately they give access to this unattended area to all guests so if you're really worried about your stuff getting stolen I wouldn't recommend it. I loved the area as it is a mix of hotels, businesses, and residential. There are a few down home restaurants up the block, a Walgreens around the corner, and you really are 4 min from the beach. This would have been a five-star review BUT in checking my credit card bill online a week after I stayed I discovered a $1500 overcharge that had cleared (not just held). I called them the next day. They were apologetic and blamed a systems error and in fact had already put through a refund before I called. The refund did indeed show up the next day with a entry date from before I made my call. I believe this was an honest mistake, but it still was quite a shock. Would it stop me from coming back? I don't think so, I enjoyed my stay too much at half the price of other hotels, and thought they handled their mistake as well as possible.

I found them listed on hotels.com with a price of $115 per night, but no mention of the bed size, and we wanted a queen or bigger. I decided to contact the hotel directly and they offered me a queen bed at $135 a night, which seemed a little high, but I decided the extra $20 per night would be okay. Watch out for the additional fees, though. They charged an additional $9.00 per day as a \"maintenance fee\" or something like that, and there is a 14% tax on top of that. We ended up paying $682 for 4 nights, or $170 per night. Now, I was looking for a small, quaint hotel that would bring with it the charm of the local community, and a sense that we were experiencing a part of Puerto Rico. This hotel just didn't offer that. This was a $100 per night hotel at best. For $170 a night, we shouldn't have had the following problems: The first night there, the water would only turn on cold. There were 2 of us, and we turned the knobs every which way trying to get hot water in the shower. Finally, we asked at the desk. They agreed to look at it in the morning while we had breakfast. After, they brought us in, and \"showed us\" how to turn the knob and said the hot water was working all along. There is no way it was working prior to that. Why couldn't they just apologize for having to turn on the water heater? In addition, after breakfast, we brought our coffee back into the room with us while we were getting ready. When they cleaned the room, they didn't remove the empty, used coffee cups. For the price we were paying, I would expect the room to be perfect when we returned for the evening. I ended up having to bring 2 days of coffee cups back out to the breakfast area myself. I know these things seem small, and I would overlook them for a less expensive hotel, but I know there are other hotels in the area that provide better service for the same price. (I had previously stayed at the Wind Chimes Inn and would have booked there again, if they weren't all filled up.) The good things: the courtyard for breakfast was beautiful, but don't expect anything very healthy (yogurt with lots of sugar, pastries, and processed cheese and ham... they also had cereal, but only cornflakes.) The bed was the right size, but it was just outside the courtyard, so when people would congregate for breakfast, they woke us up every morning. No need to set an alarm! The rooms were cleaned well except for the coffee cup issue, and the location was great. If you are going to stay here, I would ask NOT to have a room near the courtyard, and be careful about pricing. I see another post here that states a room with a king bed was only $125 a night. I don't know why my price was higher. They also \"recommend\" that you tip the maid $3 per day. I usually tip the maid, anyway, but I just felt like they were nickle and diming me with this suggested tip as well. Make it $173 per night. I have never given a bad review to a hotel on trip advisor before, and I still highly recommend Wind Chimes Inn if you are looking for a hotel in the Condado area.

Right near a Walgreens, a short walk to Condado Beach and ocean walkway, and a short drive to old San Juan. It was actually better to stay outside of the San Juan area b/c of the large volume of tourists off of multiple cruise liners drinking and some sketchy characters ready to take advantage of tourists. The place is beautiful and friendly during the day though, lots of families flying kites by the fort. The rooms at the Coral Inn although small, were comfortable and priced right (unlike other larger hotels) It had more of a boutique feel, lots of plants that kept the hotel cool and relaxing. The upper level had a common area w/ a pool table and the rooftop had a jacuzzi tub. The only negative is parking, there is only maybe 4 spots which is bad if you have a rental car, they suggest you go to a nearby lot and pay the fee which they would discount, we could not find that lot! (the road signs were in spanish, we quickly picked up what they meant, although getting from the rental place to the hotel via the highway was very interesting...lol!) We were so eager to get into the clear blue water at the beach which was gorgeous. Later in our trip, we were told that that stretch of beach was known for shark sightings! My suggestion....don't swim out too far and avoid the rip tides! Overall, this small hotel is underrated and probably deserves more stars than the more known and frequented hotels in the area.

The area is loaded with restaurants. We'd never been to Puerto Rico, and wanted to try local dishes. The staff recommended the Cafe d'Angel (I hope I spelled it right.), which was very close by. It was superb! Try the mifungo. You won't regret it. The hotel also serves a Continental Breakfast which was very good. The Condado Beach is only an easy 2 minute walk. Shopping is nearby, as you are close to a main thoroughfare. We felt comfortable walking in the area, even at night. Everyone we met was friendly and helpful, and no one seemed to mind speaking English. Some reviewers had different opinions on that, and perhaps we were simply more fortunate. I think tho', if you are pleasant to the people there, they will respond the same. As I said, we only stayed overnight, so we can't give a complete description of everything.

(I communicated with the hotel via email before our visit and found everyone to be extremely helpful). Janisse and Glenda were particularly helpful and pleasant during our entire stay!! We expected the rooms to be extremely small, however, found our room to be more than ample. We were in room #24 which is on the second floor in the back area of the hotel. We definitely recommend requesting one of these rooms. The floors are marble throughout the room and bathroom. The bathroom had a shower/tub combo and the tub had jacuzzi jets which was a pleasant surprise as well. The closet/wardrobe has drawers and provides limited space for hanging clothes. The courtyard area was beautiful and the continental breakfast each morning was more than sufficient (croissants, ham, cheese, waffles, oatmeal, juices). The room had a mini fridge stocked with beer, water and wine. The bottles of water were only $1 and the beer was $2 which is much less you would expect for a minibar. One note - they do not have a full size ironing board in your room, so be prepared to use a small tabletop board if you must iron. The location of the hotel is perfect - we ate at 2 great restaurants on Magdalena (hotel's street): Cieto Lindo (Mexican) and Ramiros (fine dining). The beach is about a 3 minute walk straight up from the hotel. Walgreens, as everyone mentioned is right around the corner and open 24 hours. The bus (B21) drops you off almost right in front of the hotel. Note: if you ride the buses make certain to have change as they don't accept bills or credit cards.

We visited the caves on the west side and biobay on the east side and the rain forest - which is a must. And Old San Juan too which is just a bunch of shopping except for the two forts. First off, we picked up our rental car and drove towards the hotel. People in Puerto Rico tend to drive fast and change lanes often. Growing up in a big city, I'm used to congestion but changing lanes without signals and very often is a little unnerving. Anyway, we found that we missed our turnoff for the hotel and ended up in Old San Juan. No big deal, the street turns around there due to ocean and takes you right back to Condado and basically straight to the hotel on the one way street. They only have 4 spaces in front of hotel or parking at a lot one block down. We arrived around 1 pm and all the spaces were empty. (We only had to park in the $10 lot one day). Check in was fast and courteous. No problems. Had a room on 2nd floor and perfect size for two people. Nice little refrig. for stowing leftovers and pop purchased at Walgreens right around the corner. Simple breakdown. Hotel was very good price and great location. Only 4 free parking spaces and usually filled up by 5 pm. $10 daily parking one block away if you show ticket to front desk. Walgreens one block away to meet all essentials. Beach two blocks away and very nice with good waves. Good choice of restaurants within walking distance. Recommend Via Appia for italian and Piu Bella for a great selection of sandwiches. Plenty of police around and never felt worried about safety. If you look for change on the ground, you will be happy, we found two dollar bills, about 30 pennies, a nickel, about 5 dimes and a sterling silver ring. Its always good to be aware of your surroundings. Adds to the adventure of life and helps the pocket book. Buses are hit and miss. I'd recommend a taxi for old San Juan or short drive with rental car but make sure you park in free spot. Not well marked and saw alot of tickets. $75 dollar ticket. (Gas was .70 a liter) breakfast included and had meat, bread, pastry, oatmeal, cereal, juice, yogurt and some other things. Perfect filler before heading out on day trips. Pool is small but clean. Hot tub has alot of jets. Plenty of nooks to read books in or chat. Chaise lounges on 3rd floor for sunning. Room was cleaned around 2:30 pm. Front desk always glad to help.

The hotel is okay from the outside and located in a nice, mostly residential neighborhood. It truly is one block from a very pretty beach, and is close to a lot of the restaurants and bars, along with casinos/ATM's/Internet cafes, etc in Condado. It is a $12.00 cab ride to Old San Juan, or there is rumored to be a trolley and buses, but we saw no trolleys (ever) and only a few buses. We found the taxis, though more expensive, to be much more convenient. Their rates are set in the tourist zones of Condado, OSJ, Isla Verde, etc. The rate to the airport is $17.00. Regarding the hotel, we were surprised to see how small everything was. The pictures made it look bigger and from the reviews I read, I didn't recall reading this. Rooms: Our room was the smallest room I had ever stayed in by far. We saw other rooms on the first floor while the maids were cleaning and all were very small. We stayed in Room 6. We paid $153 a night with taxes and other fees. I judged that it was about 11'x12', plus a VERY small bathroom. The jacuzzi tub is a bathtub, only large enough for one person, with a couple of jets. We had one queen bed, a desk, and a minibar in the room. No storage for suitcases, very little room to hang or store clothes. There was one piece of nice art and that is the best thing I can say about the room. The bed was average and the linens were scratchy. By far the worst thing about the room was that it was terribly loud. It is located, along with several other rooms, right off the pool, the breakfast area, and the area where the maids park their cleaning supply cart for the entire morning. If you plan on sleeping past 6:30 in the morning at this hotel, don't stay there, or ask for a quieter room on the second or third floor. The first two mornings we were awakened by plates in the breakfast area, and then by our upstairs 'neighbors' sliding around chairs and walking around in high heels. Very frustrating. Keep in mind this is a small hotel and you are literally paying for a bedroom, not an actual hotel room. The living areas are nice, and they apparently expect you to your time in them or outside the hotel. Service: Housekeeping does a very nice job. Everyone at the hotel was very friendly and helpful. Check-in was easy. Living Areas: There is a lovely patio off of the reception area and some of the rooms. The pool and breakfast area are off the back side of the patio. The pool is extremely small, has four chairs, and is surrounded by barbed walls. It's not overly usable, but will keep you cool. On the third floor there is a nice kitchen w/ frig, microwave, etc that can be used by guest, a pool table, dining table, and an outside patio with a table/chairs and hot tub. Dining/Drinks: There is a minifridge in the room with beer/wine/soda. The prices are very reasonable, although we never used it. The breakfast is from 7:00-10:00 I believe, and is yogurt, fruit, ceral, lunchmeat, croissants, coffee, and orange juice. There are several restaurants around the hotel that are average. Overall our impression of the restaurants in San Juan was not good. We had the worst meal I've ever had anywhere at Mofongos, down along the water at the cruise piers in Old San Juan. We paid $70 for two of the worst meals I've ever seen and my husband was very sick that night after dinner. Excursions: We rented a car from Avis, just down the street, for $55 a day including insurance and drove ourselves out to see the Camuy Caves (note they are not open on Monday or Tuesday). The caves are absolutely amazing and shouldn't be missed! It is $12.00 pp to get in and $3.00 to park. Plan on waiting unless all trolleys are up and running (unlikely). The Marriott offers this same tour for $120 a person, or there are independent companies that charge $60-$70pp. We also saw the Oricebo Observatory and Museum. Definitely worth it also, but might be very difficult for those who are \"out of shape\" or handicapped....it's 500+ steps to get up to the museum and overlook. I believe it was $5.00 per person to get into the museum. Overall, the hotel is really just average. If you plan on being up very early and don't mind SMALL spaces, the hotel might be okay for you. If I were to go back, I would choose the Hotel Milano in Old San Juan (it's cheaper and in a better location, not to mention nicer) or one of the hotels on the beach in Condado and pay the difference.

They have little outdoor sitting areas spread around the building. If you are traveling with small children we highly recommend getting a room that is off of one of these courtyards. We put the kids to bed and were able to sit outside in the courtyard until we tired. Having checked in and out twice we can attest to the fact that the rooms aren't all the same size. Some are quite small and others are quite comfortable... I think it is the luck of the draw. We recommend room 25. Someone else mentioned it and we heartily agree... breakfast needs some protein... boiled eggs or peanut butter or something else simple. The kids were hungry not too soon after we ate. The Cafe Del Angel around the corner is lovely for authentic Puerto Rican food and very casual. Ramiro's is across the street a ways and truly unbelievable for fine dining - expect to pay a lot for a dinner there but you will not be disappointed. The desk staff were subdued but polite... no complaints there. One thing - if you are renting a car at the airport and driving in to the hotel, be prepared... Magdalena Street is small and off the main road it was, initially, almost impossible to find. We finally had to follow a sweet lady in her car to the hotel.

Being a manager in a 4-Star Renaissance hotel in the Caribbean, I can say that I know where I'm talking about: The hotel has a small reception, with staff that is helpful, and are willing to do an extra step for you. The 25 rooms are among 3 floors, of which the topfloor is the nicest, with the biggest rooms(suites), some sort of living room(nicely maintained), a pooltable, and a outside area with loungchairs and a jacuzzi. On the ground floor, where our room was located, the place is full of plants, (maybe even too full), which gives a very comfortable cozy atmosphere. Breakfast happens there, on nicely maintained furniture. The room we were in was Nr.10, which is actually a room for disabled, so we had no jacuzzi but a shower, which worked out OK. The hotel was full, so there was no choice as to stay in that room. The rooms have a fridge, microwave, a TV, a good airco-unit, but no cutlery in the drawers under the microwave... The fridge was filled with some beverages , which were very cheap ($1,- for Soda, $2,- for beer). The turndown service was up to 4/5 star standard, with daily refreshment of towels, etc... Moreover, which is in my opinion the most important, the place was clean and well maintained, both inside as outside the rooms! The breakfast, which is included, consists daily(!) of: OJ, Coffee, Milk, Flakes, Croissants, 3 kinds of pastries, ham/cheese, yoghurts, marmelade, bananas. Good enough to start your day with. But for a week stay it would be a little boring. The one little difficulty is parking, with only four spots in front of the hotel. My Puerto Rican friend had to park her car everytime on parking lot Magdalena, which is one block away, and is $10,65 for 24 hours. That's the best deal you can get closeby, or you might wanna choose to go and find yourself a spot in the nearby streets.

The staff was very friendly and helpful. Honestly, when you walk around the place, for the money it's really nice. Outdoor plant-lined walkways lead to rooms.

There is a pool on the second floor, and there is a jacuzzi on the roof overlooking the city. The guy at the desk told us this was supposed to be a luxury condo at one point, but the owner decided to make it a hotel. This is why the inside looks like an upscale condo.

It is located on Calle Magdalena, which runs parallel to the main avenue, Calle Ashford. It's therefore close to all of the restaurants, bars, clubs, etc., but still quiet. There are about four to six parking spots available in front of the hotel, depending on how well the cars are squeezed together. There is street parking on side streets if you are up for looking, but you'll do yourself a favor by having a compact car. Parking rules in the area are marked, though sparingly, and since many people park illegally, you can't pick spots based on where others have parked. The hotel entrance is controlled by an electronic latch, so you must buzz in to enter. The front desk is staffed 24 hours, giving additional security. The staff was incredibly helpful and spoke both English and Spanish fluently. Hotel rooms are arranged around a small courtyard. We stayed in a \"Corporate Executive Queen\". There was also a night table, dresser, TV, armoire, small fridge, microwave, and kitchenette sink. The bathroom also had a bath tub with jets. There was an internet router with a wired connection available, though we did not use it. The air conditioner and fan were powerful enough to get it cold (actually chilly). The continental breakfast was great, with yogurt, cinnamon and apple loaves, hamm, cheese, croissants, tea, and of course coffee. There is also a small in-ground pool on the property, though it could get crowded fairly quickly. The in-room fridge is stocked with water and soda for $1 each and beer for $2 each, which is only slightly more expensive than the same items at the Walgreen's right around the corner, but much cheaper than buying from vendors on the beach. The hotel is located in the Condado/Santurce area of San Juan, close to many restaurants and amenities. The beach is also only five minutes by foot, though we walked east a bit to find a less rocky portion. As another reviewer mentioned, the taxes add quite a bit to the published rate, but this is a result of local laws, not the hotel or the booking agency. On the whole, we had a good time at the hotel, and it served as a relaxing place to come back to every night.

Having read all the raves on Tripadvisor prior to our arrival, however, I was slightly disappointed by the hotel. Our room was small (about 12x12). With a queen size bed, a desk and a TV cabinet, it felt crammed. I looked at two other rooms - one about the same size as ours with a queen size bed, and another that's bigger with a king size bed, for $20 more. I was told that all the rooms with queen beds are small. Since we were only staying for one night, we decided to keep our room. There was an unclean feel to the room that I couldn't quite place. Perhaps it was the heavy grain marble floor, or the dullness of it. For a new hotel, the furnishing was unexpectedly worn: the headboard rattled with the slightest movement in bed, and the paint on the desk was worn to bare wood in a few places. Perhaps what got to me the most was the dubious little black balls of lint/dirt in the bedsheet. We paid $130 with tax for one night. For longer stays, I recommend paying extra for a bigger room. However, for the same price, you could do better with some of the B&B's or vacation rentals in the Condado/Ocean Park/Isla Verde area.

It was our last day and we wanted to go for one last dip in the sea after we had checked out but could not do so since they did not have this amenity. Typically hotels near beaches have this facility, so were a bit surprised. Secondly, parking is impossible to find, so the hotel will direct you to a private parking lot service up the street where you have to pay ten dollars to park per day. The money was not an issue, but unloading and loading the suitcases before moving the cars was (two cars and six girls - a lot of luggage!). And lastly, we were given a printed confirmation before we even got there that our check-out time was at noon. We planned our day accordingly only to be told at the last minute that we had to check out at eleven, which led to an unpleasant argument with the front-desk staff and a scramble to collect our things after breakfast.

My wife had suffered a sprained ankle prior to arriving in San Juan and during our first morning at the Coral Princess Inn, the front desk called and wanted to know if they could run out and get us anything that we needed especially \"room service\".(there is no restaurant at the hotel) In addition, I came down with a sinus infection that same day which caused me great discomfort. Not only did they consider this important but they recommended that I go to the hospital emergency room, called us a cab, and promised to hold our checkout procedure as long as possible. As it turned out, we were back before 11:00 am and in time for our regular departure. And finally, I had bought some beer that I was unable take on the cruise with me but they were kind enough to hold it until my return in one week. It sure tasted good as we waited for our room to be ready on March 6th. Without question, this hotel ranks as the best hotel we have ever stayed at in our many excursions because of their continued effort to put customer service ahead of anything else. San Juan is home to many cruise ships, so book early and stay late--You will not be disappointed.", "Date": "March 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cA Good Choice in San Juan\u201d", "Author": "Vancouver reviewer", "ReviewID": "UR3242512", "Content": "My husband and I stayed in this hotel for two nights in early December 2004.

It's not a luxury hotel, but it is lovely, with more of the feel of a guesthouse than a hotel. The rooms and public areas are classy - nicely decorated rooms and outdoor public areas with beautiful ceramic tile and lush greenery. Everybody there we came in contact with was friendly and helpful when required, most especially the manager, who gave us advice and then asked follow-up questions to find out how it went. We stayed in the handicap room because it was the only one available with a kitchenette, which we needed because we had to bring our own food for lunch and dinner. It, as well as the room, is small, but we managed OK. There was sometimes a musty smell in the room, which dissipated when we turned up the air conditioner, and the hot water took a very long time to heat up (but once it did it was fine). The bathroom has the feel of a commercial bathroom, which I didn't like because it wasn't pretty, but logically it's appropriate for the room. The upside was that the room is right on the ground floor with the beautiful outdoor courtyard and breakfast area right outside. This was great because even though there is a small table in the room that we could have eaten at, instead we were easily able to take our food right outside and eat at the tables set up for the breakfast. The continental breakfast they served was fine. The neighborhood is great. There are a lot of things for tourists, but it is also somewhat residential and not tacky at all. It also felt very safe. The Walgreen's around the corner was great to have, because it is open 24 hrs. and sold just about everything you could imagine except fresh fruit, which I found in a grocery story down Ashford Ave. The beach is very close by, and is the same beach that the Marriot Hotel opens onto. It is very clean and beautiful, and you could rent lounge chairs right there for $3.00/day. We rented a car and it was very easy to get to the highway from the hotel. The parking was not a problem - in addition to the 4 hotel spots and the backup parking for $10 down the block, there was street parking, which we were able to find right across the street. I would definitely recommend Puerto Rico, the Condado neighborhood, and the Coral Princess.", "Date": "February 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, MO", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for the price\u201d", "Author": "WebBrown", "ReviewID": "UR3213648", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at this hotel for one night before a cruise of Feb. 11, 2005.

Also, we highly recommend taking the rainforest tour. We toured with Sunshine Tours. The guide's name was Rupert. He was very knowledgeable, a gentleman and a great conversationalist.

We recommend Cieto Lindo, a very yummy & affordable Mexican restaurant just a block from the hotel on Magdalena. Be careful driving in Puerto Rico. The road signs are horrible and the drivers are worse. There are no rules in Puerto Rico!!! I recommend you buy a good road map at a book store, prior to your trip, if you plan on doing any driving.

Overall the Inn is great - 9 out of 10. Key facts are: it's spotlessly clean everywhere. With no exceptions, the staff are incredibly nice, friendly and helpful. The place has a funky feel as it has pretty minimal decoration plus some interesting modern art by a local artist (they have her contact details at reception if you want to buy). Everything you need is very local - the local store is the Walgreens half a block away and the beach is 2 blocks away. The Inn serves a cold breakfast that is ok. Drawbacks for the new visitor: The rooms are on the small side but we were hardly there so that was fine with us. All we wanted was a clean, well air conned room with a shower that worked. Which is what you get. There is no pool. (The spa on the roof is ok but the let the whole of the top floor, incuding the spa, on day 3 and so it was out of bounds from then on). We went in December for 6 days. 3 of those days were wet with heavy rain for the majority of the time. The good news is that San Juan has enough to do for when it is rainy (unlike some other Caribbean islands). Also, the other three days were beautiful with strong sunshine and temps in 80s. The beach by the Inn is not your typical Caribbean ideal beach. It on the windward side of the island so this means you get a small bit of sand, a steep drop off, lots and lots of wind and big waves. We loved the waves (they actually made the holiday for us) but if you want tranquil, blue and 'all you can hear is waves gently washing the beach' silence go elsewhere or treck to other parts of the island. Gay-wise, the area is cool with gays but the club is 10 mins taxi ride and the (large) gay bar near the Inn (4 blocks away) was dead day and night. December is not obviously not peak gay season!
