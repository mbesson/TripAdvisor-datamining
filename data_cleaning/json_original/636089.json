{"Reviews": [{"Content": "great people We didn't care for the the hotel we booked (it was beautiful but creepy) and moved to another, then we found Sari and wished we had stayed there from the start. It is family owned and the family is so very gracious. It is a bit secluded and has a great vibe. We enjoyed great food and great spa treatments (just massage, sauna and whirlpool). It was here that we made good friends with locals and visitors. Our trip to Bali wouldn't have been nearly as meaningful had we not stumbled upon this welcoming place.", "Date": "Jun 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR542904836", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "audigraph"}, {"Content": "Ubud Sari Resort _ would not recommend! We've stayed at this resort because their website was nice and the massage seemed to be good with healthy restaurant. Turned out to be the restaurant was nothing but a small coffee shop kind, not enough menu to choose from, so we stayed outside to eat, but most of all, one of the worst massages we've ever had. The therapist was not concentrating what she does, spa facility looked filthy, mildewy, the massage bed was not quite massage bed, having hard time to breathe while on the bed. The towel didn't smell fresh. The decoration was very tacky, waterfall sound was too much, impossible to sleep, emailing this hotel usually returns after 4, 5 days, front desk people are not communicating each other well, the price of stay was different depends on who is in charge at the front desk. The room smelled also mildewy, takes long time to have hot water, water leaks, roaches, rats, frogs. Nice zen style outside but once you stay there, you do not want to go back.Their breakfast has just two choices, yeah, just two....I felt sorry for average workers who are working so hard. Simply put, the management has a big flaw. This facility could be really nice if the owner finds the right person to run this resort, obviously need big upgrade for SPA facility. We don't want to go in a tub where you see somebody else's hair, just one vynal curtain to separate and someone else is in another tub. (they don't separate men and women!) We both went to various kind of massage salon in Ubud, half price than Ubud Sari and better massage, clean facility.", "Date": "May 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR297481452", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Susan_brit"}, {"Content": "I came back a different person!

The massage rooms were pretty bare. The bathtub for the flower bath was really old and there was mildew.

We were offered free massages to compensate for the mistake and when we went to see them a few days later they had family villa free due to a cancellation. We decided to cancel the nights we had booked at Puri Saraswati and take the villa at a, slightly, reduced rate. The villa was nice enough (no hot water though) but the resort grounds looked like they hadn't been well tended for a while and we had big brown stains on the top of our mosquito net. On our first night we heard a noise in our bedroom and whenever we switched on the, dim, lights we couldn't find out where it was coming from. In the morning we found a plastic bag had moved to the other side of the room and the only item of clothing that was left out (my fav bikini bought just for the honeymoon) had holes right through it. The noises continued throughout the night. The reception staff thought it might be a cat. On the second night we were out on the porch and saw 2 large mice/medium rats running along the beams - they had came out of our room. After another disturbed sleep we got up first thing and told a passing employee but that night when we returned nothing had been done so we asked reception to please block any holes while we went out for dinner. When we got back late we found that all they did was set a trap with coconut in it and when we looked for further traps we found that the stain on the top of the mozzie net was caused by it being covered in droppings. Another disturbed night where the mice decided to keep climbing on top of the bed and down behind our heads. We waited to see if they were going to block the holes (I really didn't want to have to move hotel again and had convinced my husband to stay) and asked about it at reception that night only for the man at reception to say that it was a common problem for a villa with a thatched roof that is in the jungle. His attitude clearly implied that we were being fussy to not want mice in the room. At that point I got annoyed and said that when you stay at a place that has 'health resort' as part of it's name you do not expect mice running around in your room all night and droppings all over your bed.We went for our massage only to find the steam room was mouldy, the sauna is tiny (fits 3 at most) and that the cold whirlpool is dangerous to step into. The showers also have half size doors so the attendants can stand watching you take your shower after your treatment and anyone who enters can see you in the buff.I have stayed in many places and this is without a doubt the worst.", "Date": "Aug 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR515281316", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Willow1212"}, {"Content": "great massage, awfull colonics Sari health resortGreat massages, pedicure, awful colonics.Cottages on the waterfall side seemed what cramped, hot water wasn\u9225\u6a9b working and the ceiling was decorated with damp marks the view from the tiny balcony was beautiful but the sounds from the invisible waterfall kept you up most of the night unless you have good earplugs, you better book a cheaper room with no waterfall view, because its noisy and you cant see it.The massages and the pedicure were great. Pedicure was done lying in a lazy chair looking out over the green jungle and was well done. The massage was also super, however I received a colonic twice with no effect, and it was very uncomfortable. Next time I would not try to safe money but do it in a western country. In addition, the steam room and the sauna were no big deal.It was a very quite place, friendly staff, but not that super as it seems on the web.

It's located in Jl Kajeng, a short walk from the main street, in a friendly neighbourhood with some excellent warungs (Balinese cafes serving local food at very cheap prices).Unless you're taking a 'cure' there's probably not much difference between staying at Ubud Sari and some of the other air-conditioned bungalow accommodations available in the area, but we found the location, accommodation and staff all very agreeable. We also enjoyed being able to do yoga onsite every morning and for much less cost than classes offered at places like Bali Spirit.The only problem we had was booking (and confirming) a twin share room and then being given a double. There was some talk of us moving rooms four times during out week-long stay (which would have included a stint in an un-airconditioned room), but that was quickly sorted out once we put our collective foot down and we had no other issues with the place.", "Date": "Dec 21, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR511210206", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "gingerau"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d636089-r16719084-Ubud_Sari_Health_Resort-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "636089", "Price": "$70"}}
