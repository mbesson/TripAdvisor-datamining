Our junior suite was unquestionably comfortable and spacious and we lived very happily there for two days. The public areas are splendid and although the hotel has been open for some time, the styling is still on trend and even ahead of the pack for Montreal. All good so far. BUT since we checked into the hotel for Christmas, it would have been handy if their website had indicated that they were planning to be rather 'out to lunch' service-wise for the holiday period. We had to hunt for someone to attend us at check-in as the reception was totally unattended. Later, when coming downstairs, we encountered members of the staff sitting around in the foyer scratching lottery quick pick tickets. Don't think I'm Scrooge, but standards ought to be maintained. It was all a little like that for the two days we were there. Be warned too that the hotel only runs partial room service: breakfast till 11.30 (and those folks WERE efficient), then nothing until 6.30pm when you can order room service dinner from Vauvert, a restaurant within (but operated separately from) the hotel. That food is GOOD. Too bad, however, if you want lunch. When I queried this hiatus with desk staff, they informed me that it was a small hotel (uplifted hand gesture), but at 100 plus rooms that is sufficient for full service. It's not a motel in Trois Rivieres. In the end, if you wanted full service, you might be better a few hundred metres along Rue St Paul at the Nelligan. If you want style and spaciousness and can forgive the lack-of-being-in-the-global-service-industry, then you can stay here.

I liked that our room was trendy, but also not packed with too many things - which allows room for our luggage. My husband went to the hotel breakfast one morning and it was approx $16.

I found it OK and can only describe it my not meshing with the whole feel of the place. The decor was minimalist chic and I'm generally OK with that. For example I generally enjoy the Aloft by Trudeau airport. Perhaps it's a series of disappointments that have predisposed me negatively. These are, a lack of parking other than valet, unexpectedly having to pay for Internet access and not having breakfast included. The last two could be my own fault but were a negative surprise nonetheless. Otherwise, as many other reviewers have mentioned the decor is minimalist chic with some funky elements like the slanted floor mirror and the fuzzy White chair. The chocolate in the room is a nice touch, and the pillar in the room makes it distictive. All the appointments to the room seem fine, it was actually nice to see that there's an umbrella hanging in the closest (behind the tinsy winsy ironing board). The toiletries are fine but their presentation seems somewhat ostentatious/affected being covered by a clear acrylic box. I never did figure out what to do with the box besides set it somewhere out of the way. It was nice having a robe to use in the room and it's cute the way they arrange two robes in the bathroom. One bathroom bugaboo, there doesn't seem to be anyplace to hang hand towels. The desk is waaay too small. It's more reminiscent of a shelf than a desk. I put the phone on the floor to make room for a mouse pad. And there's the annoying crawling under to get to a power outlet thing. Also, it's always annoying having to pay extra for Internet access. There's a flat screen TV but, as usual, only analog cable. I don't remember if there was a fitness center or a business center, can't remember signage and certainly didn't go looking for it. I never did get a chance to to enjoy the part of town that the Hotel is in, perhaps that would have improved my overall mood.

The bathtub was fantastic and the bathrobes were great to curlup in afterward. After a long day walking and biking it was a dream to come back to the hotel and soak for an hour before heading out again for dinner and entertainment. The bed was very comfortable. I agree with other reviews about the decor--the halls are dark and the furniture in the room isn't comfortable except to sit on and tie your shoes. Boutique Chocolates arrived with turn-down service--a nice treat. But we didn't come to Montreal to sit in our room. It was comfortable, clean and safe--my top priorities. The lobby bar really gets going on the weekend with a great dj and we had so much fun dancing until early hours. So nice to just go upstairs after a 'night out' and not worry about getting a cab or finding our way back to hotel! We didn't try the hotel breakfast as there were other options nearby. We would definitely stay at the St.Paul again---it is just around the corner from old town and easy walking distance to the sights. About getting around: Cab it to/from airport. Around town if it's rainy the subway is great --we got a 3day pass, or if the weather is good use BIXI BIKES. You can rent a bike for $5/day and go wherever you want to go. We never had a problem locating a station to pick up a bike and it's so much easier, cheaper, healthier, fun to see the city from a bicycle.

Once in our hotel room we found it to be very lovely! Once again it was very trendy and had very high ceilings with a large window that overlooked another part of Old Montreal.

I patiently waited for the waitress to approach me, or even acknowledge me for that matter, but she continued to chat away with what appeared to be locals.

The location was really great as the hotel is within walking distance to all of the bars, restaurants, and art galleries in Old Montreal. The hotel isn't in the middle of Old Montreal, but its very close to all that it has to offer. Amenities: The continental breakfast that's offered with the room was pleasant, included eggs, and several different types of bread/croissants, cereals, juices and coffee. We were also offered complimentary valet parking during our stay, which was a nice perk. We had to inquire about this deal though (we saw it on their website), it wasn't readily offered during our inquiry of hotel availability with the front desk staff. Valet staff and front desk personnel were extremely friendly. Guest Room: The guest room has a lot of closet space with room to place our things and a minibar stacked with lots of snacks and alcohol. Our bathroom was big, though the sink was very shallow and didn't properly drain. The bed itself wasn't entirely comfortable, but OK. As a person who likes a lot of pillows and nice linens, I wasn't all that satisfied with the bed. But, we had a decent night's sleep. Free internet worked well in the guest room. TV had lots of stations- both American and Canadian. The decoration throughout the hotel is very modern, but we found the decoration in the guests rooms to be a little bit jarring (though we recognize this is just our aesthetics). There is extremely low lighting in the elevators and the hallways, again, this is an effort to be modern, but its a bit much. One downside during our stay (over a weekend) is that the hotel turns into a nightclub on the first floor on the weekends, so the lobby was full of party-goers late at night. You could hear the music from the nightclub through the elevator, so that might be an issue for those staying on the lower floors (we were on a higher floor). Its also kind of annoying to have to push through people standing in line waiting to get into the club to get into the hotel later in the evening. Overall, the St. Paul is a good hotel, we might consider going back, but would be more interested in a cozier room. We would definitely recommend to travelers who like modern-looking, posh hotels and of course, to those interested in easy access to Old Montreal.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cHistoric St. Paul\u201d", "Author": "rjrstark", "ReviewID": "UR90329758", "Content": "A good walking distance to anywhere old downtown.

From the moment we arrived at the front doors we were staggered by how beautiful the building was. Built in 1906 and maintaining all the outward appearance and detail of that age, it is a breathtaking appearance. Inside we were greeted warmly by staff who spoke flawlessly in English or French, and offered immediate and pleasant assistance. The interior design was almost as impressive as the exterior, painting a stark contrast of modern design with the classic outward appearance of the building. The room (ours was a Superior Queen, most are) was generously sized with large bright windows, and the room was ready with classical music playing softly in the background. So you're wondering, what's the bad part? Well, the bed and pillows in our room were entirely uncomfortable. Neither myself or my wife were able to get a decent night's sleep on the bed as it was hard as a rock, and the pillows were similarly made of what seemed to be R40 insulation. It's difficult to down-rate such a beautiful place, perhaps it was just 'our' room - it was after all an 'ice' theme. Each floor has a theme incorporating elements of the Earth, so some floors are 'ice' that feature blue lighting outside the rooms and the interior d\u00c3\u00a9cor is inspired by light glassy surfaces and cool colours. There are also 'fire' rooms, and I believe there might be Earth too. The included continental breakfast was delicious, offering 5 types of fresh bread, 4 types of fresh fruit (Cantaloupe, Watermelon, Honeydew and Pineapple), fresh or packaged yogurt, a selection of croissants or chocolate-chip danishes, and 3 types of delicious cheese. The St.Paul is also in an excellent location relative to old downtown Montreal, close to lots of good restaurants and attractions. We ate near the hotel most evenings (Indian place around the corner is brilliant, as is Holder), and took the metro up to the Jean Talon market. Staff was very friendly, accommodating all of our requests effortlessly for maps and information. One thing, because its an old building the rooms seem to have an older drainage system - the bathroom has an open drain in the center. Part way through our stay our room started to smell like sewer. My wife has apparently seen this before and just poured several litres of water down the drain and the smell disappeared, so no biggie. This is after all a classic building - if you want the style, you have to live with some of the drawbacks of older architecture. Aside from our uncomfortable bed the stay was awesome. Perhaps if we had complained like some travelers love to do we could have been moved or even 'promoted' to a better room. We have traveled many times staying in just hostels so we weren't about to criticize and just made do. If you do have problems with the comfort of the bed I'm sure the staff would happily change your room, so overall I'd give the St.Paul a great review.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cnice without blowing my sock\u201d", "Author": "kissycanada", "ReviewID": "UR87331668", "Content": "Well the facade was amazing and with the positioning on night time spotlights, the building looked very impressive especially when it got dark.

Location is excellent on the corner of the of the main and prestigious streets McGill and St. Paul and around the hotel and within the hotel itself there is a nice balance between being trendy and an exclusive location with lots happening at the hotel's restaurant VauVert and on the other hand quiet and private enough to enjoy one's self and to get away from it all.

We would return in a heartbeat. The hotel offered a wonderful location, friendly staff, and an appealing minimalist d\u00c3\u00a9cor enhanced with attention to detail that made for an atmosphere that was simultaneously chic and cozy. There was a bit of confusion regarding parking, as when we first arrived, the doorman indicated we could park in a lot around the corner if we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to use valet parking (we generally avoid valet parking so we can easily get items from our car or leave things there as needed). When we checked in, we were told that this lot was for hourly self-parking only. My husband therefore brought the car back to the front of the hotel for the valet. Oddly, we later found that the valet service parks the cars in the same lot we had originally parked in! So if you need to access your valet-parked car, step out of the hotel, head right, and take your first right, and the lot is on the left (the front desk will arrange for a parking attendant to let you into your car if you only brought one key). The cost is $25 per night for the valet parking with taxes, and this covers 24 hours. Thus, we paid only $25 for our entire time in Montreal, even though we checked out of the hotel before noon but stayed in the city until about 3:00 pm. We booked a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153standard guest room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd through booking.com. Though the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website included no such room category, the description for this room type on booking was identical to that for a more costly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153superior queen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd option also offered on booking and directly through the hotel. We checked in around 4:00 with an incredibly friendly reception staff member and were assigned to room 701. The seventh floor was lit with red lights (a bit too reminiscent of Amsterdam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s RLD, to be honest!), but other floors we saw had a more attractive blue lighting. As others have said, the hallways and elevators are dark, but they were by no means dreary. Our room was wonderful. It felt spacious and loft-like, with a large column creating architectural interest and depth. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m including photos rather than trying to describe the appearance. The bed was incredibly comfortable. The only complaint I had was that the pillows were of the synthetic down variety that clump up and become hard. Had we been staying another night, I would have inquired about the availability of other pillow types. Also, there was no alarm clock, so be sure to bring an alarm if you need one (although we never turned on the TV, which may have had something programmable). French music played on the dated shelf music system upon our arrival \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most people these days probably don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t carry cassettes (!) and CDs with them, and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see an aux-in outlet for an iPod/mp3 player. The in-room safe was very large and easily accommodated a netbook and numerous other items. The digital thermometer quickly adjusted the room temperature to suit my whims (great A/C when we arrived on a warm afternoon, plenty of heat when the night turned cold and rainy). We stayed on a Sunday night, a rainy one at that, so there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much going on in the city and we found ourselves back in our hotel room by about 10 pm. It was a perfect night for a bath in the giant soaking tub (that easily accommodates two). The hotel-provided shower gel worked perfectly as bubble bath, and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153calming\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd lotion lived up to its name. The hotel also provided bathrobes, shampoo, conditioner, multiple bars of soap, a shoeshine cloth, shower cap, q-tips, and cotton balls. Turndown service included delicious handmade chocolates sealed with a wax stamp, accompanied by a note regarding the weather forecast for the following day. Although the activity in the lobby when we came through at 10 pm suggested there was some kind of event going on (not sure if it was at the hotel or if a group was staying there and going out elsewhere), we did not hear any noise in our room. There were newspapers outside nearly all of our neighbors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 doors in the morning, so there were definitely other guests on our floor. We ate the included continental breakfast on the second floor in what appeared to be part of a conference/event space. The items were standard (yogurt, fruit, cereal, bread, and pastries along with coffee and a couple of fruit juices) but tasty. The breakfast room was a pleasant space with lots of natural light and a mix of tables and lounge couches. It was rather busy but not crowded. In terms of location, we liked being near the edge of Old Montreal for easy access on foot to much of the city without being surrounded by the increasingly large tourist crowds found the further into the old city one ventured. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in town for long, but we were able to walk everywhere we went. Overall, I was struck by how the St. Paul managed to combine aesthetically-pleasing minimalist design with small details (e.g., soaking tubs, a lobby fireplace, friendly staff, and nicely-scented toiletries) that made our stay very cozy on a cold, rainy night.

Main purpose was to be able to relax after a long day. I'll break it down in a concise manner: The Good: The hotel is located in old Montreal, and is surrounded by trendy, upper-middle class oriented restaurants and cafes. The immediate area has a European charm to it, and makes for a nice getaway. The building the hotel is housed in, in itself, is a gorgeous early 20th century high rise. The interior has been expertly decorated and feels very modern. Room was clean and felt comfortable. Food in the restaurant is very good and priced reasonably well. The free high speed internet [wired] was also a nice touch. The Bad: Where does one begin? The staff is spotty, with a few great people surrounded by snooty and condescending individuals. On our last morning, on check-out, there was no one to even help with bags/door. I think it's safe to say that the hotel is understaffed. On top of this, we had the misfortune of having our vehicle broken into [not \"vandalized\" as the staff preferred to call it] while parked in the outdoor parking area. There was a mix up by the valet in not parking it in the more secure underground parking. When we were told of the incident, the staff were not helpful or in any way remorseful. On top of this, the mix up was handled terribly by the valet. I understand that parking lots in Montreal are a target for thieves, but if you're providing your customers with a valet service and treat a huge inconvenience such as ours with such tactless disinterest, it does not come off well. You are, after all, in the service industry. It is not a privilege for me to stay there. Rather, it is your privilege to have me stay there. Terrible experience. The hotel houses a very popular and trendy bar/restaurant and it seems that the regular Thursday night party runs well into the early morning. McGill street facing rooms will have to deal with a lot of noise. Maybe even the whole weekend is a write off with noise, I'm not sure as I didn't stay through it. Not a great thing to have to deal with if you're trying to get some rest. As previously mentioned, the beds are very hard and thus will be uncomfortable for a lot of people. The selection of toiletries is minimal, and considering what the room rates are like, this seems like a travesty. There weren't enough towels for the two us, and the turn down \"snack\" consisted of a single chocolate for two people. How considerate. FINALLY: St Paul is the perfect place for a party seeking, well off individual seeking the trendy confines of a stylishly heartless overpriced hotel. I would never again stay here, neither would I allow clients to book me there in the near future. I think a lot of work needs to be put into the training of the staff, to make sure that they know what customers need, expect and what respect is. If this was my business, I would slowly start firing a 1/3 of the staff and replace them with the kind of people who actually enjoy working at a hotel for a living. There is no need for such attitude. It's the little things that count, that give hotels it's charm and soul. As such, it is my unfortunate opinion that the Hotel St Paul lacks both, and will still need a lot of managerial work in order to get it to be the kind of place that I would like to stay at.

Just the old architecture around this place is amazing. The warm and fuzzy touches -- the arm-in-arm bathrobes, the chocolate on your pillow with the temperature forecast, the really nice toiletries -- all were icing on the cake. Other than the cold Canadian winter (my birthday is in November), I can't think of any negatives. We loved every restaurant (it is Montreal after all), all of which were in the neighborhood and many with live music.

Never mind that the halls are dark, the rooms are small and the beds are hard as rock, what made it impossible for me and my fiance to stay at this hotel was the fact that both the lobby and the rooms themselves reek of some kind of perfumed chemical! Upon checking in during the early afternoon, we both noticed an overpowering perfume odor emanating through the lobby. As I have traveled EXTENSIVELY for work and never before encountered a lobby that smelled like cheap car freshener, I assumed the offense was coming from a female guest who was checking in ahead of us. But, lo and behold, when we entered our room, we discovered that it was even worse! I'm not sure I can do justice to how overwhelming and sickeningly sweet the smell was, but my eyes immediately started watering, my throat constricted and my head started pounding. We called the front desk ASAP to explain that there was an overwhelming perfumey smell throughout our room. They sent up a porter who matter-of-factly explained that EACH TIME the rooms are cleaned, they are sprayed with something to make them \"smell good.\" He went on to say that he would try to find us an empty room that had not yet been made up for the day. About 20 minutes later, he returned to move us to a room down the hall. It appeared to be a downgrade as the lamp shade hung off the lamp (broken) and there was a large stain on the floor. The smell seemed like it might not be as strong, but I wasn't sure since I was actually having DIFFICULTY BREATHING by this point!! My fiance immediately opened the windows as far as they would go with the hopes of airing out the room and then he took me outside to get me some fresh air. After approximately 20 minutes of walking around, I was feeling better so we returned to the hotel, hopeful that the open windows would have done the trick. Well, upon re-entering our room, I was again assaulted by the overwhelming fumes of whatever it is they spray throughout their space. My headache came pounding back and I found myself nauseous from the smell. It wasn't that the scent itself stunk; it was that the chemicals were so strong that they were literally making me sick to my stomach. My fiance took one look at me, pale with watering eyes, and said, \"There is no way you can stay here. I'm having trouble breathing myself.\" So we went down to the front desk and explained our situation. We were told that the hotel would have been able to refund our money in full on the spot, but because we had \"made the mistake\" of booking through Travelocity, we would now have to contact them and have a cancellation form faxed over. Once they received the form from Travelocity, they assured us that they would be able to refund our money in full for the first night. They were, however, immediately able to refund our money for the following two nights. I will add that though the clerk at the front desk was forthcoming with this information, he was in no way friendly or apologetic about our situation. In fact, he was fairly rude. So there my fiance and I were in Old Montreal with all our luggage and nowhere to go, and with hoops to jump through in order to get a full refund. What a way to start a vacation. But the story doesn't end there. Once we were finally situated at another hotel (no easy feat to find an opening at the last moment), we contacted Travelocity so that they could fax the cancellation form to the Hotel St Paul. Travelocity said that they first needed to contact the hotel. When they did, the Hotel St Paul told them that if we had not wanted to stay in the hotel, we never should've checked in in the first place! WHAT?! What happened to \"just have them fax over a cancellation form so that we can refund your money\"? The Hotel St Paul then went on to say that we had been at the hotel for more than 4 hours and for those two reasons combined they were now refusing to refund our money. But it was a boldface lie, as we had not even been IN MONTREAL for 4 hours at that point! The bottom line is that the Hotel St Paul STOLE over $215 from us for a room we were not in for even 2 hours, they lied when they promised us a refund, they were rude to us, and I'm fairly sure they filled our room anyway, since it was very hard for us to find a vacancy elsewhere and there were others on the street looking as well. My question is: how dare the Hotel St Paul ADMIT to spraying chemicals throughout their rooms after I told them that I was having a reaction but then refuse to refund our money? We did not stay at their hotel for the simple reason that we COULD NOT physically stay at their hotel. Had we tried to continue to stay there, I very likely would've had to go to a doctor. As it was, it took hours of me resting in bed with a rag over my head to recover. I was sick from the fumes in that place! Sick! And WHY did the clerk at the front desk tell us that our money would be refunded if they never intended to refund our money? Honestly, I would advise anyone-- especially people who find themselves the least bit sensitive to chemicals-- to look elsewhere. This hotel is waaaay overrated, and the experience was the very worst hotel experience I've ever had, and I have stayed at a lot of hotels! As I said, the halls are dark, the rooms are nothing special, the beds are uncomfortable-- but it is the God-awful fumes permeating the air that will make you wish you'd never set foot in this place. I know there are a lot of positive reviews about this hotel, but I am begging you to heed the negative reviews. Several people have complained of being treated poorly by the staff, and I saw another review where the patrons were told that had they made their reservation through the front desk (via phone) as opposed to through the Hotel's website, they could've gotten a full refund. Excuses, excuses. What difference does it make if you book your reservation over the phone, through their website or through a travel website? If you have people who are so unhappy with what they're encountering, maybe the staff of Hotel St Paul should pay attention! At the very least, an apology with a refund is in order. Think twice, people. There are much better hotels out there.

We do like to stay in the smaller boutique hotels in old Montreal and have had some wonderful stays at some truly memorable hotels. As to our stay at the St Paul I will not be booking there again, for which there was only one reason. My reason for not staying in the hotel is that I am sure that we were given the worst room in the building and the worst room in this building is not good. The issue was that that the windows of this room look into a dark square surrounded on all sides by other buildings and fire escapes. The result is that the room is so dark that you must have the lights on at all times to be able to see, and if you want an idea of the weather you actually need to go downstairs to determine what to wear for the day because you actually cannot see any daylight at all from the windows of this room. I found this room to be so claustrophobic that I wanted to be out of there the minute that I woke up and unfortunately this coloured my whole experience at this hotel. I will say that staff in this hotel were pleasant and helpful and were happy to discuss the best places to see in the city and advise if they thought that some of our planned stops may not have been the best idea given our short stay in the area. In addition to this, their location is perfect if your plan is to wander around the city. It really was a shame because the room itself was perfectly fine, clean and as another reviewer commented the tub is to die for.

The rooms were a bit smaller than you'll find in major brand hotels, but I found them to be perfectly sufficient. There was a workspace between the bedroom and bathroom (which normally would be folded into a larger bedroom), and I liked the distinction between work and relaxation that it afforded.

I've been to a few smaller hotels before, Hotel Godin, and le Meridien but the sleeker modern feel of St Paul attracted me. The hotel is definitely the sleekest and most minimally gorgeous one in Montreal. The lobby is fantastic with the large fireplace and cute minibar at the front while the hallways are shrouded in a unique red glow that gives a real feel to the place. The room is similarly decorated with clean lines and a wonderful bedding and nice finishes, we had a great view of the city too from our window. The desk staff were a joy to deal with but the service needs some work for a hotel of this caliber. Check-in was great and the concierge service is certainly one of the better ones to get hard-to-find reservations and city know-how. A TV problem was attended to and fixed in just a few minutes. Very smooth and professional every time I spoke with the desk. But room service was below par, as one night the very small minibar counter hadn't been cleaned and another night the bathroom still had robes and towels on the floor! It didn't actually bother us that much and we were too busy to report it but compared to hotels even below this class the lack of basic room cleaning seemed very out of place with the hotel's projected class. Another more irritating issue was the iron had some sort of odd residue that I didn't notice that lead to it permanently staining one of my shirts. I called the front desk with the problem and the iron was replaced but otherwise nary an acknowledgment of the damage. The restaurant is truly wonderful and an exceptional deal for the prix-fixe lunch, I had one of the best salads there in my life. The continental breakfast is the expected buffet with a nice selection of fruit, cereals, pastries in a very nice dining area. In spite of the service guffaws I plan to stay there again and book a suite for the next trip (when business allows) - the great look and the always congenial (if not competent) service is enough to give it another shot.

I love the juxtaposition of combining modern interior design with older buildings, thus I adore the decor of St. Paul.

The situation with the other hotel was frustrating but the staff at St. Paul offered compassion and care. In the end I was more than pleased with the change in plans. In December I got stranded in the Montreal airport after midnight, unable to catch my connecting flight due to a storm. Not wanting to sleep in the airport, I called Hotel St. Paul and was thrilled that they had a room. My second experience there was just as good as the first, with helpful, understanding staff and a beautifully upkept room. The croissants at the breakfast lounge were delicious. The rooms are fresh and lofty. Clean-lined design is chic but not too cold. I particularly like the dark stained hard wood floors. The washrooms feature deep soaker tubs and beautiful marble and tile. If boutique style hotels are up your alley, then definitely consider staying at Hotel St. Paul.

The outside and the surrounding environs of St. Paul is lovely. However, what I noticed when I first got out of the cab was the enormous sewage excavation that was taking place around the entrance of the hotel. This was apparently to continue for the next couple of months. Thankfully, my room was high enough that I never heard any construction noises, but I imagine the floors closer to street level weren't so fortunate. Check-in was smooth and shortly after I got to my room, front desk called up to see if everything was all right. I asked for an extra robe, as the double occupancy room I had only seemed to have one. The clerk cheerfully told me she would send it up with someone from housekeeping. Neither housekeeping nor robe arrived. We ended up asking the cleaning staff for an extra robe the next morning. The room itself was small and oddly decorated with modern touches, mixed with particle board Ikea-esque furniture. The hotel was very, very dimly lit, which I can only guess was meant to add a \"modern\" look to the place. Breakfast consisted of cold pastries and cereal. The toiletries smelled vile and the soap felt like a rubber eraser and foamed up not at all. All of these issues are minor, but when added up, they didn't warrant the amount we were spending on our stay. But most of all, the service just wasn't what we expected. Upon check out, we noticed the the bill included a charge for the minibar. Since neither of us had even taken anything from the fridge, we contested it. Instead of apologising for the error and taking the $5 charge off, the clerk asked question after question. Were we sure that we didn't take the alcohol from the minibar? Was anyone else staying with us that could have possibly taken it? Had we had guests up to our room? Then she took out a large book that I guess contained records of everything that was ever restocked in every minibar in the hotel and proceeded to search for evidence. Basically calling us liars. Yes, folks, after spending five nights and over $1,200 at a hotel, we frequently like to get a little something back by taking a $5 bottle of bourbon and lying to the hotel. We remained as civil as possible and after 15 more minutes of more \"are you sure?\" questions from the clerk, she finally deigned to take the charge off.

I have never bothered with write-ups or comment cards but felt it was due when my wife could not stop talking about our experiences to our friends and family. Our first trip here almost 3 years ago was romantic and spontaneous. My wife and I organized a last minute weekend getaway to celebrate her birthday, which just so happened to be while the jazz festival was taking place. We arrived and were immediately impressed with the exterior of the hotel, the valet who greeted us, and the lobby of this magnificent hotel. Wow! Registration was quick and informative (offered a map and brief rundown of the surroundings, which helped alot.) The room was sleek in design, charming in ambience, yet simplistic and minimal, and very comfortable. The location was perfect with everything in walking distance. For our two evenings, we relied on suggestions from the concierge and were not dissappointed. We enjoyed two evenings of culinary gems, both ending with the outdoor festivities and pleasant walks back to the hotel. We found the concierge team both informative and very knowledgable. To complete a great weekend, the hotel suprised us with a small bottle of champagne and strawberries, with a card reading \"Happy Birthday\". Kudos to the hotel, for gestures like that go a long way! The one point I thought could be improved is the selection of the bed size. I enjoy the comfort of my king size bed, but it seems the hotel is equipped with queens only. My wife keeps reminding me that it is not so bad to sleep closer to each other for a couple of days...she's right! Our second visit was during May of last year, when we reserved 3 rooms as we convinced four of our closest friends to visit Montreal for the first time. We all decided to drive to Montreal and were all dumbfounded when we encountered a construction site directly in front of the hotel. Driving in the old town was horrific and terribly frustrating. We voiced our discontent and were politely upgraded so the noise would not damper our weekend. From that point after, our stay was just what we expected. Two days before our arrival, I had contacted the concierge (Michelle) who instantly sent me links to restaurants, wine bars, and lounges that she recommended. She then made all the reservations and also took the time to go out of her way and purchased wine and cheese so we could enjoy upon our arrival. Everything was perfect and our friends were impressed. All the staff never seize to amaze us with their desire to please. Our friends enjoyed the hotel very much and we are certain they will be back without us next time. For those interested, the restaurants we enjoyed were Joe Beef and Chez L'Epicier. Thank you Michelle. We also had the chance to visit Jean Talon Market, St-Joseph's Oratory, and Botanical Gardens. All are accessible by subway and were explained perfectly by the concierge team. Our most recent trip which was a week before Christmas and by far the best trip yet. For starters, no more construction! It looks fantastic, with a beautiful boardwalk running thru Old Montreal and leading towards the waterfront. Spectacular! Also, what we found comforting, is that the team of concierges, valets, and doormen are all the same as our first trip to this hotel. It is very much a family and somehow we now feel part of it. Both are details that make it a pleasure to return to Hotel St-Paul. Upon check-in, we met Steve again, the jovial young valet, who greeted us with an enormous smile. The time it took to complete our registration, our car was parked and luggages comfortably installed in our room. To our delight, we met Michelle and she instantly (knowing we are food fanatics) suggested le Club Chasse et Peche. Unable to book a reservation the first night, we enjoyed Bronte(French, Mediteranean gastronomy) and jazz bar afterwards ( Upstairs). A wonderful evening that we thought would be hard to beat. We were wrong! The following day began with shopping and ended with a carriage ride in the old city. We were dropped off in front of Chasse et Peche and what an experience it was! For anybody visiting Montreal: try and book a reservation here! It is well worth the price. On a closing note: If you planning a trip to Montreal...think strongly of staying at Hotel St-Paul...we are fans because of their class, sincerity, and true professionalism. In today's society, many hotels are similar but it is nice to have a hotel that has some real personality.

I did not hear one single complaint or criticism, and with an event of this magnitude & expectation level, that is high praise indeed.

First off, the staff is amazingly helpful The valet took care of our car immediately (which was great since we arrived after midnight). The front desk was very helpful offering suggestions on places to eat, places to site-see, and where to find ATM machines. When we were checking out, we wanted to have them hold onto our luggage while we went and grabbed brunch at a local restaurant. We didn't even have to make this request of them since the attendant behind the desk beat us to the punch and asked us if we'd like for the hotel to hold our luggage while we got something to eat (he even recommended a great little jazz joint around the corner from the hotel). The staff at the St.Paul was exceptional. As for the rooms...they are pretty modern and have a minimalist decor. Though I prefer classic, the rooms were indeed comfortable and clean. Loved the dark wood floors. There was a large flat panel television with all the stations you could want. The bathroom was stately and had a deep bathtub capable of comfortably fitting two people. There was also a nice work area off of the foot of the bed. It was great. To add that extra touch, they had a very modern cd player/radio that was softly playing classical music when we first entered the room. After having spent 5 hours on the road prior to arriving, it is extremely relaxing to walk into a clean comfortable room with soothing music playing in the background. I loved that added tocuh of comfort. The location is hard to beat. We were within easy walking distance of Old Port, the Old City, and China Town.
