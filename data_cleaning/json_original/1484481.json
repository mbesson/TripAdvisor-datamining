Hotel is pricy-for-value like most of the other hotels in Singapore. Hotel meets your expectations if you dare to venture to a more authentic surroundings in which local people work and eat, in this case in the outskirts of Little India. Rooms are small and very basic, and well, a bit out-of-date: ours smelled of cigarette smoke (our friends room didn't), but bed linens were clean. Staff is polite and can help you with normal touristy questions. Wifi signal was weak in our room. Breakfast gets you going with toast, some fruits and scrambled eggs, but for anything more you should really visit the hawker food court just across the street offering a great selection of Asian food around the clock, at a very affordable prices. Hotel location is a bit distant from the popular tourist attractions, but there's a bus stop beside hawker court with several buses taking you downtown. There are three MRT stations within walking distance but not very close: Farrer Park (through the mall) was maybe the closest, Boon Keng the easiest to travel to/from and Lavender an option if you prefer EW line.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cRoom for three people is too tiny\u201d", "Author": "I_am_a_passanger", "ReviewID": "UR121011983", "Content": "The room for three people we got was very small.

The location is not good, it is quite far from the MTR, about 3km. The breakfast is simple as the hotel, bread, butter, jam, coffee and banana, the products are good but you don't have many options. If you don't want to spend much money you can stay at Madras Eminence, but don't expect much from it. As I said the cost-benefit is very good, believe me.

Even the negative feedback about hotel was with the appreciation for staff. And when we checked in on early morning of 14th June 2011 it was all proved to be true. We arrived at 0730 in morning and our rooms were ready to our surprise. Even they offered breakfast for that day which we were not entitled at all so we availed the same. Extra pillows, blankets were no issue. Rooms were small but we only spent nights there so no problem. A complaint about Washroom was addressed immediately even it was around mid-night. The cute \"To To\" ( pet dog of one of the staff) soon became friend of my children. Breakfast was very limited and simple (Toast, Jam, Butter. one fruit and tea/coffee with stumbled egg), searls but what we could expect in this cost (199 SD for two inter-connected rooms with five Beds 2 washrooms)? We stayed six nights there and the staff helped us in transportation options very effectively. We used MRT, Taxi, Buses every means of transport. The girl at receptionist was so affectionate to my kids. one of my kids got a minor injury and the boy at reception (CHOA was his name I believe) immediately provided first Aid box and I managed the dressing followed by repeated dressing every day using the First Aid Box free of charge). Over all it was a pleasant experience and we will love to stay there again. PS. We also used their laundry machines for just S$ 8 (Wash and dry).", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore, India", "Title": "\u201cAverage hotel with basic facilties\u201d", "Author": "shrikanth_hegde", "ReviewID": "UR112354684", "Content": "We stayed for 6 nights in this Hotel and had no big issues.
