Since the hotel was converted 2 years ago from a Renaissance to a Sheraton, the common areas have received a great facelift and are very nice by Sheraton standard. The room is OK with a new carpet and updated furniture but the bathrooms are terrible having received no more than a coat of paint AT BEST. There is rust through the grout lines in the shower, layers of paint on an old door, archaic faucets and counter space, hair stuck to the ceiling etc... I had a big issue with no in room WIFI in 2012, no in room safe and no minibar/fridge. Regardless of whether or not the hotel is privately owned and only operating as a Sheraton, should there not be some sort of \"standard\" that all hotels under the banner must follow? I felt that I was terribly inconvenienced by the above. There is a pool at the hotel with enough of a chlorine smell to not go inside. My associate took the risk and had to wash his eyes after getting out with the emergency wash to alleviate the burning and dryness. Bottom line, the hotel is acceptable, but don't expect anything special near the airport.

Can't recall her name but when I asked to be upgraded she apologized but they were out of those rooms but she immediately comped my internet. I asked to have the room de-feathered and housekeeping was there within five minutes and did it with a smile. Fitness center is very nice - not the best I've ever seen, but all around very well outfitted and user-friendly. Didn't swim in the pool, but it is positively first rate. Heard some planes, but didn't keep me up at night. One thing to keep in mind is that for me it would have made more sense to stay at the airport Sheraton which is right across the street from the terminal and above the rental cars because that way I could have taken my car in the morning and saved on the $12.95 parking fee at this Sheraton which is only a few minutes away.

It's a bad thing because the hotel is in the flight path of all incoming planes to Toronto Airport, meaning that every single minute all day, HUGE airplanes pass really close over the hotel. If you have a room facing the direction of the planes like I did, this can be unnerving; I was worried I was going to die, lol. I do have to say though, that the insulation and sound-proofing is very good. I was on the 7th floor and I wasn't bothered by plane noise or traffic noise all night. The beds and pillows were really comfortable, and the rooms were cleaned very well. I found the food in the restaurant to be over-priced though ($17.00 for a burger and fries? Really??) and while there is a couple fast-food and sit-down restaurants close-by, the hotel is kind of off the beaten track as far as entertainment goes.

What really burned my cookies was the $5.95 charge for a freaking litre of bottled water. Who in their right mind wants to pay $5.95 for bottled water?

Surprisingly, inside we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear the planes landing about 1 a minute \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 even in the room, the only sound we heard was when the planes landed and reversed their engines to brake. But even that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t loud enough to cause you any loss of sleep or make you turn up the TV. It was quite amazing how soundproof it was compared to outside when we took our pooch for a walk (yes, the Renaissance is pet-friendly and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we chose it). The dog shook like it was a thunderstorm outside but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear it inside at all. There are grassy areas to walk your best friends.

It was a little underfurnished and could have used another sitting chair or loveseat (sofabed). The desk chair was broken (caster) and fabric worn. TV movies were $14 -- but an old CRT TV. The lobby and sitting areas were very nice and not like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d find in a motel. We got a special weekend room rate of $118 that included the $15 for parking, breakfast (buffet) for two, and a $100 bonus bucks Marriott certificate to be used on a 2 night stay at another Marriott. Seemed like a good deal to me. We had room service for dinner and ordered a 8oz hamburger that was just OK, a 10oz NY steak that was OK, and kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spaghetti for the dog who loved it. Was a little put off that the little mustard jar supplied had been half used, and made me feel uncomfortable about the cleanliness of the room service. The king bed was not a Revive bed that Marriott has made famous. It was very hard and had no featherbed topping to soften it. The 3 pillows were not feathers and also very hard.

I have no problem paying high rates in a central location but an airport hotel should have rates of $12 (or less) per day. Everything else about the hotel was great, and we were able to use the hotel's closeness to the 427 and 401 highways to visit tourist sites in Toronto during our stay. The drive to downtown Toronto takes about 20 minutes depending on the traffic. There is a restaurant and bar in the hotel but we only used the bar in the evening. The hotel bar is very nice with a modern design thoughout. Usually airport hotel bars are a real drag, but we had a great time!

I'm so glad I stopped staying at the Sheraton! The Renaissance is welcoming, well organized, friendly, helpful--and the food--buffet breakfast and tapas in the restaurant--is superb! Fresh, original, healthy, hot, delicious. The decor is relaxing and intriguing. The rooms are large, clean, well appointed--and restful. I was concerned about the hotel shuttle--whether that extra trip from the airport would be just too much after a long flight and with tons of luggage (5 suitcases)--but it is great. Easy enough. To date, hotel shuttle is very reliable and very regular. It is no extra burden than having to take the sky train or inner aiport terminal shuttle to the Sheraton Gateway in Terminal 3. And you get a much better experience when you arrive at the Renaissance--excellent and prompt check-in staff. And valets on check out actually know something about luggage and transport! No struggle or drama. A great Toronto hotel, not just a great airport hotel.", "Date": "February 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cWonderfull hotel!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5424006", "Content": "We were there for 3 nights and absolutely loved it! The staffs were very friendly and helpfull. This hotel has a modern decor, nice and bright. The room is quite roomy, lot of storage space. Our room and all public area were very well kept. We at first were concern with the air trafic but once you're in the room, it's not very noticeable. The only problem we had were coffe supplies were not replenish daily. We also asked for some extra bath towers but never get them. For that I give it a 4 instead of a 5 star rating.
