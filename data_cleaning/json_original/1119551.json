When we made the booking we asked the receptionist the cheapest way to the hotel from Heathrow by train, he advised us to take the Heathrow connect to Paddington. The hotel is just around the corner from paddington station, it is a lovely place opposite a small park. The room was spacious with high ceilings, clean with comfortable new beds. Although is a budget hotel it has 24 hours security and reception. The breakfast is ample continental with very tasty cornflakes to start, toasts, butter, marmalade, tea, coffee as much as we wanted of everything. That was really good as we didn't feel hungry until late afternoon. The staff are friendly and very helpful, when asked they told us where to buy good quality things the cheapest way - we really appreciated this. The location is excellent everything is within walking distance.

A friendly advise for all of you to please stay away from this failthy dump! Unfortunatly, due to a sudden change of plan as a result of this unforseen circumstances I had to stay in London for one night. After searching for a single room all over Central London I couldn't find a hotel that accept me for one night due to high season and because I guess it was a Saturday. I therefore was so tired and desperate that I ended up in this dump failthy hotel thinking that it would at least meet the minumum of my needs. Wrong! I was given a double room as this is the only room that they had and I had no problem for 59 Pounds. when I handed my credit card to the guy at the reception, he asked that around two pounds will be charged on my bill which I thought it was extreemly odd but I had no other choice. well he gave me the key and told me that my room was on the fourth floor. after climbing an infintive narrow scary stairs, I managed to find my room. when I opened the door I swear I wanted to cry. The carpet had stains all over, the room had a terrible smell that makes you want vomit. The sheets have holes and looked like some blood on them. the toilet is so dirty and unflush and smells really bad and full of smoke. I had to spray my cologn all over the room to endure the terrible smell and to run away from this room as soon as possible as this smell would probably inflict a terrible health hazards to me. after hours of exploring London I came really late to have few hours of sleep to check out from this nightmare. I had to sleep on my cloths and I woke up really early to run for my life. I took a quick shower in the weirdest toilet ever. Pay little extra and stay at the beautiful Rhodes hotel in the same area or the stylohotel. This is a big shame of this beautiful city to allow such establishment to operate which it depicts a terrible image of London. as a matter of a fact I've flown the world and stayed in different categories of hotels but I've never experienced such a terrible stay like the one I've witnessed with the Continental hotel so please for your health and safety avoid staying at this place even if you sleep in the street.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCheap & Cheerfull\u201d", "Author": "PRRox", "ReviewID": "UR95214929", "Content": "Ok , it's not super clean, its not super trendy, And its not the Ritz..

There is no chest board and the room is furnitured by an old TV, placed on an old broken piece of furniture, has bad reception and faulty action bottoms. The room heating is not working and the proprietor borrowed me an electrical heating fan. The bed is too small for tall people and the mattress is dangerous for people with a fragile back. There is a toilet and a tiny shower, with unfinished blank wood, all dirty, filthy and dangerously exposed with nails. I injured myself my first day, so be vaccinated against tetanus. Careful, nails are also on the old dirty carpets of the sleeping room, so never walk with bare feet. Anyway, you would not dare because it's too dirty. There is also a big hole on the floor of the WC with broken tiles where cold draft is coming blowing cold air continously into your room. Do not look at the curtains which haven't been washed since ages. The breakfast is joke: 4 half slices of cheap and chewing gum like toast, only 1 sort of jam, but you can choose between cheapish tea and worn out coffee. Eastern European staff, poorly dressed and clearly demotivated, serve the breakfeast. Continental Hotel in the Westend is the cheapest hotel in London I have been in, however the money is not worth its value. It's dirty, cold, with a permanent draft so that you easily risk to catch a cold. Even for one who has a tight budget, saving a few pounds for a dirty hole, risking your health by hurting yourself with rusty nails, eventually ending up with sepsis or a tough flu, is not worth the money you are saving. The whole standard of the hotel is unacceptable, below any level of acceptance with rooms comparable to a prison hole. In the poorest places of underdeveloped Bolivia, I had much better accommodation in small but clean rooms provided by poor locals than in posh London. Even in underdeveloped countries, the very existence of dirty holes like in the Continental Hotel in London would be closed down. A cheap pension in Spain offers at least impeccably clean rooms. I understood from an Irish visitor that Continental Hotel even advertised in Ireland. Do not be tricked into the low prices! The only positive thing I can say about this hotel is that the location is good. In spite of the cheap hotel fare (I payed 20 \u00c2\u00a3 for a night), it's neglected, dirty and overpriced. It's a shame for London to allow these hotels to operate. The local London authorities should seriously consider to regulate the hotel market for the upcoming Olympics and close down some of these so-called hotels like the Continental in Norfolk square for the sake of the international reputation of London and to improve the bad image investors have about this place. In all: this hotel was the greatest nightmare and the worst hotel in my life, just the rats were missing (probably I had the chance not to see them). There were no CCTV cameras, so there are also great security concerns if you leave anything like fancy clothes in your room. Anyone can ask for your key. There are no efforts at all to maintain this place and the filth and dirt is just disgusting, so never bring your wife or girl-friend into this place.

The black and red carpet had more black than when it was made, the inside of the toilet was brown, the toilet seat was broken and the counterpane was covered in stains from top to bottom. When I went downstairs to complain, I was told that I should have looked earlier and offered No 17, which was on the fourth floor, but the receptionist could or would not tell me whether it was any bigger. \"We've got 100 rooms. How do you expect me to know all of them!\" was the helpful reply. Luckily, my son had been given a triple, so I slept in their room that night - I didn't fancy climbing four flights of stairs to find another pigsty. I was given a ground floor room the next day (different receptionist), which was at least clean. Don't hold out too much hope for the continental breakfast. It is toast and marmalade and either tea or coffee. However, I must point out that the breakfast room and what I could see of the kitchen were spotless and the girls there very pleasant. By the way, I have given this place one mark, but only because the form did not allow me to put none! The only saving grace was the price, but even that did not make up for the room and lack of service. The place needs gutting.", "Date": "September 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salerno", "Title": "\u201cVery bad!

I had no idea about this hotel and accepted to check in there. The room and the furniture (bed, chairs) were old. The balcony looking to the garden was also dirty with the curtain nearly fell from the rail.The cleaner didn't clean the room or changed the towel everyday. The last day there was a drunk English teenager came to the dining room and bullied Asian customers while no staffs cared to stop him. I think it was run by the Chinese. The hotel should be inspected by the officials to improve the standard of living there. It's pity that tourists won't know only by looking from internet. It should be kicked out of business if they refuse to improve the condition.

But, if you pay by credit card they place a 4% handling charge on top of this. The first room that I was given was a real pig sty. The television was on a table next to the wash basin and I assumed that to wash you had to lean past this and try not to splash water on the television itself. The shower was operated by two taps, no mixer and the toilet was leaking all over the floor so I asked for another room. The door would not lock and this room was on the ground floor. They gave me a room with four beds in it and I thought okay but that night there was a fight in the adjoining bedroom that involved a lot of shouting and screaming and the following morning I checked out. I did not even bother to ask for a refund of the nights that I was not planning to stay, I was just glad to get out of the place.", "Date": "August 1, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Continental Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d1119551-Reviews-The_Continental_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$92 - $177*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">36-42 Norfolk Square</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">W2 1RT</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1119551", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/12/94/1294c9b7f3ff48907188b9be749888681large.jpg"}}
