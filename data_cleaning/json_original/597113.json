{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good for the price. I was looking for a last minute hotel for a long weekend. All hotels in Puerto Rico were full. After calling 10 or more hotels, my wife found this one. It has a good location and getting there was relatively easy. The road that takes you to the hotel, takes you to a beach, but that beach is not for swimming. The good thing is that the Arroyo Public Beach is just 15 minutes away. Arroyos public beach is not the best beach in Puerto Rico, but is nice and clean. About the hotel, it has a big pool and the restaurant is excellent. The room is small but clean, the beds are good for two and the TV has all HBO\u9225\u6a9a. The hotel needs more maintenance and the rooms some decoration, but it was much, much, much better than staying in a motel witch was my last option since all the hotels were full.", "Date": "Apr 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR646790335", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Very nice and cozy place A very nice and cozy place in the Campo.
