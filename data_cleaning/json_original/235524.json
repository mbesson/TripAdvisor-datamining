We used our own bug spray (we ALWAYS have it with us on vacation) and that seemed to get rid of the biters. I Never got bit outside, though! The grounds and pool area of Hyatt Windward Pointe were meticulous and beautiful as always. The bus line was convenient and low cost and the airport right next door, also very convenient! The Abbey Road snack shack was a great addition, and made it so you never have to leave the place unless you want to...and the food was good quality and value. The staff very nice, however, the housekeeping services left a lot to be desired as far as what they refer to as a \"tidy up\".

You can forget about enjoying breakfast on your deck on the days when your \"area\" is targeted. Fortunately, they seem to rotate. Others have complained about the airplane noise. We (on the ocean side) had little problem with this. You will see and hear the occasional commercial jet, and you will see and hear a lot of bi-planes (pretty charming!).

We usually prefer the condo/timeshare properties because of the space. This property is definitely a plus in that respect. The kitchen, bedrooms and bathrooms are all spacious. The added laundry and huge balcony is definitely a plus when travelling with kids. The property being situated next to the airport should not be taken lightly. We knew about the aiport before we arrived. A little noise doesn't typically bother us and the kids like seeing planes take off. BUT, the noise is really loud. Not little propeller planes but fairly large jets taking off over your room starting at 6:00 A.M. You get used to it after a while but smell of jet fuel is just awful. We couldn't sit on the balcony or by the pool on several days because the wind was blowing the jet fuel smell over us constantly. The rooms are also starting to show some wear and housekeeping could definitely be better. Thick dust on the toliet paper holders, chunks of tile missing, dishwasher with missing parts, dirty couch, fridge that was covered in sticky stuff, a microwave that needed to be wiped down, a shower with the slowest drain ever. Plus, the most unfriendly front desk staff. We checked in the evening and the person at the front desk was very rude. Sighed and was clearly put out when I said we were checking in. I'm not sure what the problem was but I felt like I was being rude for checking in. The location was a plus. It is definitely out of old town which we prefered with the kids. We loved visiting old town but liked that we could escape in the evenings. It is obviously easier to park and get around in new town. There are also several grocery stores down the street which made getting food easier. There is also a great pizza place close by (Mr. Z's) which delivers pizza to the property. Benihanna's is also next door. Overall, I just didn't think the amount added up to quality.

These 2 bedroom condos all have large balconies and ocean views. The balconics have wonderful tables to have breakfast or lunch at while enjoying the ocean view. They also have 2 rocking chairs which I sat in for hours while I smoked a cigar and watched the boats go by. The rooms are very spacious. The master bedroom has a gorgous private bathroom with dual sinks, a shower and seprate jacuzzi tub. The guest bedroom was decent size and had a guest bathroom with a tub/shower across the hall. The kitchen area was beautiful with granite countertops and you could also see the ocean from the kitchen area which was nice. They have a washer and dryer in your condo but i found it to be very noisy so I would not use it at night. The furniture was comfortable and stylish. The grounds were beautifully kept and we loved the infinity pool. There was also a outdoor hot tub but unfortunately they were repairing that during our stay. They have a food shack which makes cocktails and serves grilled food. The food and drinks were good and reasonably priced. You could bring your own drinks and food if you like to the pool but no glass bottles were allowed. The staff was friendly and helpful which is what you expect from a Hyatt property. The concierge arranged for any reservations we needed. Plus by staying here you had full access to the Hyatt Hotel located just off Duval street. Meals, drinks etc could all be charged back to your room at Hyatt Windward Pointe. The only negative my wife found was that it was not on the beach. Smathers beach is the largest beach in Key West and its about a mile walk down the Blvd. We usually drove down since there was never problem finding parking but the walk was nice to do during the sunset hours.

What they neglected to mention was the $5 per person fee each way, so it cost our party of five $50 for a round-trip ride and calling/getting shuttle was a pain so we went ahead with car after a day of this. We assumed shuttle to a sister property would be complimentary. Vendors come on MOndays to sell their tours and services and this was useful to hear about them all and decide what to do for the week, as well as chance to win free tours in raffle.

Others are deceptively easy and simple. Other reviewers have eloquently told about the property itself. The rooms are huge, with 2BR suites, 2 baths, full kitchen, and a gorgeous balcony overlooking the ocean. The property faces a few main challenges: 1. The property sits essentially on the runway for Key West airport, and the noise from the planes taking off is deafening. Of course, we already knew that, and were willing to deal with the planes in exchange for having a great room that was double the size, for less money, than it was to stay on the busy side of the island. 2. The rooms and property were at one point really nice, but are starting to get pretty tired. Things falling off like the toilet paper holders, a toilet that only flushes if you hold it down, a kitchen that's aging which isn't being helped when you arrive and the burners aren't connected on the electric stove. It just really needs a little bit of a facelift. 3. The worst part of the property, and probably the reason I won't be back, is the landscaping. Not the lack of it, by the way, but the care of it. We came to Key West to relax. We want some time to sit on the balcony, sip mimosas in the morning, and put the cares of the real world behind us. Instead, the landscaping crew has already begun its operation with gas powered blowers, hedge clippers, weed wackers that simply DO NOT STOP ALL DAY!!!! Read my lips Hyatt, when I'm by the pool relaxing, the 1 inch unevenness in the height of the hedge wasn't bothering me!!!! I literally was forced to leave the pool each day because I was angered to the point of a visceral response hearing the engines start up. I'm by no means a violent person, but if I thought I could take him, I would have grabbed the [--] blower out of this guys hands, and thrown it in the ocean. Forget about the gorgeous balcony, because you physically can't even hear yourself thing. I know I'm not the only reviewer to mention this. Tip for Hyatt - Buy a broom, a set of manual hedge clippers, and maybe, just maybe, a cordless electric silent blower and you'll retain far more guests.

We were greeted warmly at the front desk and after check-in we were directed to the concierge where we met Lynn who was tremdously helpful. She gave us information about small events the Hyatt was having for the week and gave us information about things to do while in Key West. She booked us a wind and wine sunset sail, a kayak and snorkel excursion, and bicycles for the week. We saw her almost every day around the resort somewhere and she always checked to make sure we were having a good time and if we wanted to do anything else. The Hyatt had a welcome breakfast on Monday where local vendors came and gave us information about fishing, biking, snorkling, sailing, etc and gave away a few prizes. We got 20% off from a lot of places if we mentioned we were staying at the Hyatt. They also had a margarita party at the pool one afternoon and hosted a wine tasting in the lobby as well. Once again, you could win door prizes and it was nice to meet other guests staying at the Hyatt. The room was great and we made breakfast most mornings in the kitchen and ate on the porch overlooking the grounds and ocean. Our room was cleaned daily and towels changed out everday as well. The grounds at the Hyatt Windward Pointe are spectacular. Other than the garden we saw at one of the Old Martello Forts, the grounds here were the nicest on the island. We biked to the Southernmost Point, Hemmingway House, and Lighthouse in about 15 - 20 minutes at a leisurely pace. The Hyatt had free parking so we spent our money parking downtown. It was maybe a 5-10 minute drive and we always enjoyed coming back to the \"quite side\" of the island to relax after the craziness of Duval St. The pool was very nice and we were able to swim almost every day. There are a couple of iguanas that hang out there and they are neat to watch. The hot tub was nice especially if it was cloudy or later in the evening. There were ample spots to soak up the sun and we saw people using the grills even though we didn't cook on them. The Abbey Road snack bar had a ping pong table and a pool table and there were two shuffleboards behind it. I'll address some issues I've read on here: Airport Noise: It's not like Key West is a major air traffic hub and we only heard one or two planes from inside our room. It was enjoyable to watch the small planes and even the few larger ones while at the pool. Key West is not that big and we acutally heard as much plane noise while at other places. Distance to Duval St.: Like I said earlier, it's a great place to get away from the crowds and relax, but it's not like it's 30 minutes away. It's a 5-10 min drive. You could ride bicycles to the heart of Duval in less than 25 minutes and just have a cab pick you up. Scooters seemed to be the way to go if you want to save the money on parking. The only negatives we encountered were the Abbey Road snack bar didn't have fish for their fish sandwiches all week. I spoke to the Abbey Road mgr and he said he was having trouble finding a good fresh fish for an affordable price. I understand that you want to serve a quality product at an affordable price, but just cover it up on the menu if you don't have a supplier. We were disappointed by this. They did have great hamburgers though. The only other thing was that my wife got bit up by some bug at the pool. It wasn't mosquitoes, but some small gnat looking bug. You might want to wear something to prevent this.

Let's deal with the primary complaint people have with this venue, its proximity to the airport. You could walk from the terminal building to the hotel but the taxi it only $4.00. Yes, you hear the airplanes especially if you are out in the parking lot or by the pool. No, we did not find them annoying. However, the jets going into the naval air station were loud enough that you could probably hear them half way to Marathon and everywhere on the island. My only other complaint was that the barbecue grills which used charcoal are in an awkward location. So, that is the total of my negative things to day about the place before I go give an otherwise glowing review. It is a very nice place. The staff was attentive and the rooms are large. It is a time share so you get the full kitchen and amenities expected of a time share. The telescope is a nice touch. We were in building four on the second floor. The view was excellent. The pool is large enough to accommodate the people that were there the days we used it. It was clean and well maintained. The grounds are pretty and exhibit nice tropical flowers. You can't walk there from Duval street, so if you are looking for the noise and \"action\" of the city's legendary night life, this may not be the place, but to my way of thinking, that is a good thing. I don't want loud parties next door late into the evening. I enjoy a place as quiet as this. You can't walk to the beach, but Smather's beach is not far away. We did nto swim there since the weather kicked up by Hurricane Irene made the waters too rough, but the beach looked nice. We ate at La Trattoria next door twice, I will post a separate review shortly. I hope to return when the weather is a little cooler.

We were very excited because it's not easy to find a property in Key West that is available for a two week period. WE have always wanted to travel to the Keys and were looking forward to total relaxation. In the past, when I have booked through Interval (mostly Marriot properties), I have called to request a room on the top floor and close to the pool. I have NEVER been disappointed with the way Marriot has treated me. Our request was honored each and every time. UNTIL NOW. For the first time, we booked a Hyatt property. As we have done in the past, we researched the property, called and requested the unit we most wanted. We were told there was no one scheduled to be in that particular unit and that they would note our request -- that it SHOULD NOT be a problem. We called several times to check on this request and were told the same each time Yesterday, my fiance called to remind them about our request and NOT ONLY DID THEY SAY THAT THE UNIT WE REQUESTED WAS NOT the unit we are assigned, but also -- WE ARE BOOKED IN A UNIT ON THE BOTTOM FLOOR! I HATE staying on the first floor of any property and have not had to do so in many years. The noise above is ALWAYS a problem. . I have been on the telephone with the front desk staff for hours and NO ONE has attempted to solve this issue.Their attitude is \"too bad, it's policy to put Intervalguests wherever....\" I am hoping this experience is not indicative of the customer service at the resort. I don't think I am asking too much to want a room on the top floor but they are acting as if I am requesting a luxurious penthouse for the price of a standard room. They keep telling me that they can't change the room assignment and that the room was assigned when we booked through Interval -- that the unit number on the reservation is the one that we \"purchased.\" BUT the most curious thing -- the units we are assigned do NOT coincide with what is on the reservation -- that tells me Hyatt DOES have the latitude to move people from one unit to another if there is a preference. Perhaps this IS a somewhat complicated process, but I always thought the business of hospitality was to have a guest leave feeling satisfied. I typically do not complain but this has me feeling so angry. I would think a Hyatt resort would want a Marriot owner to leave feeling that Hyatt is AT LEAST as interested in satisfying guest requests as is Marriot. On top of everything, they are making us move from one unit to another halfway through our stay. When I called Marriot/Interval Guest Services (at Hyatt's suggestion), they were quite surprised by the reaction of the people at the front desk and, of course, said that this would never happen at a Marriot -- they also said that if someone told us we could have a specific room -- even if it's not hotel policy -- the hotel should make EVERY attempt to honor our request. The clincher for the guest services representative was that they assigned us two separate rooms instead of leaving us in the same room for the duration of our stay. My last hope is that someone (who has the \"power\" to change our room location) at the Windward might see this posting and understand how important it is to honor a request that was granted by hotel staff, whether or not the staff member was qualified to make such an arrangement. As a business owner, I know that the customer should feel as though they are important and well cared for. This has not been the case so far. Mostly, I feel like a pain in the @@@ every time I call to let someone know about my dissatisfaction wi th the room assignment. At this point, it's the principle of the matter -- as a guest, I would like to be treated as though I matter. I will certainly follow up with a thorough review of the property. Let's hope the staff has the ability to provide the sort of service we are used to receiving at Marriot properties!

While (a few) other Key West hotels boast of a \"balcony\" maybe big enough for a chair, or a location \"near\" the water, every unit at Hyatt Windward has a huge balcony with a view of the ocean. (And every balcony has a large table with 4 chairs, plus 2 rocking chairs.) From the balcony, the view of the ocean over the lush grounds, with the palm trees blowing in the breeze, was like a postcard of what a vacation should be. Notes: -- I was very familiar with the location, because on our last trip to Key West, we drove out there every night to walk along the ocean. From the Hyatt, we only had to cross the street for our daily ocean walk. (Note this is not a walk on the beach, that's not really something you can do anywhere in Key West for more than about half a block.) -- You could get by without a car, but that wouldn't be my preference. It's a long walk to anywhere (Old Town, grocery store, but a short drive. -- The kitchen comes with all dishes and utensils required to cook and eat, plus dish towels, dish soap, dishwasher soap, and coffee. Also they provide detergent for the clothes washer. -- Before going, I would have thought a room on the end (right by the ocean) would be best, and I'm sure they would be nice; but I think it might be better to have what we had, which was a room that looks over the grounds to the ocean. -- Very clean. Very responsive service (we need only one thing in 6 nights, but we got it right away). Good restaurant advice from concierge. Good wireless internet. Beautiful pool (a little more shade would have been nice); beautiful hot tub under the palm trees. What would we do differently next time?

Most of the larger jets seemed to come in the afternoon when we were not at the hotel anyway. The earliest we heard a plane was 8:15. The only issue we had was at check-in. We arrived at 2:00,and were NOT made to feel like we were an inconvenience - in fact the man at the desk gave us a nice recommendation for lunch. When we came back at 4:00 (regular check-in time) we were told our room would not be ready for an hour and a half. (We finally got in at 5:45) So the manager offered us use of the pool and free drinks/food at the on site restaurant, and also let us use their refrigerator for perishable groceries that we had just bought. We were impressed with the honesty of the housekeeping staff. When we got to the airport in Miami, our 14 year old son realized he had left his watch and headphones in the nightstand in his room. When we called to check on them, we were informed that he had also left his camera and wallet, it was all in a bag in their safe, and they would send it to our home. Got the package from Fed-Ex 5 days later. Great service! One tip - be careful if you are booking this hotel on-line through the time-share owner. There were 2 parties while we were checking in that had done that, and were not able to check in until management had verified the owners were up to date on payments. We booked our condo through the Hyatt website and had no problems.

Quite frankly most of the airline noise wasn't from the airport next door but was from the fighter pilot's doing their training. Many fighter jets thru out the day. Again no big deal kind of cool to watch them literally ZIP on by. We would stay here again without question. Some fun things to do was the Fury \"commotion on the ocean\" sunset cruise. They had live band on catamaran and we had a blast. Also recommend the Danger Cruise full day backcountry excursion. We went sailing, snorkeling and kayaking around the mangrove islands. A fabulous trip. The boys also did the 27 mile jet-ski trip around key west and had a ball. The butterfly conservatory on Duvall Street was beautiful and I would say it's a fun thing to do too!!

The airport noise runs from 9am thru 9pm, but it isn't like being at JFK, there are very few flights, and after the first day, you barely noticed them. Shoot, I think I heard more airplane noise from the jets at the nearby Naval Air Station than from the airport. I guess my only con is that I heard floor noise from my upstairs neighbor or the water pipe noise from a toilet flushing or water draining from the jacuzzi tub in the master bath. The resort is on the eastern side of Key West, far from all the restaurants/bars on Duval Street, you will need a car or public transportation to do anything.

Make no mistake, you hear them taking off or landing, but usually just for a minute or so, so not a big deal. Did notice during spring break some college aged kids confessed to us they sneaked onto the property to use the pool and hot tub, but they were well-behaved. Plenty of parking at resort, we often had to search for parking downtown...but always found some. usually about 1.50 per hour with meters.

I'd read several recent reviews and was worried that my investment was not being properly maintained. I'd also seen some other properties being highly praised and wondered whether Windward Pointe was keeping pace, so I checked out some of these other places. I can now firmly report that I need not consider selling my unit for an \"upgrade.\" There is no place I'd rather stay in KW for what I want. Contrary to what some people may want, the location suits me for several reasons. First, it is on South Roosevelt overlooking the Atlantic. To me, this is far superior to the places on North Roosevelt, which is a busy commercial thoroughfare. South Roosevelt does not get the same kind of traffic, and even though the road is between the property and the ocean, I am not bothered by that at all. In fact, one of the things I like to do is walk or bike at sunrise on the seawall, so the location of the property is perfect for that. Second, I like that the property is away from Old Town. It's quiet at night and it's quiet during the day. If I want to enjoy the activities in town, it's a short drive away. In my mind, the reason a circus is only 2 hours long is because that is all the time most people want to spend viewing it. For KW this may be a minority view, but it's mine. Finally, it is true that the property abuts the airport, but I've never really been disturbed by the noise. Every once in a while a decent-sized craft takes off, but in a few seconds it's over. You can always complain about something, but to me it is no more than a quibble. Actually, I was more disturbed when the grass was being cut at 8AM one day. There is one further advantage to the somewhat remote location. As land is very precious in KW, some properties have units that are cheek-by-jowl and look a bit cramped. At Windward Pointe there is ample room, big balconies a lawn area, parking, and wide sidewalks. As for the living quarters, we are talking about a time-share condominium property. You get towel and garbage service every day (and more often if needed and requested), but a full service only once at mid-week. If you need an additional room service, you can pay for it. The kitchen is beautiful. You have everything you need, and you can save a lot if you are willing to eat in once in a while. The bedrooms and baths are also beautiful. For someone traveling with children, it would be nice if the second bedroom had twin beds instead of a queen, but I knew the arrangement when I purchased the unit (I was told there was a fire code issue, which I frankly find hard to believe -- but that's just how it is). Also, the balconies are really nice with really nice furniture. I've read, I've eaten, I've had card games (day and night), I've played with my laptop out there. You can't beat it. I've never had an issue with any of the TVs, DVD player or other appliances. In fact, l think having the washer/dryer is really nice because you can pack light and go home with clean clothes. Finally, the place has always been spotless -- it isn't like, as with some places, you walk around in white socks and they are dirty or you see cigar ashes. A couple of reviews talked about bugs. I certainly haven't been bugged. To comment on the common facilities: (1) There is plenty of parking; (2) The heated pool and hot tub areas are well-maintained -- and are even bigger than some larger quarters on the island (plenty for a place with only about 90 units); (3) The snack facility seems to be widely enjoyed (we make our own sandwiches); (4) There is a place for shuffleboard, pool, table tennis, and volleyball as well as some other games that you can check out from the front desk; (5) The management will set you up if you want to cook out -- it was kind of nice doing that one night as we looked out over the water; (6) if you want a fitness center, I'm told the one in the Hyatt hotel is available; and (7) The overall grounds (flowers/trees/lighting/lobby/pool furniture) are well-maintained. There is coffee in the lobby every morning. As a final note, I've never had an issue with any of the staff. The concierge service is adequate. I once had to call about a broken screen and it was fixed within an hour. I suppose anyone can have an experience that is a clunker, and I will not be critical of anyone to whom it has happened. I think that can happen anywhere, however, and I've seen no evidence that it happens too frequently at Windward Pointe. As you might expect, the property is geared for families, and you do need a car. If you want to be part of a party place, this is not it. If you want the full service of a hotel, this is not it. If you want Old Town or a place to stay where you can walk everywhere, this is not it. If you want a quaint bed and breakfast, this is not it. If, however, you want a quiet family-oriented luxury condominium overlooking the ocean with beautiful units and facilities, I've yet to see any better in KW.", "Date": "February 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cWe expected less...\u201d", "Author": "bob2010California", "ReviewID": "UR56697918", "Content": "we had some concern based on other reviews but found this property to be just fine.

The morning was cold and we wheeled our suitcases and detritus down the long side of building 8 across the back side of building 8, along the zig zag sidewalk toward the next building and on toward the elevator, the nearest (get it?) elevator to our condo unit (yes, that elevator; see my January 8th blog post \"Trapped in Paradise\" at www.adventuresofamiddleagemom.wordpress.com for details).

Huddled into my jacket, I pressed the button again, but no elevator came. We waited some more, then finally gave up. The elevator was out of order, but without a sign to let us know. We bounced our wheelies and detritus down the three long flights of steps and wheeled, kinda breathless, into the lobby to check out. At the front desk I handed in our two keys.

I replied, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, the clicker for the main television in our unit isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working at all well.

There are a number of reasons for this: 1. The literature indicated that our one-bedroom suite included a full kitchen, but they gave us the handicapped room which does not include an oven. I understand and appreciate that the hotel includes handicap-accessible rooms, but we had planned to cook most of our meals and the lack of oven was going to derail most of our cooking plans. When we talked with the front desk about changing rooms, we were informed that there were no rooms available and (exact quote) \"What do you want me to do, go out and build you another building? This conversation is over.\" Ok, it was new years week and they may very well have been full, but that kind of response is rude and unacceptable, and the literature was disingenuous. The man we spoke with is Peter, who is the Acting Property Manager. 2. They won't clean our room (they just make the beds and drop fresh towels on the floor). Two days in, after we'd complained about the poor room service, we were informed that the 8 day package that we purchased includes full room service only once, and that that day was Tuesday. Not only were we not informed of this reduced service when we booked our room, but they didn't even schedule the full service for the mid-point of our stay! (Tuesday is the day before we leave.) We did not get this room last minute or at a significant discount -- this is prime vacation time, and we paid full price! 3. The walls transmit every sound. This hotel is built next to the airport, and it is fairly new, so there were codes requiring adequate noise insulation during construction. These codes were obviously not met: we can hear every plane, all of our neighbors (next to us and above us), and everybody who walks by (especially when they're dragging a suitcase across the tiles) -- and with crystal clarity. There are some positives: the grounds are nice (but don't lay on the grass: you'll get bug bites galore), the pools are great, and the location is wonderful (walk out to the water and enjoy the sunset)! However, terrible service and having to wear ear plugs to get a good night's sleep really ruins the experience. They can improve the service (and I hope they do!), but there's little they can do to address the noise issue. Perhaps our experience is unique (given the reviews that have been posted so far), but I'm offering this as fair warning that things may have changed recently.

It has a saltwater pool that overlooks the ocean. It is right near a bus stop and the walkway where every one runs and walks runs along roosevelt right in front of the resort. We stayed here a week 8/30 - 9/6/09 (yes, still here!) The downside: There are no restaurants within 2 miles and you have to drive everywhere (benihana is next door but is always dead). It is approx. 2.5 miles to duval street or anything good in key west or stock island. Publix is about 2 miles as well. So, if you like quiet and away from the scene, this the place for you. The sales staff was surprised I was able to exchange through Interval Intl and apparently its hard to get in here. If I had a choice, I'd prefer Sunset Harbor in Old Town so I could walk everywhere, all things considered. Another downside is the noise - we are in building 5 - the airport is very loud. You can hear every plane that lands and takeoff and the noise in the condo above us (we are on floor 2) wakes us up every time they slide a door or drag a chair. Our neighbors are up all hours of the night, so sleep is an issue but . . . some people are just rude and inconsiderate. There is a beeping noise in the electrical room, after 4 days here, we have finally figured out how to reset the fire alarm b/c it is so annoying, you cannot sit outside without getting a headache. There are beautiful balconies that overlook the pool and ocean, so serene and relaxing. The kitchen is fully furnished and you can cook anything. Coffee makers, free wireless, etc. There are some grills, but you have to use charcoal. We have found all of the fresh fish markets and may take them up on it, but not really sure why there aren't gas grills. Other than the noise problems, every one is very friendly and this is a beautiful place. The Poolside Shack is good and they have happy hour every day with 2 for 1, great frozen drinks and food.

I made our reservations through Hyatt.com on May 7. On July 15, I noticed that our room rate had decreased. Hyatt advertises a best rate guarantee so I contacted Hyatt reservations by phone for an adjustment and received a confirmation email. When I went to checkout, the front desk receptionist Daniel Parker handed me my receipt showing my balance owed. It did not include my rate adjustment and was more than my original reservation rate. I showed him my email confirmation from Hyatt reservations with my new rate. He explained there was nothing he could do because he could not adjust my rate. I asked to speak to the manager. The manager Peter Tsidenkov also reviewed my confirmation email. He also explained that they could not adjust my rate and told me I would have to call reservations since I made my reservations online. When I was questioning how they could not honor a reservation made with Hyatt, Daniel became condescending and rude. The same 2 men were telling a lady in front of me the same thing when she was complaining about her bill. I told them both that this must be a pattern. I then contacted Chris from Hyatt reservations. He placed me on hold for quite some time and came back to explain that the Windward Pointe staff were reporting I made my reservations online through a third party (i.e. Expedia) so I needed to contact the third party. Chris explained that he told them my reservations were through Hyatt. I explained to Chris that I also showed Daniel and Peter my confirmation email from Hyatt.

We ordered bikes from Conch rentals ahead of time and had them delivered to the hotel the same day we arrived- then we just biked everywhere! The timeshare is about 2.5 miles from town (Duval Street) so if you're not athletic a car may be needed. Many of the cabs have bike racks or will just put bikes in their trunk so it's easy enough to get a taxi home from dinner/drinks if you don't want to make the bike back in the dark (cab ride should be no more than $15-16+tip from duval to hotel). The timeshare itself is gorgeous and clean with fabulous views of the ocean. Everything is new and it's very spacious and conducive to 2 couples.

She left the room for an hour to go to the grocery store and when she came back, all of her valuables were GONE! Besides the fact that the theives took a significant amount of property (including wedding ring, jewelry, computer, ipod, camera, cash), the manager of the property did NOTHING to console her fears. He did not even respect her enough to have contact with her and apologize face to face or offer to move her. When she tried to speak with him directly, he refused to discuss with her and treated her like she was the criminal. I was there to support her and he refused to let me stay with her. I refused to leave as we both felt he was trying to intimidate her as her husband was not there. If your sliding glass door is broken upon arrival, request another room as that is how they are set up to get in. We ended up leaving early as we were being treated unfairly and quite rudely.

A WW II battleship was sunk to make an artificial reef one morning while we were there and we watched the entire thing from the pool. The location near the airport did not cause us any problems. Planes are not going in or out of this airport very often and the ones that do are generally small but we did see and hear some when at the pool. You could not hear planes inside the unit. But I should note that we also heard and saw airplanes when we were in the Duval Street area and other areas of Key West so this does not seem to be limited to this side or area of Key West. We happened to like the location away from the craziness of Duval Street. We rented a car and used it to get where we wanted. There is plenty of free parking at the Windward Pointe and we did not have any problem finding parking in the Duval Street area either.

Music played at the pool most days. It was not crowded and we never had trouble finding a spot in the sun. The weather was warm, but windy. We went in the hot tub one night. It was pretty large and the water was hot. It says it closes at 10pm, but I think if you are quiet, no one will kick you out. The staff were not as attentive as in the Hyatt Coconut Plantation, in Bonita Springs, FL. The girl behind the front desk did not give us a whole information package, and we kept having to call with questions, like what were pool hours? I understand she was in training, but I didn't see anyone training her. It became a little frustrating. It was easier to get a cab if you walked outside yourself and hailed one, than to have the staff get you one. Some people have mentioned a shuttle service at the hotel. There is no shuttle. It is the public bus across the street. We did not use it. We took a cab 2 days. It was $4.50 per person each way, if there were 4 people in the cab. In total it was $20 each way. On the evening I decided to drive, another couple had told us about a public lot on Greene and Simonton, where you could park for $10 all day. You could easily walk to Duval from here. it is way too far to walk to town from the hotel.

The Hyatt was well equippped, and perfect for 2 couples or a family. We stopped at the Publix on the island and stocked up on a few necessities. It is a nice, clean store.

The master bedroom is great with a large tub, double sinks, and separate shower and toilet. There is also a washer and dryer in the room. We loved sitting on our balcony and looking at our view of the pool and ocean. I've read that the airplanes fly infrequently and people don't hear them. That is mainly true if you are inside your room. However, if you are outside at the pool, they are loud and you can hear them every 15-20 minutes at times. Yes, they are smaller planes, but I still found them to be slightly annoying, if trying to relax. I believe someone stated that they stop after 8 pm, but I heard some leaving after 9 pm. It wasn't the worst thing, just something to consider. The pool area was nice with a small snack shack that serves sandwiches, salads, and drinks. Although the pool area was pretty, there weren't enough chairs for everyone. Considering how big the property is, you would think they'd put out more chairs. If you weren't at the pool early, you wouldn't get a chair. Also, people would lay there towels on chairs in the morning to save their spots and not return until the afternoon. I didn't think this was fair and thought it should've been discouraged by the staff. I was aware that the hotel was at the opposite end of the island. It wasn't difficult to get to town.

Just returned from 3 glorious nights at the Hyatt Windward Pointe. I have been going to KW for about 12 years and loved this place better than any other I have stayed at or visited.

That is true, but it is also quiet, safe and beautiful. A cab is only $20, including tip, and if you rent a car, we had no troubles finding parking. 2) Airport is indeed next door, but planes are only flying during daytime, and quite infrequently. In fact it is pretty cool to see them so low. No big planes here. 3) Some rooms are close to the street, but it is not that busy a street and especially at night. For both the street and the airport, the rooms are well sound proofed. 4) The beach is down the street. If you are going to Key West for the beachs, you started ill informed. KW beachs are never good. Now onto the irrefutable stuff. The rooms are beautiful, modern, big and comfy for 4 adults (2 couples). The decks, which all look on the water are huge (4 chairs around a table, plus 2 rocking chairs). The grounds are very well manicured and beautiful. The pool is fun, with its zero edge. Lots of shady spots, but also lots of sunny spots, including the heavily desired spot right at the street, across from the ocean. The hot tub was actually hot and big enough for a crowd. Abbey Road, the pool bar, was convenient, the staff was very pleasent and the food was phenomenal at a very reasonable price. A Loaded Burger (1/2 lb, cheese, mushrooms, onions, bacon) came with chips for $8 and was one of the best burgers I have ever had. They even have 2 for 1 happy hours from 3-6 on beer, wine and frozens. This is also a time share, but not once did anybody try to make a pitch to us. Although it might have been hard to say no. It has a well stocked full kitchen AND they do daily service in the rooms.

Based on reviews we expected that this would be one of our more favorable such experiences. However, this property has some serious shortcomings and room location clearly will affect your overall experience. Also, the photographs available from the property do not reveal what is essentially a motel-like quality to the resort and the almost institutional feel about the place. And, as others have noted, the placement of the balconies right next to one another will bring you in close contact with those in adjoining units, maybe closer than you'd like! Despite our request for a top floor unit in a quiet location made in advance of our showing up and the resort manager's written communication that our request would be honored, we were advised that none were available and instead were placed in a second floor unit right next to the 4 lane road that separates the Hyatt from the water (note - there is no beach here). We were assured that we'd love the location and especially the round balcony which is larger than the others. While the balcony/porch is lovely, our time there was limited due to the traffic noise directly below us (this may have been accentuated because apparently the first week of March is \"Harley Week\" in Key West and there were an overwhelming number of them on the roads) and for some of the time, the partying spring breakers in a unit above us. Which leads me to another point -- whatever construction standards existed, they are not sufficient to mute noise from the units next door and above you. (We've not noticed that in Hyatts in Colorado, for instance.) You hear toilets flush, people walking around, drawers and cabinets closing, TVs on and as I said, if you happen to have noisy neighbors on balconies/porches next to or above yours, you will hear them inside your unit with the windows closed. And don't be lulled into thinking that the airplanes taking off at the airport next door will not be heard -- you will hear them if you are outside, though at least they do not take off late at night or too early in the morning. Speaking of early morning though, what's with the lawn mowers and hedge trimmers starting work at 8 AM? Anyhow my advice to those booking here -- steer clear of building 8 and try to get into a third floor unit. I'm sure other guests had a much more positive experience than our family did, but I feel that it is only fair to report accurately what happened to us. As for the accommodations, they are fine in terms of furniture, kitchen supplies, and linens though nothing extraordinary and certainly not luxury. Housekeeping was virtually non existent (unlike other Hyatt vacation clubs where you get your bed made and general pick up on a daily basis) and the $35 split week cleaning fee seems out of line. The front desk staff was, as others have noted, not much of a help either with room assignment or with quieting the late night partiers. Despite this, we did enjoy our time in Key West. Since we figured we can sit at a pool in other places, we decided that we'd spend most of our time exploring this interesting and beautiful community. We had no problem finding parking in town and made trips in town one or more times a day to walk around the picturesque streets and to enjoy some incredible food. While all our meals were good, we particularly enjoyed Seven Fishes, Blue Heaven for lunch, and 915 Duval for tapas. We took a drive out to Hogfish Bar and Grill for a terrific lunch on the dock. Because we really liked Key West and plan to return, we went to visit the Beach House Hyatt and after a tour there we decided that will be our choice the next time around even though it is a more dated facility.

We then dropped our rental car off at the airport as you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really need one in Key West as I will explain. However, parking is free at the hotel if you do have one. The Hyatt Windward Pointe is located just east of the Key West airport and four miles from Duval St. I can confirm as stated in other reviews, air traffic noise is not a problem; it is not a busy airport. The hotel is located on Roosevelt Blvd. which separates the hotel from the beautiful blue waters of the Gulf. FYI, there is no beach in front of the hotel which is probably just as well as it reduces the homeless population that would otherwise be hanging out there. Roosevelt Blvd. seems like it should be a busy road, but surprisingly it really isn't. A wide pedestrian/bicycle path (separate from the road) follows the water into town. I thought long and hard about the location before I booked the hotel. It is four miles from Duval Street, the center of the action. However, I can say that it was nice to retreat to our quiet hotel away from the center at the end of the day. Being four miles from Duval, you may ask how we handled the transportation issues. We do like to walk, and we did walk into town some of the time. However, for people who don't like to walk, the bus stops right outside the hotel and runs about every hour. Taking the bus is fast, and you don't have to hassle with parking near Duval St., or worry about who the designated driver will be. The hotel gave us a black and white copy of the bus schedule which wasn't great given the bus lines are named Blue, Green, Red etc. We had better luck picking up a schedule at the Key West Information center near Mallory Square. The taxis are ridiculously expensive so we didn't bother with them. Our room was located on the second floor and had a spacious balcony that gave us a great view of the Gulf (and the shuffle board area). It appeared that every room has the same great view. A telescope was provided, but I can tell you that as an optics person, it was pretty low quality. You might be able to get a slightly better view of a passing boat, but forget trying to look at the stars. We took advantage of the wonderful pool on multiple days. Sometimes it was a little too full of kids, but it was a big pool. There was a bar/caf\u00c3\u00a9 place next to the pool, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy anything. Since we did cook in our room I can warn you that the smoke alarm will go off even if you are not burning anything. Yes, there was a sign on the microwave recommending one use the vent fan, but I kind of missed it. The friendly Hyatt staff knocked on our door to ensure that we were not burning the place down. The beds/bedding/furniture/cleanliness etc, were as expected for a good Hyatt, no complaints. The service was perfunctory, but adequate. We were taking the Key West Express boat to Fort Myers at 6pm on our last day and asked if we could store our luggage at the other Hyatt near the boat terminal. They called and made the arrangements. By the way, our 6 pm boat departed at 5:30 pm, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be late. We either ate in our room or near Duval street. The only restaurant nearby the Hyatt is a Benihanas, and there is no restaurant within the hotel. We ate at two great restaurants in town. The first was El Siboney which is a wonderful inexpensive Cuban restaurant. The other place we liked was Santiago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bodega \u00e2\u20ac\u201c excellent tapas! Blue Heaven was decent, but I would go to Santiago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. We took a bicycle tour with Lloyds. Loved the stop at the secret garden/ parrot rescue place (Nancy Forrester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Secret Garden), but was otherwise unimpressed with the tour. It was nice to sample unusual fruits, but there was no discussion of the history or architecture of Key West, and the bikes sucked! Instead, definitely make a stop at Nancy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Garden and check out the many parrots who will chat with you.

If you can get past the planes flying overhead and the road in front of the hotel, its actually not a bad place. It has ping-pong, shuffle board, a nice pool and a volleyball court with sand. The patios are also very large. Rooms: Very nice. No complaints here. Maid service: Relatively good. They make the beds each morning, load the dishwasher and take out the garbage.

Very few recommendations were offered in terms of activities and restaurants. I had to do the legwork myself.

It is simply an OK place to stay with your family if you plan to be out and about town enjoying Key West.

The room was great, well appointed with all the necessary amenities with maybe the exception of a pizza slicer. Service was as expected, but we didn't expect much with this location since it is a time share resort. The front desk check-in was painless and offered some useful basic information and a map. The check-out process was a breeze that took less than 30 seconds. The resort sits on a main road, that is oddly not that busy. Across the street is a very wide walk way which rests on a ocean wall (no sand/beach). The on site pool, hot tub, volley ball court were great. It was unseasonably cool (mid 60's to low 70's) so the pool was mostly out of the picture, but was nice for the few hours we had in the low/mid 70's. The on site snack bar was sufficient (the full blown Hyatt restaurant is at the other Hyatt location across town near Duval). The island \"entertainment\" itself was enjoyable. We spent every evening on Duval street strolling through the shops and deciding which restaurant to eat at. We first tried a Cheeseburger joint which we did not even remotely enjoy. The service was fine, even good, but the food was horrible. Mushy fish and a \"grey\" chewy hamburger - yuck! Needless to say that experience turned us off from the local fare for a bit. We also visited the Hard Rock Cafe (very good), and a place called Fogerty's (very good - best potatoe soup ever!) There was also a very good ice cream joint a few blocks down Duval (non-chain). I don't recall the name, but it was on the street with a white little fence separating it from the street and some bar style seating. With a 2 yr old and another sub 21'er, we didn't participate in any of the wild night scene. There were however plenty of bars which seemed to be quite popular. Random thoughts/things I remember -The train tour was $29 a person for 1.5 hr tour - we passed on it. -The best beach (read no homeless sleeping in the sand) was Ft. Zachery State Park. Well worth the fee to enter (based off car occupancy or walking/biking in...it's gated so you'll likely need to pay unless super sneaky). I think the cost was around $1.25 / person. It is slightly hidden, so just follow the coast or find maps/directions. It took us awhile to find the actual entrance. -There are bicycles & scooters/mopeds _everywhere_ -There is a fair number of homeless, you'll see them on the more popular corners offering to take your picture, playing music, making things from palm leaves, or simply sleeping on the open beaches. They are however mostly harmless, of the 20-30 we saw, only one even attempted to ask for money. -There are pink taxis all over - pointless, but funny -There is a drag queen bar/club who promotes their club by driving a convertible white car down Duval every night around 8-9pm throwing beads to the crowd and stopping for pictures with requesting travelers. Even with a family we didn't feel uncomfortable however. -In the NE USA we have squirrels, Key West... they have chickens. Yes - roosters were all about the non beach/non Duval street areas cockadoodle-doing and running in front of our car. -The Hyatt was too far from any \"nice\" beaches to walk, but a bike for a bit older family would have worked just fine. -The small Key West airport was right next to the resort, but unless you were actually at the pool during the day (and not at the beach?) you would never know it. Mostly small prop planes, with a handful of small jets. Didn't notice a single takeoff/landing past 8pm. Overall, well worth the trip. We had a promotion rate on the Hyatt Windward but I could see it being worth $400 or so otherwise. If we had paid more than our sub $200 price tag I would have expected an onsite restaurant and a real concierge. Last but not least, the sales pitch was rescheduled due to staff cuts, which was rather annoying. In the end however the Hyatt time share rep (Marius) was quite pleasant and non pushy. Had we been able to remotely afford it (half our trip was free due to credit card points or gifts from relatives), we would have likely purchased a time share through him. In all, it took 90 minutes and was quite informative.", "Date": "February 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vermont", "Title": "\u201cA most enjoyable stay in Key West\u201d", "Author": "Dockpotato", "ReviewID": "UR23953731", "Content": "This was my first stay at Hyatt Windward Pointe and could not have been more pleased.

Actually the only problem we had is that we booked on expedia, and after we checked in I called the front desk to ask if we could have a unit with a balcony not quite so exposed to the common walkway, and at that point I feel like I was treated like a second class citizen for \"booking online\", as the front desk person put it, and couldn't be moved to another unit, because I had \"booked online\". It turned out not to be too bad, and I'm glad I didn't waste my energy making a stink over it, the reality is, all the units there have balconies that are quite exposed to balconies of other units, not very private. I have to say, even though the balconies are not very private, we still had a great time at this resort, and definitely will want to stay there again, when we return to Key West. The Pros: --Very Clean units, I even walked around the unit in my bare feet, which I never do in a hotel!! --Very well stocked units, my brother and I said how we and even more guests could easily have stayed a week and relaxed and enjoyed ourselves, we were sad we were only staying four nights. There are lots of dishes, glasses, flatware, and other kitchen necessities, such as blender, toaster, food processor, coffee maker, it was great! --Large balconies/lanais, even though they are not very private, meaning you can see a lot of other balconies from yours, and smell cigarette smoke from people smoking on their balconies in the early morning, the balconies are large with nice tile floor, a nice dining table with four chairs and two comfortable wicker rocking chairs. It looked to me like you could see the ocean from all the balconies, and there is a telescope, although I was never able to use it very well. --The bed in the second bedroom was a queen and I thought not very comfortable (too hard for me), there is a king in the master suite. The master suite opens directly into a bath with two sinks, a clean looking jacuzzi tub, and a separate toilet room and separate shower stall. Both bedrooms had a decent sized closed, a tv, and a luggage rack. Very comfortable, other than the beds not being super comfie. --I loved the pool at this resort, felt and smelled clean, although didn't have an obvious chlorine smell, was large enough to proving private areas for different people to swim, we very much enjoyed the pool, especially at night when no one else was there, I think the hours were 8am to 10pm. --There is no restaurant or room service, as this is a condo resort, you certainly could prepare anything you want in the full kitchen, only thing I noticed missing was a pizza cutter. There is a snack and drink bar by the pool that is open only till 6pm with a quite limited menu, we never used it so I can't comment on the offerings. --There is a huge green iguana that wanders around the property, that is fun to keep track off, there are two shuffle board courts which we found fun to play on the way too and from the pool. --Note, for anyone arriving in the evening and wanting to get some groceries, the front desk dork told me about a Publix, that was already closed, thanks a lot dips..t, come to find out there is an Albertson's on North Roosevelt Highway open 24 hours, I found out while buying 50 bucks worth of groceries at the gas station...so embarrasing. You would think an evening front desk person at a resort in a tourist town would be able to tell you about the 24 hour grocery store when you arrive at 8pm hmm, maybe next time. --Location...so funny, my biggest reservation in reserving this resort was the fact that it is a four mile drive from downtown, making driving in to town necessary, and I read how you can never find any parking in town. Sweet surprise for me, we parked easily in town, three different days, these were in mid October, so I don't know about all seasons, but I found parking every day within 5 minutes and just had to feed the meter a couple bucks of change. Also, my brother and I both found it very refreshing to drive back to \"the quiet side of the island\" at the end of the day, and back to our nice resort, after being in the touristy bluster of downtown Key West for the afternoon. Ironically I found the one thing I thought I wouldn't like about the resort, the location, to be surprisingly refreshing! I would definitely recommend this resort, although I would caution that in my opinion, not more than four people would be comfortable in any given two bedroom suite.

The pool is nicely sized for the resort with a hot tug, sand volleyball court, shuffle board, pool table, pool side bar, and areas for grilling. The unit was very clean with no problems with anything. We were ocean side with a great clear view of the ocean. This resort is within walking distance to the Key West airport. At first I was a little concerned with noise. After a day there I realized it is not any issue. The airport is small so the only air traffic is a few small jets and turbo prop planes. The airport has the same schedule everyday and air traffic is minimal. The Hyatt is on the ocean across a two lane road. There is not a beach. However, there is a nice walking path that goes for a couple miles along the ocean wall. It is walked, jogged, and biked by many people everyday and night. It is a mile walk to Smathers Beach. Duval Street is about 3 miles. Having a car is important at this resort. Parking in Key West was not bad at all. We never had a problem finding a spot within a couple blocks of Duval Street. The resort is a timeshare and someone will ask you for your time to go over the plan. We politely declined and went on our way. We were not bothered at all. The resort also brings in local businesses once a week to talk about their tours. We found this to be a great opportunity and took advantage of some of the great offers. We found the Hyatt Windward Pointe to be a very nice relaxing resort. The staff were polite and the pool side bar guys were great. The ocean view from the pool was great, the morning walks along the ocean walkway were great. The unit was great. We would definately go back.

We bought the 4 day shuttle pass for $65 and this worked very well for our entire family during our stay. It basically left every hour from the resort and dropped us off right in the middle of the action downtown in about 15 minutes. There was a nearby grocery store to where the shuttle dropped us off, and we stocked up with food and drinks the first morning. They also have quite a few restaurants that delivered to the resort - we ordered Chinese take-out one day and it arrived in 20 minutes! The shuttle drivers were very friendly also. I honestly didn't miss the hassle, stress and cost of driving and parking downtown. We got a chance to meet quite a few friendly people in the shuttle from different parts of the country.

The condo was large enough for the 5 of us to all have our own space. The pool was large and kept very clean, and it was very easy to find lounge chairs. Nice volleyball court, ping pong and shuffle board. The Abbey Road snack bar had excellent food and great cooks - very friendly. Their liquor license had been temporarily suspended during our stay which saved us quite a bit on our bar bill! We basically brought our own stuff to the pool that we picked up at the grocery store. Not sure if it was due to the fact that were a nightly rental (not time-share) but we had some pretty good maid service every day - emptying trash, making the beds, replacing the towels. The desk clerks and concierge were very friendly and helpful the whole time we were there.", "Date": "March 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "midway, GA", "Title": "\u201cNice relaxing stay\u201d", "Author": "ugagirly", "ReviewID": "UR14437892", "Content": "We had a nice time at this hotel.

Since we have young children we decided to stay away from Duval Street at night especially on New Years Eve. We were pleasantly suprised how quiet it was on New Years at the resort. The condo was very nice BUT they seemed to have a major problem with sugar ants. They were there when we arrived and after a day of killing some everytime we went by the kitchen we decided to call the front desk. They did send up maintance who sprayed. The ants did stay away for about 2 days but came right back. We were on the third floor so they were coming all the way up. Across the street from the hotel was a nice walkway that you could look down into the ocean. The water was so clear that we say several stingrays, lots of fish, and (what we thought) an small octopus. My daughter loved walking just about everyday! The airport was right beside the hotel. The noise didnt seem to bother any of us. I could not hear it at night and it was actually fun watching them come in during the day. We did go into town during the day and that was fun but traffic and parking was UNREAL!! We finally got smart and paid for the trolley to take us around, although, we had to wait for 3 trolleys because they were always full. That seemed to be a problem that they could have fixed by sending out more. Also, they didnt offer anything to do at the hotel (as far as actvities). We did play ping pong. We didnt eat at the small snack shop. Weather was very warm the first few days but then very cool the last 3 or 4 days. The front desk workers were very pleasant and helpful. Overall the hotel was good but because of the bugs and the weather we left a day early and I would only give this an average rating. We personally would not stay here again.

More Like a Tattoo Convention!\u201d", "Author": "DC_World_Traveler", "ReviewID": "UR8725769", "Content": "The Hyatt Windward Pointe Resort is an ill-kept property of aging cookie cutter 2-bedroom condos, literally within walking distance of Key West\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tiny airport terminal. Situated on the southeastern corner of the island, the resort is about a 20-40 minute bicycle ride, depending on traffic, or a $15-$20 cab ride from Old Town Key West. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something wrong when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been over a decade and a property is still struggling to sell time shares. The front desk staff and concierge are all inexperienced, so the place muddles along without much apparent supervision or inspiration. The resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clientele is uncouth at best, and the place is really lacking good management. I was surprised Hyatt put its name on the place. There is no room service other than bath towel replacement during your stay, so get used to unmade beds if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re endeavoring to relax. The two bedrooms are completely disproportionate in size and luxury level. While the master suite has an adjacent large jacuzzi tub, a two-sink vanity and separate commode room and shower stall, the tile was worn, and the dark shower had a foul odor coming from the drain. The whirlpool bath wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sparkling, so I never used it, as after my experiences in the pool and other areas of the property, I decided its filters had likely not been cleaned in some time While the master had a king, the second bedroom on the airport side of the unit had only a double bed and small closet. The second bathroom with a real tub was across the hall from the second bedroom at the unit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entrance and not very private at all. The kitchen was large and fully stocked, and there is ample dining space for four people at a table. Though all the furniture was old and downright uncomfortable, particularly the living room chairs. The TVs are cheap and antiquated, and the DVD vending machine in the main lobby was broken during my stay. A pleasant bonus was some Tide samples and a full size washer dryer to wash my clothes after biking. The property has a medium-sized freeform pool with 3-5\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 depths in dire need of painting and even standard maintenance, a small pub called Abbey Road, as the Beatles reportedly came to this area in the 60s, and a billiards and ping pong table adjacent. There is shuffleboard, volleyball, and a lawn swing to round out the outdoor amenities. The other guests during my stay were running dangerously around the pool deck, screaming at young children, or caught up in various PDAs in the pool, rendering it a bit less enjoyable than I had hoped. Tattoos, body piercings, and cigarettes abounded. Palm trees are a nice touch, but the layout of the place is tedious to negotiate, with eight buildings that fan out to insure that the balconies face the Atlantic side. There is reciprocity with the Hyatt Key West Hotel downtown on Front Street, so take advantage of their fitness center, to which you have access by getting a key card from the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front desk. There are a few worn treadmill and elliptical machines and a bike, along with a stability ball and some stretch cords at the hotel. No weights were available, though a bench was sitting in the middle of the room. The Front Street hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool is smaller than the resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is about a fifteen foot strip of a cove leading to where the boats dock and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153raft\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with two wooden slat chaises without cushions. There are no private showers outside of guest rooms at the hotel, so you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to shower after your workout or swim, unless you want to bring some shampoo and soap to the poolside shower spigot. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s such a long way back to the resort that I did that one day just to freshen up for my evening in town. There are bathrooms near the bar on the pool level to change. The Windward Pointe boasts that every unit has an ocean view, and you could indeed look over the property and the adjacent road and see a tad of the Atlantic from the balcony. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a large esplanade sidewalk that borders the Atlantic with a seawall that runs along the southern part of the island and runs by Smather\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Beach, a smelly place with trash washed ashore that the locals told me everyone but tourists avoid. The only clean beach on the island is Ft. Zach[ary Taylor] Park, which is situated off the western side of Key West through a gated community known as The Truman Annex, after the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retreat house, which is situated in its midst. Ft. Zach\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beach is sandy and then rocky in the shallow areas, so dive boots or fins are much appreciated if you have sensitive toes. You can rent snorkel gear and even kayaks at a stand, and concessions and indoor changing rooms and outdoor showers are available. It costs $1.50 per pedestrian or bicyclist to enter, and $3.50 for vehicles. There are fish to see, and the place is full of locals and foreign guest workers, who basically run all the service-oriented businesses on the island. Downtown Key West is full of bars, shops and vendors. Alonzo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Oyster Bar on Front St. near the Hyatt Hotel property is the best bet I found during my stay. They have half price drinks and menu items from 4-630 daily, and the quality of the seafood and service is superb. Mallory Square performances each evening before sunset are great too. I highly recommend the Danger Charter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full day snorkeling and kayaking trip, as it was a great outdoor adventure to sail and experience the Keys from the ocean. It was very professionally run, and snacks, lunch and endless beverages from the Waterside Market were on board for our dining and drinking pleasure. Hemingway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house is another must-see. Cruise ships empty thousands onto Duval Street during the day, so plan on being out on the water or recreating while the masses are in town. Oh, and the time share presentation wound up being three hours, as I was open-minded, but the sales guy had to ask his manager most of my questions, prolonging the time spent. I don't think anyone breaks two hours though. After four days and three nights on the property, I decided that the place was really populated by and suited for a different demographic than to which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m accustomed at Hyatt resorts worldwide. While the promo lodging offer price was right, the distance from downtown, and lack of inexpensive transit thereto, made staying at the Windward Pointe just plain awkward. If you plan to bike, be forewarned that the street lights aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always turned on, rendering the pitch black trip along the sea wall a bit treacherous after dark. There is a homeless population that sleeps along the wall between Smather\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Beach and the Windward Pointe, which I discovered just before my bike almost hit someone near midnight..

We were looking for a place to stay for 2 couples. After much research, we made our reservations here. Price wise, it was a little more than getting two rooms at the hotel we were considering and looked to have many more perks than a regular hotel room. When we arrived, the check-in was quick and smooth. The condo was beautiful and just as nice as we had hoped. It was clean and nicely decorated. The kitchen was lovely. Master bath was huge. Loved the balcony and the view (which was very similar to the traveler's photos posted here for this place..... I swear, those folks must've been right next door!). I was a little concerned about the airport being next door, but it turned out to be not a problem at all. The only time we heard the planes was when we were sitting on the balcony, and then it was a quick takeoff and they were gone. When we were inside the condo, we didn't hear them at all. It's a very small airport with not alot of air traffic. There were a couple small issues...... We knew that there would be a charge for internet access, so that wasn't a surprise. (It seems to me that, more often than not, internet isn't free anymore.... And the more expensive the property, the more likely the charge.) It took several calls to get the internet access working for us. It would work for a minute and then shut down. It would be nice to just have it work without having to call the help desk, leave a message, and then wait for them to call you back. We waited.... finally called them back..... they said they hadn't gotten the message. The same thing happened the second day, but at least they did call us back right away. All in all, it wasn't a huge thing..... just annoying. Another thing was that the bed in the master bedroom was a bit soft and probably could stand to be replaced. It also seemed low to the ground (and I'm only 5'3\"). It didn't keep me from getting a good nights sleep. I'd rather have a mattress that's too soft as opposed to a very firm one, so it wasn't an issue for me, but might be for someone else. I didn't ask the other couple if their bed was alright and they didn't mention it, so I can't comment on that. We had a rental car, so we drove everywhere and parked in the city garage when we wanted to head to town. When we were checking out and sitting on a bench at the front entrance, a van pulled up and asked if we were waiting for the shuttle going to town. We didn't know there was a shuttle to town!!!!! Again, not a big deal.... we probably would've driven anyway.... but it would've been nice if the staff had shared that information with us at check-in so we were aware of the option.

The resort is at the end of the Key West Airport. I had been concerned about noise, but to my surprise it wasn't that bad. The planes and small jets take off and are gone very quickly. It is not a busy airport. The suites are very nice. There are two bedrooms, kitchen, dining area and living room area. All floors of the suite are tiled. All suites have a view of the Atlantic Ocean from their balconies. Being on the east side of the island allows one to view the sunrise. We only had to walk across the street to get a spectacular view. The grounds of the resort are very well maintained. There is also a small place by the pool where you can order food and drinks. Their hours are 10AM to 6PM. Happy hour is 3PM to 6PM. We have been told that the resort doesn't cater to the \"Spring Break\" crowd. I don't know if this is true or not, but closing the bar area at 6PM doesn't allow late night drinking on the resort grounds. The concierge at the resort will arrange off site activities at a discount price. We rented bikes through the concierge and the company delivered the bikes to us. The same goes for scooters. The boating excursions the resort deals with are not the party ones. The only thing within walking distance of the resort is the airport. We found out when we were leaving that there is a lounge at the airport. A beach is about a mile away. We had a rental car so we were able to go to the shopping centers the locals go to and buy groceries. These shopping centers are at a distance of 2 miles and greater. Downtown is 5 miles away. There is a downtown bus that stops in front of the resort every 30 or 60 minutes. If you want to explore the side streets of Key West, then I recommend renting a bike.", "Date": "March 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cNice resort - some noise\u201d", "Author": "Florida-Falcon", "ReviewID": "UR7155171", "Content": "My wife and I stayed the first week in March.

We couldn't even sit on our deck because of the noise. It started early morning and continued into mid evening. We did orginally ask if we could cancel our 2 night reservation but because we booked it through expedia we were pretty much tossed around in a circle and although the Hyatt admitted that there was in fact construction going on, since it is not on their property they didn't feel as if they should grant us our request with out charging us for one night.

This time-share condo was clean, comfortable and had all the amenities of home including a dish washer, oven, hob, washing machine, dryer and a jaccuzi which was big enough for two. The whole appartment was furnished in the style of Hemingway with very tasteful decor. The only one flaw in the whole set-up was that due to the hurricane the ceiling fan on our balcony was not working properly but that was a minor detail. We had a beautiful view out onto the gardens and the Atlantic even though we were placed well back and on the ground floor. The kids loved the fact that there were 3 tv's and that they had their own room and bathroom without having to sleep in a seperate appartment. There was also a telescope for our use and we managed to take a lovely photo of the moon. The Hyatt is for people who want to get away from all the cruise ships and tourists who seem to take over Duval Street and the down town area. There was a shuttle service from our condo to the town which we didn't use as we had a hired car but the parking is very expensive so it is a great option.

The dining table and the rest of the furniture was very tasteful and very well-decorated. We liked the tropical plantation theme. Hyatt knows how to do it right. We spent a lot of time on the large spacious lanai/patio. It also had excellent comfortable patio furniture, not resin stuff. We had a great ocean view room. We had good service. Because of the way we booked the room (different rates and different reservation systems), we were told that we were going to have to change rooms midstay.

Nice ocean view from the pool and spa. For the people who complain about the lack of service, I must comment that The Hyatt Winward Pointe is NOT a full service Hyatt hotel - it is a timeshare type of property. It is intended for extended (weekly) stays, and is basically self service, which is why it has a kitchen in the suite. Almost all \"vacation condo resorts\" are like this, and one should not be disappointed, as it is intentionally set up this way.
