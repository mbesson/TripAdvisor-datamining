{"Reviews": [{"Content": "John Douglas The worst hotel experience I have ever had in Bali, on this my 11th visit.Room was in appalling condition. Toilet did not flush, shower flooded, phone fell off the wall. General maintenance appalling.But that was not the worst. The cleaner pointed out to us when we arrived that the top of the cistern was broken. We were blamed for that even though we did not do it. We were told we had to pay 650k rupiah. If we did not pay we were going to be thrown into jail. This is a scam run bythe assistant front office manager 1 Waylan Tillage and the cleaning staff. It is never fixed and the next unsuspecting guest gets caught.Do not stay there unless you want to be ripped off or wish to go to jail.", "Date": "Aug 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR329397045", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "johndd54"}, {"Content": "Very clean, comfortable and quiet Hotel was very nice. Constantly kept very clean and the staff were very friendly and always helpful. Very quiet around the pool and restaurant area and most nights the pool bar closed early as there was no one around. Only thing wrong was the room walls are very thin and we had the luck to have a group of loud guys next door who came home late and were pretty noisey. Otherwise the location was good for walking into Kuta which was good for our first trip into Bali. Perhaps next time we would stay a bit further out in a more luxury hotel with a bit more going on.", "Date": "Oct 31, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR536300091", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "amanda_sw"}, {"Content": "Disappointed Rooms basic and often dirty, breakfast menu very limited mostly Indonesian food. Hotel allows guests to get drunk and act in a loutish and uncontrolled manner around the pool. Very noisy all night with drunken guests at the pool all night and music playing through speaker system loud and late at night. Appears to cater for Indonesian guests for 3 and 4 day holiday weekends.", "Date": "Oct 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR729679627", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "DISAPPOINTED60"}, {"Content": "Good location, but poor service and average rooms       The pool", "Date": "May 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR892034830", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "marcstrauch"}, {"Content": "Great little hotel We stayed at the Legian Paradiso for a friends wedding (at the Mandira) with a group of 20+ and the staff could not bend over backwards enough for us! The 1st room we were given was a little mouldy in the bathroom so another was requested and given straight away and which was a upgrade (mind u we were the only people in the hotel almost!) Room service was great for the late mornings breakys, the buffet breaky was good enough choice not to enough to make it hard  did not dine there for anything other than breaky. Stayed in total 2 weeks for the price of 1 at other nicer hotels, was a really comfortable stay with very friendly staff!Dont fee the cats!

Entrance and service at the reception is not impressive. If you want to be comfortable, the standard rooms are not the right choice. The loo's were dissappointing in the standard room. But we changed to the luxury room and it was much nicer, clean, with a nice balcony overlooking the pool, good bathroom with a tub..and the small things which you cant help but notice, like better curtains, bedsheets and better flooring.Room service was great. We ordered in a lot and the food was really good. We got really good massages at the hotel's small massage parlour. Kuta beach is a walk away from here. Cabs to beaches like Nusa Dua or Jimbaran were not expensive from the hotel. All in all, good for a first time stay, but next time we go to Bali we'd prefer something fancier!!", "Date": "Aug 13, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR545225599", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "GupAdvisor"}, {"Content": "Good Value!! Its definately worth the upgrade to the deluxe pool view room. Rooms were old looking, but clean and comfortable. The staff were friendly and the pool was really nice! The included breakfast was great and the location of the hotel is perfect! Just be careful when booking day trips from the front of the hotel....you can find way better deals if you shop around.
