The gym doesn't open until 8am, so I didn't get to work out at all during our stay since I like to get it done before breakfast. There is a well equipped kitchen in our room so we went grocery shopping and were able to cook some meals to save money. However, buying your own booze is kind of a waste unless you are slick enough to sneak it into the pool area. There is no outside food or drink allowed in the common areas which is especially insulting since the drinks you buy at the lounge are VERY expensive and watered down. They have cans of beer for $5.50 each. Also, a breakfast burrito is upwards of $10 so eat in your room as much as possible. I would also suggest ordering from the local restaurants. The food is much better and much cheaper and they are glad to deliver! The website boasted a shuttle to the strip and a rooftop garden. Neither of these things existed when we were there. Since the shuttle was not running and cab fare is expensive, we rented a car. The wi-fi is not included and requires a half an hour of setting up an account with AT&T. The best part of the resort is the pool area, as long as you're smart enough to make your own drinks in the resort's cups and sneak them in. There weren't any real activities and there was no night life. Overall, a nice place for families but bring lots of cash, as they nickel and dime you to death. I would stay there again, but only because we stay cheap using a timeshare. If you have to pay a regular rate or are traveling as a romantic getaway or are looking to be wowed, I'd suggest staying closer to town or somewhere with more amenities.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irving", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation Resort\u201d", "Author": "rrshep52", "ReviewID": "UR128441149", "Content": "We traded our units at Tahiti Village for three of the one-bedroom units at this resort in April and had great service from check in to check out.

The only issue we had during our stay was a party going on till late hours in an adjoining unit. When I mentioned it at check out, I was told that the quiet time started at 10:00 pm and that we should have called. One item to mention too is that we had one unit on the pool side which had a beautiful view but the music being played at the pool in the evenings was very loud. Our one bedroom unit had a pull out sofa in the living room to allow for accomodations for 4 people. The bedroom size was adequate. There was a large adjoining bathroom with a whirlpool tub that could fit 2 people. There was also another full bath off the living room and folding doors in the living room doorway that you could use to create a private space.

We'd give the resort a \"D\" rather than a \"C\" because for some ridiculous reason, the resort decided to close the only heated pool with the slides for maintenance for three days of our stay. Really? During spring break season? The staff was moderately accommodating (except for several cranky lifeguards) but not what we've experienced elsewhere. OVERALL - not enough to keep kids busy for a week. Just hanging at the pool gets old for preteen kids who don't want to participate in the organized activities. Preschoolers need a more shallow pool. Food on site is mediocre. No recycling. Too far to walk to most food/entertainment and cabs are expensive. Wifi isn't free. Probably better to trade time for mom & dad to get away here and take the family elsewhere. It was too chilly to be there in late March and expect to spend the week at the pool. The wind was also too strong to be poolside on a couple of days. One day the high was 52. Keep in mind the day's high temp may not be reached until mid-afternoon. We went to the fun dome at Circus Circus one colder day ($30 cab ride both ways) and took the kids to see the Bellagio fountain, etc. on the strip another day. ROOMS - one owner told us the two buildings closest to the lobby have bigger rooms. We had a first-floor room closest to the heated pool. Be advised - it's not the ground floor so there are still stairs, or the elevator in the other direction from the pool. The room was fine. Kitchen was small but contained everything we needed but could have used more than 6 serving pieces. Had to wash dishes every meal and ran out of diswasher soap twice. Baths have jet tubs. Beds were very comfortable and there are new TVs in bedrooms and living room. Lots of towels and pillows, fairly clean. Have to call for trash pickup, which you'll need daily with the small kitchen trash cans. Rooms are cleaned on Wednesdays if you're staying a week. FOOD - a real dissapointment. There are two restaurants, one open for breakfast and the other for lunch/dinner. Food was OK, not great. Sandwiches, salads, fried food (see menus in attached photos). We rolled in at noon on Sunday and after spending $60 for 2 adult and 2 kids meals + beverages, decided to find groceries fast! We didn't eat there again except for poolside nachos served with that gloppy ballpark cheese-like substance. NEARBY - Food 4 Less grocery is across the street (a busy 6-lane highway) but it has everything except great wines. Check the liquor stores nearby if you want that. There are a couple of fast food outlets in the same vicinity. Bootlegger Italian was really good, about a 1/2 mile north of the grocery store (we walked). Cane's Chicken is 1.5 miles and Southpoint casino is about 2 miles south of the resort ($10 cab ride). GENERAL RESORT AREA - Overall a lovely property surrounded by a not-so-lovely empty lot (the resort is expanding) and a motor home park. Just don't expect a view unless you face the strip to the north. There were four covered hammocks (under 14 not allowed, used it anyway). Plenty of pool chairs and cocktail tables when we went, nice lighting at night. Four hot tubs around the property for everyone plus an adult tub inside the pyramid. The resort in on the flight path for the airport so there is a lot of airline traffic (not directly overhead). It wasn't an issue since the pyramid waterfall masks the noise. Kind of fun to see the planes come and go. We made a game of \"which airline will be next?\" POOL - No outside food or beverages allowed. People still brought stuff and I didn't see anyone accosted for it. But no coolers, not even if you buy the drinks there. You have to cover up and put on shoes to visit the restaurant or the sundry shop (snacks + household basics). Best deal at the shop - large Arizona iced tea cans for $1. Expect to hear music from the vast speaker system all day. One float per room (the cheap foam type that barely supports a child) and you can't bring your own? You can BUY one for $11 at the sundry shop that you're allowed to use. The lifeguard actually checked at the shop to make sure we bought a raft and didn't bring our own. Sheesh. You are allowed circular floats for the kids. We also used our inflatable basketball hoop and squirt guns with no problem. The larger pool isn't heated (may be for the summer). The heated pool is 4 1/2 feet deep, way too deep for our preschooler. He played on the entry steps. The water slide is part of the same pool, separated by a rope. That side of the pool has the four water slides and is 3 1/2 feet deep. Whoever designed that got it backwards. My daughter thought the water slides were fun. All are tunnels, not partially open slides. KID'S CLUB - lots of movies to watch, games to play, crafts and some electronic toys. We played popcorn bingo ($3/card, min. 5 players) and the kids won prizes. There are indoor and outdoor organized activities about every hour during the day. Great staff! Thanks for doing this part right. ADULT LOUNGE - big screen TV, three pool tables (under 14 not allowed to play, did anyway), foosball and ping pong. Also chess tables, booths and a sofa area. Kids liked it. There is also a paid computer area.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNot for me!\u201d", "Author": "Lovetotravel19882012", "ReviewID": "UR126811581", "Content": "The facility was clean and the staff friendly.

Unfortunately for us, the weather was nasty and the large pool, as well as several of the spas, was closed for the season. I think that if we had come in the summer and been able to enjoy the outdoor facilities this would be a totally different review. We phoned ahead and requested the best view available. We were given a two bedroom condo on the sixth floor of building five. It had a large patio (again, too cold to use) and a great view of the Strip in the distance with the mountains behind. We were able to find a parking spot in the underground garage about half the time, but the outside parking was also convenient. There are carts to help you get your things up the elevators and to your room, but they have to be hunted down during the popular check in and check out times. Our rooms were very clean and quiet. The master bed was way past its due date, with a large gully on one side. Two overhead lights were burned out and they remained burned out through our stay, despite repeated calls to get them fixed. The kitchen was the smallest \u201cfull\u201d kitchen we have ever experienced in a condo. There were no serving platters or bowls. The living area was cramped with four adults and the furniture was uncomfortable. The wind whistled under our door even though we were way down the hall from the entrance. We finally blocked the bottom of the door with a towel. The drive to the Strip was not bad, especially when we took the side streets to our chosen locations. There was plenty of free parking in the casinos. We could have taken a cab, but the resort staff informed us that the one way charge was $ 25 and that was more than we wanted to pay. We took a day trip to the Red Rock area and that was well worth it. The Town Square Shopping Center just down the street is very attractive with a lot of good stores and restaurants. We especially enjoyed the Brio Tuscan Grill. We also got several meals at the Whole Foods Market and just brought them back to the condo rather than try to cook. We ate once at Steiners across the street from the resort, but the noise level was excessive and the food was not worth it. Pros: Great outdoor facilities \u2013 weather permitting. Quiet.

The apartment was generally on the small side - particularly the kitchen but acceptable. The balcony is quite large but they could improve the practicallity of it, by making better furniture available - it is currently wasted space as you cant really use it. The apartments are quite dark and would benefit from lighter furniture - I think they are remodelling some of the apartments so perhaps this is part of the plan. The air-conditioning was effective but extremely noisy - the whole apartment shook - so much that the lightfitting shattered! The pool area is good (pool is not heated) and slides etc for kids - the music a bit too loud at times - but maybe we are just getting old! The transport to the strip was ad-hoc, when we arrived there was transport to the strip for a fee but then it stopped again. We did use it, but we had one occasion when it let us down - but I think it is better to provide some transport as taxis are expensive. We also used the local bus service which is cheap enough, but again not awfully reliable. I would say the hotel has cut costs - which is understandable in the current climate, but it was noticeable. The first thing we noticed was there is nobody to help with luggage - not a problem if they had automatic doors - but they dont. It was a long way to haul your luggage without any assistance. Also the conceirge staff seemed very inexperienced and had no local knowledge - which is obviously quite important. They can book trips etc - but added nothing to the process. There is no free wi-fi, but you can just walk across the road to Starbucks for this, or also the restaurant (Steiners) also just across the road. I would say they hotel are missing a trick here, because guests were going to the facilities over the road and spending money, whereas if their was free wi-fi on the resort, they would have probably spent more money there. We found the restaurants to be poor - the service rather than the food. We only had breakfast and dinner there once - that was enough. Again, I think this is maybe where they have cut costs. It was adequate - but no more than that. The resort was very clean and tidy and the grounds well maintained.

We had stayed here through my bf's work for free but they still charge $20 something total for 3nights for service charge. Location: this hotel was off the strip 10-15min from the Las Vegas (locally). It's near the Las Vegas Premium outlet which is down the street 5min away. Plenty of familiar restaurants are near this hotel: chipotle, panda express, chili's, outback, del-taco, food 4 less store. Appearance: By the look of this resort, I think its a little bit outdated and old. The settings is like an Aztec/Mayan type of decor. The elevator is very old looking with carpet on the wall, weird but yea carpet on the wall. Room: I believe every room has their own mini kitchen which includes: a stove, microwave, sink, plates/utensils, fridge, coffee maker, and dining tables and chairs. Pretty much like your home kitchen room. I thought that was pretty interesting in case you want to make food in your own room. Not many hotels have this inside their own room. They have a small living room for you to watch tv outside of your bedroom. The sofa is pretty old looking too. Cancun needs to be renovated for new furtnitures & decor, seriously! BEDROOM: The bed here was nice and comfy. I don't know why every hotel always put some sort of sheet/thin blanket across the end of the bed, probably for decoration. We just like to use it on the floor for walking. T.v. was the old pop out television back in the days, but who cares about tv when you're in vegas, right? BATHROOM: The bathroom has 2 sinks, a toilet, and big bathtub where you can use it like a jacuzi. Plenty of towels in the restroom which was good. I always use those extra one for the floor becaus the floor can be cold sometimes if you walk barefoot. The bathroom was nice and clean. They gave you free tiny bottles of shampoo, lotion, and bar soap. I brought my own shampoo & soap always, including an antibacterial one. I think all hotels should have anti-bacterial hand soaps but I haven't seen them yet. Bring your own just in case you need them. -PARKING: At night this parking can be pack and you'll have to drive around the hotel for extra parking. You just have to walk a little farther to your room. -The door can really be very noisy when closing it, which is something I find kind of annoying. We don't want to disturb other neighbors yet we don't want the noise to disturb us either. -They do have a pool, ice machine, & laundry room. -This place does have ac and heater which was good for hot/cold weather. -They had their own bus to take you to the strip (free) I gave this place a 4 because it was clean and comfortable to sleep and showered in. Mostly when we travel those are the 2 main things that we needed first. The decoration/appearance was yes outdated but it didn't really bother me. I like how there was a full mini kitchen (not many hotel have this). Service was friendly.

(Food 4 Less is across the street) If you want a large kitchen and dining room, buy a vacation house, don't rent a condo. The staff were not the nicest people and could use some more training on friendliness. The nicest people are the room attendants (and the sales people of course).

Unlike the other resorts, it stays open til 10pm, instead of closing at 5pm to try to force you to get in the casinos and gamble. Lounge with ping pong, pool etc. was good as well as the small arcade. Some people have complained about the location of the resort which is 2 or 3 miles south of the action on the strip. People need to research better before booking. That is the whole point of this resort. It is a family oriented resort just far away enough from the action that your kids don't have to see stripper brochures all over the ground when you walk outside, but it's close enough to drive to in less then 5 minutes if you want to be in the middle of the action. We enjoy going to the casino resorts, but also being able to leave it all to a quiet relaxing room. Breakfast (pancakes!) is very good and not too expensive from the restaurant.

Inside the pyramid are water slides which provide lots of fun and challenge for children and the 'young-at-heart' . The beautiful waterfall they advertise so heavily was unfortunately not turned on during our stay. The resort is rectangle-shaped with 2 condo buildings each on either side of pool. The main entrance and lobby are in front and offer nothing to write home about in the way of appearance but check-in was reasonable. This resort sits approximately 3 miles south of Mandalay Bay and 2 miles south of Town Square. There's a Food-4-Less, a CVS and some restaurants across the street which you can access on foot. There's no free shuttle to the \"Strip\", however, so you'll need to pay $9 each way or take a very expensive taxi. You are much better off renting a car on Priceline. Parking and Security Outdoor parking spaces are plentiful and there is a ground-level garage beneath each building. Valet units are readily available for guests to use to move luggage and other items in and out of buildings. The only way to enter the buildings, however, is through the parking garage at the ground level or through the secured gates and up a ramp (no stairway) to Level 1. There is no ground level entry other than the parking garage. If you are unable to secure a space in the garage and must park on the exterior you need to march down the ramp right along with the cars and trucks and make your way to the entrance. Having no pedestrian walkway makes this a very dangerous resort for children. Perhaps this is the reason for the propensity of very harsh speed bumps throughout the resort. You will need your key card to enter anywhere but the main lobby so don\u2019t leave home without it. Security is a big deal here. Accommodations We stayed in a 2-bedroom condo in the Tulum building. The furniture is very outdated and fairly beaten up. This miniscule condo had an overall appearance of being cheaply thrown together. The provisions were sparse particularly in the kitchen which is nothing more than a tiny nook. The carpeting is cheaply laid and heavily stained. The rooms are all much smaller than other timeshares we've frequented. The teensy kitchen is very poorly equipped and there are no drawers. The silverware is kept in a holder inside a cabinet and the cookware and utensils provided are sparse and just don't make sense. For example, there is a steak knife set but no good way to prepare steak. Don't plan on cutting up fruits or vegetables because there is no appropriate knife for this. You get a very cheap serrated knife and that's it. There are a few tabletop appliances: blender, toaster, and coffeemaker. Major appliances include a stove, microwave, small dishwasher and a refrigerator which is small and very flimsy (no icemaker) but it works. We were provided with two ice cube trays but no bin. There is one ice machine on each floor but isn't of any use if it's not working. There is also one washer and dryer on each floor for which you will need quarters. If you don't have enough you'll have to go out to the restaurant and ask for change, as there are no change machines available anywhere. The balcony is decent but sparsely furnished. We had to call for an additional 2 chairs to accommodate our party of four. My overall reaction to these condos is that they are pulled together cheaply and haphazardly. Amenities It's a shame that so many things just don't work here. I needed to call for help with the washer because the coin slot was stuck. The dryer was also difficult. We couldn't run the microwave and the Jacuzzi simultaneously without blowing a fuse, another maintenance call. The staff put out a mass voicemail on movie night to let everyone it was cancelled due to \"technical difficulties\". The main pool was closed because the pool heater was in disrepair. They finally had to open it midweek because so many people complained. I think they trucked the water in from the North Pole though. By the end of our week the water finally warmed up enough for adults to use the pool. The restaurant was closed so they were running food orders to the bar at the pool. Children are not permitted inside the bar of course so families had to eat outdoors whether they wanted to or not. The waterslides are really lots of fun for both kids and adults and at least those were open for business! If you could negotiate the freezing water temperature, that is. The facility that functioned the best I thought was the gym. It was equipped with more cardio equipment than most timeshare gyms I've used and all of the equipment actually did work. A property this size should have more than just one small gym, however. Last but by no means least a \"computer error\" randomly checked us out midweek and our room keys all suddenly stopped working at once. Although it was a serious inconvenience at least it didn't occur at 2am. Many of the resort workers are very lovely people and greet you warmly but these are mainly housekeepers and maintenance folk. The timeshare staff absolutely does not do any extra miles for you here even if you're an owner. I understand that the economy is bad and the \"unwealthly\" have more important things to spend their scarce money on than midrange timeshares like Grand Monarch, but timeshare staff needs a lesson in understanding the service industry. Many of the clients at Grand Monarch are paying guests, not freebies on a tour. We're entitled to good service and smiling faces during our stay and if things continually go wrong there should be an acknowledgement. My family will not be returning to this timeshare and I just can't recommend it to anyone when there are much nicer timeshares in Vegas for essentially the same price. If you're already stuck with your reservation and can't cancel I wish you the very best.

We had a getaway certivcate from a vacation ownership organization and were flexible as to where we wanted to stay so this worked out well for us.

We opted to use the shuttle once, and it worked out ok. We had no trouble with any staff the entire stay. We checked in late (we had requested it) with no problem although we heard from others that the lines coule be long during peak times. The staff was freindly and accomodaing with every request we made. We had a minor maintenance issue that was fixed in less than 30 minutes, and housekeeping was very responsive to any request for extras. Being that this is a vacation club resort, there is no daily housekeeping, but that wasn't a big issue for us. The pool are was clean and well maintained and all the staff in the area were easygoing and friendly to deal with. The fact that it was a slat water pool was an unexpected bonus (no heavy chlorine smell and easy on the eyes). The room was spacious (1 BR suite) with a compact but functional kitchen. The shower in the master suite was functional, but was part of a 2 person whilrpool tub so not an issue. There is a second full bathroom off the living room that had a good shower in it so no real problem there. We opted for a quiet view, so were overlooking the pool and out into the mountains. Very little noise from that viewpoint as we could not hear traffic on Las Vega blvd and only the occasional emergency vehicle. I don't think I would opt for the street side view, but that would be a personal choice. The only negative thing I could possibly mention and it was not a big deal was eating in club (we did not use the restaurant - same food just wanted to be by the pool).

Hop on I-15 and that will take you to any location you need to go on the Strip, avoiding many lights and saving time. The POOL: See those photographs of the pool on the website? The pool does look just like that! If you go out to the pool early, you will have it all to yourself. The kiddie side w/ the slides doesn't open until 10am, but the rest opens at 8am. TIP: Pool deck slippery, wear flip flops at all times on the concrete! I managed to slip and break my toe - didn't know until I was all the way back in Rhode Island. Parking: Never a problem with parking. Plenty of spaces. Villa: I had a kitchen, dining room, living room and 2 bedrooms. All of it was spotless and everything in working order. 2 Jetted tubs. Beds were very comfortable, too! Tried them both! Only reason I didn't give and excellent? I was hit with an extra charge upon check in. I've never had to pay anything extra at a timeshare - not even in Las Vegas. It was \"Accommodations Tax\" of 6.93/day. Came to 48.51 for my stay. While it may be Las Vegas that charges this, I guess some of the other timeshares do not pass it on to their customers.", "Date": "October 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cNice & quiet\u201d", "Author": "djohns", "ReviewID": "UR81845354", "Content": "My husband and I exchanged here thru II for a 1 week 2 bdrm condo.

Nothing a good power washing wouldn't fix. It was not a major problem, but something of wich you should be aware. Did not try the restaurants or the bars, but heard from other people that tey were (not unexpectedly) overpriced. The bedrooms were a little small compared to other two bedroom places in which I have stayed, but the bathroms were huge. The bathtub in the master batroom was big enough to accomodate two people very comfortably and while the one in the other bathroom couls easily accomodate two people it was not as roomy. The cloth placemats could probably be replaced as they were various colors of green (different stages of fade) and looked a bit used, but overall the property was nice.

They policed people from bringing beverages & food at two of the pool entrances the first few days but that stopped a few days later. We brought down food and drink each day. The pool side food/bev service was kinda pathetic. Towels are $20 per towel if you don't bring back by 10pm. This was new and explained because they were much nicer towels. My opinion was they were YMCA quality. You do need to get down by 8am to get a good chair as well as pool lounges for the water. The water does have a very strong salty taste to it.

This resort has a beautiful pool ( but more on that later ) and unlike some \"condo resorts\" it's nice that it has a bar and cafe near the pool since some have no poolside amenities. And the rooms are nicely appointed ... we were in a 1 BR and it was nice ... granite, comfortable beds, nice bedding, spacious balcony ... but I suppose because it was intended to sleep 4 ... there were 2 full bathrooms and yet the kitchen was tiny. Space could have been better allocated by offering a decent kitchen and one full bath ... just my opinion. Beyond that ... not much good to say. I have nothing against children, have a few of my own in my family and I realize that kids need a vacation too ... but I was really upset to find out that although this resort's website advertises an \"adult only\" pool ... it's no where to be found. As you will see from pictures, the central point of the pool is a \"Mayan Pyramid\" with waterfall and waterslides. When we first arrived I was immediately tired of all the \"screaming\" of children etc. and I asked the lifeguard where the \"adult\" pool was. She looked at me like I was from another planet and said she knew nothing of it. Later in the week a bartender told me that they initially tried to have an adult pool but couldn't keep the kids out of the waterfall so they gave up. It really IS an issue if you just want to relax. Nothing against kids ... I know they want to have fun ... but when I book a place that says they have an adult pool I don't want to hear SCREAMING kids all day long as they play under the waterfall. Also, there is a hot tub under the pyramid that is supposedly \"adults only\" ... but nobody enforces it so the children run rampant and the hot tub is directly under the waterfall which is exactly where all the children want to play and scream. There is also an \"adult lounge\" with relaxing areas, tv, pool table & internet access ... watch out for the kids though ... they run the place and there doesn't seem to be ANY enforcement at all. I just needed 10 minutes on the computer in the course of the week ... to check emails and make some travel and business arrangements and I could barely concentrate because children were playing pool and yelling and screaming. Next, although this is a timeshare/hotel that says it is your home away from home ... they have a stringent policy that you are not allowed to bring ANY food or drink to the pool area. I partly understand, because if they are going to provide bar/cafe poolside ... they need people to buy stuff. But one of the main reasons many of us go to condos is because we can make a sandwich or cocktail and take it to the pool ... so that was very disappointing. I found it very frustrating that the rules at this resort are enforced sporadically ... what I mean is .... when you come to the pool there are \"guards\" that ask you what is in your beach bag to make sure you don't bring in food or drink .... but when it comes to enforcing any rules about the adult areas ... forget it! The service at this resort is lacking. While I was there, we had a brief power outtage. At the time I was in my room but just leaving for the pool. The power went out as I was in the hallway and it was PITCH BLACK ... no emergency lights ... people were scared and there was literally NO WAY to find your way either to an exit or back to your room. Many of us gathered together and found the stairs ... again no lights in the stairways ... we literally had to \"feel\" our way down 5 flights to the exit. No damage ... but if there had been a fire or otherwise? I tried to talk to \"management\" about it .... but they didn't care. I was told that it wasn't their fault ... the \"exit\" and emergency lights were supposed to be powered by the \"back up\" generator, but it didn't kick in. So again ... it wasn't their fault. The \"lifeguards\" at the pool do little, other than blow their whistles and enforce the food and drink policy. I honestly don't think I EVER saw ONE of them get off their stool ... they just shout at people over the din of the waterfall ... which no one seems to hear anyway. Honestly, this resort just needs to decide what it wants to be. It either needs to play up the aspect of being a family resort, which would be great ... expand the family and children activities, dump the bar in favor of an arcade and ice cream shack etc. ... or be a true \"condo/hotel/resort\" where all ages can enjoy.", "Date": "July 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cNot a good place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Notglamourous", "ReviewID": "UR68996426", "Content": "This by far was the worst hotel experience I have ever experienced.

Food was just ok. Nothing spectacular for the price. All in all, compared to the other time shares we have stayed at in vegas, this one wins over Club de Soleil because of the pool size - and rooms are bigger here.

Grand Chateau outshines all of the timeshares because it is the newest and on the strip, only downfall with Grand Chateau - it has a very small pool area, probably the smallest of all.

Upon reading the other reviews, I was worried that I had made a mistake but was I absolutely wrong. We under-estimated our time and subsequently missed our flighted due to the long check-in at Southwest airlines and security. Only one of our party was able to leave on time and arrived earlier than ourselves. She arrived and was recieved by Juvi, the receptionist at Cancun Las Vegas, and allowed to enter our reserved room early to wait before we arrived. The other members of our party were able to arrived later that same day and were shown to the room. I was not able to arrived until the following morning since I was placed on stand- by on Southwest. Upon my arrival, I though wow this is a nice resort. Very clean and the decor is very Mayan, not Aztec, although the pyrimid near the pool Aztec in shape. The pool area is very nice and everyone was very friendly and helpful. I entered our room and boy it was nice and clean. The kitchen is small but was well stocked with cooking utensils and dishes. There was a stove with an oven and dishwasher. Yes it is small but if you need anything bigger than stay home. There was always someone outside taking care of the grounds, pool or building. As for location to the Strip, yes the complimentary resort shuttle starts at 12 noon but take the bus. A 24 hour pass cost $7.00 and can be caught across the street. Just be carefull crossing the street later in the day. Traffic is dense in the afternoon and evening. We crossed the street in the morning and caught the bus to the terminal where we transfered onto the Duece to the Strip. The same bus ticket can be used to get on and off while visiting all the major hotels along the Strip. The bus pass was a money saver and we made it pay off. There is a CVS half a block down to the left where inexpensive souvenirs can be found. Steiner's is a great place to catch a bit to eat. Any the waiters are very friendly, they seem to be ready for a real good time. There is also a Food 4 Less in a little strip mall behind the CVS. Therefore, the location was really great. We even walked to the Target about 2 miles away but needed to take a taxi back. Jamaria called the taxi service three times when the taxi never arrived. She was very friendly and efficient. Never with an attitude nor impatient so I guess the employees refered to in the other reviews must have been fired. My friends loved the Cancun Las Vegas resort so much so they only wished they owned a timeshare to return there. They definitely took lots of pictures and could not be silent to the compliments rendered to the resort. They definitely will share their experience to their family and friend.

We had done a time share exchange and since we are not owners there were only certain rooms/building that we were suppose to be in - we have noted that before on exchanges and sometimes it is the most undesirable room or location that is given. On our move of rooms we saw what a regular room in the oldest building was and it was a huge improvement - almost like we were 2nd class. We did not rent a car as the resort provided a shuttle - make sure you know how it works so you don't get left behind one eveing and don't be in a hurry. One of the outlet stores is about a 20 minute walk away and there are restaurants across the street as well as a large grocery store. Just remember to buy only what you can carry as sometimes the traffic is busy and you have to wait awhile until it is safe to cross - we filled our back packs making it easier. There is a drug store a block away and other strip mall shops across the street as well. If your expectations are not too high this place is fine.

The restaurant food needs revamping, in a big way. They are seriously missing a great opportunity here. Someone from this resport should spend a few day in Mexico and see how they treat their guests and what kind of food/drinks they are serving. My goodness.... It would be great to have fish taco's, tropical salads, fresh fruit & cheese platters offered to guests as they lounge around the pool. Why isn't anyone walking around the pool offering guests signature drinks. Lovely tropical drinks would be delightful. Instead, they had bar food fare; wings, french fries, nachos. The only thing I could find on the menu that wasn't fried was a turkey sandwich, and it was good. We own three timeshares and are able to move them (exchange) to various places all the time.

Room Service - I was very pleased by how affordable this option was and the two times we did order it the food arrived in a very timely manner. Shuttle Hours - Your in Las Vegas .. the strip is why many, many people come - your shuttle should run past 12AM. It would also be nice if they had 1-2 more stops. Perhaps one in the middle or one at the other end of the strip. It's quite a hike in the midday heat. Bathrooms - We liked that our room had 2 bathrooms. One in the Master Bedroom with a shower over a jacuzzi tub, and another off of the living room with just a shower. It makes it great if your traveling with friends you don't want coming through your bedroom in the middle of the night to go to the restroom. CONS: Staff - The staff in general was my biggest complaint. I work for Marriott and in the hospitality industry so I know what I'm looking for service wise - this staff didn't have it. Half the time they passed us off to the concierge who then told us to go ask the front desk. The morning before we left I had 2-3 things to ask the desk agent. Between each of the items (may I have an envelope, may I buy a stamp, can you make this and my Netflix please) the agent left me and went behind a door to continue her conversation with another staff member. The only POSITIVE staff I had interation with was the shuttle staff. Shuttle - It was a good to have the option but could be improved. Room - Kitchen should be larger. Compared to the kitchen at our home resort in Lake Tahoe it was like cooking in a closet. Housekeeping - On the day they were to service our room they knocked, we answered and asked them to return in 5 minutes so we could put on shoes etc. etc to go out while she cleaned. She said ok but when we returned after driving around for 1 1/2 hours our room still wasn't cleaned. I called the housekeeping manager and explained and told them to forget servicing the room as we were checking out 2 days early. 5 minutes later the girl arrived with her cart again to clean the room. We are returning to Vegas in March of 2010 for my 30th birthday but I'll pay to stay on the Strip instead of wasting another timeshare week.

I decided it wasn't that big of a deal and went on. We then proceeded to try to watch a movie only to find the dvd player was broken and making a huge loud popping noise. We called the front desk and they sent someone up. It took him running back and forth to find a new dvd player and an hour to hook it up.

She then hung up and called the front desk to complain of all the issues building up and also to let them know of the panels that are coming off the wall near the balcony of our wonderful view of the parking lot. They said it being memorial day weekend they could only move us to another room and have no other sister hotels to send us to or rooms to upgrade us to. We had to then pack up all of our belongings and groceries we had bought for a week and move everything to a completely different building. The hotel did not even offer to help! They only thing they could do to make up for it was a dinner off site (we refused to eat at their horrible restaurant). Which when it came time for us to get our vouchers and go to dinner they were not at the front desk. So they had to track down the GM to get them. All the while we missed the shuttle and had to pay for a taxi! We also had her comp us a few drinks at the pool but she was not happy about having to do both. Our room had two bathrooms, so one bathroom was shared by four people. Knowing this, housekeeping still only gave us enough towels for two people. The bedrooms do not have any fans and the air barely worked in our room so my husband and I sweat it out every night. We had the ac on the lowest it would go but still nothing! After sleeping in our new bed my husband and I both noticed we were itchy. We didn't think much of it until after the next night when we were both bright red and covered in hives. We had welts all over our bodies that itched like crazy! I called to the front desk and they said we must just be allergic to their detergant and that it wouldn't help to get new sheets. It did not seem very likely to us that we were both allergic to the same detergant and that we were fine in the first room but not his one! I told her to send the sheets anyways. When we got home we noticed they brought new sheets but rather than put them on they just left them on the table near the door! After we put the new sheets on the day we left we finally started to get better. The shuttle was nice to have but only runs until midnight. So you do not get a ride home if you plan on going home late. All the drivers had different rules and if there were a lot of people waiting you had to wait for the next time which could be an hour. A taxi back to the hotel is a minimum of $20 but will often run you double that with the traffic. We had to use the taxi more often then planned because they had one shuttle broke down so rather than the 15 min wait time they advertise, you wait more like 30. I will say that they nicest people we came across were two of the shuttle drivers. The restaurant at the pool is awful. They are incredibly overpriced. The chicken wings were very over priced and I must say the worst I've ever had. The frozen margaritas out of the machine were great though. But did cost you $12. The pool is large and has water slides but it got extremely crowded on the weekend. There were not enough chairs for people, but plenty of room where they could have bought them. I guess the hotel was too cheap for that. We had six people in our room but were only allowed to check out one pool float per room! They had a cookout for the weekend that we decided to purchse food from. We went to the food only to find you must go to the restaurant on the other side of the pool area to stand in line to purchase tickets then come back to the food to stand in line to get your food! We did this and when it was our turn to get our food they ran out!! They were not sure if they would get anymore, but finally came up with some 30 minutes later. The only reason we were able to get food was because we happened to walk up and check to see if any was there right before it had once again run out. The organization and planning of this hotel is a disgrace. After staying at this hotel I will NEVER purchase a timeshare. I will NEVER EVER recommend this hotel to ANYONE! This is the worst hotel on the market. I am highly disappointed. Especially after reading so many great reviews. I could go on and on about how much this hotel ruined our trip but I will stop. I think you get the point. It was awful and completely ruined our trip. Oh and my husband and I just finally got our hives, redness and severe itching to go away today...one week after being home!

As many have said, the rooms are a little dated, but roomy and comfortable, especially great with having a baby with us. We never used a shuttle as our son had his car with him. The drive into town was quick and easy. The airport, grocery store, several restaurants, and shopping were conveniently close. We were happy to find a washer & dryer in our building. Something to be aware of, some 2-bedrooms have a Queen bed in the 2nd room, some have 2 twin beds. We were NEVER approached about touring or purchasing a timeshare - we were pleasantly surprised about that. If I were to point out any negative, it would be the main bathroom. The shower head was badly in need of a vinegar soak so there would be decent pressure and waterflow. A lightbulb was out in the bathroom - took about 4 calls to get someone there to replace it. The pool area is probably the biggest plus for the Cancun. There was pleasant music playing, there were several hammocks to lay with the baby for a nap, and ample tables and chairs.

We were pleasantly surprised at our room. I had requested a pool view, not only did they make sure we had that, it was on the top floor with one of the best views you can get of the resort! Sure, the rooms are dated a little. That didn't matter to us though. The staff at the resort was very nice and we were not approached one time about the timeshare bit. We were kind of on guard about that. One of the resturaunts was closed which also didn't matter much. The Caribe lounge did the trick. Really we just used that for snacks and drinks. We only wish they had a swim up bar, we may not have spent as much time laying in the chairs getting burnt!!!! So, I only have one complaint about the resort and it's not really something that they can control.... There is a rule about no outside food and drink in the pool area, they were pretty relaxed about that rule as long as you were bringing your drinks in plastic cups. As the day went on, we noticed one VERY LARGE FAMILY that had staked their claim on several tables and brought in all of their own food, drinks and stereo!!!!!!!! The resort has great music playing all the time so I don't know what their deal was. I really wanted to say something to the resort staff because I truely felt that this family was detracting from the wonderful ambiance the pool area had. We were there to relax and have fun though so I decided to order another drink and ignore them!!!!!!! I guess that's what it's all about.

We got a pretty nice room with two bedrooms and jacuzzis in both bathrooms. I say jacuzzis, but these things were like two person hot tubs. They were big and deep. They had three TVs, full kitchen, etc. The balcony was huge and had a nice view of the strip even though we wanted a pool view room. In any case, the beds were queens, but we could have used more pillows. Since we did not notice this until about 4 am, we did not bother them with this request. The pool area is beautiful. Although it was a little chilly when we were there, there are two big pools, one with a few large waterslides that looked really fun. I'm sure this is overrun by small children in the warmer seasons. There are five hot tubs including one underneath a waterfall. This is relaxing, but loud and not conducive to conversation. There are others with hammocks around them and what not. Very nice groups with a huge replica of a Mayan pyramid in the middle. No outside food or drink as I was told by my nervous 18 year old lifeguard, because you have to buy theirs from the cafe and/or bar. We just brought ours down anyway and poured it in cups. Everyone else did too, so stop cryin! The fitness center was more of a closet. Nevertheless, I managed to get a very good workout in with the equipment that they have. You just have to think outside the box a little. The thing that bother me though was that the circuit kept blowing for the treadmills, so we had to keep flipping the switch in the circuit box. This probably happened every five minutes when two of the three treadmills were being used simultaneously. As for the location, it is about five miles from the heart of the strip. Not bad for a short drive. The shuttle stops at 12, which pretty much makes it useless as that is when people need a DD. But if you want to avoid the hassles of strip driving during the day then maybe it is worth it. There is not much around, but there is a 24 hour bar across the street if you came to Vegas for that. Not me, but if you are sick of the strip or don't like people, this might be your spot. There are some food options, a food 4 less, and CVS for your convenience. If you have no car, this place would be pretty difficult as I hear cab fares are expensive to the action. I heard that the timeshare people were pretty annoying, but I didn't see any.

But, if you missed the shuttle or decided to spend extra time on the strip, the bus stop was right in front of the resort. We were accessible to many restaurants and stores at this location. We even had the bank that we bank at across the street from us. I had been to Vegas many times and this was my first time not staying on the actual strip and I loved it. It was so quiet and people not running in and out all night and day. There were 2 restaurants on the property and they both had great food. The pool, of my goodness, the pool was fabulous. They also had whirlpools around the property and a hammock section. I am sorry to say that we didn't utilize the spa but, I heard from other guests that it was lovely.

Had some maintance issues, but chose not to deal with them - after all, we were on vacation. Didn't want to deal with people coming in to fix something, so we did without. That was our choice.

The Cancun Resort was Fantastic! We took months to carefully plan our two week holiday in Vegas and we were not disappointed except in one area, which I will get too in a minute! Only one thing was off putting. We watched the reviews of the Cancun, here on Trip Advisor, very closely and at one point even wrote to the head office of the resort because we had concerns. Not only did we get a prompt reply of reassurrance from the general manager of the hotel himself, when we got there we were not disappointed with our room or the resort but the reassurance given by the general manager was not true. We had one bedroom apartment in building number two. Room 2228. It was perfect! I will add our video of the room when we arrived so you can see! The quality of the video isn't great because its taken with my point and shoot camera but you will get the idea! The staff there was amazing! We had an unexpected lay over in Philly because of Tropical Storm Hannah, so when we arrive we desparately just wanted to go to our room and sleep. When we arrived at the Cancun, they had just lost complete power on one side of the resort and told us that we would have to wait to book in as their computer systems had lost power too. After we told them how tired we were and that aren't a new check in, that we should have checked in the day before and that I had called to let them know we had to lay over in Philly, they cheerfully found us a room in about 5 minutes! We got to our room and it was everything we had hoped and more. The concerige desk helped us each and every day with taxi's, info about the area, finding restaurants, walmart, grocery stores and even helped us plan our tours of the Grand Canyon and Hoover Damn! Everyday their was unlimited, knowledgable help with a smile! Our room was cleaned every single day! On the days we left a do not disturb sign on the door, housekeeping would call to make sure that we didn't want our room cleaned or trash taken away or clean towels! EVERY DAY!!!!! The pool area is just as gorgeous as it in the pics online! We enjoyed the pool by day and enjoyed the strip by night. We loved the water slides, well our son did and we loved the many hot tubs! (Especially the one by the hammocks!). They have noodles and really great water beds you can sign out. If you want a water bed get one early about 8:30am. Some life guards only sign one out per room while others sign out as many as a person likes and leaves none for others. Its not very standardised. I just thinks some life guards don't follow the policy of one per room. The water beds were all in great condition. The grocery store across the road was perfect to get our breakfast and lunch groceries from but make sure to take a taxi. It only costs a couple of dollars and it is much safer! As for taxi's make sure to ask for a Deluxe taxi! Don't use any others. Deluxe was the only ones that didn't rip us off! By the end of our first week there we knew our way around and stopped some cabbies from taking us the long way around! Food off the strip is so much better then on the strip! Its worth the few extra miles drive! Speaking of driving! The hotel is only about 10 mintues from the strip. We used the Cancun shuttle most of the time going into the strip. It was timely and comfortable but would definately rent a car next time! Everything is not as close as it looks! If you remember anything about Vegas....remember this! Everything is not as close as it looks! Sooo, to sum it all up! Cancun has th wow facture and is quiet and peaceful. Things do pick up there on Fridays and Saturdays when a lot of day passers come in with their coolers and picnics and kids. The review below about that is true and it was one of the things we wrote to the head office about and while they assurred us it wasn't true, it is! Unfortunately, a fair few of those day passers are less then quality people who respect others space. I do hope I stated that fairly. The only way to improve on our visit to the Cancun would be to stop the day trippers, coolers and picnicers which can make you feel like your vacationing in a trailer park.", "Date": "September 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "lynwood", "Title": "\u201cok\u201d", "Author": "lacoquetita", "ReviewID": "UR20207369", "Content": "well we got to the hotel, when we got their I asked the receptionist if we may have our room, she said check at 1pm so we did and she did not have no room...

This time our room was ready, but they notified us they would be immediately taking out a $100 deposit from our credit card. OK, fine. Proceeding to our room in our car, we first noticed the poorly designed parking situation. There are about 5 buildings in the complex (and they're building more) and each has a semi-underground parking area which holds about 25-30 cars. Everyone else has to park outside. During our week stay, we were rarely fortunate to get an underground spot. The real drawback is that if you park outside, you must walk down the garage parking ramps to get to the elevators to your room. This is extremely dangerous, especially at night. Additionally, the resort attracts a lot of families and this is just not a good situation. There is a card key reader which allows access into the waiting area for the elevators. This door was NEVER locked. Free access for anyone. The waiting area was always very dirty with loose trash. The 2-bedroom condo is smaller than many others we have stayed in except for the bathrooms which are very nice and very large. The kitchen is tiny, about the size of a closet. It does have a refrig, microvave, range, and dishwasher. Very little counter space. The living area is the absolute worst I have ever seen in a time share or condo. There is one sofa and one chair. The sofa is so cheap and uncomfortable that we couldn't sit on it for more than a half hour. Chair wasn't much better. Carpet was torn in several places and stained in others. TV was flat screen, but fairly small. Adequate number of channels, but no pay channels. Bedrooms were OK, but also on the small side. Only one lamp on one side of the bed. Not enough space for the other side I guess. There was a spacious balcony, but was only furnished with two cheap plastic chairs. A/C worked well, and rooms were fairly quiet expect for those slamming their doors in the hallway. Families will love the pool area and schedule of activities available. There is a snack bar under the mayan temple which seemed to do a pretty good business. Staff was nonexistent except for the lifeguards and the periodic time share salesmen. Luckily, we were never solicited. Location at the south end of the strip is OK since your away from the hustle and bustle area. Across the street is a grocery store, irish pub, and a few other stores. You're about 4 miles from Mandalay Bay to the north, about a mile from the Silverton which ir right across I-15, and about 2 miles from the South Point casino resort. They do have shuttle service to the Tropicana.

We had a 1 bedroom/2 bath villa. We liked being off the strip, because it felt more restful. The shuttle service worked great for us, but for some the 12pm to 12:15am schedule wouldn't work well. A taxi from Mandalay Bay to the resort was about $20.00, so it would be a considerable cost if you were out past the last shuttle every night. The rooms were very clean, but the furniture was old. However, the bed was comfortable, and that's the most important thing. I read one review about cockroaches and it scared me, but there wasn't a single bug in our room. I was very impressed with how clean it was. The pool was fun! The water slides are fun even for adults! The only negative thing I have to say about the pool was how salty it tasted. Accidentaly swallowing water or even licking ones lips was not a pleasant experience. All that in consideration, the large pool was a much needed thing in the Vegas heat! Getting groceries from Food4Less was a great way for us to save money. It was just a short walk across the streeet. We ate breakfast/lunch in our room and only ate dinners on the strip. Here's a tip for those who are beginning gamblers... Hooters Casino has $3.00 minimum blackjack tables and it's right next to the shuttle drop off! We were there almost everyday. Don't expect too much from the dealers in way of personality (it's sort of hit or miss) but the low minimum is a great way to learn the game without risking large amounts of money. Fremont Street is also a great place to play lower limit games. Ride the Deuce!!! The bus goes from the South of the Strip all the way to Fremont street. A one way ticket is $2.00, but a 24 hour pass is only $5.00. Once we learned about this, we didn't take another taxi unless it was an absolute necessity. This is by far the cheapest way to get around on the strip. Walking is often just a little too far. It's not the fastest transportation though, because it makes so many stops... but it worked for us. The bus that goes from the South tip of the Strip past the Cancun resort stops at 1am, so it's not a good way to get back to the resort.", "Date": "September 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Herts, UK", "Title": "\u201cWORKED A TREAT FOR US!\u201d", "Author": "ellives", "ReviewID": "UR18829181", "Content": "2 adults 2 young kids.

The bathrooms were beautiful, the one off the master had a wonderful double jacuzzi tub. The room itself was on the small side, barely enough room for the king sized bed in the bedroom, and when the couch was folded out, it took up the entire living room. That was okay though, we weren't there to sit in our room. I booked this hotel specifically for the pool. It is huge with 4 waterslides. Since it is over 100 degrees in Vegas at this time of year, I knew we would sit by the pool by day and go into town in the evening. On Friday morning we went down to the pool , got a nice spot with a hammock, and checked out a couple of rafts from the equipment room. The rafts were completly falling apart, but they were great for floating around the pool and reading. It was so nice a peaceful, all of the pool chairs never filled up! One problem, someone pooped in the main pool mid-afternoon and the pool was closed for the rest of the day. Saturday morning, we went down to check out the rafts and the lifeguard told me they weren't checking the rafts out (although they sat in a stack on the floor). She said the rafts were in such bad shape they were sending them back and would have no rafts until the replacements came. I informed her that we had used the rafts the day before, and agreed they were in bad shape, but that we didn't mind, we would like to use them anyway. She refused. I then told her that i had brought my own raft, it was in the car, could I use mine. Absolutely not , I was told , NO OUTSIDE toys or rafts allowed. After speaking with the assistant general manager of the hotel, we were allowed to use their rafts for the day. Sunday-the rafts have left the building. No rafts to be had! I figured that was okay. As the day wore on we noticed how crowded it was getting at the pool, it appeared to be local families, all with 5 or more children and ALL were bringing their own noodles and blow up rings !! I couldn't believe how the rules had CHANGED ! I felt like I was at a public pool in Tijuana! We payed good money for our room and I know the owner pays a decent maintenence fee for his timeshare, it is such a shame that the management of this hotel would let it turn into such a mess.

The reason is because I read up so much on the city that I could tell you almost anything. For example, my family couldn't believe that I could drive around town (my first time) and know exactly where I was and where I was going. Well, I had some opinions about Las Vegas that were totally blown away when I stayed at the Cancun resort for four nights/five days. I'll put it to you this way, from now on, I'm going to try my hardest to stay at Cancun (or similar) when traveling to LV. Yes, you're off strip. Technically you're still on Las Vegas Blvd, but the strip is about 4 miles to the north. But this didn't stop any of us from seeing shows, shopping, or doing all the tourist things that the strip has to offer. in fact, I'd say it was almost easier to do all these things because if you know your way around town, you can get there much quicker (and cheaper) than you can just by going up and down the strip taking a cab or the Duece (bus). One big secret that novice travelers might not know is that you can take side streets to get to the various hotels. In fact, I happened to come across a Las Vegas legend when he was going to his car at one of the hotels, and this would have never happened if I was just out with the lemmings. The pool here is the best we've ever seen or experienced. There are better pools out there, but few would be in Las Vegas and even fewer would be located in a residential setting. In other words, pools better than this cost you money to go... get it? Mandalay Bay would be the only residential pool that I'm aware of that would be comparable, but you'd have to fight their thousands of guests whereas at the Cancun Resort, it's so tranquil that you can literally lie in a hammock and read in the shade. To do anything similar at any other hotel would require that you pay for and reserve one of their cabanas.... but at Cancun, this comes with your stay. I used to manage a waterpark, and the water slides here were enough to get me to swim in their pools. The high slide was the fast kind and surprisingly long relative to other slides of its genre at different parks. This is also included with your stay. Many of us rode the waterslide and we ranged from about 22 yrs old to about 55+ yrs old. This would be fun for kids and adults alike. The Cancun is located just across from a grocery anchored retail center. The grocery store is Food4Less and I've generally found their name suitable to their prices. A little ways down the street (maybe another block) is a gigantic strip mall complete with fast food, casual dining (Chipotle, Chilis), steak (Outback) and outlet malls (Tommy, etc). You will feel happy that you get to eat well locally. The food is also cheaper than what you pay on the strip... I know this for fact because I did a price comparison at the same restaurants. For 3 nights we were in a basic 2 room suite. I had the smaller of the two rooms and it was adequate. Our bed happened to be a bit uncomfortable, but the other bed in the suite was nice. The final night we stayed in a presidential suite. It was perhaps about 1500 SQFT complete with large screen TV, Bose sound system and each room was equiped with enormous jetted tubs. The two room standard also had a large jetted tubs, but the presidential ones were larger. In fact, the master bathroom had a tub approximately 330 gallons big. I'd guess you could fit 3 people in it fairly easily... but don't get any ideas, I didn't do that! ;-) They have a pool hall & business center, but I didn't really check out the additional ammentities. Cancun's poolside drinks were reasonably priced ($5 for a mixed drink) and the whole family enjoyed a board game sitting pool side in the shade. Yes, such a thing can happen at Cancun (but don't try this at your local strip hotel because it will never work). All in all, I think I was spoiled by this experience and from now on, I will be looking to stay off strip. It's soooooooooo much better! You can actually enjoy the best of both words by staying in a place like Cancun... luxurious and quiet (not even the people at Four Seasons in LV get this) and 5-10 minutes from the center of the strip via a car.... BONUS REVIEW: In all of Las Vegas, their pools close alarmingly early (7pm). They want you out the pool and out spending money. At Cancun, the pool hours are extended to 10 pm. There's nothing better than swimming on a warm night. It's my favorite time to swim! Second, if you're into waterslides, I'll tell you how to get the most velocity out of them. It's all about body position. Like I said, I worked at one and had a lot of time on my hands in my younger days to figure out the optimal way to ride. To achieve maximum velocity, you want to lie as flat as possible and then arch your back slightly so that your weight is supported by your heels and your shoulder blade area. WIthout that extra friction from your torso, you will absolutely fly... in the pictures, you will see my brother riding normally and then you will see me. The difference is that when I exit the the tube, I'm going so fast that I literally launch to the other side of the pool where the steps are. My brother (and everyone else that goes a normal speed) stops about 10 to 15 feet from the stairs... Enjoy your stay at the Cancun Resort!!!!", "Date": "June 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cLoved Cancun!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Angelica F", "ReviewID": "UR16472246", "Content": "We booked this place through an exchange with my timeshare.

Keep in mind again that this was Spring Break and many times there were people left behind by the shuttle because it didn't run often enough to accomodate everyone.

There were complimentary cookies and water at the reception area. Shuttles to and from the strip (Tropicana) ran past midnight. Since it was winter and the low temps were in the 30s, the swimming pools were closed but I saw kids in the heated jacuzzis. Housekeeping was very limited (once a week?) so re-use your towels (call room service to request fresh ones) and throw your garbage in the bins located in the basement parking. The self-service baggage trolleys were quite helpful. The advantage of a timeshare suite versus the hotel is having the kitchen which allows you to wake up late and eat in (kitchen small but functional.) This is not only convenient but also economical. We loaded up on groceries at the Food 4 Less across the street for $50 and that took care of our breakfasts, snacks and brunches for 4 days. Next to Food 4 Less were restaurants and stores including Starbucks and Panda Express.

The front desk told me to come down and get started on paperwork for a new room. No apology, no nothing. We got a new room, which was smelly, dirty, and faced the parking lot. My cockroach room at least had a nice poolside/courtyard view. Refused the room and was told there was nothing else he could do for me until the manager arrived at 9am. Mind you it was about 4am now and that meant sitting around for 5 hours. There were 5 of us girls who went away for a \"girl\u2019s weekend\" and now in our pajamas with hardly any sleep we were stuck to wait in the lobby until 9am. I suppose we could have gone back to our cockroach room, or the dirty new room but considering the money we spent I felt we deserved better. We got kicked out of the lobby by security at 6:30am because the hotel didn't want people checking out or checking in to see us. We went to breakfast and Walmart to kill time and buy one of the girls some new clothes. I realize this was her choice, but she had a full blown anxiety / panic attack when she saw the roaches on her things. She left 75% of her belongings in the cockroach room because she could not even handle bringing them home with her. She spent $100 at Walmart to get through the last 2 days of our trip. When we got back we were given a long overdue apology, 1 free meal for all 5 of us at the cafe on the grounds (which served sandwiches and frys), no compensation to my friend who bought new clothes, and the best of all... another 3 hour wait out by the hotel pool in our pajamas while we waited for people to check out so we could get ANOTHER new room! I will never go back here, nor will any of my friends. For the price that we paid and the fact that our building was a time share I thought we would not have had any problems. I am extremely disappointed with how our situation was handled. The disrespect we were shown from the front desk, the nonchalant attitude the manager took with us, and the lack of compensation for our inconvenience and experience screams of poor management. Next time I will handle my own arrangements because when I phoned Expedia for assistance I spent most of 90 minutes on hold only to be told that they could not do anything until the manager arrived either. Of course they could have found us a new hotel, but we would have had to pay for it. In my experience a well run business should always have someone on duty who can make decisions to alleviate a problem, no matter what time of day it is. I guess we can all chalk it up to \"live and learn\". I will be following other travelers\u2019 advice more closely and sticking with \"big name\" hotels in Vegas.

I found some of the uncomplimentary reviews and began to worry. Well I want to put anyone's mind to rest who has the same thoughts. This resort is awesome. It is off the strip and thus quiet. The staff were always attentive and helped us whenever we asked. Our 2 bedroom unit was spotless, well equiped and we actually used the kitchen and 2 of us were in there at once. Everything that I needed was stocked in the kitchen and there is a Food 4 Less right across the street for supplies. The one hard thing was transportation. There is no shuttle from the airport so you need to get a cab, or one of the CTS (?) airport shuttles. There is a CanCun shuttle which takes you to the Tropicana, and the South Point Shuttle also comes by. There is a trolley which comes by fairly often and you can get a day pass $4.25 or a night pass $4.25 but you have to transfer several times and it can be time consuming. If you aren't on a schedule it is very easy to get around. Leave plenty of time tho if you have a time schedule. The pool was beautiful. There was always somewhere to sit and they had good towels and a nice little store for sundries and souveniers (fair prices). They had lifegaurds there until 10 PM. A couple of the hot tubs were a little cool, and I would have liked the hot tubs to be open later. The restaurant is fairly generic, but we had room service several times and the food was great. I had a salmon dinner which was one of the best I have ever had. The concierge was helpful and had answers to all our questions. The front desk staff were welcoming and check in and check out was a breeze. The lounge is well staffed and has food available later than the restaurant. The bartenders are all great. There is a exercise room and a full service Day Spa. Both are on site and it isn't hard to get an appointment. Each building has available guest washing facilities. We were in the main building, which is the oldest building and had a view directly towards the pool. The room and resort were so comfortable and relaxing that we spent alot of time right there. One other item that people complained about was the A/C and ours was great. The spa tubs were wonderful and there was ample hot water to actually use them.

The entire resort is untidy, bordering on dirty and unkempt. The air conditioning and water systems are decrepit and noisey. The service level provided by the employees is casual to say the least. Our unit was advertised for six people but the sleeping accommodation was not large enough for sleeping six adults due to the limited available space and absence of sufficient storage space for clothing. The kitchen area was far too small and not sufficiently equipped for six people. When the inventory was checked numerous items were missing and not replaced when requested. There were strange artificial plants dotted about which were dusty, had pieces falling off and took up too much space. The furniture was old and I have seen better in a charity shop. The blinds did not close properly and let in light from the balcony light which came on automatically every evening and could not be turned off. The linen and towels had definitely seen better days. After our first night there we had to change rooms because we could not sleep due to the noisy air conditioning and water rushing through the pipes. We were told by a completely disinterested member of staff at 3am there was nothing they could do about it and speak to the manager in the morning! They obviously thought that if they were awake why shouldn't we be!! The second room was no better because 2 people could not sleep in the lounge area due to the noise again from the a/c and the fridge/freezer. Both of our rooms were in the Merida building which we were told was a new block, god knows what the inside of an old block is like. During the weekend we were there the resort was very crowded due to the fact the hotel seems to issue day passes to people to use the pool. Rules for behaviour around the pool and in the public areas are disregarded by these visitors and not enforced by the local management. The pool access gates were never locked and so the pool was open to all comers as well as paying guests. The underground parking is fine but there are only limited number of spaces under each block and when they are gone - the car fries. The lock on the security door from the underground parking in the Merida building was broken so any non resident could access the inside of block without having to use a pass key. We checked in on 1 June for a week but left after 3 nights and went to the Marriott Chateau. It cost us big bucks but we did not fly nearly 11 hours across the Pond to stay in this kind of hotel it would have completely ruined our week.", "Date": "July 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cMoney Spent On Pool....Not Rooms...\u201d", "Author": "Porosity", "ReviewID": "UR8016049", "Content": "This place is nice from the pics posted on the Interval website, though upon arriving and after inquiring we found out the room pics on the site are of the Penthouse Suite, not their regular rooms. We stayed in building 4 the Yuccatan (aptly named). The place is a dump! They appeared to have spent all of their funds on the pool area and left the rooms alone. To begin with, there is no a/c working in the elevators, for the whole week not a bit of a/c in any of them. Of course when you took the elevator to view the penthouse suite on the presentation that a/c worked just fine. The room is billed on Interval has having a kitchen, it should be a LK instead of K. The kitchen is extremely small, only large enuf for one person at a time, and if someone wants in the frig or oven you have to step out of it so they can open the door. The dishwasher rack was broken, the door that holds in the powders wouldnt stay shut. There was very few utensils, plates, bowls, etc in a place that is suppose to accomodate 6 people. Basic kitchen supplies like soap had not been restocked. Food under the kitchen table, someone did not vacuum under there. The living room was lacking furniture again for a place that says it will accomodate 6 people, had 1 chair and 1 small couch. The place is very dark, whoever put in the canister lights in the ceiling put them all 3 in a row on one side of the rooms only in each room leaving the rest of the room dark. The master rooms mind blinds had weights on the strings from where they had been retied so much, the strings were off the slats and they didnt close completely which left it very bright in there at night cause there is a huge light right outside the window that comes on at night that you cannot turn off! The master is small with a king bed, though seems more of a queen size to us but the night stands are huge things with huge clunky lamps and lampshades from a gone by era that take up most of the room. A corner ent.center takes up what little space is left. The shower is awful, its large, largest I've ever seen though didnt matter when opening a Pepsi gets you more pressure than this shower has, you have to stand directly under it to feel anything and I'm sure a few days I never got wet at all.. The bathrooms are extremely long though for what reason we dont know, it was just wasted space that could of been used for the kitchen, bedroom, anywhere else really. They have huge fake plants sitting around that take up lots of room, we moved all of those to a corner, they added nothing to the decor and were oddly sitting in the strangest places where they were directly hindering you trying to walk to rooms. A ceiling fan when you first enter the room is great, but why not put any in the rooms or living room? You can only turn the heat/ac to off or on, low, med, or high. No picking a temp you'd like and just set it and forget it. A lot of mirrors, if you're into that you wont be disappointed. They put them above each bed, in the hallways to the bedrooms and in the eating area behind the kitchen table. Why is anybodys guess. None of us were keen on watching ourselves eating in the mirror...lol There are no baking pans, only a couple old pots and pans that are not non stick and 2 sizes of pyrex dishes, thats it. We had to wash utensils just so someone else could eat, and there are no drawers in the kitchen, all of the utensils are up in the cabinets, thats how small this kitchen is...no dang drawers..LOL I would not recommend this place. If you can avoid it, please do at all costs. On the other hand, all of their money has gone into the pools and waterslides area which I was told is very nice, I didnt personally go check them out.

The furniture looks like it was picked up at a yard sale in need of lots of TLC. The kitchen is super small, the only plus is the bathrooms. They are huge, they probably could have cut them in half and made bigger closets. The closets are teenie tiny. The food in the cafe is descent, priced okay. The place does not have a business center that lets you use a computer and printer. The major complaint was that the shuttle service realy sucks. They're tiny shuttle vans some with working a/c that only seat 13 people. Everytime we went to get in line there was already about 10 if not more waiting; so we'd get a cab, which we always had to get 2 cabs. Pricey if you multiply this times 7 days. The worst is trying to get a shuttle for the airport.

You need a car anyway, if you're planning to do any significant tours of the Strip. The hotel is made up of apartment suites and has something like 4-6 separate buildings (I can't remember the exact number). The theme is mayan, and there's a parklike area in the middle with a mockup of a big mayan temple and a water slide. Great way to keep the kids entertained. We got one of the one-bedroom suites (they have two-bedroom ones as well). It had a small full kitchen, one dining room area, one living room area that could convert into it's own bedroom, and the master bedroom. There are two bathrooms, one off the master bedroom that is gigantic with a whirlpool bathtub, and another one off the living room/2nd bedroom.

I can't stress enough how great the staff at the Cancun is! They always work with us on any issues and really do a great job to make sure your experience is fun.

It is always better to go home with all clean clothes than to have to spend a lot of time washing dirty clothes when you get back home. We may or may not use this resort again, mainly because we like to visit many resorts.", "Date": "May 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverton, UT", "Title": "\u201cPoor security; great resort\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4989062", "Content": "I loved the resort but had a latex pillow stolen out of my room by someone in housekeeping (I presume). I admit it...I have to have my very own pillow when I travel.

It was just pillow for heavens sake! Anyway, security wasn't helpful at all in finding the pillow or offering any compensation.
