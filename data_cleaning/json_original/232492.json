This was my first time back since the hotel was remodeled. I brought friends with me, we both had Deluxe Junior Suites, canal views, me on the 2nd floor, them on the 3rd. From the lobby to the room, perfect. Check in was a breeze, front desk staff right on their game, luggage delivered to the room in minutes. Housekeeping was low key, handling both cleaning and turn down without us ever noticing. My favorite bar in town is Freddy's, that being Freddy Heineken, whose family owns the hotel, that has been rebuilt with all the charm. Both Gert, 20 year employee, and Marcel, 10 years, still give the best service in town. Along with the physical remodel, food and beverage has radically changed, for the better. We found ourselves eating often in the hotel. Room service was prompt, food actually still warm! Of course the location is perfect, the view from the breakfast room is of the Amstel, elegant, yet laid back. I used to stay at the Sofitel Grand, 20 visits worth, and I cannot say the same about that remodel, the charm completely gone. We had come from the Connaught in London, which I love, but my friends and I both agreed, L'Europe was at least as good, or better.

We took a taxi from the airport and the cost was just under \u00e2\u201a\u00ac45. This was in a large multi seater and the driver assured us that he would charge the same as a \"standard\" car. As the cost going back was about the same and it was then \"rush hour\" this seemed to have been the case. Going back we booked the taxi ourselves (TCA as recommended by other reviewers) and it arrived in about 10 minutes from our call. The hotel staff throughout were very friendly, efficient and helpful, although we had done a lot of research and had planned our trips out, so I do not think we needed much help on that aspect. We had booked a junior suite with a canal view, and this room was absolutely fine in terms of size, view and facilities and as we had expected. We were offered an upgrade for an extra \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300, but declined this. The bed was very comfortable and the nespresso machine was a welcome addition, although a small kettle would have been useful to make tea, rather than having to use water from the nespresso which had a coffee taste. The complimentary bottled water was a nice touch. The lighting on the wardrobe side of the room is not very bright though, so not easy to see inside. Occasionally the room was cold on returning after a day out, so it is possible that this may have been on a timer? The bed was very comfortable, although like other reviewers the automatic lighting system was a bit strange - difficult to read in the bathroom if the lights suddenly go out. Perhaps a simple guide for the room basics might help here! Also as has been mentioned the internet access was at times a bit slow, and on one occasion non-existent.. We ate in the brasserie on two evenings and the service and food was very good, we also had some excellent cocktails in Freddy's bar. The wine list in the brasserie contained many choices that were expensive, but amongst these were a handful of perfectly acceptable wines at a reasonable price for the quality hotel that it is. Breakfast was OK, a nice range, but the cheese and meat on one morning were a little \"tired\" looking, but it was our latest start and no doubt would have looked better earlier on. Housekeeping were too efficient, in that any bathroom product that had been opened seemed to be replaced on a daily basis. If these are discarded it is wasteful and unnecessary. We bought 2 Holland Passes (5 entries each) at a total of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac88. We were left with 2 windmill passes, but even so after visiting the Van Gogh and Rijks museums, the new and old church, the Hermitage and doing a canal tour, we still got our money's worth. Of these our favourite was the Hermitage (and also had a good lunch there). I think we would have visited all regardless of whether we had the pass, so it was not a question of \"we must get our money's worth\". We also visited the Anne Frank house which is not in the Holland Pass, but very worthwhile and attended the free concert on Wednesday lunchtime at Concert Gebouw - extremely popular even in early March and I do not think there were any spare seats, not sure if this was due to the quality of the performance, the fact that it is free, or that it was pouring with rain - however we enjoyed it. The disappointing visits were the two churches, the old as it was being renovated and those parts that were visible were not all that impressive and the new as the exhibition it contained effectively meant that you could not really see the building itself all that well. On the subject of food we had a good lunch at Ristorante Pizzeria Isola Bella at Thorbeckeplein and also at Cafe de Jaren just down the road from the hotel. Overall we enjoyed our visit to Amsterdam, we think the length was about right for seeing the main attractions that we wished to see and it is a good city to walk around - mostly flat, with just the occasional bridge over a canal having an incline! One final point, as we wanted to travel from Bristol we flew with easy jet and paid for speedy boarding - going out was fine, but coming back they did not differentiate between those who had paid extra for SB and those who had not, so it was a waste of money paying the extra.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, but substandard internet makes it difficult for business\u201d", "Author": "fiddleleaf", "ReviewID": "UR125376692", "Content": "While the hotel was quite luxurious, it is not the best choice for business travelers. I was disappointed in the internet access -- only wireless access was available, and the signal was unstable and poor. At times the internet was very slow and not really usable. Definitely disappointing, given the price range of this hotel. The internet connection was too slow for a good remote connection to my office network. I would have really preferred a wired connection. I heard that the hotel had recently been renovated, and it was indeed beautiful. My room was decorated in red and black (very Dutch), with a spacious white marble bathroom. There was ample closet space and a huge bed. Although the room was a nice size, the desk was very small and cramped. It was difficult to do any work at this desk. The service was generally excellent and responsive. The room service menu was on the hotel's website, which you access on the provided iPad. You can also order using the iPad, something that they recommend. However, you still have to call for the soup and dessert of the day, something that they should be able to update on their site daily. Since I had to call for this information anyway, I always wanted to order while on the phone. They would politely request that I put in my order on the iPad, but I didn't understand why I should bother going back to the iPad when I had someone on the phone to take my order. In addition, every time the iPad sleeps (after 10 minutes of inactivity or so), you have reconnect to the internet service provider through the hotel website. This might be understandable for your personal computer, but for the iPad provided by the hotel, it was a nuisance. It would be like having to log in to the hotel's TV service before watching TV, instead of just turning the TV on. Overall, I would recommend this hotel if you don't expect to do any work while in town.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel and amazing staff\u201d", "Author": "EvansSullivan1921", "ReviewID": "UR125361775", "Content": "i do not often feel compelled to write glowing reports about hotels or the service that i have experienced although after our stay at the De L'Eroupe i really feel i should comment in the hope that others travelling to Amsterdam experience the same quality of service from the De L'Europe hotel as we did. My boyfriend and i have just returned from the De L'Europe hotel. We have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world and i can honestly say that this hotel is one of the best we have ever stayed at. Not just due to the hotel but mainly the wonderful staff employed by the hotel. Nothing was too much trouble and everyone from our driver to the waiting staff had a unique quality of making you feel very special. From the moment i booked the hotel the guest relations team were fantastic. Titta in particular was extreamly helpful. Titta organised a wonderful room that overlooked the river and was simply stunning. I received a pre booking form asking some basic information including what temp we would like the room and what pillows we would like. Not many hotels offer such options pre check in. On our arrival at the airport our driver called my mobile to check we had arrived safely and to confirm where we were in the airport. He was waiting for us with a huge smile and a hand shake. It was a welcome start to a lovely weekend. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted with the concierge manager who couldnt have been more helpful. We arrived quite early and were given a room to freshen up and change as our room would not be ready until a little later that day. This was such a lovely gesture as most hotels would only offer luggage storage! On returning to the hotel a little later that morning, Titta who i made the booking with came and personnally showed us to our room this again was such a lovely touch. We were shown to our stunning room where rose petals were left on the bed and in the bathroom. All rooms have Ipads and docking stations adding that little extra comfort and facilities to the rooms. There was a welcome gift on our arrival of a bottle of wine on ice. The food and service in each of the restaurants were faultless. Ralph from the Promenade is truly an asset to the De L'Europe hotel, his friendly nature and manner make you feel as if you have made a lifelong friend. The management team must have searched the whole of Amsterdam for such wonderful staff. its very rare that you find a hotel that is stunning and has the staff to match but i can honestly say that from the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty.

The hotel was fabulous! We booked a Junior Suite with a river view and found it to be perfect for our needs. We travel a lot on business and prefer a living room separate from the bedroom. That is exactly what our junior suite provided without the full suite price. The ceilings in our suite were high, and combined with the river view really added so much to the room. The bed was amazingly comfortable. The bathroom was beautiful - done completely in blue mosaic tiles - not marble like everyone seems to be doing these days. Well lit, excellent water pressure and the tub was a dream! Other reviewers have commented on the internet connection, but we experienced no problems. The Bose system even played our US dvds which was terrific at the end of the day. The location of the hotel is wonderful - located in a charming neighborhood and central to so many of the things you will want to see, but quiet enough to relax. But it was truly the staff that made our stay so wonderful. The check in was smooth and charming. The bell staff was helpful (showing us the controls for the room) and efficient. The concierge was great - made us reservations at a romantic restaurant for our special dinner and helped me ship items home to the US (customs paperwork is so annoying). The delightful reception staff gave me clear directions a couple of times that made finding odd things (like super glue) a snap.

The bed in my room was enormous, and the bathroom is luxurious. My room had a little balcony, just big enough for one person to sit on a chair and relax and enjoy the view of the canal, which was fabulous. The staff were very polite and helpful. The pillows were large and comfortable. Bath robes were luxuriously heavy. The bathroom was wonderfully appointed with numerous towels of many sizes, which I liked. One thing they definitely got right here is the towel supply in the bathroom- I didnt count exactly, but there were on the order of 15 big towels in the bathroom. Perfect! I like to take several baths during the day when relaxing on vacation, especially after I've been out walking in the hot summer sun. The housekeeping was pristine. They spent 30 minutes to an hour each day cleaning up the room, vacuuming the floors, putting everything into pristine condition. Very pleasant and refreshing. Glitches - one of these for me was the internet. If you don't care about the quality of the internet access and only need to occasionally check some emails, skip the next few paragraphs. If you need good internet service for work-related or personal reasons, this is an important thing to know about this hotel. Wired internet access is not available, though the telephones in the room were IP telephones, with \"Ethernet\" ports marked on the side. I plugged a cable in to this port but could not get a connecton; when I asked about it, I was told these ports were inactive and only wireless is available. This means that the hotel has a working intranet, which is how the phones work, and they *could* turn on the Ethernet ports on the telephones with minimal expense if they wanted to. However, they have chosen not to. Wired internet would be useful for many guests, who have devices that require a wired connection, or for when the wireless signal is not fast enough. The wireless internet seems to be capped at maximum speed of 1 megabit per second. Generally, I found my download speeds to be around 0.7 mbps, sometimes as slow as 0.3 or 0.4 mbps. When I complained about this to hotel management, I was told \"Sorry, there's nothing we can do, if many guests are using the internet at the same time it will become slow.\" This response is way behind the times. If a guest picked up the telephone and got no dial tone, would they say \"Sorry, looks like many guests are using the phone at the same time, so we can't give you a phone line.\" Or if there were no hot water in the morning, \"Sorry, many guests have used hot water this morning, the hotel no longer has any hot water.\" Or if the electricity went out, would they say many guests are using electricity at the same time, there is not enough electricity left for you? This is ridiculous and reflects a very old-thinking mentality about the interwebs. It CAN and IS possible to wire the hotel properly to GUARANTEE each and every room fast internet. I won't get into the details, but this is bread and butter IT work and would actually be quite inexpensive to do. Give me a monthly budget equal to one or two days Checking online, the average home in Amsterdam can get 120 megabit/second internet connectivity by cable modem for 50 euro a month from UPC netherlands. Other service providers offer similar speeds and prices for fiber optic, cable, and DSL connections. Wikipedia states that the Netherlands is tied with Switzerland as the most connected country on the planet, and this hotel is near the Amsterdam city center. They have no excuse for not offering better internet service. Comparing this hotel to other 5-star hotels in Amsterdam, at the Hilton I never had download speeds slower than 6 megabits per second when I stayed there, which was satisfactory. Also, the wireless signal was poor. Since wired internet was not available, it would be important to have good wireless signal. I found that I could not maintain a wireless connection reliably in the bathroom (using iPad in the bathtub) or on the balcony. Even in the room, there were \"good\" locations and \"bad\" locations. I found the best location and did my work there. That's pretty sad, especially when they don't even offer a wired connection. A few other minor things.... The room service menu was sparse, even though the hotel restaurants have lots of items that weren't offered. When I asked for a menu, they suggested I look at the menu on the in-room iPad, which opened a web browser to the menu on the hotel website, which was slow. It was difficult to review the menu as only a certain # of things fit on the screen at any one time, and it was slow switching between categories since the internet connectivity was poor. When I asked for a physical menu, I received a stack of paper that had been printed from a printer. A regular printed menu would be more convenient. Room service quality was also spotty. Several of the dishes were quite tasty and well prepared, but overall consistency and attention to detail were lacking on a few occasions. Once they brought me a cheese platter and a bowl of soup at dinner, without any bread. When I asked for bread, they brought three small and unappetizing rolls, which looked and felt like they had been sitting on a shelf for a few days, and which were insufficient for soup and a cheese tasting platter. They also delivered an ice cream dish along with a big meal which was melted by the time it was time to eat it. Couldn't they think of some measure to prevent this, put it on ice, deliver it later, put it in some form of insulation? Anyway the hotel is overall quite beautiful, gorgeous rooms and generally excellent service, but with a few glitches. They need to bring room service up to snuff, with a larger variety of things to order and better attention to detail. And, the internet service is far behind the times, especially for a hotel of this caliber.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201c5 Star Treatment at this Beautiful Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "urbanetraveler", "ReviewID": "UR116760152", "Content": "We just returned from the most AMAZING stay at the beautiful De L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Europe.

This will soon be the very best hotel in Amsterdam....after they tweak a few things following my visit. It is already the best hotel in Europe for a grand English Afternoon Tea (with a twist) by a long way. Forget about any criticism you may have read in posts below. What these posts don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain is that the new, refurbished Hotel De L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Europe has only been open for three weeks. Posts from last month and before were reporting on the building next door which was temporarily in use. Everything in the newly opened hotel is brand new. Reception is new, the restaurants are new, all of the furniture is new....and they are 95% of the way to being totally perfect. My only problems were at breakfast and at check-out but I doubt anyone else will have similar problems as I brought them to the attention of management who paid very close attention. The central location of this privately owned hotel is superb and perfect for everything. The new bedrooms are all superb, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen four of them, all equally good. Our suite was missing a room service menu; a DO NOT DISTURB sign and stationery......as a result we were bothered every few minutes on our last morning by staff wanting to prepare for the next guests. I've never had no \"Do Not Disturb\" sign before.....neither have I had such a sensational Traditional English Afternoon Tea in any hotel anywhere....the De L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Europe Afternoon Tea service could teach London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ritz Hotel a thing or two. It was amazing. Forget The Ritz, book for tea at De L'Europe....and it's served with a smile and with pride. The technology in the rooms need a little adjustment but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all there. I could never get the sound from TV/Music to work through the bathroom speaker in 518. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s superb automated lighting; TV; I-pod dock; phone system. The towels are of highest quality and fluffy as are the hotel slippers. The bathrooms are terrific in every way as are the extras. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother risking leaks in your luggage, leave shampoos/conditioners and everything else at home. Everything supplied in the bathroom is worth using. The beds are of the highest quality and exceptionally comfortable. Room service is good. The hotel supplied us with a superb baby sitter one evening....we asked for a trustworthy female child-sitter.....they sent us a trainee lady paediatrician. Perfect. The kitchens are immaculate; the chefs are immaculate and the food served is immaculate. The views from both restaurants are stunning. I particularly liked the wine list. The lunch menu in the brassiere also lists wines available by the glass....and champagnes by the glass. I was seriously impressed because never before have I been anywhere, apart from the three Michelin rosette Waterside Inn in Bray, UK which serves my favourite drink, Ruinart Blanc de Blanc champagne by the glass. They also do Krug Grande Cuvee, Met Grand Vintage 2003 and others by the glass. This is THE OPPOSITE of the Crown Spa Hotel in Scarborough U.K. (see my review) where they serve nasty, flat champagne in a dirty glass! Now for afternoon tea:- Served in a beautiful area of the hotel known as The Promenade, next to a circular bar, tea, served from 3.00pm, overlooking the canal, was amazing. The staff bring out various teas as a way of building up the whole tea experience to a sort of crescendo. It is all really quite special. First tea up was Organic Sencha tea....a superb green tea. This was followed by a Darjeeling, Risheehat, 1st Flush vintage 2010 tea...actually made for further developing other time, as with a good wine....aromas of tropical fruit. Interspersed with all of this were perfect sandwiches and exceptional handmade pastries in wonderful colours and designs. The hotel employs the services of a serious pastry chef....and it shows. This was followed by Creative Thee (Gemengd) - Art Tea.....quite something. Served in a clear glass tea-pot this tea turned into a flower while we watched. Incredible. While this went on delicious pastries were served.....it was like a feast. Then came Chocolate tea. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth staying at this hotel just for the tea. They have at least 24 different gourmet teas on the menu, from all over the world. Now for what went wrong. Our first two Breakfasts! Our first two breakfasts let the entire hotel down. Ordering breakfast was sad, incoherent with a total absence of fluidity. It's as if the waitress taking the order failed to hear every 2nd word of the order. It was a jagged and jarred experience.....lots of stop/start. Breakfast at the superb De L'Europe should be the icing on the cake.....the view over the canal of the old clock tower is lovely.....the chairs in The Brassiere where breakfast is served are comfy, crockery/cutlery/tableware are modern and immaculate and the cooked breakfasts are all freshly prepared......no tired looking scrambled eggs at this hotel AND the breakfast menu is extensive.....at least it would be if the kitchen didn't run out of items such as smoked salmon. Ordering any variation (for instance English breakfast without certain items) produces glazed, vacant expressions from the waitresses. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow them to serve you. Ask for a male waiter. I think one of them also caused me trouble at lunch. There are two, non-Dutch waitresses, one pleasant but hopeless, the other has attitude and is similarly hopeless. The food is fresh/tasty... perfectly decent. What is completely untogether is the service which I can best describe as pitiful. I thought our painful first mornings breakfast experience on July 18th was perhaps a one-off when staff got most of our order wrong for all five of us, causing further lengthy delays upon delays however it's now clear to me that neither of the two female staff who served us listen and they are exceptionally incompetent. What they didn't get wrong, they forgot to bring. One of them was polite/smiley but hopeless.....she couldn't get anything right. The taller waitress actually wrote down our entire, detailed order on July 19th breakfast, then walked off without a word, or a smile.....then almost everything that turned up was wrong.....we also asked for hot chocolate for our children on sitting down.....nothing for half an hour. A third waitress taking my lunch order when the five of us sat at the chef's counter on our first day was rude.....muttering and huffing while attempting to correctly take my wine order. She didn't have a clue. However this was more than made up for by the terrific Head Sous Chef, Ton de Kulper, who was as excellent at ensuring we received everything we asked for as he and all the superb and well organised kitchen staff were at cooking and we enjoyed a perfect lunch on July 18th. At lunch the following day, waiters made a few mistakes such as pouring still water which we didn't order into sparkling water glasses but this was more than balanced by the superb table which the maitre 'd reserved for me and the view of endless cyclists pedalling by along the canal while holding umbrellas in the pouring rain (I'm not a fan of the cyclists after been run over by one a few years ago). At our second day's breakfast experience the waitress told me they had run out of smoked salmon. Pity as there's not much else my coeliac daughter will choose from the menu although there was gluten-free bread for her, which always receives much appreciation from us. One of four of my friends at another table (only staying at the hotel for the Take That stadium concert due to my recommendation), taking breakfast at the same time, ordered a smoke salmon bagel. He received his smoked salmon but was told they had run out of bagels. I ordered at the same time and was told there was no smoked salmon. How can the kitchen run out of smoked salmon at breakfast when they need it for the afternoon tea sandwiches? At our first breakfast I asked for fresh carrot juice. It turned up and was horrible.....clearly out of a bottle. At other Leading Hotels including Marbella Club, the Setai and Sandy Lane, only freshly made juices are ever served, including fresh carrot juice. However other Leading Hotels charge far more for breakfast. At this class of hotel, everything should be fresh but the hotel are entitled to charge for these extras. I would have happily paid for fresh carrot juice. The breakfast waitresses at De L'Europe nod, take the order and then it all turns up wrong. It's not as if breakfast is busy......most tables were empty at our second day's breakfast. I don't mind the wait at all given breakfast is, unusually, freshly cooked to order..... but I do mind the unnecessary additional wait when waitresses then need more time to correct their errors. It took them one whole hour just to produce hash browns for my coeliac daughter on our first breakfast. The self-service area for fruit/cereals/yogurt etc remained unreplenished for over half an hour.....they had also run out of cereal bowls. Am I being difficult, you may wonder? I don't think so.....this should be the top hotel in Amsterdam......and will be once their breakfast service is sorted out.....I've stayed at the others. Our second day breakfast took over half an hour to arrive.....an improvement over our first day. Our friends told me that 75 per cent of their breakfast order turned up completely wrong. Anyhow, that's what's wrong with breakfast. I ended up telling the breakfast staff what I thought of them. Breakfast on our third day was fantastic. Service was perfection. The food was lovely. The freshly squeezed orange juice was superb. Stefan, the Food and beverages manager saw to that. He explained to me that they have only been going for three weeks and that he aims to serve freshly made breakfasts in 15 minutes. He will get there although he may have to find another job for the useless waitresses.....they were beyond terrible. The guys were all terrific and the restaurant manager at breakfast is superb. This hotel was terrific. I give it full marks. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry about breakfast......They had sorted it out by our third day. I suffer....you get the benefit. I know many Tripadvisor contributors have sorted out problems in advance for me in the past and so.....my gift to you.....is Hotel De L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Europe. Owned by the Heineken family. They have spared no expense. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terrific. The pool was immaculate, a pleasure to use. Stay nowhere else in Amsterdam. PS There are seats in the lift.....a nice touch....but check your bill....there were mistakes on mine which took well over an hour to resolve....no thanks to a stupid, back office woman in a black suit who was seriously annoying but worry not......all of the rest of the reception staff are good, as are the concierge staff and especially the font of house manager. Any problems, ask for him.

In fairness, this is probably why people prefer the hotel for it's classic elegance. Also, the bathrooms were very updated and modern. The hotel itself is very quiet (though not sure if that was due to low occupancy or not), but the street our front (we faced the front) was very noisy as there was a lot of construction going on at all hours (sometimes it sounded like it was coming from the hotel or next door). The high speed internet is provided by telecom carrier KPN, not the hotel, and we found it to be slow most of the time. The hotel had a small pool that the kids enjoyed, although that may have been because we were the only ones in it at around 5pm. We will most likely stay here again on future trips due to the service and location, but would like to see a little change in the decor. The concierges were top knotch and had very helpful recommendations for restaurants. One that we particularly favored was Casa di David - excellent Italian food; it was packed so be sure to make a reservation. We also found Escape Caffe on our own to be a great lunch place, but turns into a club at night. Last piece of advice was that if you plan to visit any of the main sites - Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh museum or Anne Frank house, I would suggest an online booking before you leave home.

I am thankful we stayed on points and didn't have to pay the $500 plus it would have cost us per night. We booked 2 rooms, one with a king bed and one with twins for our girls. Thankfully, we were able to get rooms which had a connecting door. I can see that this Old World traditinal hotel was a grandly decorated hotel when new, but it could do with updating. It looked like Old World traditional. The bathrooms were marble, updated and a nice size though. We arrived during a heatwave so had to use the air conditioning which was barely passable. I found it annoying that housekeeping opened the windows when they cleaned the rooms, letting in all of the hot air, so we never came back at the end of the day to a cool room. The front desk was diplomatic but not friendly. We opted for convenience over price and ate breakfast in the dining room which was fantastically expensive (about $22 per person for the buffet). We never ate lunch or dinner there since there were much more interesting, and cheaper options nearby. The clientele seemed to be older couples. There were very few families. The indoor swimming pool is a spa pool and tiny - just enough to paddle around in. I did like the small size of the hotel though. It was quiet.

Later that day I needed to use the internet again and another woman helped me and was much nicer. When I told her of my earlier experience she replied that in defence of her collegue sometimes people come in off the street. I told her that I didn't come in from the street but down from my room via the elevator, she replied that sometimes the guests bring people in from the street. She did not appologize but had a similar arrogant attitude. I recommended to her that the manager of the hotel should spend a few nights at the Amigo Hotel in Brussels, where I had stayed before coming to this hotel, so that they might understand what good service is like. In a huff she said she would tell him. I went to the hotel next to the de L'Europe a 3 star hotel on the same canal and found although it was a little worn the people were extremely nice and offered a room at less than half the price of the de L'Europe. We had a very nice room, excellent bathroom, over looking the same canal and saved almost $1200.00 dollars. On top of this the de L'Europe had charged us $56.00 for a breakfast we never had.

Of course, the hotel falls within the luxury category; of course, you will not find dirty linen and neither will you be mistreated by the staff. However, it certainly does not deserve to be one of the \"Leading Hotels of the World\" - something which I have grown accustomed to regard more as a sacred text rather than a mere hotel directory. The exterior is mostly unimpressive; indeed, the spectacular night shot splattered all over promotional materials is, at the very least, deceiving. The lobby is equally uncharacteristic - more appropriate in a good 4-star hotels than in a deluxe 5-star property. No specific complaints about the rooms: everything was there and everything functioned appropriately, but this sort of hotels should offer that indescribable additional factor which, in my opinion, was lacking here. Another thing that struck me as belonging to a lesser-standard establishment was the corridors: a mixture of conservative classicism and awful 70s door frames - very uncool. On a more positive note, the restaurant \"Excelsior\" is pretty decent and more than reasonably priced. That said, I must acknowledge that I managed to find the rooms at a discounted rate (around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250 at lhw.com) and, accordingly, these complaints do appear to have a somewhat pedantic tone. However, if you were to pay the rack rate for the rooms, which orbits around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400 for doubles, my criticism would be more than justified. If you want to go to a true deluxe hotel in Amsterdam, I suggest you head, as pointed out by an earlier review, to the Amstel: a proper establishment, whose restaurant, \"la Rive\", is also superb, though considerably pricier than \"the Excelsior\". If you scout the web well, you may be able to find a room for around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300, which is more than fair given the standards - surprisingly high for an Inter-Continental. Also, if you are looking for a design/boutique address, and are willing to fork out at least \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400 a night, then the Dylan is the place for you: by far the most stylish hotel in town, its restaurant is also worthy of mention.", "Date": "May 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Switzerland", "Title": "\u201c...Not even one complaint!\u201d", "Author": "thebigfinn", "ReviewID": "UR3403327", "Content": "We just returned from a two-night stay at this hotel, and I have to say that the service was fantastic.

The staff were very welcoming, but our room was very small, a suite with a separate sitting room. I asked for an upgrade as we are amex card holders and we were given a superb room. The reason that the first room was small was the fact that I suffer from asthma and asked for a non-smoking room, but to be honest, the second room that we were offered was fantastic, with a view of the street and was huge, the sitting area was in the bedroom. Also the bathroom was much better. The first room had a small bath and one sink with no separate shower or toilet, and did not have a bidet. the second room was a smoking room, but I could not smell the smoke, and on the plus side it had a superb bathroom with a separate shower big enough for two, and a bath- also a separate toilet area with a bidet- bliss! The toiletries were Bulgari 'au the vert' which is my signature scent so I was very pleased. The staff could not do enough for us- the concierge 'Alex' was the most helpful man in the world- he booked us an indonesian restaurant which was fabulous- we had reservations when we entered it as it was small, hot and very busy, but the staff all spoke english and were so friendly- plus the food was exceptional. Also Alex booked us another restaurant and helped us to find places of interest, especially the sex museum! That was a must- located on Damrack- don't bother with the one in the red light district as it was rubbish! Amsterdam does not feel very safe in the red light district in the daytime as there were all sorts of characters offering us drugs, but at night (once I had left my handbag in the hotel room) it felt very safe- loads of tourists and police around. We went into the sex shops just for the experience and saw the ladies of the night- wild or what! Walked for miles in the day, but disappointing to find that the two major art museums were closed. Some of the diamond centres were disappointing but there is plenty to do- just when we were getting into the swing of things it was time to leave- and we stayed for 4 days too. Freddys bar was great, very intimate and the barman was so nice, he looked after us. Check out a canal boat ride as we never had time to do one, but looked good. Very interesting city, dare to see the sex and drug culture even if it isn't your kind of thing- there's nowhere quite like it anywhere else in the world- to be sure I will be going back, when- I really don't know as it was 16 years ago I last went before now!
