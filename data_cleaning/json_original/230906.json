I am astonished at the positive reviews for this hotel. Our room was so tiny that the (pushed together twin) beds took up almost all of the floorspace. There was no place to put the suitcase except on the floor in front of the door. The hotel is immediately beside a tram stop, but after taking the tram to downtown, we found ourselves waiting for a ride, in the cold rain, for over 30 minutes twice. Customer service was fine during the day, but the evening clerk was worse than rude. The Internet is a joke. I was never able to log on, and there was no one to help. I have stayed in hotels in Europe, Asia, Australia, North America and South America during the past year (multiple times in most of these locations), and this was the most expensive hotel, with the smallest room, and the most offensive clerk I have ever experienced. As an added disappointment, we saw very few tulips, except for the ones for sale in the stores, and this was in mid April.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle", "Title": "\u201cNot as good as I expected\u201d", "Author": "PatT373", "ReviewID": "UR128115963", "Content": "I've just returned from this hotel after a break with my husband. We felt that it was a nice Bed and Breakfast style hotel but a little overpriced for what was on offer. It's location was alright but not as near to the museum area as described but the tram system is excellent in Amsterdam and with an Iamsterdam card it was easy to get about. There was not too much noise from the cars and trams through the night but either the lift or main doors woke us up by 6.30 am.- the noise seemed to come through the floor. At least we got an early breakfast and was in Amsterdam nice and early! Another slight problem was the limited area for breakfast - just not enough seating for everyone when a few of us arrived at the same time. There was a television in the bedroom but you had to pay at reception for a card to access any programmes at all. We found this strange that no programmes were available for free.

My room was quite big and had access to kind of a roof terrasse to the back of the house. However, my colleagues had smaller rooms and complained of a tiny bathroom.

The room was clean with fresh white linen and extremely comfortable beds and cosy quilts. There was a kettle and tea/coffee. The ensuite just fitted the basics with a shower cubicle. The only disadvantage was the 2 inch gap under the door so it wasn't terribly private, although there was another loo on the landing! I had the window open the first night as I hadn't switched on the air conditioning. Our room was in the front of the hotel and there was some traffic noise, and dustmen arriving at around 5am on one day.

It is in a good location and looks okay at the entrance and in the lobby, but it disappoints after this. Impressions from point of entry to getting to the room: - I'm informed at reception that I have a choice of paying for the room completely up front for all nights, or the hotel will keep a lock on my credit card for this amount until the transaction is closed out at the end of my stay. - Elevator has the look and feel of a freight elevator. It thinks twice about whether it wants to go and then bumps once before actually starting the ascent. - Elevator door opens to 1970's curtains flanking a huge Coke machine (EUR 2.50/Coke) - Hall carpet is stained and worn - Hall door has been progressing damaged over time by the housekeeping cart - Fire hose is exposed in the hall rather than recessed in a cabinet - Room door opens okay and starts to close after I enter but then hits the partially ripped out burglar lock and then fails to shut fully without assistance - The walls appear to me to be asbestos painted stark white with no decorations on most walls other than the black of suitcases which have scuffed the one wall where the suitcase stand sits. - Water-based heating radiator is turned off. It works when I turn it on and I adjust it to level 3, but then I see that the window curtains hang completely over the radiator such that I need to bunch them up on top of the radiator if I want heat from the radiator to come into the room instead of staying on the window side of the curtains. - The bathroom is a self-contained drop-in unit that is very small compared to the size that it could be based on the size of the hotel room. It is almost possible to stand up from the toilet without hitting yourself on the industrial toilet paper holder in front of you. Stepping into the shower requires navigating between the toilet and the toiler paper holder after which I found that the shower door does not close without risking cutting your fingers by reaching down underneath and manipulating the slider on the lower track. Luckily once the shower is completely wet, the door slides open easier. - Bed is comfortable. - Room has two chairs for sitting, but they are hardly inviting to sit in. - TV is old type but functional. - Wireless internet is EUR 10 per day (noon to noon). Works fine. - Breakfast is best described as ordinary. Functional breads, basic meats (no Salmon, no Westfalen ham), basic cheese (partially oxidized from sitting out at prior day's breakfast), no yogurt. Instant coffee is okay but not great. Breakfast area has a plasma screen TV. This is nice. Wish they had these in the rooms. - Staff is enjoyable to talk to over breakfast in the morning. One of the guys is especially sociable. - Easy access to Tram 5 for travel to WTC and south-axis businesses. Tram stop is just outside the door. Also it is a pleasant walk from here to WTC when the weather is nice. The staff were a highlight. But the hotel needs a makeover. Don't believe the sign in the elevator which says 'Excuse the renovation'. This sign is left over from summer 2008. There is no renovation going on, although there needs to be. If you're okay with a hotel that has no soul, I would recommend the Qbic Hotel in the WTC instead of the Hampshire. At at least in the Qbic the bathroom is bigger, and there are no asbestos-looking walls. In my opinion the reasonable price doesn't adequately compensate for the sub-par conditions at the Hampshire.", "Date": "February 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jakarta Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cWorked just Great for me\u201d", "Author": "SirDaniel", "ReviewID": "UR18128706", "Content": "I just needded a place to stay and got so much more.

However, it's nothing outstanding either. The main reason for staying here is that it's very close to the WTC (10 minutes walk) and the prices are reasonable (100 Euro/night on average). A supermarket's just round the corner which is handy for snacks as well as several restaurants on Beethovenstraat. I've stayed in a single room, a small double room and a large double room. The small double was the worst, because it looked like it was meant for a single room but they just put an extra bed there so there was no space to walk around. But on the whole it's a comfortable place to stay. Air con has been fitted since the summer, but they aren't functional yet. I found it a bit cold a couple of times and once I got back from work early, there was no hot water. Breakfast is typical continental. The dining area is small and there was one occasion where I had to wait for a table to be cleared before I could sit down. 24 hour reception and you're supposed to leave your room key if you go out. They lock the front doors after 10pm but you just ring a bell and the receptionist opens it if you're out late. Tram is right outside the door (number 5) which takes you do WTC Zuid or to Central Station. TV is OK in the room. You can buy smoovie TV, which has the additional channels, but I've never tried. There's normally 3-4 channels with something English on (inc. BBC and CNN). They have Wifi throughout the hotel, but it's terribly expensive. It's 10 Euro from noon to noon. It would be better if it was 24 hours from first use, but seems like they want to make money from each night you stay. Bathrooms are tiny!!! Even in the large double room, it seems like they wasted a lot of space with nothing - could have had a large jacazzi in there, but they just had the tiny cubical bathrooms, just enough space to dry yourself after the shower. No minibar, fridge or room service, just a kettle and mugs for making tea/coffee. Rooms are cleaned daily, though they didn't clean a cup I used for tea once.

Although there is a general collection of bric a brac visible in the gardens below, you'd probably expect this. I was fortunate to have a balcony, which was a cool place for a drink in between wanderings around Amsterdam. The hotel was generally and the room particularly clean.
