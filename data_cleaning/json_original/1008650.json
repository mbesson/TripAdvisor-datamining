Was generally quite pleased with the experience, would stay here again. Building was new and spotless; standard king-bed room was spacious and well laid out; bathroom was immaculate (granite counter, decent no-name toiletries, excellent water pressure). Fitness center was spacious and had big windows -- not off in the basement somewhere -- and they had a indoor pool, which doesn't seem customary in this price range. (Self) parking in the adjacent garage was $12, which seemed about half the price of the parking fees at most downtown hotels. Free wireless in rooms, and they also had a business center off the lobby. Staff was friendly and helpful. I didn't try the comp breakfast. Location is good. It's directly adjacent to Lucas Oil Stadium. It's about a five block walk to the center of downtown Indianapolis. There are other hotels that are more centrally located, but those are either a lot pricier or are older, dated properties that have hidden fees (eg higher parking or Internet) that push the price up. I didn't mind walking the five blocks, but if you want to be right atop Monument Circle, this isn't the place. The one downside is that the sound insulation in this new hotel is not great. I was there four nights. Two nights things were utterly silent. A third night I actually heard my neighbors' voices in the adjacent room -- couldn't make out the words, but could definitely tell when their conversation would begin and end (and they weren't yelling). The fourth night was New Years, so the overall noise level was understandably high, but every time a door closed on the floor it echoed through my room. All in all, this wasn't a huge problem for me, but it was definitely some of the worst sound insulation I've ever encountered in a hotel, so if you're especially sensitive to that, I'd factor it into your planning. Which is a shame, because the staff here does such a great job -- but remedying lousy construction standards isn't part of their job. Again, for me, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cHas everything you would look for in a mid-range hotel.\u201d", "Author": "winslow82", "ReviewID": "UR121549055", "Content": "Came in and stayed for the Big Ten Championship Football Game and we enjoyed a fantastic time here, and in town.

When the Kleenex box was empty in my room after just one tissue, I phoned and asked for another (this should have been checked by maid when cleaning the room before my arrival) they told me they were out and they had a truck coming in the morning. I just commented that that would not be of any help to me then. Also, when using the one remaining tissue from the box, the holder which had been pushed back into the corner of the Bathroom counter, I found a used Kleenex behind the container. That tells me something about how the maid cleaned the room and had me questioning how good a job was done on the rest of the room. I think this was a poor response to me as a customer. My thoughts: why would there have been a shortage in the first place?, and two, were all the rooms filled in the whole hotel that they couldn't have gone to an unused room and pulled the Kleenex box out for my room? I know this probably sounds trivial, but I didn't appreciate the answer, or the idea my room was not clean.

When we went into the room our first impression was good. I used one of their towels to wipe the draws out then I unpacked our luggage. We went out to eat came back went to bed. We got up the following morning (Friday) got ourselves ready to leave the room, I picked my purse up off the table that sits in between the beds with the lamp, clock and phone on it. I notice a small bug on my purse. I tried to prevent the bug from going into my purse but the little bug moved so quickly my eyes could not follow it. My purse was black and the table was also dark in color. I empted the content of my purse on the bed to make sure the bug was not in my purse. I could not find the bug ,so I put everthing back in my purse and my husband and I left for breakfast and to spend the day with my cousin. We was gone all day. We returned to the hotel it had been a long day so we went to bed. The following morning (Saturday) I woke up with a red spot on my right upper arm by now I am a little concern that maybe there are bed bugs in our room. I went to the bathroom to check my body for other spots, but I did not see any other spots so I was relieved. I checked the beds but I did not see anything. Saturday night after the Circle City Classic game was over we purchased food and headed back to our room. We sat around talked and watched TNT. I turned the lamp on that sat on the table in between the beds. I was sitting on the side of the bed watching TV. My pop was on the table and I reached for the pop and these little bugs was running all over the white brochure and around the top of the table. I put my glases on and the bugs was also on the headboard and the wall that the head board was attached on. My husband and I killed a few of them but they kept coming. We call the front desk , The desk clerk an older white lady came up to investigate. She saw the bugs, and change us from room 211 to room 210. Sunday morning when we went to check out the night desk clerk was no longer there, and according to the day desk clerk and manager on duty Sunday morning the night clerk that gave us the key cards and brought up the cart for us to move from room 211 to room 210 wrote she saw one bug. The manager gave my husband a card and told him to call the General Manager Richard Letko. I showed the night desk clerk the bugs, she saw the bugs with her own eyes. The fact that they lied about their bug problem in the room I stayed in made me believe they knew about the bugs. I do not believe my husband and I are the first to report it. I am not sure if these bugs just come out at night or if I just did not notice them because the wood was dark and maybe because I was gone most of the day. bugs was also on the desk, but nothing like on the table in between the two beds.

One of the things we were looking forward to doing during our visit was a tour of the Colts' Lucas Oil Stadium. As far as location goes, this hotel is the perfect place to stay if you're wanting to do that or are going for a Colts game. On the other hand, this hotel is just a short drive from the Indianapolis Zoo, canal walk, and downtown shopping and sightseeing, but might not be ideal if you're wanting to walk to those places. They aren't as close as they appear on maps, and local construction and busy streets made walking not as safe. Besides the stadium, two other hotels and a gas station across the street, there isn't really anything else within a few blocks. During the stay, you can either park in a parking garage adjacent to the hotel or in a small parking lot behind the hotel if there's room. There was room for us to park in the lot, but they still automatically added $10/day to our bill for parking, which I thought was odd... The room was nice with trendy furnishings, but nothing spectacular. We were able to enjoy both the whirlpool and the heated swimming pool. The gym also looked nice, but we didn't use it during our stay. I loved how the front lobby area was decorated and enjoyed sitting there in the morning to watch the news on TV. There also are three computers in the lobby that are free to use and had super-fast internet. The hotel provides a free, but basic continental breakfast with one hot \"special\" of the day (scrambled eggs w/ diced ham one morning and bacon and hard-boiled eggs the next), and also served bagels, toast, cereal, danishes, fruit and juice, milk and coffee. The hotel also has a cafe/bar area where you can order meals and drinks and I noticed a lot of other people eating/drinking there. Overall, we were satisfied with this hotel and would probably stay there again when visiting Indianapolis.", "Date": "July 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel in Town!\u201d", "Author": "leighleigh9", "ReviewID": "UR22647459", "Content": "Beautiful property, wonderful amenities and the staff was just great!

She's getting a thank you note. New hotel, right next to my other favorite the Staybridge. Compared to other Comfort Suites I've stayed with before this was great! They had a bar and restaurant which I've never seen in any Comfort before. The lobby and rooms all seemed very modern and colorful the red hallways are way cool. My room was great- it was clean and the flat screen tv was nice. The free internet was also a great bonus. Front desk girl, Wanda, was helpful, gave us directions and a map for a great seafood restaurant, Oceanaire. Didn't get a chance to visit the breakfast, bummer. I would suggest to anyone staying here, ask for a room with a view of the Lucas Oil Stadium! This is my second time in Indy. So far i'm very impressed.

The basic complimentary breakfast was welcomed and good. The soap and shampoo provided are not particularly special. The business center in the lobby was really helpful so my co-workers and I were happy to have that accessible.
