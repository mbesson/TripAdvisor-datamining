Just a short taxi ride to the Airport Express Kowloon terminal. Very convenient shopping adn eating area. Just across the street from the Temple Street night market. It's a no frill with very small room, although I have seen even smaller ones elsewhere. Wifi works fine. My only complain is that it's not possible to book on line but you can call the hotel and reserve on an honour system. It does no give me a secure feeling. But so far the manager has been keeping my room until I come.", "Date": "July 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cAwesome hospitality, close to MTR station, value-for-money\u201d", "Author": "LeeSK", "ReviewID": "UR132488834", "Content": "For starters, I must say both Mr Chung are very accommodating and friendly.

But hey this is Hong Kong so who are we to complain? I think the room size can be considered average for Hong Kong! Great location, literally 2 mins from Jordan MTR station, a very plus is friendly owner that run the hotel by himself. Room is clean and fairly modern and well kept! Air conditioner did breakdown on the first night but it wasn't very hot and it was rectified the first thing in the morning! A clue, do not book online just call in to book.
