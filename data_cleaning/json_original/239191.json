{"Reviews": [{"Content": "This Is a Very Special Experience We recently spent three wonderful months at Palazzo Antellesi, and we relished every day and experience in Florence and in Tuscany. The apartment buidling, which was originally a family Palazzo dating from the 12th century, is centrally located in the historic district of this ancient city. Within comfortable walking distance are so many of the jewels of the artistic and architectural heritage of the Medici era that one easily becomes an ardent fan of this period in western civilization. We stayed in three different apartments, and all were equipped with modern amentinies, and the decor in each was superb and in keeping with the ambiance of the neighborhood and the historical tradition. All this can be viewed readily on the website of Pallazo Antellesi.com. Lastly, we appalud the gracious and most helpful demeanor of the staff that manages and maintains Palazzo Antellesi.", "Date": "Jan 1, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR653256627", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "TonyCline"}, {"Content": "Wonderful Way to Experience a Slice of Life We just returned from 10 days in Italy and stayed in a 2 bed, 2 bath apartment in Palazzo Antelessi on Piazza Santa Croce. The Palazzo is historic with an interesting story regarding the frescos on the exterior and interior and the countess. The apartment was true to web pictures. We loved the location which was close to everything we wanted to see and do. Easy access to shopping, markets, gelato (a new addiction for my niece), dining and sites. $6 Euro taxi ride from SMN train station and available taxis for the return trip at the top of the sqaure. The apartment was fabulous....Francesca was fabulous and we had a wonderful time. We stayed in Paradiso which was approximately 1000 sq. ft, soaring ceilings, frescos on the walls and a small juliet window balcony where we watched daily life unfold. The apartment had an open kitchen, dining and living set up so we could all be together when cooking and relaxing...it worked out perfectly. My niece really enjoyed shopping at the market for food and helping with the dinner prep. The apartment had two bedrooms, one master with a king bed and private bath (shower only) and a second bedroom (twin beds) with an adjoined bath (bath/ handheld shower combo). The apartment was well equipped with glasses, dishes, pots/pans and basic spices. Dining table had seating for 6, two couches, two chairs, a sitting bench and chairs in each bed. There was more than enough clothing storage in both bedrooms. The apartment had basic paper supplies and detergent for the dishwasher and washer. Soap was provided in each bathroom however no other bath products were supplied. We had our own so this was not a problem. There were plenty of blankets and towels for our stay. The apartment was equipped with wireless internet at a supplemnt (we did not use as I have a global data card). The apartment had a new washer/dryer and dishwasher (both worked very well and quick). We paid $2020 USD for four nights plus a cleaning of $120. The piazza was busy during the day but quieted down in the evening. We never had a noise issue at night and slept well....the pillows were not so great but we adjusted after the first night. We woke one morning to a children's field and track day on the square and another to a period school show complete with drummers, costumes, flag twirling and dancing. So incredible...we loved watching the square come alive in the mornings and come to a close in the evening. What a lsice of life to watch the children at play in the evenings with soccer balls, bikes and scooters.... My 11 year old niece wants to go back....she said Florence was her favorite and I beleive that was due to the apartment, location and the warm people we met while on our adventure (her words). Should we return to Florence (so many other places to show my niece), we would stay at the Palazzo again. They have multiple apartments to rent with various bed and price options. http://www.palazzoantellesi.com/", "Date": "May 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR352515817", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MDJDenver"}, {"Content": "pros and cons of apartment life on Piazza Santa Croce Our family group of five just returned from two weeks in Apartment Tosca at the Palazzo Antellisi. Overall, the rental worked out great: our elderly mother was able to set her own schedule while we were out and about more often. She loved people watching from the front windows overlooking Santa Croce and cooking in a well-appointed kitchen; having the washer/dryer was also a big help. On the down side, the rent seems high given that you have to buy all of your own supplies except linens, e.g., paper towels, detergents, toilet paper and kleenex; and, regardless of your neatness, you will be charged a final cleaning bill of 80 Euros. Internet connection is also charged separately, as is electric and gas. Also, one of our three bedrooms overlooked the Piazza Santa Croce; the PR that this is a quiet location is just not accurate. Overall, we were pleased and would recommend PA to others; we would definitely recommend that they rent a place with bedrooms in the back of the building.", "Date": "Oct 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR894218721", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "tdme"}, {"Content": "Our family at home in Florence Three years ago some friends and I stayed at the Palazzo Antellesi in a three bedroom apartment, the Donatello. This May I have booked the same apartment for my daughter and husband, son and wife, and various grandchildren. Frankly, if the Antellesi had not been available, I would have stayed home!The apartment is very spacious. While my son watches CNN in the living room, a daughter-in-law stirs up a snack in the kitchen, and grandchildren work a jigsaw puzzle on the huge dining room table, I can be stealing a much-needed nap in one of the bedrooms. Tomorrow morning there will be no competition for the shower, as each of the 3 bedrooms has its own bath. And the game didn't have to be dismantled either, because Bill has gone around the corner to pick up fresh croissants on the Via Neri and breakfast will be in the breakfast room. Maybe Maureen will run a load of laundry in the washing machine (though working it takes a bit of practice for Americans), and Kate will be mapping our day - always walkable to just about anywhere in Florence from our central location on the Piazza Santa Croce. And the best part comes after dinner, when we can share experiences of the day and laugh together in the spacious living room.We've shopped for our own groceries and paper products, but it's fun to mix with the natives, the kids have their favorite cereal, and everything else is provided. You'll fall in love with apartment living the first night you really need a grilled cheese sandwich at 11:00.Vicky, the Manager, speaks wonderful English and is there to help with anything we need from a driver to cleaning help.The apartments are part of a 16th c. palace - informal and comfortable. Decor is definitely Florentine - you'll know you're not staying in a Holiday Inn. Two of the smaller units even have terraces.Problems? We did have an occasional lack of hot water from one or another faucet, but there was always another bathroom to borrow, and tomorrow we may be the lucky ones! And of course, the washing machine...Cost? It sounds expensive when you first look at it, but if you can spend at least two weeks in Florence (a great base for day trips by train, bus, or private car), it's quite reasonable. With utilities, you won't spend more than $100 per night per bedroom...and you'll be living and feeling like Florentines.", "Date": "Jan 23, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR185966081", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d239191-r23158809-Palazzo_Antellesi-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "239191", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
