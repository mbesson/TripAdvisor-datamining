This was booked through an agent and we had the Deluxe Room. We took the Aleleguna water bus from the airport and alighted at the San Zaccaria stop which was about a 5 minute walk away (another option is the Rialto stop). It is possible to take a water taxi but this costs over 100 euro. When we arrived we were greeted with a smile and taken to our rooms, with the porter bringing up our luggage shortly afterwards. The deluxe room was on the top floor (there was a lift!) and was spacious and stylish, the old beams had been incorporated into the modern refurbishment of the hotel. The breakfast was a Buffett and was very nice, with a selection of cheeses, meats, egg, bacon, pastries, cereals and Prosecco! We asked for help at reception a couple of times and every time they were very helpful, friendly and professional. The location is ideal, only 5 minutes walk from St. Marks Square but far enough away to be slightly quieter and the view from our Deluxe room on the top floor was incredible. This was our Honeymoon so we splashed out a bit more but I think we would spend the extra money to stay here again based the amazing experience we had.

I managed to get a great rate that included breakfast for just under \u00c2\u00a3100 a night. When I booked the hotel room, I contacted the hotel to request a high floored and quiet room, along with information on how to get to the hotel. The hotel responded quickly to emails and explained they would do there best to provide the type of room requested, and gave us a few options on how to get to the hotel. First option is for the hotel to arrange a private water taxi from airport to hotel, but this costs over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100, another option is to get a water taxi at the airport which is a littler cheaper, or which we did is get the Alilaguna water taxi. The pier at the airport is 5-10 minute pleasant stroll from the airport terminal. You can either buy Alilaguna tickets online before you go which works out at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1 cheaper or buy tickets at ticket desk at the pier. It's \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25 each for a return ticket at the pier ticket desk. The best line to get is the orange line as this takes you to Rialto, which is a 5-10 minute walk to the hotel. Email the hotel for a map or print a google map before you go as there are a few twists and turns on the way, along with a few bridges with steps. On arrival at the hotel, check in was very quick and we were taken up to our room (in a tiny lift) which was on the top floor looking over the canal. Take into consideration they now charge \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4 a day per person city tax charge, which at the time of booking was not aware of. We stayed in a standard room which was very large and very nice, with an excellent bathroom. It all seemed recently refurbished. So all in all, in regards to the rooms, no problems at all, was very pleased. Beds were very comfortable, but pillows not so much. I like flat, soft pillows, but they did not have these in the rooms, and when I rang reception they said the only types of pillow they have are in the room already, but all pillows In the room are the same, so I ended up stuffing 2 cushions in a pillow case and using them for the 3 nights. So, this part not really ideal for a 4 star luxury hotel, as most 4 star hotels have a pillow menu with at least 2/3 choices. The rooms have free wi-fi but you need to ring reception for a username and password to get online. Nice large tv but only 3 English channels which are all news channels, so glad I had my iPad which I could connect to Tv via HDMI to fill free time watching a film. Breakfast is served from 7.30am to 10.30am, so we went for breakfast on our 1st morning just after 10. At this time there were lots of empty tables that had not been tidied and remade for new guests so had to wait for a table to be prepared. At this time there were no croissants or hot food. The following day we had breakfast at around 9, which was a really busy time but managed to get a table which was made up for arriving guests. All in all a decent breakfast if you head down at an earlier time so you can get hot food, a decent spread of meats, breads, fruit etc. The best thing about this hotel along with the high standard of its rooms, is its location. Located in a quiet square, out of the way of the really touristy spots, but within a few minutes walk of the San Marco Square and Rialto bridge. Plenty of local restaurants that are all pretty much the same, except for price. Beware of high cover charges and service charge. Try and pick somewhere that does not charge cover or service. Avoid Da:Sabrina, it looks nice, but food is poor. In regards to the San Marco sites, you can get a pass for the Doges Palace and other San Marco museums for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac16 which you can buy at the palace or online. You can also buy skip the queue tickets for the St Marks Basillica online for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1 each which gains instant entry at a specific time, as queues are always very long for entry, which is free. We also went up the Campanile which is \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8. In regards to the hotel, all in all a super find in a well located, quiet area, a few minutes walk from everywhere. Rooms are large and very nice.

Basically there was nothing they could do and said we would have to wait 'till morning before action could be done to address the problem because there was no other rooms although they did send some fans ! It definately seemed to be getting hotter and to be honest it felt as though i'd been out on the beach all day and had sun burn. My partner then went to reception and explained this was so uncomfortable. When she came back she was in tears and said the 2 men on reception had been really rude to her. Let's put it this way, after a frank discussion they found another room in the hotel, heaven knows why we went through all this upset in the 1st place when there was a vacant room all this time, ridiculous. Obviously the night's sleep wasn't the greatest after all that had gone on and i went to reception in the morning to complain once more about last night's problems. I spoke to a Gentleman called Simone who gave apologies and said can the hotel and us start afresh and try again. I have to say that Simone was very good and restored some of our confidence in the hotel and was even good enough to send a bottle of prosecco and some sweets to the room when we came back from the day out.

We had booked a standard room via AmEx travel, but kept remembering comments here that upgrades were worth it. So, we did an upgrade to a junior suite, unfortunately at our own expense, but negotiated down 50% from what they originally wanted to charge us. What a difference - the first space was oppressive and dark, the junior suite had 16\" beamed ceilings and 3 windows. The building, a converted palazzo, is fabulous. The bed was super comfortable. The bathroom had ample hot water. The staff could not have been nicer. The included breakfast was great, and the in-house bar was quiet and pleasant. (Same space, different times of day!) Only complaint was that in the bathroom there was duct tape on the shower barrier and when I mentioned it at the desk they looked perplexed and we never got an explanation. We did our own laundry (travel laundry line, inflatable hangers) and didn't use any other services, so we were able to manage the budget well. One proviso - if you use the hotel's complementary water taxi to Murano, it will drop you off at a factory in the middle of nowhere (the factories pay for these rides) and you will be attacked by salesman/men. So find out the name of the factory ahead of time, get a good map of Murano, and immediately head over to the main drag. It's only a 5 minute walk but a world of difference.

With all the due respect for disabled people, you can imagine that the situation can be awkward on a romantic trip. The room has the door just next to the reception, so literally anybody look at you as you move in and out and stare into the room where there might be your partner in underwear. I have never seen anything like that in my entire life. The room is obviously sub-standard and shouldn't be used at all if not for people with handicap. Suggestion, avoid booking standard rooms in this place as you will pay crazy money for a substandard hotel, I had a 2 stars experience at most. As we settle in we soon realize it is freezing inside. I call reception and mention the issue, the answer is \"yes I can see that, it is 17 degrees C in there as it was unoccupied before your arrival, we'll put the temperature up immediately\". Shouldn't have they prepared the room for our arrival? I don't work in a hotel but it seems pretty basic common sense to me. We had to stay in the room with coats on and eventually had to live as temperature wasn't building up, the building is very old and very poorly insulated, especially if you are on the ground floor, in the corner of the building. The free WI-FI didn't work, not in the ground floor at least, and I tried with both PC and mobile. They charge local taxes even if your booking clearly include them. Buffet breakfast is full english but very poor. Fruit juices are not freshly squeezed and are horrible, a freshly squeezed orange juice is charged 5 Euro. Fried eggs 8 Euro, 10 with ham or bacon. Very poor representation of italian salami and cheese in terms of quality and selection (1 salami, 1 cooked ham and 1 cheese). During the breakfast the staff in the kitchen was clearly arguing and the whole atmosphere was pretty annoying.

I bought the weekend break as a treat for my wife's 40th birthday, and together with our 3 year old daughter, and we had a lovely time. The Good: - Beautiful palazzo. - Great location. - Very friendly staff. - Service was always correct & efficient. The champagne I pre-ordered was waiting in our room on our arrival. - Daughter made to feel very welcome. - Junior suite was visually stunning and was modern but with a real sense of history. The Less Good: - As many have said, the breakfast was a bit average. Everything was nice enough, but not very much selection, especially of hot food. - Bathroom was fine, but slightly on the small side. - No milk in room - had to be ordered in for us to make a cup of tea. - No iron in room (could have requested one, but decided not to bother). - \u00e2\u201a\u00ac150 for airport transfer (which we didn't take). Whilst it sounds like a great service, that is an extortionate amount. You can get the water bus into town for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15 and it leaves you with a 10 min (pleasant) walk. The Worst - No free wifi. I knew this in advance, but I still think that today, any 4* in the world should provide this. - The bed was 2 singles pushed together and it was too hard. - Pillows were thin. 1 extra pillow was provided which isn't enough for a Junior Suite for 3 people. - Bell-boy was insistent (not aggressively) that he would show us to our room and then bring the bags up. I then waited for the inevitable, and incredibly annoying \"linger\" while he waited for his tip. When will hotels learn to pay their staff enough so that they can remove this culture whereby everyone expects extra payment for something the customer doesn't find particularly amazing. After all, I'm a big boy and after lugging my bags through the narrow streets and over the bridges of Venice, I think I can get them up a lift to my room. Getting them taken care of is nice, but ultimately disappointing when you spend the first 10 minutes of your stay wondering how much tip will be expected and how guilty you will be made to feel. OK - so my biggest gripes relate not to Ruzzini alone, but reflect some of my grievances about the hotel industry generally. We had a lovely time, and my wife had a memorable birthday. My advice to Ruzzini would be that your experience is very nearly GREAT. The niggles I have are pretty small, but they add up to be greater than the sum of their parts. Fixing the small things would stop people like me dwelling on whether this was a satisfactory 4* experience and just leaving with a satisfied glow.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wollongong, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWhat a fantastic place to stay\u201d", "Author": "aussieontour42", "ReviewID": "UR123084730", "Content": "I cannot fault the Ruzzini, from the moment we arrived we were treated with the very best service!

One piece of advice - unless you are only carrying hand luggage or are very fit use either the hotels transfer service from Marco Polo airport, or just get in a water taxi at Marco Polo. Not cheap at 110 euros, but it delivers you right to the back door of the hotel. (The other plus is that the ride reminded me of a boat chase from a 1960s Bond film!).

PERFECT location--within a ten minute walk to San Marco Square (which we could see from our window) and in the other direction--ten minutes to the Rialto Bridge. What a wonderful surprise we had upon arrival. We were greeted by the day the Concierge, Mr. Scarpa, with warmth and respect. The rooms were not quite ready so Mr. Scarpa invited us for a glass of wine in the lounge, until we could unpack for the night. We had previously made plans with friends to meet for supper and now they had no idea where we were---the concierge took care of all these details for us, made all the phone calls necessary and established a new meeting place. The evening was a success due to the attention of the professionals at the Ruzzini Palace. Every courtesy was extended to us to make our stay a perfect one. The hotel was quiet and very upscale, immaculate with every detail necessary being taken into consideration. Regretfully on the last day, in the last hours, we misplaced our video camera in the hotel. Saddened by this we left Venice early the next morning without it---- Within hours of getting home, we received an email from the Concierge stating that it had been found and they would be forwarding it directly to our home, compliments of the hotel.

No reasonable explanation was given from the front desk whether this was a rare occurrence, whether the power loss was widespread or limited only to our hotel, or whether they had needed and brought in a repairman. After returning to our 6th floor room after breakfast, I cautioned my wife that we'd better take the stairs to the lobby. As luck would have it, the power went out again without warning, as we were heading to the lobby. Thank goodness we weren't stuck in the telephone booth sized elevator in need of rescue. Again, the front desk seemed relatively unconcerned for our safety, or of the power outage(s). 2) The next evening the smoke/fire alarms woke me up at 2:30 am. The hallway mounted (not in room) alarms were not very loud, and I needed to wake my wife and daughter, and open the room door to confirm that , yes, an alarm was sounding. The alarms remained on for more than 5 minutes, and we dressed and walked down 6 flights to the lobby. The night desk clerk seemed very flustered, and was desperately trying to turn off the alarms. He seemed poorly trained regarding the alarm and hotel's safety systems. He could not offer any information or explanation whether the alarms were for smoke or fire. I thought there may possibly be an electrical fire in light of the day's electrical and power outages. His recourse was to tell us he had called the day manager. We did see him propping open the lobby fire doors in an attempt to silence the lobby alarms( But, isn't that the point of auto closing fire doors?) Again, during this 30 minute interval he could not tell us the cause of the alarms, nor whether there was a a genuine emergency or false alarm. Interesting that only 6-8 guests eventually arrived in the lobby in the middle of the night, and evidently no attempt was made to have other guests evacuate their rooms. Was the alarm only sounding on the 6th floor hallways? Was it possible the hotel emergency alarm system would only evacuate a single floor? The day manager arrived, and also spent some time examining the alarm console and trying to reset the alarm. He brought up a ladder, and silenced the lobby alarms by pulling out the batteries or disconnecting the alarm wires. Again, not the way the system is likely designed to operate and function. The entire scenario made us feel that the hotel and staff are very ill-prepared, and poorly trained to respond to an actual life-threatening emergency. He, finally, explained that one of the guests was smoking in the room and set off the smoke detectors. We returned to our guest room after spending approximately 1 hour in the lobby with alarm sounds. No real apology was ever offered, and we asked whether the desk would instruct that guest that smoking was forbidden so that the alarms would not reoccur. We found it nearly impossible to fall back asleep. It made the following day in Venice most difficult and much less enjoyable as we had not slept the previous night. After writing the above complaint to the hotel manager, he apologized and offered a free night's stay the next time we're in Venice. I replied twice asking for compensation instead, and was told the hotel owner would need to make that decision.

It was definitely beyond what we would normally pay for a hotel, however the photos and their website looked so appealing we figured we would splurge for a three-night stay. After all, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Venice, right? My husband and I are both architects and we wanted to stay in a place that told up something about the city, and gave us a feel for the character of the place. The staff was charming when I made the reservation, stating in an email, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6We will do all our best to fall in love your children with Venice!!!!!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We parked our car at the Tronchetto, took the people mover to the Piazzale Roma, and caught the vaporetto to the Ponte Rialto. After getting turned around once, we found our way to the hotel without too much trouble. The hotel sits back at the edge of the Piazza Santa Maria Formosa, a lovely, quieter piazza very conveniently located about a 5 minute walk from San Zaccaria, and maybe a 7 minute walk to San Marco. The lobby is elegant without being stuffy, and it actually has a gondola stop at the back of the space (unfortunately it is only available in the winter when the canals are higher). There is a gondola stop right on the piazza Santa Maria Formosa, for those who are interested (I recommend going in the morning, when the canals are quieter, the light is soft, and you can get a feel for the real life of the canals as neighborhood streets). As we were traveling with our children, we booked the Formosa Suite which consisted of two large rooms on the third floor with a long balcony fronting the Piazza (normally the children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room is a common lounge for the floor). The rooms were absolutely gorgeous! It was obvious that the Ruzzini family, having had three Doge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the family, had done well for itself and it showed in this ancestral home. The 12\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 high, heavy-beamed, uplit ceilings provided the required gravitas, and the obviously old, original paintings made everything seem very luxe and special. There are other large drawings rooms in the building (one with a grand piano), that allow you to imagine them full of people during their heyday. Looking out over the piazza from our balcony felt very papal indeed, and the piazza was very low key. We enjoyed watching the local children kick a soccer ball around the square as much as we enjoyed watching the other people watching. The staff was excellent, snappy and professional. Breakfast, while not extensive, was very nice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the prosecco is a nice touch - and certainly more than enough fuel to spend the next eight hours walking through the alleys and closes of the city. I would absolutely recommend the Palazzo Ruzzini again.

The hotel is very well appointed, very clean and comfortable. Many of the rooms have fantastic windows that overlook the square and even those at the back overlook a canal where you can watch gondolers pass by regularly. The hotel also has its own water taxi stop, from off the reception area, so although these are not cheap, this makes it very convenient to get about or return to the airport. All the staff are smart and efficient and speak excellent English. I travelled with my mum and hoped I had chosed somewhere of decent quality. I am normally particular about where i stay and await being shoed to my room with fear and trepidation. On arrival we were greeted by reception staff who were smart efficient and very courteous, they made us feel valued and welcome and I was soon ceratin I had made the right choice. The room was large and clean and had all the usual facilities mini bar etc. The beds were rather firm but certainly not worn out and saggy. The hotel has a small breakfast area and the freshness and quality of the food was excellent. The hotel has a small bar serving hot, cold and alcoholic drinks and a small selection of snacks. The atmosphere was one of peace and calm, a haven after a hard days sight seeing. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone however particular and would return there without any question should I visit Venice again.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middletown, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "Mfest19", "ReviewID": "UR115465505", "Content": "This is a good clean hotel with a comfortable bed, nice bathroom and helpful waitstaff.

We chose the Ruzzini Palace hotel based on other reviews, so feel we should give our update. My husband decided he wanted some space on this holiday, so booked a junior suite in advance. As he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d pushed the boat out on the room, I wanted to push out the boat literally on the transport. We arrived by water taxi from the airport. 110 Euros \u00e2\u20ac\u201c booked at the desk near arrivals. It was a v fast and thrilling journey (15 mins) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c felt like I was in a James Bond movie! Although, admittedly, I was v relieved when the boat entered the quiet canals and slowed down. It was very exciting getting off the boat and stepping into reception. We were taken straight to our room which was lovely and cool. I have never slept in a room so tall \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least 4m in height. Felt very grand. The strange thing was the floor, which sloped. The effects of age and sinking? D\u00c3\u00a9cor was beautiful, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure about the fusion of the old room and the new bathroom \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpod\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. We were a bit disappointed to discover that there was no food available in a 4star hotel between breakfast and 4pm. All we wanted was a quick sandwich, but the bar only did snacks from the afternoon and room service wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t available until the bar started serving the snacks. Not to worry, the reception desk gave us directions to a nearby caf\u00c3\u00a9 serving snacks and pizzas. We spent the first afternoon/evening on foot in order to get our bearings. The hotel really is only 5-10 mins walk to St Marcos or the Rialto, depending on how many photos you take along the way! From there, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really easy to pick up a vaporetta. We bought a 36hr pass and used them extensively \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for trips to and from places and to journey up and down the Grand Canal. At first, the hotel staff kept trying to get us to go on a personal boat tour and a glass factory tour, but after a couple of refusals they stopped. They offered to organise a gondola from the hotel, but it seemed very expensive. We took one from Rialto, but that seemed pretty short too. The best bits were the side canals, so it would be worth looking into a pick up from the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or checking out the gondolas near the bar/church. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t compare prices/routes, which in hindsight we should have. It was a unique and priceless experience anyway. Breakfast in the hotel was good, but nothing exceptional. Waiters were a little overworked so you had wait patiently for refills of any food that had run out, or to get a table one morning. For me, the styling of the hotel and its location were the biggest advantages. Reception were v helpful in booking us tables in restaurants and organising a water taxi back to the airport. Unfortunately no-one on our flight to share the cost, but the hassle and time saved was worth the 100 Euro door-to-door cost. The only blot on an otherwise perfect stay was the fire alarm going off at 2:30am on our last night. A false alarm, but it went on for ages and stopped me getting my final night of perfect sleep in the big bed with beautiful linen. The Ruzzini was a real treat.

On arrival our reception was not as welcoming as we had been led to believe. The receptionist was only interested in selling us tours and lost interest when we told him this was not our first visit to Venice. We had an upgrade to a room overlooking the square which was adequate but hardly up to the glowing reviews and certainly not 5 star. rather gloomy and a very hard bed. The cleaners did a wonderful job and could not be faulted. The breakfast was no more than adequate, same thing every day without any variation. The orange juice was awful, watered out of existence. You had to buy squeezed orange juice from the bar. tea making faciities did not include coffee. We had to buy instant coffee and fresh milk. the milk they supplied (on request) was UHT.) The waiters were a little friendly and the cleaners also. 2 receptionists (Mario and the young man with the red hair and beard) were the only ones who were helpful and friendly. The tall guy with the glasses on was downright miserable. The hotel is very interesting but generally does not warrent all these rapturous reviews. I can only think that they have not experienced 4 or 5 star hotels. Venice itself is not the Venice that we knew 7 years ago. I know it is in a state of being restored and that can not be avoided, it badly needs it, but the masses of people arriving on the cruise liners is apalling. Everwhere is crowded from dawn to early hours of the morning. I'm afraid we wont be going back to Venice. It is so expensive, can you believe 1 euro 50 cents to use a loo.

The hotel is in a nice area and was accessible by water taxi. It is a bit far from St Mark's Square though. All of our tours met and left from St Mark's. Fortunately we walked there the night before, so we'd know where to go. It is also a long walk to the Rialto bridge. There is a bank/ATM in the square right outside the hotel. They also have a flea market in the square. I think it's every weekend. Breakfast was good (for Italy). I missed my hot American breakfast though. BTW the red juice is blood orange juice. I was surprised at how many people have never heard of a blood orange. I would recommend this hotel. Although if we get to go again, we'll probably stay somewhere a little closer to St Mark's.

The hotel is lovely; a very nicely converted palace with a beautiful entrance area and a nice bar/breakfast area. We stayed in a spacious deluxe room on the 6th floor which gave us views over the Campo Santa Maria Formosa (so as a result, the church bells did keep us awake on occasion) but was very comfortable and spotlessly clean.

When we arrived I had to argue with the reception staff member until he (reluctantly) agreed to let me have 24 hours free access (when we were booked in the hotel for three days). Needless to say, no free welcome drink was forthcoming. Why advertise these 'extras' if you are not going to honour them? (Free wifi really should be a standard feature of any good hotel in 2010.) I didn't need a drink and would not normally expect one but given that it was prominently advertised it made me feel peevish when it wasn't forthcoming.

The location is wonderful because it is a short distance to The Rialto and St Marks Sq. The rooms are wonderful for their size and appointments. There is plenty of open space too but without the feel of a huge hotel. On both of our stays our rooms were wonderful! The only 2 suggestion would be to have super luxurious matresses to go with the feel of the hotel but they were nonetheless a notch above most. Secondly a bigger bar of soap for the shower instead of the same size as for the sink.

My only criticisms would be that 1) as beams adorned the ceiling, the room had no ceiling light and, as such, was quite poorly lit esp in the evenings and 2) due to the design of and natural slope of the building, when walking close to the windows the floor shook slightly. Even with this in mind, we had peace, quiet and comfort and good breaksfasts every morning. The hotel can arrange most things for guests inc. water taxis to Marco Polo Airport, advice and bookings re Gondola's/motor boats and even run a private complimentary water taxi service to the island of Murano (but be prepared for the hard sell re buying glass and crystal). They also run a return boat service back to San Marco from Murano. If you want to look around the island you'll have to take the public waterbus back.

As one who enjoys both traditional historic and also modern hotels, I was eager to experience the morphing of the two styles at one property. When well done, this can be an exceptionally stimulating and appealing environment. The property appeared in some way, a bit \u00e2\u20ac\u0153souless\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for me (and I really appreciate minimalist modern architecture so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that it was too modern). The hotel photos give the impression that the public spaces and rooms are enormous, which they are not- at first I almost thought I was in the wrong lobby! We arrived early and were treated to cappuccino (gratis) in the bar area and were upgraded to a room on the upper floor (coincidentally the one that I actually wanted from the website) with small windows but a lovely view toward San Marco. The bath was small but adequate by European standards and the overall feel of the room was both rustic and modern which we very much appreciated. Being newly converted, the finishes are all neat and clean as anticipated although there appeared to be some wear on the room carpet. We visited the beginning of December and the hotel was almost empty which may have contributed to a sense of vacuity which the hotel seemed to have for me. The plus side was that we had the desk staff to ourselves and used their knowledge to experience more than we would have been able on our own- not sure if this would be the case in high season. The hotel has continually increased in its rating and although it is an exceptionally nice property, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that it deserves to be ranked so high compared with the other hundreds of options in Venice. For an off-season rate it was a steal (not sure if these deals are available any longer). Since I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a huge breadth of knowledge about the hotels in Venice, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go wrong, but I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fret if you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to stay here- unless you can opt for one of the giant suites.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harrogate", "Title": "\u201cAaaaah\u201d", "Author": "Fred_the_needle", "ReviewID": "UR82589853", "Content": "Great hotel, great location (but ask at reception for a map, the ones in the rooms are too small), great staff.

It is costly, and most of the hotels that fall into this category are indeed grand, but also dark and worn around the edges. This hotel solves that problem by offering you the best of both old and new architecture, and design. The hotel is located on the edge of a large open square in an overall quiet location. It is an easy walk to the main sites of Venice, provided of course, you do not get lost in the maze that makes the city so charming and special. On the backside of the hotel is a canal, which means the hotel has its own dock that is entered through double doors in the small stylish lobby. The classic Venetian structure is attractive with a grand salon room on the second floor complete with beautiful Murano chandeliers. We stayed in a junior suite which was very nice and impressive looking. The large one room suite was in a corner on the backside of the hotel. From the side window we could see the bell tower in St Marks Square, and a bridge over the canal. The two windows that directly fronted the canal did not provide a view of the canal because the windows had deep ledges, so we could not lean out far enough to see the canal which was close to the building. Regardless, the side window\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view more than made up for it. The room had lots of features not found in most hotel rooms including a twenty foot beamed ceiling. The walls were fabric covered with nice art work hung on them. White modern furniture filled the room, and abundant lighting offered different mood settings. As with many Venice hotels, the floor was a speckled stone. A nice desk area was tucked away in one corner. The bathroom was an oval shaped room that you actually could almost walk completely around, not attached to an outside wall of our room, directly behind the bed. The bathroom itself was nice but did not have any wow factor compared to the room. It also had a glass panel that was too small so it did not hold the water back during a shower, resulting in a wet floor. It should be noted that each room in the hotel is different in size and ceiling height. Also the square in the front of the hotel attracts young kids that play soccer after school, and we wondered how that affected rooms overlooking the square. We had breakfast each morning at the hotel. The buffet breakfast was basically the standard European breakfast and it is served in two rooms off the lobby that are modern and nice looking. The first of the two rooms doubles as a small bar that is available to guests until about 11pm. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful and always willing to provide the information you need. Through the hotel we arranged for a tour of a Murano glass factory, taking the the factory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private boat directly from the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dock. We also splurged taking a water taxi to the airport which was fun and one of those memorable experiences that we were very glad we did.

Totally fascinating - some days I didn't want to leave the hotel as there was so much variety of life passing the window of my room! The bedroom was very comfortable - no storage space but we had a separate dressing room with a safe in the wall. Breakfast was lovely and plentiful - gorgeous coffee and warm croissants and the best scrambled egg I've ever tasted.

There were great reviews on Tripadvisor, but no mention elsewhere. I thought that was strange but the reviews were so glowing and the price so competitive that I booked here. When we arrived at this beautiful building on the Campo S. Maria Formosa, I found the answer to the puzzle. The hotel only opened two years ago! Since then it has garnered almost 200 reviews, most of them \"excellent.\" I am happy to say that these reviewers were absolutely right. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a friendly and helpful reception staff, all of whom speak excellent English. We booked two rooms, a double for my husband and myself, and a junior suite for the young adults. You don't spend a lot of time in your hotel room in a place like Venice, so the fact that our double was small and dark didn't really bother us much. The bed was very comfortable and it was spotlessly clean. The suite, on the other hand, was absolutely beautiful, with 15 foot ceilings and more than enough room for the third bed we needed. The hotel's public spaces were tastefully furnished and evocative of an elegant past. Breakfast was served downstairs in the small bar area, and was very nicely done. A minor gripe: I personally hate paying for internet access and the hotel charged 12 euros a day for it. One of the nicest features of this hotel was its location. Venice in the summer is full of tourists and the narrow streets around San Marco can leave you feeling jostled and frayed. The Ruzzini Palace is very close to San Marco (10 minute walk), but in terms of the crowds, it feels like a world away. The campo is a large open space with a lovely old church and a few cafes. No trinket stores and no crowds until you get to the calles that branch away from it. What a pleasant way to experience Venice!

We found the hotel on TripAdvisor and booked 3 nights. This was my 5th trip to Venice and we wanted a quiet hotel not too far from the \"action\" in Venice (I.e Canale Grande, St. Marcus Square and the Rialto Bridge). Arrived by boat-taxi (approx \u00e2\u201a\u00ac70) and was greeted by the professional and friendly staff speaking fluently English. The rooms were gigatic with 6 meters or more to the ceiling, boasting great taste, charming decor and just plain enjoyable. For a hotel without a real restaurant (you can however get an excellent breakfast) and with no spa / fitness facilities the Ruzzini Palace ranks very high on my list of hotels I have visited through the years. It's quiet, well run and situated in a great location on a small piazza, from which you can reach The Rialto Bridge or the St. Markus Square in 5 minutes (walking naturally - it's Venize). We asked for recommandations for a nice and good place to dine and were recommended two restaurants. Again the staff was spot on. The dining for the 3 night we visited Venice was fantastic (quality food, great wine and charming setting). So if you're visiting do not hesitate to ask for nice places to dine. We also asked the concierge for help with a gondola and that was arranged and prepaied from the front desk. The price is approx \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100 and eventhough it may sound a bit \"kitch\", do not cheat your self out of this true Venezian experience. If you're visiting from the US and have tried the gondola trip at the Venezian in Vegas, you should definitely try the \"real-thing\" here in Venice. We checked out and left with the boat-taxi which came promptly when ordered at the front desk with great memories of Venice and a very charming hotel at a nice location. You will not be dissapointed staying here! PS: Previous to your arrival by car - call the hotel and have them book a place to park at the private garage San Marco - but call well in advance of your arrival. Otherwise the public parking is not bad at all and they normally have amble availability. And when in Venice, take the Vaporetto (line 1 or 2) all the way around the Venezian bay. That way you will see the city from a distance and close up when travelling through Canale Grande.", "Date": "August 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in a great location in a great city\u201d", "Author": "AAA04", "ReviewID": "UR73952093", "Content": "This is a great modern hotel close to the main attractions in Venice, such as the Rialto Bridge and St Marks Square.

A cool haven in the bustling and jostling of Venice in July. You do need a map to get there. If you follow the instructions on their website, you can find Ruzzini Palace fairly easily. You can also pay a gondolier about 80 euros (7/10) to take you there. Simone at the front desk was really kind and helped me with a restaurant, calling a water taxi, and letting my family tour the palace (it is stunningly beautiful, with fairy glass chandeliers), even though I had checked out by the time my family showed up (we were going on a cruise, and I had come before them). The room I had\u00e2\u20ac\u201d103\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhad two small balconies which overlooked a canal frequented by gondolas. Just watching the slow passage of tourists was a dream. It was a large room for one or two, with a great shower and big flat screen TV and elegant furnishings. I even took a picture of the actual floor because it was like a smooth slice of composite marble or granite with mother of pearl glinting every now and then as I walked from the closet around the room to the office space where there was a mini bar and makings for tea and coffee. The hotel was so peaceful after the mania of San Marcos Square and because I was clueless enough to haul my luggage there. Had I realized how many stair-step bridges there were, I would have paid the gondolier. I will next time. The breakfast was wonderful, and I wished that I had booked longer than one night.

What a perfect location. The plaza has tons of eating places and so much goes on there. The hotel is within walking distance to everything. San Marco plaza and the Ponte Vechio are only a short 5-7 minute walk. This is also one of the few hotels that faces a plaza, but also has the back of the hotel on a canal. This is a huge plus as you can take a water taxi that can stop at the back of the hotel and you never have to drag your bags around the streets going or coming to the hotel from the airport or train station. Good if you have a lot of luggage that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very portable or if walking is a bit of a challenge. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s door to door service! We took a Vaporetto (water bus) from the airport to the hotel. The vaporetto was cheaper than a taxi (only 13 euros per person from the aiport, as a private water taxi from the airport was 100 euros) We got off on the Rialto stop, and walked about 5 minutes, but had very portable bags. Checking out of the hotel, we had to go to the train station and decided to try a water taxi as the train station is closer. The hotel called us a water taxi and it was 70 euros. It was a such a plush water taxi that had beautiful woodgrain and was pristine inside. The location is perfect as you are in a square. A couple streets down is a small grocery store and also a self service laundrymat which we used. If you go there, they will wash your clothing for you for a small fee or you can do it yourself. We travel very light, so we found this very helpful. ROOM: First of all, the rooms are immaculate and clean with tons of light. Ceiling to wall windows with beautiful fabrics and wall treatments. We had room 302 which had a queen bed and single bed and also the connecting room (which is beautiful living room). They made the living room sofa into a king bed so that there was space for 4 of us. Together the two rooms were like an opulent apartment and we did feel like we were in a palace. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Square Suite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd faces the square (Santa Maria Formosa) and the square suite has THE ONLY Room BALCONY facing the square. The other balcony is a common area in between hotel rooms. My kids felt like royalty going out onto the huge balcony and looking at the square. If you get the suite that faces the canal, I am sure it is nice too, but the canal is so narrow, that you pretty much see the next building more than anything. The view out of our window went all the way to San Marco Square. Amazing. The main room also had a small dedicated office area. Basically a long desk that was behind the queen bed. My husband used this when he had to take a couple calls and hook up his laptop. If you need internet connectivity, they give you a card you purchase for either an hour or 24 hours. This is pretty standard. BATHROOM: The bathroom is very nice, although no windows. It is right as you walk in the door to the room and the rest of the room surrounds the bathroom. BREAKFAST: Breakfast was wonderful and huge! It is in a very bright room and it is much more than a continental breakfast. Every morning they had scrambled eggs and bacon, in addition to everything else you would expect (yogurt, pastries, toast, cereals).

The directions and maps were difficult to understand so I was constantly lost trying to find my destination and the hotel. The complimentary water taxi to Murano led me into the standard glass blowing demonstration then to a high pressure salesperson trying to sell products in his showroom for prices that exceeded the prices on Venice!

My Husband booked this as a surprise trip for my birthday and what a celebration it was! Our Junior Suite (201) was amazing with beautiful views over the Square. It was the biggest room we have ever stayed in with a huge bed, comfy chairs and a fantastic fresco ceiling. There were tea making facilities, a fridge, lovely toiletries and even bathrobes and slippers. Just round the corner from our room was an exquisite salon together with grand piano. Each side of the salon had a balcony one overlooking the square and the other overlooking the canal where you can watch the gondolas going by. All of the staff are friendly and welcoming and want to make sure that you have a memorable stay. As the hotel is small you do receive a personal service and it is not too grand that you feel intimidated by either the surroundings or the staff. We found the breakfast excellent and it was great that it was served until 10.30 am. The hotel is about 10 minutes walk from San Marco and the Rialto Bridge. These are best visited in the late afternoon when all the day trippers have gone and an air of quietness descends. Apart from these touristy areas there are many other lovely areas to explore and to discover. Head off with your map but expect to get lost some of the time and you will stumble across some amazing finds that most tourists never get to see. After doing so much walking we found it wonderful to return to the Ruzzini Palace to relax and unwind before going out for an evening meal. There are a number of restaurants a short walk from the hotel. We enjoyed the Trattoria Agli Artisti which is across the Square, over the bridge and a little way down on the right. Most of all we enjoyed the comfort and facilities at the Ruzzini Palace and highly recommend this fantastic hotel which certainly had the wow! factor for us.", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel and staff did all they could to make the stay memorable\u201d", "Author": "Smokeyrobbo", "ReviewID": "UR66055533", "Content": "Booked purely on the basis of previous reviews here on Tripadvisor and I'm happy to say the hotel did not dissappoint.

However....... Unfortunately, we were meant to travel from the UK to Venice in January this year but due to snow we had to cancel and we had to cancel the room at the Ruzzini as well. The staff who dealt with the cancellation were very helpful and understanding and also promised a very good deal if we rebooked with them. Which they came through on when I rebooked for March. Which I don't think I would of got if I didn't book directly with the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel (we had no trouble finding it, walking) we were met by friendly, enthusiastic and helpful staff. We were told (and we couldn't quite believe it) we were upgraded to the best room in the hotel, the Royal Suite (\"if you don't like it we've got no better\" he joked). Myself and my wife were absolutely gobsmacked by the room we were shown to. It was huge by comparison to most hotel rooms let alone rooms in Venice. Beautiful decor with an original stucco ceiling and art work on the walls. Massive bed, the temperature of the room was perfect, everything was just perfect! The view was out on to the picturesque square in front of the hotel. The room was very quiet and very relaxing. They also provided a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine upon our arrival. Although, the hotel did not have a restaurant they provided us with some great suggestions for places to eat and we had lovely meals and great service. I would recommend that you try their recommendations. Breakfasts had everything you could want fruit and yogurt, to continental, to Eggs and Bacon. It's great to know the hotel is brilliant when things go right and when they go wrong (no fault of the hotel see above flights in Jan), there was also a general strike in Italy on the day of our departure. The staff kept us up to date with any problems, helped us with alternative travel arrangements. In the end the strike didn't really affect us too badly, but it was great to know that the hotel was so helpful. Our flight wasn't until 5 in the evening with check out at 12.

The Chef Concierge, Michele Vianello, was wonderful. As were the other concierges we spoke with. Unfortunately, we forgot to get the other names. The lady that served us breakfast in the morning was so friendly and helpful. She anticipated us coming and had the coffee we liked ready. The breakfast was great and the coffee was awesome. The rooms were very spacious (we were all four in one room). The staff was very accommodating and added two extra beds to our room for the kids. We still had plenty of room. The view from our balcony of the square was beautiful. We left our car at San Marco parking garage and took a private water taxi (70 Euros) to the hotel lobby. I highly suggest doing this! It is well worth the 70euros! It is 70eruos total for everyone in your group, you can always split the cost if you have other adults along. Michele helped us in the morning planning our day. The hotel gave all of us a free trip to Murano and a private tour of the glass factory there. I asked Michele before we took the trip if there would be pressure to buy anything.

The glass factory gives the free tour so you can see the difference between their good glass and the glass from China sold all over the Island. The free tour was wonderful. They picked us up in a private water taxi, took us on a our tour the Grand Canal, and then to Murano. The glass tour was so fun. They gave both of my girls a free glass horse they had made for demonstration. We never felt any pressure to buy anything. They were very, very nice. Definitely do the tour!!!! The beds were nice, the tv was a big flat screen, honestly, everything was perfect!!! The price for this hotel was really good. We compared several hotels. This hotel was way nicer than some of the more expensive hotels. We are living in Switzerland and hope to come back every year for the next few years. There is always something new to see and discover in Venice. We will always stay at our favorite Venetian hotel.

The easiet way to the hotel is by water taxi but this is very expensive. we arrived via the orange line Alilaguna and got off at Rialto bridge. The hotel web site has directions from here which were very clear and took us straight there within 10 minutes. Initially we were given a room on the top floor . The room was very nice , clean and large enough but as it was in he roof it had no view at all. you had to climb on a chir to see out . we spent one night in this room and discovered that despite it being february and 0 degrees outside, our room was an oven. the air con/ heating was turned off at our request but despite keeping the windows open it was still over 25 degrees c at night.needless to say this was not comfortable. we discussed the problem with the front desk and they tried to rectify it with the central control system but when this did not change the temperature they could not have been more helpful and offered us another standard room. this was on a lower floor and was definatley cooler. when we actually came to move rooms we were shown to a diferent room which turned out to be a junior suite, did we want to move to this one? of course we did, it was devine. The staff could not have been more helpful throughout our stay both rooms were spotless and the porter very knowledgeable as well as all on the front desk. A day after our heat issues we overheard another couple complianing to the front desk about the heat and they too had loft rooms so if you do stay here and are offered a loft room be warned that for some reason they are very hot. Breakfast was a little limited in range if you want something even just a little healthy, very indulgent on pastry and croissants but all fresh and tasty. there is no reasturant here for eveing meals but there are many eateries around to suit varied budgets.

Breakfast is simple but adequate - Italy is not known for its breakfasts, so save your appetite for an exquisite lunch or dinner elsewhere. The room was beautiful - old (I assume preserved) woodwork mixed with modern touches, and a completely modern and very clean bathroom. Our room even had a walk-in closet/private changing area - a delightful touch, especially for the ladies with luggage :-)! And if you have some extra time, do explore the hotel! There's a really beautiful sitting room on the 2nd or 3rd floor with gorgeous ceilings and a grand piano. The staff is very professional and somewhat old-school (in a very good way). They aren't there to chat you up and make small talk, but always ready to help and answer questions and make suggestions. All staff - concierge, hotel, restaurant, room - are very courteous and polite, friendly but discreet, and very professional but warm. It wasn't the most expensive, but also not the lowest in price.

We stayed here for four nights to celebrate our anniversary, and from the moment we arrived we felt at home. A piece of advice - if arriving from the airport, book a private water taxi - luxurious, but worth every penny, as the hotel is quite far from any vaporetto stops and will be a fair old trek with luggage, but the RP has a rear access directly on to a canal, so you will be from your flight to your room in 30mins. The place was beautifully decorated throughout, with a well balanced mix of modern and classical styles and decoration, without the overbearing and oppressive feel that seems to be the case when looking at traveller photos of other venice hotels - this was understated luxury. The room was by far the largest we have ever stayed in and was more a suite than a room, located at first floor over the breakfast room, overlooking the square. Again, the room was beautifully decorated, with a bathroom pod in the centre and enough space around about it to get lost in. There was complimentary prosecco ready-chilled in the room, along with a massive bouquet of flowers (which i had organised with the concierge prior to our stay) waiting as a surprise for my partner - the price of which was excellent value for the size and quality of the flowers - an example of just one of the touches that made this stay so special. Nothing could have been too difficult for the staff to arrange - they were always on hand and attentive, spoke perfect English and ensured that we wanted for nothing. They even managed to arrange a mobile hairdresser to come to our room for my partner on the night of our anniversary (we had a booking for dinner at Cipriani's - worth it for the meal, but stay at the Ruzinni) on a Monday night when every hairdresser in Venice is closed - this sort of attention to detail that makes this place stand out. Breakfast was better than most Italian hotel continental breakfast offerings, with bottles of prosecco waiting to be emptied, always a good start to the day. Although the hotel only has breakfast facilities, this is no problem, as there is a wealth of excellent restaurants in the vicinity - we tried Osteria Alle Testiere, again on the basis of the TA rating (#6 in Venice) and the fact that it is 1 min walk away from the hotel (restaurant is delightful but very small, so book in advance) - food was magnificent. Campo Santa Maria Formosa, the square which the hotel overlooks is picturesque and lively without being a tourist haven and is lively enough without becoming a noise nuisance - try to get a room with a view of the square, as we get the feeling that they are probably lighter (south facing) than other rooms. As for location, it couldn't be better - you are five minutes walk from all the major sights (as long as you don't get lost, but that is part of the fun and romance of the place), but it is not in the thick of san marco and the hustle and bustle of the cruise ship day trippers. Our advice is spend a day doing San Marco, then lose yourself into Castello or San Polo to get a true feel of Venice, and a day trip to Burano is a must. The hotel even arranges complimentary water taxi to see a glass blowing factory in Murano - bit of a con, but if you know in advance, it works in your benefit, just get the water taxi, do the tour, then if you don't buy, ask to get let out of the back entrance and make your way to Murano waterfront and have a wander, and get the vaporetto to other parts of the lagoon. Again, TA ratings didn't let us down - RP was #12 at the time of booking, and we're not in the least suprised that it finds itself #5 on the Top 25 Hotels in Italy chosen by Europeans in the TA Traveller's Choice Awards - our city break to Venice was magical, and this hotel was every bit as perfect as La Serenissima herself - stay here if you can", "Date": "January 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Western Australia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic value in central locale\u201d", "Author": "Sara3010", "ReviewID": "UR54449179", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Ruzzini Palace for six nights over New Year and were delighted with our choice based on Tripadvisor reviews.

The myth about it being smelly is not true, there are stinky parts but no more than any other city but the heat makes slogging around Venice all day and standing in overcrowded vaporetto long pretty hard work. If you can go in April or October then that's what we'd do next time. Allow at least \u00e2\u201a\u00ac35 per person for dinner each night (including kids), even if you only have pizza and spaghetti. That doesn't include wine. Even if you think the menu adds up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50, they will find a way to add charges for bread, coperto, table-cloth, salt & pepper, breathing space..... and you'll end up with double what you expected. If you're on a budget you're going to be eating from streetside windows flogging slices of pizza and tins of coke. Allow another \u00e2\u201a\u00acloads for entry tickets to everything you want to see and also for all those drinks you're going to need every hour if you're there in August. In brief, the city is expensive and can be done adequately in 3 days so don't stay there too long! This hotel is a converted palace and the work has been done very sympathetically. The combination of history with modern hotel facilities works very well. Our room was massive, in terms of both m2 and m3 with a ceiling height of perhaps 6m. I would say it had a definite air of luxury about it but was perhaps missing something when it came to comfort or homeliness. It was a little impersonal, like you were staying in an art gallery and not someone's home. The service was excellent from the front desk. Breakfast was okay, not great. Poor eggs, cheap juice, small room, slowish service. Not representative of the hotel generally. However, breakfast in Italy seems not to be a priority anywhere we stayed. Location of the hotel is fine and you can get to both San Marco and Rialto in about 10-15 min walk, although we liked the area around the Peggy Guggenhiem better so might go over there next time. Getting to the hotel is fun. We drove and parked in the garage San Marco (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac30 per day). From there you have a choice of a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac70 water taxi all the way to the hotel's canal-side entrance or a vaporetto ride to Rialto and then a 15 min walk with heavy bags over about 8 small bridges with steps. We chose the latter as I couldn't get my head around a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac70 taxi ride. It was hard work in that heat! There's no question this hotel is impressive and gives an appears to be very good value - a room in a palace for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac200 per night (what we paid anyway). I'm not convinced about the comfort factor though, nor about the location, so whether we would stay there again is debatable.", "Date": "August 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "palo alto ca.", "Title": "\u201cThe best\u201d", "Author": "LouisePaloAltoCa_", "ReviewID": "UR38446366", "Content": "We stayed at Ruzzini Palace Hotel for 5 nights and thought everything about it was great.

Venice is fantastic to walk by, and we just asked the reception personnel where to eat, and the restaurant recommendations were fantastic! The Hotel is near to the main attractions in Venice, 5min walk to St Marks Square and to Rialto Bridge. Very very good location.

I had booked a junior suite (room 301) about two months in advance and we were very happy with the room. The hotel is ideally located 5 mn from Rialto, and 5 mn from San Marco, but far enough from all the hassle of both places. It is located at one end of a large and beautiful square, Campo Santa Formosa, and if you are lucky enough to stay in one of the rooms overlooking at the square, the view is incredible. I have been in Venice twice and walked everywhere and I think it's one of the most georgous squares in the city. It is less touristic than San Marco, so there are a couple of excellent restaurants around, a supermarket.. The hotel itself: Excellent service, the clerks spoke italian, english, french, and were able to help us out and even recommend us with nice restaurants and even booked a reservation for us. The room was quite large but I think a bit smaller than international standards (it's quite common in Venice). The room was a mix with old fashion paintings and newly renovated walls, very high ceilings, Excellent huge beds, and we were offered a bottle of Prosecco. I highly recommend booking a room with the view on the square. On the other side, there is a small canal and I think another building across so I'm sure the difference of view is big. There is internet available for free in the lobby. The only disappointment was the breakfast: I think it's a bit cheap for a hotel that nice and expensive. It's just a standard breakfast with hot beverages, low quality juices, cereal, croissants, bacon and eggs, etc. It's basic, sufficient but I would have enjoyed more choice and better quality.
