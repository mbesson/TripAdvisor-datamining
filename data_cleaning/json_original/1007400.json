Almost nothing is a bargain when you visit Disney World, so when you find a hotel that is you have a tendency to jump on it and I'm glad I did. Normally we stay at Disney resorts when visiting but I decided to go for a cheaper option this time. I'm so glad I did because now I've found where I'll be staying whenever I come down which is usually a few times a year. We had an early flight and arrived at the hotel a few hours before check in being very tired, sick, & cranky and just hoping we would get to be checked in early. We had reserved two rooms and were hoping to have them connected. From the time we got to the front desk I felt like we were in a 5 star hotel for our well we were treated, almost like we were family members of management. We worked a lot with Chuck who I believe was the Resort Manager, he was amazing. They went out of their way to quickly get us into both our rooms and gave us connecting rooms which is what we were going for. Both our rooms were nice and clean, beds were super comfortable and our room was big enough for us. Bathroom was of average size but we found everything we encountered to be clean. The breakfast was good and always kept well stocked even when it was busy. The hotel was withing walking distance of a McDonald's & 7-11 and also a short drive to Disney. While the road in front of the hotel is busy, overall it's located in a very quiet area and we were able to enjoy a quiet's night sleep the entire time. I really can't say enough good things about this hotel and for the staff we encountered here. For the price we paid and the service we received it was 2nd to none and I'll be picking this hotel over the Disney Resorts in the future. Don't 2nd guess a decision to stay here, you won't regret it!", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Petropolis, RJ", "Title": "\u201cGreat Manager\u201d", "Author": "Cy40", "ReviewID": "UR128325365", "Content": "This is the 3rd time I've stayed at Destiny.

On trip advisor we saw that the hotel had ok reviews but they were from years ago, and its most recent reviews were much better. They offered shuttle service, free breakfast, proximity to stores and on Kayak.com we saw a very good deal of about $38 a night. We stayed at the Destiny Palms, from April 6 to the 12th. Upon check-in you must pay a resort fee of $3 per day for everyday you reserved. We were on the first floor, the room was really nice and clean. There was no noise levels to complain about either from outside or from neighbors. There was a coffee maker, a flat screen t.v, a big dresser, a microwave/oven, a mini fridge and a very comfortable king size bed with clean linen everyday. Being a little cautious on the previous reviews on TripAdvisor, about there being dirt or bugs nearby, there were none anywhere. The room was really clean everywhere. After unpacking we went to the pool area and its a very clean and decent size pool which we had almost completely to ourselves except for a little girl that was in the pool. On to the parks, everyday you must tell the front desk that you need a shuttle to the parks before 9p.m so that they can call it in.The hotel use a company called Fly Tours Limo. The drivers were friendly and courteous, but hardly ever on time. The first day there was a delay with the shuttle, but Chuck the manager was able to sort it out quickly. The hotel has a pickup at 9a.m from the front door and they pick up at the park at 10p.m. You might think that it is a lot of time from 9a.m to 10p.m to be in a park but trust us, there is a lot to see at each park. If you want a later pickup or an earlier pick up their is a charge, we paid twice or so for an earlier pickup from the hotel and we were charged $25 by the shuttle service. The hotel has breakfast served from 6a.m- 9a.m. They have pancakes, waffles, tea, juice, hard boiled egg, etc. You have to heat up the waffles and everything either on a microwave or on a toaster. Theres nothing bad to say about this hotel at all. The management, especially Chuck was very friendly and would take care of any minor problems that we might have had. The staff too was very friendly and helpful. Housecleaning came everyday to clean our room except for one day, but we didn't really need it but they left everything perfectly cleaned and restocked. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone trying to find a place to stay in their area.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cThey must pay people to put reviews on this website....not clean or nice\u201d", "Author": "PV4u2nv", "ReviewID": "UR127953481", "Content": "My wife and I were looking for a Disney weekend without spend a ton of money.

The sink fixture was not bolted down, mildew everywhere, dirt and grim in all corners of the room, plaster falling off the walls, and a dirty smell everywhere!

So I literally spent months reading reviews on tripadvisior about hotels. Once I had it narrowed down, I even took it one step further and called the local police department to see if these hotels were safe and if they were in a good area. This is why we decided to take a chance on the Destiny Palms Hotel. Coming all the way from Petersburg, IL, I was a little wary of some of the reviews I had read. But overall Destiny Palms didnt scare me like some of the others did and in the end I was SO glad I picked the right hotel. We stayed in Rm 310 from March 14th to March 26th 2012. Out the door, taxes, fees it was $753.67- to me one hell of a bargain for everything we got!! PROS of the hotel: ALAN was GREAT (the general manager)!! He went above and beyond to ensure our stay was pleasant. Having free breakfast everyday, having one less meal to make. My kids loved it!! (and they are all picky eaters). The outdoor pool was clean. Alan would even let my kids swim later at night as long as I was there with them. Having an on-site laundry was a blessing- I did so much laundry I was thankful we didnt have to go to a laundromat. They have a computer in the lobby you can use free of charge. The room was clean!!! Housekeeping was OUTSTANDING- they did a great job each and everyday. The kids wrote thank you notes that I know they really appreciated. The shower was big. There were four of us staying in the room and it wasnt cramped like I thought it would be. The refrigerator helped saved us alot of money. NO BUGS!!! The bed was comfortable. WE WERE SAFE!! Great location. We were 5 minutes from Disney and 20 from Universal. Loved the McDonalds right by it. And best of all, the room was modern. CONS of the Hotel: the ladies that worked the front desk were not very pleasant. They were not friendly and their customer service skills need much improvement. What they lacked the male staff made up for. The continental cereal says a name brand- when in fact they used a generic brand. Upon arriving there were black hairs on the toliet. The room was a little dusty. The smoke alarm went off in the middle of the night and made a loud beeping sound-the battery was eventually changed. At times the hotel does have a weird smell to it. The sheets were not form fitting. The refrigerator temperature could have been colder.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Crete", "Title": "\u201cVery, very nice!!\u201d", "Author": "Jennifer B", "ReviewID": "UR127221793", "Content": "We just got back a week and a half ago and stayed there for 5 nights.

So many reviewers commented that it is very clean, but we beg to differ. The shower had mold growing on the white caulking. The bathroom had an old, grimy feel. However, the sink, faucet, and countertop (located outside the bathroom) were quite clean and newer. The carpeting was worn and in need of replacement. With that said, this place is a good value for the area. It's conveniently located close to the Disney theme parks and to all the restaurants and fast-food joints on Rt. 192. Our room was small; it had two beds with very little room to walk around them. It was nice to have a mini fridge. Breakfast was included, but it was mostly pre-packaged carbs (pancakes, waffles, bagels, and muffins), along with cereals, packaged oatmeal, and cold hard-boiled egg. Not an inspired breakfast, but I did like the OJ. The small breakfast room was packed, with not a single open table for us (this was New Year's weekend). We ended up eating in our room. The reason I put \"hotel\" in quotes is that this place has the feeling of a motel with interior hallways rather than a standard hotel. This is an average-quality hotel with a below-average breakfast and a decent price.

It is an older building and it seems like they have done a lot of remodeling with more that can still be done. Some of the work looked like DIY home depot fixes such as the tape foam on the door jams. The manager was very personable and nice. One night there was an accident down the road and all the power in the area was out when we arrived from EPCOT. The manager came back to the hotel, met us at the door, and explained what was going on. Then he walked us to the room with a flash light. The power came back on shortly after that. They have a small breakfast area with a bunch of carb type stuff, bagels, toast, cereal, muffins, etc and they have hard boiled eggs that they serve right above a very tempting microwave. DO NOT PUT EGGS IN A MICROWAVE. There was a young English bloke who put an egg in the microwave and within 45 seconds there was a messy explosion of egg and yolk coating the inside of that microwave. The poor cleaning lady had a look on her face like \"please lord, not again\". But she kept a smile like a trooper as the guy apologized over and over. The room was very small. They do have some larger rooms that have two beds but for the king rooms I would recommend no more than 2 people since there is no place for a roll-a-way. The bed was very comfortable, it was a pillowtop mattress with nice sheets. The location was great with a McDonalds pretty much in the parking lot and a 7-11 at the corner. It's right on West Irlo Bronson so there's lots of restaurants you can hit on the way to the parks or coming back from the parks. There's a Target Store right down the street.

I looked all over various travel sites and all we found were run down cheap hotels with really bad reviews. This one showed up about a week before we were schedued to leave and we fell in love with it right away! With all hotels, there are good and bads. I will do my best to be as descriptive as possible on both. First, the bad... Location is ok, but beware the travel time to the parks. The easiest way to get to Disney is straight down 192 to World Dr. Since the hotel is on the extreme west end of 192, it does take a bit longer to get thru traffic, especially during morning rush. It took us almost 20 minutes each day to go the 3 miles or so to get to world drive because of all the traffic and lights along the way. Even coming back from the parks around midnight, the traffic was horrible. They do offer a shuttle. but it gets crowded and the times you have to come back from the park suck. They want you to be at the bus stop at like 5 pm each night or you miss the only shuttle that will pick you up. So you lose park time just to save driving time. Not a good trade off to me. Anyways, the rooms are on the small side, but if you are like us, we used them for less that 10 hours a day....long enough to shower and sleep and get up the next day and spent it in the parks, which was fine with us. The breakfast is good, as long as you get there early enough. There is only one microwave to nuke the waffles and french toast in, so there is always a line for that. But they do have 4 toasters, so you can do that as well. No fresh fruit, though.That would have been nice, but still a good breakfast! There was one night where about 5 people decided to camp out in the main hall right arcoss from our room and talk till almost midnight. I called the front desk like 20 times and it rang off the hook. I finally got someone and told them my situation, and they took care of it. The walls are paper thin. When the a/c was off, we could hear our neighbor sawing logs right behind our headboard like he was in bed with us! We thought it funny, and turned the a/c back on and it drowned out the noise. The shower could have used a little scrubbing bubbles for some mildew and it would have been nice to have had the sheets changed at least once while we were there for a week. The maid left an envelope on our desk every day for tips. I should not have to feel obligated to pay a tip or feel forced into doing it. If you clean the room properly and change the sheets, there might be something worth tipping, but do not shove it in your guests faces like it is expected. Do a good job, get a tip. nuff said. Now the good... I called the night before to see about an early check in and they said call in the morning to see if a room is ready. We did and they had a room for us, so we checked in that morning. The room we were given had 2 queen beds and I paid for a king. I went back to the desk and they corrected thier mistake right away and gave me a very nice king room. We dropped our stuff off and went right on to the parks. We came back, showered and settled down for the night. OMG!!! The beds are soo comfortable! My wife and I slept the very best in those beds that week. It is nice to come back to a comfy bed after 12+ hours at Disney. The room came with a fridge and toaster oven, so that helped keep food costs down as we brown bagged our luches in the parks and saved like $30 bucks a day in park food. Like everyone has said before, the front desk staff is awesome! They were very friendly and helped us resolve any issues we had. Overall, this hotel was a life saver as it came along at the right time and within our budget. I hope it pops up again as we will definitely be back!

On the day I was to check out my youngest son was ill and the general manager encouraged me to stay as long as we needed until he felt better without charge. This may have been just a few hours, but it was very much appreciated. The hotel is a small warm and very friendly place to stay. I found it convenient to Disney- very close to the Animal Kingdom and centrally located. Traveling alone with 2 young boys I liked the location. The value of the hotel can't be beat. I paid about $175 for 4 nights with our taxes and including a free breakfast everyday for all 3 of us. I would not have any problem recommending this hotel to any one looking for an unbeatable value without having to sacrifice in cleanliness, safety or convenience. When going to Disney if you are just staying for a few days or just looking for a place to rest this place can't be beat. I have stayed in some very nice hotels and didn't receive the service that I did here. I have checked into hotels and left because they were dirty or didn't feel safe even if it was only going to be for a night-that is not the case here. If I had to compare the hotel to a chain I would consider this to be very similiar to a Radisson on a smaller scale, but with more personal service. For the price I can't see how anyone could complain especially when visiting Disney-we just used the hotel to sleep in and have breakfast because we were so busy seeing all the attractions which is what we were there to see- Disney .If you need any information about the area attractions, recommendations for food or anything else the general manager and manager are very knowledgable and personable.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sarasota, Florida", "Title": "\u201cThe BEST stay of a lifetime\u201d", "Author": "drlwls6", "ReviewID": "UR115866616", "Content": "We went to Disney for the weekend and stayed at Destiny Palms Hotel and it was AMAZING.

I think most people tend to stay shorter periods of time but this hotel has everything you need to make it a perfect base if you are doing all the theme parks in the Orlando area, it is nearer to Disney parks than Universal, we travelled 3 times to Cocoa beach area and all highway links are just a few minutes drive away - it was easy enough to do even though we had no Sat Nav with us. Rooms are only small - our's had 2 double beds, but it was sufficient for the 3 of us. Bathrooms are just a toilet and shower with the sink/hairdryer being in the room but who takes a bath when staying in a hotel. The fridge certainly comes in handy for keeping your drinks etc cold and there is also a TV, small oven/grill, iron and ironing board, hairdryer and coffee maker in the room. The one thing that wasn't in the room was a safe to keep valuables in but the hotel reception held our passports in the hotel safe during our stay. Coffee available in the breakfast room at anytime of day - complimentary breakfast very basic - to be honest they could have done with some more variety or at least fresh fruit available as well as the selection of cereals, boiled eggs, waffles/pancakes/toast/bagels, we ate out most mornings - there is plenty of places in the area to eat (Ponderosa, Houlihans, Sweet Tomatoe, Sizzler) all open until at least 11/11.30am for breakfast as the hotel only serves breakfast until 9am and the breakfast room is survival of the fittest in a morning! When we did eat from the hotel breakfast we took it back up to the room. Hotel staff were very polite and Chuck and his staff bent over backwards to help you with anything you needed to know. All in all a pleasant experience - we found the hotel well located - plenty of supermarkets not too far away (Target and Walmart nearby and 7/11 right outside hotel) and also restaurant's galore right on your doorstep. This hotel is not the Ritz but is a whole lot better than many other Orlando hotels I have stayed in the past - comfy clean beds and clean towels, even towels for the pool if you asked.

My room on the 3rd floor had not been properly cleaned from the previous guest. The apparently fresh bed sheets had body hair and the toilet rim was soiled.The floor had also not been hoovered. I had to leave a note for the room maid as they had still not cleaned the toilet by the 3rd day. All the worktops / sink and desks were extremely dusty / dirty and these just did not get wiped. The iron board could not be used as it had been stained by either blood or a reddish food substunce. The shower had a nasty build up of dirt and grime on the shower heads/handles and door frames.

At the time I booked this hotel it was rated the #22 hotel in Kissimmee. I read all of the reviews good and bad. I read where people said the rooms are small and others said it was ok, I read how the pool was dirty and others said it was fine. I just spent an entire week here @ the Destiny Palms Hotel and I have realized this is probably the best worst hotel in Kissimmee hence why it has so many positive reviews. Let it be known that you always get what you pay for, I am always looking for a deal and I thought I found it with this Hotel, coming in much cheaper than other hotels in the same class with similar amenities. Let\u2019s start with the problems. On the day we arrived we were offered a choice of 3rd floor room or 1st floor room. Based on the reviews I chose the 3rd floor (room 320), less likely to have pests and away from the breakfast area. This was a positive choice as there were no pests in the room the entire trip. When we entered the room we realized that we didn\u2019t rent a hotel room we rented a walk in closet. Let me tell you that the room is small, do not take this lightly as in \u201call hotel rooms are small, how bad can it be?\u201d There is NO CLOSET in the ENTIRE room. In a rough guesstimate this room is about 250sq ft including bathroom. The room is DIRTY. There are many many stains on the headboard, none of the counters were wiped down, everything is covered in dust, and the two chairs are covered in stains. A toaster oven isn\u2019t really a great appliance and I would have preferred a microwave, but I knew this coming in. Now this being a small room there is a small armoire in the corner where you can hang a few garments of clothes and there is two small dresser draws in the bottom, I ended up living out of my suitcases which sat one on a dirty chair and another sat on a small table that housed a small coffee maker. My wife lived out of her suitcase, armoire, nightstand, and other miscellaneous draws. Also there is recessed lighting above the bed which is falling out of the ceiling. Next I went in to inspect the bathroom\u2026 Small is an understatement, I\u2019ve had bigger bathrooms on a cruise ship! When you open the shower door (which opens out) you have a couple inches of clearance with the toilet. When you get out of the shower you are going to be cramped with the sliding door closed you\u2019d be lucky if you could even turn around. Later in the trip around day 6 some black mold developed in the shower towards the ceiling. The exhaust fan was so loud it would have woken the dead. Next let\u2019s move onto the bed. The bed is a king size bed with sheets that clearly do not fit. The maid crew can make them fit when they make the bed, but as soon as you lay on it the sheets come off from the corners and you end up sleeping on the mattress during the night. The comforter was also stained. There is an ironing board on the wall, with an iron. The ironing board\u2026 yup you guessed it, also stained. The pool was extremely dirty and not use-able; there were all types of leaves and sticks in the bottom with algae growing. The pool had not been cleaned in what looked like months or weeks. The maid service\u2026 what a joke. They did not vacuum the entire time we were here. The only thing they did was replace dirty towels and make the bed. They never wiped down the counter, cleaned anything, replaced the sheets, nothing. Possibly the worst housecleaning service I have ever had in any hotel. I mean there is mold growing in the bathroom on the 5th night. On the night before we left they didn\u2019t clean our room until 5:00pm. On the 6th night someone was checking into the room right next to us at about 1:00am. Either they were just loud movers or the walls are paper thin. Also many parents letting their kids run up and down the hallway all hours of the night laughing and slamming doors. This isn\u2019t really the fault of the hotel, but they should take notice of such acts and act accordingly. On the first day after we were tired by the flight and wanted to relax, so we went to turn on the flat panel TV. Of course it was unplugged. So I plugged it back into the wall outlet (which was hanging out of the wall and was not secured at all). We turned the TV on and it was on for about 5 min and shut off. I turned it back on, and started changing the channel; at that point the TV locked up and emitted a loud screeching sound. We unplugged it and called the front desk they suggested trying it again which I did and it turned off again. Then they said the property manager would come up to inspect the TV. He again turned it off and back on. This as you can probably tell had no effect. It took the property manager about 8 hours to get us a new TV, and this one too had a problem with the volume. It goes up and down at random unless you put it in \u201cmono\u201d mode which you have to do every time you change the channel. Now I knew what was on the continental breakfast due to previous reviews but, I had no idea that the bagels would be stale, the muffins were so moist they were wet, the hard boiled eggs over cooked, the room was over crowded and dirty. Other little problems that I noticed that didn\u2019t affect my stay but may affect an others were there is a screw in the wall protruding from the wall and it is painted.

The beds were comfortable, and the property was quiet at night. There was also more than ample free parking. Breakfast got good ratings as well. They had toaster-ready waffles and pancakes, bread, bagels, cereal, and coffee and juice. Management was friendly and went out of their way to please. When we reported a phone in one room was not working, Chuck, the manager, installed a replacement phone within five minutes! The location was also ideal, out towards the western end of US 192, away from the constant traffic jams and congestion. We were able to enter Walt Disney World each morning through some convenient back roads and avoid all the traffic delays. The price was an exceptional value for our group, and we would not consider staying anywhere else near Walt Disney World should we plan any future trips to Florida.

This is a great, well run, inexpensive place to spend a few days while in this area, especially if going to WDW. The motel is located in a less hectic area of Kissimmee, a few miles west of I-4 off Route 192. It is about 1/2 mile west of FL 429 (a toll road) and is a little tricky to find--if going west you pass a Houlihan's on the left (purple neon around roof), then a McDonald's and 7-11, where you turn left and go about 75 yards to the motel on your left. Being off 192 seems to make it a quieter place to stay. It is just a few miles from Disney (you do not have to get on I-4)--go east on 192, then north on any one of a number of side roads that lead you up to Osceola Parkway or World Drive into any one of the Disney parks. The rooms were a pleasant surprise--we stayed on the first floor and the room had an excellent king sized bed with a pillow top mattress, refrigerator, toaster oven, coffee maker, iron and ironng board, hair dryer and a flat screen TV. There was no bath, only a very good shower. The continental breakfast was more than adequate with hard boiled eggs, a variety of cereals, bagels, pastry, juice, cofffee/tea and waffles and pancakes that you have to toast. The staff is pleasant, especially Alan, the general manager, who tries to make your stay very pleaant. Rates are very reasonable. The only glitch in our stay of 2 nights was the fact that the heater/AC controls did not work in the room. We discovered this late on the 2nd night and were not able to tell Alan until the next morning.

And that was one of the best decisions we\u2019ve made for our entire trip of two week stay in Orlando.

And the room was somewhat compact yet very clean with great mattress, lots of lights, all new furniture, drapes, and comforter, flat screen TV, microwave, small fridge and larger than average shower cubicle. The air conditioning worked perfectly with an individual thermostat. And we did accessed wireless internet from our room on the second floor without a trouble. Although 1800hotels. com offers two booking options of hot breakfast and continental breakfast with the rooms with different pricing, the hotel only offers continental breakfast. According to Alan \u2013 General Manager, the hotel never offered hot breakfast to their guests at all. However the continental breakfast had good variety of food and they had 24 hour tea/coffee available in the dining area too. If you\u2019re planning to maximize your days at the Disney parks and if you were to have children in your group, having this free breakfast option is a super value for money. And you always have the option of going for All you can eat breakfast buffets within few blocks from the hotel at $3.99 per person. Alan \u2013 the general manager was friendly and helpful (although he doesn\u2019t smile as much as the other staff members do !!). And both Eddy and Pricilla are generously courteous and extremely accommodating. And in Chuck, they have a \u201clive-in mobile Disneyworld & Orlando encyclopedia\u201d with them !!!. He is unbelievably knowledgeable about the whole set up of Disney World and other surrounding theme parks plus Kennedy space center. Even though we pre-planned our two week Orlando stay in great detail, Chuck\u2019s expert knowledge was extremely useful in getting around any bottle necks or finding good places to eat or advice on what we must not miss during our stay. And Chuck goes that extra mile to make sure every guest feels important and welcome at this place. What official role he plays in this hotel is not clearly displayed anywhere, but trust me, he is great asset to this place and to everyone who stays there. The hotel is a short drive to Disney world theme parks and about a 45 minute drive to Kennedy space center. If you pre-book, the rent-a-cars are fairly reasonable at around $15.00 per day. It is advisable to rent a car which could save you lots of travel time, especially if you\u2019re into park hopping. And it can also be useful in getting back to your hotel at 2:00 in the morning on the days when the Magic Kingdom closes at 1:00 in the morning..!! Destiny Palm Hotel is unbelievable for $31.00 a night!! Staff is so friendly that we felt like we lived here before. And are we going to stay here again? Of course we\u2019re, on our next trip to Orlando. And can we recommend this hotel to anyone?

I had put on hotwire that I had 2 children so therefore should not have been given a king size room. The blond guy working at the desk did not want to change it. However the man working next to him was very nice and changed it for me. We got in late. We have a baby that is almost two and a thirteen year old. When we got into the room the bed on the right side up against the wall next to the window had dirty sheets. When I called down to complain, they said to come down. I asked if someone could bring them up because at this point it was late the baby was crying and my son had went to get something. They were very nice and brought up the sheet. So I had to remake the bed. The next morning there were multiple roaches in the bathroom. When the baby was on the floor next to the light switch and the bed. There is not enough room for an adult to stand there, there was a cigar butt and an old stuffed animal and a dead roach. When the baby was over at the window she somehow messed with the ac. (This was my fault, I know so I dont blame the hotel for the part of the fire alarm going off) She had turned on the heater causing the fire alarm to go off again my fault for letting her touch any buttons. But we went to open the window on the third floor which is right next to the ac unit and the bed and there were no screens. This should be a violation of safety hazards. So when we went down to breakfast, I complained to Eddie who was the only nice person at the hotel. The person the night before who gave us the rooms I thought was nice until the following day. Eddie apologized and said he was embaressed on behalf of the hotel. I really felt like he had empathy and the problems were going to be resolved. He asked how could it be resolved and I told him by getting a refund. He said he would have to ask the manager but he was out. He would however phone him and find out. So we got in around 11 PM Saturday night. When we opened the door we found one bed made, the other bed unmade. My son did have a backpack on the bed but it is unacceptable to have an unmade bed. This was the bed that I had to make the night before. So then I checked and of course the roaches, the old stuffed animal, and the cigar butt was still next to the bed where they were left. I can maybe understand the stuffed animal in case the maid had thought it was ours. There was no screen on the window either. I noticed as we were leaving Sunday that none of the rooms had screens on the windows as I was looking from the outside. So I decided I would say something at check out to the person who was nice the first night and got us the two beds. When I mentioned it to him. His response was why didn't you call Hotwire the first night and make them move you to a new motel? I think this was horrible customer service. First it shows that he had no plans of making things right. Second, it showed he did not care about the customer and getting the customer to come back to the hotel. Now we live in Tampa and spend the night in Orlando frequently to go to Universal.
