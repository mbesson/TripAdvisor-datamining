I was in Istanbul in October 2011 and Hotel Ilkay is right on the main artery where the tram in Sultanahmet runs.

I remember liking the Turkish linens we slept on -- very smooth. There is also free wifi throughout, which was great bc we relied on it to keep in touch with folks at home, get the weather forecast, etc. The included breakfast spread was pretty good too (sure beats continental breakfasts in the US) -- we really enjoyed it all, and especially the dark tan / brown MOLASSES WITH TAHINI sauce, which we put on everything! The American coffee runs out fast, so be sure to arrive early if you can't stomach the Turkish grinds. When we told reception that we had a 5am departure flight, they did their best to pack us a mini breakfast to-go, which was very helpful. They also helped us arrange a taxi when our original departure plan fell through. Hotel Ilkay was part of a trip package deal, but I am pretty sure the usual price is pretty reasonable. It's the budget hotel within a group, so if you prefer something with more amenities, check out the \"Sirkeci Group\" links on their website.

The staff was wonderfully pleasant and accommodat\u00c4\u00b1ng and service was excellent for a budget hotel! Location: Istanbul is a big city, with serious traffic and distance issues, so location of a hotel is absolutely a priority if you do not want to spend hours in the traffic. Sirkeci, in my opinion, is the most convenient lodging district for sightseers on foot. First, Sirkeci is located between Emin\u00c3\u00b6n\u00c3\u00bc and G\u00c3\u00bclhane. Much of the old town including the Sultanahmet area and even Galata in southern new town can be reached on foot. Also, the T1 Tram line runs through the area, which provides easy access to the new town. Ilkay Hotel is well located in the S\u00c4\u00b1rkeci Distrist and many of the sights are within walking distance from the hotel. It is a clean budget hotel in Sirkeci district. Quoting a previous review: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It fills the budget hotel role among the Sirkeci Group of hotels and restaurants, and offers terrific location, great value, and friendly service to budget-conscious independent travelers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I completely agree with this. The hotel is near the historical places (Sultanahmet, Aya Sofya, Topkapi Palace, hipodrom etc). It is also near Eminonu where you can take a Bosporus tour or the boat to the Asian side of the city. There is even a colorful adjoined souvenir shop where we did a lot if our present buying! (Last minute purchases!!!) -Transportation the Hotel Istanbul has 2 airports. We arrived to the main one (Ataturk International in the European side) from where we got a free airport pickup (for booking three or more nights). We also got a 7% discount for paying upfront in Euro cash. - Staff/Reception The staff at the front -desk was very friendly, helpful and efficient. They made the bookings for a day-trip and a show. The registration process was quick. Always ready to give us information about places to see and things to do. - Rooms I booked two double rooms. Good size, comfortable beds. Rooms were clean and well maintained, Bathrooms were neat with some amenities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c shampoo, liquid soap, hair-dryer. TV with many international channels in English and French, German, Italian and Russian channels. - Breakfast Breakfast was very nice indeed! Fresh and tasty: several types of corn flakes, two type of cheese, fresh vegetables, cream, peanut butter, different sorts of bread, coffee, tea, juice, sausages, fruits, oriental sweets. Really great! Much better than in other hotels I have stayed in Istanbul! - Internet There is an internet station next to the lobby, which worked fine. Free Wi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Fi. - Atmosphere: The best! Family oriented. Special thanks for the hospitality!!! Turkish friendliness & warmness: I love it!

It fills the budget hotel role among the Sirkeci Group of hotels and restaurants, and offers terrific location, great value, and friendly service to budget-conscious independent travelers. Sirkeci, in our opinion, is the most convenient lodging district for sightseers on foot, even more so than the popular Cankurtaran (Sultanahmet) area. First, Sirkeci is located between Emin\u00c3\u00b6n\u00c3\u00bc and G\u00c3\u00bclhane. Much of the old town including the Sultanahmet area to the East, Grand Bazaar, Spice Bazaar, S\u00c3\u00bcleymaniye to the West, and even Galata and Karak\u00c3\u00b6y in southern new town can be reached on foot. Also, the T1 Tram line runs through the area, which provides easy access to the new town (Kabata\u00c5\u0178 Tram terminus is very close to Dolmabah\u00c3\u00a7e Palace and a short F1 funicular ride away from Taksim Square) as well as Grand Bazaar (\u00c3\u2021emberlita\u00c5\u0178 or Beyaz\u00c4\u00b1t stations). Ilkay Hotel is located on H\u00c3\u00bcdavendigar Caddesi (the Tram runs through this street), and both G\u00c3\u00bclhane and Sirkeci stations are just a couple of minutes walk from the hotel. This also makes the trip to/from the Atat\u00c3\u00bcrk International Airport (IST) easy; to go to IST, hop on T1 tram at G\u00c3\u00bclhane, and transfer to M1 Metro at Zeytinburnu. Finally, nearby Emin\u00c3\u00b6n\u00c3\u00bc is the hub for all those ferries to Bosphorus, Asian side, and Golden Horn, as well as a major bus terminal (there are buses for Ey\u00c3\u00bcp, Fatih Mosque, Kariye M\u00c3\u00bczesi, etc). Overall, Sirkeci is a better lodging location for seeing all of Istanbul and beyond, while Cankurtaran is more suitable for quick few-day trips confined within Sultanahmet area (for shopping/gourmet/business trips, though, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d consider the new town). Ilkay is very attractive value-wise. Its rate is highly competitive, and there are good special offers; free airport pickup for booking three or more nights, a family card that gives 10% discount at some of the Sirkeci Group restaurants (though we found that they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily among the best, and American Express can give the same discount), 1 night free for booking seven nights (i.e. paying for only six nights), and 7% discount for paying upfront in Euro cash. We took advantage of all of these to reduce the travel cost down to the level only some guesthouses could match. The hotel is also well-maintained; room was clean and quiet (apparently higher the better), staffs were attentive, breakfast buffet was satisfactory (not many items but generally good quality). For stocking up on water and snacks, there are three small marts just across the street. For those with a sweet tooth, the wonderful Turkish Delights (lokum) of Ali Muhiddin Hac\u00c4\u00b1 Bekir and baklavas of Haf\u00c4\u00b1z Mustafa \u00c5\u017eekerlemeleri are nearby, too. Sure, this is a small budget hotel. The elevators are so small that they fill up with three people or a couple with a suitcase. Room is air-conditioned but with very few amenities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c shampoo, liquid soap, hair-dryer, a small wall-hung TV, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about it. Bathroom is clean, but not particularly well-designed; at washbasin, we kept bumping our heads into an amenity tray, it was hard not to keep water from spilling onto the toilet paper hanger, and water leaked at shower head. Receipts are hand-written, and one front-desk position plays all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c receptionist, cashier, and concierge. However, none of the above small shortcomings distracted us from having a very satisfactory and pleasant stay. Everything from airport pickup, check-in, bookings for a day-trip and a show, to the last quick lunch at Red River, the hotel caf\u00c3\u00a9, went smoothly. And the most extraordinary thing was the level of commitment shown by many staff members and K\u00c3\u00bcbra, the guest manager. The front desk promptly checked our bathroom when we mentioned the leaking shower head (though it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t completely fixed). Housekeeping was consistently well-done. K\u00c3\u00bcbra gave a friendly orientation upon our arrival, asking our plans and giving advices. She would periodically check on how we fared throughout the trip. K\u00c3\u00bcbra and another staff member at night shift asked about our day trip and the show, and it was clear that they were genuinely interested in our satisfaction, a rarity even at luxury resorts. Ilkay is a budget hotel blessed with very good location, even better value, and some truly outstanding staff. Yes, there are hotels with much better fa\u00c3\u00a7ade and facility, with more elegance and sophistication, with lovely atmosphere and luxurious service, and with well-trained and disciplined staff. Ilkay does not enjoy all those, and has its rough edges. K\u00c3\u00bcbra and other staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s genuine hospitality, however, along with its attractive value, more than compensate the lack of some amenities and elegance. We had great overall satisfaction with this charming small hotel, and would not hesitate to book again were we to return to Istanbul. Maybe not a perfect five point, but very close to it (this is my first time giving a five in TripAdvisor). We recommend Ilkay to any sightseeing traveler who can overlook a little lack of physical amenities and formality for a warm demonstration of Turkish friendliness.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scarborough, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and location\u201d", "Author": "Sue D", "ReviewID": "UR118815984", "Content": "It was our first visit to Istanbul and we were not disappointed.

The complimentary airport pick-up was a huge relief and went very smoothly, spotting our driver holding my name as soon as we emerged from arrivals.

The room, itself, was clean, spacious and fully air-conditioned - we could not have asked for more and were expecting a lot less. On top of that, there was also a complimentary breakfast buffet, which was ideal for starting a long day of sight-seeing, complete with just-squeezed, fresh orange juice. The sheets and towels were changed everyday and the room always smelt so beautiful. I didn't spend enough time in the hotel to get to know all the staff but it was made obvious many times by themselves that they were there if ever we needed anything.

Istanbul is a really big city, with serious traffic and distance issues, so location of a hotel is absolutely a priority if you do not want to spend hours in the traffic. The Ilkay Hotel is located in a busy street in the Golden Horn, just a few minutes from the main attractions of the city, within walking distance. Hotel is basic but very clean with a great location. Some comments about the hotel : - Location The Hotel is located on a busy street in the Golden Horn , just a few meters away from the top attractions of Istanbul. You can walk to most of the attractions, To move further away , the tram runs in front of the hotel. Across the hotel you can find multiple restaurants, souvenirs shops,etc. -Transportation to /From the Hotel Istanbul has 2 airports. We arrived to the main one ( Ataturk International in the European side ). From there a taxi ride takes around 40 minutes to the Golden Horn. Note that the taxi driver might try to drop you 4 blocks away from the hotel, indicating that can not enter to the street of the hotel. It is not a big deal , but after a long light and with the luggage, is better to be dropped in front of the hotel. So check in advance with the driver ! On the way back to the airport, reception can order a taxi that will pick you up outside the hotel. - Reception The reception staff was very friendly and efficient. When I arrived, in 5 minutes completed the registration process, providing us maps and directions from the hotel. - Rooms I booked two double rooms We got rooms in the renovated area. The rooms were clean, good size comfortable beds, TVs. The bathroom is very clean also. Our rooms faced the street, which is really busy, but the noise was acceptable to have a good sleep. - Breakfast The hotel provides breakfast,, which has good options and the quality is ok. - Internet There is an internet station next to the lobby, which worked fine. - Atmosphere of the hotel The hotel is family oriented, so we felt very comfortable all the time. I would highly recommend the Ilkay Hotel in Istanbul , as you will have a clean place to stay, very close to the main touristic places and good value for your money !", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel for discover Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "lt1976", "ReviewID": "UR92383800", "Content": "Me and my gf stayed at Ilkay for 7 nights, January 2011, the best hotel for discover the city.

The hotel is located right in the middle of everything with the longest (and most useful) line of tram right in front of it and a tram stop at a 5 min walk. Shops and restaurants along the street and surroundings as well. It's a small hotel, rooms are quite small, but clean and there's a maid that comes daily to tidy it up. The air conditioning works which is a plus, if you visit Istanbul in summer and the windows stop any noise from the outside so you sleep pretty well. The bed, we had a double bed, not twins, is not too big but enough but they only put one sort of sheet on top of it that's quite small for the bed's size, but since it was summer it didn't matter too much. No blinds, just curtains that didn't cover the whole window but, again, we managed. TV was a small one but had like a million channels included some in english, german, spanish or french. The bathroom was very small, the light was not quite bright enough as well and the curtain on the shower didn't really stop the water from running all over the place, but, again, it was clean, we had warm water, clean towels, toilet paper and a hairdryer so it didn't matter much. The breakfast is quite decent, they have bread, juice, coffee, tea, ham, cheese, yoghourt, olives, tomato, boiled egss, sausages, etc so it was enough. We didn't encounter any problems with our luggage, simply left it closed everyday, or with buggs in the bedroom; that's something we've heard of other hotels. It's got wifi on the lobby but you have to ask for the password, it's supposedly free but we never tried it. The bar downstairs is nice as well and opens until late but so do the other million bars in Istanbul. So, as I said, it's not your type of hotel if you are looking for a lot of space and luxuries but if you are looking for a cheap (we paid less than 60 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac/night), clean and well located place, where to sleep, shower and rest, this is the one.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest", "Title": "\u201cGood location only\u201d", "Author": "Mishaella", "ReviewID": "UR76793439", "Content": "Strengths: - good location - clean - friendly staff Weaknesses: - no minibar or fridge in the room (you'll certainly miss it if staying there during summer) - deposit box only at the reception - the breakfast buffet is not refilled as often as it should - small rooms", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel in every way\u201d", "Author": "cotter_10", "ReviewID": "UR72818952", "Content": "Great hotel in great location, staff in both Red River bar and the hotel friendly and helpful at all times, especially Fatih K at reception, rooms comfortable and clean and good selection at breakfast, cant fault this hotel for service or price and highly recommend for anyones stay in Istanbul", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "hilalahmed44", "ReviewID": "UR72509150", "Content": "Front Office Staff: especially Umit and Fateh were extremely courteous, helpful and efficient.

Booked through City Break.co.uk as an inclusive booking, using Easy Jet and Ilkay. We used istanbulairportshuffle @ 10 euros each way. which worked smoothly for us. Had to wait for passangers who didn't arrive on the inbound journey (don' t you wish people would have the courtesy of cancelling if the change their mind), and one lady got on the bus for the wrong airport on the way back, didn't realise, and started shouting at the driver to let her off on the motorway - the company coped with both challanges smoothly, so I was quite impressed. Unlike the first impression of the hotel room ( keep reading, and the scoring will make sense!) We were given keys to Room 202. Now learn from our mistake; if you are given this room ask to change immediately, It is cramped, dark, has a flat roof and fire escape right outside the window, suffers from noise from the surrounding rooms airconditioning units without its own working, and worst of all, when you shut the window to go out, on your return there is a very unpleasent smell of mouldy damp ! So, after a sleepless night, we spoke to them, and without any arguement or even discussion, a new room key appeared, our cases were relocated, and a nice bright sunny Room 511 was ours! After 4 days of climbing 5 flights of stairs we did debate if that was punishment for wingeing about the first room but there was the alternative of a lift so probably not ! The lift was one of those funny ones with only 3 sides and a moving wall so it was our choice to walk those stairs. Gave us an appetite for Breakfast, which was served in a basement room; nice spread of fresh bread, white and yellow cheese, ham, tomatoes, egg, cereals and stuff. Hotel also has free safety deposit boxes behind reception, locked luggage room so you can store after check out, free internet computer in a little lounge, but most of all really helpful friendly staff, who we often heard advising people how to get around Istanbul, where to go and when etc. Overall we loved the location most of all. Istanbul may be built on 7 hills but you don't have to be amazingly fit to cope with walking a lot of it. We kept meaning to get on a tram but everytime I would say 'it's only a couple of stops from the hotel, let's walk'. Now the shoe leather did take some punishment on all those cobbles, in fact, we have a broken heel to prove it, and the feet are still throbing from two days later, but we really we able to work up an appetite by walking everywhere. We used the ferry to get across to Kadikoy but otherwise across to Galeta, Grand Bazar, Blue Mosque, Aga Sofia, Topkapi Palace, Cisterns, and the Park were all walked to easily. The hotel also has the Red River pub to collapse into on your return for a cold beer. Prices are not much more than anywhere else in Istanbul and it has a comfortable and relaxing feel. We never ate there so can't comment on that. So, would I recommend?

Really good quality, authentic food at sensible prices. The staff were very friendly too & even gave us complimentary apple tea. I'd advise against taking the Havas bus from Sabiha Gokcen airport into the city (10 Turkish Lira per person). It dumps you in the Taksim district and, when I asked the driver how to get to the Sirkeci district for the hotel, he just shrugged his shoulders. This is despite the same bus driver saying \"Sirkeci, no problem\" earlier! We had to then take a taxi to the hotel (a little under 15 Turkish Lira for the journey). It took 2 hours to reach the hotel from the airport. On the return trip, we used the Sabiha Gokcen airport shuttle white mini bus (we hadn't come across this at the airport, but had looked for it). You can pre-book your tickets from CNN Tours on the same street as the hotel (turn right out of the entrance & its a few doors down on the same side).

The location of Hotel is good. Its in the Sirkeci area which is short walk from Hagi Sofia/Blue Mosque and other attractions. The tram stations and the ferryboat stations are closeby and a short walk away. The Hotel arranged for a pickup from the Airport at a cost of Euro25. The room we were given was a Suite, as shown on the hotels web site. As we were a family of 4, they had converted the Sofa in the Living room into a bed. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. The bathroom was clean and hot and cold water at good pressure was available. Adequate clean towels were provided in the room. The wash-basin in our bath room didn't have a stopper, however the same was provided by the reception desk when I brought it to their notice.The rooms were cleaned daily. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. They tried to meet the guests request and were ready with advice and tips. The breakfast in the room in the basement was plentiful & nice and set you up for the day. Room service is not available. However, when we wanted hot water etc we were directed towards the cafeteria/bar in the Hotel. There are plenty of restaurants in the vicinity. Wifi connectivity and a computer was available in the lounge area which could be used by guests for free. The security in the Hotel was good and secuirty cameras were covering all areas on all floors. Regarding negatives, the Hotel does get some noise from the Trams and vehicles passing on the road. It didnt affect us but could be an issue with light sleepers. One wished that the Hotel will provide electric kettles in the room so that guests could help themselves to tea/coffee.

The thing you can't beat in this hotel is its great location. Most of the sights such as Topkapi palace, Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Spice Bazaar and Galata bridge are just about 5-10 minutes walk away. The Grand Bazaar is about 15 minutes by walk. Moreover, the hotel is located in a busy street with the main Istanbul tram line. Therefore there is plenty of traffic, lots of shops and restaurants nearby and general activity even late into the night. About the hotel, other travellers have written about the good ambience, friendly staff and delicious breakfast spread. I agree with all these things. The room and the bathroom were clean and tidy and the towels and linen were changed daily. There was an airconditioner, TV and hair dryer. The only negative point about the room was its very small size. I had booked a single room and there was just enough space for a dresser, a bed and a small wardrobe. The bathroom too was very small. Of course, this mattered little to me because all I needed was a space to sleep in the night. Internet and wireless access were available in the lounge. I would have liked it better if it were available in the rooms too. The hotel staff are quite friendly - they respond to emails.

For strarters it was painted an ugly lime green, it looked onto a construction site and the bedding was awful. There was a dirty bed cover on the bed and a tiny sheet underneath it which my husband and I fought over for the five nights we were there. The carpets, curtains and the bed cover were badly in need of replacing and the bathtub was pretty old with paint chipped away. The breakfast was decent with hot and cold food and fruit available but after 5 days of EXACTLY the same things you tire. The location was good and it was easy to get to the major sites as well as the Eminou and Kabatas for the ferries. This is definately a budget hotel and maybe we were wrong in expecting any more.

Near to mini supermarkets BIM and DIA. And near to cheap eating places. My recommendation is Urfalim just a few hundred meters down the road. It is a small friendly hotel. part of the lobby is shared with a soap shop and a barber shop. It is amazing that they can squeeze quite a number of rooms into a seemingly small place. It is adequate as a 3 star hotel. My room was clean, has a tiny TV and have ample wardrobe space. Found a friendly and helpful hotel staff called Muharrem who gives good recommendation on food places. Breakfast was adequate. More or less the same food everyday but you cant expect too much for a hotel this size and price. My main complains are the noisy toilets, and its proximity to the main street where you can hear the trams and traffic. While I was there, the hotel was having some minor renovations. Expect a bit of noise if you want to sleep in during the afternoon. But there is so much to see, explore and eat in Istanbul, you shouldnt be in the hotel at day time.
