I thought the bed was extremely hard and the pillows very soft, and I didn't sleep too well the first night. The second night, a Friday, I slept fine but everyone else at the conference complained about the street noise, apparently there was a disco that the hotel claimed was a one-off event, but others said the noise came from the bar on the corner.

You can only take the elevator up to the 3rd floor, then you have to go up stairs to get to the rooms. When you open the door to the room you are in an entryway with 4 doors. The door to the left is the larger room which contains 3 twin beds. The door to the right is a slightly smaller room containing 2 twin beds pushed together. Both rooms had a desk and chair and also several other chairs to sit in. The larger room had a short sofa too. The furniture looked like it was from Ikea. Both rooms had a 2 burner electric stove top, a sink, and a small refrigerator. There were also some utensils and dishes and a teakettle. Neither room was carpeted. The beds were adequately comfortable. The larger room had no view, the smaller room had a view over some apartments behind the hotel. The other 2 doors were to the toilet room and the shower room. The toilet room was really tiny and barely fit the toilet and a tiny sink. The shower room was larger and was the length of a fill size tub with a regular sink on the back wall. You could get a blow dryer from the front desk if you left a deposit. We paid 230 euro a night for 4 adults. This did not include breakfast, which could be purchased for 11.50 euro a person. We thought that was very expensive and didn't try it. The entire street in front of the hotel was torn up while we were there which was a nuisance. The trams are very close by. It's hard to find a hotel for 4 adults in Europe within our budget, so this place worked for us.

We sat in a cafe with free wi-fi internet searching and searching for somewhere to accomodate 5 people within' our price range for the one evening. By fluke, we stumbled upon Le Coin - Residence which miraculously had a 5 person room available for a decent price. The place itself is generally not advertised as a hotel, as we found out that it normally acts as student housing throughout the year. We were SO happy to have somewhere to stay after hours of lugging around our luggage, that this place seemed like a godsend! Pro's - Good location --- within' walking distance to the main square, shopping, restaurants, etc - Reasonable price - Large room size --- For 5 of us, we ended up having the whole top floor, which consisted of 2 bed rooms (1 room 2 beds, 1 room 3 single beds) and each room had a small kitchenette, a desk, a small tv, and a sofa and chairs. The two rooms were separate quarters .. with a shared bathroom in between. MORE than sufficient for our needs. Sure, the rooms arent decorated, and have no amentities you'd find in a real hotel, but you have the necessities. Cons - A little outdated. - Rooms were freezing at night (because we werent aware we had to turn the HEAT ON when entering) - The elevator doesn't make it to the top floor, so you have to go up 2 flights of narrow stairs (with LUGGAGE!!!) to get to it. - Only one person working at the time we were there, so we had to go down ourselves if we needed anything. For the price, and the rut we were in, we couldn't have asked for more. I prefer a hotel style accomodation generally, but if you're not picky, and you want a good location + a good price and are OK with it being completely basic.. .then I would definately recommend this place.

The reception area is decent with air conditioning and the staff are quite friendly. The rooms are quite large by European standard and small \"Kitchen\" is pretty useful as highlighted by other comments. Unfortunately, these are about all I can say anything nice about this hotel.

There are a few windows in the rooms but not all of them can be opened. We thought things might get better at night but how wrong we are. The heat were there all through the night and I have to sleep with a wet tower! My wife and a few younger ones preferred to stay at the reception area for the air conditioning until late night! None in our family got any sleep and the situation was even worse at about 5 in the morning when the shops/bars/restaurants opposite to the hotel started to open/clean up their places. The noices are loud and irritating. At that point I've decided to move out of this hotel immediately even we might have to forfeit the payments for the remaining nights! Thankfully, maybe we are not the first guests to make such a complaint, the staff promptly agreed to our request without charging anything. We moved into the Marriott hotel immediately and what a night and day difference!

All of the contact I had with the hotel before was very prompt and helpful. The directions they gave for the tram were exact. go to the east side of the station where tram 4, 9, 16, 24 or 25 are leaving from. The stop close to our hotel is called the 'Munt Plein' (= 3rd stop). When you look around you will see a big building with a Heineken sign on the roof, which is Hotel De L'Europe. We are located (Nieuwe Doelenstraat 5) slightly opposite to the entrance to this hotel. Check in was very quick and they remembered me from my emails. Ok I sent a couple with questions. They give you your keys and the folder even has the weather report for the week, which they also post on a whiteboard by the front desk. I borrowed a hair dryer and left my 12E deposit. Later when I discovered this one didn't work well, they quickly exchanged it for me. Our room was not fancy, but clean and roomy. I hadn't expected a balcony so I was very excited. Our room actually had a door at the entrance, then a very short hallway with the door to the bathroom then another door. So with the double doors I only once heard the other guests--people next door and only because we had an adjoining door in the room as well. We loved the man who cleaned the rooms who was very nice. Even when we left our room very late, it was no problem for him to clean our room when we asked if it was still ok at the front desk. We also left a big tip because it was so late. The bathroom was very clean, and I'm pretty picky. The noise from the street... ok so since we were facing the Muntplein you could definitely hear street noise. However, the windows are double paned so it was never loud, more like an ambient noise that was very easy to ignore. I remember thinking once walking down quieter canal when a loud car went by that the single loud noise on a quiet street would be much more distracting. We aren't light sleepers, but the noise never woke us and we didn't even have any trouble on New Year's when the streets were packed until morning. The staff was extremely helpful, directing us to the pharmacy (for cold medicine) and wherever else we asked about and even brought me a vase for my tulips. They were also not nosy or invasive and we felt all alone in our nice little room, large smoking btw. They have a safe that sits by the front desk where you get a drawer with your own key and then the hotel staff has the other key and has to open the main door of the safe to give you access. Very safe and 24 hour access since there was almost always someone there when we went by. Also, at night very occasionally the desk was empty in which case you can get in the outside security door from the street using your key, so the hotel never had wandering strangers. The heat worked very well and the heated floors are nice. The elevator worked great although if it's an issue for you, there were little 3-step flights of stairs in front of our room. I don't think the room had air conditioning, but I could be wrong about that. The area is very safe and there were lots of restaurants close, Rembrantplein, major shopping streets and a tram stop with most of the lines (just across the street) were less than 5 minutes.

One of which was quite nice with a wonderful view and bay window opening up onto the street. It was a little noisy at night, but we were there for the culture and nightlife, so not a problem. One of the other rooms was decent enough. Nothing special in any way, but clean and quiet. The third room felt quite dingy to me and depressing. The furniture is that plastic stuff you might see at IKEA, but that's okay. You're in Amsterdam, so we want it to feel different. The dingy room had a run-down Motel 6 feel to it. Again, that is just my opinion. And all the rooms were the same price! The price of the room was one of the highest of all of our hotel rooms in our 22 night trip, but Amsterdam is more expensive in general, so that is not a negative toward the establishment. Another huge positive is the staff. Reception and housecleaning -- everyone was exceptionally helpful and friendly. In short, I MIGHT return to this hotel. I would look around first, however.

So we booked another hotel for the one night (Sofitel Grand up the street, to try something fancy), planning to come back. The week before we showed up I was informed by email that my room was available for the missing night - but it was too late, I had a nonrefundable room at the Grand. And boy was it a pain to switch hotels for a night. Anyhoo, the hotel is directly opposite the Hotel de L'Europe, on a narrow street, so with a cab hop out fast and yank your bags in quick or you'll get run over by a bike or block potential traffic. Centrally located indeed, but if you're not a big \"city person\" you will find that \"walking distance\" involves serious dedicated trekking time (20+ min to get to places like Anne Frank House or the Pancake House). Wear proper walking shoes with good support and only carry what you need to. Or, rent bikes. There was a breakfast but it was for a fee so we opted for dining in the city. You can get wifi in-room, and it's VERY cheap - buy a week for 10 EU. However, the room will only recognize ONE computer per access code you are given; they were nice enough to give us two for the price of one, since there were two of us with laptops, but I don't know if they were supposed to or not. Large double bed room - everything's bigger in the US, meaning, a double bed is really a twin bed to us. Bedside tables were on wheels, so we could easily maneuver them around. Mini kitchen with stove kettle, big stainless steel sink, dishware, silverware, dining table and two chairs. Kitchen cabinet has built in fridge, and the cabinet handle to open it was missing. If you dirty your dishes, housekeeper won't wash them. Big armoire, little tv with actually a good number of random european channels. A sort of \"warm modern\" look to the room, not too cold and austere, high ceilings. I asked for a quiet room off the main street so our room was large, faced the rear street, where things were peaceful. We were so far away from the majority of the rooms that we never heard much street or guest noise. No in room safe, didn't bother to use desk safe. Nearly floor to ceiling double windows with some curtains that have seen better days, but the feeling is very european and bright. Beds not too firm, actually starting to feel a bit saggy and they're twins so if you sleep wildly, careful not to fall out. Two big armchairs in front of the tv, good for reading or dozing. Front desk is very small and doesn't look particularly secure; several times in our trekking around it was unattended. The staff person often ends up doing more than one job at a time, leaving the desk to attend to things, or will take a break in the breakfast area, which has a separate dining area and a sitting area with a television, a nice big table in a streetside window, and some couches/chairs. The breakfast area looked very snazzy, not upscale just very stylish and nice. So, when we first checked in and had to leave our luggage for a bit, it didn't go anywhere - it sat in the front room, no tags, and we saw this happen to other people's luggage. Anyone from another room or off the street can just grab your bag and go. There IS a sort of security system - two doors, the inner door requiring a key, but it is often left open for convenience. Which is fine, just don't leave unprotected luggage right inside! If you have bikes, there's a ramp down into the basement where you can store them. There IS free laundry - one washer, one dryer. You'll have to be vigilant to get in there when someone else isn't using them, to get your clothes done. They're also eco-friendly, meaning a wash will take an hour or more and a dry will take at least a few hours. You buy soap tablets from the front desk. The machines are labelled in images and Dutch so you may need to ask for help. :) The stairs made me think of an unprotected, rickety jungle gym. The suspension poles literally bend and wiggle away if you bump them. Made of wood, the stairs themselves are sturdy but narrow and short - and curving. The stair system is a narrow spiral, so if you're disabled, elderly, or carrying things, be careful or take the elevator. Bathroom narrow, but clean and bigger than expected. No real counter space, so get creative. They do provide the installed free shower soap/shampoo dispenser. Shower curtain rod didn't wrap all the way around so you need to be very careful where you aim your water or it will spray the bathroom/toilet. Since it's a small hotel with a small staff you aren't going to get a lot of amenities but they do have a cute little \"service book\" in the rooms and if you demand help, you get it. We therefore asked for help to carry our bags to our rooms, because if you are not near the elevator and have any suitcase over \"small\" you'll have to lug it up several bursts of steps to get to your room (we were all the way at the end of a hall and had three short sets of steps). Sometimes for such help you'll have to wait a bit. In leaving to switch hotels at one point we needed didn't want to carry our laptops but didn't want them left with our other luggage, so they placed them in the manager's office. This office is not closed, however. We weren't there during a terribly busy time and staff was around front, but again, if you're vigilant this might worry you. So, definitely great for the price, we were hunting thoroughly for a place that would give us a clean, spacious room with value for our money, and this provided it. Comes with a couple idiosyncrasies, but compare that to a dirty/older/cramped/more expensive hotel and this will of course come out on top.", "Date": "July 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anaheim, California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Place To Stay but a Little Noisy\u201d", "Author": "mbonfils", "ReviewID": "UR7796334", "Content": "I really enjoyed my visit at Le Coin.

Despite assurances that there would be lots for the kids to enjoy we were a little apprehensive about the city. However we had a brilliant time. Hotel Residence Le Coin was a great base with lovely clean but basic apartments. We had a family apartment which consisted of two rooms (one with two single beds and the other larger had 3 single beds) which were separated by a modern bathroom (with lots of towels, soap and shower cream) and adjoining toilet. Both rooms had TV, fridge and seating area so everyone was happy. The whole apartment was self contained behind a 'front door'. Maid service changed towels, cleaned bathroom and made beds each day. The reception was open 24 hours and the staff were very friendly - giving directions, information on which tram to take, which stop to get off at etc - very useful in a strange city. Check in / check out was very quick and efficient and safety deposit boxes were available at no extra cost. On arrival we walked from Central Station to the hotel - which took about 20 minutes - along the Damrak and then along the Rokin - a very picturesque stroll even with luggage. It took us another 10 minutes to locate the hotel. We were given directions that it was opposite the Hotel L'Europe which is a very large hotel. The Le Coin is actually opposite the front entrance of the Hotel L'Europe which is just down a little side street off the Rokin. The kids really enjoyed the Anne Frank House, the Van Gogh Museum, Rembrant's House and especially Madame Tussauds. A canal trip is also a must to experience some of the hightlights not accessible by foot and to see the extent of the canals running through the city. The flower market and main shopping street were just across the street from the hotel and also proved popular with the children. There are various restaurants in the vicinity along with croissanteries and little grocery shops selliing pastries, sandwiches and filled rolls - if this doesn't appeal to the kids - there's a McDonalds just over the canal opposite the hotel and a Burger King around the corner! Just one word of warning - the bicycles - they are everywhere - just make sure you keep out of the bike lanes and beware when stepping onto them when crossing the road. The trams also creep up on you really quickly and you hardly hear them until they are right behind you!

We were happy with our stay and would stay there again in the future. Location: The hotel location is quite central being near the Muntplein. We found we were no more than a 30 minute walk from any location. The Kalverstraat (the main shopping street) is about a two minute walk away. Rembranthuis is approx 5 minutes away. Anne Frank House is about 20 minutes away and the Van Gogh/Rijksmuseum is approx 25-30 minutes away depending on which way you go. Centraal Station is about a 30 minutes walk away however you can take a tram 3 stops to Muntplein and get off there. There are numerous groceries store within a 5-10 minute walk if you want to take advantage of the small kitchenette for yourself. The hotel is almost directly across from the Hotel de L'Europe. Front Desk The staff was friendly and provided us good instructions to places that we were trying to get to. Our check in/check out was fast and efficient. The Room The room is relatively basic. We had a small tv with a chair and a small coffee table. The double bed was comfortable and we didn't find any plastic on the bed as mentioned in an previous review. The sheets were not changed on a daily basis but would be on request. We had a small table with two chairs to have our meals at. The armoire was huge and held a fair amount of clothing and purchases. The kitchen was pretty basic with a two-burner hot plate, a fridge, a coffee maker, and sink. They provided a couple of kettles for tea, there was plates, bowls, cutlery, 3 pans and a couple of pots for us to use. Unfortunately there was nothing to clear up the dishes with and there were no tea towels. Credit to the cleaning staff though, they did up the dishes the next day for us so they were clean when we came back to the room. The bathroom was very clean and immaculate. We were provided with shower caps and bar soap but there was shower soap and shampoo in a dispensor at the end of the tub for use. The water pressure was good, the only problem we had was the ability to maintain the same water temperature as it would fluctuate. A down side to the room was the street noise, even with the windows closed. We could here the street noise from the small street below us and the bells from Muntplein. The noise was much worse when we had to open the window in the evening in order to cool the room down a little or it got stuffy. They did have a fan in the room but it did not look like it had been dusted in a while. I have to admit that we didn't get too many nights of good sleep due to the amount of noise. Overall We would stay here again. We saved a bundle of money by going to the market and buying food instead of eating out. We figured that our meal costs were about 3 euros a piece for each meal by doing this. We paid a 100 euros a night, a discount from the regular 130 euros per night and this alone makes this a hotel to stay at.", "Date": "May 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel in very good location\u201d", "Author": "TMitch6542", "ReviewID": "UR5018845", "Content": "I just got back from staying at the Le Coin for five nights. I think this is a good, budget hotel. It was clean and basically comfortable. I would not call it charming or romantic. We stayed in a Large Twin room which was quite spacious, but I don't think the rooms have any real character in style or decoration. We paid 145 Euro's a night for the room, just so you can get a comparison to other hotels. There were few amenities in the room. Soap and shower caps were given, but no shampoo, lotion or other toiletries that you usually find in hotels. No hairdryers either.No safes in the room, but there is one in the common area that you can arrange to use. My major complaint is that they use some sort of plastic on their mattresses that made sleeping quite hot at night for us. That being said, it is in a very good location and the staff is quite nice and helpful. There are free laundry facilities for guests in the basement which come in handy. I did not have breakfast at the hotel as I took advice from another review and went to the cafe on the corner each morning for very good coffee. An italian restaurant called Vasso was recommended to us and we really enjoyed our dinner there and it was very close by. Did I love this hotel? No. Did I hate it? No. Would I return?

This time around I was looking for a hotel in Amsterdam that suited 14 girls (28-34 yrs) on a hen weekend - without the tacky group shenannigans. I booked the Le Coin based on a recommendation from some guys who stayed at New Year - all boys, so it could feasibly have been shabbier than they described...knowing how boys \"compromise\" on comfort in favour of beer, value and whatever else they get up to. Saw the pics and bit the bullet - and was absolutely delighted. The Le Coin is very central, a ten minute walk from Amsterdam Centraal train station (down the Damrak and Rokin)and 5 mins from the Rembrandtsplein where you'll find tons of bars and restaurants. Our rooms varied from a corner room with fab views of the canal and clock tower, to split level loft-style apts with a ladder up to the beds (careful when tipsy - not for the clumsy). The amenities are geared to a short-term stay, the wee kitchenette was a bonus and the place felt like a self-contained studio rather than a hotel room. Great things include: staff (cheery and helpful), underfloor heating (wooden floorboards, cosy), views and comfy, comfy beds (if a little narrow). Only real drawback for some was the ladders (no good for wide hips). Can't comment on the breakfast because we never made it down in time.... We had a great weekend (try Boom Chicago if you're into live comedy - show changes all the time and never fails to amuse, topical and improvisation stuff) and most of the group have discussed returning in May for another stay, probably for five days now we know we could do so in comfort and style.

Only thing, bring your own pillows and foam for the mattress (although they did have foam, I saw it in the laundry room). I sleep on memory foam every night so I am not used to a regular mattress and if you are like me bring foam. The trams ran right outside and there was a grocery store right around the corner, plus many inexpensive places to get dinner. There were even two coffee shops within two blocks of the hotel. We tried the breakfast downstairs once and it was well worth the 9 euros. We could have cooked, there was a stovetop and sink and fridge, but we were on vacation! We were even able to do laundry for free in the basement, allowing us to pack lightly for the week. I did not smell cigarette smoke or anything else for that matter. There were not any mice or any bugs of any kind (and I am a bug magnet, if there is a bug within a mile it WILL crawl on me). There was even a hallway between our bedroom door and the door to the rest of the hotel and that had the bathroom. So, if you go with a friend, they can shower and get changed in private (see photos). We liked it so much we booked a two week stay in may for the same room just before we left.
