The staff are very friendly and and a nice touch was the request to a queue at reception to \"wait for the next smile\". Our rooms were described as \"small single room\". One was on the 34th and one the 35thfloor, and both had superb views over the city and the Tiergarten. They were not excessively small - about the size of the third bedroom in a 3 bed semi. The TV had 5 English channels, there was a safe, but no tea/coffee making facilities although these may have been available to borrow. The airconditioning and heating were easy to use. The bed was comfortable for sleeping, but the drawback was that it was impossible to sit up and read in bed for long, because there was no headboard and the bed was midway between two walls neither of which was suitable to be used as a headboard even if the bed was pushed up to it. Also the only light switch was by the door and flex of the reading lamp on the desk did not reach the bed, so one had to get out of bed to switch the light on or off. The hotel is very secure. Guests had to use their swipe cards to activate the lift before pressing the floor button, and some rooms - our inlcuded had an \"ante door\" that had to be swiped before reaching the room door. There are several restaurants in the hotel and prices vary. But there are many snack and light meal outlets in the adjacent shopping area including Burger King. There is a charge for WiFi, laptops can be rented, and bathrobes and slippers can be borrowed - not sure if there's a charge.

What a bizzarre comment. The number one advantage of this hotel is the location, right in the middle of Alexander Platz, there is an underground station within 50yards of the entrance/exit and The Overground within 100 yds. There are at least 5-6 taxis outside at any given time. The Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag, Spree Island, TV Tower, Berlin Dom,and other numerous other landmarks /museums/attractions are all within walking distance. The hotel is huge and extremely busy. It is a mix of business and tourist visitors whilslt we were there I think there was a different business conference every day and numerous coach tours of tourists. This can as we observed lead to a busy reception desk. However apart from the wait the reception staff were, courteous, professional and helpful. For people with a late departure there is a luggage room to store cases. The bar restaurant area downstairs is sophisticated with a resident piano player/singer who is very entertaining. Prices are on the top side of expensive here. The rooms themselves are on the small side but are pleasantly furnished. There is a desk, separate WC , shower and sink.Some find this a little disconcerting and their comments are well documented on here it was a none issue for me. There is a curtain to divide the sleeping area from the shower area for the ones who crave a little privacy. Beds are comfortable and linens of a decent quality, however only one pillow is a big drawback for me, towels a little on the small side. The big drawback to this hotel for me is noise. It is a building obviously cheaply built and as such noise travels very easily, people in adjoining rooms could be heard crystal clear even when not being particularly raucous and there was a constant noise from the centrally placed elevators. All in all this is a good city centre hotel for the visiting tourist or business person.

This hotel's location was incredibly convenient. It is literally right in the center of Alexanderplatz, which means plenty of shops, restaurants, and sights are right outside your door. The view of the Fernsehturm (Berlin's TV Tower) from my room was not to be believed, and I did not even pay extra for a higher room. The service of the hotel staff was great. There were a few minor problems with my room - the heater was stuck on high and at some point a fuse blew and the power outlets stopped working - but each time a staff member was sent up and fixed the problem with no delay. Everything was very clean. Check-in was a breeze, but check-out took a long time due to the line. I don't think there is much the hotel can do about this, they were all working very quickly and just got rushed by a group of people I suppose. The food I ate at the hotel restaurant on the first floor was quite good, if a bit expensive for Berlin. The only downside to the Park Inn is the rather peculiar layout of its rooms. The double bed in mine was just two single mattresses pushed together, which wasn't the most comfortable arrangement. The desk area near my window was pretty cramped. The most interesting aspect of the room by far was the bathroom setup. There is no separation between the bathing area and the sleeping area. The toilet was in a small closet by itself right by the door, and the sink was right next to my bed. A glass-walled shower stall stood in between, so you can see right in to the shower from anywhere in the room.

The first room ( we had to change) was modern and nice. The TV was annoying though and had a mind of it's own. The 'bathroom' is effectively a shower/toilet and a sink area within the room that you can conceal with a curtain the door to the toilet is also the door to the shower. I didn't like this, it was not trendy if thats why they thought and essentially pretty annoying. I think the only reason they did it wa s otherwise there is simply not enough room. The bed was comfy. The first night, after a night out the two rooms either side decided to make a load of noise. We can handle this but when we ourselves got in at 4am and they were still screaming at 6 am(!) and running from room to room banging their doors we had stern words with them twice before calling security to shut them up. This wasn't helped by the gap between the door and floor that lets sound in. Anyway later that day we asked to be moved. The receptionist said sorry and we were moved. The next room was on floor 30 with a better view. The room was older and the silly attempt at a bathroom had no curtain this time. The bed was old and the mattress had collapsed on one side.

If you are in a couple it should be fine but the format is one of those space saver designs where you pull a curtain round the shower area. The toilet door was also semi transparent!

Great location, right on Alexanderplatz with access to both 'S' and 'U' bahn stations, tram and bus. We arrived quite late but there were 4 members of staff at reception who welcommed us and dealt with us quickly. We had a city view room on the 20th floor (well worth any extra payment) with the famous TV tower right across from us and a wonderful view over the city. The room was clean but seemed only to be vacuumed once during our 4 day stay. It had no wifi but had a cabled connection, I asked about free Wifi (as I have a Carlson Gold Elite card which gives free Wifi at Radisson Blu hotels) but even though it is 'Park Inn by Radisson' you don't get free Wifi. Wifi is \u20ac6 an hour or \u20ac18 a day!! Top tip, walk the 200m to the base of the TV tower and get 2 hours free Wifi in Starbucks for the price of a great coffee! There was no kettle or coffee stuff in the room but we asked at reception and it was sent up to our room. It was supplied with one days worth of coffee/tea but more was available from the maid. The hotel didn't mind us keeping fresh milk in the minibar fridge. The double bed was a good size but 'firm' and a little odd as it had 2 single duvets which took a bit of getting used to. Breakfast was included in our deal, it was well laid out with all the usual cereals, cold meats, cheeses, fruit etc plus a separate section for hot food. Excellent choice and quality but was \u20ac17 if not included in your room rate. You really enter the hotel by the side door as this is the one onto Alexanderplatz. Lots of kids skateboarding around there in the evening, didn't cause any problems but the sidewalk (pavement) could do with a steam clean. Other than breakfast, we ate out in Berlin so I can't comment on the restaurant. There is a great Italian place across the road, \"Pizza Romantica\" which gets busy. Really nice folk run it and took the trouble to made a vegetarian dish specially for my wife. Across from the holel is the Kaufhof Galeria department store. Great place to shop and fabulous self service restaurant on the top floor. If you are a veggie, head here but be warned, when you pile your plate up from the salad bar, it's weighed at the till! The Park Inn is a great location for 'Museum Island' and there are several 'biggies' there. These are within walking distance but equally you can take the tram for just one stop and walk the rest. I will certainly stay here again on my next visit to Berlin. Don't forget the Berlin Museum Pass' for \u20ac19 or 3 days free admission which is available from the Concierge at the hotel BUT remember to ask for the booklet that goes with it as that tells you which museums accept the pass. Don't forget to visit the DDR Museum just next to museum island, by the cathedral. A small but excellent 'hands -on' museum for all the family but sadly not covered by the pass.

We stayed at the Park Inn hotel on Alexander Platz. The location was good, as most of the main attractions were just a 10-20 minutes train or tube ride away. The square that the hotel is situated on is also very good with market stalls and shops around it. The hotel itself was too big and busy for my liking. When we checked in, we were offered an upgrade to a room higher up the building which offered better views of the city. My partner decided to go for the upgrade at 15 Euros extra per night.We were on the 34th floor. The views were great. The room itself was a decent size; however, they had this weird thing whereby the toilet and shower were effectively IN the hotel room! The sink was actually in the room (that made it look a bit like a student halls of residence room). The shower was behind frosted glass, with diagonal peek-a-boo slants at the top. When you are in the shower, your partner or whoever you are sharing with can see you showering! It's the same for the toilet, they can see you in the toilet, and there was only one door which doubled up as the shower door AND toilet door. So, if one person is in the shower, the other person can't really use the toilet, as there would be no door there. This provided no privacy and did take a lot of getting used to. To be honest, I hated the exhibitionism of it all. I love my body, but I love my privacy more! Another annoying thing is that the chambermaid always came by around 8.15am to knock on our door to clean the room. So, she woke us up every morning with her knocking on the door. She even knocked on our door at 8.30am on the morning that we were checking out. She should have been informed by reception staff that we were checking out at 12pm that day, therefore she should not have gone to clean our room until after we had checked out. The hotel reception staff were always nice and friendly and they all spoke English, so it was easy to communicate with them. There was a spa, but you had to pay to use it. We felt that it should have been included in the price, so we never used it. The hotel bar was very nice with mellow mood lighting and a good piano player/singer.

The rooms are tight efficiencies with no real wall dividing bath area from bed space, but my room overlooked the TV tower and street life so the view compensated. In a way, Park Inn is a window to the new Berlin and at night the huge plaza teems with buskers, cafes, and youngsters out on the town. There is a \"Spago\" restaurant in the lobby that serves a good pizza, with some live night time music. A crowded concierge desk that runs independent of the hotel, selling tours and other services -- they were polite and helpful but usually overwhelmed. This place has 1,000 rooms or so, and the lobby is a bee hive. Even the doors on to Alexanderplatz often require that you give way to tourist mobs. Luckily, the elevators only permit guests with room cards. My guess is that conventioneers like it for the anonymity and bustle. All of this would have been OK (for this older reviewer) were it not for the final sting.

It was essentially called the Berlin Mitte Hotel, later to become the Forum, the Park Inn and somewhere in the last year (I was last there in September 2010) Park Inn by Radisson. Now there are basically three centers in Berlin. First, there\u2019s Alexanderplatz, the heart of the former east-Berlin, next to which most attractions are located. The Park Inn is right there, close by foot to just about everywhere. Second, there\u2019s the area between Potsdamer Platz and the Brandenburg Gate, the later a 20 \u2013 30 minute walk from Alexanderplatz\u2026 Finally, there\u2019s the Kudamm area of west-Berlin, the area for shopaholics\u2026 From Alexanderplatz all is near, either on foot or by public communication. Bus TXL goes to Tegel Airport. Bus 100 takes you to almost all attractions, near and far. Bus 200 takes you to Potsdamer Platz. And then there are U-Bahns to take you to other, further places. The standard rooms are not big, but certainly not tiny. They are much larger than, say, hotels in central Paris. This is probably because the hotel was built in the GDR era. All standard rooms have TVs, bathtubs, a safe, a hair dryer and a mini-bar. As for TV channels, there are plenty in German, 3 English news channels (Sky, CNBC, France 24), 3 French channels (TV5, Arte, France 24), 2 in Italian (RAI 1+3) and 1 in Spanish (TVE), Polish (TVP Polonia) and Russian (Russia1). The main change since Park Inn became Park Inn by Radisson is the possibility to get a room with a view to the TV Tower. In all my previous visits (and there have been quite a few), it was enough to request it. Now, unless you have paid for it in advance, you can only get it by paying an extra fee upon arrival \u2013 in my case, they asked for 50 extra Euros daily. I humbly decided to stay with the standard room and the view towards the eastern-town. The rooms are THE SAME anyway. At any case, if worse comes to worse, change to channel 29 on your TV set, and you\u2019ll have a live view of the TV Tower\u2026 The breakfast is superb! I won\u2019t go into details as it would be too long. There is, believe me, plenty to eat. You won\u2019t feel hungry until the late afternoon hours, or until you crave the famous Berlin Currywurst (the best way for it, BTW, is halfway between the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag, in my opinion). Remember that you can also ask for tea and coffee making facilities brought up to your room for free. There has been much discussion over the bathtub not being separated from the room. As I don\u2019t believe most people go into interior d\u00e9cor while booking a hotel, I\u2019ll skip it. There is a curtain (as you can see in my attached photo) and really it has never disturbed me. Internet is a bit of a problem. There are three computers in the lobby (remember it\u2019s a huge hotel with over 900 rooms\u2026) and Wi-Fi in the room. All options cost money. To sum up, a lovely hotel, excellent location, great breakfast and a friendly staff. I have stayed here many times and will keep coming here.

It was our disorganisation that brought us here. When we saw the room, we were at a loss for words, for just a moment. To round up the room, it was about 20m2, ok interior design, good view... but the shower, toilet and basin were IN the room. You slept literally under a meter from the basin, woke up to this view. The shower and toilet were simply glassed in, with half frost, so that the other occupant could just have a wee peak while you do number two. The shower and toilet had a shared door so that you can only use either the toilet or shower at the same time. It was appalling for the price.

Overall, I would consider it just above average, but the value for money, the location, and the views from the upper floors makes it worth a stay. My major complaint would be the noise from what seemed to be the hotel\u2019s ventilation system. It made a very annoying and rather loud tone that sounded similar to a vacuum cleaner running in the distance. The tone would be heard for approximately 15 seconds, then stop for 5, and then start again. This was continuous for the whole stay. The noise could be heard throughout the building. I had to use earplugs to sleep as once I focused on the noise it was impossible to sleep. We had few minor problems with the room: The room was quite dusty. I don\u2019t think it had been used in a while, as there was a soft layer of dust over everything. Other than that, it was very clean. The satellite/cable signal on the television kept cutting out. I don\u2019t go on a trip to watch television, but trying to watch the morning news can be a little annoying when the TV keeps going on and off. There were only two English language channels, one of which was France24. There was no heating. There was a temperature control dial on the wall, but it was not functional. The room was very cold at night, but the bedding was very warm which made sleeping comfortable. The cold room was very noticeable when stepping out of the shower into the cool air. The \u2018bathroom\u2019 is within the bedroom area of the hotel room. There are no walls separating the \u2018bathroom\u2019 from the room itself. For privacy, there is long shower curtain that can be pulled across the width of the hotel room to separate the bathroom area from the bed. The toilet is located in it\u2019s own small cubical. Despite the minor problems with the room and the bizarre noise, there were many good aspects to the hotel: This hotel is in an excellent location - great links to public transport, within walking distance of many sights, and many restaurants and bars nearby.

It's right across the street from the metro station and there are tons of shops, restaurants, malls and grocery stores nearby. Overall the hotel was nice, nothing special and definitely not worth the money. When we arrived there was a huge line up of about 20 odd people in front of us with about 4 staff working to check everyone in. It wasn't too long of a wait, maybe 15 minutes. The hotel is HUGE and therefore almost everytime we went through the lobby there was always a line up of people either checking in or out. It was a very crowded hotel that's for sure. The room was nothing special, European standards, small and compact but clean. The only complaint I have about the room is that the maids never once changed over our sheets in our 5 nights there. The towels were replaced daily and the room cleaned. There is a safe and a mini fridge.There are NO english chanels besides France 24 news, so get used to watching a lot of news. There are movies available on demand, at a price of course, like everything in this hotel. The price of wifi is CRAZY. It is not available in your room either, so you have to go down to the rather crowded lobby to use it. We bought a 45 minute card which gave us access to their computers and that cost us 10 euros. The bathroom downstairs regardless of what the staff say DOES charge you regardless if you are a guest. Nowhere on that sign does it say that guests do not have to pay. Now mind you, I went in once without change and never paid and the lady sitting outside never said anything to me but they look at you and watch you expectantly waiting for that 50 cents. This is the case in most public areas in Berlin. In the mall, at tourist locations, in the restaurants, they all sit outside the door with a sign with the price and a plate for you to pay...so have change on hand. It's never been more than 50 cents anywhere we went. We never had the breakfast the hotel offered as it was 19 euros, per person, per day which is insane, instead we bought some bread, fruit and cheese from a nearby grocery store which cost us about 15 euros and lasted us the whole 5 days. There is another restaurant in the hotel towards the back and a Burger King directly attached as well so you won't go hungry thats for sure. The staff at the front desk are not overly happy in my opinion. There was one point on the day we checked out that we had a bit of an emergency with the shuttle service and my husband asked the lady at the front if we could use the phone to call the company, she said no problem, showed him the phone and how to dial, he tried a few times but it was busy, so I went back a few minutes later to try again and after I got off the phone the lady behind the desk literally snatched it away from me and gave me the WORST look. She asked if I were a guest, I said I had just checked out and then she was SO rude in telling me that I had to PAY to use the phone, for the whole 2 minutes I was on it, after the other staff member showing my husband how to use it and saying it was fine. It was very embarressing how she reacted towards me and I had to pay the 85 cents!! I thought this was absurd, I just spent over $600 euros to stay at your hotel for 5 nights and you are making me pay your 85 cents? Her reaction and how rude she was to me was enough to make me never want to stay here again. Overall the hotel was clean and nice but way to expensive for what they offer.

Bed could have been bigger but was v. confortable (firm) and the windows opened so there was no need to depend on air con - always a bonus. We didn't breakfast in the hotel, choosing instead to explore - we found the department store just over the square - the Galleria - had a great buffet restaurant on the top floor with amazing views and great food - Sekt for 1 euro a glass too if you really want to push the boat out. We signed up for a late check out (25 euro for 6pm departure, nice option) Aside from some hiccups when our key got cancelled prior to our departure and a bit of a wait getting our left luggage back we really enjoyed staying in this hotel. Another small gripe is that there is no wifi in rooms and English speaking tv is severely limited; News, yawn. That aside, staff were lovely, Aplatz is a great location and we'd stay here again.

I can't think of a less practicle bathroom. Obviously I complained and was offered a different room with a self contained bathroom. This self contained bathroom had glass walls! Clear glass walls!

We picked this hotel because it offered views of the TV tower and it was located in the city center. When we arrived we were given a room on a high floor and just as we were admiring our TV tower view some fella fell past our window!!! We quickly noticed the cables and read the sign on the window telling us the hotel offering a free fall experience. Its extremely hard to relax when someone is flying past your window screaming \"WHHHHOOOOOOO\"!! As well as that the cables create a considerable amount of irritating noise from swooshing in the wind. This goes on all day, and they start testing the equipment early in the morning which makes a lot of noise too. If you do intend to stay make sure you ask for a room away from this. The rooms are very cramped and in order to get more space the shower and sink are all in the bathroom which just a curtain for privacy, it didn't bother us but if you were staying with friends it would be quite uncomfortable. The TV is small and old so the sound quality is quite poor. You can get bathrobes and slippers (something I love) by ringing housekeeping and the beds are quite comfortable. The breakfast offers a lot of choice but it is quite bland and a bit expensive considering it was cooked about 2 hours ago. The restaurant in the lobby is ok, nothing special, overpriced again but I suppose all hotels are. The room service was a real disappointment! We rang and asked for room service and this is the conversation went: \"Sorry room service stops at 10. Oh ok and what time is it now? Ahh its 1 minute past 10\" They refused to serve us despite the time and the fact that it doesn't tell you anywhere what time room service finishes, so we had to get dressed an leave in search of a restaurant which are not plentiful in Alexanderplatz. The hotel is located in the city center but all the best restaurants, tourist attractions, bars clubs etc are located elsewhere so maybe this wasn't such a good choice. Decide what you want to do and pick your hotel and area accordingly. We decided to rent bikes underneath the TV tower and spent all our time in other parts of the city.

The reception staff were in the main helpful, but don't expect any help regarding unworkable TV's etc. The concierge was very helpful and knowledgeable. The ground floor lobby of the hotel had a front and rear entrance/exit that was accessible by all and sundry. Beggars wandered into the lobby at regular intervals from the rear exit that leads onto a rather noisy square. There was a Burger King Restaurant in the lobby at the rear and a 50p charge for hotel guests using the lobby toilet !! Dining was good and access to East and West Berlin very easy by # 100 or 200 bus and the metro or tram. Berlin seemed to be rather a sad gray place and local people appeared quite serious.

The room also had a (too) small TV, safe (very inconvenient location, have to bend down on floor with high risk of hitting head when getting up). The whole lay-out of the room is done to fit as much as possible in a small space as possible and they have done a decent job. Some annoying things are the lack of water kettle,iron and ironing board (noted info that it was possible to have ironing board sent up to room on request but still prefer to have it in the room). The breakfast buffet was included in our rate and it was better than average. Good selection of hot and cold food. I did like the fact that it was possible to order an omelet.

We were brought to a double bed room on the top floor and the girl wanted to sell the room to me for the \"excellent\" view etc. but with a child in a double bed room where the child was suppose to sleep on a small couch was just not good enough.

The hotel is right in the city centre and as a Berliner myself (living for years abroad) it was great to see all the Christmas markets. Public transport (trains, busses, trams) are right outside the door so perfect for us. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as it was way overpriced. I think they wanted 15 Euro per person and although they had a buffet, the food they offered wasn't much different to what I usually get in a B&B. We went to the nearby bakeries and enjoyed our breakfasts there. The Hotel also has a great restaurant but again very overpriced. Rouladen for over 20 Euro gives the hotel a huge margin and the customer a feeling of being stupid to pay such a horrendous price. Mind you, the rouladen were delicious BUT the price does not justify it. These aren't lobsters! Because the Hotel is so central you find restaurants everywhere, good ones as well as bad ones but mainly good ones very reasonably priced - same with bars and coffee places.

We were all rather tired, but excited to be in Berlin for the first time. Check in was a breeze, the check in manager managed to get us two twin rooms on the 21st floor clse to each other with views over the city. The super-fast lifts impressed us all and the rooms themselves were amazing! The views over Berlin were phenomenal and the market in Alexanderplatz was in full-swing! As we freshened up we heard a noise outside the (open) windows. Shortly afterwards we saw what looked to be a harness being drawn up past the window. A few minutes later we saw someone flying past the window - one of the base flyers from the hotel roof! I was sorely tempted, but at nearly 100 euros I decided to leave it until another time. The hotel was spotlessly clean and the rooms were extremely comfortable. The 02 world where we were attending a concert, was easy to get to via the train. The transport links from Alexanderplatz are first class - S-Bahn, U-Bahn, bus, long distance/ICE train - take your pick! The breakfast was lovely in the chic restaraunt. Couldn't have faulted the service that we received, the reception manager booked a lunch table for us at the Hard Rock Cafe and provided detailed directions on how to get there, they also held our bags until later in the day when we were ready to collect them. We were all very sad to leave the hotel and the city, and I can safely say that I will definately return to both at the nearest possibility! I cannot comment on value for money, as the hotel was booked for us as part of a prize - but with such a high standard of accommodation and facilities I would be prepared to pay a lot of money to stay here!

S-Bahn ride directly from Schoeneberg Airport to Alexanderplatz, followed by a one minute walk across the square. It's also just a 20 sec. walk from the nearest U-Bahn and very convenient for the trams. It's just a 20 min. walk down Unter den Linden to reach the Brandenburg Gate, and for those wanting to see the old East Side, hop on a tram and go as far as you like into the poorer areas. German-speaking abilities come in very handy if you get lost around that side of Berlin. Perfect! I wrote directly to the hotel beforehand, to ask if we might have a room overlooking the \"west\" side of Berlin. We were given the best view possible, floor 34 and opposite the Fernsehturm. (TV Tower). I agree that the bathrooms are somewhat bizarre and you do have to be mighty good friends with your room companion, but they are spotlessly clean and the goosedown duvets and softest pillows provided me, a chronic insomniac, with better sleep than I've had for years. The windows are triple-glazed, vital in the temperatures we encountered, -15 degrees C. The only disappointment with the room was that there are no tea-making facilities provided. The hotel does seem a bit intent on squeezing extra money out of you; charging to use the loos in the foyer (so don't), Internet access and charging to use the roof terrace. However, this was out of bounds over Christmas, so we escaped any extras. The breakfast buffet is one of the most comprehensive we have had anywhere in the world and the restaurants serve top-quality food at reasonable prices. If you're on a budget, you can walk directly into a heated Mall where there's a good restaurant serving local cuisine. You can also access the Galeria department store from the hotel's second floor. We did wonder whether we might have chosen a hotel a bit far from the sights, but the integrated public transport system is so good, that most places can be reached in a very short time by either walking, tram, bus, U-Bahn or city train. Do buy a run-about pass. We weren't asked once to produce it, but there are hefty fines if you take the risk. The 5 day one was excellent value, and the purchase time is on it, so you can use it for 6 days. There were over 60 Christmas Markets and fairs whilst we were there, including one in Alexanderplatz itself, and several within easy walking distance. I recommend the Gendarmenmarkt for a wonderful Christmas Day lunch, beautifully decorated, and with warm, welcoming \"conservatory-style\" buildings, geared up for the purpose, and loads of stalls, quite unusual. (The Germans ar well geared up for winter and have quadrupled-banked snow ploughs at the airport and special ones for pavements, but for added safety, I recommend Bergsteiger boot chains.

However, wondering how bad this could be, we ended up fascinated to find out what could be so wrong with a basin located in the body of the room etc etc and so booked 3 nights. We are glad we did because the location of the hotel is fantastic for the old East: 3 minutes from Alexanderplatz U and S bahns and the trams and, if you are lucky, a fantastic view of the TV tower in all its socialist realist glory. Now this used to be an old communist hotel and so it seems that some years ago, the new hotel owners undertook a radical refurb to squeeze some more space out of the relatively long and thin rooms. So what they did was to find a way of doing away with the internal space that is normally a feature of a discrete bathroom by separating the shower, wc and handbasin and having them face outwards into the room.. Voila, you have an extra square metre to play with in the room proper. The downside is that the basin is part of the entrance to the room which is aesthetically odd but, more important, means that there is a tendency for the floor area around the basin to get dirty (from outside shoes) and for water to drift from the sink to the carpet. That was the only practical issue I identified that was unavoidable but there were some avoidable issues which should have been addressed..... like a shower door opening onto the wall which contains the towel hooks prevents you from getting to your towels without dripping water everywhere....... and a see-through shower cabin which means the person shaving at the basin gets a ringside view of the action in the shower. Also, the glass and marble materials mean that anyone in the room can not be in a state of ignorance about the activities going on in the wc. So, if you are sharing with a partner or wife with whom you have no secrets about your ablutions or bodily functions, this is a modern, well-fitted hotel in a fantastic location that will just bring you closer. If you are bothered by the minor inconveniences of a misguided attempt to save space and make room for a desk, then perhaps you should try elsewhere. Oh, just one thing, Park Inn, if you are listening....... the knock on the door at 8am followed by another at 8:20 to clean my room was not appreciated.

Ladies, bring your own if you stay there! Also, the bed was strange...we requested a double bed and what we got was 2 twin beds pushed together, each with a separate comforter.

I travelled with my sister and we laughed about it but if you are travelling with someone that you don't know all that well, you certainly will do by the end of your stay! The Internet access at the hotel is expensive - 7.50 euros for 30 minutes. Berlin is a fantastic city. We were only there for four days and only scratched the surface. There is so much to see whatever your interests. Museum Island has many of the main museums in one area, all within walking distance of the hotel. We visited the Pergamon Museum which was amazing. It's worth buying a Berlin Welcome card at 22.90 euros for 72 hours as this will give you easy access to the underground, buses and trams. We hopped on and off trains and buses all the time and made good use of our card. The Welcome card also gives discount on many of the stores and restaurants. It's worth checking out Alberts on 35 Karl-Marx-Alle as mentioned in the Welcome book but please note the free drink on offer is lemonade and 25% discount is off the main menu, not the BBQ that we had which was classed as a special.

If you don't want to walk, Sam did give us a tip and told us that the 100 bus did the same route as the sight seeing bus. We also visited the Reichstag, well worth the 2 hr queue! Either go very early in the morning or in the evening as last entry is at 10.00 pm. The trip to the Charlottenberg Palace was also amazing.

The hotel is very easy to get to from Tegel airport on the TXL bus which is only 2.40E each goes straight to Alexander-Platz (it's the last stop - approx 30 mins). You can't miss the hotel it's the tallest in the city and towers over the square. The Underground is right outside the hotel so you can easily get to all other parts of the city easily plus the S-bahn (overground train) station is also only a 2 min walk from the hotel. There is no swimming pool at this hotel. The staff were friendly when we chacked in all spoke very good English at the desk, we had a standard twin/double room, no breakfast. Breakfast is expensive 18E each but there are loads of little bars and cafes in the square where you can get breakfast from for much much cheaper! Our room was on the 17th floor about half way up. the view was to the back of the hotel (not the square) which was ok but a bit of a building site below. The room was very small and the bathroom is sort of open planned so you can see the shower and sink from the bedroom, they have a shower curtain that you pull round for privacy...!! No tea and coffee making facilities but a reasonably priced mini bar (beer was 3.00E). No iron either but you can ring for one.and no full length mirror. First night ok but in the morning whilst taking a shower in their rather fancy modern rain shower I noticed the basin filling up and the water not draining away, it was then that my boyfriend begain shouting that the room was flooded! The ENTIRE floor of the bedroom was covered in water, it had gone under the bed and all the way up to the door and out to the corridoor(no exagerration). The design of the shower is terrible the water spilled out over the entire floor and because there is no door to the sink/shower area it simply spread out into the room and everywhere! Anything we had left on the floor - including clothes, magazines, chargers, phones etc were soaked. I had to leave the shower still lathered up! I phoned to explained wht had happened and they said they would send soemone up, they did but that person spoke no English and so I rang down again and they asked me to go downstairs to sort the problem out so still soaked with shampoo in my hair I did. Quite embarrasing. They did however apologise and change our room, we got an upgrade to a corner room with a BATHTUB so as to avoid a repeat of the last bedroom we did however have to fashion a fixing to hold the shower head onto the wall as it was broken and would not stay up. They even admitted that it is a poorly designed bathroom. The new room was no different in total sq footage but had a double aspect window with a view over Berlin and the main city which was lovely. All in all we would not stay at the Park Inn ALexanderplatz again, it says its a 4 star and they do charge 4 star prices for food and internet but the accommodations are small and badly designed.

It is a small area cordoned off with mesh/barriers and as a paying guest it is a surprise you pay 3 Euros to have a look. The lounge/bar was not inviting, which was something of a disapointment having seen the pictures and the last thing you want after a long day sightseeing. Also the drinks were on the expensive side at 8.50 Euros for a Jack Daniels and service was not with a smile, while the piano player/singer was of a poor standard, though to be honest not something I would usually listen to. A good tip for a hotel is the small/simple Motel One, across the road heading toward Hackesher Market, where young/pleasant/smiling attentive staff were pleased to see me and only charge 3 Euros for a Jack Daniels (don't get the wrong impression, I'm not a heavy drinker!!) As for Berlin I would be happy to live there, let alone visit on holiday. The locals were friendly and approachable and there is quite a bit to see (it is a cycling city, hire a bike from the Fat Tire Company either for the day yourself or join one of their tours, they are based under the Fernsehturm (big silver ball, communications tower, AlexanderPlatz) Like most big cities abroad, the onset of the evening is enjoyed by families out together as opposed to English towns which are taken over by drunken louts. Only saw four drunks pushing each other, and yep it was four English lads...brilliant. Visit Berlin and you shouldn't be disappointed. It isn't Rome, but it has something. Also, don't waste money on a taxi from the airport, take the TXL 'bendy' bus, caught just outside the front door of the airport.

I also had black out curtains & triple glazed windows, so noise & light wasn't a problem. The shower, toilet, & sink area was spotlessly clean.

The bar is fabulous, comfy couches with big cushions and gorgeous decor. The drinks menu is huge, you won't be dissappointed with the choice! The conceirge by the souvenier shop is very helpful, you can by your sightseeing tickets there, and also tickets for shows and Madame Toussaud's.

The hotel is a base for tour buses, tourist groups, and school children on tour of the capital with their teachers. so if you're looking for a quiet, serene lobby, this hotel is not for you. As the matter of fact, there isn't that much of a lobby. There was some construction outside of the front lobby of the hotel, but the noise was not a factor. The hotel is very close to U and S lines, and very central to attraction points. Alexanderplatz by itself is not my favorite place though. I noticed a lot quieter (but close to action) areas nearby. i didn't eat at the hotel restaurants. Breakfast buffet is charged at 18 Euros which is a tad steep given the fact that a couple of blocks away you could get breakfast at 5-10 Euros. (go towards Hackescher Markt). i had a couple of beers at the lobby bar which is quite nice and has nightly music. i didn't like having to pay 18 Euros per 24 hours for internet access either. It is too steep for American standards. The gym is tiny. No weights, just some thread-mills at a very small/no windows room. Credit to the hotel: you don't see the gym advertised on their website.

The Spagos on the lobby level served very good food, in my opinion, for a reasonable price given that it's a hotel. - Reasonably quiet -- slept well. - Fast internet (but not cheap) Here are the not so good: - Really small rooms, with limited space for suitcase, clothes, etc. The closets are functional, but if you're two people with a lot of luggage, the regular rooms won't work for you. - Each room has a shower and toilet, but not exactly private.

No. That would be just incompetence. I arrived, and was told that I would have to pay for my room in advance, which seemed strange, but it was late and I just wanted to go to bed so... I go up to my room a little disappointed to see that it was only on the fourth floor, but much more disappointed to find that it is barely 10m2 with one small window, no bath. So I go back to reception to point out the mistake, only to be told that this is actually their \"Executive Room\". While I appreciated the \"Executive\" status this gave me; really I just wanted the room that I had made the reservation for (and just been made to pay for in advance). No. Apparently my reservation was for the \"Executive Room\". Which coincidently was the exact same price as the much larger room with the bath and the view but no \"Executive\" in the name. So since it was the same price it would be simple to swap me over to the non-executive room, yes? No? Alas there were no rooms fitting my description available, if only I'd made a reservation... I hadn't expected to have to print out the reservation as evidence, but luckily managed to retrieve an email on my mobile that they had sent me as confirmation, which included the following lines: Room Type: Business Panorama Room Approximate size of room: 24 m\u00b2, complete window front in two directions, marble bathroom with bath tub and heated floors, ................ Minibar, Hair dryer Aaaah, that room, of course, yes, now he understood, after seeing written evidence which I was more than willing to pass around the other witnesses on my side of the reception desk in an attempt to cause as big a scene as possible. They would issue me a new key immediately, now had I taken anything from the \"Executive\" mini bar during my five second stay in the room?

We flew into Schonefeld and there are two airport express trains that stop at Alexanderplatz the RE7 and RB14. We used the train. However, there is also an airport bus which has a similar journey length. Buy the Berlin Card at the Tourist Info desk in the airport (turn right after baggage reclaim) this gives you unlimited use of all public transport in Berlin. You can purchase different periods ie 72 hours. It also gives numerous discounts at museums, attractions and restaurants. Please note that you must validate the card before use ie to start the clock running. The cards can be validated on the train platforms at very inconspicuous short red boxes on grey columns (there were no signs). After that its great, just one word of warning you need to carefully plot you routes around the city e.g. the underground has several lines and you will probably need to change a few times and possibly use all modes of transport to get about to your chosen destinations. Also be careful what exit of the underground you leave by since you may find yourself heading the wrong direction. That said it is wonderful. Tip for finding the hotel - leave the station from the Dircksenstrasse exit and you should be facing a square across which is an entrance to the hotel. The hotel is unmissable being extremely tall. The hotel room is very comfortable and clean. There is a free to use safe. There is no tea/coffee making facility. As noted previously the rooms have glass walled wc and shower (the wc is obscure glass, however you can see through it) and so if sharing with a friend I hope you are not too easily embarrassed. I guess it's a British hang up. There is a privacy curtain which helps your modesty a bit - however there is no sound proofing between the wc and the room - turn up the TV. I couldn't imagine my parents being too enamored with the arrangement. Another tip is to hang the do not disturb sign on the door as the cleaner just knocks and enters - you have been warned! We booked through Lastminute.com and got the room for 3 nights for \u00a3175. We didn't eat at the Park Inn, I think the breakfast is about 18 euro and it is very easy to find cafes or bakeries all around serving any kind of food at vastly cheaper prices. We didn't pay anything like 18 euro for 'two' of us, never mind each! For evening dining you are spoilt for choice we ate at an Italian called Soleno in the Nikolai area. It is a small cosy budget restaurant and very nice and good value for money. We also ate at Thai Inside on Dircksenstrasse 37, this is an excellent restaurant with fantastic presentation to the dishes - every one a photograph. The food was delicious and reasonably priced, its to be recommended and is a short stroll to the Park Inn. We also ate at Corroboree at Bellevuetrasse 5 in the Sony centre at Potsdammer Platz. This is an Australian type eatery and is ok - it has croc and kangaroo. Plenty of pubs around also although watch out they seem to be able to smoke in part of the premises and you can therefore get a bit of smoke filtering through. Main sites visited include the usual Reichstag, Brandenburg gate etc; A good trip is on the Spree which gives a great view of the city and some of the new buildings. I'm an architect and the architecture of Berlin is excellent. A visit to the Bauhaus archive is worthwhile although its empty of exhibitions the building is a delight. I would also recommend the Jewish Museum both for the exhibits but also to experience the building - it is quite unsettling. The holocaust memorial is very moving. Checkpoint Charlie is unfortunately a touristy attraction with photographs and stamped postcards its a bit tacky and sadly a bit disrespectful of those who died during the cold war years trying to escape.

The room design is a little unconventional, as reported by other reviewers; the shower is separated from the sleeping area by only a glass wall. However, a curtain can be drawn to separate the two areas. But couples travelling together who may not be too intimate, might want to consider this before booking. There's little I can fault this hotel on - the staff do seem a little cold - A sign at reception says something like, \"Wait here for the next smile\" but smiles were few and far between from the staff. It didn't really bother me; perhaps I'm just looking for a bad comment to make. When I checked in, there was no line up but I did notice, at other times, very loing lineups for checkin.

She gave me a map and two great places to go and added 'if you come back tonight before 10.00pm I'll have more information for you'. which I did, she provided me with an A5 piece of paper. She'd noted down every day I was staying and then provided the best places to go on that day - wonderful! The room - immaculately clean, very efficient. I've noticed some travellers say the rooms are small, which to a certain extent is true however if you put your bags under the desk provided there is more than enough space for two people. Bathrooms - at first seem unconventional, but when you use the shower it all makes sense, everything is where you need it to be. The seperate toilet works well. I did use the shower on arrival and the water flooded into my room - I informed reception then i ventured out into the city. Within an hour I returned, the room had been cleaned, the floor dried and I was provided with complimentary slippers incase any moisture remained in the carpet. In my opinion, this was excellent. The shower didnt flood again, the previous occupant had dropped those plastic covers that come on razorblades in to the drainage - this was also sorted. Location - Berlin is a vast city - things do feel spread out. German public transport is incredible, which makes up for this. You can step out of this hotel and be straight on public transport to anywhere you want to be. Restaurant - I didnt eat here, why eat at a hotel when you've got a city within arms reach? Breakfast - I noticed one traveller said that they couldnt get breakfast added on. When I arrived I was told I could add breakfast at any point, even in the morning. I went to the reception one morning and I was offered breakfast, so it didnt seem like a problem (the selection always looked good too.) Final thoughts - I think this is a fantastic hotel, I will be staying here again without a doubt and Berlin is a wonderful city (take the free walkking tour). The cleaning staff are there every morning - for seperate people knocked on the door, but to be fair I didnt get up until midday. Simply put the 'do not disturb' sign on the door - you'll have no worries. As regards to the minibar - prices are just above average. They don't monitor whats in here electronically or anything like that and someone comes to fill it every day.

As we were going to Berlin for the first time and as Schonefeld airport was our landing place, we decided to make matter simple and book one of hotels that have good connection with airport. Our choice was Park Inn. After seven nights in Park Inn, our impressions are as follows: - Location - basically, it's excellent. 20-25 minutes from Schonefeld airport by Airport Express (RE7 and RB 14) train that leaves every 30 minutes; almost all major (all that average tourist need) U-bahn and S-bahn lines goes through Alexanderplatz and their stations are from 50(U-Bahn) to 150(S-Bahn) meters from west hotel entrance; also, if you like to walk, even Unter den Linden and Brandenburg Tor are not that far away (20-30 minutes?); hotel is near the place where the original settlement of Berlin was found and although most of old buildings in area were destroyed during WW2, they were faithfully rebuilt later. - Service - we haven't had breakfast or any other meal in hotel, so I can't say anything about that, but rooms were kept very clean (daily service) and all of the staff that we have had contact with, spoke english pretty good. - Room - we had room on 11th floor and we were very pleased with it. After reading some of the reviews on tripadvisor, we were afraid that the room is going to be very small, but in reality it wasn't. I can't say that room is large, but there is more than enoguh place for two people to enjoy it. Furniture is modern and looks stylish, there is a mini bar (prices are ok) , flat screen tv and room safe (large enough for camera, SLR, flash and objectives). There is in-room Internet connection, and although I can't remember the price, i remember thinking that it was very expensive. As for location and look of the toilet and shower bath, that can be a problem if you travel with someone other than your spouse :) ... altough modern, toilet and shower bath are located at the corner of the room, and surrounded by glass so you can see other person showering (toilet is surrounded by some material that is not as transparent :)). Of course, there is a curtain that hides both shower bath and toilet from the rest of your room and prying eyes of your roommate :) ... and not to forget, our room type was \"business class room\".

Recomend to buy a day card for th zones A,B or A,B,C which is valid until next day 3AM. Had a single room which was light and fresh, small but in some way spacious. A really negative thing was that the TV screen was placed right at the wall, and just slightly turned, which made it almost impossible to watch TV from the bed, but anyway, theres so much in the town to see... The bathroom were in verry special, design, not sure so smart, I understood the idea and concept, but after showering the water sometimes floods out(though small amounts, but anyway) on the carpetfloor, which makes me feel that the hotel might get some problems with damage by damp in the future. No minibar or safe in room is a minus. My room didnt face the TV twr, a pity really, but I could stand with it. The Breakfest buffet was really great, but not sure if worth the price? I mean, 18 Euros for a breakfest (they just increased the price from 17E), its probably the most expensive breakfest Ive had, and for that price they could be more serviceminded in the restaurant! The fitnessroom/gym is fatal, thyve just put a few machines in there (2for running, 1 cycle, 1 other), a verry booring and dull room, felt dirty and unfresh, how can they call something like that, on a 4star hotel, a fitness room/gym!???

I told them that we were a party of 5 and that the others would be arriving later on. No problem we were told. However, the first room we were given was a double, not a twin. On returning to the reception we were told that they had no twin rooms free. After some polite but firm negotiation we were finally given a twin room. Happy, we went off to for a meal before our friends arrived. Our friends arrived at midnight, but on trying to check in were told that the hotel was full and they would have to move to another hotel, despite the fact that the rooms were booked 3 months in advance. I complained that we were a group and would not be split up. So instead they sent us all by free taxi to the 5-star superior Westin Grand hotel at no extra charge. We stayed there for one night (please see separate review), had free taxi rides there and back, free breakfasts at both hotels and were also given an upgrade on our return to the Park Inn.

On arriving back the next morning at the Park Inn, the reception staff were already fully briefed about our situation and were extremely helpful, especially Ms P. Sanchez. The Park Inn itself is a great hotel and well situated in the city (close to the airport too). The rooms were nice (though a bit small) and the fears about the weird toilet arrangements were unfounded. Good breakfast, though I probably wouldn't pay 20 euros for it. NB. Ask for a West facing, upper floor room for a great view of the Fernsehturm. I would happily recommend this hotel, but they clearly overbook in the hope that not everyone shows up. If you are planning to arrive late I would bear this in mind when booking though maybe we were just unlucky, as that weekend the hotel was full of swimmers, in town for the World Cup meeting later that week.

Our room was in the 23rd floor of the hotel ( the hotel is huge with at least 30 floors and hundreds of rooms) facing the TV tower and the square. The view was very nice, but for us the basic problem was the heating. The central heating of the room didn't work; the room was not cold, but it was not hot either. But with outisde temperature under 0, you can understand that without central heating somebody starts to freeze. We communicated with the reception and they sent a technician to check it, who said that nothing can be done and that the central heating system wouldn't work. So we asked to change room; they put us in another room 10 floors down, which was again very cold and again the central system didn't work. So, we decided to return back to the first room, even if it's cold to have better view. Finally from the reception they arranged us an electric portable heater, that helped us a lot; but without it, it would be impossible to stay in the room. The room was cleaned every day; we were disappointed to find 2 single beds united instead of one double bed as we had asked, but most probably there were not double beds.

Berlin does have a fantastic transport system however and it is very easy to get anywhere in a short space of time.Anyone that is arriving to Berlin on a Sunday the shops are closed so you can do your city tour then which is good value and you can hop on and hop off when you like.Eating out is cheap in Berlin with a vast variety of places to eat.

We had requested an upper west facing room, and that is exactly what we were provided with. The lift at the hotel took no time at all to shoot us up to the 26th floor, and the view upon opening the curtains was fantastic, as we gazed upon the Fernsehturm and down towards the Reichstag in the distance. We were very pleased with the room itself. Admittedly, it was quite small, but the ergonomics of the room mean that you don't feel cramped. The bathroom facility layout is a little out of the ordinary, in that there is no bath 'room' as such, simply glass partitions between the toilet, shower and sink. I wouldn't fancy sharing a room with the boss or someone I was not intimately acquainted with, as the partitions leave very little to the imagination. Still, the duvets on the comfortable bed were fantastic, and there was a nice flat screen tv and minibar in the room, and plenty of storage space.

We didn't have breakfast at the hotel; there is a very nice Bistro next door to the hotel on the square that offers reasonably priced breakfasts.

Worse, in my mind, is the fact that a clear space between the two mattresses therefore opens up, because of their softness.

We found that to be true, and we couldn't have been happier with our decision to stay at the Park Inn. It's location is fantastic. The Alexanderplatz station makes it convenient to get anywhere in town via subway or train. Just a short walk north of the hotel puts you in an area full of cute, modern restaurants and bars. Head west one stop on the S line to Hackescher Markt, and the plaza is full of restaurants with outdoor seating.

On first sight, I thought, \"Oh, no!\" It looked like one of those Communist mega hotels, and indeed it is in Alexanderplatz which Honecker intended as a DDR showpiece of Stalinist architecture. I only agreed to stay because it was almost the only place with room over the bank holiday. (Once again, I thought \"Oh, no!\" what's the problem with it?) But - I was so surprised. I really liked it and would return again. Our room was on the 11th floor, a reasonable size, modern and well fitted in dark brown and chrome. It was very clean and the beds were very comforatble. Towels were nice and toiletries smelt good although they weren't well known brands. We paid 18 Euros for 2 to have breakfast but others seem to have paid 18 Euros each? Maybe we got a bargain or they paid too much ?? But anyway check the price and I can assure you it was really excellent, with a huge choice of items. It included 3 types of scrambled egg, Nuremberger sausages, yogurt meusli, little pastry cases to put jam in, lots of different types of bread and rolls, cakes, salads, cheese, fruit - including passion fruit and other exotics, lots of different types of tea, and more. We made a point of eating a large breakfast so we didn't have to have much lunch. By the way, there are 2 breakfast places. One is a sort of ocean liner type dining room, which is quite grand, the other is in the bar downstairs which we preferred because it was bright and (when the sun shone) sunny and in our view had more interesting food. I don't think they give you a choice of breakfast room after your room is allocated - so check this at the time of booking. The hotel was very well soundproofed and quiet, despite being so large. There is a concierge, which was a plus. The reading lights were good, with an extra LCD light on a stalk attached to each one so you didn't have to keep your partner awake while reading. There is a safe and mini bar, etc. Theres also a wellness centre with massages which I didn't use so can't comment on. One reviewer commented on the disconcerting frosted glass in the shower and toilet. This is true but you can pull a curtain around to conceal the blurred sight of your room-mate showering or sitting on the toilet. There is a separate shower and toilet, which to me was a plus. No bath, though. Alexanderplatz is not beautiful but it is quite a lively square and right across from the hotel is a huge and good 6 storey department store which also has a food hall. The U2 underground line is steps away, and you're in walking distance of Hackischer Markt - a fascinating older area of Berlin with loads of good restaurants. You can also walk to many places of interest, although be warned, places in Berlin seem to be very spread out and there's always lots of walking. One evening we had a buffet supper in the hotel, that was 19 euros each and once again a huge variety, it's not that exciting to eat in the hotel when Berlin has so many unusual restaurants but it suited us well since we were tired and didn't want to go out. I read from a guidebook that the hotel had some rooms which were not renovated,but this may have changed by now. That is probably something else to check in advance. We felt it was good value for money. As it is a very large hotel you do run the risk of having to wait at busy times to check in and check out.

Since the Park Inn is the tallest building in Berlin the views are spectacular especially from the higher floors. My wife found the noise level from the construction in the front of the hotel (facing east) to be annoying, but the hotel allowed us to switch our room without hesitation or additional cost to a slightly larger room on the western side. The breakfast buffet, which was included, in our room rate, was typical. Boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, cereal, sliced meats, rolls,yogurt etc. Grab the cake as soon as you get in on busy days or you might not get a piece. Convenience is terrific. The S and U train are right outside and the Galleria department store is adjacent. The TXL bus from Tegel airport stops a half-block away and costs only 2.1 Euros! The room was equipped with a flat screen TV but all but two channels are in German. Only English-language stations were Sky News and CNBC but who comes to Berlin to watch TV? Check out was painless. We settled our bill the night before and simply left the key in the room. There is a small gym available for hotel guests and many of the rooms have Wifi internet connection but you must ask in advance I would guess. We did not use this feature.

The Park Inn Hotel in Alexanderplatz Square in Berlin (Old East Berlin) is a very nice place to stay. Shopping, bus, tram, subway and tourist attractions are all within walking distance. Alexanderplatz has many places to shop. This hotel could not be more ideally situated for the tourist. The staff throughout the hotel is friendly. The bar and restaurants are nice and the food is better than most hotel offerings. The morning buffet breakfast at the Spasso Lounge is excellent. Live music on the weekends at the bar (Spasso's Lounge) was very nice. A very relaxing place to sit back and have a cocktail after being on the run all day. The Concierge at the Park Inn was excellent. Not only can they book tourist attractions, they also can book restaurant reservations and make suggestions on places to see, do and eat. You can also buy your daily City Pass (6,20 Euros) from the Concierge that allows you to take any public form of transportation for the entire day (Bus, Subway, and Tram). Now the Downs.... The rooms in the place are tiny. Now when I say tiny, I mean tiny. The price is very good for Berlin, but be prepared for cramped quarters. The restrooms seem to have been a second thought for this place. The shower, sink and toilet are all separate, but the toilet and shower are enclosed in GLASS stalls. The toilet area is smaller than most stalls you would encounter at a shopping mall restroom. The shower was large enough to move around. However, make sure you are traveling with someone close and personal to you, as there is absolutely no privacy in the shower or toilet. I mean to say; when you use the restroom (toilet or shower) you are sharing your experience with everyone else in the room! The Hotel check-in is at 2pm. Remember, this place is huge (over 1000 rooms). If you arrive early, the counter staff will not permit you to check in until after 2pm. What does this mean? Well, at 2pm there is a mad dash for check-in and an enormous line builds up. The wait for me was over 30 minutes in this line. I felt sorry for those even farther back in line waiting to check in. However, if you arrive early, the counter staff will take your luggage and deliver it to your room after you check in. The hotel has a viewing deck on the upper floor. However, even though you are a paying guest of the hotel, you still have to pay 3 Euros to get off on this floor to see the views. This Hotel also has a casino on the upper floor. However, there is a dress code for men. Men must wear slacks and a tie to get in. No exceptions day or night. If the doorman does not like what you are wearing, you will not be allowed inside. Even though the hotel advertises it offers WiFi on all floors, be aware this is not the case. In fact, there are several floors that do not have WiFi service. Make sure to ask for a floor with WiFi if you want to connect to the Internet. All in All, this hotel was a great choice and definitely above average.

We did not have a room rate with breakfast but there is a reasonable cafe at one of the hotel entrances (on square rather than main road side) next to a burger king, which save you money as we ate and drank there for about 5 euros and I think breakfast was at least double this at the hotel. There is a casino and a restuarant in the hotel but I did not try either of these out. I note people comments about the slowness of service at reception - we had a problem as we were allocated to two rooms which had not been cleaned and finally on the third try we got lucky! I was disappointed at the lack of apology but on realising that I had left paperwork in one of the rooms (which had since been cleaned) there were incredibly helpful and located the papers in the bin for me and returned them.

I stayed here for 3 nights over 4 days, and was stunned by how good this hotel was. I paid \u00a380 per night (not that expensive considering \u00a360-\u00a380 can get you a dump in central London) through Thomas Cook. I chose this location due to the fact that the hotel had great reviews, and because it was slap bang in the middle of the must-see areas. The public transportation to the sights was impressive, but it is even better to walk, in my opinion. After arriving from Schoenefeld airport via S-Bahn 9 (easily gotten to from the airport, just follow the signs by foot) at Alexanderplatz, I emerged from the station to see the imposing TV tower on one side, and the very impressive looking (well it would be at 37 stories tall) Park Inn hotel on the other. Amazing first impression. The main lobby is very posh and imposing. The reception staff were very efficient and helpful during check-in. There are 12 lifts that cater to different floors - and my lift took me to the 30th floor in what seemed to be 5 seconds or so. There are about 30 rooms to each floor - each room being 10-12 feet wide and 40 feet long. So they did seem to be small, but they were impeccable. There was a double bed made up of 2 single beds joined together - not ideal perhaps, but at least you got your own duvet if sleeping with a partner - but as I was alone it didn't concern me. I wouldn't of been bothered if I was with someone to be honest and I don't consider this arrangement to be a terrible thing. The room had the \"legendary\" glass-cased shower / toilet combo that feels like you are using public toilets. Sure, they seem odd and will definitely cause embarrassment to those not fully comfortable with each others \"toilet habits\", but this IS Germany! The shower was fantastic and had lots of room. It was also well sealed when the door was closed, so no water leaked onto the tiled floor. Also in the room is a flat screen LCD TV (complete with hardcore porn, so put the child-lock on it if you are going with minors), mini bar (beer, wine, snacks etc.. very handy), hair dryer, iron / ironing board, plenty of wardrobe and drawer space. Basically everything you needed was there - EXCEPT a room safe. However, if you ask at reception, they will give you access to a private safety deposit box (like in a bank) in the back room behind reception, and there you can deposit whatever you like (I put my passport, housekeys and UK cash in there). This service is free, invaluable, and is recommended by the hotel itself. I feel that safety in the hotel is top notch though, as there are plenty of staff around, so hopefully no ne'er-do-wells can just wander in (although they \"could\", as there are two entrances that aren't constantly staffed - although people who shouldn't be there would probably be intercepted by reception before they made it to the lifts). I left valuables in my room without any qualms. Good Points: 1) Excellent hotel overall 2) Excellent location for the sights (including the ladies at Hackescher Markt of an evening) 3) Excellent location for nightlife 4) Seemed safe and secure 5) Housekeeping was fantastic and unobtrusive (\"do not disturb\" signs needed on door handle of course) 6) Just generally very good :) Bad Points: 1) Alexanderplatz is home to lots of scruffy youths (skinhead types) who congregate all day at the fountain in the main square / plaza, drinking and being very loud. It gets MUCH worse of an evening, when the local kids join in at the base of the TV tower. It seems to get very rowdy, but I had no trouble walking through the area of an evening. Not a nice sight though, so be warned. 2) The breakfast was awful in my opinion. I sampled it once and never went back, despite it being a free buffet. It consisted of cereals (that's fine, but not my thing), different types of scrambled eggs with odd flavours, hot dog sausages (for breakfast?), roast potatoes (I kid you not). The coffee tasted like.. well.. I have no idea what it tasted like, but it sure wasn't coffee :) The workers in the restaraunt were efficient and helpful, so the effort was there. 3) Despite the people on reception doing a great job, they did seem a little \"moody\", but this was something I noted amongst a lot of German people. The women may be pretty, but they never smile :( Overall, this hotel is fantastic and comes highly recommended.

A must visit is the Lemke Brauhouse where you get to sample a selection of the local beers before selecting which one (or ones) you wish to have. Next door is Riva Bar where they have an amazing list of cocktails available. It is a little pricey (2 cocktails averaging 17 euro) but they are well worth it. Following the road right round you come to a small square where you'll find several more bars where you can sit outside or if you fancy a dance a must is AM to PM, more great cocktails and a jumping wee dancefloor. During the day the area is just as nice with loads of shops with favourites like Adidas, Hugo Boss as well as one off boutiques. Just strolling around you'll find and eclectic mix of shops and I'm sure spy a nice restaurant to come back to that night. If you are there to sightsee, it is all so accessible thanks to teh location. We travelled to the Reichstag, Jewish Museum, Checkpoint Charlie, Zoo and Brandenburg Gate using the public transport. It was very punctual, clean and safe no matter what time of the day. Just dont forget to buy a ticket before you board and validate it at the wee machines next to the ticket machines. If you dont have one you will be fined 40 euro!!

The location is good, within walking distance of many of Berlin's sights and directly opposite the TV Tower in the centre of the large Alexanderplatz. The square itself has a train station which connects to the Schoenefeld Airport via the Airport Express. It has shops, restaurants and bars and is on both the Tram and Underground lines. Once the development around the square is complete, it should look neat and tidy. Because the rooms in the hotel are so far up there is no noise from outside, the windows being triple glazed. This also makes for superb views over the city. It also means that its almost impossible to lose your way home since either the hotel or the TV tower are nealy always in view. Rooms themselves are very small and cramped for two people, but are functional and the beds are fine. The flat-screen TV is nice although there are only the standard 18 or so channels that you get in most European hotels, but you do get Sky News. The bathrooms are a bit odd since the walls are made of glass but luckily our toilet door was frosted and the shower could be cut off from the rest of the room with a curtain although it makes it a little bit awkward if you're sharing with someone you're not intimate with! Bear in mind that not all rooms are the same so the bathroom layout and seclusion levels could be different, for example there was no curtain separating the bathroom area from the rest of the room in one of the rooms two of our party were sharing. There was a safety deposit box in our room although some of our friends didn't have one, however the hotel and Berlin as a whole felt very safe. The rooms were always nice and clean when we returned and we had no problem with the service albeit we didn't need to use it much. The disappointing point was that the rooftop terrace bar was never open, which I couldn't understand in the middle of summer on a weekend. Seems a bit of a waste of revenue to me. Anyway, the lobby bar was pleasant enough. We got a great deal on the price due to booking a flight-hotel package, so it was nowhere near the standard tariffs.

The room was lovely and clean, beds comfortable (although with only 1 pillow each, I'd recommend asking for extra pillows at reception) and the bathroom fantastic - even if it was a little weird only being separated by frosted glass from the rest of the room.

I'd recommend buying a day ticket for zones A & B at 6 Euros each which you can use until 3am the following morning. The trains are so efficient and pretty clean, it was a dramatic change from the Public transport in the UK. We also walked from the hotel down to Berliner Dom, Brandenburg Gate, The Reichstag and then back along the river to the Pergamon Museum, which took longer than expected, but that may have been due to the heat and the fact I was wearing flip flops - not a good choice! In the evening we went to Hackesche Markt which was ok with a view bars and cafes but not the liveliest of places. Since coming back I've discovered we may have been better venturing to Ku'Dam - another time maybe!! Oranienburger Strasse is tipped as a good and lively place to go also but we didn't find it to be like that and were a bit disappointed by it.

Having said that, it was a little odd that the bath/shower in our room had no wall, but a glass panel which was open to the room, but hey, open plan is great too. As the Park Inn is Berlin's tallest building, naturally the views are spectacular, although cleaning the windows more often would make this view more enjoyable. The hotel is in Alexander Platz, which is central and near a very convenient U-Bahn line that runs through the main tourist sites, although the square itself is soulless and lacking any charm. Plenty of shops in the nearby platz and in the Galleria Kaufhof behind the hotel. Check in/out was all very efficient, and the staff are very friendly. The hotel also has a terrace on the higher floors (Floor 39, I think) and is an excellent and relaxing place to have a quick drink in the evening before planning your night-life excursions. Having said that, if you are an English speaker, there is only 2 English channels available in the room (both news!)... some kind of satellite or cable choice would have been great, especially for a hotel that advertises itself as international. I was also very disappointed in the lack of wireless internet, although wired internet (via LAN cable) was available in the room, but at a ridiculous cost.Personally, I don't think expecting free or affordable in-room internet access to those who need it is unreasonable. Overall, a great place to stay for comfort and cost, but you could probably do better finding a hotel in more pleasant surroundings than the very drab Alexander Platz. A few tips when in Berlin: Give yourself plenty of time to explore the museums, but if time is limited, the Pergamon is a must if only for the Istar Gates of Ancient Babylon. Museums open until 10pm on Thursday and are free. Check Point Charlie is a little bit on the touristy side (the checkpoint itself isn't the original, just a mock up), but the museum next to it is quite good. If the weather is good, a stroll in the Tiergarten is a nice way to spend the afternoon. A day U-Bahn ticket is a great and very inexpensive way to get around, the U-Bahn (and S-Bahn's) are very safe and clean - if you want to go a little further outside Berlin, get the three zone ticket (Zones A, B, & C), its not much dearer.", "Date": "May 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincolnshire, UK", "Title": "\u201cNice\u201d", "Author": "MarkRoddis", "ReviewID": "UR7479461", "Content": "I have just returned from a 3 day trip to Berlin and a stay in the Park Inn I arrived as part of a large group close to midnight yet check in was quick, efficient and accurate and I was in my room on the 16th floor in a matter of minutes. I am aware however that the coach that arrived at 2 found that although their rooms were pre paid (not just pre booked) ended up in a nearby 5 star hotel (at the Park Inns expense) because the Park Inn chose to overbook. Don't you just hate it when hotels do that? Anyway my room was very modern with a double bed (well 2 twins put together) and a small table by the window. Plenty of cupboard and hanging space and overall, a perfectly good room. As mentioned in other reviews the the glass walled shower does mean that you should only ever share one of these rooms if you are happy for the person you are sharing with seeing you naked in the shower. The room was served by wireless internet access for which there was a charge however as I use iPass I cannot tell you how much it would have cost but it did work fine. The mini bar was of the over flowing type by which I mean that there were other items such as bottles of water and crisps spread around the room which were all to be paid for if used. The cost of the minibar was not cheap although I don't think the words mini bar and cheap go together anywhere anyway. As the weather in Berlin was stunning this week (27 degrees) I spent some time up on the rooftop terrace on the 39th floor. It cost \u20ac3 to get in and did seem a bit makeshift but had a bar, music and deckchairs and the 2nd best view in Berlin (the first being the TV tower next door) so \u20ac3 was cheeky but a cost I was prepared to pay. Breakfast was however a joke. It is a large hotel and the breakfast area is large as well but there is no seating help so you just find yourself a table if you can. One morning, 2 of us spent the best part of 10 minutes walking around trying to find a table and some people were starting to argue about people taking their tables. This is plain daft and the hotel needs to do something about it. Transport from the hotel could not be better. It is right next the the station where you can get over ground trains, under ground trains, trams and busses. You can buy an all day ticket that covers the whole system for \u20ac6.30 which offers fantastic value for money considering the trains were frequent and quick. I caught the over ground from the hotel to the ICC which is the other side of town and it took 25 minutes door to door. The same journey by taxi took 45 minutes.

Getting there very late at night I got a taxi, which wasn't a fortune compared to UK prices. First impressions were, \"wow, the tv tower at night next door looks really lovely\", but looking at the hotel I thought \"am I going to the office\"?!! This is because the exterior of the hotel isn't what you would call classy. However, as soon as I stepped inside, I knew I had picked the right place! Very modern, tip top condition, spotlessly clean, and soundproof. Excellent value for money, considering it's location and views, couldn't believe my luck! I asked for the highest floor possible and was very very happy to have been offered a room on the 34th floor which was smack opposite the tv tower - that was it, I was totally mesmerised by that view, I only wish I could have captured that lit-up, night-time view from my room on camera (sigh). Again, the room was spotless, and very swish. As it was just me I didn't mind the wc having just a glass door, in fact I thought it was ultra trendy! The bedding, I just have to tell you, was the most comfortable ever - I cannot describe it, but the material and weight of that duvet was sheer luxury. Each night I slept like a baby! The hotel was brilliantly situated for the olde Jewish quarter, and for tram rides eastbound outside the city, but also what was great, was, right next door to the hotel was a massive C & A dept store - for us from the UK this is a luxury, for there are no more C & A stores in the UK anymore, so I was pleased to have a store on my doorstep! Also, a U-bahn, S-bahn, and a tour bus all there for the asking, just a few feet away, and, a huge dept store adjoining the hotel, with I might add the most amazing range of chocolates! The hotel has a terrace roof which only opens at certain times and under certain weather conditions, but if you ask nicely, someone will let you go up there, on the roof, to take a few photos - incredible to be so high up, from where you can see all of Berlin's major architecture. Decided to eat in the a la carte restaurant on the 2nd floor. Asked for the pork meal, but the staff advised me not to order it, as it wasn't a pork chop, but a whole leg of pork - for one!!!! Ordered another dish, couldn't even eat that there was so much of it, but the desserts well I had to have some of that so I found room! The only criticism I have is the breakfast - it's an average affair. Granted there's lots of choice, but as a Brit I found all the herbs and sausage meats and breads too heavy and spicey/herby first thing in the morning, but it was great to have a whole jug full of coffee on the table so I could drink as much as I liked. I would definitely stay here again and, as one of the previous posters wrote, it's best to ask for a room away from the lifts. By the time I left, I kinda liked the way the exterior looked, and, where-ever I went in east Berlin, I could spot my hotel from afar, even from the plane when it flew over Berlin before hitting the clouds, and just thinking about the Park Inn now makes me smile; I know I'll return there again!", "Date": "February 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rock in Ireland", "Title": "\u201cBelfast Ireland\u201d", "Author": "Slatequarry", "ReviewID": "UR6805905", "Content": "Just returned from a 5 day break in Hotel.

I suppose it depends on facing as well. But if you take the rooms overlooking the platz, you can be assured of an astounding view of the TV tower, Berliner Dom, town hall etc. The rooms we were given initially was on a higher floor (>20th) but the bed was merely a queen size which could not fit in ourselves plus the baby. We asked for a change and was given one on a lower floor (17th) but 2 singles pushed together which gave us a slighter large one. This room however was in the end of the corridor and thus had 2 sets of windows which gave us a wrap around view of the platz and beyond which we were extremely happy with! See attached pics. The outer glass windows was quite grimy unfortunately so the quality of photos taken from the room suffers accordingly. They do however have a viewing gallery from the top of the building but unfortunately it was closed during out time there. Geographically, Alexanderplatz is in the formal Eest Berlin, you can walk to museum island from here and most other places you want to see are but a short tube ride away although you may need to make 2 and sometimes more transfer. People with buggies like us would be pleased to know that most stations in the heavier touristed area has elevators. You will have to navigate stairs in other smaller stations. The room is pretty standard as far as such hotel chains are concerned. Fairly comfortable beds and pillows. Cleanliness was kept to a high standard. Already noted was the clear glass enclosure of the bath/shower/sink area. The WC is kept from view but a frosted glass door. A curtain can be used to wrap around the glass enclosures to hide it from view. I suppose they would have erected dry walls for the more prudish of us but the clear glass is great if you want to luxuriate in the bath and watch TV at the same time! TV by the way was a 20\u201d Loewe LCD panel. English channels are limited to sky news and CNBC. No CNN but I could be wrong there. But I wasn\u2019t in Berlin to watch TV. :) Transport wise, you are right at the doorstep to the U-Bahn and the S-Bahn access is about 200-300 metres away across the platz. Although your transport tickets are good for all transport, the S-Bahn and the U-Bahn are not as geographically intimate as the tube maps will suggest. Transfer between these 2 forms of tranport almost always requires a platform change and sometimes a short walk to transfer from one to the other. We did not take the trams or buses as the tubes will plenty good in getting us to most places we want to get to. We leg it for everything else. As already noted, the room rates through expedia does NOT include breakfast which is levied at an extra 15 Euros per person. In case you are not disinclined to part with such large sums for breakfast, there is a couple of small restaurants and a Burger King just downstairs next to the lobby. There is also a small caf\u00e9 in the shopping centre in the building next to the hotel. There is large shopping mall next to the hotel.

The bar/cafe in the lobby breezeway had free Internet if you were eating or drinking, but they didn't take credit cards or allow charges to the room. What the hell? Who doesn't take credit cards in a major European city in a major hotel anymore? The other complaint is just the sheer size of the hotel and the size of the groups the place attracts. It reminded me of the days of the Hotel Rossiya in Moscow. You'd see 4 tour buses pull up out front and all of the sudden the lobby would be full of 300 new check-ins and you'd have a devil of a time using the elevator or just walking out the door.

As for the hotel, the room was very modern and well equipped (trouser press, tv, computer socket, minibar & fridge, plenty of cupboard space) with excellent views over the Western side of the city, we would of preferred to get a room on the other side of the hotel as this is where all the main sights of Berlin can be seen from, including the Radio Tower which is a breathtaking site! We spent a lot of time in the casino on the top floor which has even better 360 degree views of the city. Drinks were a little on the expensive side, a pint being 5 euros but we cant complain as we did quite well on the Blackjack Table (minimum stake 10 euro). We found the staff to be very professional but not particularly friendly . The hotel was very clean and kept tidy and their was a good choice of food layed out for the inclusive breakfast. The pate was the one item I would say i liked the most. As for the location, well you probably cant pick a better hotel. If you drive you've got access to the major arteries right outside the hotel. Every main historical site is within a good walking distance ie: reichstag, berlin wall, brandenberg gate and all the parks and rivers etc! You've got restaurants and cafes closeby and all the main fast food places are next door at the train station subway, mcdonalds etc. If you like shopping, you could spend half a day in the Galeria department store again about 20 metres from the door of the hotel!! They sell everything from food to tv's and clothes even, good prices too! As mentioned in some of the previous reviews, there was some biulding work going on near the hotel, but caused no problem whatsoever, certainly didnt keep either of us awake, partly because of being so high up i suppose and the beds are very comfy so we had an excellent nights sleep!

The bathroom set-up with the shower/toilet in the room was a bit odd, but the closets were nice and there was plenty of storage space. If the hotel had fluffy towels, I would have given them an \"Excellent\" rating. I enjoyed the built-in lamps by the bed and the nice comforter. Plus, the cleaning staff folded my pajamas for me. My sense was that the hotel gets lots of large groups, but it also works well for the individual traveler. Of the amenities, I only used the spa.

The best part of the hotel is its central location in Alex. The underground station is just a few yards from the hotel entrance and you can easily get about to where ever you need. It is also an easy walk to Unter den Linten. Also something useful to know is a taxi ride from the hotel to Tegel airport is around 20 euros, I paid 17.50 I think. Also good to know is there is a Burger King attatched to the lobby. Yes, as others have stated, their is a lot of construction around the hotel but it's easy to ignore and I felt completely safe walking in the area at all times.

We obtained flight for only \u00a323 each with Easy Jet so equally wanted a cheap hotel. We found this hotel on Expedia for one night free so it cost us only \u00a3109 for three nights (total price). The hotel was huge but this did not mean the service was bad (as with many big hotels). The reception staff were friendly and even though I tried my best German they were all more than happy to speak in English. Our room was lovely. Big double bed, great view, mini bar, trouser press and you could also phone for an iron when ever you needed one. If you have read other peoples comments on the shower and toilet - don't worry its not as bad as people have made out. The shower is literally a glass section in the corner of the room however their is privacy because it is frosted and by the time the hot water gets going your partner or friend can't see you anyway! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. This was our first time to Germany and we are going back in April but this time to Munich, I hope our hotel there is just as good as this one.

I was very disappointed in the area as of November 2005. The building was surrounded on three sides by construction and graffitti were plentiful. Some of the buildings across the street from the hotel looked like housing projects. The area is one of urban blight. Even a city guide book concedes that the square in \"in redevelopment.\" At present, this poorly lit area isn't safe for a single woman. There were few places to go in the evening. The money spent on taxis could have purchased a room at the beautiful Radisson SAS, which is down the street but out of the Park Place square. Brendan was of no help in offering candid information on the area or in arranging for an alternative location. I would not recommend this hotel. The lobby is full of smoke. Moreover, there was only one computer in the \"business center,\" which I had to clean with wet wipes myself.
