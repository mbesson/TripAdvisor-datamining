The room was very cold (around 15 degrees celsius) and the heating in the bathroom did not work at all. So we had to check out the same day and book another hotel, as it was impossible to stay. Besides, the photos and the room itself differs a lot. The furniture is old and broken, the tv does not work etc. The worst thing that they do not give me the refund for the days of the stay. They tell to the booking company (Expedia) that everything was really great and I left for no reason. The impression is that the hotel lives its last days and the main reason is to steal money from the customers. I would not reccomend this hotel to anyone.

The downside was the corridors leading to my room & the room itself where in need of some TLC. The beds where uncomfortable & the pillows where non-existent even for someone who had been drinking all day. I especially couldn\u2019t fathom why a radiator was needed directly under the shower ??

The hotel rooms are of good size and are well kept and clean, however they are a little dated and old. It is very close to all public transport including the underground, bus and taxi rank. Also a short trip away from the main tourist attractions like the Branderburg Gate, the parliament and the tiergarten.

The big plus is its position, just off the Ku Damm and 5 minutes walk from the underground station and the bus stop for the airport. It's not exactly the centre of the social universe but there's a couple of decent pubs nearby (we liked the quiet traditional one on the corner, turn left out of the hotel) and a useful supermarket a few minutes down the road. Using public transport it's quick and easy to get to most places, at least in the old West Berlin. Staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms were quiet, clean and big enough. The only real negative was the breakfast which was awful - mainly (very) processed meat, also they kept running out of everything, including bread and coffee and it was virtually impossible to find a seat. I'd suggest skipping it and going elsewhere. Despite this I'd still give the Quentin an above-average rating, purely because it offers excellent value for money if you're on a tight budget.", "Date": "January 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2249336", "Content": "The hotel is situated in a good location, only one minute walk away from the Kuerfuerstendamm - the best and only place to shop in Berlin ( so I was told by the locals ).
