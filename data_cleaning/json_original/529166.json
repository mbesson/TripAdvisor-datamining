Extremely friendly staff, clean room, powerful A/C, and a varied breakfast that saves both time and money. My spouse and I were recommended this hotel by the Rick Steves book, and we were not disappointed. 10-15 minute walk from Piazza San Marco or the Rialto Bridge, it is located in a legitimate Venice neighbourhood, which lets you get away from the action at the end of the day and see how the locals live. Anyone who had trouble getting there: It was a simple waterbus ride, followed by a 2 minute walk. Granted, it was towards the end of the route, but getting there requires little effort.

My friend and i were only in Venice for one day and night, and were pleased with both the room and the breakfast offerred in the morning on the last day of our stay. In another review i read that it was hard to nativate to this B&B because of the alleyways and canals - that is not Alloggi Barbaria's fault, this is how the Venice city is designed! My friend and i actually had to get off at the San Marco waterbus stop, and a nice waterbus employee navigated us right to the B&B so we wouldn't get lost. We found our way back to the B&B easily with the help of a map given to us by Georgio, the concierge during our stay, who also marked the map for where the Rialto Bridge and other sites were so we could find them easily. Fausto was also very accomodating through the process of booking the room and providing us with transportation details from the airport/train station to the B&B and vice versa. Georgio let us keep our baggage at the B&B during the day before our departure so we wouldn't have to take anything with us.

The breakfast is actually quite nice, you get a yogurt (varies daily!), a coffee/tea, a croissant or a little cake and bread to go with some butter, jam and nutella....if you ask me, that can get you a massive savings in Venice (food in Venice is rather pricey, so Thank you for the breakfast!) I stayed there for 4 nights and the place was easy to find, with a supermarket in close proximity and a 10minute walk to St. Marco's square.

Having stayed, I can now understand why this place gets so many polarised reviews. The room. It is basic, very basic, BUT, it has air-conditioning, a fridge, a comfortable (if a little creaky) bed, a spotlessly clean bathroom, TV, hot water in the shower and a safe. It is not luxurious, nor romantic in any way, but if you want that you are looking in the wrong price bracket for Venice. The only thing it could have benefited from was a kettle. The breakfast. It is basic, very basic, BUT, a couple of bread rolls and cream cheese or jam, a little cake, a yoghurt and tea/coffee are enough to just get you going in the morning. A couple of slices of salami or mortadella would have gone down well, but the breakfast was fine without it. The location. It is off the main tourist strip, in a relatively residential part of town. This has good points and bad points. The bad points are not really that bad, as they are in fact good points in my book, however others may find the fact that it is a whole 15 mins walk from St Marks Square or the Rialto bridge a hardship. I found the fact that it was in the residential area meant that it had quite a few cheap and good quality osteria within a couple of minutes walk, and it was easy to escape the tourist throng walking around. The fact that it is located near the outside of the city means that the transfer from the airport is very easy. Either take the Alilaguna water bus direct from the Airport to Fodamente Nova or Ospedale, or take the airport bus, and then the 52 Vaporetto to Ospedale, and it is a 3 min walk. In conclusion, Allogi Barbaria is the perfect place to stay if you are not fussed about luxury or paying over the odds for a centrally located hotel in Venice and all you want is a place to lay your head after a days walking and taking in the sights. The facilities are similar to a top end hostel but with private, ensuite and clean rooms and a basic breakfast. The fact that it is on the main island is a big plus, avoiding the need to pay for Vaporetto just to get to-and-from the hotel.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cI felt like we were in the state penitentiary!\u201d", "Author": "aj", "ReviewID": "UR118933118", "Content": "Hmm.

Giorgio is not fluent in English, but he does quite well at communicating since he speaks much more English than I do Italian. He was very kind and made sure that any issues we had were addressed, which goes a long way in my book. The hotel is up one flight of stairs from the street and is all on one floor (the rooms, the breakfast area, the terrace) with all of the rooms opening off of the breakfast and kitchen area. The neighborhood is very quiet with little street noise or bells, etc. Our rooms overlooked a pleasant little patio next door. Positives: 1. Not right in the center of the Venice craziness. However, the craziness is less of an issue in January - the city was quite sedate while we were there. However, if acqua alta is a concern, apparently this area is less likely to flood than other more central areas. It took a leisurely 10-15 minutes to reach Piazza San Marco from the hotel. And the hotel is also positioned well to reach Rialto. If you're going to stay farther out from San Marco, I recommend this area since you're just a bit east rather than being farther north or south, which makes reaching the tourist sites more of a hike. 2. Very convenient and easy to find via vaporetto from the train station and then a short walk. This is very nice when you're not yet familiar with the twisty streets of Venice. Also very convenient to go to Murano and Burano from here. 3. Very good service from Giorgio. We had two rooms in the hotel (out of 6, I believe). My room was a comfortable temperature, but my mother's room did not get warm overnight. When it was still a problem the next day, Giorgio called in a service man to tune up the boiler and the temperature problem was fixed. We really appreciated that he worked it out quickly and fixed the problem during our stay. 4. Each room had a mini-fridge stocked with beverage choices at fair prices. We brought home some yogurt and juice to bring on the train with us, and it was nice to have a place to keep food cold overnight. 5. Great price. Negatives: 1. My room had a vague sewage smell coming from the shower drain. It got better if I left the shower stall closed. However, I am odor-sensitive (so it may not have bothered other people; in fact, my mother did not notice it when she was in my room), and it was not a huge problem for me. And I noticed the same odor other places in Venice, so I think it's more of an institutional problem with all the water in the city than a problem with this hotel. 2. The breakfast was rather meager. I had read this in other reviews, but it is true. The only beverage on offer was coffee, with one roll, one packaged croissant, and some butter/jam/cream cheese packets. I am more of a cereal and juice girl, so I got hungry for lunch early. Still, for the price, it's hard to complain too much about this. 3.

On arriving we were greeted and showed straight to our room and given the relevant infomation about breakfast and how to work the remote for the air conditioning, we were also given a map of Venice with the hotel and all the main sights marked. The security is excellent, we were given a key ring with three keys, one for the front door which stays locked 24/7 then one for our room and one for a safe built into the wall in the room (this is free of charge unlike some more expesive hotels). The room was clean and tidy with a good shower and the bed was comfortouble enough, although it was two singles pushed together. There was a mini fridge that got re-stocked every day with water beer and soft drinks. For our entire stay we never saw the cleaner, but every time we returned it was evident they had been and done a good job. The breakfast was a simple affair, fresh warm bread rolls, tea/coffee a pre packed quassiont with a selection of cream cheese, butter and jam. At a first glance the location dosnt seem to hot for all the main sights, but you quickly become aware of how small Venice is. We were about a ten minute walk form St Marks Square and the Rialto Bridge. A 30 second walk out of the door and you are looking accross the water to Murano (where Venician Glass is made) and a furthar five minutes along the front and there are some really nice restaurants with amazing views while you eat. Again just out of the front door and there are three water bus stops which take you direct to and from the airport and the islands of Murano and Burano and also into the heart of Venice. To conclude if you are on a budget or backpacking the Alloggi Barbaria has everything to offer. Clean, comfortable, friendly, good location and at a good price.

We were traveling on a limited budget, which explains our decision to stay here - Venice is very expensive, this place not so much. I've read reviews where people refer to this hotel with superlatives such as the \"Best B&B in Italy\", or even with praise such as \"excellent\", \"lovely\", \"perfect\", \"fabulous\", etc. Frankly, it is none of those. What it is, is a inexpensive, not-terribly located, reasonable place to crash at the end of a long day of walking Venice. This hotel is close to the Ospedale water bus station, and about a 15 minute walk to most of the main points of interest. It is also on a quiet, somewhat dark alleyway, but we didn't feel concerned at all for safety. The truth is that Venice is a fabulous city to walk around in, so the location of the hotel didn't bother us. The room was also very spacious, and had an air conditioner that worked quite nicely. The younger of the two hosts (the gentleman with glasses) was very friendly and welcoming when we arrived, and provided us with maps and walking directions for the city, as well as recommendations on sights of potential interest. The hotel is very close to a supermarket, which is great if you want to save some money on food, or even just pick up a couple of things for a snack. Those are the positives. What was not very nice was the cleanliness (or lack thereof) of the bathroom: the shower had mold growing on it, and it had very clearly been a long time since it had received a proper, thorough cleaning (although I would believe it if you told me that it was rinsed down with water each day when the custodial staff cleaned the room). Our bed was actually two small beds pushed together, and sloped toward the middle. In addition, it was not especially comfortable. Since we were only really using the hotel as a place to sleep and shower, the fact that it disappointed in both of those areas was unfortunate, to say the least. Also problematic was the second half of the \"B&B\": even by the most liberal and inclusive definition, you cannot possible call the offensive display that was placed in front of us each morning breakfast. \"Breakfast\" consisted of one pre-packaged jelly-filled croissant each, a small bowl of crusty, Pillsbury-style rolls, and the worst coffee I have ever been served, anywhere (which was especially disappointing given that we were in Italy). Suffice it to say that we ate a mid-morning shack within 30 minutes of leaving the hotel each day. So, in sum, what you get if you stay here: a cheap room in a not-inconvenient location. What you do not get: a nice room, a clean bathroom, a good breakfast. I would recommend this B&B to two groups: people who are looking for a very cheap, no-frills place to stay in Venice, and people that I don't like very much. We would certainly never stay here again, nor would I sincerely and in good conscience be able to recommend it.

Yes, all the streets in Venice are basically alleys, but this B&B was in a tiny, dark alley. We didn't feel safe. Be prepared to drag your suitcases up 2 flights of stairs from the entrance to the \"front desk\". The guest rooms are situated around the main room where guests checked-in, came in and out, and had breakfast. Although the guests were courteous to keep their voices down, still, if someone just sneezed in the main room, you could hear it in your room. Guests received a set of keys to 1) their room, 2) the front door, and 3) the safe in their rooms which were chained to a heavy anchor. Not smart since the last thing travelers want is to add more weight onto themselves when exploring the city. We never used the safe since we didn't trust that we had the only key to it. We were told that we had to \"slam\" the front door to ensure that it shut, which was another safety concern for us.

Bathrooms were recently renovated with good appliances and fixtures. Hotel is very close to vaporetto stop Ospadale and about 15min. walk (if you know where to go to San Marco). Make sure you buy vaporetto pass, because each ride is 6E. Local food store is just 2 block away, so you could buy some snacks. You may need them because breakfast is not very large. Just a coffee, croussant, lemonade, bread and cream cheese.
