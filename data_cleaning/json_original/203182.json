The room although not huge was fine for our stay.The beds were comfortable with fresh linen provided daily. The only issue with the room was the air conditioning was on a winter setting and blew out warm air. The weather was mild and therefore the room was warm. We had to open the windows and had traffic noise until about 2.30am. The staff were efficient and helpful, although lacked a smile, the exception was. Martin the barman, who was charming and very welcoming. The bus/tram stops just outside the hotel, although because there were three of us we used taxis(metered) which were 10-12 euros to the vatican and the spanish steps. Breakfast was much better than expected, with plenty of hot and cold choices. Had a nice meal at a restaurant across the road and around the corner on the viale Gioacchino Rossini, the Taverna Rossini.

They immediately took our bags and got us checked in and then were able to get us in our room early, so we were able to take a much needed nap before our tour of the Vatican. They were always there to answer questions, call a taxi and one night a gentleman staffer made a wonderful suggestion that we try a local resturant a couple of blocks away and even took the liberty of making us reservations. His suggestion was amazing! The walk over was wonderful and the food at that little place was amazing (I really wish i knew the name of it!) and the female owner was so friendly, kind and suggested amazing foods and wines that complimented the food! I would recommend everybody try this little place if you can figure out the name of it!

The hotel is situated in a great neighbourhood which is well served by good restaurants El Cheppo (I think this is correct) and the Rossini. We dined at both and they were both very good. We also had a meal with room service which was freshly cooked and of good quality. Breakfast at the hotel was very good, fresh fruit, bread, toast, coffee, fruit juice cheese and cold meats; you could not ask for more selection and get a good start to the day. The room were very hot when we stayed and the heating vent only put our warm air, however, that is a personal preference as we prefer it cooler. On arrival the room we were allocated had a leak which meant that the toilet was contantly flushing. The noise was too distracting to sleep. We complained to reception and were immediately moved and the porter helped us with our luggage within five minutes. The beds and pillows were very comfy and we had great nights sleep. The staff were very efficient, helpful and accomodating; even though it was late it appeared as if it was no trouble. Things happen, and it was no drama for us made easier by the helpfulness of the staff. There is an ATM across the road from the hotel which was useful, take care crossing the road as it is busy during the week. The mini bar in the room is very reasonable for bottled water so don't be shy in using this service. There is also a room safe which is useful.

It was well worth the money as they prebooked our tickets for the Colleseum and the Vatican Museum. This avoided the long queues at both venues which allowed us to maximise our time.

Be sure to try a few doors down: Don Vito's Ristorante Siciliano - for a truly authentic gastronomic experience! They'll treat you like royalty! Don't forget Cafe Ingheria at the corner, for some of the best gelato in Roma. We also purchased fabric (a great deal!) from a lovely little upholstery shop across the street from the hotel.

On our first morning we were sat down for breakfast when a couple came in and sat down at a table. Within a minute the couple left the dining area without eating and walked out. After a short while it was noticed that a handbag had been stolen from another guest on the table adjacent to where this couple had sat, so be aware at all times.

I wasn't sure what to expect as I really wasn't able to choose where to stay. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the hotel. I booked a single room and the room was small, but was very clean. There was about 12 inches on either side of the bed. The mattress was very firm, but I could live with it. The bathroom only had a shower and the water changed from hot to cold throughout each shower I took, but it wasn't too bad. The bathroom itself was pretty large, though. It took up about half of the room. It had recently been remodeled and it was beautiful. There was also a balcony, that made the room feel a little larger. The only major complaint that I had was that the free internet computer in the lobby was not working. It was broken the entire week that I stayed there. I kept getting the response that the screen is broken with no other explanations or time frames to be fixed. They did have an internet connection in the room, but it was 8 euros a day and I didn't bring my laptop. There was also a WebTV connection, that I did use. It also cost 8 euros per day, but I paid it because I wanted to check emails. It was terribly slow and frustrating to use. You couldn't see the entire screen and couldn't scroll over, but I suffered through it. I didn't pay for each day that I stayed there. I just used it twice. If that was the worst thing, then I was doing quite well. The elevators of the hotel are also very small. I had one suitcase and it barely fit in the elevator with me. I am not a large person. If you have claustrophobia, take the stairs. Good things were the location. It is in a pretty quiet part of Rome. There are several good restaurants in the area, but some of them are pretty pricey. There is a grocery store across the street. The tram/bus stops are pretty much right outside the door. The front desk even sells one way tram/bus tickets for 1 euro. However, if you are going to be in Rome for more than one day, buy a tourist pass from the tobacco shop around the corner. I think they were 12 euros. You can also get these passes from any metro station. Then you will be able to ride the tram and bus as much as you want for four days. You can get to most of the popular tourist sites using the bus/tram or the metro. It's a little intimidating to to ride the bus or tram at first, they do not announce the stops like they do on the metro. My advice is to ask someone what landmarks to look for before you go so you know when to get off. Or you can do what I did a couple of times and just get on a bus or metro and ride it until it reaches the end of the route and get on another one to see where they go. I got to see a lot of Rome this way and it was pretty cheap. The front desk is very good at giving you this information if you tell them where you want to go. They even have general maps of Rome they will give you if you don't have one. Breakfast is included. It was more than I expected. They have a decent selection of pastries and breads. They usually had several types of canned fruit and a couple of different types of fresh fruit. They also had scrambled and hard-boiled eggs and sausages. They do have a small workout facility and sauna, but I didn't use it. After spending each day walking around Rome in the middle of July, the last thing that I wanted to exercise or sit in a hot room.

It takes about 30 minutes on the bus to get to the city centre and there are only a few scattered restaurants that are nearby to the hotel. Our BAD experience came with the elevator, which I HIGHLY recommend NOT to use. My boyfriend and I were on our way out of the hotel around 8pm. We were on the second floor. The elevator on the left side of the lobby (there are two to choose from) was the first to respond to our call. It was a very small elevator, which fits a maximum of 4 people. We got in and were on our way when the elevator stopped and the buttons failed to work. The doors did not open. We tried the alarm button and did not hear anything. We tried the intercom phone to the front desk and it was not working. We tried to open the doors with our fingers and managed to get the first set open. We tried for the second set and failed. They did not budge. I started to panic as the elevator was small and there seemed to be no safety buttons working. We did the only thing left to do; we pounded on the doors with our fists and screamed at the top of our lungs for 15 MINUTES. Finally 3 kids heard our cried from the fourth floor and found us. We had the doors opened about 2 cm, which was the only air that was circulating. The kids told us that we were stuck between the first and second floor. We asked them if they could go to front desk and get help for us. One of them did and the other two stayed with us. The third kid came running up the steps breathless and informed us \"The front desk lady did not want to come!\" Can you believe it?????? What do you do now? After screaming at the top of our lungs for another fifteen minutes, one of the kids ran outside the hotel and took an Italian policeman by the hand and pulled him into the lobby (he did not speak English and the kids that were helping us were from the US). The policeman came in to speak with front desk. After 30 minutes, we are not sure of all of the exact details but the front desk lady came up to us along with the janitor. The elevator was getting very, very hot; we were dripping from the lack of air and temperature. We were running out of air. They informed us that the elevator technician was on his way. I panicked, as the situation was getting worse. The power went out for a few seconds and it was pitch black. The power went on. After 45 minutes the elevator technician came. At this point I was asking them to cut us out of the elevator, anything to get us out. The technician came and open the doors ad we climbed out of the elevator between two floors. The kids later told us that the elevator had been broken all day, but the hotel did not put a notice on the elevator it was still responding to the call button. Others said the elevator had been acting strange all day. No one from the hotel came to speak to us, or apologized. We saw the manager on our last day, and nothing was said. I must say a huge THANK YOU to the American kids that helped us out. I hope that one day you read this and see how thankful we were to you. You three handled the situation much better then anyone else. You kept us calm and updated us. You ran around for us trying to find help. We tried to thank you in person but I believe that you had already left as we did not see you again. Thank you! The hotel was clean and well kept. The rooms were very nice but the elevator experience was awful. The safety features did not work and the staff did not come to tell us if they even knew we were stuck or that help was on the way for 30 minutes. The situation could have been handled much better. Needless to say that we spent the next 10 days of our vacation taking the stairs at every hotel we stayed at.
