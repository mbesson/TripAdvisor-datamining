We stayed on one of theClub floors which will give you an amazing view, a complimentary all day buffet, snack, wine. And free wifi in the lounge which is great as they charge 50euros a day normally. Breakfast is amazing and very child friendly. They arranged egg hunts etc and made the children feel very welcome. It is very large and slightly corporate but it is well run, lots of nice little detials like flowers etc, the little club on the 1st floor is nice they have a dj on the weekends and it is nice and laid back. We ate at Enoteca and was dissapointed but perhaps it was just us on that perticular night. I also had a great massage in the Six Senses Spa which was great.

From the warm welcome by the bell boys to the check in staff, the restaurant waiters, bar staff, pool staff, room cleaners, nobody could be faulted with their attitude or appearance. All staff appear to be multi lingual and proud of their hotel as well as being very good at anticipating your needs. The rooms are excellent, roomy with superb views, whichever side of the hotel you are allocated, provided with high quality bedding and towels. It is not cheap but it is certainly worth spending these prices for this level of service and comfort. My only small issues would be no free wifi in the rooms which should be an essential these days in a hotel of this class ( you can get 1hour free wifi in the lobby each 24 hours but the lobby is generally busy and not convivial for working on a lap top). All rooms have b and o CD players, which were great 10 years ago, but are old hat now and should be replaced by ipod docks. Lastly there should be English newspapers available, ( Financial times is provided) but all other papers are Spanish whereas the clients seemed to be at least 50 % English speaking when we were there.

Very nice hotel. We were there on Marriott points and were upgraded to a suite which was spacious and lovely. Also included free wifi which was a nice perk.

The partiers are out in full force until 4 - 5 am. We were on the 20th floor and I could still hear their revelry every night when the clubs let out. The service is excellent; at times comical the way they fall all over you to do things like push the elevator button for you! The young men at the entrance are very friendly, pleasant, and helpful when calling a cab and welcoming you when you return. If you don't eat breakfast at the hotel, the next block over has a wonderful place for breakfast/or a late snack. Very reasonable, delicious coffee, and great food.

We were a family of four. It is pricier than we would normally prefer but the deal we got included breakfast each day and the location really can't be beat. The rooms are clean and they brought in an extra bed which meant that my kids each had their own. The bathroom was large and there are lots of fun bathroom amenities. The breakfast was the best I have ever had anywhere. The friendliness of the staff was amazing. Your glass was never empty and one of the chefs would walk around asking you if wanted anything fresh made. The presentation of the food was fabulous and on the fresh made churros and chocolate plate that they would bring to your table, there was often a written message in chocolate, like welcome, or hasta luego. I cannot say enough about the staff who always smiled, always helped out, and always went that extra bit to make sure you didn't need anything. The only negative I can say about the hotel is their charge for the internet which I believe should at least be free in the lobby. It's a hefty charge and for the amount you are paying already, seems a bit excessive. I would avoid the restaurants along the harbor for meals. The concierge will recommend you eat here.

After reading reviews here and looking at the benefits offered through American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts we chose to stay on the Club Level and arrive to this hotel. (late check out / \u20ac85 voucher). We arrived around 10am from the airport and after approaching the check in desk on the 1st floor (2nd in US) were escorted to an elevator bank up to the 33rd floor where we were welcomed by name, given beverages, and quickly checked into our room that was waiting for us. The room was nice - furniture starting to wear but nice - B&O TV unfortunately burned in with artifacts from welcome message being repeatedly displayed. Bedding great and comfortable. The views were wonderful - larger rooms face NW and SE - normal rooms Dave NE and SW - I think SW beach view is nicer - we had NE view of adjacent office tower next door with marina. The location of this hotel is near the beach but far from most things people come here to see. The metro is easily accessed a few blocks away and cabs are plentiful - but it is a good long walk to the gothic quarter which is why we stayed in multiple hotels (this one, 1898, & W). You can look up the road and see the Segrada Familia on axis with the Cassandra de la Marina. The thing we most loved about this hotel was the service and the staff in the Club Lounge. Really nice spreads of food for breakfast, lunch, and evening snacks (really could call it a buffet of appetizers which combined make a meal) - you could eat all of your meals here and never get board with it - and the food along with drinks were all included as part of the club level. The staff were always friendly and talkative as well as helpful and always willing to answer questions about the city or help get tickets. We especially recall Michal who brought us decaf Capachinos, Sonia who helped us get tickets, Madhu who checked us in and out and answered questions and Raluca who always made sure we had all we needed to eat or drink - but everyone we interacted with was wonderful. We used our voucher to eat at one of the hotels restaurants: Enoteca - the food was interesting and good - but pricey - the voucher offset the cost 40% or so for the two of us. We very much liked our Server Dani who went out of her way to explain things and answer our questions and still manage to provide the same great service we were given to her other tables. We also used the electric smart car which was free to use in increments of time (I think 4 hours) to guests staying in the Club Levels. We regret we did not make it to the spa, and we very much missed the club level with its food and beverage after moving onto our next hotel. We checked out at 4pm but hope to return soon. It was the most welcoming hotel of our stay and fit perfectly as the first hotel to recover from the flight in and take an easy first few days. We will go back and likely explore other Ritz Carlton's based in tis experience.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAttention to detail and Guests\u201d", "Author": "jewelofmontreal", "ReviewID": "UR125042247", "Content": "Though I was staying at the Hotel Arts for work.

Located on the rebuilt and revitalized beachfront, Hotel Arts is next to an arcade of casual restaurants and a wide esplanade where you can walk or bike along the water. There are nicer beachfront restaurants between the hotel and the beach as well as an open air night club or two. Directly across from the entrance to the hotel is a small casino. The hotel itself is lovely- an elevator takes you up to the lobby, which has a very nice lounge with complimentary candy and green apples. The elaborate flower decorations seemed to change daily and were a nice touch. Another set of elevators go to the rooms themselves. We used the hotel's car service, which picked us up(my husband, myself, our 2 year old, and my parents) promptly at the airport, but we had to endure a 50 minute traffic filled ride to the hotel. Upon arriving, we were greeted and told that our rooms were not ready, which was disappointing as the hotel had all of our travel info and we had actually arrived late because of the traffic. We had booked 2 adjoining rooms and were happy to be upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment because due to a pharmaceutical conference, there was a demand for single rooms. This made our wait much more tolerable! The apartments are on a floor with a dedicated concierge, who was more than helpful in accomodating our needs. Our duplex apartment had an incredible view of te water through 2 story windows, a small galley kitchen and two ensuite bedrooms upstairs. It is the perfect setup for families and if it is within your budget, I would highly recommend! Service was Ritz quality. A baby cot was in place and a large coffee table removed promptly when requested. As for amenities, the restaurants and food were overpriced but as expected in a hotel. There are plenty of food options just outside the hotel, which was convenient. Wifi charges were ludicrous but alas, expected. Given the hotel's size and location, I would have expected a larger swimming pool/bar area and a shallow pool for kids, but the existing one was fairly nice. However, the pool was not heated and far too cold, so we spent time in the jacuzzi instead. Bottom line, this is a luxurious and comfortable hotel for families and for those who are not adamant about staying in the city center or who have been to Barcelona before and are content with less local charm. For families, there is plenty of room and food options and the nearby beach to entertain. I would advise anyone that although the local area looks pristine, be aware of pickpocketers and thieves.

We'd stayed here 8 years ago but hadn't been back because it is so expensive. While it's still not cheap it seemed better value than on our previous visit. We had a slightly shaky start as we arrived late at nght and had a little difficulty checking in because there were men working on ladders at the desk, and then we had to phone down to chase up our luggage which should have been quicker. Everything else was great. Our room was on the 21st floor and had a great view over the Olympic Port out to sea. The room as lovely with a good sound system and TV and a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was the best ever with twin sinks a full bath, and separate shower and toilet each with a door. The shower was brilliant. We overslept because the room was so quiet and the blinds were so good at keeping out the light. Our room rate included breakfast which was excellent. Service was friendly and efficient with staff circulating with fresh orange juice ( best ever ) and coffee. There was a really good selection of items laid out over a number of counters along with a hot food area. The public areas are beautiful with lovely flowers and candles. One slight negative was that there were a number of items laid out on the table in the room which looked as thought they were free but weren't. At least when everything is in the mini bar you know not to take them. There was a bottle of still water left beside the bed which was free but the sparkling water and everything else was chargeable. There was no tea making facility and the coffee was 4 euros a cup which is a bit steep on top of the room rate. While it is a very luxurious place there were a few signs of wear and tear which you wouldn't expect at 5 stars. A lot of woodwork was chipped and there was a water stain on our wall. The basket work on one of the dining chairs was broken and the gold thread trim on our blanket was frayed. Small things but detracts from the 5 star experience a little. We have always liked the area around the hotel as there are a number of bars and restaurants in the Olympic Port . However time has not been kind and the area is now quite scruffy and down at heel. The bars looked unpleasant and the restaurants were very touristy. The receptionist looked aghast when we said we would be going there and pointed us to Barceloneta which is much nicer. The beach area near the hotel is nice in daytime and in good weather as there are a number of nice places to eat just above the beaches in both directions. Just be careful at night as we were nearly robbed in that area a couple of years ago.

The apartment was large but had only beds for max 4 people, but the staff added a couple of rollaway beds in a hurry. The apartment stretches from one side to another of the building and there's a view of the ocean, beaches, downtown and all the way up to the mountains behind the city. It's the best view I've had from a hotel room. Ever. The staff at the hotel are friendly and give excellent service. The concierge on the 34th floor was always available and always friendly. Another great thing about booking an executive floor room is that you have free access to the executive club. I think it's on the 33rd floor. They offer great food and drinks several times a day and we often started the evening with a glass of champagne there before going to some restaurant. They also have a good gym and a pool, although the pool area can be quite crowded on warm days. But the beach is only a block away.

Communicating via e-mail with the property direct was hopeless, as they failed to respond twice to my inquiries. Calling for a rate quote yielded as many varied rates as number of calls. Finally booked through a corporate partnership rate which was considerably better than their rack rate posted on the web site. It's a luxury hotel, no doubt, with high end amenities, crisp service, and remarkable views if you're high enough up and face the Marina. Sampled room service twice, both times exemplary fare delivered as assured. As mentioned ofter in reviews of this hotel, the pool is abysmal for the size of the Arts. \"Saving\" chairs is ticklish business at many upscale hotels, with little or no enforcement of the policies. Listen, I have no problem with any policy, as long as it's made public and that it's consistently enforced. Free for all with no rules? Fine. We'll arm wrestle for a lounger. Grease a pool kids palm to have him reserve your spot? Can do. Make saving space a room charge? OK. But do what you say you'll do. Causes less dissension among the ranks, although there is no perfect solution when there are far too many guests for pool furniture.

Very European and modern, wonderful views. We had a roll away put in the living room for our adult daughter and she was quite comfortable on it. Main bedroom bed was very comfortable as well. Internet access in the room was easy and fast. Only complaint with the room was the televisions. Supposed to be able to buy movies to view but the service wouldn't work on either TV. Someone came up to try and show us what to do but they couldn't get it working either. No big deal but since we don't speak Spanish, it would have been nice to be able to watch some movies at night in English. There was also a radio/sound system but we couldn't find any instructions in how to work it. Only had one meal in hotel, lunch in Bites. Was extremely overpriced for what we had and food was less than good. Husband had some sort of fish special and there were four large bones in it which shouldn't have been there. Daughter had a club sandwich which had a fishy taste to it and I had a chicken caesar and the lettuce was really brown all along the edges. It shouldn't have been served. Then had two sodas and I think a tomato juice and it was 97 Euros. Crazy. We spoke to a couple staying there who had dinner the night before in the hotel and they also weren't impressed with the food and thought it was very over priced. I know hotel meals are generally higher than elsewhere, but the food should at least be good. Really liked the area where the hotel was located. Right across from the Port Olimpic area where there were the usual tourist junk shops and a nice area with loads of restaurants. We did find one of the shops on the closest side to our hotel had lots of snacks, bottled water, sodas and other misc food items which was handy. We also found on our last morning that there was a nice cafe just around the side of the hotel by the casino where we had a nice breakfast sitting outside. A good find. There is also a hop-on-hop off stop just outside the hotel which is good if you plan to use that to get around and see the city. Plenty of taxis available just outside the hotel. Never had to wait. I must say since we've been home the hotel has contacted us re the comments we made on the comment card and I do appreciate this.

Gave this hotel 5 stars as we stayed here 4 nights during La Merce and had a great stay. We arrived in the early morning and our club level room was ready and waiting for us. Our room was partial city view and partial ocean view. Quite nice. Staff in the lobby and in the club level were very friendly and courteous. The room itself was modern and roomy, with many added comforts. The beds were comfortable. The bathrooms were very large with 2 sinks, separate tub, shower and toilet areas. The multiple shower heads were an added bonus. The towels were lush and oversized; the hairdryer a powerful one, not like the pitiful ones you may find in European hotels that barely blow. Turn down service every night. It was my husband's birthday weekend, so twice the staff gave us birthday treats: chocolate mousse cake and then chocolate strawberries and cava. Nice, personal touch. The Club level was adequate. It just didn't meet our expectations. We found the food to be sub-par to the food you may find at Ritz Carlton club levels in the US. We love European wines; however, we were disappointed in their wine choices here on the club level. All this said, we enjoyed the comfort of having the club level to relax and refresh. The pool was beautiful and the staff here was also courteous. We did have lunch at the pool one day. For an 18 euro caesar salad, I would have expected to not have brown lettuce. A disappointment. We did go down to the beach in front of the hotel and rented chairs for a couple of hours. Not enjoyable at all! Stay away. The beach itself was beautiful and the water gorgeous. However, the plethora of \"beach attendants,\" I guess you would call them (not affiliated with the hotel), constantly walking back and forth calling out \"Beer, coca cola, cold water\" was absolutely unnerving. Then on top of that, you had the Asian ladies (again, a good number of them) asking you multiple times \"mess-ah-hee (massage)? I give you good price.\" Couldn't take it! Went back up to the pool!

We explained we liked a room with a nice view so we were offered one with a view of the beach and harbour on the 24th floor so long as we didn't mind waiting a short while so that the room could be prepared. It wasn't just the reception staff who were helpful though. All the staff did their best to ensure our stay was the best possible, and the hotel has alot of staff to look after the guests. A bit of a headcount round the pool area alone showed about 10 staff looking after guests round the pool and a further 5 top class chefs working an outside restaurant. A special thanks must go to Yamn Roche the poolside manager who took the trouble to come and speak to us several times a day and remembered our names throughout. We were totally pampered throughout our stay and whilst the hotel is one of the more expensive hotels in the city it really was well worth paying the extra for. The hotel itself is beautiful with spaceous bedrooms all kitted out with no expense spared. It is located right by the beach next to the Olympic Marina and well within walking distance of the main harbour, La Rambla and the old Gothic area of the city. If it falls within your budget you will love The Arts Hotel.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel and excellent staff\u201d", "Author": "pchang637", "ReviewID": "UR116893122", "Content": "As many other reviews have mentioned, this is a beautiful hotel. The lobby, hallways, etc. are all simply and elegantly decorated. Right when you walk into the lobby, there is staff waiting to help answer any questions you may have. The concierge was also very helpful in making dinner recommendations, as well as assisting us with rental car issues. The room we stayed in had a view of the city. The room itself had all the amenities of a 5-star hotel (high-end bath products, large walk-in shower, big bathtub, various lighting settings, etc.). My only complaint with the amenities available in the room was the fact that EACH coffee pod (for the single-serving espresso machine available in the room) was 4 euro. I felt that was a bit steep for espresso you make yourself, when many hotels will offer free coffee packets (granted, not espresso) in the guest rooms. The pool was on the smaller side, but the staff servicing the area was attentive. They helped lay out towels on the lounge chairs, and brought out the wine that we ordered with complimentary bottles of water. The location of the hotel was nice in that it was right along the beach, where there were a ton of great restaurants and people watching. There is also a casino right next to the hotel. We did have to take a taxi into the city in order to check out more of the touristy sites, but taxis weren't that expensive. All in all, a great hotel. I was lucky to be able to get a corporate discount rate (which included free internet access), so while our stay was pricey, I didn't pay full market rate. I would probably hesitate to stay here if I had to pay full market rate, given a tourist might still have spend a little more money for taxis to the tourist destinations.

I have a few minor complaints which I will list only for the sake of helping others, but I will say that they were very minor and they will not deter me from staying here again. In fact, I plan and hope to return to Barcelona and the hotel arts very soon. 1) there is a charge for the internet (25 euros) a day... In my opinion when you are staying at a 5 star hotel you should not have to pay for internet. It is a small thing that can make a big difference 2) the cleaning service could have been better. there were no real problems with the housekeeping, I just think that for such a nice hotel it could have been up to par with comparable hotels.

True, you're not on the busy streets of Las Ramblas or Passieg de Gracia but to me that was a plus. The hotel is a short walk from the train station. You can jump on a train and be in all the right places in a few short minutes. There are restaurants all along the beachfront or you can walk to nearby Barceloneta. Along the beach they have these xiringuitos or open air restaurants where you can enjoy a drink or a snack if you don't want something more formal. Within close proximity of the hotel, there are delis where you can get decent food at a reasonable price. That's what we did for breakfast everyday. The hotel gym had excellent equipment.

We arrived quite late in the evening (past 11pm) on a Friday and stayed till Monday. I had booked one of the hotels 3 night offers where we were to reveive a hotel credit to be spent at the hotel during the stay (about 150 EURs per room per stay), which was confirmed at check in, that this could be spent at the restaurants and bar and would be deducted at check-out. The negatives: Check-in was unbelievably slow, 20mins+ eventhough there were 3 ladies checking us into the 2 rooms. The Spanish clich\u00e9 of taking their time with things was not applicable since the staff were from all over Europe but not Spain. We had 2 very nice rooms with fantastic views of Barcelona, and the beach, facing south. When entering the room my friends discovered a naked man in their room. To make a long story short, the ladies at check-in had made a mistake with the room and they got another room 2 floor down. Other than an embarrassed lady at check-in who apologised, no apologies about the incident were made. Unusual for this Hotel category. On check-out, we had to ask for the deduction mentioned earlier for the promotion booked, preliminary bill had someone elses dinner and no deduction on it. We then discovered that alcoholic beverages can not be deducted with this offer. So we ended up with most of the credit left over and quite a large bill from the bar. (cocktails are EUR 18). The alcoholic beverage clause being exempt from the offer must have been in the small print I assume I failed to read somewhere when booking, but it was certainly not pointed out to either of us at check-in, which would have been the way to go, and we would have spent the credit on food instead. Almost 300 EUR down the drain. Again, something I wouldn\u2019t expect in a Hotel in this category. WIFI should be free in today\u2019s times! The positives: The Hotel is really nice, great lobby, with very attentive service, great bar. Great food in the restaurants, also with great service, although we didn\u2019t try the Michelin star restaurant (also in the Hotel). The concierge was very helpful. Staff throughout the Hotel were generally very welcoming and friendly. The rooms were very nice, with great views over Barcelona, the beach, ocean etc. They are spacious in a modern style. Beds are very comfortable! Great large gym, and again attentive staff. Housekeeping, was very forthcoming. We had been in the room one evening and turndown service wasn\u2019t done as usual, we came home late and asked for some waters and coffee capsule refill. Housekeeping came immediately to stock us up. Definitely the most service oriented house-keeping I have experienced for a while! Location is great.

A friend and I stayed for a four day holiday weekend. We had booked club level with a special deal (3 nights for the price of two). Our initial impressions were not great: the check-in at the club reception was rushed to say the least. The club area is on the small side and therefore busy. But things got better when we got to the room which was spacious and nice and well equipped, although it would be nice to have at least one english television channel that is not a news channel. The view from our room (and the club level) was fantastic! After a night out, we went to the club for breakfast which was supposed to be open until 11.30am. We arrived around 11.00am but already at 11.15am we were told they would be closing the buffet so we needed to hurry if we wanted more food - and true to their word, all food was gone by 11.30am. My friend has a gluten-intolerance which we had reported before arrival and reconfirmed upon checking-in but it still took the kitchen 20 -25 mins to get her a piece of bread by which time the buffet had closed. So much for a relaxed breakfast. The early closing of the buffet service seemed to be standard practice. In addition, we often found the club buffets half-empty and we constantly had to ask for plates and cutlery. Admittedly, staff were very friendly and helpful in getting any items you asked for but I would expect a Ritz Carlton hotel to have their logistics under control without guests having to prompt staff. The fact that most staff seemed summer-interns might explain some of their inexperience? When we got back to the room, we turned on the privacy light but that did not stop hotel staff from entering the room without ringing the door bell or knocking on the door! This happened to us twice in the four days we stayed at the hotel. On one of our days, we decided to spend a bit of time at the pool. Thank god my friend got there early because there were only two lounge chairs left... The pool is tiny for the size of the hotel (many guests made the same comment) and clearly not enough space is available around the pool for guests. Also, the water in the pool is cold, and I mean cold, even though it was nice and warm outside. The food served at the pool and in the hotel restaurants is ok but not great and very expensive so I would recommend going out for tapas or a meal rather than eating in the the hotel. There are plenty of places in the city with great food. Despite the above issues, we did enjoy staying at the hotel but only because we managed to get a deal.

My room was in the corner of the building, so it was larger than usual with double windows for view. The toiletries were furnished by Acqua di Parma which was great, but for extra soaps they only gave us Neutrogena (??). My two complaints for this hotel are: 1. The body shower (not rainshower) just doesn't work. They shoot off waters from all directions, and on my first night the cold water was not working at all, had to wait till morning for them to come and fix it. This was a common problem encountered by my family who was also staying at the hotel. 2. My family and my rooms were all charged with extra stuff that we didn't purchase/take: umbrellas, mini bar. But after a complaint, they managed to void the charges.

Since we were a family with 4 children ages 3-11, we needed our rooms very close together or adjoining! They said they would not have any available so they would like to upgrade us to an apartment at no extra charge! This apartment was truly amazing and much bigger than a regular hotel room! I can't stress enough how nice it was to be able to go to the club lounge for drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and food whenever we wanted! Even with the increased cost of a club room I'm sure this saved us a large amount of money because with having 4 kids who are always wanting soft drinks and snacks we would have been spending a lot more! Most clubs I've experienced in the past have only been open a few hours here and there! Their club lounge was open at 630am until 11pm every day and always had food and drinks available!! The service of everyone at the hotel was perfect! The 1 tour that they scheduled for us to Montserrat was exceptional. They conveniently allowed us to charge it to our room and they took care of paying him! It was an amazing tour that I'm so glad we experienced it! We were considering canceling it but thank God we didn't because we would have missed out on something big!!! Overall, I can't say enough about this hotel!

I think that they had just taken on a lot of new personel as I saw some being guided around the hotel. The room was very nice but, although we asked for a quiet room it was opposite a hospital where the ambulances go in and out day and night making a lot of noise and also on a very busy road (easily heard although we were on the 17th floor). We got another room on the 20th floor but it only helped with the noise from the road, we could still hear the syrens. Great breakfast and lots of personel to serve it, we felt really spoilt. We chose this hotel because of the sauna but.... you have to pay 40Euros a person so we didn't go. It seems that there are separate saunas for men and women in some dressing rooms but that is not our idea of fun. So.... we ended up paying a lot of money for a hotel not getting what we were after. A piece of advice... you don't need to eat in the hotel as there are hundreds of restaurants in the area and you can even walk to down town Barcelona. A minor remark, why do double rooms often only have the light switches on one side? One of the person has control of the lights but if that person is already asleep the other one has to get up and go to the other side of the bed to switch lights on and off.

We booked a club room which I don't think is very well described on the website. It was wonderful. What a view from the 33rd floor and to have such friendly help from the staff was incredible. Lovely food and great drink. The weather was awful on the Saturday and the staff were so helpful with recommendations of places to go. Nothing was too much trouble. They made our stay so special. Some reports have said that the hotel is too far from the centre of Barcelona. Of course it isn't in the centre because it is by the sea. However, there are plenty of taxis outside the door and the tour bus stops seconds away. I shall try and keep this write-up brief but basically the hotel was superb. The staff were superb and the food and drink were amazing. I have stayed in many, many top hotels but this one by far out ranks anywhere I have ever stayed. The staff in the club lounge were just lovely. Julien, Desiree and Jennifer made our stay just perfect and I hope they read this report.

So, we were very excited to stay here during July 2010. First, a note about the weather. It is very hot in Barca in July, and it was exceptionally hot during our week here (90+ degrees F most days). The only problem with this is that the hotel's HVAC system seems to be very outdated, at least in our rooms. Our apartment (more about this later) was very hot, and we could never get the A/C to get it cooled down. We ended up keeping the blinds closed all day (when we were out in town anyway) to help keep the heat down. The staff brought us two fans to keep the air moving, which helped us sleep at night. I know Americans are accustomed to more A/C than Europeans, but we expected better cooling for this class of hotel (especially at night when trying to sleep), and this is really my only complaint about the hotel. We were upgraded to a two-bedroom apartment by the very accomodating staff when it took a very long time for our two rooms to be cleaned and ready upon check in. We were patiently waiting in the lounge when we were advised that the staff wanted to upgrade us. The apartment was fabulous, and it was like our own private penthouse above Barcelona. We were on the 40th floor and had unbelievable views of the sea and city, particularly at night. We were there the night Spain won the World Cup, and we watched the fireworks all night long. Being on the 40th floor helped muffle the horns that honked all night long.... The staff, what can I say about the staff in the apartments. They were the most attentive, service-oriented staff I have ever experienced. They went out of their way to make our 4-year-old daughter's stay special, bringing her candies and coloring books, etc. I cannot say enough about the staff of the apartments. They are top flight, which is what you expect from Ritz Carlton. The same is true about the staff at the front desk and housekeeping. As far as location, there is a metro stop a couple of blocks away, and getting a taxi is very easy. Barcelona is a great walking town. If you need \"supplies,\" there is a mall, which includes a grocery store, a few blocks away in the former Olympic village (ask the staff, but it is about 4 blocks to the east). We found it handy to stock our apartment's kitchen with food and drink for our weeklong stay. Hotel drinks are a bit pricey. The kids enjoyed the pool, but it got a bit crowded during the middle of the afternoon. Early in the morning and late at night we had it to ourselves. Barcelona is a wonderful city to explore.

That is the first bad point: the check in services are too tiny for such a big hotel so everything looks like a mess. We got into the room after one hour waiting and because we asked (we werent called on our cells as promised). The luggage took another 1/2 hour and because we complained!!! We had booked a romantic package but the promised items to be delivered upon arrival (bottle of wine etc) weren't there so I had to call again! Another point: staff was constantly knocking on the door trying to deliver things we hadn't ordered! Very annoying for a 5 star hotel and such an expensive one. Arola restaurant was quite nice! Breakfast was delicious! When paying I was shocked to see the price charged for bar items (which were laying on the desk , diddn't have a price on so one doesn't know if they are free of charge or not and if not how much they are)! Otherwise lovely hotel (we didn't use the spa). Please to charge this price: upgrade your checkin service (staff could show the premises, offer something to drink in case of waiting etc!!!), modernise some items that need to be changed (for instance parassols need to be changed), add a pricelist next to the items in the room (water, chocolate bars etc), upgrade the roomservice (the day we were leaving the cleaning lady wanted to come in and clean at 10!!!! So she wasn't even informed that we were leaving (and we had the right to a late checkout).", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellinzona-Svizzera", "Title": "\u201cArts hotel: a dream hotel\u201d", "Author": "leilataminelli", "ReviewID": "UR78363383", "Content": "The hotel is very very beautiful, modern with all the services you need.

It was a last minute decision to go to Barcelona, but we liked the idea of going to a city with a beach to mix up the sightseeing with relaxing by the pool, so the Arts Hotel was the ideal choice. We booked a Club level room, which meant that not only did we have an amazing view from the 30th floor, but we also had access to the Club lounge, which resulted in a very relaxing check in with a glass of champagne. The room was lovely, with a gorgeous bathroom and free Nespresso machine! The club lounge is excellent - the breakfast buffet is great, and on Sundays there is a chef making omelettes. There are various other food \"presentations\" throughout the day, so there's always something to eat if you're feeling peckish, including afternoon tea with gorgeous little cakes. All alcohol is included, so basically you have Laurent Perrier on tap all day long, which results in the club level being VERY good value. Service here was excellent, the staff would always come and ask if you wanted a refill even though it is theoretically \"self-service\". The pool is lovely, although it is rather small and as there were quite a few kids around it was a bit noisy. The staff around the pool are very attentive, and kept bringing fresh fruit skewers and little glasses of sorbet, yummy! The location of the hotel is excellent. While its not right in the centre of town, you can walk to many of the sights, and getting cabs is no problem, there's a constant supply of them at the entrance. It's also really nice being right on the beach, as there are lots of nice beachside restaurants. We ate in Arola one evening, and it was truly excellent, fantastic food, wine and service - highly recommended. The only issue with the hotel really is that some of the restaurants aren't open every day. Obviously you're in a big city so you'll definitely be able to find somewhere to eat, but it seems odd that in such a big hotel, the restaurants wouldn't be open every day. Only downside was we were considering visiting the spa, but the price of treatments was outrageous (compared to London) so we didn't bother.

Despite hearing brilliant things about the W, we wanted somewhere a little rough round the edges, perhaps not so new and modern and sparkly!! Somewhere with a bit of character - hence we chose the Arts. The hotel was fantastic - just as i was hoping for. We were upgraded to a large corner room on the 17th floor, with amazing sea views - you felt like you were floating! Pure heaven. Room was spectacular - large and spacious, well decorated, clean and tidy. The hotel had booked us a restaurant for dinner at nearby Terra d'alta mar - which is essentially a very high up restaurant which you access by elevator - with excellent views across the city and bay. I had asked for something special and romantic, which perhaps Barcelona is not best known for - but this was certainly something! We had booked too late to get a table by the window, but settled for a table in the middle of the restaurant. It was pretty romantic, but would have been greatly enhanced by candlelight! Service was iffy, but who cares if youre having a good time. The food was amazing! Not cheap though! Thankfully my offer to pay was rejected! :) When we got back to the hotel a wedding was in full swing on the extensive grounds, and we sat by the bar absorbing the atmosphere and music, sipping cocktails in the balmy evening. (Must point out - excellent wedding venue! Def worth exploring!) Sunday was spent lounging by the pool back at the Arts hotel. Thankfully our hotel room afforded us an excellent view of the pool, so we could spy the deckchairs filling up and knew when to make a mad dash for it!! We reserved our chairs with sunblock and magazine, and then headed to the indoor Bites restaurant for breakfast - scrambled eggs with truffles, yum yum! Then quickly to the pool! I have to point out the pool was chock full off families and little kids running around. Quite sweet really, i didnt mind much. If you are hoping to avoid families then i would avoid this hotel, or at least the pool area in the heat of summer! Had lunch at restaurant next to pool - most amazing grilled tuna we have EVER had. I am still dreaming of it!!!! For our last dinner we had to try the acclaimed michelin starred restautant in the hotel, which name now escapes me (arollo?) anyhow, it was brilliant. we had the tapas tasting menu which was very reasonable at about \u20ac49 pp. (that was the price of a main course alone the night before!!!) great service, good bottle of wine, we were very happy. afterwards retired to the balcony for a drink and cuddled up in the sofa chairs while the DJ played love songs. it was if time had stopped.

Service was iffy too: housekeeping managed to take away my robe and towels without replacing them for nearly 4 hours despite requests; the concierge managed to transfer me around 4 people and then hang up on me when chasing this. And in the bathroom, while there was a very good selection of things like combs, cotton buds etc, the toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, shower gel etc) were extremely low-rent: the conditioner was easily the worst I've ever used and left my hair feeling dreadful.

We found the location wonderful for a summer vacation, located with the city on one side of the hotel and the water on the other side. Since we live in a large city with a large body of water we felt right at home. The area seemed safe with only minor reports of pick pockets around the boardwalk outside the hotel. If your looking to see the city the hop on off bus tour was right outside the hotel with a Metro Station one block away. If going out for dinner, options abound right around the hotel on the waterfront. The beaches outside the hotel were nice but if your sensitive to topless sunbathing you may want to take a pass. The only negative about the beach is the constant drove of people trying to sell you water, beer, soda ect. The hotel itself was extreamly nice however if your a budget traveler this may not be the best value, breakfast alone was 32 euro's per person but a short walk down the street found more cost effective options. Upon checking into our room we found the views breathtaking, the bed extreamly comfortable, the bathroom heavenly and large windows providing great light. So here's my only problem with our stay, after going out the first night we came back to our room sometime around two in the morning and the noise coming from outside made it difficult for me to sleep. Since we faced the water (remember our great views) along with many wonderful night clubs the bass beat right through the walls. At first I called the front desk thinking it was someone on our floor but once security came up it turned out to be right outside our windows. We live right downtown Chicago, but we don't have night club's open until six in the morning outside our door. If the cost is not a problem I would recomend this hotel for the active traveler.

Until you learn this, the place is confusing. There is also a separate elevator from these two mentioned to get to the fitness center and pool. Odd really. Someone did help us find the room once we asked. The room was to die for. Big, luxurious, spa bathroom- beautiful really. Had there not been so much to do outside of the hotel, I could have stayed in the room for a week! The staff comes in twice daily and leaves on music, replaces towels and remakes the bed. That was a really nice feature. We felt very comfortable there. The fitness center appears find at a first glance but then when you go to use it, you realize it lacked proper air conditioning, that the cool ipad touch screens for the treadmills really don't work or need to be recalibrated and that you can't really find towels to wipe your forehead anywhere. There was water provided there in bottles which was nice. It was a fine workout facility but certainly not the best I had been in. The pool had the best chairs and huge, fluffy towels. When you take the elevator to the pool, you feel like you have taken the wrong entrance as you enter through this back, undecorated, very service-feeling area. Very odd. Also, it was clear that this pool was not big enough for the amount of guests that it needs to accommodate. On our first day, the pool had each chair full and was quite and peaceful. On the weekend, it became a Disney World theme park. The pool was full of people and there was a waiting list to get chairs! They did come around daily with samples of smoothie drinks and with fruit skewers for no charge which was nice. But, had I been on a waiting list for the pool, I would not have been too happy. They clearly couldn't accommodate the number of people they had staying at the hotel. There was an area off to the side of the pool that had nice hammocks and a 'hot tub' or more like a smaller pool. It looked like a good place to rest while you awaited your room after a long flight. We did not eat at this hotel because it was WAY to expensive. 35\u20ac hamburgers in one restaurant! The pool grill seemed a little better with 20\u20ac pizzas and such but still expensive. And don't dare eat anything from the minibar in the room- 7\u20ac chocolate bars and water, 6\u20ac coke etc. There was free one hour per day internet usage in the lobby only. You could pay more for access in your room. The one hour was easy to access and suit us just fine. The lobby, although quite noisy at night, was comfortable.

My own experience started upon check in. I requested an early check in and arrived at 11. The room was not yet ready. Fair enough, if they were full. The lobby itself was like a railway station, with hundreds of people milling around. It hardly felt like luxury. I gave in my bags and went for a drink, having been told I would be called when the room was ready. At that point I first experienced the hotel\u2019s incredible appetite for extortionate charges. Beers (not very large) were about 10EUR each. After 3 hours and no call, I went back to the desk, or at least tried as the queues were long. A helpful attendant asked if she could help and eventually came back with a key for me. Apparently my bags would follow me to my room. No one showed me to my room though (a usual \u201cworld class hotel\u201d feature). An hour later no bags, so I called. My bags would be with me shortly, apparently. 15 minutes later, one bag showed up, but one missing. The second bag's existance was news to the bellboy.

Luckily I did not help myself to any of the minibar items on display, as a 250ml bottle of water was 7EUR. Even the coffee in the room was 4 EUR, which is free in most hotels. Internet access for one day was 25EUR (although they would do a month for 475!). Breakfast downstairs was 30. The hotel itself was nice but hardly word class. An event arranged by the hotel for our conference was utterly chaotic, and involved the entire conference eating dinner at 1030 pm, clearly because the hotel had forgotten to arrange it (this was an event for 150 people!). The staff were often helpful, but seemed to think that they were running a world class hotel. At best this could be described as an average 5 star hotel with prices much higher than that.

One of our party commented that the reception was like a cattle market and that was pretty accurate. There definitely seemed to be a pile 'em high culture which I guess is what comes with having 30+ floors of rooms to fill. Queues of scruffy looking package tours filled the first floor lobby area which was so small - who, gallingly, had probably paid only half the rate we had. The room itself was scruffy - probably a function of fitting so many said guests into the rooms - there were cigarette burns in the carpet and it didn\u2019t look like it has probably been refurbished since the hotel was put up - and in general the room didn\u2019t feel especially clean. Bits of the veneer on the furniture were chipped to reveal chipboard underneath. The general effect was fine - and as you would expect a five star business hotel to be, but on closer examination the fa\u00e7ade was slipping and the room was due a decent clean and refurb, less ritz carlton more novotel. Definitely not what you would expect\u2026 To be honest these are all minor details but perhaps the most disappointing part of the stay was the reprihensibly bad service. On arriving we were informed that the room we booked ( 2 queen sized beds, as stipulated in an email at time of booking) wasn\u2019t available and that we would have tostay in a room with a king size bed and a child's stow-away bed (and be moved into a room with 2 queen size beds the next day). That\u2019s not exactly how I envisaged spending the first night of my holiday so we complained, apparently, according to the duty manager on reception the hotel was \"Totally full\" and there was nothing that could be done, only when we pushed the matter did a standard room with 2 queen size beds become magically available. I would rather that they didn\u2019t lie about there being none available as an attempt to fob us off, and then sort the matter out when we became increasingly frustrated about the experience. Given we had to wait for an hour for this to become available we went to the champagne bar - I know hotels charge extortionate prices for drinks but EUR 20 for a gin and tonic just took away a lot of enjoyment from having said drink - especially when we were presented with a bill for the best part of EUR 150 2 drinks each (3 of us in the group) later. Perhaps the bill would be ok if the service was stupendously good but having waited 20 mins at the table to be served we then went into the (empty bar) ourselves to give the barman doing zero something to do, It wasn\u2019t really acceptable. Same story the next day when we ordered coffee and it didn\u2019t arrive for half an hour, that said we fared better than the next door table who got their drinks sooner but ended up with a bottle of water landing on their lap. The waitress was surly - and many of the staff seemed either disillusioned or gormless. The pool bar fared better - and the staff were charming but they still couldn\u2019t get drinks to us when we ordered them three times. Each morning housekeeping staff opened the door of the room and came in despite us still being in bed and the do not disturb sign being on, and on the last day they rang the doorbell repeatedly which was totally unnecessary and obnoxious. The exception of this bad experience was Carlos at the concierge desk who was consistenly good throughout, but not even that could make up for the above. Overall I will definitely go to the W next time- the Arts seems to just suffer from the complacancy associated with being the \"best\" hotel in a city for too long - without healthy competition. At least the newcomer will have something to prove, and even if they do a deeply average job, it will undoubtedly deliver more than this fading star.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cRomantic??? what?!

Ok, no big deal! Service should still be impeccable, I thought\u2026 I bit my tongue when I saw how slow and unprofessional the wardrobe people were moving. Then again, prior to the event, in the lobby in front of the Ballroom where guests were having Cava and starters. My party and I never got a hold of the servers \u2013 obviously outnumbered by the already announced amount of people\u2026 Suddenly we were rushed inside for the five courses dinner, which turned out to have only three while we missed the first two in the lobby. At dinner we found it difficult to have wine in our glasses because the waiters were always busy with other tables. Again, I don\u2019t understand why they didn\u2019t have enough wait staff for such a large party?! Every time we asked them for help, the help was always late to arrive. When one of the gentlemen at our table decided to take action and manage to find a bottle of wine to fill our glasses, the floor manager rushed to our table and admonished the guest!?!? as if what he did was terribly wrong. Next thing I know, when the traditional cold soup was served, which has to actually be poured into the plate, the waitress also POURED it on my evening gown! I mean, come on!! I understand that this might happen to anybody, but this waitress did not even care to apologize. She just left the table like nothing even happened. Nevertheless, the waiters never smiled, fact that I find totally against the concept of hospitality! And then, as midnight rolled in and last course was served, the whole staff cleaned the tables and just chatted looking at us as if they wanted us out the door. Useless to say my party and I left before the evening was even close to be over, and that I don\u2019t think of this location as a high class anymore.", "Date": "January 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cStill THE hotel in Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "Doggy88", "ReviewID": "UR52780160", "Content": "After spending 1 night at the Mandarin Oriental we checked out very quickly and headed to the Ritz/Arts Hotel.

If you don't read anything from my review, at least please retain the fact that this is a seriously understaffed hotel (both in number of people and in the quality of their training) and you should only go during low season / not during a busy time. I took my parents from Dec 31 to Jan 4 there so they can see Barcelona, paid top dollar for the rooms (no points, etc used here) and the hotel basically ignored us systematically. We arrived at 4 pm and made to wait until 445pm, without apologies, in fact, without even being offered a glass of water. The check-in person was positively patronizing. Because they were on a low floor (10th), the rooms creaked like a listing ship as the building moves with the wind. Not pleasant. One of the rooms was filthy as it had presumably not been used in ages, the other (a \"deluxe\" room with an admittedly beautiful view) lacked 25% of all the accessories it was supposed to have, like a remote control for the TV, which was turned on and could not be turned off. It took one hour and all 4 staff to find a remote control. The hotel lacked - a first aid kit - a thermometer - anyone who understood the english language except at the reception desk, which was unreachable by phone - any degree of coordination between staff. on one day you would ask for a laundry bag, nobody would come and then the next morning 4 different people would show up with laundry bags. absurd. And god forbid if you needed to contact reception. Lines would be busy and you would get an answering service. In Spanish. We clearly should have checked out and gone to the W but after my talk with the manager (and his generous offer to comp our first night there and move me to another room) we decided that maybe once crowds left, things would get better. We were. of course, idiots. The cleaning staff proceeded to throw out my camera charger (not expensive but impossible to replace in Barcelona because it is a Mamiya professional camera), water in the bath came out brown, cleaning staff continued to have no regard for the fact that my \"do not disturb sign\" AND my \"do not disturb\" light were on and kept ringing on the doorbell to offer me water, chocolates, etc. Once they rang for a full minute. Why they love ringing so much, I dont know but I suspect they think it s service. At the end of the fourth day I was constantly on edge, afraid to leave anything in the room (for fear not of theft but of incompetent housekeeping) and was extremely relieved to get out of there. The grand finale was the luggage handling. The porters courteously loaded all our luggage in the taxis, were tipped well, and we arrived at the airport with two extra suitcases belonging to some other guest who had left their things in storage! I had to call the hotel, explain to them the situation (in english, and when that failed, in spanish) and wait in the airport until someone came, literally nudged me (no hello, no thank you, no apologies), pointed at his ritz carlton uniform and left. I can only imagine the agony of the other person whose luggage they loaded in our taxi. ( i think it was room 2412) This is a 2 to 3-star hotel with a wonderful view. But it s not a Ritz Carlton.

We arrived via the train and metro from the airport, but returned in a cab. Definitely take the cab, it's only 10 Euros more but the convenience of not having to walk miles underground is well worth the cost. On arrival at the hotel our bags were taken immediately and we were shown to the reception where we were checked in. We were to stay in an Executive Suite on the 27th floor with a view towards the city and also the Olympic Hill. It was breathtaking and way above any expectations I had previously and proved to be the best surprise to my husband. Although we had the added luxury of an additional WC in the suite and a living room with great sofas and a second minibar, we did see a \"normal\" room and these were by no means small and were equally as luxurious, with the same fabulous bathrooms and huge windows. The bathrooms have double sink, walk in shower with additional massage jets [wow] and a seperate tub, as well as a WC in it's own cubicle. The bed was superb with very comfortable pillows and mattress and we really enjoyed the automatic black out blinds which meant we slept so well despite the sounds of the city occasionally drifting up. Breakfast was in a beautiful restaurant with an outdoor terrace and we were able to take breakfast on the terrace as it was very sheltered, the staff were equally as attentive out there as in the main room. The choice and quality of the food was fabulous. Some of the reviews I read prior to our departure said this hotel was in a bad area for seeing the sights and was too far from the main attractions. I really have no idea what the people who said these things did with their time there, because there was so much to do and the best thing was the regular buses and as well as the tourist bus came to right outside the hotel. Hop on a number 57,59 or 157, among others and the buses take you straight to Port Vell, past the Columbus statue at the bottom of Las Ramblas and straight to Parallel, which is the street from which to take the train up to Olympic hill. Grab yourself a T-10 and you can use it for everyone in your party for 10 trips, changing onto the metro is fine as one journey lasts 95 mins. We used this bus in the evening to take us the short ride to Barceloneta, which is the fisherman's quarters between Port Bell and the Mediterrean beaches. This area is a warren of streets and there are many same family run restaurants serving local food and half the price of the main tourist areas. Although we ate in Arola, the hotel tapas restaurant, we much prefered the little places in Barceloneta. Stay on the bus a little further and get off in the square near the Barceloneta metro station. There is a huge restaurant in a building on the port side of the square called 7 portes [7 doors]. This served fabulous paella and again was a favourite with the locals. From all of these places it was really lovely to be able to stroll back up the promenade to the Hotel. The seafront area was very well lit and there were always plenty of local people running, even in the dark!! The Hotel Arts is perfectly located to enjoy the ocean and beach front, yet still close enough to the main sights to be able to jump on a bus. We prefered the bus as you end up seeing more than being underground all the time. Both my husband and I used the spa and it was a very tranquil and relaxing place. The wet areas are seperate for men and women and there is no way round this, but on special request they can arrange a treatment together. The treatments are very expensive and the express menu cannot be used on their own, so your minimum spend will be nearly 100 Euro's. My husband had the Indian Head massage with mud and thoroughly enjoyed it. I didn't have such a great experience with my body scrub as the therapist seemed rushed and was a bit slap dash with applying both the exfoliation and hydration cream. It wouldn't put me off trying the same treatment as my husband though next time. All in all we couldn't fault the hotel. We never heard another guest outside our room and we were so well looked after by the attentive staff, that we wouldn't hesitate in booking again. If you are wondering about some of the reviews, then you have nothing to worry about and it there is a problem during your stay, make sure you contact the main reception and they will definitely help sort it out.

A martini at the lobby bar is 27 euro and forget about room service. 25 euro for a hamburger and 5 euro to deliver it.

Barcelona is too beautiful of a city to spend your time on the subway. We also took the Fat Tire Bike Tour for 24 euro. No reservations are necessary and they meet everyday in front of Sant Juame (city hall). I would recommend this one over the others since I've enjoyed their bike tour in both Paris and London. The downside to Barcelona is the food sucks. They charged us 2 euro for each piece of bread we ate when dining. I can, however, suggest eating at the Gardunya restaurant located at the back of the La Bouqeria Market on Las Ramblas. They have a tourist menu which includes an appetizer, entree, dessert and drink for a reasonable price and the seafood is fresh. We took the AVE train to Madrid which only took 2 1/2 hours.

It is located right above a beach and is probably one of the tallest towers in the city (other hotels probably have at most 10 floors, but this hotel had 45 floors). You can see the W Barcelona (yet to be completed) from the hotel, which I think will be very impressive, and it will probably boost 100% sea views from all the rooms. My review might be biased because I stayed at the Apartments, which is a top floor section of the hotel, with all duplex apartments, with personal butlers, private elevators, and all the freebies. So let's move onto pros and cons Pros - Apartments was the best I have seen - the view of the city and the ocean is to die for, especially, the windows span two floors - Great butler service - with introductory tours, baggage support,.. just everything you need they do it for you - Great Club lounge - I was surprised to see a dinner offering at the lounge, it wasn't hot, but it was good quality food - Evening chocolate and champagne turndown housekeeping with 2 maids! - The free 25 minute welcome massage was welcoming - Great location - right next to the beach and all the great dining places near the beach - Great concierge service - Free still bottled water, free chocolates, strawberries, champagne, chocolate almonds etc on a plate on arrival - Pool and gym 24 hours - Apple computer on desk - if you do the Spa, check out the outdoor relaxation area on the rooftop with sweeping views of the city, skyline and ocean - it offers the absolute best view of the city - All the customer facing staff are quite attractive Cons - Very expensive! Expensive would probably be an understatement - EUR 25 for internet is the highest I have ever seen. A 25 minute spa cost EUR 75 is just ridiculous. Judging by the room service menu, it was also really ridiculously expensive - highly recommend eating at the restaurants near the beach (only a 5 minute walk) - Don't go to the Spa - all the treatments are so expensive - I think a 50 minute massage is EUR 175! Thank god I was offered 2 free 25 minutes massages (but even so, the massage wasn't enjoyable at all - the skills just weren't there) - Small stuff that makes you go like \"Is this really Ritz Carlton\" - from dirty towels left at sun recliners, lack of air conditioning control at the second bedroom, window binds that don't really block the sunlight, bathtub shower nozzles that are positioned at the hip level - Very small pool with really cold water - and I agree with previous comment of not enough sun loungers - the jacuzzi is also barely lukewarm and quite a waste - Staff attitude and service could use some touch-up and proactiveness Overall, it is a great 5-star hotel with the best locations and views in Barcelona, but not without some flaws.

It was virtually impossible to get poolside service - they had plenty of wait staff - they were simply not interested in doing anything.

The never ending smiles, the continued polite interest and the nice small conversations. The great service, knowledge and help. Fantastic! Excellent food and beverage in varied themes throughout the day. On top of this a magnificent view of the sea and the city on the 33rd floor! Thanks to all the club lounge staff for making a memorable stay. Rooms are large and very comfortable with fantastic views. Got upgraded to a corner suite which was even more fantastic.

The view from their terrace is breathtaking! Almost flawless\u2026 yes some issues to think about. This is a hotel originally constructed for business people, so in the summer when tourists arrive, including many families, the pool area is far far too small. There are some 500 rooms and maybe 70 sun loungers. There is a grassy area as well where it is possible to lay down, but no sun chairs. If you arrive later than 10 o\u2019clock on a weekend \u2013 forget about it! No chance! Furthermore there is ONE shower which barely functions. Not sure the size of pool area can be rectified at all, but it\u2019s a pretty important issue to look into. Then, remember to brink a big wallet, most you pay for in this hotel is quite expensive. Example: Smoothie 13 euro, hamburger 22 euro, gin and tonic 22 euro, small bar of chocolate 10 euro, water from mini bar 9 euro etc. Fortunately Club level food and drinks was complimentary, which came as a bonus! Although had dinner at Arola which was excellent and not overpriced in my opinion. The lobster cob salad at caf\u00e9 veranda is not cheap, but hard to beat with a glass of Albarino and the great view! Also, location is not in the centre of town. Takes about 15 minutes to walk to Born area, and 5-7 minutes by taxi to pl Catalu\u00f1a.

Because when you've paid so much for a room, it feels wrong to find everything with a huge additional price tag on it. Everything. To the point that I even worried that the pretty cellophane-wrapped bar of soap I used in my bath was going to show up on my bill. I don't drink, so wasn't tempted by the alcohol in the mini bar. But I was hellishly thirsty - until I saw the price tag for a small bottle of water. 7 euros? And a 24 hour WiFi pass cost 25 euros.

We were there on 2 separate stays and in both cases we needed manager intervention to finally get to our rooms well after the 3 pm ready time. Annoying to be sure. WIFI is doled out for 1 hour a day in the lobby only unless you sign up for an outrageous amount for 24 hour coverage which includes one's room. We did get them to waive the charges on our first visit but were not successful on the second visit. Today with lesser hotels offering free computer access and access to free computers, the Hotel Arts needs to change their policy. I took away one star for these reasons.", "Date": "July 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cSetting standards\u201d", "Author": "Fomych", "ReviewID": "UR33991736", "Content": "The hotel is very nice.

There were young women positioned in the lobby with the sole role of customer service (greeting, answering questions, directing, etc). This is a really nice touch.

The bed was comfortable. Housekeeping provides a nice evening 'turn-down' service, which includes complimentary water bottles with ice, a small chocolate, and soft music accompanied by serene photos on the flat screen TV. A negative would be the cost for internet access. They have a Business Center, and the charge to access the internet is 5 euro for every 15 minutes. Very pricey. Given the high end nature of the hotel, at least the first 30 mins should be provided free. They also offer internet service from the room for 25 euro per day.

If you are looking for lunch, it is much cheaper to go to one of the many cafes right next to the hotel. You can leave your seats at the pool for up to 1 hour and they will keep them for you, so I would suggest you go to a nearby cafe to eat or bring a snack back. 2) The beach further down, past the marina is much less rocky and much more comfortable than the beach in front of the hotel.

They made up 3 different excuses (first a pregnant lady had given birth unexpectedly and had to stay in the room, then it was a client who had been taken to hospital, last after 30 mins they admitted they had simply over-booked us). They offered to transfer us to the nearby AB Skipper, allegedly a 5 star and simply refused to guarantee us any rooms in Hotel des Arts or upgrade us or offer any form of compensation. It was the Skipper or nothing. That week-end, it looked like there was a huge conference in the hotel and there were at least 3 other couples waiting in the lobby with us who also seemed victims of this over-booking. I do not know how many people overall got affected by this organised scam. The worst part, is that we already had paid for our stay through expedia and couldnt turn around as they already had our money. The managers on duty who made up these excuses were Aurelien de St-Gall (night-manager assistant) and Nicolas Kassab. In the end, we had no choice but to go the AB Skipper, which was nowhere near a 5 star (more like 4), was definitely cheaper on expedia (Hotel des Arts was the most expensive option by far) and was undergoing some refurbishment (works on the swimming pool) that week-end. The DVDs players were not even properly plugged in to the TV sets in the rooms ! There are no words to express one's anger and frustration when the managers made up excuses and refused to tell the truth and then refused to either upgrade us or offer a suitable compensation for the damage inflicted.

Just as the metal key seemed a bit out of place in an ultra modern infrastructure, it also appeared a little out of place a Tube TV (ie not flat) in the sitting area of the suite. SPA: wonderful facilities, with spectacular views. Staff was very cordial. Due to the exceptional views it is probably one of the best spas I have enjoyed in my life. Fitness Center: Excellent facilities. Service: The first thing that impressed me was that upon my arrival the staff knew my name before I mentioned it. In general the staff is very well trained, showing great warmth in the treatment and great care. It was also clear that the days of maximum occupancy the services were at the limit of their possibilities, (ie, many people waiting for the concierge, etc.). Problems: 1. TV: it is inconceivable that a hotel of this category has such a poor range of TV channels, only 23 channels of which at least 7 were in Arabic and only 4 in English (all news or business). Even within the range of pay-per-view channels the offering was bad. 2. Internet: While I understand that as a policy of the hotel and as an additional source of income internet access may have a cost, 25 euros per day seems to me like a ridiculous high price. It is not that guests are not able to afford it, but it's a bad sign from the customer point of view that we are charged per day more than monthly cost of the service 3. Finally it should be noted that although it is not the fault of the hotel: the constant sound of sirens from ambulances (hospital sits beside the hotel) makes it difficult to rest even on upper floors (I was staying on 27th floor).

There is a double-decker bus tour stop right outside and I highly recommend taking the tour to see the entire city in a short amount of time. One other slight complaint is that you have to pay, I believe, 25 Euros per night for internet service which at this type of hotel should be included.

The fitness center is one of the best I've ever seen at a hotel and the pool area is absolutely beautiful. As for the restaurants, we only ate a couple of times at the hotel because it is very expensive, though Bites (the snack cafe) was very good and Enoteca is good and very upscale. There are some inexpensive eating options right near the hotel, also. I was surprised that the hotel charges so much for internet access and for using the business center.

There were great products from natural sea sponges, body lotions and wonderfully scented soaps to enjoy. A fabulous tub as well to enjoy a wonderful bath with fragrent bath salts. Our stay included daily buffet breakfast which was very good. The ham selections complete with fur and bone was priceless to look at.

Paid \u20ac345 for room and breakfast. This is a pretty nice hotel, as I guess you'd expect. The lobby is on the first floor, which is a good safety measure, I think. D\u00e9cor is kind of neutral and expensive-looking - lots of beige, grey, cream etc. Some parts of the hotel are showing minor signs of wear and tear - e.g. carpets - but very minor. Check in was fine - arrived about noon and they were able to give us our room straight away. Reasonably high - 14th floor, with decent views of the beach. I did notice later that some of the rooms on the (I think) 2nd floor seemed kind of dark, with windows looking out onto the rear of the pool-level caf\u00e9- I'd try to avoid them if I were you. Great B&O sound system and LCD TV in the room. Also a Nespresso machine, but the hotel charges \u20ac4 per capsule, which is kind of crazy. I know it's a top-end hotel, and you expect to pay more etc, but \u20ac4?! That's a markup of around 1300%. Watch out for the \u20ac45 CDs too. Very comfortable beds, great linens and towels. Large bathroom with separate shower cubicle and toilet cubicle. Breakfast was pretty good - standard hotel buffet in the ground floor restaurant. No eggs cooked to order though, for any egg fans out there. A lot of people have noted that the hotel isn't in the centre of town, but it's only a short taxi ride away. It's within walking distance of the Museum of Catalonia and the Maremagnum shopping mall, though. Both are pretty rubbish, actually, so don't be too upset if you don't include them on your itinerary. The museum has the worst rooftop caf\u00e9 - recommended in the Time Out Barcelona Guide - very unfriendly service and poor aircon, so very hot. The Maremagnum mall has very few shops, and of those there are very few you'd actually like to buy things from. The pool was great - decent enough size, not massive though. A lot of children and families around - more than I had anticipated. Lots of attendants to help you find a lounger etc. Plenty of little Spawn of Satans running around, belly flopping and splashing. Tended to get busy by late morning, all the way through to mid-late afternoon. August is very hot, so there's not much point going out until later, I guess. Although it's a very nice hotel, it's got a sort of tacky/trashy feeling at times. It's built on top of something called \"Casin-Oh!\" and the whole Olympic Port area is a bit cheesy - a lot of naff-looking bars and restaurants around and underneath. That said, we did eat at one place - Bestial - which was very nice. Guests at the hotel are a mixture of Europeans (Italians, French, Germans - some topless by the hotel pool, watch out), and the stereotypical well-preserved cruise ship guests waiting to embark or having just disembarked.

The rooms were very large with great views of the city and beach. We appreciated the light and openness, as compared to most standard European hotels. We had a club room and the lounge and food offerings were excellent. So, in terms of the room, comfort and location the hotel is highly recommended. However, as other reviews have mentioned, the service was not up to par for a hotel of this caliber. I will say that most everyone we encountered was very nice and appeared to at least try, but...for example, we had connecting rooms with the rest of our family and it took two hours (several phone calls, plus my husband going down to reception twice), before someone finally showed up with a shrug to unlock the doors between the two rooms. On several occasions when calling the front desk or operator the phone would ring endlessly with no one ever answering. We were not there for the pool really, but it is very small for a hotel of this size and the couple of times we walked by it was very crowded. A few times we overheard very angry guests who had arranged for things that were not done properly (one person was left at the airport without the ride the hotel was to have arranged for her). For our purposes, we were very pleased with the comfort of the hotel and it was just for a couple of nights.

There was one 15 metre pool (nice large hammocks and loung chairs surrounding it) as well as a smaller almost like a wading pool.

The staff at the restaurants however, were superb. The hotel staff on the other hand missed the mark. Here is where the hotel lets you down. I asked for two types of pillows in the online request. The front desk receptionist confirmed my request. When we got to the room we found the request not met. I had trouble working the phone (I don't know if it was me or the phone). I called for help 4 times and each time I was told help was on the way. No help arrived. I requested a birthday cake for my wife to be delievered at a particular time in writing and recieved confirmation in writing. The cake was not delivered on time.

When we arrived at the restaurant, they had no record of the reservation. When I needed help printing a boarding pass the floor attendant was worthless and gave me the wrong information. Another issue was the pool. There is only one pool which is outdoors. The pool was icy cold so if you go at a time other than high season, you may be in for a shock. The view from the pool is poor. The pool is small and there is not enough lounge chairs. Bar service ends at 5pm (I think) or at least way before I thought it should. There is a casino next door which brought in some guests you would not normally have at such a hotel. Reminded me of a sceen out of the movie \"Swingers\". The crowd around the casino is a bit annoying outside as well. The hotel is not on the beach, but very close and the closest I saw (about 100 yards). All and all, I would not stay there again because the hotel simply lacked the service one expects with a 5 star hotel and particularly when you are paying 5 star prices.

Some people have complained on this site saying it is out of the way and it is true that it is not in the middle of the shopping and business district. However, it is right near some very good restaurants (Can Majo is especially good) and the main sights (Gothic Quarter, Park Guell, Familia etc) are spread out so where ever you stay you would not be able to walk to everything. There are some clubs nearby and a casino underneath so in the evenings at weekends it is very busy (but perfectly safe) around the area. Club Level The Club on the 33rd floor is fantastic. Food and drink free all day (including continental breakfast with an egg station) and excellent service (even arranged for us to have beds by the pool ready for when we got down there). With breakfast in the hotel costing \u20ac39 each (\u20ac29 for continental) and drinks so expensive, club rooms are actually good value.

Comfortable bed, great TV, excellent water pressure and rain shower with side jets, 2 toilets and a funky little living room. I have rarely encountered more efficient and courteous concierge staff - if you need any help finding your way and any advice on what to see you should use them. The pool is smallish and it gets crowded on the weekend so if you prefer the pool to the beach you should probably find a spot before 11am. The mojitos by the pool are the real deal made with real crushed lime. If you prefer the beach, get a towel at the pool and walk out - the beach is right there. I tried the \"degustation menu\" at restaurant Enoteca and it is an interesting experience but you have to be into trendy \"molecular\" cuisine.

High tech and chic, this hotel is stunning in a multitude of ways. Uniformed, professional courtesy and meticulous attention to detail reside in every square foot of this marble and glass masterpiece. The men and women working there all look like Vogue ads or GQ models but act like true professionals. The service, amenities, attitude and property are all truly first class with no exceptions. The high-rise suites (we were on the 28th floor) are phenomenal, extra huge and very pricey with sweeping views of the city and the sea. A large living room, two TV\u2019s, dressing room, two separate bathrooms, a wide hallway leading to a massive corner view bedroom, a full bar and more high tech buttons than anyone requires. From the marble and polished granite master bathroom (you could park a car in this one with plenty of space to spare) to the mood lighting and push button electronic curtains and drapes that covered the massive floor to ceiling windows, these suites and this hotel will definitely please. I was informed by pool attendant and the bellman that several film stars request this suite as well. We decided to enjoy a little pool side time and then the beach before a late afternoon nap and ultimately, dinner. The pool here is five star. Attendants escort guests to their choice of designer lounge seating and welcome you with several lush towels, designer umbrellas and bottles of water. On the beach however, don\u2019t be surprised to see several topless bathers. With the horrible value of the dollar in Europe, cash goes quickly here also. Two cocktails at pool side amounted to a U.S. conversion of $56.00. It\u2019s all relative when one considers that a suite at the Arts Hotel runs $1000 a night, plus, plus. Later that evening, while enjoying a state of the art shower system than can best be described as a private cocoon of marble with multiple and powerful water jets, (LBJ would have loved it) we were getting prepared for our evening on the town before the cruise the following day. We had reservations for a late dinner that night as we enjoyed the glittering lights of Barcelona from 28 floors beneath us. While getting ready, the extensive surround stereo sound system (even in the bathroom) lulled us with Andre Bocelli from CD\u2019s provided ensuite. The concierge desk rang politely to tell us that our driver was downstairs and ready when we were. There were frequently so many black and midnight blue Mercedes S-Class sedans with suited drivers waiting outside this hotel that you\u2019d think it was a diplomatic location. Admittedly, being driven around Barcelona in this manner is a great convenience and goes hand in hand with the culture of this hotel. After a 20 minute ride past the Ramblas into the buzz, sights and nightlife of downtown Barcelona, we arrived at a well established and popular restaurant called Botafumiero. A busy, elegant, old world seafood paradise. Reservations a must. Passing wall photos of famous former diners including politicians and actors, we were greeted warmly and escorted to our table. I had noticed that among the photos were Bill Clinton, Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding and even King Juan Carlos and Queen Sophia posing with the owner. Apparently the Spanish royal family keeps a place in Barcelona and eat at Botafumiero. In a word, excellent. Had a wonderful shellfish broth, a great Cabernet and the Mediterranean sea bass. Slightly brisk but professional service with truly fabulous food. Highly recommended. Later we were driven around the sights and ended our evening at the large and busy casino next door to the hotel. The following morning we indulged in a memorably delicious breakfast amidst the gentle sea breeze surrounded by lush floral gardens and delightful service at the garden terrace of the hotel. This is one of many beautiful locations to eat at this hotel. In a matter of a few hour it was time to embark the Oceania Insignia for our Med voyage.

If value-for-money is important to you, then you shouldn't be looking at this hotel. We stayed in a club level room, and it was sumptuous. We have stayed in some nice places over the years and I don't ever recall my wife looking so impressed at the standard of the room as she did here. The bed was so comfortable. The bathroom was very smart, dual sinks in the middle - one side had a separate room for the toilet and bidet, and a separate wet room for the shower. The other side had a recess with the bath in it. My wife now wants the same arrangement at home..... Staying at the club level gives you access to the club lounge. They have five different buffet spreads on per day, nothing substantial, but enough so that you don't need to eat elsewhere if you don't want to. Plus there seems to be an endless supply of champagne. The service in the club lounge is very attentive, but not intrusive. It was unfortunate that we were in Barcelona for the heaviest rain that they have ever known, and the hotel was not geared up for it. Water was leaking into the club lounge. As a result of the leaks into other parts of the hotel they had to turn the water to the rooms off for most of Saturday afternoon / evening while repairs were conducted. This was incredibly inconvenient if you were there at the time but I doubt that that is a regular occurrence. The location is a bit far from the centre of town, it is at the very boundary of walkable, and that is only if you have a lot of energy. There is a metro station nearby though, and the concierge at the entrance have a button for summoning taxis. As for the noise, we were on the 30th floor and from there we could hear the sirens of emergency vehicles, and the whistle of the policeman directing traffic outside, but not too much else.

At first I was uncertain about the location, being next to the pier and Marina as opposed to the centre o ftown. However, it turned out to actually be a plus, since the weather was gorgeous and it was really a pleasure having access to the pool, beach and pier. Getting to and from the city centre was never a problem, either by taxi or subway. I would say, though it\u00b4s key to get a room with a sea view. Apparently there is construction and scaffolding for all rooms below the 8th floor, and we complained at the front desk so a very nice young man upgraded us to the 9th floor with a beautiful sea view. The room was very nice, not huge, but with a large bathroom and one of the best showers I\u00b4ve had. In general, the hotel was great. Very nicely designed, great food and excellent service with terrific concierges. BUT, it\u00b4s a good thing our company was paying the bill since prices were outrageous. We were charged 18 Euros for a sangria in the bar, and my wife was going to have her hair done in the salon before a black tie dinner until she learned it was 120 Euros. Outrageous. The only other thing to mention is that the hotel was very busy and noisy, perhaps due to a long holiday weekend in Barcelona. Finally, out of our group of about 65 couples, 5 or 6 people were either pickpocketed or had purses, cellphones, bags stolen from them, 2 incidents happened in the hotel. Although the hotel dealt with it quickly and sympathetically, you got the feeling this was extremely commonplace. It\u00b4s a real shame that people had their trips ruined like this.

A warm welcome in club ,but noticed almost every guest after us were greeted with a chilled glass of champagne and we weren't!! Ok we just assumed a slight oversight on their behalf and maybe they didn't have time before our arrival. Anyway ,room was what we booked, 2 doubles on club floor with a view of the beach and the city. But considering we were in Barcelona for a birthday celebration there were no extras in the room, such as a cake, or some chocolates or a bottle of champagne to add a little special extra touch. But we had booked a romance package which included a butler and breakfast the following morning but unfortunately concierge on club level FORGOT to arrange it for us!!!! O.k then, another oversight!!!! Next, my daughter was told she couldn't take her cookies to the room as all food was to be eaten inside the club lounge. Which was fine and we explained to her that if these were the rules then fair enough, until, less than 5 minutes later another guest simply waltzed out of the lounge holding a glass of wine and a slice of cake,while watched by a member of staff who simply smiled at her. At this point we were beginning to get the feeling that this was not a very child friendly hotel, and different rules applied to different people.And we have stayed at 3 other Ritz hotels, all club level and never experienced anything like this strange attitude to younger guests at all. Obviously, we did complain to management who did apologize but they didn't make up for the forgotten romance package, we didn't even get a complimentary chocolate, never mind a bottle of champagne. My overall opinion of Hotel Arts is that it is a beautiful hotel, in a nice location although slightly noisy because of the hotel's position(part beach, part city). Food is nice but not much choice on club level, drinks a plenty though. But staff, who need to work experience in the USA to learn how to meet the levels of service that Ritz Carlton guests truly expect and deserve alongside their children, who possibly are their guests of the future. One final comment which we found EXTREMELY IRRITATING was regarding the lovely flat screen plasma in the club lounge which only played dvd's ALL day. But to add to this misery it played only CHARLIE CHAPLIN dvd's ALL DAY.

The arrival and greeting on formal name terms is endearing and the friendliness of staff genuine almost relaxing after a long journey. Reception is a dream area with the abundance of fresh flora and fauna. I stayed in room 1414 with sea and city views. It was pretty noisy being next to a casino and lots of sirens from police and ambulances all night. The room though was just a perfect size and one of the most comfortable I have stayed in. Bang &Olufson sounds and TV were superb and bathrooms divine. Now the downside of the place. The mini-bar prices are totally outrageous and the most expensive I have ever seen. A beautiful coffee machine was there, work of art but users beware that each and every tiny sachet you use is 4 Euros, each small bottle of water is 5 Euros and each can of Coke 7 Euros, totally outrageous on the VERY expensive rates they charge for the room. Breakfast runs at 30 Euros per person and BEWARE they have IVA (VAT) on everything! So if you want luxury it comes at a cost and this place costs., believe me! At the rate they charge free bottled water and free tea/coffee would be small change for the hotel. The Six Senses Spa on the top floors again is a 40 Euro entrance and includes no extra treatments. The booklet they leave in your room has no price list which begs to make one think if you need to know the price its too expensive for you? To eat in the hotel or use the bar well be ready for really high prices, but fantastic presentation. The area around the hotel has pleanty of excellent local restaurants and bars with great atmosphere, The Agua restaurant was fantastic food and ambiance. Barcelona is a great place and really upcoming. They profess that the Rolling Stones stayed here. Might be nice to see a TA Report from Mick or Keith ..???

The shower, which I'm sure was nice when it was new, was gross and was in serious need of bleaching...I don't care for bathing in a moldy shower (something I would expect from a lower tier hotel perhaps). During our seven day stay the floor in the bathroom was never cleaned. We had an incident where the staff enter our room while we had the privacy light on and when we questioned it, the front desk stated they were having difficulities with their system and perhaps we didn't leave the red light on...which was not true, we we returned to our room the staff person was in our room and the \"do not distrub\" light was clearly on. We inquired about a private tour around Barcelona and were given a brochure for a bus tour - hmmm, I believe they missed the boat on who their target audience appears to be. They also directed us to a closed train station...it appears the rest of Barcelona knew the station was closed for repairs. Another stunning display of customer care was when my husband and I left early to go sight seeing. On our way out of the room, my husband mentioned to me that we were out of toilet paper, we agreed that there was no need to call and request more as this would be taken care when the staff came to clean the room. Upon returning later than evening, we were welcomed to a room with no toilet paper...I guess the cleaning staff and turn-down service were out of it each time the tended to our room. When I called to request a new roll, it took them over 30 minutes to bring us new ones...I wish I was joking. Later in the week we requested two extra pillows and that took over an hour and two calls to be delivered.

It was a modern-luxury hotel, which was fine, but the hotel and the conferences they hosted were out of control and mis-managed. Note About Our Stay: A MASSIVE business conference was going on in the hotel. The attendees were extremely rude, all yelling on their cell phones, conducting meetings in the hallway and elevators, and from what numerous staff had told us, many weren\u2019t even staying at the hotel, but were taking up pool chairs and all the seats at the restaurants, which made all the paying customers extremely angry. The Hotel: The 42 story tower was built in occasion for the 1992 Barcelona Olympic games, and with its sister, are arguably the most visible landmarks in Barcelona. Entering the hotel from a busy street, the porte-cochere had fountains and waterfalls on the right hand side, with a small lobby, with a decadent food store there. Lobby: Going up the elevator to the main lobby, the doors open and we cant even see the floor because of all the bankers and the girls sending them off to their next appointment. However, check-in was fast and easy, with a personal tour of the property with the check-in manager. The lobby, from what I could see, was nicely laid out, with check-in and concierge in the front, with some deep seating toward the back. Room: Taking the elevator up to the 27th floor, we arrived on our floor and to our room overlooking some beaches, the port, the old city, and Montjuic; a very pretty view! In exploring my room, we noticed all of the high-tech touches of the room. Everything electrical in the room can be controlled from the bedside and door side console. The room was of average size and average furniture for a Ritz, but one special thing was a seating area near the panoramic window, which had a heavy lowering shade to keep out the sun and sounds. The bed was very comfortable and had very nice sheets. The bathroom was huge with a separate bath, separate bidet and toilet, and a great separate shower. Very nice indeed. Fitness Center and Spa: The fitness center is located on a lower part of the hotel, after a tricky trek. I never used the fitness center, but saw it, and it looked of a relatively small size for the hotel. However the Spa is located on the top three floors of the hotel, and is brought to us by The Six Senses Group. In a tour of the Spa, a very nice locker room and relaxation area with steam rooms and balconies overlooking the Mediterranean. I imagine it was very nice, and a plus, rarely had any conference attendees. Dining: We dined only at the restaurant off the lobby, because we could never find a seat at a restaurant at the hotel. The restaurant was nice, again the work staff was very short of people, but the food quality was very nice and tasty. Tip: the shops at the Port Olimpic (right next to the hotel) are extremely nice to dine at and are a great way to see some of Barcelona. Cost: For the cost we paid, I should have known something was going on, for a high-200 price for a deluxe room, which seemed to good to be true for a Ritz, and now I see why. Otherwise, like everything else now-a-days, most food were in the high 20 euros. Service: This is the only thing that would bring me back to the hotel. During our stay, we met the Director of Rooms, Sandra, and she was very gracious, insisting to meet us and get our input on the conference situation. She further assured us that the hotel has not invited back many of the conferences for next year for the reason many other reviewers have noticed. Very similarly, Stephanie at the front was very assisting to our stay. This would be one of the only reasons I would return. Overall: A very average stay, while we had some horrible times, we also had some great times and were treated with decency by many people of the staff, who were visibly tired from the conference, looking like many of the over-worked and yelled at airline employees. Now I feel their pain. The service and the rooms would be the only reason I would return. It is very different than many Ritz-Carlton's.", "Date": "July 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, needs a little work\u201d", "Author": "bmarric00", "ReviewID": "UR8099295", "Content": "I stayed at the Hotel Arts for 2 days at the end of June 2007 before a Mediterranean cruise.

For a deluxe 5 star hotel, I was disappointed at the service. When I arrived, the conceirge took my travel case for me which would be delivered to my room after check-in. However, an hour later and a telephone call to the conceirge desk, my case arrived. I just wanted to throw on a bikini and grab my suntan lotion! For the both days I was there, I had to call housekeeping to come and clean my room. On the first day, after spending a busy day, I just wanted to jump in the shower. When I returned back to the room, all the towels had been left on a pile on the floor and the room remained untouched. Needless to say, a maid did come to the room after I had been told that they were busy doing turndown for the evening. I just wanted some fresh towels nevermind about turndown!!. That evening we asked the conceirge to make a dinner reservation for that evening and also one for the Sunday evening as it was a special occasion. On the Sunday, we didn't have a clue where we were going so asked the conceirge desk, which restaurant we had been booked into only to find to our dismay, that nothing had been booked. The lady on the desk then started to ring some restaurants only to find them booked (no surprises at such short notice). By the third restaurant she had called, it was then discovered that a reservation had indeed been made for us but the lady who handled our request the previous evening had failed to tell anyone about it. On returning back to our room after the fiasco with the restaurant reservation, the room had not been cleaned again. Once I can let it go but for a second time, I was annoyed as hell only to be asked that was I sure that I left the light on the door for the room to be cleaned. For those who haven't stayed at Arts before, they do have a simple system. By inside of the door, there are two switches - one to clean the room, one for privacy. Not rocket science but when I complained to the check-out desk that all was not well with our stay, I was told that the switches can be confusing!! Our room was on the 6th floor which you could hear a lot of traffic noise - probably not a problem if your room was higher up. That being said, the rooms are fab, the spa is good with great views from the 43rd floor but expensive. The service round the swimming pool is good.

A great spot to hang on, but lots of 'suits' walking around and lots of messing about with moving pool furniture around. The hotel is now managed by Ritz Carlton and I think the big boys in suits spend far to much time strutting around and getting in the way of the staff. The result - poor service levels as the team seems more worried about pleasing the managers and this means they spend less time on looking after those of us that pay. Lunch by the pool was awful. My starter and main arrived at the same time. My guest did not get her starter and then it arrived with her main! They only had one bottle of olive oil and balsalmic so they kept moving it from table to table - very poor for a five star hotel. Even in the restaurant the service was slow - 30 minutes for a starter. The spa is great. It was wonderful views and is worth a visit, BUT too many female staff keep coming in to the male area and this is very off putting for most male guests.

We also pleased that the hotel clientele came from differing nationalities. We had arrived at the hotel from a stay in Mallorca, where our hotel was occupied almost entirely by Brits. We found the greater range of nationalities of guests at Hotel Arts to make it more a more vibrant and happening environment. The hotel staff were very professional. Restaurant recommendations were generally very good. Service in restaurants was also good. On our first night at the hotel the noise from an outdoor wedding was loud until 3 am making it difficult to sleep. After a few phone calls to the night manager, who handled the calls very well, the hotel provided my husband and I with an additional room on the other side of the hotel less affected by the noise for the evening, and they removed the room charge for the night because of the inconvenience. Our original room was very quite for the rest of our stay. We used the gym facilities daily and found the gym to be well equipped. Our teenage daughters also greatly enjpyed our stay at the hotel.

The customer service was great, and the standard room was no ordinary standard. It was huge with an incrediable view of all 3, the city, port and beach!!! The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was huge! We loved the 26\" flat panel TV and top of the line sound system. Little things like controlling the window shades with a button from the bed made it that much better. We got to see some celebs.

Lovely Crups espresso machine. Huge bed, comfy with a matress topper and very small details, like privacy button (instead of Do not disturb signs) that really made the difference. What can I say about the bathroom. Two fantatic basins. Seperate loo-room. Seperate bath. And the most incredible. hower room with seats. Gorgeous. After that we spent the day overlooking the fantastic fish from the hotel's garden-swimming pool. Only problem there-it was very busy and we had to lay on the lawn and be on a waiting list for a sun lounge. Gorgeous though. Last thing we didnt like. There are spa facilities on the higher floors.

The hotel is a good 40-minute walk from the Ramblas (don't let anyone tell you any different!)but the open-top tourist bus stops right outside the hotel which is pretty convenient for sightseeing. We paid for a deluxe sea-view room which was exactly what it claimed to be - beds were the comfiest I've known in a hotel too. Staff were considerably friendlier than in many luxury hotels and went out of their way to be helpful (not the supercilious look-down-their-nose at you types you often get in top hotels). Do try the Arola restaurant - we nearly didn't, thinking two Michelin stars would automatically mean second-mortgage prices, but it was quite the opposite. The starters are tapas-style (ie you choose a couple each and share) and were just gorgeous. Kids love nibbly things like that and, to their credit, even though Arola clearly likes to come across as funky (it has it's own DJ!) there were lots of families in there. Our 12-year-old thought it all very 'cool' and loved the food (result!) Only real drawback to the Hotel Arts are the breakfasts - the most eye-wateringly expensive I've seen yet. Ours wasn't included in the room rate we'd booked and there wasn't anywhere nearby that did anything more breakfasty than just coffee and a croissant. Also, we'd thought the seafood restaurants around Port Olimpic, just steps from the hotel, would be fantastic, but there are so many chasing the business we were 'hustled' as we walked along checking them out and ended up feeling quite uncomfortable (and the one we chose was rubbish!!) The following day we had lunch in a big seafood restaurant that virtually backs onto the hotel pool (can't remember the name, it was two words both beginning with M!), and had a fantastic lunch outside on their terrace, so would just go straight back there another time.

Staying out here alienates you from most of that (unless the pinnacle of your Barcelona visit is to be a night out at the Baja Beach Club in which case ignore everything I say). 2. The rooms. I think the rooms are in the process of renovation. And they really do need it. 2006 may well be a better year to visit than 2005, when the rooms may well have reached their post-opening (1992) nadir. 3. The pool. Tiny, over-busy, full of kids. Not enough sun loungers by a mile. 4. The cost. Not just of the rooms, but of the million and one overpriced extras that are the hallmark of luxury American chain hotels. As a result, the prevailing feeling all around is of money, not style or class. 5. The alternatives. Hotel Neri for example is fabulous and captures the essence of Barcelona perfectly. On the plus side, the hotel is still clearly very, very good. The views from the higher floors are pretty spectacular. Food at Arola is excellent. Agua restaurant on the beach is a great place for Sunday lunch. And Restaruant Barceloneta in nearby (and walkable) Barceloneta is probably the best seafood place in town. I wouldn't go back, but I'm still happy enough that I went, if you know what I mean.", "Date": "September 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cDecent but not fantastic\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3898085", "Content": "Hotel Arts was certainly a 5*, but it pales in comparison to other 5*s.

Only complaint would be that the gift shop is really weak on things you actually might need while travelling & the public carpets are badly in need of a thorough cleaning or replacement.

BTW, when you totally burn out on tapas, there's a good little Italian restaurant in the Olympic port - al Passatore - very casual, but I had Linguine al Cartoccio - incredible seafood linguine delivered in a swan shaped foil packet.

We stayed 4 nights in their basic room. The hotel lobby, bar and grounds are VERY nice. They all meet the RC 5 star standards you would expect. The conceirge was very friendly and helpful, a must for a city like barcelona if you ask me. My chief complaints go towards the actual room, room service and value. Simply put, the rooms are dated. Old carpet, furniture, fixtures, etc. No movies on demand, no DVD player, only a VCR. Sure they let you borrow movies for free from the front desk, but the selection is limited, VHS quality (combined with the dated POS VCR) and we had to have our VCR replaced because our first one ate the tape. Sure the service was great in replacing the VCR late in the evening and not charging us for the lost movie - but imagine if that were my personal tape, something for work that was destroyed. Totally unacceptable. THe bathrooms were huge for european standards, but unintelligently designed. The sink faucet was underneath the mirror shelf. So for example, if you were to wash your toothbrush off under the water, it would disappear while actually under the water... adn this wasnt some nice euro modern design, it was a design flaw. The shower was huge, but no water pressure. There were misters, but only on one side.... just plain bad design. Room service. We had it once. We had a pizza margarhita and a bowl of their french onion soup. THe soup wasnt edible. Think beef broth with powdered parmesan cheese on top. THe pizza made us sick. (I know it was the pizza and not the soup because its the only thing we both ate) So we spent the evening hovering around our bathroom rather than out enjoying the city. Value - the place is just WAY overpriced. Now, i know, if you are considering a hotel like this you have money to spend. But noone likes to WASTE money. Its just plain silly expensive. Example, one cosmopolitan and one vodka tonic = 36 euros including tax. I have the bill to prove it. THe service was exceptional. Everyone was friendly and helpful. They were never snotty with us desipite the fact we were a couple of casually dressed 20 somethings.... The location could have been better... great view, but far walk from just about everything.
