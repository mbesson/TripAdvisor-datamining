What city.. Will review the hotel first then the city.. We are a married couple age 52/50. The hotel is very easy to find as it is right next to two Metro stops and is only a twenty five minute walk along the banks of the Seine to Notre Dame.The welcome was really friendly when we arrived, as the guy was english although the rest of the staff were french, but all spoke great english.Our room was a corner room on the fith floor overlooking the front of the hotel, it was not the largest bedroom we have stayed in but was big enough for us, nice bed and shower/bath room area. As previous reviewers have mentioned the lift will hold two people with luggage only, but after leaving the suitcase in our room it did not bother us, we mostly used the winding stairs. Our only small gripe was that the cleaners forgot to leave us any bath towels on two of our four day stay, but a quick call to reception soon rectified it. We would stay there again and recommend it to anyone who is thinking of staying in Paris. Location and things to do: If you turn left at the door and climb the street it comes to an area where there are several lovely restaurants and bars..Most serve set menus from around 11euros for a three course meal for one.Drinks are expensive, especially lager,two pints of lager cost us 18 Euros, in a back street bar, buy wine as it is much more reasonably priced. If you turn right at the door gone down street untiul you reach park called Jardin Des Plantes, a great walk down thro the park to the River Seine. We used the Batobus, this is a waterbus service which stops along the seine at various tourist spots, you can buy a day/two day/or week pass. We visited on foot most of the main tourist areas, Eiffel Tower is fantastic at night all lit up, at at the hour it flashes neon light for five minutes.Fantastic. The french seem to eat in the parks alongside Champs Elysees towrds the Louvre when its nice..... Buy a pack of Metro tickets from any station as its cheaper than buying them singularly. Sacre Coeur is worth visiting,but the the street hawkers are a real menace here.. So that it..we took the Train straight from CDG airport and it drops you off in 4 central stations in Paris, we alighted at Notre Dame and walked to hotel in about twenty minutes. Great Place,but its not cheap!", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portsmouth, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat location & value\u201d", "Author": "GolfGrrl603", "ReviewID": "UR126586715", "Content": "This was our first overseas visit.

The Metro station (Monge) is only a short walk to the hotel and Rue Monge itself has a good few eateries and a very welcomed supermarket for all those essentials. The hotel itself is clean (though we did find a large dust ball on the bathroom floor). Bathroom had a decent hairdryer, plenty (and I mean plenty) of hot water - the shower was superb! The room itself was typically small but well equipped with a fan, large double wardrobe with full length mirrors on the doors and shelving and hanging space for your clothes. The windows were large and opened right up to allow in some much needed breeze 9it get hot in Summer) and the best thing was that although Rue Monge (and the cafe just in front of the hotel) can get noisy, the windows more than adequately dealt with this. The bed was very comfortable with lovely large pillows (and extra ones in the wardrobe if needed). There was a minibar with plenty of room for you to store a couple of bottles of your own wine if so desired (and it worked well, so the wine was really beautifully chilled!). The staff were very friendly and personable and spoke English very well. There is a small lift (meant to carry four, but felt very 'snug' with only two!) and a library of books in English, French and German for you to lend (I left our 2011 edition of DK's Paris guide book and map, so if you borrow it, hope it's useful!). We didn't eat breakfast there, but currently it is 9\u20ac per person (I booked via Expedia and although they advised that we would have to pay a local room tax in actual fact, we didn't; but breakfast was NOT included in the price we paid so be aware of that and check your own booking if you get a package deal). There is Wifi and access to a PC terminal (with printer) in the reception, but this is charged at 4.50\u20ac per stay - not too bad really (WiFi was 'free' but you need an access code which they will happily supply to you if you ask in reception). Only two 'moans' really: one was the TV. It works well and can't be turned up to loudly to annoy you or your neighbours, but the only channels in English were a couple of news channels (and not good ones at that!). Now, I know we were in France, but I really do feel that it should not be too difficult to cater to English, German and Spanish etc. guests with one or two 'entertainment' channels. We were lucky, we had a WiFi smartphone so we could watch UK TV clips on Youtube! The biggest gripe has to be the situation with the room key: you must leave this in reception whenever you leave the hotel. Problem is that the key is stored in a pigeon hole system that is in the reception, but is not BEHIND reception (it is in fact, quite an \u2018open\u2019 reception area) and so your key is NOT secure. One evening, we returned to the room to find that the key would not work. Reason? We had mistakenly taken the key to the room next door! And quite clearly, they were not in the hotel as they had left their key (you only get one). If we were NOT honest people, we could have easily gone into their room and... well, it's obvious really! Similarly, 'anyone' could have taken our key and gone into our room too \u2013 I would hope that anyone who just came in \u2018off the street\u2019 would be challenged; however we came in late one night and the Night Porter having never seen us before, happily allowed us to take the room key with no enquiry; I didn't even have to give him our name). We felt that we had no option but to take all our valuables, passports etc. out with us every time we left the hotel because although there is a safe for use by guests, they clearly states that they are not responsible for any goods left in it.

The location is very central, near the Plade du Monge metro station. Very handy! The neighbourhood is very quiet for a big city, so getting a good night's sleep was not a problem! Located in the center of the lating quarter you are only about a 10-15 minute walk from the Notre Dame. The rooms are small, but very cosy - definitely big enough for what you need them for: sleep & shower! The only \"bad\" thing that I have to say is that the beds are a little to short to my liking and my partner's height, but they were otherwise very comfortable! The breakfast is simple & filling, enough to get you started. If you're looking for a bacon-and-eggs style of breakfast you won't find it here. The hotel also offers free Wi-FI, handy if you bring your laptop for some on-site sight/resturant research! We would definitely return to this hotel!

But the desk attendants were friendly and tried to help us although there was the language barrier. We felt very safe here and they locked the front door after a certain time so you get buzzed in by the front desk. We didn't really take advantage of the complimentary breakfast but I don't think it really offered much. We walked A LOT to get to a lot of the main tourist attractions, and we also took full advantage of the city subway system, which had a station a few blocks away.

All in all, it definitely merits its high rating on tripadvisor. On the negative side: The double bed is a bit small for two, or at least compared to what i am normally used to. The walls are thin, so we heard the baby in the next room crying from time to time, hence the lower rating for sleep quality. But I guess this is normal in a three star category in Paris.

Everything had to be perfect! I scoured the internet for the best hotel and, never having been to Paris, I had no idea which one to pick. There are so many! I came upon Saint Christophe on Trip Advisor. I was almost swayed by the negative reviews that talk about the keys not being secure and Hotel Acte-V being better. I was ready to book Acte-V. I asked my husband for his opinion and he disagreed with me. He thought Acte-V looked like a place we could stay here in the SF Bay Area and said we should stay in a place a little more Parisian. He convinced me to book Saint Christophe instead and he was absolutely right. The staff was super nice and helpful. The room was cozy and charming. It was small with a double sized bed but we already expected that from all of the previous reviews, so it was fine with us. Because the hotel is so close to the metro, you'll faintly hear it rumble by on a regular basis. The bathroom was spotless with a nice big tub. The windows were my favorite part. We were in a corner room, so we had two sets of tall windows that actually open like doors so you can lean out and take in the sunrise or watch the bustling city street below. The hotel is less than a 3 minute walk to the Metro, its super close. Five minute walk to Jardin Les Plantes and a bunch of cafes and brasseries. It's less than a 10 minute walk to the Pantheon. I would say its a 20 minute walk to Notre Dame or the St Germaine area, and everything else is totally accessible by the Metro. The offer breakfast downstairs and its decent. A pastry/bread basket, some orange juice and some cafe au lait to get your day started. We only ate breakfast there twice because we wanted to try the food at a few other places to get some variety. The people who work the reception desk were the best part about the hotel though. On our last night, we came back to the hotel and asked the hotel clerk if it would be better to take the Metro or a taxi to get to the airport. My husband and I hadn't been watching the news on our vacation so we didn't realize that a major strike was scheduled for the next day! It was very late so, even though he tried, the taxi company was closed for the night and we would have to try again the next morning. He told us not to worry, and that he would have a taxi for us bright and early. Sure enough, when we were ready to go at 8:00am, the taxi was already waiting for us!

Breakfast is very, very basic youghurt, croissants, baguette - cream cheese, jam tea or coffee. We stayed for 8 nights and after two basic breakfasts (not even the usual ham - cheese or egg options/alternative), we sought out alternate opportunuties. (The little cafe directly across the street from the hotel entrance provides excellent coffee and omlette with bacon for a very competitive price. The owner/manager has a good command of English and it is very convenient and cheap beer and wine for that after walking all day relief.) A minor issue for us was the WiFI access. We had travelled for 10 weeks in western Europe staying at 26 Hotels, pensions and B&B, we relied heavily upon WiFi for e-mails and Skype as a means to keep in touch with immediate family and friends. Hotel Christophe was the first hotel to charge for WiFi access. Not only charge, but the service was provided by an outside source \"\u00d6range\", which was not only expensive 10E for three hours access, but extremely user UN-friendly. You are obliged to log in on each occasion, the usernames and passwords provided are difficult to distinguish between i I and 1 etc. Making each access tiresome. On occasions, possibly due to workload the whole Orange system slowed down making writing an e-mail take twice as long and burning up the Euros. The Hotel Christophe is highly recommended for all the right reasons, however, if you need WiFi access for business or communication, you would need to consider an alternative. Perhaps management might consider an alternative WiFi provider or system as we enter 2010?", "Date": "November 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cA gem in the heart of Paris\u201d", "Author": "Dr_McMonkey", "ReviewID": "UR48876245", "Content": "We stayed here for 5 nights in 2006, on the recommendation of a French friend and previous tripadvisor reviews.

And when I say leave your key with them, I do not mean behind some secure counter where only the hotel staff have access. There is an open cabinet with hooks next to (not behind) the reception desk within easy access of anybody who walks into the lobby. In fact when we first showed up there was nobody in the lobby for at least 5 minutes, plenty of time for somebody to stroll in, grab a key (b/c they know whatever key they pick, that room will be empty) and take whatever they want. For the first couple of nights we just kept the key and waked quickly out of the lobby before any staff could say anything. However on our last night in Paris as we were walking out to get some dessert the guy manning the desk (actually he was on the lobby computer which is supposed to be for guests instead of behind the reception desk) asked for our key. When we explained we didn't feel safe leaving the key he became heated and said it was hotel policy and although his english wasn't good we thought he said he would call the police on us if we didn't hand over our key. We started to fear he would lock us out if we stepped out so we had the pleasure of spending our last night in Paris trapped in our room.

We had already tested the front-desk girl's patience once, when we had locked ourselves out of the room on the first day. Having to climb one flight of stairs to unlock the room for us was clearly annoying her. After that experience, we successfully avoided approaching the front desk during the rest of our stay. Breakfast was included in our rate. It was basic but OK (we quickly learned to buy and smuggle in additional breads from the bakery across the street). Coffee was excellent - and if you are careful to avoid eye-contact with the breakfast staff, they will ignore you. They'll also ignore you if you DO make eye-contact. But who cares - the coffee was good. Free internet in the lobby. The only problem with our room was the street noise. Do bring ear-plugs, especially if you stay during a weekend. So - if you want an affordable hotel in a convenient location, this is a good pick - but we did not find this hotel neither charming, friendly nor extra-ordinary in any way. It's a cheap place to stay - we'd stay there again if the price was right.", "Date": "January 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bergamo, Italy", "Title": "\u201cPleasant and friendly hotel\u201d", "Author": "girella", "ReviewID": "UR22935021", "Content": "We chose this hotel because of the many good TA reviews and it turned out to be a good choice!

As we were arriving on different days, I found that I could not book on any website - or I could, but would not have been certain of getting us all in - so I booked directly with the hotel. They were not willing to offer me the same deals available on websites (inclusive breakfast.. or even a free night) but the price was a not unreasonable 110euros per 'double' room. The \"children's\" rooms were all quite adequate; fairly small but clean and quite comfortable. Ours (24), unfortunately, was incredibly tiny and cramped with barely room to walk round the small double bed, the top of which was hemmed in by the only storage 'cupboards', so if you turned over too energetically in the middle of the night you crashed your elbow against them! The worst part was having next door's bathroom - and the lift shaft - in our room, hence the severe lack of space. So, do ensure that you specify that you do NOT want a room ending in 4! These rooms are certainly not of an appropriate size for 2 people - and would only suit someone a little on the deaf side! The reception staff were charming and helpful in every respect. They did try to see if an alternate room was available for us, but informed us that there wasn't one.

The front desk staff was wonderful in giving directions, checking our train schedule (for traveling to the Loire Valley later in the week), and helping to arrange a tour to Versailles (since the trains weren't running). I have never seen such attentive staff! The rooms were clean--mine was on the 6th floor, had a balcony, and contrary to other reviews, the room and bathroom were of good size. My sister's was on the first floor, had 2 twin beds (kind of narrow), and had an even bigger room and bathroom. BOTH rooms were quiet and comfortable. Breakfast was simple, filling, and the staff were nice--coffee, croissants, rolls, cheese, yogurt, cereal, butter, and jam. The local flea market was great! Meats, cheeses, clothes, and treats!

However, with the windows closed (not an option all times of year), it was relatively quiet. The bed was extremely small, though, making it difficult for two normal sized adults to sleep comfortably. There is some storage space, but the configuration made it difficult to access. The bathroom was clean and functional, but limited space made it challenging to access toiletries for two people. Shower gel and shampoo were provided in tiny tear packages, which we found insufficient for lathering up; bring your own. The breakfast room downstairs is mundane compared to many hotels of this sort, and the breakfast (included in our rate) even more so. While we're used to small continental breakfasts, good bread or croissants make them enjoyable. The service was generally gracious and inviting.

The staff were all friendly and helpful, spoke fluent English, and provided us with free maps. Our room (#62) was a corner unit on the top floor with a small balcony overlooking the Parisian rooftops. Although it was a tiny \"chambre\" it was very clean with a large marble bathroom. In the morning they served a delightful continental breakfast with the best cafe au lait, fresh croissants, yogurt, and cereal. The hotel has an elevator (which is a real PLUS when you have heavy suitcases) and free internet service from their guest computer. Just a few minutes walk up the hill you'll find crowded streets with fun dining spots and outdoor concerts. Notre Dame and the Seine is within a short stroll from the hotel.. We understand why this hotel is always full-it's a terrific homebase while visiting the city of light. Here are a couple of tips for your Paris visit: 1. When arriving by Eurostar at Gare du Nord as we did, if you have more than one piece of hand luggage, take a taxi to the hotel. With tiip and baggage fees, our fare was 20 Euros and it took just about 15 minutes even in rush hour traffic. Attempting to drag suitcases through the underground could be challenging and not worth the extra savings. 2. For an overview of Paris, buy a day pass on the open air bus which has 4 routes. The Grand Tour route takes in most of the major sites. You can hop on and off at your leisure until about 6pm which is a super way to spend a day getting familiar with the city. Price is 24 Euros. Don't buy your pass In England if you are riding Eurostar as it is much mnre expensive sold in pounds. 3. If you are visiting Versailles, either go on a pre-paid tour which is available from the hotel for 39 Euros, or buy your entrance ticket at the Bureau de Turism which is located about 2 blocks on the left before you reach the Versailles gates. Price is 25 Euros. If you wait to buy your ticket at the Versailles ticket office, you'll still pay 25 Euros, however expect a VERY long queu of an hour or more. 4. Be aware of pick pockets, especially in crowded areas. Backpacks, purses, and fanny packs are targeted and you won't even know you've been robbed until it's too late. 5. We found best rates for Saint Christophe at [--]. 6. Learn a little French and have a blast practicing.

The hotel is quite small with a real 'family-run' feel to it. The staff were always friendly and helpful, speaking English. The room itself was quite a good size, but the bed a little small and not overly comfortable. The bathroom was a good size and the shower had great water pressure. There was no airconditioning but there was a small fan which we found quite adequate. There was a bar fridge which was handy for keeping drinks cool. With the large french windows open, you had a lovely view of the street, with all the window boxes in bloom. The latin quarter is a very nice part of Paris to stay in, with a real old Parisian feel. The breakfast room was very small and stuffy in the basement with no airconditioning and as we were in Paris during a rather hot spell, this was a little uncomfortable. Breakfast was OK, with cereal and croissants on offer even though one morning, they were out of cereal. Location of this hotel is great, within walking distance to a couple of metro stations and the Siene. Didn't find the neighbourhood noisy at all.", "Date": "August 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "atlanta", "Title": "\u201cDecent, Functional Hotel\u201d", "Author": "antione", "ReviewID": "UR5456330", "Content": "I've been to paris many times for extended visits and can say with great authority that there are many dumpy hotels there. I know because I've stayed in them mostly because of lousy per diems provided by my company. (Thankfully that has changed). People who complain about Hotel St. Christophe just don't know how bad it can really be. I once stayed down near place d'italie in this hotel that was like some modern chamber of horrors yet it was completely full because Paris was in the thick of its convention season. Let me tell you my friends - the problems I'm reading here about St. Christophe are noting in comparison to some of the hellholes I've stayed in. In any case I do concur that there is a musty smell to the rooms though most places that lack AC wind up with this type of odor. The room was serviced on time, the towels were clean, as were the sheets. The TV was functional (Though I don't have much time for that but do like to check the news before sleeping). The floor was clean, vacumed daily, the bathroom was sparkling, and all plumbing worked well with little noise (if you have been to paris before then you know that this is not a given in many paris hotels). The staff was helpful and responsive to questions. The rooms don't have those mini safes so you will need to store valuables in the hotel safe. The breakast area is clean and is about as big as any of the breakfast areas I've seen in other Parisian hotels of comparable size. Of course by US standards it is small but not by european standards. The staff has no problems if you want to take your breakfast tray to your room. The mini bar wasn't fully packed so I could buy my own water and juice at nearby stores and cool it in my room. I very much liked the large windows, which when even opened a quarter of the way open provide considerable ventilation and help cool things down. The windows have a veil in addition to the curtain that can be used to provide some additional privacy but when you are taking the shower just pull the windows closed. Also keep in mind that *many* places in Paris have no AC so don't think that this is specifc to hotel st. christophe. The locale is excellent as there are two metro stations very,very closeby. The neighborhood is refreshingly UN touristy and is located right next to Jardin Des Plantes - admittedly not the most celebrated garden in Paris but still very nice. For those who want to stay in this area you can eat closeby in any number of places. But for me the metro is so convenient I can be most anywhere pretty quickly. There is a *slight* problem with environmental noise given that some of the side streets have cafes and bars where customers hang out in the street sometimes late BUT again, this isn't unique to this hotel , paris, or many other european cities where space is at a premium and you have densely packed areas hosting residential and commercial buildings. The street that runs along the back of the hotel , rue de la clef, has a pub called \"the iron bell\" and towards closing time some of the drunks stand around outside for a while before going home but its not really that bad. REally it isn't. If you are the type who needs total silence to sleep then Paris probably isn't a good city to visit. That or you need to stay in one of the corporate chain hotels up on champs-elysee where you are paying $250 a night. I have no problems recommending this hotel to anyone. For me, having a clean, safe room ,responsive staff, good location , and nearby restuarants make it easy to deal with the other problems that I consider to be minor.", "Date": "July 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNot upto expectations\u201d", "Author": "ascalapius", "ReviewID": "UR5366014", "Content": "After reading the reviews on this site about this hotel, i expected something better.

The lack of Airconditioning - This presented and interesting paradox. You could open the rather large windows BUT you let in all the road noises and of course, everyone can see you after your shower. I am not kidding about this. The temprature in the room would soar if the windows were closed. There is a small tower fan in the room that did little. NO cieling fans. 3. Breakfast - Very functional, Orange juice, tea, cornflakes, croissants, yoghurt is what you can expect. Its not the breakfast but WHERE it was served which created the problem. The basement was HOT and small. There were 6 tables in all and at best only 13-15 could fit into it. Not something i want to look forward to in the morning.

The location was good but that's about the best thing I can say about the hotel. Our main reason for staying at this location was because we had heard the staff was nice to Americans. This is however not what we encountered. The Asian lady \"helping\" us was so rude on several occasions that we were there. I didn't feel \"singled out\" however because I also heard her arguing with some British visitors as well. We felt like we were inconveniencing her to have her open the baggage storage area for us after we checked in as our room was not ready yet. And don't ask her for advice about restaurants, etc around there because she acts like she knows absolutely nothing about the city. Upon entering our room, we saw that they were very tiny (which we expected so that wasn't a big deal) and opened right onto the very noisy street. Had I not had my earplugs, I would have gotten absolutely zero sleep during my stay. The room was clean but the bed (although a double bed) was so short that my feet hung off the end of it and I'm only 5'6\". It was also very swayed in the middle. Be sure and take your own hair dryers because theirs hardly work at all. And unlike most European countries that have at least one English speaking channel on TV, they had zero. I felt like I was being interrogated upon checking out as it seemed like she just could not believe that \"no, I did not want any of the limited items you had in the mini bar\" and \"no, I did not eat your breakfast that you said was free when we registered and then later said there was a charge for\". The main reason we did not pay to stay and eat their breakfast was because there wasn't much to it and it was in the basement which was quite possibly at least 100 degrees. It was unseasonably warm while we were there and the air conditioner did not work in the room either.
