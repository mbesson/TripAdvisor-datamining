The location is great - lots of restaurants within a 5 minute walk. The airport shuttle is very quick, I maybe waited 5 minutes and the trip to the airport was only a few minutes. Check-in was very quick. First impressions of the hotel are great. The lobby is very nicely decorated and modern. There is a small cafe that serves coffee, tea, muffins, etc. in the morning. Cost isn't too bad - less than $2 for a tea. There is also a Moxie's Grill attached to the hotel - don't even have to do outside, just walk down the hallway in the main lobby. Three elevators meant never having to wait for very long. First impression when the elevator opened was not great. The Sandman is a newer hotel, but it definitely is showing it's age. The carpet in the hallway was dirty and someone had left a glass in the hall (not anywhere near a room door), that stayed there for 2 days. The room looked pretty nice, but again, you can see wear and tear. In the bathroom this was most evident. Nothing major, but there was some plaster peeling on the bathroom ceiling. The desk chair didn't appear broken, but when I sat on it a handle part fell off. It didn't effect the use of the chair at all, so not a big deal. However, I left the part on the desk and it was still there the next day (after the room was cleaned). It was nice having the small coffee maker in the room. We also used the mini fridge, but not the microwave. Everything seemed to work well enough. Beds were VERY comfy, but I found the pillows too high. I personally like a soft flat pillow and my neck was hurting a bit the first morning because of the angle it was at all night. Again, not a big deal. The balcony was nice to have - but I didn't open the door at all, just watched the planes go over. You can hear the planes, especially at night trying to get to sleep, but I wasn't woken up by them at all, so I guess they didn't bother me as much as I was expecting. The one thing that really bothered me was that my silver bracelet became corroded when I went in the pool and/or hot tub. I let the front desk know the next morning, but they didn't really seem concerned. The pool is salt water, so I'm not exactly sure what happened.

The gym and pool are perfectly adequate, the pool being slightly smaller than you might prefer if you are a regular swimmer. The gym has all the cardio and general machinary you could care for, including some weight lifting machines. I often noticed BA and AA air crew using the hotel as Pearson airport is close by and there is an on-demand shuttle service. This is both a blessing and a curse. The hotel lies directly to the centre of the approaches for RW24 L/R and as such is subject to frequent air traffic in the proximity.

Lighting was perfect and provided various mood settings. Very contemporary design throughout the entire hotel. Only concern (which has nothing to do with the hotel) was the restaurant and room service provided by Moxies. I ordered 3 times (appetizer and drink, dinner and drink and breakfast the next morning). Good timing of delivery however presentation was very inconsistent. Never did I receive a side of condiments and/or salt/pepper and at least once I failed to receive a napkin. Also, when I order coffee from room service, I am usually greeted with a carafe of coffee - not a cup of horrible (not VanHoute) room temperature java. Especially at $3 a cup!

(Otherwise I would have never thought of selecting it.) It is a decent hotel, offering the basics that you would expect in a civilized country for this price. It is close to the airport, with free shuttle from and to the airport. It is all right for one night between flights, but I had to stay there five days, which was definitely too much for me. The staff is professional and friendly, I had no problems at check-in, check-out or any other time. The decoration is modern. It is of course a matter of taste whether you like it or not. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. The design around the reception area is laughable; the brown-black-white decor of the rooms is too dark and a little depressing to me. There is absolutely nothing friendly, beautiful or comforting in the internal design anywhere in the hotel. The rooms are kept spotlessly clean. The beds are very soft, which was not a problem for me, but if you have back problems, better stay away from the place. There is a tea and coffee maker in each room, but due to the shape of the pot, the coffee often ended up beside the mug, which practically never happens to me at home. After two days I gave up, tired of making a mess. The sound insulation of the windows is excellent, nothing comes in from noise of the airplanes. This was, however, compensated by the humming of the ice machine and the Pepsi automat right in front of my door. I woke up several times believing that somebody is vacuuming the carpet on the corridor at night, but it was just the two machines. The view from the rooms vary, the lucky guests see a golf course, others may admire the ruins of an abandoned hotel, or the weeds on an empty site. There is a restaurant in the hotel, offering decent food. There you can have breakfast from six \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if the cook happens to arrive on time. I was unlucky in the first morning, and had to wait quite a bit. (After that I did not try, rather saved some sandwiches or cookies for breakfast each evening.) A decent breakfast costs about 20 CAD (breakfast is not included in the room price), but it is not the usual buffet breakfast meaning you have to wait for your meal. The fitness room is OK for a hotel. There is an over-sized public bathtub in the building which they call pool. The hotel has three rather large and fast elevators, so you never have to wait long. If you are into sports and prefer to take the stairs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no, you definitely don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to see those stairs\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Other than golf courses and a fitness center, there is absolutely nothing to do or see around the hotel. It is surrounded by other hotels, office buildings and a few restaurants. There is not even a convenience store within walking distance.

The hotel is within a couple of minutes drive of the airport and it takes about 30 minutes to get to downtown. Our room was $89 per night + taxes. We had a few small concerns: First, the AC is a window mount system in the \"parents\" area, while the thermostat is located in the children's area. This means that the parents room is very cold and the kids area warmer. There is no air supply/return in the kids area and it gets stuffy if the parent's room door is closed. Second, our room safe was locked when we arrived. The hotel was not able to locate a pass key for the entire week of our stay and we could not use the safe. We had access to put our valuables in the hotel main safe as an alternative. Third, our bedding was soiled (black marks) and needed to be changed. After it was changed, the new sheets had a hole.

The price is very reasonable compared with other hotels around Yorkdale mall area. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definite a good buy! We are currently booking this hotel again for this weekend trip. Super helpful and friendly hotel staff and managers: My husband and I booked on line for 2 days trip: Jan 25 and 26. While after we checked in on Jan 25, we were informed that our appointment at downtown was rescheduled. My husband went down the lobby and explained our situation to the front desk and asked whether we could reschedule our hotel date due to our appointment date change. Frankly speaking, I thought the rescheduling was impossible\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 To my surprise, the front desk guy listened to our explanation very patiently and explained this change requires the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approval and he would call the manager. Since it was 9:00pm, the manager already finished his day shift and returned home. The front desk immediately called the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cell phone and left a message. Surprisingly about 10 minutes later, the front desk called our room and told us the manager called back and approved our reschedule suggestion. We are really amazed by how friendly and helpful the front desk and manager are at Days Inn hotel. They are really thinking from the customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position!

Having checked the hotel and compared against others near the Airport, i decided to book. it was just for one night and I came from Sydney. So i had a long flight already behind me with Canada Airlines, where i already got fed up with the service overall. Can you believe that the Executive Lounge at Vancouver airport doesn't even have showers?! However. I booked a Double room for myself and it was considerably cheap against other hotels in the area (Hilton, Sheraton and Holiday Inn). So I did not expect much at all. A bed to sleep in and a functioning TV would have been ok already. I came with a Taxi not knowing that there would be also a free of charge pick up from the airport. It was only 12 CAD anyway. I had two heavy bags to unload. Gracefully the taxi driver halped me since nobody was in front. But yet again, i did not expect it at all. At the friont desk. i got spotted already by a gentleman but he didn't bother to acknowledge me. The lady next to him clarified something with a guest in front of me and asked me to come over after that. She was VERY POLITE and skilled. With her warm welcome (without any welcome drink or other nonsense) with a sincere smile, I even forgot the male agent. She booked me into a room on the 16th floor, which appeared to be the Penthouse floor. I remind you that i booked online and only a normal room as far as i remember, not a suite or so. I ended up in a family room with 1 stock bed in the front room and a nice roomy master bedroom. The view from that room was great even though just overlooking Missisauga Area. it became special to me because a thunderstorm went over the area and the lightnings were amazing. The bed was a big Queensize. The one and only negative point about the room was that the sheets were wrinkled. It looked like somebody else was laying in the bed before but I couldn't make out further details to proof that and so I didn't bother. I slept fantastic. In the morning i had to get used to the shower curtain. You know, if that thing gets stuck at your bump, you almost wanna jump out of the shower but I managed. Breakfast at the attached franchised restaurant and Bar MOXI's was also above average but with small hick up's. The service was casual as expected. There was no Hostess to be find, so i set myself. A young girl in leggings came through to me and handed me a breakfast menu. A little later a waiter with black fingernails and colored eye lashes served me. I found that OK. He was skilled, experienced and polite. The girl in the leggings came back to the neighbour table to dust it as well as the wood on top of the benches and the wall panels. She probably thought, if she does my bench seat as well now, she doesn't have to do it later and went on while I was eating my breakfast. That wasn't very nice. I got a call in the morning that I will be picked up in the evening. So I went to the Front Desk and asked, if it is possible to keep the room until about 6 pm on a dayroom rate. Unfortunately the hotel did not offer dayroom rates. But the lady (not the one from my check in) offered me the same room, I stayed in for 50% and that was just fair. She was also very polite and skilled. The Sandmann's Signature Hotel is one of the less hotels, I would want to stay in longer than just one night.

Amazing value!\u201d", "Author": "cnft", "ReviewID": "UR47670571", "Content": "We booked a stay after reading the reviews here. I am so pleased we did! We got a Family Suite for under $100 USD per night on a weekend. The suite had 2 rooms. The first was a child's room near the door with bunk beds, a TV and bean bag chairs. The bean bag chairs were such a cute, useful touch and our kids loved them. The second room had a very nice, comfortable king-sized bed, flat screen TV, desk and large window. Our original plan was to put both kids in the child's room, but my daughter is only 3 years old and felt too scared to sleep in her own room with her baby brother in a foreign place. So the first night, I slept with my daughter in the child's room. I did not sleep well at all. There was a lot of noise from the hallway and the bed was pretty hard. However, she slept very soundly. The second night, I traded with my husband, and slept in the adult room with my baby. My husband had no problems sleeping in the child's room. He didn't notice the noise from the hallway and felt the bed was nice and firm. My daughter had another good night's sleep in the child's room as well. I am a light sleeper, but both of them are heavy sleepers so it was great for them. The king bed was very comfortable with amazing pillows and a cozy comforter. The kitchenette was great. The toiletries provided in the bathroom were quality products that smelled terrific! The hotel lobby is modern and very nice. The hotel rooms are very nicely decorated. The service I received at this hotel is the best hotel service I have ever had! The front desk staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. Very easy check-in and check-out. We had a problem with a lock in our room that was resolved immediately and courteously. The hotel pool is small, but clean. The electronic room key cards had to be fixed a couple of times throughout our stay as they stopped working. We also had an issue with the temperature in the suite. Most guests staying in a Family Suite want to close the door between rooms - thus, the reason for getting the suite instead of just a hotel room with 2 beds. We were told by the staff at check-out that the closing of this door messes up the thermostat. The heater is set up so that you cannot adjust it manually, you can only adjust the temperature which is not accurate. We were either way too hot or way too cold any time the door was closed. This needs to be fixed by management asap. Also, they provide a hair dryer that cannot be plugged in to the outlet in the bathroom due to the size of the hair dryer plug and the proximity of a screwed down bathroom mirror on the wall. I just took the hair dryer into the bigger bedroom and used the mirror there. Seemed like a strange thing in a hotel so full of great decor and amazing service. We wanted to eat in the restaurant located within the hotel, but walked over to it and determined it was a little too nice for young children. Would recommend to anyone as long as they are heavy sleepers or do not sleep in the child's room of the Family Suite. The hotel location is somewhat removed from the energy and life of the city, but we were more than willing to make that sacrifice for such a great stay. The area on the other side of the highway seemed a little dirty and sketchy, but the immediate area of this hotel seemed quite safe.

Part of the deal there is that you can park your car for about 2 weeks. They have a shuttle service that takes you to and from the airport.

The airport shuttle service picked me up without too much trouble and it was nice to avoid having to pay another cab.

I was pleasantly surprised!! LOCATION- About as close to the airport as you could be. The shuttle was waiting for us when we walked out (we called before we went through customs). LOBBY- Striking is probably the best word. Very, very modern with sort of a \"W-ish\" feel. It's extremely modern, almost with a hard edge. You are definitely impressed and curious about what the rest of the hotel looks like. SERVICE- It was hit or miss. No one was rude, unhelpful, or unpleasant. However, some were friendlier than others. I was kind of getting the vibe that they probably aren't the happiest employees in the world. Just a feeling I got. ROOMS- Very nice. Luckily not as modern as the lobby. Very warm, inviting and cozy. The bedding was lovely and there was a very nice sitting area with a couch and 2 chairs. The bathroom was fabulous! Great tub/shower with cool toiletry items. Almost felt luxurious. THE NEGATIVE- If it wasn't for a few small things I would have probably given them an excellent. One was the inconsistent staff. The 2nd was scuff marks. Yes, scuff marks. In the hallways and in the guest rooms there were myriad scuff marks where luggage, etc has hit the walls. The fact they aren't clean/fixed shows a real lack of cleaning detail. In addition, there were a couple of spots on the carpet where it was fraying. This is a gorgeous hotel with great rooms.

It was AMAZING. When we arrived at the Sandman, the desk clerk (I believe his name was Munir) suggested that we upgrade to a nicer room w. a Jacuzzi and separate living area for only an extra 30 bucks (we had booked on hotels.com, and got a really great rate for the room we originally booked, so an extra 30 dollars was nothing). Once the man said Jacuzzi I was sold. Lol. Upon entering our room I believe I actually squealed with delight! It was gorgeous! Very spacious, very clean, modern, and classy. The room we were upgraded to had a full kitchen -- big fridge, stove, microwave, pots and pans, cooking utensils, coffee maker, kettle, and toaster! It also had a living room w. a flat screen TV and a huge window with a view of the golf course. The bathroom was beautiful, by far the cleanest hotel bathroom I have ever seen and most modern looking...it even had a full laundry machine and dryer! Now...the best part, by far HAD to be the bedroom. The afore mentioned Jacuzzi? Is actually situated IN the bedroom. It was WICKED. The bed itself was also lovely and very comfortable. Another cool feature was that the floor was covered in a carpet that is meant to look like hardwood floor...hard to explain, you have to see this for yourself. You can even order food to your room from the Moxie's restaurant situated in the Hotel (we got breakfast...note--don't get the French toast...it was entirely drenched in a VERY sweet strawberry syrup). Overall, we ADORED this hotel and will definitely be returning! It was a lovely way to celebrate my birthday, but I would also highly recommend it to those in need of somewhere to stay when having to stop over in Toronto as it is located very close to the airport.

I read the reviews here on Trip Advisor and thought the Sandman Signature sounded wonderful and most reasonably priced! Here are a few things we found about the hotel that we did and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like. Some things are, of course, a matter of preference. CONS: 1. AC Unit is in the furthest corner of the room with furniture blocking its cooling ability. This also caused the bathroom to remain rather warm. 2. The room is VERY dimly lit even with all the lights on. The lamp at the work desk has an energy saving 60 watt equivalent fluorescent bulb. If we had been there on a business trip, needing to read documents and such, it would have been very difficult. The best lighting was over the beds. 3. There was no ice bag in the ice bucket. Not sure if this is by their choice or the maid just forgot. It was late when we arrived and did not bother to call and request one. 4. There was no signage as to where the ice machine or vending area was. The hotel is new and they might not have gotten around to putting it up yet. When we found it, it was in an area of the hall with three rooms right across from it. We were glad not to have gotten one of those rooms. (see pic) 5. The remote for the television was not fully functional. It would not change channels. 6. We requested an early wake up call. When the phone rang we tried to answer the phone next to the bed. It was then that we realized it had no cord and did not work. 7. The showerhead, though nice, sprayed a wide angle\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6so much so, that when I turned it on from outside the tub, it sprayed me, as well as the toilet and floor. 8. The tub wall is VERY tall to step over when getting out of the shower. 9. When we checked out, we mentioned that there were some minor problems with the room, the ladies at the front desk just smiled and did not ask any further questions. PROS: 1. The room looked nice and was clean. 2. The bathroom has a wall mounted, lighted make-up mirror. 3. Plenty of towels already in the bathroom and they were very soft and absorbent. 4. Bed, bedding and linens were very comfortable!!! 5. There is a safe available for use in the closet. 6. It is close to the airport, yet we only heard one plane fly over. BOTH: 1. The drapery allowed light to enter the room in the morning. Personally, I like it because it helps me wake up. My boyfriend prefers total darkness, so as not to be awakened by the intruding light early in the morning. 2. It has free WIRED internet connection in the room. So we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t both be on our computers at the same time. However, free internet is good. For the price and convenience, this hotel is not a bad choice. They have done many of the main things well\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 a clean room and comfortable bed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to pay attention to detail.
