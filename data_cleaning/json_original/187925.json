You might get the odd 20 years old blonde with her group of shouting friends to show off a bit but eventually they go away to leave place for an older and calmer crowd. The suite I was given was one of the most expensive and felt like home: great linen, good bed and really great mix of good furniture and surroundings.

The hotel is an old London hotel. It has a lovely restaurant, in which we only ate breakfast. There is a great library bar, with a piano, which was always pretty crowded, no matter if it was the afternoon or 1 in the morning. We stayed in one of the few rooms that had two beds, which were both twins. The rooms were clean and the bathroom had both a shower and a big tub to soak in. The room was extremely quiet. The service was okay. We had a butler assigned to the room, who showed up within minutes of checking in. I gave her some articles to be pressed and never saw her again. I had to call the concierge the next day to find out where my clothes were as they were never returned. We also had trouble with our room keys, as they wouldn't open the door to our room. They were finally replaced. Small aggravations, nothing major. The hotel was very expensive as were the restaurant and bar but that's London. The location was great, as the Tube stop was almost directly in front of the hotel entrance. There is a little bakery down the street, and a great pub around the corner.

However, as should be the case, they were embarrassed rather than making us feel so. The replacements were delicious, so Veggies, you can go for afternoon tea and get something to suit you; as well as the usual cucumber or egg sandwiches, there was mozzarella and tomato, avocado and beetroot, pepper wraps etc. My favourites were the scones and the caramelized onion and blue cheese tartlets. Despite not really having eaten anything that day, I ran out of steam before all the cakes, though my husband manfully continued. The ambience was delightful - pianist, warm, friendly, buzz of conversation. (Maybe something other than songs from the shows, though I guess that suits a lot of tourists - light jazz or classical?).

Having stayed in a few 5 Star hotels in London over the past year or so we both agreed that this is by far the best, and the one that we would choose to return to. Everything about this hotel is just right - the location, the ambience, the rooms, the service, but above all the understated elegance which makes it so special. There is no air of pomposity here, but a warm and friendly atmosphere that we really appreciated. The Rooms are not huge but perfectly adequate in size, and sumptuously equipped. Very much an Old English style of room, but with Hi-Tech additions that are cleverly hidden in the background. Beds and linen were as you would expect them to be - highest quality. If we had one gripe it would be the speed of the hotel internet. It was painfully slow, but this may be more to the nature of the building itself, which looks like it was is hewn out of solid rock many years ago. There is a butler in attendance at all times, but this service is unobtrusive and only visible when you need it. They also do a very fine job of pressing clothes if this is needed. The Bathroom was rather like something from the Orient Express with lashings of wood panelling. The products provided are excellent, and you can purchase these from Reception. Although \"old fashioned\" in appearance, everything works perfectly. We had a very good Breakfast in the delightful dining room, and were welcomed and looked after by all the staff we met. All other public areas have a grand feel about them, and in particular the Cigar Room was just wonderful - there is nowhere else like this in London. Well worth a look at this, even if you do not smoke, but I would not recommend it to people who have recently stopped smoking!

Easy to walk or tube to anywhere. I mentioned the bar. Fantastic place to just be for a light lunch or cocktails. The rooms look like they were from the 18th century but all the most modern of conveniences discreetly hid. And the best part is the staff. In that low key way which is so typical of high class Brittan, they take care of every need and with the discretion and style of those who tend the property across the street (Buckingham Palace).

The staff were bend-over-backwards accommodating (until we requested the Rolls take us to town at 11pm...no driver on duty)...the Cigar Bar was fantastic and the staff there really knew their stuff. We spent a great percentage of our evening in The Library drinking extremely well-mixed martinis and cocktails, nibbling on olives and nuts, chatting to the waiters and generally watching the world go by. We had a fantastic recommendation for dinner at a local steakhouse (see other review) and another recommendation for bars, clubs and general nightlife venues. While the room we had was clean, comfortable and what you would expect from a St Regis, it was small, slightly dated and worn- and I don't mean in a 'quaint' way. I can think of other places to spend that sort of money on that are a step up- but perhaps without the title, pomp and assumed grandeur. The three meals we ate in the hotel were well worth the lunch menu prices but our breakfast bill was \u00c2\u00a334 for a coffee (filtered) and two croissants- both which would have been nicer down the road at Paul.

I thought this was very good as not many afternoon tea places offer this. The hotel was as beautiful as always and as I had requested we were sat right next to the pianist who asked us if we had any special requests for him to play which was a lovely touch. The service is usually very slick and professional, however, on this occasion, they forgot to order the gluten and dairy free afternoon tea which takes 40 minutes to make (even though we did give the required 12 hours notice and it was on their system). They really did make up for it though as they gave us an extra glass of champagne each and an extra fruit platter so it didn't spoil things at all. They also brought out a special cake on a plate that had happy birthday written on it in chocolate which was also very thoughtful. Our waiter was very knowledgable and polite, he explained what each course was and when we requested extra sandwiches, it was not a problem at all. I would definitely go back again becuase even though they made a mistake, they made up for it really well.

The fresh flower displays in the lobby and throughout were magnificent and have to be seen to be believed. We left wishing we had opted to spend our whole honeymoon here and with nothing but fond memories and a desire to return. Anniversary?! I know my spectacles could be considered 'rose tinted' as I had just had a wonderful wedding ceremony to the woman I love, but such a high is a fragile and precarious thing which can be brought crashing down very easily by the slightest of faults. We encountered none.

This hotel is ideal for both business and pleasure. Not uploading additional pictures as the pictures already posted give a fair picture of the hotel. Pros: Complimentary butler delivery of tea to room each morning. Full-length New York Times (not just the Times Digest usually on offer in hotels abroad). Wide variety of vegetarian options in restaurant including at breakfast. Incomparable traditional decor. Lovely library bar and restaurant. Attentive and prompt concierge service and staff. Breakfast, for which the otherwise high cost was included in our room rate, was delicious and so voluminous as to supersede lunch. Delicious and copious selection of tea. Complementary use of laptop computer and good working desk area. Sophisticated but intuitive control panel for everything in the room. Cleverly designed bed-mounted reading lights enable one person to read while the other enjoys total darkness. Butler available to unpack and pack your luggage. Complementary pressing of one garment per person upon arrival. Ideal location, atop the Hyde Park Corner tube station at the convergence of Hyde Park, Green Park, Piccadilly, and Apsley House. It is an easy and pleasant walk to those and other major attractions such as Buckingham Palace, Kensington Palace and Gardens, St. James' Park, St. James' Palace, the Mall, Horse Guards' Parade, War Cabinet Rooms and Churchill Museum, and more. Cons: Water leaked copiously from shower onto bathroom floor. Room 112 apparently sits directly across from a service doorway which we could hear constantly opening and closing along with staff talking. Was erroneously charged for a clothes pressing which should have been included with the room charge. This was however promptly corrected. No pool but go during warm weather and swim in the Lido in the Serpentine, practically across the street. Small television considering the price of the room.

Even Geoffrey Gelardi, the Managing Director agrees. My wife and I wanted to be pampered at The Lanesborough again, so we booked a room for a week - July 6 to 13. On the second day a request to make a couple of restaurant bookings was dealt by the concierge so casually that it left me in disgust. I managed to call the restaurant myself and get confirmation. I went to the desk and mentioned that they needn't bother with my requests as I had got the confirmations. Not a word of query or apology. My feedback on the customer survey form at departure, received prompt attention and the right noises from the MD himself. He asked me for a name of the concierge attendant but one does note down names in anticipation of writing a complaint. The desk maintains a register of such requests so they should be able to find the delinquency if, as the MD said the attitude was unacceptable. Everyone else was great, particularly the butler was a gem of a guy. But alas, the unpleasant behaviour of the Concierge, stuck so hard that looking back, I regret that we did not once indulge in the afternoon high tea that we normally have taken even when we have stayed elsewhere, nor allowed their spa to pamper us or booked a table at Aspleys. Instead, we walked across to the Metropolitan (Como Shambala), to Theo Randall at the Intercontinental Hotel or even to the Wolseley for brunch on Sunday. This may have been our last stopover at The Lanesborough. We prefer the Metropolitan rooms overlooking the Green Park. Though their spa is very basic they have excellent therapists. An irritant that I did not record in the hotel survey, but looking at this questionnaire, I add for the benefit of your readers, water flooded out of our shower on to the floor. The morning and evening turn down service took care of it but I would have thought the engineering department should have been notified by the maids. The room was a good size one, well furnished, very cosy with a private library. The view from the windows on the second floor was not the greatest. We did not miss the fridge or the iron as the butler was just a call away, but I am sure if asked, most travellers would prefer these in the room.

You walk in and somehow you seem to have the place to yourself although it might be completely full of Guests. We arrived early around 10 a.m. and was greeted by Michael who immediately handed us the keys and his co-worker ( the lady that showed us to the room) was kind and very polite which is how it should be. Yes, you pay very good money but that in itself should tell people that the expectations are much higher. You step out of the hotel with the Hyde Park and the bustle of London at your steps.

The Housekeeping/Front Door and Bellman...you guys deserve great tips and more. I Loved it and will be back often and look forward to sending my family there soon as well. Please understand everyone that I do have high expectations and if there are some issues, I expect them to resolve them so don't think I am a easy Guest.

I am always amazed to see places/people with attitude...the only thing that separates us from others in staying at places like this place is our willingness to pay the price so I enjoy it when there is not the attitude. Class cannot be bought. I think Julia Child made the best comment of all in places of eating....IF they have to push their attitude on the patrons...walk out since the food can be bought at 50% less price elsewhere without the attitude. The Staff in the Aspley Rest. for dinner was excellent. I am having a challenge with the choice of menu they chose,however, the staff was top notch..review the menu prior to reservations. I have eaten at many 3*,2* and no star places and rarely do I see much difference in the food other than the service and presentation. I learned this from reading many Julia Child's comments.

It would have been difficult enough for one person to fit in the room, having my girlfriend with me made it almost impossible. We literally could not both fit in the main room at the same time. I am not complaining about the size of the room, I am complaining that it was sold as an \"Executive\" room and that I was charged over 600GBP for it. I very rarely do this, but the size of the room became so confining that I had to check out and move to the connaught which offered a room quadruple the size, for half the price.

Room is OK - bit small for the price and getting a little bit worn. Also pretty low ceilings so a little claustrophobic. Bed a bit soft, but I had an OK sleep. Insulation fantastic - could not hear a thing. View - not sure if you could describe it as such - looked on to a small balcony with some plants, and you could peer through the ballustrades 1 metre from the window at the Gherkin building - so is that really a view?

I have stayed at most of the hotels in London so I thought I would give the Lanesborough Hotel a try. I flew in from Los Angeles and went straight to the hotel in a taxi. I had not had a chance to change any money to pounds yet so when the bellman asked to carry my bags I declined. I did not tip him for holding the door for me and he was not pleasant( I have read in other reviews that this is an issue). I was not sure what I should have tipped him for and I would have more than made up for it when I had pounds if he was pleasant. At the check in I inquired about a corporate rate as my company uses around 500 room nights in London ( about 75 just for myself) and I was curtly told that they do not honor any corporate rate. They must be doing quite well to turn down this offer of business. The second day of my stay I received a call from the \"butler\" to ask if I wanted my room cleaned. I was in the shower so I declined. A few minutes later I heard the chambermaid enter my room and I asked her to come back. We went out to dinner and upon return I received a very cold stare and he turned his back to me from Michael who was working the front area of the lobby. Tired of the poor treatment I called and asked for a manager. I filed my complaint and was told that I would receive a call back. I also noticed on Saturday eveing(April 10th) that a Mercedes Benz McLaren car that was parked out front was being driven by the door man with the door pointed to the sky. The door was bouncing on the hinges as he drove away. I would not be very happy if that was my car. This is easy to verify this action by watching the cctv cameras on April 10th. I would be very cautious to leave any car at the valet. On Sunday while I was sleeping the do not disturb sign was still on the door and another chamber maid came into the room so they do not respect your privacy!. If you plan on using your room for any type of business be warned that the lighting is not sufficient. Upon checkout I still had not heard back from anyone about my valid complaints and I was told that they do not call guests before noon as they could be sleeping. Keep in mind that 36 hours have passed at this point. The staff was never warm nor inviting. The lobby smells like strong cheese when you depart and enter the lift.

The waiter said you can go in the bar, which we did. nobody showed us to the bar, or carried our champagne in for us.Being RUSHED really spoilt our experience of the Lanesborough.", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAll good but if you like classy don't go to the Library Bar...\u201d", "Author": "Supermara", "ReviewID": "UR42676787", "Content": "... unless you don't mind staff with a lack of respect and proffessionalism, rude and loud.

The cakes and pastries were little miniature works of art: the attention to detail made it almost a crime to eat them....but absolutely delicious as well. Overall, Tea at the Lanesborough is our top tip for anyone who asks what they should do when visiting London. Take a good couple of hours: sip tea and eat slowly (you get a lot of food: sandwiches, cakes, pastries, teacakes and scones with cream, jam and lemon curd!) and see how the other half live for the afternoon.

Great location to start with and first impressions of the reception etc, were very good. We were briefly shown round and then to our room by a very attentive chap. The staff in general were all a credit to the place. Our room was lovely and very spacious. The bathroom was a nice size too and the bath was very luxurious. One gripe here however- there were lots of pretty wrapped bars of soap dotted about the place, but why no showergel? It seems odd. Afternoon Tea was lovely as expected. The one thing I would change is to stop the staff constantly topping up your cup of tea. I understand they want to be attentive but it's not as simple as topping up a water glass with more water. You have a cup of tea, get the amount of milk and sugar right, drink half of it and then someone pours in more tea , diluting the drink you have, thus requiring you to add more milk, sugar, etc. Why not let people enjoy one cup of tea at a time? The Library bar is definitly worth visiting. I had a very agreeable nightcap in there. The bar staff were all very friendly and worked the room well. Serving drinks efficiently but chatting to customers at the same time. Breakfast the next morning was also excellent and rounded off a great weekend. It was marred only slightly by the sight of what appeared to be a dead bird caught in the netting above the glass roof and flapping merrily in the breeze. I wonder if anyone else has noticed it and whether it has been removed yet? All in all, a lovely experience and one we are sure to repeat.

We then booked a table for afternoon tea in the Conservatory (now Apselys) which had been awarded the best tea in London by the Tea Guild that year. It was magical! Our next visit, we decided to stay there. We did not realize until we went on the website that it is in fact a St. Regis hotel, which we visit frequently in New York. Being a St. Regis, perfection is what you get and nothing less, however you also pay for perfection! We have stayed here twice, both equally as lovely. Our first stay, a beautiful limo picked us up from Heathrow and took us directly to the hotel, upon check-in we were given a lovely tour of the lobby, restaurant and bar area which we were familiar with but it didn't matter because we had arrived. We were taken up to our Buckingham Suite which offered magnificant views of Green Park and the Constitutional Arch. The butler service was again perfection! Our butler provided us with personalized stationary, laptop computers with internet access as promised! He was also extremely helpful in securing hard-to-get theatre tickets to the newly opened Mary Poppins. We only ate breakfast and afternoon tea in the Conservatory but enjoyed them both immensly and would have stayed for dinner/dancing if we had more time. The Library Bar is extremely enjoyable and distinctly British with a knowledgeable bartender and an extensive selection of drinks.

Our personal butler came up a few minutes later to make sure we were happy and all settled in, aswell as to show us how all the in room technology worked. The bathroom was also really luxurious with a walk in shower, deep spa bath and more amazing views of the park!

Across from Hyde Park, at the end of Park Lane, a stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throw from Piccadilly, and a short, pleasant walk to Harrod\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The room is small, but elegant. Nice bathrooms too. However, the room has a very small television for a luxury hotel and, inexplicably, lacks a refrigerator. Toiletries display no brand on the container. Likewise, alcohol is placed in the mini-bar in small sealed decanters with no brand names on it (a small tag informs you what brand the decanter contains). Very classy!
